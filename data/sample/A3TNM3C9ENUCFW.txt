I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this movie which I found to be art house at it's least pleasing. You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these "critically acclaimed" dramas it's missing one vital thing. Most stories have a beginning, middle and an end - and this just leaves you hanging after nearly two hours, saying "What?"

Like others I took a chance on this hoping for a different angle on a first person sim, or management fight game, and should really not have bothered. The gameplay is pretty straightforward, but even with a 256MB video card, the graphics are pretty bland, and the gameplay slow. It's also another game where there are too few levels of play to actually be able to achieve all the game has to offer. For example, there is a good interactive section of equipment, fighting slaves, upgrades and impressive array of weapons, but financial constraints and sheer playing time invloved make them almost inaccessible. Another main complaint would be (for me at least) an easy boredom threshold - this game could have, and should have been much better, despite the price.

I don't want to be critical of Tim Burtons "Batman" with Michael Keaton as the first caped crusader, which was fresh, dark and engaging when it first hit the screen, but this is better.Christian Bale brings vehemence to the role not seen before in my opinion, and although the story suffers (like all first installments) of a good deal of story explanation the end result is arguably the best Batman flick to date.Bruce Wayne, as the story goes, witnesses his billionaire parents being murdered and after finding no peace through adolescence into young adulthood sees what slender grips he has on truth and justice vanish as their murderer looks set to walk after an early parole.Disillusioned with the rising crime and general lawless mob rule in Gotham, he seeks anonymity and sets off to the Far East to witness the criminal mind, and lifestyle first hand, ending up embittered in a hell hole prison somewhere in the middle of nowhere.Enter at this point Liam Neeson (in another mentor role) who takes the raw and angry Wayne and subjects him to a tortuous training regime high in the mountains, in the hopes to enlist him into the "League of Shadows" a group of Ninja exponents thinly disguised as vigilantes, with some rather extreme methods and ideas on justice.After completion of his training, Wayne however, turns Neeson and his goons down and returns to Gotham to set about administering his own brand of justice to the decadent masses. With the help of his butler Alfred (played very ably by Michael Caine) and Morgan Freeman as a scientist working for Wayne Industries, he creates Batman, and then the story really begins to unfurl.This is a very good movie, and considering the talent on display is not (I'm happy to say) a CGI festival or cartoon revenge story. Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe as well as those already mentioned are well cast in their respective roles, and there is a real polished feel to the whole picture.If I had to make one complaint it would be the new techniques used in close quarter fight choreography that seem to be the norm these days. Very quick and choppy, may be realistic, but it does nothing for the eye, and in some ways reminds me of older movie special effects that were always filmed in low lighting to hide the stunt work.Other than that, just about everything is here, villains a plenty, the necessary love interest, and the whole story told anew, with a fresh approach that seems to stay faithful to the DC comics creation. I actually forgot about the other Batman movies while watching which is testament to the production here. Will Batman thwart the bad guys and save the day? - you'll have to see for yourself. I for one can't wait for the next installment. Great Movie! - Enjoy!

Two years after the hilariously funny, and new comic styled original came the sequel (inevitably I suppose) and sadly was nowhere near its predecessor in comedy or durability. Perhaps the lack of the Zucker team at the helm helped steer this vessel on to the rocks, as it certainly dived at the box office pretty rapidly. Don't get me wrong, this is still funny, but is really only a reworking of the original movie, only this time using a Space Shuttle as the doomed aircraft. The main characters are all back to reprise their roles with the addition of William Shatner (who's presence and role are one of the high points of the movie), but unfortunately the director just went with the same formula, and the lack of fresh material, makes the movie lumber. Fans of the genre will no doubt find plenty here to keep themselves amused, and the budget price means that your home collection can be completed quite inexpensively if you have the original, but otherwise this is a bit of a let down. I desperately wanted to give more but 3 stars is a stretch.

Considering that Lee Ann has been around for a few years now, this album is deemed to be her breakthrough hit. Sadly, despite the wonderful and moving &quot;I hope you dance&quot;, she seems to have been pidgeonholed with so many other up and coming female stars, as to releasing &quot;what sells&quot;, instead of exploring her own creative talents. Not knowing whether to be country, new country or country pop - one could easily close there eyes, and mistake most of the songs herein for anyone of her peers. Despite her wonderful vocal range, something gets lost in the shelf wrapped collection of mundane and flat songs on the album. A great pity, after a single release that promised so much more.

You will have read words like &quot;Awesome&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, and &quot;Epic&quot; in reviews of this movie, which can be a little too flattering. Made in the style of Cecile B DeMille type sweeping saga's it IS a very good movie, with a great script and wonderful performances all round, especially from Oliver Reed, in this his last movie. However, it seems to have fallen foul of it's own misconceptions that films of this genre need to be long to be artistic. Truthfully, the running time could have been shaved by about 30 minutes, and little would have been lost in entertainment value. Russell Crowe's performance is both powerful and believable, and the camera work is both stunning and inventive. This is a good movie, but one can't help feeling that many viewers will find it somewhat protracted and a tad on the long side.

Vin Diesel returns to the big screen in the Chronicles of Riddick playing the title role, and reprising his character from the lesser known, but more polished Pitch Black (2000). Now more of a household name Mr Diesel has a wider audience, and much larger budget, which should have meant more, but fails to deliver on several levels. The set designs and CGI are impressive, and a familiar but somewhat inventive story pits our hero against a band of marauding futuristic Nazi's called Necromongers who travel from World to World and either convert or annihilate it's inhabitants. Some fill work explains the connection between the two movies, and we learn that apart from being a resourceful (and indestructible at times) criminal, our hero is also a "Furion", part of a thought exinct race, who are the only ones capable of defeating the villians (according to prophecy). Another subplot explains that the young girl saved in the last movie is now also incarcerated on an offworld penal colony and needs to be saved, and of course Riddick is pursued throughout the movie by bounty hunting mercenaries trying to cash in on the reward on his head. All this handled better would have made for a great movie, but the action bounces around in a muddled fashion, and makes the whole experience protracted and leaves the viewer a little weary. This is NOT a bad movie, by any means and will appeal to fans of this sort of action flick, but throughout it is more than a little inconsistent. The script constantly calls for Diesel to remain ice cool, and have plenty of smart quips, and 007 style remarks throughout the 2 hour running time, whilst trying to purvey a sense of desperation and destruction which doesn't tie up. If you enjoy spectacular Dune style depictions, and lavish special effects, this is the picture for you, just don't take it too seriously, as the director seems to have unfortunately done.

I felt sorry for this movie for losing out at this years Oscars to Peter Jacksons - Return of the King, and feel that against any other competition it would have certainly swept the board. Russell Crowe is superb as Captain Aubrey, guiding his ship and crew in a search & destroy mission against an enemy French vessel of superior fire power and speed. My brother actually commented that you could almost "smell the bilge" whilst watching this movie, and I have to more than agree in it's attention to detail, and wonderful realism. The vast spectacle of it all is let down a little however by a fairly mediocre storyline, but despite this and a marginally annoying ending (let's leave the door open for a sequel) it is thoroughly enjoyable. Certain to be one of the DVD releases of the year there are some nice extra's on the 2nd disc, this collectors edition will run you around and extra $10, but the goodies are worth it, and the standard version has no special features at all. All of the performances are strong, and the power of the movie lies not only in it's breathtaking art direction, but also in the viewer being completely pulled in to the lives and actions of the main characters. Mild violence, and some graphic war scenes probably proclude this from a mainstream family audience, but otherwise it is a true sea faring "ripping yarn", full of high adventure, excitement, and plenty of swashbuckling thrown in. Good for a least a couple of viewings, this is probably a safe bet for the home collection, instead of merely renting. 4.5 Stars.

Now almost 30 years old, this classic comedy series is still holding it's own against today's more contemporary material, and being discovered by a whole new audience. US viewers who may not have been exposed to it, may miss some of the more subtle aspects, but any fans of John Cleese, or more recently Mr Bean, will certainly find it memorable. It is NOT however Monty Python type material, for those expecting more outrageous, and off the wall satire. Basil Fawlty (Cleese) is the owner and operator of a modest seaside Hotel, and is more than ably supported by a great ensemble cast. Ever hen pecked by his domineering wife, often outsmarted, or assisted by his clever maid, and constantly frustrated by his pidgeon English speaking waiter, the results are hilarious, witty and very amusing. Some of the episodes can make the viewer cringe a little (at the frustrating aspects of Cleese's character) but the overall picture is enormously pleasing. If you have never seen Fawlty Towers, you have certianly missed out, and the DVD collection is the best buy, with ALL epsiodes, and some great extra material included. You will laugh, and laugh again at each side splitting episode which manages to be funny, without be overtly sexual, full of innuendo, and reliant on cheap laughs. Great entertainment!

Peter Jackson seems to have a habit of keeping me up late, as this is the second time I have gone to see a premiere at Midnight. Now whereas I was not quite as enthralled as I was with ROTK, this is still a stunning spectacle, even if 3hours is bit of a marathon.The set design, and base for the story are that of the 1933 original flick, set in depression hit New York, and starring Jack Black as a zealous (to say the least) film producer. We find him running from his financial backers after they decide to pull the plug, and charming and bribing his way onto a ship bound for "Skull Island" to make his masterpiece. Along the way he picks up struggling stage artist Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow, and manages to delay Adrian Brody (as screen writer Jack Driscoll) on board long enough to not only avoid paying him, but getting him to finish the movie script he intends to shoot. I'm going to end the synopsis here, as too many reviews have gone into way too much detail (spoilers included) already, and most people know the original anyway (this one albeit mirroring that only loosely).Once on the island we meet Kong, and as well as a whole host of Weta SfX departments creations in some great scenes, although some are rather silly it seems.The picture is not exceptional, but from the point of view of enterntainment it's great. Visually stunning, and very fast paced after thirty minutes or so, you will laugh, jump, and even squirm at many of the scenes. The acting is top notch as well, and Jackson still it seems has a knack in the Editors chair as well. It was nice to see Andy Sirkis in a support role, as well as many other recognisable faces. A lot of people have bemoaned the overloaded CGI, but this IS entertainment folks - if they had had that kind of technology in 1933, they would have used it, trust me. My only real complaint is the running time, this is NOT LOTR, and didn't need to be 3 hours long,(even the restored original is only 104 mins) and sometimes too much padding gets in the way - case in point is the ending, which is especially drawn out. All that said, go see it for yourself - it WILL be one of the most talked about films of the holidays, and sure to rake it in big at the box office, so treat yourself and see what we're all talking about. Great fun, a bit too scary for younger viewers, but overall a Very Good (if not quite Great) remake brought up to date. Enjoy

I'm reviewing this movie again, as I just deleted the last one which was bombarded with "unhelpful" votes. It seems that the point I was trying to make has been missed for the most part, so I'll try and reiterate.This is an excellent movie from the point of view of acting, direction, and script, and as I predicted it did of course win 4 oscars recently, to rubberstamp that viewpoint, most desevedly and notably for Hilary Swanks incredible performance.All that said however, the movie is slow to start, often plodding in dialogue and continuity in places, and regardless of how masterfully portrayed, it's a very depressing picture. As previously stated, Eastwood has of late immersed his directing (and acting talents here) into the stark realities of human nature in their most raw and naked state, arguably having a free reign like most other renowned directors, by not being entrenched in hollywood "crowd pleasers" as if caring less about the financial success or failure of the picture at the box office.Clint plays Frankie Dunn, a long time boxing manager and expert corner man "from the old days" as narrated by Morgan Freeman who is desperately embittered with an approaching old age laced with regret and emotional torment. His current title hope ditches him for a high flying competitor, his estranged daughter returns all of his letters unopened, his priest admonishes his cantankorous debating, and Freeman is an uneasy friend/employee and former talent who was blinded in one eye after his last fight (something which Frankie also blames himself for). Enter Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30 something down to earth woman encumbered with a past of zero opportunity, and humble but tangible dreams, despite her trailer park family ties. Her desire to follow her dreams to box, and her tenacity and stubborness eventually win over Frankie who decides to train her after initially refusing several times, and against his better judgement. What follows is a symbiotic relationship on which both characters thrive, she becoming a surrogate for his own estranged daughter, and he a surrogate for her dead father whom she admired and misses terribly.The movie turns from this point into a rags to riches to rags picture, with a sombre tone that whilst being absorbing actually leaves you feeling pretty miserable. I'm not criticizing the flavor of the film, but even the most ardent of human drama fans will find the lack of ANY levity to be amiss. Combining euthenasia into the story adds more fuel to the sobriety of everything, and regardless of your political or moral affiliations on the subject, most will agree that too many plot holes, and unlikely inconsistencies make the ending seem unecessarily protracted.I have always been a fan of Eastwood, both as an actor and director, and have seen most, if not all of his movies, and rarely have a bad word to say, because even the most sombre of topics has been balanced, lifted where necessary, or even had funny moments. "Lightening" the subject does not mean that the viewer will take the subject lightly, and although a movie does not have to be a comedy to be entertaining, it shouldn't be morose either. Like Mystic River before this, Clint has proved he can handle some thorny issues with as much mastery as a western or any other genre, just from a strictly personal point of view however I think the lighter side of his talents would be most welcome in his next project.

Based on the little known Philip K Dick book "Do androids dream of electric sheep?" from the 1960's this is one of Ridley Scotts earliest and probably best outings. Harrison Ford plays a futuristic Philip Marlowe type character, hired to track down some runaway and villainous human cyborgs. A moody and dark picture, it captures a pretty bleak image of the future, but carries some touching sentiments about the endearing qualities and failures of human beings, and the films climax is both touching and memorable. Initially a little disjointed at the beginning of the picture, and at times surreal in directorial quality it is nonetheless an exceptional movie, with an excellent script, and cast - Sean Young plays the very beautiful romantic interest, and there are also some early outings for Daryl Hannah, and Rutgar Hauer. Although the Sfx are somewhat behind today's computer aided wonders, the fact remains that this is a very well made and believable movie. As if this weren't recommendation enough the film also contains a stunning soundtrack by Vangelis, which was not actually released until recently. There are several versions available including wide screen and DVD but be warned however this more recent "Directors Cut" release was actually a bad idea, cutting Fords talkovers, and leaving more questions than it set out to answer from the original movie. One of the best Science Fiction Films of the last 20 years.

Following the cinematic release of this years retelling of this factually based story, interest is renewed in this dated, but still hugely enjoyable John Wayne epic. An impressive, if diverse cast of A list stars (for the year of production) do much for the flavor and intensity of the picture, which although a little lumbering in places, is a very accomplished piece of film making. I will spare the synopsis, as most viewers and collectors will know the story, but think it is enough to say that this will go down as a classic in the genre. Waynes flag waving, and at times almost overbearing political ideals are very much apparent in the fabric of the picture, but this should not disuade you from a very entertaining western. I use that term a little loosely, as it is more than a western, and was groundbraking in more ways than one at the time of it's production. The DVD also contains a very intimate and interesting peek at the movies production in a special documentary which more than adds to the value of this (now keenly priced) release. A movie that will grace any home collection, and well worth the money.

I have also written a review for the Widescreen version of this movie (having seen both) and as great as this movie is, something gets lost without the full picture. So much is made of Computer graphics these days that some movies are often slave to their design, but not this movie. As stunning and believable as the action sequences are, they take a back seat to an accomplished and gritty performance by a talented cast. The script is great, and the characters are very close to what one feels the real people this movie is based on must have been like. Apart from one small action scene, poetic license seems not to run amuk here and although you probably know how the storys ends, it is none the less engaging and gripping. I saw this movie at the theater and am still a believer that this is the best place to see a specatcle such as this, but was impressed with it's transition to VHS. The film also has an enduring quality that will mean it can be watched several times, and won't be a &quot;watch it and let it gather dust on the video shelf&quot;. A great addition to anyones home collection, but the widesceen version gets the extra star on the rating.

The fact that this movie is based on the true story of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas, (a small town high school football team who threatened greatness) makes it all the more absorbing, but the power of the film lies behind the visual aspects of the sport itself. Like myself, many eschew such comments made in sport such as "It's not a matter of life and death, it's more important than that" as misguided exuberence, but herein you can see the overwhelming effects and importance placed on sport, particularly in the more insular smaller communities of this nation. The story concerns the aforementioned Permian Panthers and revolves around the coach and a key group of players, their lives, their emotional and physical struggles, and their passion to win. It also exposes the pressures of winning and losing placed upon such young shoulders by their familes, friends, and seemingly the whole town who revere the sport with almost religious fanatiscism. It is uplifting, dramatic, emotionally stirring and compelling to watch, regardless of your sporting allegiances or prior knowledge as we follow their story. Not being a huge football fan I was somewhat sceptical before watching, but found the film to be surprisingly well balanced and un cliched, with a solid if relatively unknown cast. I won't spoil how the movie turns out (although any internet search will provide answers for those who don't like surprises) but recommend it to anyone with a love of drama, as much as sport. This is a slice of real life hometown America (Texas in this instance), and although many outside of the USA especially, may miss the point, it is a sober reflection on the highs and lows of growing up within that environment. Good movie with some factual extras on the DVD as well as the usual trailers and deleted scenes / commentaries etc. Enjoy.

Watching this movie you can be forgiving about a few things:1) The subject matter is in very bad taste2) The story idea is totally ridiculous3) The acting performances are less than polished.What you cannot however forgive is the fact that this latest gagfest from those auteurs of gross-out comedies, Bobby and Peter Farrelly is actually NOT funny.I am a firm believer in the premise that "making light of a subject" does NOT automatically mean that the subject is being taken lightly, but that having been said, any moments of levity here are very few and far between. The acting performances are as you would expect, neither great or excessively bad, but the real problem for me was failing to tackle such a thorny issue as Siamese twins by making it insulting rather than humorous.

David Jason is still fairly unknown here in the USA, and in fact is more popular in England for comic performances than his sober portrayal here as the redoubtable Frost. This is a far cry from most US police drama's and Jason plods through each episode with didactic deliberation, cleverly piecing clues together, and bringing criminals to justice. There is an unspoken charm to his character who is both likeable and frustrating, carrying scraps of paper as aide memoirs constantly as he solves each case. Something of an anachronism, he is an old fashiioed policeman, with what he sees as outdated morals, and practices - but his quirky style is moreoften than not, more than a match for his lawbreaking quarry. There's no eye popping action, explosions, guns or even over the top story's here, so adrenaline junkies please steer clear. Almost a latter day Sherlock Holmes, Frost is an intelligent, yet down to Earth, blue collar detective, resolved to getting the job done. This collection finds four middle of the road episodes that represent the series well, some may find that the structure of each one precludes repeated viewing, but you almost come to love the character, and this is a well rounded set for newcomers, and fans alike. Very well done. Enjoy!

Jackie Chans latest offering in a kind of Indiana Jones in a Tuxedo sort of movie. Plenty of comedy, action and the usual impressive Chan choreography, but the script is weaker than some of his more recent movies, and this makes the film feel a bit flat. Good fun, but don't get your hopes too high.

Adaptation of ANY science fiction is difficult, but taking a work like Frank Herberts &quot;Dune&quot; requires large directorial cohonas. This was Heavily panned by the critics, but is actually a great movie to own rather than rent, for 2 main reasons.1)It's a classic of the genre2)You'll need to watch it at least twice to figure out what's going onThis is the theatrical version, and there are two other versions in circulation, a Japanese laser disc version some 50 mins longer, and a fully uncut version (accredited to Alan Smithee as director after Lynch withdrew his name in protest) some 7 minutes longer than that. Running time here is about right, and although puritans will say the full version is better, it actually makes the movie even more protracted and bizarre that it already is.The plot is actually mildly simple - 2 opposing warring families from different planets come together to try and gain control of the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune)the sole depository in the universe of the all powerful (and essential to space travel) spice melange. One of them is being surrepticiously backed by the Emperor in an attempt to have the spice for himself, and the other just may have a legendary saviour in the form of Kyle McClachlan, able to deliver the desolete planet from the bonds of tyranny, and liberate it's indigenous population (know as the Fremmen). Unfortunately, even if you're familiar with Frank Herberts work, the directing style of David Lynch (who is weird most of the time anyway) makes the movie even more confusing, and leaves way too many questions unanswered for the uninitiated viewer. I loved the movie, even though it nosedived at the box office, but there is an eerie mysticism to the whole production. The visuals that were pretty great for the year of production are lavish, and the musical score is also well placed. The cast list is pretty impressive too, both upfront and in cameo, and all members play out with a fine tuned sense of immersion into the story. The bottom line however remains the same, MOST people watching this for the first time will probably be saying EH? and if you can endure it, several viewings are needed to make sense of it all. Classic but confusing - Enjoy

I recently acquired this DVD marathon condensed version of the Sci Fi channel original series, that sets out to underline the more well known David Lynch movie (which I have also reviewed) and fill in the blanks so to speak. If you have seen the theatrical version of the other movie you will recognise some scenes and dialogue that are verbatim, and justly lifted from the excellent book by Frank Herbert. Therein however begins the problem, if you HAVE seen the other movie, this is a lumbering, and ultimately too long adaptation that tries, but never shakes of the "made for TV feel". The acting isn't bad, but it isn't great either, and you feel that most of the characters are reading lines, rather than living the story. Another grumble would be the casting, as some of the characters come across as so unlike what one expects, they detract from the story in a critical fashion. If this is your first taste of Dune, you may find this review overly critical, but what this film made up for in better special effects, and more complete storytelling, than it's theatrical predecessor it completely lacked in believable acting. Aside from William Hurt, there are few big names here, which may be another reason the finished product is less than polished, and as much as I have tried to like this, the David Lynch film (albeit shorter) does much more to capture the "spirit" of Herberts epic story. Worth a look, but don't get your hopes up too high.

Ron Howard's hardly tiptoeing into the western genre with this fairly graphic and violent story concerning abduction, white slavery and mystical powers, and the end result is actually fairly good. Cate Blanchett has to reluctantly call on the aid of her estranged father, to help track down and rescue her daughter, kidnapped in an Indian ambush early in the picture, and Howard cleverly weaves the resentful divide between the two main characters, whilst hinting at, but never promising a reconciliation, in the subplot that runs in tandem to the main story. The acting performances are excellent, particularly from Jenna Boyd playing the younger sister (somehow overlooked in the initial raid), who joins the search party, and some excellent panoramic camera work graces the movie throughout, showing the isolation, and dangers of the time, period, and place in almost tangible form. Eric Schweig is frighteningly villianous as the mysterious witch doctor indian leading the band of kidnappers, and the movie promises much in the way of tense intrigue, and powerful viewing. Running over two hours however seemed to me to be an over indulgence, and one feels that Howard stops the action a few too many times along the way to sniff the scenic roses, so to speak, which does more than break the movie up a little. Tommy Lee Jones is as usual, excellent in the role of Blanchetts father (the once white man &quot;gone Indian&quot;) who pulls everything together in the story, and adds much credibility to the script. Often very graphically violent, as well as in suggestion, this movie could also be cross genred to a supernatural thriller in a more contemporary setting, which shows the depth of the direction. As it is however, a good, but not a great movie. Enjoy

This reworking of &quot;The King &amp; I&quot; was subject to a roasting by the critics at its theatrical release which reinforces my opinion that professional film critics no zip about &quot;normal&quot; people. This is much more than a costume drama, and is actually a better film than that upon which it is based. Jodie Foster delivers a versatile and stunning performance, and is more than ably supported by Chow Yun Fat (who up until now has been seen mainly in John Woo type thrillers). This film is epic in quality with sweeping landscapes, excellent period detail, and acclomplished cinematography rarely seen this year. You will fall in to this movie and enjoy every minute of it, humour, passion, drama and a sturdy script make for 2 hours of real entertainment. You will not be disappointed !

Fans of Kevin Costners previous avenues into the western genre will certainly not be disappointed by this movie, and his obvious love for the material is certainly in evidence. This is a simple story concerning &quot;free grazers&quot; or wandering cattle herders that drift from place to place, feeding their cattle on the land as they go, usually only suffering from the ravages of the weather or terrain. A run in with a local avaricious land baron (aren't they always) leads to some strong arm tactics by our protagonists, which leads to a show down, and one feels long overdue come uppance for the main villian (played with some zeal by Michael Gambon). At almost 2hrs 20 minutes this is by no means a formula western, but the power to captivate the viewer for so long, with such an essentially short and simple tale is testament to the film makers credentials. Costner is more than ably supported by Robert Duvall as the crusty experienced cowhand, who won't lie down and take a beating, and a romantic interest in the form of Annette Benning is also interwoven well into the story. Some amazing camera work, with jaw dropping vistas and a real feel for the story and characters is more than enough eye candy, and although a little predictable, this is well worth a rental. Interesting extra's on the DVD add to the value, and whereas I wouldn't put this in the same league as Wyatt Earp, or Dances with Wolves, it is very close. Enjoy

I always believed that the only reason one would &quot;remake&quot; or &quot;remodel&quot; a winning formula would be to improve it, and this is certainly NOT the case with this movie. The original &quot;Mr Deeds Goes to Town&quot; with Gary Cooper, isn't really comparable from the point of view that movies of that era (1930's)had a magical, almost surreal quality in delivering comedy, with underlying proverbial messages, and were not crass and exploitative. This modern retelling of an old story is fairly simple (and has been done many times)as we follow local &quot;hayseed&quot; nobody (Sandler) suddenly being discovered to be a millionaires aire. Therein we are to be treated to his funny exploits adjusting to his new life, whilst retaining his simple country charm, and bringing humility to the ignorant upper classes with common grace. I'm not a Sandler fan, but don't criticize anyone who is, as comedy is so subjective, that having been said, this really is a very very poor performance. Formula laughs at their worst can't save a weak script, and whereas fans will like this kind of aimless distraction, it's funny how most people who have reviewed the movie seem to be more impressed by John Turturro's cameo, than that of the films star. Probably a good one for teenagers, but hardly memorable.

The demise of the hollywood musical has been taken up recently by Disney who have incorporated some exceptional soundtracks, and storytelling into there more recent animated features, but it's movies like this where they found the knack.It's all here, good old family values, adventure, action, romance, a great cast and script and no sign of an AK47 wielding hero, gratuitous sex, or special effects anywhere.I have had this on video and NEVER tire of watching it, even when it appears on TV! - at a sneak over 90 mins it's a must, and don't be fooled - my kids love it as much as I do, proving it to be timeless to each succesive generation.

If television serves only to fill the void between commercials, as others more eloquent than myself have said, then Seinfeld is right up there with the best "fillers" of TV sitcoms of recent years. Having seen most, if not all of the episodes on reruns I am pleased to see the upcoming DVD release, finally being made available. What I am looking forward to most of all however, is the original episode length - most reruns are trimmed to allow for the aforementioned commercials on non network stations, and even episodes you may have seen countless times, feel more complete. Comparing the original network shows with reruns is almost like a "directors cut" I noticed little nuances and subtle scenes that made what were previously often disjointed episodes, make more sense - often with hilarious portions trimmed. The "show about nothing" as it was billed was hugely succesful, and like others I concur with some criticisms levelled toward the more fantastical plots (especially after season 3). All that said, if you are a fan, this will be an essential purchase. The DVD set is billed as being loaded with extra's from commercials to featurettes, and the all round package represents pretty good value. I am looking forward to getting the set, but will say that as much as I like Seinfelds wry observaional comedy, I think watching the whole first seasons back to back would be a bit numbing. However, as a long term viewing investment, I don't think any lover of great TV comedy will go wrong here. Enjoy!

This is one of the better movies to come out of the Disney animation studios in more recent years. Older viewers will take comfort from an artful production, which works well on all age levels, and is very enjoyable family viewing. This reminds me of the Disney movies of old, a great story, laughter, sadness, fun and adventure, and some moral values thrown in for good measure. But what makes gives this movie 5 stars is what it doesn't have - unlike the recent releases of the last few years, it is NOT a musical, with characters bursting into song every 5 minutes! It seems that Disney have gone back to the winning formula and great balance of story, music and vision, something that was reflected at the box office following it's theatrical release. This is a truly wonderful film, and even though you know the story you will want to see this movie again and again. A great buy for Christmas!

It's interesting to know that Ray Charles himself had a great deal of input into the movies content before his death in 2004, as well as selecting the recordings (some old, some newly adapted).I've long been a fan of Ray's music, but knew very little about the man, and herein discovered the many sides to his character. A devoutly religious man, he was also a heroin addict who suffered with habitual infidelity, and many a bad decision along his road to fame and fortune. Many have noted the connection between his drug addiction and his lyrical talents, but the movie delves deeper into how Music was not only his salvation, but also a shield and an extension of his inner self that helped him try to overcome his blindness. Being a black man in racially segregated 1948 America, and coming from very humble beginnings in Florida would have been hard enough; but carrying the disability of no sight also from aged 7 leaves one hardly being able to imagine the difficulties he overcame. The movie centers on the 50's and 60's predominantly, and the period detail and recreation are excellent, as is the supporting cast. Another review has mentioned how you forget that you are watching an actor, such is the strength of Foxx's portrayal, and that in itself is a mammoth task when dealing with any biopic, let alone a musical icon of Charles stature. Well deserving of the Oscar for best actor, Foxx undoubtedly carries the film. The music is great, and the selections chosen for the movie mirror perfectly the era shown before you. I highly recommend this movie, not only to those who enjoy Ray's music, but to anyone with a love of great drama, and an interest in one of the great entertainers this country has produced. The DVD is also packed with extra's that I didn't have time to view (as I had only borrowed the copy I viewed) and the sound and picture quality are excellent, especially when used through a surround or auxiliary speaker set up. Great Movie - Enjoy!

James Toback's venture into the world of sex=power is a little too protracted for my taste. Neve Campbell shows a broad talent, and is much more than just a bimbo to look at, embracing the character with a believable maturity not seen in her earlier films. This is a sort of arthouse rendering of Indecent Proposal meets last Tango in Paris that asks more questions of it's own script than it answers. The acting is pretty good all round, and although the sex scenes are far from the steamy impression given on the DVD sleeve, they aren't gratutitous or seedy. All that said, boy oh boy is this dull, and you know it's a bad sign when a movie with a running time of only 81 minutes, catches you clock watching. There is a real attempt to portray intimate drama, power plays and the use of sex as a means to an end, as Ms Campbell bounces between boyfriend and millionaire, but you always feel like you were dropped in the middle of a dissertation, and are missing the back story, or relevance to what's on screen. Not an easy flick to catagorize, but certainly not a movie for those seeking tittillation, and those reviewers who have condemned it for lacking in adult material should seek diversion elsewhere. I hate to see a good idea dragged around in such a protracted fashion, and tried to enjoy this movie. But it will however, not live long in the memory of most viewers I suspect.

I can only imagine that the sleeve design of this DVD was hoping to grab the attention of Red Shoe Diary, or Hunger viewers, when the film itself couldn't be further from that genre. A very clever piece of film making though it is, as we see three separate stories revolving around a funeral that happens at the beginning of the movie. Unlike ordinary flashback style pictures however, this shows the same story over from three completely different angles, keeping the viewer absorbed, whilst peripherally catching parts of the other two stories played out behind the one being watched. This is a story about ordinary people in a small community united in the loss of a friend, and in an almost "Wonderful Life" homage, the ramifications of that loss, and effect had on all who came into contact with him. A quiet Isle of Man (small island off west coast of England for those unsure)community where most people know everything about each other anyway, adds to the flavor of the story, and although you could hardly call this movie, action packed, sexually charged, or even gripping - it is strangely, and almost beautifully compelling. Each little cameo is well acted and very believable, and although it has a cast of little known or unknown actors, don't be put off. Not a movie to appeal to all tastes I'm sure, but highly enjoyable.

It's difficult not to compare this movie to Ron Howards (now classic) Fireman yarn, and this is probably the first dedicated firefighter movie since that one was released. There, however most of the similarity ends, as this is most definitely a thought provoking drama, rather than an action flick. The pyrotechnics and visual effects are of course impressive, but they take a back seat to a gritty and realistic story that underpins the whole picture. Rather than "A Day in the Life" style flick, this is more like a "Life in One Day" (or just over 90 minutes to be precise) condensed story of firefighter Jack Morrison, played extremely competently by Joaquin Phoenix. The opening scene finds a 4 alarm fire in Baltimore harbor, and our character becomes trapped in the unsafe inferno after an explosion, and begins to reflect on his life. Therein lies the story quite simply - we are shown in flashback sequences his journey from fresh faced single rookie, to seasoned pro with wife, family, responsibility and everything in between. There are some funny moments, the usual male bonding scenes, but always a sober reflection, that is never heavy handed on a difficult job, done day in and day out by many unsung heroes across the country. John Travolta as the fire chief, station commander, friend and mentor is excellent, and seems in my mind to get better as he gets older as an actor. This is not a special effects junkies movie, nor is it plodding biopic, but balances the two well, and makes for absorbing viewing. Dramatic and at times harrowing, this is not a movie for a younger audience, but I heartily recommend it to anyone who has ever been interested in the real work of the emergency services. Great Movie!

We were lucky enough to receive this as a shower gift from some very dear friends, and to be honest would probably not have one otherwise. Having said that, I now wouldn't want to be without it, it is a really good piece of equipment.You can use it with or without the screen on (particularly good at night) and it is fairly portable and lightweight. The base unit is easy to install and unobtrusive, and it seems very well made. I've had mine now over 16 months, and considering that it is on EVERY day, it looks built to last. Two minor points to remember though - If you have a lot of Portable telephones in your house on the same frequency (900Mhz) or Wireless computer adapters at the same frequency you can, and do often get interference on the sound and picture quality, when they are in use (phones especially). Also, at times I need to reposition the screen in certain rooms to improve reception (possibly due to wiring or other interference) These two things aside it's a great buy - If you consider that most regular monitors (without picture) are almost $60, it's really not that much more to spend. I highly recommend this product.

One of Jackies earliest movies in a starring role, (released in tandem with Snake in Eagles Shadow) that many would say started him on the road to stardom. I'm told in their native country, these simple storylines were churned out almost weekly and all pretty much follow the same formula. Similar to Saturday morning cowboy movies from days gone by, for Western audiences. The fact that Jackie has appeared in over 90 pictures, probably supports that fact. Here Jackie becomes student to a wisened old beggar who happens to be an expert exponent of "Drunken Boxing" and dutifully teaches Mr Chan, after he is helped by him. Jackie's love of Buster Keaton action slapstick, combined with the almost superhuman acrobat skills he acquired with the Peking Opera from a young age, blend masterfully, and the movie has plenty of humour as well as action. The fight scenes and stunts, are superbly executed (as usual)and the arduos training regime Jackie must endure, is both comical and revealing. Like so many Kung Fu style pictures of the era, this film sufferes terribly from bad dubbing, and is actually better watched in it's original form with subtitles. At 10 mins short of 2 hours is not that lean, but bounces along from scene to scene without making you worry too much. 16 years before the more widely known Legend of Drunken Master in 1994, this is still a great comic/action martial arts flick, and although it may not be as polished as his more recent work, the raw energy and exuberence of a more youthful Mr Chan, make this a must for fans and collectors alike. Enjoy!

As others have already said, sequel territory is often littered with pitfalls, but considering the pedigree of Robert Ludlum's story (and that fact that he was executive producer) this is a very polished part II. Picking up immediately after the equally good Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) returns after his self imposed exile in Goa is compromised. Implicated in a frame up, his previous employers now not only realise he is still alive, but at also large and suspect him of derailing a CIA exchange that goes awry. Filmed almost exclusively in Europe the action centers around Berlin & Moscow, and has some very impressive chase sequences and stuntwork. Damon continues to piece together his amnesia starved past, whilst trying to clear his name, and thwart the bad guys in a very fast paced cat and mouse thriller. A good supporting cast add credibilty to the story, and aside from some very choppy camera work in some action scenes, this movie is a gem. Puritans will complain about the sidestepping from the novels in places, but overall I feel this one of the top picks of the Summer releases. Enjoy

This movie is now 10 years old, and being discovered by a whole new audience, but the story and plot are essentially timeless. A good subtitle to this movie could have been &quot;Good Guys Finish Last&quot; as we follow the spiral of ultimate self destruction Michael Douglas embarks on to it's climatic, if reasonably predictable conclusion. The plot is quite simple, a middle class hard working, respectable man with no hint of a criminal past, or even propensity for violent or abnormal behavour is gradually pushed, up to and over the edge of his personal tolerance level. What results is him crashing down on the other side, and taking casualties with him as he &quot;falls down&quot;. I find it inconceivable to think that most of us will not be able to relate to at least some of the burdens that befall him, and this is the real power of the film. After losing his job (due to policy and cutbacks), an acrimonous divorce, and a general crummy hand he has been dealt he begins to act upon every tiny thing that has and does frustrates him (as many things frustrate us all) as he journeys through the movie, with devastating results. I don't know if there is a message in the film, but it is certainly compelling, and often gripping. Robert Duvall puts in a terrific performance as a veteran cop with one day to retirement who begins to piece together the unlikely string of events, in a powerful subplot which runs in tandem with the exploits of Douglas, until the two cross paths toward the end of the picture. Gritty, often graphic, and very powerful - this movie will live with you a long time after you have viewed it, for many reasons (most I which I don't have time to list here). If you haven't seen this movie yet, do so - I cannot recommend it enough.

So Batman is back? and this time "The Dark Knight", has more shadow, more danger, is more menacing etc etc?One can be forgiven for asking these things amidst the morass of versions of the popular comic book hero over the years, but particularly since Tim Burton's visionary remake back in 1989 with Michael Keaton, and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.Now unless you've been living in a cave somewhere, you will no doubt have caught some of the hype surrounding the movie, particularly Heath Ledger's performance as the psychotic perennial smile wearing criminal, so bittersweet after his untimely death.Chris Nolan makes a valiant effort here in his follow up to Batman Begins staying with the same characters, building on them, and continuing the "darker" side of Bruce Wayne's crime fighting alter ego. With the exception of a few, the same actors also reprise their roles from the last picture, with the main exception of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, who is easily as beguiling as Katie Holmes last time in the same role.The movie is fast paced, with some necessary pauses for dramatic buildup but moves fairly steadily over the almost 2 hour run time, the gadgets get a little better but still remain vaguely believable as do Batman's abilities, in fact this time we actually see a few chinks in the armor.The support cast are excellent, particularly Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, and Bale is suitably beefed but suave and almost arrogant as our hero. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two Face is a nice distraction, but his place in the movie could arguably been trimmed or even sidelined for the next movie, and ultimately makes this picture unnecessarily overfilled with diverging storylines.But make no mistake, the movie belongs to Ledger, and at times it seems that every one else is simply along for the ride. Within the storyline you find yourself suspending disbelief quite readily as The Joker goes on his one man demolition job, without conscience or care, bringing a real edge to his characters deviant sociopathy.It's difficult not to compare Nicholson and Ledgers performances side by side, but on close scrutiny where the former had some of the quirky likeability and almost lovable psychosis (reminiscent even of Cesar Romero in the camp TV show), Ledger is firmly grounded and oozes malevolence, when you laugh, it's usually nervous laughter as the character is dangerously unpredictable.On the positive side the movie has plenty of action, good CGI and bone crunching fight scenes and gadgets, which should please the most ardent fan of the movie genre. It also has enough depth to keep the more discerning viewers interest.On the negative, too long, and I mean TOO long, nothing would have been lost had this movie been shaved by at least 25 minutes, and even moved to the next movie (for which I hear Bale is contracted to make). Testament to this is the fact that as the viewer you expect to have seen the end credits roll, on at least 4 occasions before they actually do. Also as mentioned earlier Nolan has tried to cram too many plotlines and individual character embellishments together and it gets a bit messy.Those minor complaints aside, this IS a good movie, and worth seeing for Ledgers performance alone, a powerhouse performance of character acting that will I'm sure be a strong, but strange epitaph to a tragic loss of talent.

OK, let's get serious - 4 stars is a little generous, but this movie was EXACTLY what I expected, ridiculous, CGI stained, wispy plot, and GREAT FUN!!!. A PG13 rating precluded the usual gore fest that was associated with the previous Alien & Predator movies, and that will probably be this films biggest asset as a draw at the box office. Brief synopsis - Rich industrialist discovers mystic pyramid 2000 feet below Antarctica, assembles top notch team of experts to help unveil his prize, they all get caught up in a "every 100 year" traditional hunt of Aliens, deliberately cultivated to test visiting Predator warriors. Not much else to say really, if you can't see what's coming next in this movie you're in the wrong movie!. Pretty good performances, one or two scary moments, tastefully edited CGI and a very pleasing fun filled 2 hours of nonsense. Enjoy!!

After almost falling over mountains of &quot;rave&quot; reviews for this move, including the High Impact &quot;Over 80 4 Star Reviews&quot; on the DVD sleeve, I was more than a little disappointed with this movie. An Oscar nod for Sofia Copola had also led me to believe that this would be something special, but even as a fan of Bill Murray I find it hard to recommend. A very slow beginning finds Bill Murray out of his depth in Tokyo as a flagging actor promoting a brand of whiskey. Anyone who has ever been to Tokyo will know it is NOT a very visitor friendly place, from the point of view of little, or no maps, tourist information, direction signs, assistance, or even menu's printed in English (or any other language except Japanese for that matter) and Ms Copola tries hard to portray this, and the quirky Japanese culture on screen at every given moment. Sadly though, this, and the gentle, if unlikely romantic chemistry between this lost actor in a failing marriage, and young newlywed unsure of her decision or life in general, that could be full of hilarious nuances just doesn't come across. I found myself skipping forward just to see if ANYTHING was going to happen, but was left feeling like a waste of just over 1hr 40 mins. I'm sorry to be arguing with so many critics praising this as a GREAT MOVIE, but perhaps like the title says, the comedy, story and enjoyment, was a least for me - Lost in the Translation.

Clint Eastwood rarely stars in a bad movie, but that's not to say this is bad, it just falls a bit flat. A good cast, including a deliciously villainous Robert Duvall unfortunately fail to lift this picture above mediocrity. Add to this, it's relatively short running time (just under 90 minutes), fans of the genre, and Clint (who have been spoiled by great movies before) will feel a little let down. It's probably fair to say that a lesser known cast, and director wouldn't even have got this movie off the cutting room floor. All this said, any Clint collector will probably want it in his/her collection, and the usual amount of dry humor, and Eastwoodesque rationality does make this watchable, if not that memorable.

This is actually a pretty good movie (as recent Anime movies go) and I certainly enjoyed it more than Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within, on which there are several comparative parallels.The animation and CGI are quite simply amazing, and whereas this may be enough to hold the attention of the intended target audience demographic, the plot was thin at best and meandered more than I would like.The synopsis is fairly straight forward (and not disimilar from other movies of the genre) where a female agent "Vexville" of the title is an sent to Tokyo to investigate illegal robot development banned by the UN of the day, needless to say this is set in a futuristic world.There are some good action moments and the slant is more toward the horror style of Anime flicks in a "World going bad" scenario not unlike the recent live action Resident Evil series of movies.Another annoyance was the soundtrack. Despite the pedigree of Paul Oakenfold, it seems to have been added as an afterthought to the editing, and throughout most of the picture (as good as it is) doesn't seem to fit well with what's on screen.I rated it at 3 stars which me seem unduly harsh as it is entertaining in itself and certainly a polished production. It was also nice to see an Anime movie where one doesn't require a ton of information and backstory (or the need to see three prequels) to understand what's going on. I just wanted more depth to the characters and story, something that seems to be missing in most movies like this.

Denzel Washington is pretty good in this remake of the Sinatra thriller brought up to date for a modern audience. Here playing Ben Marco, a captain (and now Major) in the US Army whose tactical unit were saved from being wiped out, by Sgt Raymond Shaw (Liev Shreiber) single handedly in Kuwait before Desert Storm, or so it would seem. Sounds straight forward, but the only problem is that Marco's unit have all since disappeared or suffered an untimely demise, and this accompanied with his strange dreams and flashbacks have led him on a one man mission to find the truth. The erstwhile saviour and hero Shaw, now riding on his heroic exploits is proudly sporting his medal of honour, and steered with political avarice by his State Senator mother (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep) is in the running to be the next Vice President. As the story unfolds we see a connection between Shaw, his mother and "Manchurian Global" a huge conglomerate simply reeking of political back dealing, corruption and outlawed scientific experiments in mind control, as Marco starts to fit the pieces of the jigsaw together. I'm not going to give the story away, because the movie actually does that on it's own about half way in, and tries but never really delivers on the suspense or credibility front, rather bumbling with a tepid predictability instead. Comparing this to the original (for those who have seen it) is interesting for the similarities. Both movies paint their villians well as almost insidious and faceless power figures, or puppet masters working behind the scenes, and ultimately wielding all the power, and if one had too choose, this version is probably more believable on paper. In the Sinatra movie it was of course the Communist Red Chinese (it was 1962 after all) and now it's a comparitive of virtually any modern powerful conglomerate. The movie was OK, but really had way too many improbable scenes for me. Another question I kept asking was why the villians were even tolerating the existence of Washingtons character in the first place, when he could have easily been made to "disappear" once he had begun to air the can of worms he had opened. Jon Voight has a nice Cameo as Senator Thomas Jordan who helps Marco, and one or two red herrings and twists help the picture hold your attention. All that said, 129 minutes is a bit long, and the constant flashbacks, and fade to black camera shots get a little tiresome. Washington is believably engaging as the paranoid shell shocked Major, and Schreiber also works hard to lift the film, but this is not something that will appear too near the top of either ones Resume I suspect. DVD extra's are standard, plus a featurette and commentary section. Unless you're a collecting fan renting is probably best advice. Enjoy

Lest we forget..........Something I say quite often to the younger generations today about our history, World history, engineering achievements that changed the World, amazing entrepenuers and free thinkers, genius men and women, and visionaries.Even with the limitless information online and amazing multimedia available however, history remains pretty "boring" for todays "I want it now", youtube, guitar hero generation.Les Standiford makes it better, easier, and enjoyable.With an impressive list of acclaimed publications to his credit, he is a novelist in the truest sense. I'm quite happy to wade through encyclopedia's and online and read with interest about Henry Morrison Flagler, and what was coinsidered the "8th Wonder of the World" the railway that joined the Florida Keys to the Mainland, but it is intensive and laborious if you have no love of history.The story here is light and vibrant, almost punchy in it's narrative as you learn about the man who conquered nature, only to be KO'd on the return match, when a Hurricane heavily damaged and partially destroyed the line in 1935. Interestingly 5 hurricanes threatened to halt production completely during the 7 year construction, but the first train arrived on time at Key West on January 22nd 1912.The story reads a little like a "ripping yarn" and you'll enjoy it so much you forgot that the things you are reading about actually happened.5 stars, and a well done for making history fun!

The original cast return for an unecessary sequel of the much funnier original nine yards movie, and work hard to lift this picture above forgettable. Bruce Willis is now an apron sporting homemaker getting in touch with his feminine side and hiding in Mexico with his new hitman wife Jill (Amanda Peet). Oz (Perry) is living the high life in LA with his new wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge) still in dentistry but with a small arms factory in his lavish home. All appears well until Lazlo Gogalak (Pollack) emerges from prison and comes after them for murdering his son (also played by Pollack) in the first movie. What was a reasonable idea suffers badly from "Sequelitis" and comes across as little more than reworking old ideas. There are some funny moments, and the 98 minute run time moves quickly enough, without requiring to much concentration, but this picture is quickly forgotten. Everything seems to be overdone to try and squeeze cheap laughs, from Pollacks poor command of English, to Willis's apparent erectile dysfunction, and Perrys paranoia and confusion. All obviously ends well for our loving quartet, but the lack of any real surprises, and a very weak script don't help the end result. OK movie, but nowhere near as good as the first, and rent before buying is a must. The DVD also has non existent extras (unless you include one trailer and director commentary) adding to the whole feel that this package was a money driven exploit flick devoid of depth or intelligence.

I always felt this movie was ahead of it's time, and it's a fairly faithful interpretation of the excellent Jack Higgins novel of the same name. Michael Caine plays Col Steiner, a specialist and decorated leader of an elite paratrooper force, recruited by Col Radl (Robert Duvall) on a top secret mission to kidnap Winston Churchill. As hair brained as the scheme appears, Caine and his team appear to have a reasonable chance at success as the movie builds, and the storyline moves nicely with a tension and drama that is often gripping. There is some interesting social comment going on here as well with regard to the portrayal of Caine and his men, in so far as they were brave and honorable, and for the most part following orders, without subscribing to politics. In 1976 Germany was still trying to shrug off it's past and having spent some time there, I know you really didn't have to look far to find members of the now older generation, who were outrightly opposed to the Nazi regime. This side of Caines character (that infuriates his superiors) cleverly puts you the audience almost on his side, and like the more recent, and excellent Movie "Das Boot", you watch, and realise that soldiers were soldiers during this awful conflict, regardless of uniform color, driven more often by patriotism, than fanatiscism. Donald Sutherland is excellent as Devlin, a German / Irish spy sent ahead to the small English village with the help of some local collaboration, to pave the way for Caine and his men. Larry Hagman is intentionally laughably inadeqaute as the Officer in charge of the local American detachment on guard, who seem to be no match for Caines elite band. There are a few twists and turns, and the action flicks between the mission in England, and Duvall's angst in France, knowing he takes the glory OR the blame depending on how the events turn out. This is an excellent war movie, with solid acting, an airtight script and clever direction. Yet another release that drifted away into obscurity after failing to please at the box office, it's a welcome DVD release, and superb entertainment. Enjoy.

There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only

Dirk Pitt. Adventure has a new name? - so reads the tagline, and to be honest it's about time something new came along to replace the likes of Indiana Jones, and James Bond (against whom it is difficult not to draw comparisons). Matthew McConaughy is suitably charming and buffed as the handsome adventurer / treasure hunter alongside Steve Zahn's able but bewildered sidekick Al, in this global trek to find a phantom Iron Clad ship from the civil war that has somehow ended up in Africa. This obssession of Pitt's of course enrages his sponsor and employer Admiral Sandecker (superb casting William H Macy)who outwardly only tolerates his best asset but cares with a veiled admiration. The crew happen to be in Africa of course on another salvage operation, when they get a whiff of the Iron Clads possible location, but things take a turn however, when they must intervene to save Dr Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) who is on the run from the local warring factions after discovering illegal toxic dumping. The threeway escapade takes off with plenty of high jinks, action and adventure in a wholesome but believable way which is both refreshing and entertaining. Clive Cusslers novel may not have been represented to the satisfaction of the puritan fans, but the sober undertones of the story and one or two serious moments, do much to help keep this light romp on the ground. More than a buddy movie (although many cliches are apparent) this is a good contemporary story, and McConnaughy represents an ideal Action Icon for a modern audience. The reasonable success of the picture will undoubtedly pave the way for a myriad of sequels, but for now sit down, grab the popcorn and enjoy some old fashioned action and fun brought bang up to date. Enjoy

Nicolas Cage,(Cameron Poe) - fresh from deep south elocution lessons drawls out as he watches a Classic Corvette being towed behind an airplane several hundred feet up. Cage plays the nice guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, and goes to prison after inadvertently killing someone harrassing his wife in a brawl. The judge decides that Cage, as an ex Ranger should know better than to use his considerable fighting skills on worthless drunks and sends him away. During his prison term his daughter is born, whom he refuses to let visit, but collects ALL of her pictures and letters whilst incarcerated. He also beefs up, grows his hair long, and acquires a stack of white vests, to help show off his physique. Remember what I said about wrong place wrong time? well sure enough, after getting parole he is being transported on a prison aircraft for a ride home, when the plane is seized (through a planned and elaborate hijack) by the other inmates, among them John Malkovich as the criminally revered Cyrus "the Virus" Grissom. Of course, the plane is packed with the worst criminals imaginable (including a darkley comic cameo from Steve Buscemi) from across the whole country, we assume all going to some maximum security country club somewhere. I don't want to be harsh about this pure escapist way way over the top action, but it's a lot of fun, and feasible (if highly unlikely) for the most part. John Cusack is excellent as the "sensible" US Marshal on the ground, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek TNG) plays his complete opposite "lets kill em all" DEA Agent, trying to get the plane and cargo back. There's enough explosions, chases, and fights to keep most fans of this sort of thing happy for weeks, and the acting is actually very good and believable all round. The main problems are the Director seemingly not knowing when to end the movie (after several finale opportunities), and a lack of any real depth or character development (but then consider the type of movie for a second). The "never leave a man behind" code that Cage's character constantly bombards the audience with is also a little too cliched for my taste, but all that said, it IS a good picture. Predictable? Yes - but well worth the viewing, and the DVD polish adds a little. Enjoy.

Oh dear, oh dear. Yet another &quot;straight to video&quot; release from Steven Seagal who this times plays a former government agent on the edge of retirement (yes I know you're shocked). He just happens to be in Thailand visiting his niece or granddaughter or whatever when she is kidnapped by some local ruffians. The CIA are on the case but this is simply &quot;not good enough&quot; for Mr. Seagal, who after all trained all of their fathers anyway, and he sets off on a one man mission of justice to sort everyone out, and of course save the girl. The usual mindless and implausible &quot;action&quot; ensues, interspersed with plenty of opportunity for Seagal to change into black clothing and perfect his &quot;hard stare&quot;, which is now his preferred weapon, (when not crunching bones that is). As enjoyable as missing the last train home, I ask Mr. Seagal again - &quot;when are you going to retire?&quot;

I missed the cinematic release of this movie, and really rushed to view it on DVD when released, after seeing the trailers. Sadly for me the concept of the film and script seemed to part company after about a third of the way in, and began to point toward an all too predictable ending. DeNiro plays a street wise, tough respected cop of many years, who reflects with melancholy on the demise of his childhood vacations, and home life in the title location, now turned into a run down haven for drug addicts, bums and criminals. A long standing divorce and estranged son, add to his already overburdened lack of inner peace along with the revelations of his fathers criminal past, played in flashback sequences. The movie revolves around these attempted sub plots, and his lack of knowledge about his sons fall from high school football hero to petty thief and drug addict. The two inevitably cross paths when the son is accused of a murder, and the investigation falls under the auspices of DeNiro and his long time partner. DeNiro must then juggle his loyalties whilst upholding his beliefs, and attempt to seek the truth at all costs. Sound's great, doesn't it? - well I thought so too, until about half way into the picture, when I found myself really not caring about it all, and just watching for the sake of it. Like so many great actors, DeNiro really should find solid material these days, instead of just churning out "formula" like this, Not an awful movie by any means, but rent before you buy!

I was interested to read another viewers comments about Helen Hunts character in this movie, being interested in Tornadoes, because she witnessed her father being sucked away by one as a child. This is the biggest flaw in this otherwise fairly good escapist flick. I wonder why the Hollywood moguls think we have to have these back stories and then a dreary romance effort, in the midst of carnage, much like the more recent Day After Tomorrow. Was every weatherman inspired by a lightning bolt that killed his dog? Are Lumberjacks so inspired because a tree fell on their brother? the list of possibilities is endless. This could have, and SHOULD have been a great movie. The script and story in general aren't bad, and the special effects are of course impressive. This is a movie remember, so those who want to be disparaging about the lack of similarities to "real" storm chasers should wake up. I for one don't want to see a movie about someone sitting in a field all day waiting for weather. That said, the movies penchant for trying to walk a middle line here (not quite disaster movie, not quite love drama) leaves BOTH areas unfulfilled. Will Helen Hunt get back with Bill Paxton? will his new fiance run away? Will they beat the much better equipped and funded competition to the punch? Will they find a "Finger 5" tornado? - Frankly I stopped caring. I wanted to see a movie about a Twister, and although I was expecting something predictable, this was just too much, and that's a real shame. Getting a DVD makeover means of course clearer picture and sound, and those with a 5:1 system at home will doubtless get a lot from the reproduction here. trouble is however, it won't matter how you watch it, it's still a let down - I wanted to give more but 3 Stars is a stretch, and that's mainly for the CGI.

OK, so 5 stars is more than generous, but I was surprised how well this movie was received stateside when it was released. Being English myself, I thought a lot of the comedy and dialogue might not translate well to a mainstream audience, but you can't beat a good old fashioned story. Simple plot - A World famous rock band of the 70's split acrimoniously, and through a chance meeting with the son of a former promoter have the chance to get back together. A veritable A list of UK TV stars are here, and the team of Ian La Frenais & Dick Clement (Lovejoy, Auf Wiedersehn Pet) writing ensure quality. Billed as a riotous comedy is a bit wide of the mark, as there is a great deal of depth to the story, and the characters. At times hilarious, often bittersweet, but always realistic in it's portrayal of life, love, missed opportunities, and a wanting to relive ones past - this is really polished. As someone who can remember the 70's this struck a chord or two with me, and I would doubt it would have as good an impact on a younger audience, but don't let that put anyone off - a real "feel good" picture, cleverly interwoven with a quiet grace, and melencholy air would be the poets description. Plenty of repeat viewability, and Full screen & Wide screen on the same double sided disc make this a bargain. Great fun, Enjoy!

The first 20 minutes of this movie had me falling off the edge of my seat, and did not let up. A very young, and relatively unknown cast brings to life what can only be seen as an inventive and very scary screenplay. Without giving too much content away, it deals with the premise that one's time to die if accidentally missed will catch up with you, and deals with a young group of friends - one of whom has premonitions about fateful events. Gripping, absorbing with more twists than a good roller coaster, you will not be able to stop watching until the end credits. A Great Movie

Another little known sword and battle picture, gets the DVD makeover and will no doubt ride in on the shirt tails of new releases like Troy. Don't be put off however, this is a very good and polished piece of filmaking, which deals (quite graphically for the year of production) with the savage and often futile 30 years War that raged across 17th Century Europe. This is not a typical story though, and interestingly deals with an uncomfortable but workable peace pact between, Michael Caine as the warring Captain (and mercenary army) and Omar Sharif as a local peasant. As this wafer thin respite gradually succumbs to the vagaries of the marauding soldiers, the story kicks up a notch with some good action sequences and thought provoking scenarios. Caine is superb throughout, and is something of an island of drama amidst what would otherwise be a plodding script, despite the pedigree of writer James Clavell (of Shogun fame). Overall a good solid war style movies that is more than a little different. Enjoy

I didn't get to see this movie at Christmas which may have made the viewing that bit more special, but I was not disappointed at waiting. A veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of well known stars grace a collection of short stories, in funny, romantic, sad, and heartwarming scenarios, and the end result, though a bit muddled is cleverly handled. A real testament to the success of this movie after it's release was how well it was received here in the States, for being a fairly formula laden Richard Curtis written &amp; directed production. Some of the stories do stretch the boundaries of credulity a little, but the flavor of the Christmas magic allows even the most cynical viewers to be forgiving. The performances are ALL great, as seemingly the entire range of human emotions are played out before you in each individual tale, culminating in a clever, and touching set of finales. Some of the language will make this unsuitable for younger viewers, but good family viewing overall. Often very touching but never sickly sweet, this is a great DVD buy, and will be surely pulled out every holiday season, along with the host of other well known seasonal regulars. Enjoy

Zulu is a timeless piece of cinema, a breathtaking, action packed spectacle based on a true story that has been receiving positive reviews, for years.To this end, and the fact that the movie stands on it's own merits, it is in no need of further praise as a movie, so my review will specifically talk about the Blu Ray version, and the sound and picture quality.IMPORTANT NOTE - This disc is region 0 and will play on ANY Blu-ray machines ANYWHERE. Is is however PAL format and will require a compatible TV (most modern TV's can do both NTSC and PAL)Many movies transferred onto Blu-Ray look good, often better than the original DVD release, which one would expect.Not unlike last years James Bond re released frame by frame restored movies, Zulu on Blu-Ray is one of the best transfers I have ever seen (and I watch a lot of movies).The rich colors and clarity of detail are awesome, but the picture shows incredible depth as well.Compared to the MGM regular DVD release it is framed at 2.25:1 and has some signs of slight cropping at the very edges, aside from this there are no real differences, except the that the improvements are immense.Consider for a moment that this picture is over 45 years old, blink, look away and then look again.For those who like numbers the feature takes up around 35GB of the used 40GB space.The bitrate is 35.1, which is almost 5 times that of the MGM DVD region 1 release.Sound is crisp and clean but only 2.0 due to the original soundtrack being transferred across.Commentary, two featurettes, and a couple of trailers round out the extra'sIf you have seen the vastly inferior (by comparison)Zulu Dawnplease don't be tempted NOT to buy or rent this movie - it is a great picture on many levels.If you just want to see one of the best examples of a movie on Blu-Ray currently available, buy it anyway.5 stars.

"Willing suspension of disbelief" is what you must tell yourself, before and especially during the first 20 mins or so of this movie. This is the dark side of Marvel comics characters, a sort of nasty Doberman they keep out of sight when friends are visiting, but want to have around for less welcome characters. Thomas Jane (probably best remembered as the brooding shark wrangler in Deep Blue Sea) does a pretty good job portraying what is probably one of the most difficult and grounded Marvel hero's (I use the term loosely). He is first and foremost a victim, turned vigilante, bringing restitution to those who have escaped the law. The twisted morality card is played LARGE here, as Travolta heads up a pretty vicious organized crime mob, who murder the entire family of our hero, during a family reunion. A few more sadistic scenes reinforce in the viewer the need for these baddies to die summarily, and horribly where possible, as they have worn out any votes of sympathy with the audience. Overall, it's a very dark, at times extremely violent, but enjoyable drama. Yes, I said drama, and that point is probably the paradoxical weakness of the movie. He's a man, he bleeds, he can die, he has no cape, and he certainly can't fly. However, he can survive severe beatings, bullet wounds, stabbing, fire and explosions, and still bounce back with a grimace, and his own small arms factory (remember what I said about suspension of disbelief). If I had to make a criticism, it would be that paradox - the very shaky walking between two genres, that almost, but not quite comes off. On the one hand, this is an adult themed violent revenge movie with attitude, on the other it's a Marvel character romp complete with unlikely characters, and some very misplaced dialogue. Jane looks the part at least, and spends most of the movie sulking inside a whisky bottle, when he's not killing villians which actually makes you feel for his character more than you would expect. Not too many surprises, but good CGI, good support cast, great stuntwork, and tight script make this 3.5, but not quite 4 stars. DVD has 4 featurettes that are well worth a look, as well as usual deleted scenes, commentary and trailers etc. Enjoy!

Before the opening titles are even finished, accompanied by the excellent and haunting musical score by Vangelis, the viewer feels almost swept back in time. This is the fairly simple (and based on true) story of Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charelson) and their exploits before and during the 1924 Olympic games. The two main characters could not be more different in that Abrahams runs for himself, and greater glory, and to prove his worth in a society that accepts, but eschews his Jewish heritage. The other is a missionarys son who believes God has made him fast for a purpose, and runs to please and honor the almighty. Both have their respective faith, and nerves tested to the limits, often to the detriment of those close to them, but the movie cleverly stays away from pretentious social comment, or philosophical undertones. Producer David Putnam, Writer Colin Welland, and Director Hugh Hudson evoke a time of gentlemen, fair play, decorum and esprit de corps that stays with you long after the end titles roll. There are some excellent supporting roles from a host of well knowns, including Ian Holm, Nigel Havers, and Alice Krige and the film reminds us of a far better and simpler time in the world of sports almost. Deserving of the 4 Oscars bestowed upon it back in 1981 (as a surprise winner)this new widescreen release to a polished DVD format with Dolby sound is a long wait finally over. There are lots of extra's to enjoy on the second disc, making the all round package more than worth the money. Often regarded as the quintessential "British" movie, it certainly has that flavor but is much more, and should appeal to anyone with a love of true drama. Undoubtedly 5 stars. Enjoy

Even more "beefed" than usual here, Arnie leads a bunch of elite Mercenaries on a rescue mission, into deep Jungle terrain, somewhere in South America. Trouble is, this is actually a ruse by former teammate Carl Weathers, to do some shameless weeding of gun runners south of the border, and the "honorable mercenary" Arnie is justifiably miffed for getting duped. More trouble is that the preceeding team of Soldiers were inexplicably wiped out and skinned by what we soon to discover is a very formidable (and not human) opponent. The action turns here into an escape movie, as Arnie and his team try to make there way to safety, and are hunted by the alien "Predator" of the title. The action is thick & fast, the special effects visceral, and the language more than colorful. This is a macho romp sure, but a good one - regardless of how over the top the characters are made out to be, the acting performances are spot on. Best of all is that this was a "scary" movie, that had you on the edge of your seat, and was gory and frightening to boot. Perhaps it is a sign of the times, that even with the advances in CGI, if this were made today, it would be a watered down version carrying a PG tag, attempting to make more money by reaching a wider audience(like this years Alien vs Predator). Maybe I'm wrong, but this is a horror film folks, should anybody under 17 be watching anyway??. The DVD itself is a let down, and looks like it should be in a cardboard sleeve in a dollar store - that's a real shame. If you want to see Arnie at his bone crunching and predictable best - this is it - Great Movie. Enjoy

I have to say honestly, that this is the biggest pile of crap I have watched in a long time. There, I said it, sorry to be so blunt, but I can't be nice about this.The connection to the story of the "Scorpion King" is about as tenuous as the directors grip on this movie.I don't mind sword and sorcery hokum, even the low budget variety, but I ended up feeling sorry for the actors in this one.We have all the standard makings of a franchise follow up.Hero - checkBabe - checkGeek - checkBad guy - checkAdd the stock additional characters to add supposed depth, but there chiefly to die in some grisly fashion, some tricky situations, monsters, and a good dose of "dark magic" and you've about got it all.Oh, I almost forgot, the hero's father was killed by the Bad Guy, so was his brother, and probably his hamster, so revenge is foremost in his mind, most of the time.This is dire, the acting is awful, the special effects are very cheap and choppy, even the blue screen stuff looks bad.On a separate note, the Sword of Damocles (needed to kill the bad guy) the last time I checked wasn't left spinning in the Underworld, but hung from a single horse hair. Oh, and the minotaur lived in a Labyrinth, not a dungeon. Oh, and the underworld was ruled by Hades, not some seductive dark witch................I could go on, and onLike a mug I purchased the Blu Ray hoping for great things, and got stung (at least I picked it up cheap). Save your money folks, if you must see it, rent it.

Great fun here in gold rush fevered Nome sees John Wayne as his inimitable self playing (suprise suprise) himself aka Sam McCord the man's man in gold country. A gentle comic tale sees him return to Seattle and bring back a girl for his lovesick partner played superbly by Stewart Granger. He begins to regret this trip, and task after the initial maiden he is sent to fetch has unexpectantly married whilst Granger was away panning for Gold, and he must quickly find a replacement. Add in some claim jumpers, a romantic subplot, a greedy villian and the ever present sandpaper like comic tension between the main characters, and the end result is a real treat. With an excellent supporting cast, great scenery and nothing too serious to get excited about, this is quality family viewing. The location alone precludes the usual Wayne western formula, but the action and laughs come thick and fast. A great classic. Enjoy

This film was fairly heavily panned by the critics when it opened in September 2003 and I feel undeservedly so, for it is a highly watchable, if uninventive piece of cinema.Kate Beckinsale plays a Vampire whose job is to hunt and kill Lychens (Werewolves) the sworn enemy of her coven, and her kind. The film has a distinctly European feel, not only in the locations, but also direction but moves at a good pace, keeping the viewer awake and for the most part enthralled. A little heavy on the Matrix style fight sequences, with the usual ammunition flying in all directions, it is however, more than a reworked vampire tale of good vs evil, or eveil vs evil (whichever you take) - with a reasonably original storyline in what one has to say, is a highly competetive, and previously visited genre. Without giving too much away, the art direction is gothic but modern and the new Sfx meets old world macabre well, even if there aren't too many suprises along the way. A major plus is the non cliched and well defined beginning middle and end, and the very well handled &quot;human touch&quot; portrayed by the main characters in their fantasy roles. Highly enjoyable romp, with some nice extra's on the DVD, and certainly worth a second look.

I gave this movie 4 stars, but it probably deserves about 3.75. Tom Cruise is excellent as a brooding US Army captain who is an alcoholic constantly haunted by his past. He is offered a job to train the Emperor of Japan's army in (what was at that time)modern warfare and help him wipe out some local troublemakers in the form of the last band of Samurai's. Cruise gets captured and slowly comes to realize he's been on the wrong side in a journey of self recovery and honor. Very well acted all-round with some excellent action scenes. The director cleverly does not fall in to any typical clich&eacute;s, and the plot seems like a history channel biopic rather than an allegory. Some nice cameos from not least Billy Connolly, and a very moving and thought provoking movie. - Enjoy

Some 16 years before the Oscar laden and equally brilliant &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, this movie is seen by many as one of Clint Eastwoods finest movies, particularly in the Western genre. Playing the title role himself, we meet Josey Wales, a quiet farmer, abruptly thrown into the civil war after his land and family are attacked by Union soldiers, who joins up with the confederate fight in an almost guerilla / mercenary way. The civil War aspect of the story is little more than an opening skirmish however, as it is the subsequent fugitive aspect of the character that moves us through most of the picture. I have to disagree with those that think this is just a revenge movie, or that a single viewing is all one can manage, as the story unfolds in a multi faceted way with each succesive viewing, despite the viewer knowing the ending. Wales comes to be the guiding scout and protector to an unlikely and very mixed bag of characters (all played with sound realism)as he is continually and almost reluctantly hounded by his former ally Fletcher. Charged with hunting him down, Fletcher (played with a salty almost poetic grace by John Vernon) must accompany a band of &quot;red leg&quot; Union soldiers, with more than questionable morality, to the border and this long pursuit helps the picture move at an even pace. Add some interesting subplots, commancheros, some imaginative and lively characters (with many of Eastwoods regular screen stars in various roles)and the overall effect is just right, without trying to be moralistic. Often brutal in it's depiction of the &quot;wild&quot; west, and at times graphically violent keeps the deserved R rating, but some moments of comedy and pathos bring an unmistakable Eastwood handprint of direction, without overtaking the excellent story or script. Already widely received as a classic piece of filmaking, it has stood the test of time extremely well, and has become one of the movies that have benchmarked the genre since it's release almost thirty years ago. Extremely enjoyable movie.

Well deserving of the &quot;Classic Movie&quot; tag that so often accompanies it's reviews, this movie has John Wayne written all over it. Great direction, and an artful performance by Dean Martin as &quot;Dude&quot; the reforming alcoholic, along with a wonderful musical cameo by Ricky Nelson, help along a storyline which is essentially simple, and was mirrored some years later in the Howard Hawks film &quot;Eldorado&quot; (also starring Wayne). Chances are you've seen this movie on reruns several times, but a definitive commercial free copy like this is worthy of any home collection. Not just for die hard John Wayne fans, it has what movies always used too - A beginning, middle, and an end, even if the bad guys didn't always wear the black hats. An absorbing family western that stands up well to the test of time. Look out for a very early performance by Angie Dickenson as the romantic interest. Great Stuff.

Hard to believe that this movie is almost 25 years old, but it is still very funny, even if some of the topical gags miss the mark with a more up to date audience.The movie that seemingly spawned a multitude of imitations, and paved the way for comedies like Police Squad, Naked Gun, and many more, remains a timeless classic of the almost anarchic comedy genre.A totally implausible story strewn with punny lines, and shameless sideswiping of almost EVERY other disaster movie of the era finds, Robert Hayes, Julie Hagerty, and Leslie Nielsen (prior to his screen rebirth in a comic capacity) aboard flight 209 to Chicago, encumbered with just about every possible disaster from food poisoning to strung out air traffic controllers, they must somehow save the plane and passengers. Subplots a plenty ensue and look out for brilliant cameos from Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack playing such ridiculous characters with deadpan sincerity, it's all enough to make you laugh out loud. The sight gags come thick and fast and you will find yourself watching this movie over and over and seeing things you have missed in previous viewings, from the sublime to the ridiculous. Rightfully named in a recent poll of top comedy movies, this is perhaps one of the best offerings from the Abrahams / Zucker / Zucker team, who arguably peeked with this movie, albeit one of their first. Some minor references to drugs and some visual innuendo which is probably tame by today's standards, gave this a PG rather than general audience certificate, but there isn't too much to get offended about. You'll be too busy laughing anyway! Enjoy.

UPDATE - NOVEMBER 2011It's easy to start running out of superlatives quickly, on the quality of this Blu-Ray Transfer of the 1956 classic; I doubt it ever looked better.According to Ron Smith, (the man at Paramount who was in charge of the restoration project), the original VistaVision negative was scanned at high resolution, giving an image basically 6000 pixels 4000 pixels, so you've got a rather large file with each and every shot, each and every frame.The scanner then literally takes a photograph of each frame in the film as it goes by and turns it into data. That data is cleaned up by an army of technicians, before color restoration work by Smith and Yan Yarbrough, from Warner Brothers Motion Picture Imaging completes the process.When you consider the running time of 231 minutes, you start to realize what a mammoth task this was, in fact Smith himself admitted that he hadn't done a lot of photochemical or even digital work since he started working on it in '96-'97,No hi def restoration on older films, even on more contemporary classics like the original Star Wars, and Star Trek flicks, is without a down side though.Crystal clarity often exposes the special effects quite clearly. Effects I might add that might have been cutting edge in their day and in the case of the Ten Commandments even award winning get a transparency in the wash. Myself, I think this adds to the style of the picture, but some of the more obvious overlaid shots, and super imposing on stock footage, or backdrops can look cheesy.All that said, this a masterpiece - not just the movie (which I originally reviewed on DVD - see below) but the rich colors, crisp AC-3, Dolby, DTS Surround Sound, and full production complete with Overture, Introduction by De Mille himself, and original Intermission.The movie runs over two Blu-Ray discs with just the main feature, but also has some worthwhile extras.If you've seen it, like it and want to know whether it's worth shelling out the extra few bucks to get this fully restored high def feast, I highly recommend you don't give it a second thought.I guarantee you won't believe your eyes............5 StarsMy original review of the movie:They don't make them like this anymore.........and some might say, good job they don't. But with this movie they would be wrong. This is an epic movie in all senses of the word, De Milles "cast of thousand" means extra's by the train load, lavish painted sets, and one of, if not THE classic story. Add the class of Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter & Edward G Robinson (to name but a few) and a watertight script, and this is one polished piece of cinema. Long before CGI, but the special effects are still pretty good, the cinematics sweeping, but the real power of the movie lies in Charlton Hestons powerhouse performance. Back when hero's looked the part, maybe not buffed like Brad Pitt in "Troy" but camera down around the knees, and bellowing out quasi prose in a booming baratone, really portrayed the characters with panache. This is a fairly long movie and covers the story from the Bull Rushes to the delivery across the Jordan, and most things in between during the 220 mins run time. Yul Brynner is also suberb as Rameses the Egyptian tyrant, and the whole production is on such a massive scale, it's a visual feast on the small screen. The transition to DVD is pretty good with Dolby sound and a few other extra's on the two disc set. Considering the year of production, this stacks up well and is probably considered the benchmark in sword and sandal style biblical epics. One for the collectors library. Enjoy!

Although this is by no means a &quot;definitive&quot; collection it is a good introduction to those who may be new to Queens music, and a worthy addition to any existing fans home library. The chronological format demonstrates well the broad range of the bands talents, and their ability to grow and adapt to the music scene around them, coming back contantly into the charts for over 30 years. Gifted multi talented musicians in their own right, and long time friends, the flawless studio session reproduction is superb, the band who bragged about never using synthesizers (until the mid 80's when they had to give in)used a host of intruments and music styles throughout their long career, and after the tragic loss of Freddie Mercury in the 90's, consolidated their material, and added some new versions. The third disc is more eclectic, and although not personally my favorite has some good covers of the bands songs (with their participation) by other well known artists, as well as the excellent Under Pressue &amp; Barcelona, and almost painfully bittersweet These are the Days of Our Lives. At under $30 for a 51 track anthology this really is GREAT value, and a timeless collection that will continue to enthrall each subsequent generation of listeners.

One has to ask when Burt Reynolds is going to hang up his acting shoes, after seeing this, having seen better performances from him of late in the Vision Express commercials. This is TV movie material through and through, and promises much in the way of steamy sex, intrigue and betrayal (should you believe the trailer, and cover sleeve) but is actually little more than bland throughout. Reynolds plays a New Orleans millionaire (with questionable connections) whose young attractive wife (played in sultry fashion by Saffron Burrows) is a constant worry to him, on the grounds of what he sees as her eventual, and inevitable infidelity. Not wanting to wait for this to just happen he offers a young hunk $50,000 to seduce the aforementioned Ms Burrows to "test" her love for her husband. As the wafer thin plot lumbers on, we are treated to a somewhat gratuitous over the table seduction scene, which is then consolidated sometime later by a more "tender" but equally lame staircase episode. The upshot of all of this is that our young stud refuses to do the job for the money , but then finds himself falling for the married woman and can't help himself. This of course unleases the wrath of the now extremely ticked off Mr Reynolds (I mean what did he expect?) who then becomes ... bent on dishing out retribution to the pair of them. What should then have been well set up into a good thriller with the opportunity for several twists and turns, is predictable and the movie goes down from this point at about the same speed as the Titanic. This movie really tries to be a solid psychological thriller, with an adult theme but suffers badly from a weak script, thin storyline and fairly average performances. I kept asking myself, as I'm sure most viewers will WHAT would have happened if Reynolds had left "well enough alone" as his young wife doesn't really shout out for an affair, but that's a moot point I guess. It is not overly BAD, but it isn't that good either. I got the feeling that Reynolds was simply going through the motions to get a paycheck, and Ms Burrows was far more polished and believable in Deep Blue Sea. All this being said, there's a fair amount of material here to keep most people happy who enjoy 10pm movies on the Mystery channel, but don't get your hopes up too high.

Wow, Jason Statham finally made it!. That's what I felt after watching this hugely enjoyable action romp from director Corey Yueng who has collaborated with such as Luc Besson in the past in movies like "Red Dragon". This movie has a distinct European feel, not only in locations, but also direction, and one could be forgiven for thinking this was a Besson movie. This notwithstanding, it is a great roller coaster action flick, with some very well choreographed fight and action sequences. Mr Statham plays retired special forces hardman Frank Martin (why do they always retire so young?) living in the South of France who is a highly paid, feared and reveared professional courier, sporting a customized BMW, and formidable array of weapons (himself included). Regardless of the cargo, he conducts himself with consumate expertise, and deadly force where necessary, but is essentially a morally driven "good guy" who just happens to work as a mercenary. Quickly embroiled in a kidnapping, and attempted murder he stirs up a veritable hornets nest of villians who are not only armed to the teeth, but also ruthlessly led by a sadistic and equally die hard nemesis played by Matt Schulze. You can easily watch this movie over and over again for it's non stop action pace, and very slick direction, but the more discerning viewer, will want to leave the intellect behind, as this is pure adrenaline junky material. I would have given this movie 5 stars, but for a couple of reasons. Some of the fight sequences just cross the line a tad on believabilty (even in this genre of escapism) and the amazing ability of all character (Statham included) to endure taking the kind of punishment that would drop a Rhino, and still bouncing back like new. The only other moan would be the annoying habit it seems today, of multiple scenes and sequences that appear in the trailer, NOT being in the film! - if you check out the extended features on the DVD you'll see.If you can place your tongue squarely in your cheek for a couple of hours though, you will LOVE this movie.

I have to confess to finding this movie very difficult to review for a number of reasons, the main ones being the extremely implausible and silly plot, and some bad casting. I think people will either love or hate this movie, with little chance for middle ground, but whichever way you fall, you have to admire Writer/Director Kerry Conrans, vision and resolve in getting this (his first movie) onto the big screen. This is a loving homage to a bygone era of Biggles, Saturday morning heroes, 50's Sci Fi movies, and the Wizard of Oz. It is fantastical, tongue in cheek, inventive yet predictable but somehow it's just TOO much of a mixed bag for my taste. The complete blue screen CGI production gave Conran unlimited artistic licence, and the effects are impressive, even if they are almost a pastiche on old Sci Fi flicks, and serial cliffhangers. The trouble is that he has deliberately shown them as special effects, the sepia drenched resolution throughout, and not exactly seemless matching of live action with CGI is obviously on purpose in trying to emulate the back cloths, rockets on string, and dodgy effects of the aforementioned films, on which this is loosely based. If (and it's a sizeable IF) you can embrace this idea, you will love the movie, but the average viewer will probably be completely misled by the trailers, DVD sleeve, and advertising, and think EH?. It helps to understand that Conran spent 4 years at home on his own computer making 6 minutes of screen time of this mythical "World of Tomorrow" and that was enough to sell the production team and actors. That said, most of the talent is wasted with the exception of Jude Law as the sprightly gentleman "hero" of the title. Of course, the script was not exactly taxing, and the supporting cast have adapted the role well, but Gwyneth Paltrow trying to be a female Indiana Jones style intrepid reporter was simply a job of bad casting, or was it? - perhaps this too was designed to mirror the often wooden performances in old B movies?This is not a bad movie, but it's really not one thing or another, and came across as a bit of a mess I felt - It'll probably hold your attention until the last reel, but my advice would be rent before you buy. I often watch movies many times, but one viewing was about all I could take here.

Originally screened in six 45 minute episodes, this film charts the story of a typical German U-Boat crew during WWII. But even trimmed to video length, this is one of the best WWII films ever made - The cast, script, soundtrack, and sets are all outstanding, but the triumph of this picture is that regardless of nationality or allegiances, the narrative direction is impartial in it's delivery - depicting the horror and futility of war. Through victory, loss, pain and laughter you become drawn in to the characters of each one of the U-Boats crew, and the movie is uplifting as well as emotionally engaging. Without the graphic splendour of many later underwater films, this movie is an intense human drama that few who have watched, have failed to remember. Although also available in English language format, it is best when viewed in its original German language so DVD is the best choice here, giving lots of options, and extra information.

This for me was one of Jim Carreys best movies, who I feel has suffered in material choices since his explosion on the scene with The Mask back in 1994. Unlike the Mask however, the storyline here is not as cartoon like and actually deals with some real personal issues, most of us can identify with. Unhappy with his lack of success at work, and generally disatisfied with life, after more than his share of mishaps, Bruce (Carrey) takes to fist waving the almighty, and blaming him for all that is wrong in his life, and the World in general. God, played with laconic sobriety, and more than a little pathos by Morgan Freeman, decides to teach Bruce a lesson by giving him his own job for a few days, to see how he could improve on it, and the results are more than hilarious. The story doesn't however fall into any traps, and balances the humour with some clever, and often poignant lessons for our unlikely hero, along the way, leaving the viewer will a well rounded visual treat. Very few movies have me laughing out loud like this one, and although Jim Carreys brand of expression might not be to everyones taste, the supporting cast including the aforementioned Mr Freeman, and Jennifer Aniston add much to the scheme of things. Should appeal to a broad viewing audience, and even though it is fairly predictable from the outset, it is a highly watchable, and very very funny movie.

There have been a lot of great movies about incarceration, escape and people defying incredible odds to survive, and this excellent movie based upon true events and the book by Josef Martin Bauer rates among the best in my opinion.I have not (as yet) read the book, and understand that the movie takes some liberties with the story. At face value this was probably essential to add some distraction to what would have otherwise been probably a slow plodding story.This notwithstanding, I found the film to be tense, absorbing and emotional as you follow the character of Clemens Forell through his epic, and amazing journey.The story is essentially straightforward, an enlisted soldier in the German army bids his daughter and wife (expecting their unborn child) farewell at a train station toward the end of World War II, heading for (one assumes) the Russian front.The story moves quickly forward to his arrest and trial, and imprisonment and transfer by train to a Russian Gulag (along with many other German soldiers) for crimes against Mother Russia.He arrives at Cape Dezhnev on the far eastern peninsula of the Asian continent by the Bering Sea, a forced labor camp to mine lead for the Russians.If you want to get a flavor for his mammoth undertaking on foot, I urge you to map this location online.The first half of the movie deals with this, and the brutality and inhuman conditions he and his fellow soldiers face under the guard of the base commander Kamenev, who tells him to forget all chances of ever leaving this wintry hell.The second half of the movie deals with his escape, and 3 year 8,000 mile journey to try and reach Germany and home.It is at times a little slow, but visually stunning, and emotional charged and tense throughout.I read some reviews ask why the viewer should feel sorry for a German soldier after "What they did to others in the War" but would ask that you watch this, and see it for what it is. An enlisted man, taken from his family to fight for his country, perhaps blindly, but a million miles removed from the politics and atrocities of his superiors.He could have been wearing a uniform of any nation.Failing to feel for his plight and story for these reasons is a churlish take on humanity.Although you may know how the story ends, it is no worse in the telling, and although the film is in German with subtitles, the movie contains minimal dialogue, and relies on a visual depth of storytelling.Excellent performances all round, not least from Bernhard Bettermann as Forell, and Anatoliy Kotenyov as his relentless pursuer, this is a movie that shows the depth of the human spirit, and a love that drives a man to impossible ends.Release in on an unrated Region 1 DVD.A Blu-Ray release would be nice, currently this is only available in Europe and NOT this film, but the highly popular 376 minute 50's TV serialization seen on German TVTruly excellent movie. Highly recommended

This is a great idea for a movie, and much more than a "switchover" story, in which we meet two completely different individuals whose live become intertwined after a car accident. , but Affleck & Jackson are certainly not small names these days, and although I'm sure many people will disagree, do their best to pad out a pretty lame script, one has to say.This is a story of morals, and certainly trys to deliver a message, after one simple event forces each of the main characters to study, and ultimately reassess their lives. For me this movie however, fell a bit flat - I kept expecting something much more than I saw, and the ending seemed as if the Director had run out of ideas, and had to go with the "off the shelf" crowd pleaser finale. I wouldn't say that this movie was a waste of talent, or particularly bad. It's just true that a book cannot be judged by it's cover, anymore than a movie can be judged by it's cast. A struggle to get to 3 Stars.

Although the DVD release is still reasonably recent, this rough tough &quot;a man's gotta do&quot; action yarn is now looking a little dated. However, don't be too put off by the year of production, as despite the wispy plot, this is actually still a good movie that could arguably stack up to some of todays counterparts. This is the tale of Walker, Texas Ranger before he was turned into a pious, moralistic clean cut nice police officer, honed to housewife revered perfection for reruns on the Lifestyle and Hallmark channels. Gritty, tough and rough around the edges, the action comes fairly thick and fast, and the movie also has the necessary formula for the genre:1)The hero must be in law enforcement (of some kind)insubordinate, but always right, extremely tough and be able to take unbelievable amounts of physical beatings.2)The villian must have inexhaustible resources, a private army the size of Mexico City, and nefarious and vindictive motives.3)Anyone close to the hero must be kidnapped, beaten, killed, maimed or otherwise visited upon by the bad guys goons. (This must also include pets, partners, dry cleaners etc)4)The final showdown must be hand to hand combat to attempt to disguise the predictable ending, despite the availability of an arsenal the size of Fort Bragg.Having all of these characteristics (and more) in place, and like any good Norris/Seagal style movie, fans of this sort of stuff will find plenty to enjoy. This is NOT a bad movie by any means, and as long as can plant your sense of credibility on hold for a couple of hours, this will certainly liven up a rainy afternoon. Good supporting cast, and David Carradine gives an early glimpse of his more villainous qualities, he so well exuded in the more recent Kill Bill movies. Enjoy

Owen Wilson heads up a pretty amazing cast list here as Jack Ryan, the petty thief pretty boy in Hawaii, trying to hit big. Morgan Freeman, Charlie Sheen, Gary Sinise, Willy Nelson, Sara Foster and even Harry Dean Stanton......and the list goes on. Even the pedigree of Elmore Leonards novel and George Armitage in the directors chair (Grosse Pointe Blank) make you sit back after watching this and ask - What happened? This is a very dull movie that promises much, but fails to deliver on just about all levels. A who's scamming who? game unfolds that keeps you guessing, but fails to really grab your attention, and looks like everyone was just going through the motions for a paycheck. The visual distraction of Foster (virtually bikini clad throughout the picture)wears thin very quickly, and even though I am a fan of Wilson, I found this picture to be hard work. Always waiting for something to get going leaves you feeling deflated as the end titles roll, and aside from a few sparse moments of comedy I cannot really recommend this movie. Freeman is as always engaging, but even his talents are wasted here, and one suspects that the original 1969 movie was better as it at least had an ending. The confusing and implied added "twist" at the end here makes no sense at all, and feels like a fun ride that ends halfway round. Rainy day material only, and rent before buying.

Halle Berry has certainly got the look (and "got milk?" in one fun scene), in this attempt to bring the marvel character up to date, but sadly that's about it. The most recent comparison would of course have to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the leather clad feline fighter in Tim Burtons Batman Returns, and whereas I understand characters must evolve with the times, they should not be changed altogether. Pfeiffer and Burton came close to encapsulating the multi faceted role, whereas this time around the production team and director seem to have missed by a mile. Ms Berry plays Patience Phillips, a Plain Jane artist, seeking her inner self, and trapped working for a large cosmetic conglomerate as a designer. She overhears something bad about the companies latest product and is dispatched forthwith, by the villainous Sharon Stone, as wife to the head of the company. Reborn with the aid of a mystical Egyptian Mau cat, and a seemingly all wise "little old lady" she emerges as Catwoman, and sets about bringing her erstwhile foes to justice, and in so doing discover her true self. The visual distraction of her in a costume that would have fried the censors back in the 60's may be enough for adolescents, or the less demanding viewer, but this is a pretty poor attempt really. The darkness and depth of the Marvel creation is never seen, as Ms Berry plays out a little girl lost turned Vigilante with a muddled ambivalence. Staying well inside the Politically Correct (PC) line, she is almost shown as a goody two shoes, reluctantly playing a part and keeping everyone happy, rather than getting inside the storybook character. Another BIG complaint for me is the CGI fusion with live action. Much like the "Blade" movies, seeing a cartoon computer overlay scramble up walls, flip, turn, jump and perform inhuman stunts doesn't work I'm afraid, even if you do seemlessly match it with the actor in places. Even impressive SfX should compliment a films story, NOT try and carry it altogether. There are some nice extra's on the DVD however, and the story is not too ridiculous. The supporting cast are sound, and the visuals OK, but you keep feeling that the script writer and director should have taken the plunge a little more, rather than just dipping their toes into an Iconic character such as they have here. OK for a wet afternoon, and a PG audience, but that's about it. Disappointing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment, of Tarantino's quirky homage to ultra violence, spaghetti westerns, and martial arts movies, and was looking forward to this closing sequel. I gave 3.5 stars and that really is a stretch, the pace and absorbing direction of the first explosive film have seemingly evaporated. This is way way way tooooooo long, with overdone scenes, close ups and dramatic music, in an attempt I presume to give an artistic flair and fill in the drama. A fair amount of back story though essential is also overly protracted, and the end result leaves you feeling a little cheated. Were this a stand alone sequel, you could be more forgiving, but as an original single movie broken into two volumes, this is a let down. I think it was right to break the movie up, but whereas the first movies 111 minutes flew by, this marathon 137 minutes drags annoyingly. It seems as though the editing room went into overdrive in an attempt to "pad out" this movie which has a very large "filler scenes" feel to it. I did enjoy seeing the story close out, but would have enjoyed it much more with more action, less talk, and about 30 minutes less running time. Not bad, but not great.

When the movie tag line reads "Revenge was all he had left" you could be forgiven for expecting a straight out of the box Van Damme / Seagal style beat em up, but like wine, Jean Claude seems to be improving with age. Although the script is dogged with formula trappings, gone are the complicated and annoyingly overlong martial art fight scenes where the heroes can take inhuman beatings, and take on a whole army single handed, replaced instead, with a great deal of gunfire and short graphic violent episodes. JCVD plays Ben Archer who gets mixed up in a drug trafficking, INS corruption, Oriental mafia style yarn, whose wife is murdered and son is kidnapped 10 minutes into the picture. Surprisingly though, we don't follow the standard pattern from here, and what follows is dark, gritty, and often extremely violent but reasonably plausible revenge story. Well deserving of an R rating, and probably bordered the NC17 rating especially in one scene where someone is tortured to death with an electric drill. The director cleverly leaves much to the subjective imagination of the viewer as a lot of violence happens just off screen, but there are also plenty of action sequences to balance the script, and please fans alike. I've always liked Van Damme movies (with a few exceptions) and it's nice to see him evolving and becoming more actor driven. With out a hint of an opportunity to do his trade mark "box splits" he instead almost quietly wades through the picture with a brooding menace that is both believable and engaging. Overall, and despite some sizeable plot holes, and lack of back story this is a good movie, and although (like the aforementioned Seagal) most of Jean Claudes movies are straight to video these days, this one at least probably deserved a theatrical release. Even though it has a small studio feel, and lacks the production polish of say "The Punisher" or "Man on Fire" it's not far behind in entertainment value. DVD quality is good but not exceptional, and "extra's" are a bit thin on the disc. Purchase if you are a big fan, otherwise rent first. Enjoy.

Talk about martial arts and you are sure to hear Bruce Lee's name mentioned. The 20th century icon so tragically cut down before his true potential was realized (and even before this movie was released) has gained almost immortal status, over the last 30 years. This movie was the jewel in his filmaking crown, and paved the way for countless stars since. What I liked particularly however was the number of indepth and interesting extra's on the DVD set. There is some cross referring, as a lot of these documentaries and commentaries have been individually released previously but this is a great complete package. Often referred to as &quot;one of a kind&quot; in his area of expertise, for me at least he will always be - often imitated, never equalled. 5 Stars all the way.

Ok, so the historical aspect is questionable, so what? This is classic John Wayne, good guys against bad guys, and predictably great until the final reel. I always felt they left the door open a little for a sequel, or moreover that this was placing a John Wayne bootprint on the story behind the story of the Lincoln County War. Whichever way, I thoroughly enjoy this every time I see it. Probably not one of the &quot;GREAT&quot; John Wayne westerns, and I'm being a little generous with 4 stars, but the transfer quality to DVD makes it worth it, although there isn't any extra stuff. Just under two hours, and a little violent for very young children, otherwise Enjoy

This is hardly Glens 20 Greatest Hits - and is a bit of a shameless repackaging. There are more than 3 instrumental tracks and two recorded live, which do take away from the quality of this album. Considering that he has had over 30 albums released and has a huge range of talents, one feels that this compilation was put together by someone, who knows very little about the man and his music. Still a reasonable album, the reproduction quality of some of the tracks also lets it down. To be fair, I have found a better selection of Glens music on bargain basement cd's in this past,. With todays technology, and availabilty - this should have been better.

You could be forgiven after watching this movie, to think it is a pilot movie for an English style "Soprano's", and be keenly awaiting the next installment after the end credits roll. The thrust of the story revolves around the seedier side of the London underworld, and is atmospheric, and at times a gritty urban drama. Clive Owen plays a former gangland boss who has (for some reason that is only ever hinted at) disappeared into obscurity, small time menial jobs, and living in a converted panel van, in the rural countryside. His friend (left behind, along with girlfriend, and former associates) seek him out, after his younger playboy brother is found dead, apparently having commited suicide, after being raped (yes you heard me , raped). Mr Owen, must revisit his old ways we assume, to find the reason behind the death, and bring the villians to justice, London mobster style. Sounds like a great drama, but what we get is a long and plodding build up with many questions unanswered. The film begins to deliver on the promise of it's opening hour or so in the last 5 minutes of running time, but then leaves everything unanswered, and the viewer hanging. Owen is believable as the brooding "Kray Twins" style gangster in contemporary London, and there is a good supporting cast. But most will agree that the talent on display is wasted. This is a compelling film, and fairly good story, spoilt by some wayward directing, and a long slow build up to a nothing ending. That may sound harsh, and other professional "Critics" as usual have raved about this - I must have missed the point - very disappointing.

One review hails this film as "They don't make Sci Fi films like this any more!" and after about 9 minutes watching you can see why (thankfully). Saying that it is protracted, dull, painfully slow and confusing is probably being kind, as what started out as a "great idea for a movie" has succumb to an over self indulgent directors depiction of a fairly bland screenplay. George Clooney travels to a distant galaxy where he meets his deceased wife via almost tangible flashback sequences and seems to be part of a special mission to discover the meaning of life, or something like it. Unfortunately, when one recalls, or even reads older Sci Fi literature of the type so ground braking by the likes of Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick and the like, one thing is painfully obvious. Great Fiction literature lives and flourishes in the subjective imagination of the reader NOT the viewer. And it is incredibly difficult to succesfully make the transition from page to screen without losing a lot in the process. I have not actaully read the book that this movie is based on, but feel sure this depiction will pale in comparison to a probably reasonable, if pulp style story. This will be one I'm sure Mr Clooney will wish to forget in a hurry, and those that can endure it to the final frame, will no doubt feel the same. Avoid!

I could almost hear Don LaFontaine's voice over trailer in my head "Starring no-one, you've ever heard of" as I began this movie, but thought I would give it a chance, as I love the Western movie genre.Trouble is that it's been done infinitely better than this, and as good an idea of trying to revive the western (again) this is a dry, and boring flick.The script is actually not that bad, predictable but still OK, it just never gets going. Everyone seems to be spending so much time being laconic and "in character" they forget to actually act.Not too much else to say really. Cowboy with closet full of skeletons much face evil land baron (and his own inner demons) to save the day, win the girl, rescue the town blah de blah blah.Where's Randolph Scott when you need him?2 stars.

Toby Maguire and Jeff Bridges star in this factually based picture about a financially struggling racehorse owner and unknown jockey who battle all odds with and old neglected nag and end up winning the Kentucky Derby. I don't mind giving that tidbit away because the ending is a plain as can be from about 2 minutes into the movie. However, that's where the complaints end - it's well acted, very enjoyable, and impressively filmed in all senses, and although it won't I'm sure set anyone's world ablaze, it is one of the better offerings on DVD of late. The widescreen is a must for the racing scenes, and one or two nice extra's on the DVD, outweigh the VHS option. Enjoy

A lot of interest will probably be following Russell Crowes earlier movies , with the release of &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and here his acting talents are pretty clear. A graphic and often disturbing depiction of neo nazi thugs in contemporary Australia, this movie is not for the faint hearted. The overiding message of the futility of violence is masterfully delivered without ever being patronising, and an excellent support cast bring the movie a freshness often missing in films today. Being something of a budget movie it was greeted with rave reviews but unfortunately, after building nicely it seems t the Director either ran out of ideas, or money and the storyline seems to end abruptly and almost unexpectantly - leaving you a little frustrated. This is a good movie, and worth seeing, but be prepared for some disappointments.

Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the Brothers of the title, look like they really enjoyed themselves making this movie, and whereas that's a good thing, it does take away from some of the picture. This is the first movie that Terry Gilliam has done since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) and is a return to some of the more fantastical elements of his imagination, and directing skills. Most of his movies have either been disastrous, or remain cult classics with his fans, and hopefully this will be a welcome return to the big screen, and the box office.The story is an interesting twist on the famous fairytale authors, suggesting that the Brothers fed on the fears and superstitions of local peasants back in the 1800 and something's, by showing up and ridding the folks from demons, witches and the like with their own magic and exorcisms. The fact that they provided the "false" spirits in the first place through inventive (for the time) magic shows and props, was just incidental to the fact that they were heroes making an honest living. All seems well until the arrival of Jonathan Pryce as a warring French General in the region of occupied Germany where the brothers are working, who arrests them for being charlatans, and makes them a mafia style offer. They can either stay and be tortured to death by his henchman Cavaldi (brilliantly comic performance by Peter Stormare, piled high with pathos) or investigate the disappearance of all the young girls at a nearby town, on the edge of an enchanted wood. Pryce believes that someone with a similar MO to the Grimms is up to no good, as do the Grimms themselves, until they arrive, and actually see things that are more than hard to explain.The banter between Damon and Ledger is great, Ledger being the younger more imaginative sibling who makes notes on all their travels (hinted at being the famous fairytale bible) and Damon more rational and grounded. It will of course take a combination of them both, and the local knowledge of the fetching Lena Headey as Angelika to solve the mystery.I never felt like this was a big budget picture, the locations are fairly grim themselves, with rain filled muddy streets in small villages, and a forest made on a sound stage, but the overall effect was a real treat. Gilliam injects enough "magic" into the picture without being way way "out there" as you felt in movies like The Fisher King, and Baron Munchausen, and supports the maxim, that less is more.I won't spoil the story; it's inventive, funny, a little spooky in places for younger viewers, and cleverly laced with many references to the many and varied much loved tales of the famous authors. Go see for yourself, chances are you'll have fun. Enjoy!

This moderately succesful, and highly inventive monastic "whodunnit" from 1986 makes it's way to DVD, and in so doing will surely captivate a whole new audience. Sean Connery plays Brother Wiiliam of Baskerville, a renowned Sherlock Holmes of the Church, who comes to the aid of an isolated abbey in Northern Italy, and attempts to solve a recent spat of mysterious deaths. Connery's arrival actually accelerates the body count, and there is some subtle commentary interlaced about the differences of religious persuasion between Connery (A Franciscan Monk, dedicated to poverty) and the resident Roman Catholic Abbot, and his flock. As the mystery deepens, the Inquisition is summoned to speed up the investigation before an impending papal delegation visits, in the form of the fanatical, and deliciously malevolent Bernardo Gui (played by F Murray Abraham). Brother William and Gui do not of course see eye to eye, as we learn they have crossed paths before in a previous church "investigation". A baby faced Christian Slater plays Connerys young apprentice, Adso of Melk, who is keen to involve himself in the mystery, but terrified of the consequences, and the two characters play off each other nicely. Whoever was in charge of make up, set design and casting is to be congratulated, for the eerie remoteness of the location is almost tangible. Add to this, a positively grotesque collection of Monks, and some seriousy UGLY people, and the flavor of the era almost leaves a taste in the mouth. A fairly graphic sex scene involving Slater and a peasant girl caused something of a stir at time of release, and the overall theme of the picture is definitely adult, dealing with murder, treachery, and torture. I loved this movie, and am glad to see the DVD release for exceptional picture and sound quality but have one concern. The movie is such a great thriller that keeps you involved (and guessing) right up to the final frame so much, that you probably won't watch it again once you know how it ends. Visually stunning movie, but not much on the repeat viewing scale. Enjoy

Great sword and sandal epic from Wolfgang Petersen, who is beginning to get something of a Cecille B DeMille reputation for movies on a grand scale. The main difference being of course that the former had to rely on literally thousands of extra's, whereas Mr. Petersen has the luxury of CGI to help weave his magic.OK let's start, this is a VERY GOOD movie, maybe not GREAT, but thoroughly enjoyable, well acted, directed, and staged with excellent set designs, locations and a solid list of stars (and the list goes on). Brad Pitt as Achilles is the focal point of most of the picture, deserving of praise for the amount of preparation he made for the role, and the action moves steadily throughout the film as we head toward the climactic and inevitable "Trojan Horse" portion of the movie. Like most, I'm a little overdosed on CGI armies swarming like flies, and have lost some of the "wow that looks so amazing" elation I first got with other movies like Lord of the Rings a couple of years ago, but otherwise I was impressed, very impressed. I'm also a little tired of the mainstream critics bemoaning the movie for not having the authenticity of the Greek hero, or portraying the true ideals of the Greek drama / tragedy as Homer intended it. Err hello? Welcome to 2004 - If you have actually read either The Iliad or The Odyssey (as I did many years ago) one thing you will know is that to make an "authentic" movie - it would have to be about 17 hours long, and about as exciting as watching paint dry. This is a worthy adaptation for a modern mainstream audience, and is action packed, plausible for the most part and very entertaining. I will spare the synopsis that has been covered to the point of complete revelation by national reviewers already, but make sure to look out for Peter O Toole's superb portrayal as King Priam, and some other excellent supporting roles, from not least Eric Bana as Hector. A lot of battles, pretty violent in places, and some nudity give it the R rated tag, and although the running time could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes, all round I thoroughly recommend. Enjoy

If you like computer generated animation with a kick and don't mind adult themes, a LOT of profanity and innuendo then this movie will probably provide you with plenty of laughs. Be warned though, this is NOT for kids or even older adults with little tolerance for this kind of anarchic humor.Not to be confused (or even compared for that matter) with the like minded South Park, or even earlier Beavis & Butthead, Tripping goes one step further into some pretty filthy humor.The characters are funny, but as a viewer it's a plus to be familiar with Star Trek, Star Wars, Deep Space Nine and most other contemporary Sci Fi movies and shows to appreciate the gags.It's much easier to parody using animation, it doesn't require the scripting, or acting and set locations of say a Zucker brothers movie, or even the more recent Scary Movie style parodies. But don't be put off by that on it's own, as there are some genuine funny moments.Like the TV series the graphics, and sound are excellent, as is the voice acting by people like Stephen Root (Office Space), but this will probably dwell in the cult basement and appeal most to the 18-25 demographic, along with other adult themed animation.Good but not great, I was underwhelmed most of the time, I'm sorry to say.3 Stars for visuals.

This is a hugely enjoyable not so black comedy, with a huge slice of pathos thrown in. Bruce Willis plays "retired" hit man moving in next door to hen pecked but lovable Matthew Perry, whose performance here is sensational. What follows is a fairly predictable but riotous storyline which to and fros between Canada and Chicago, and features some very funny moments from an excellent ensemble cast. Sharp and witty, and just a little over 90 minutes long, this is escapism at it's best. One to watch and enjoy.

I have probably seen this movie about 30 - 40 times, and never tire of it. A great cast, including a rather tender aged James Caan work a virtually mirrored script to Rio Bravo, but somehow make it different. Howard Hawks was so impressed with James Caan who played his &quot;Mississippi&quot; role with absolute solemnity, saying that it made his character even more believable during the films many humorous moments. Robert Mitchum is superb, as are Christopher George and Ed Asner, but make no mistake this film belongs to John Wayne. His trademark laconic tough guy style oozes throughout the picture, and as predictable as the movie is, it is an absolute joy to watch over and over again. A worthy addition to any home collection, if you've seen - see it again, if not you're either too young, or you've never watched much TV!. GREAT!!

Ahhh yes Suzi Quatro - the leather clad lady rocker who graced many a bedroom door in poster form in the 70's! This is not a bad collection of most of her hits, but has suffered a little with time. Almost inadvertently making the crossover from Rock based to more mainstream pop (at the height of her career) Ms Quatro was synonymous with raw energy, and rebellious raspy vocals. However, close attention reveals little in the way of intricate musical arrangements or lyrical range, and most who are musically inclined will find pretty basic stuff here. That aside, this is a nostalgic journey, and nicely packaged in chronological format giving more than a good taste of her musical talents. A little repetitious at times, but overall a good buy and fairly keenly priced. Lack of exposure in the USA may preclude this from a mainstream purchasers list which is a shame, as this CD is a good insight into one of the first female rock stars of the 70's, who arguably led the way for other more well known female singers.

The runaway success, and familiarity of &quot;There is No Arizona&quot; really launched Jamie O'Neal into the limelight, and the charts, but almost too much too soon. I purchased this album after seeing her perform live, and found it on the whole to be very enjoyable. My main criticism would be that unlike several of her peers, it seems a bit &quot;samey&quot; and one could be forgiven for listening to any given track (except the aforementioned Arizona) and saying &quot;Who was that?&quot;. One can't help feeling that the majority of the album content is overshadowed by her debut single, and trys to compete, instead of embracing experimentation with each new addition. I am hopeful that there will be an improvement in the next offering, for a star who has shown so much promise, but looks destined to fall into obscurity otherwise.

I first saw this movie expecting a horror / thriller and impressed by the cast (Johnny Depp is excellent) was steadily absorbed by it's moody and suspenseful storyline. Unfortunately that's where you leave it - after being on the edge of your seat for nearly two hours, and playing guess and double guess what's about to happen - the end titles appear. A very brilliant idea for a story, is wasted and as good as the performances of Depp, and Langella and as impressive as the artful direction of Polanski is they cannot save this movie. Do yourself a favour - Rent before you Buy

Maybe it's because I'm not a fantasizing teen high school girl, or maybe it's because I haven't read the book, or maybe I just don't care.But from a film lovers point of view (as in story, acting, effects, credibility, tension, drama) this movie is decidedly average.Oh wait a minute, I can hear the hissing and booing already from the hordes of blind lemming style fans who have embraced what has undoubtedly become a phenomenon.And that's the problem, Stephanie Meyers very successful stories which have satiated the thirst of many a love starved, gooey eyed teenager has made the leap from page to screen, and I will say commendably so on such a modest budget. But, as usual, the idolatrous masses have jumped the common sense ship and raved about this movie with the argument that "it must be brilliant, because it's Twilight".Forget the hype for just a second and hear me out before you pan this review. I sat down to watch this with my 21 year old daughter 122 minutes later I was amazed, truly amazed. A wafer thin plot surrounding a mortal/vampire love affair with more padding than a stiff sofa. The acting, locations and effects (as cheap as they are) are all OK, and the movie is NOT awful or anything, but come on! More plot holes than Swiss cheese,I'm expected to believe that Bella takes a few days to figure it all out (after no other person has a clue) falls head over crucifix for bad boy Edward, and then his family of "nice" vampires help save her from the marauding "bad" vampire James?Throw in divorced parents, a stand off Daddy, who's also a Sheriff and, a ton of High School angst and fitting in, and that's about it really.I also (I'm sure I'm not the first) couldn't help thinking about the excellent HBO series True Blood.In that series, a mind reading mortal falls for a vampire who's mind she cannot read, in this a mind reading Vampire, falls for a girl who's mind he cannot read? Funny eh?There's also a ton of other similarities, but that's by the by really.The bottom line is that Vampires are sexy, scary and always make a good story. Screen adaption wise, this movie does nothing that Buffy the Vampire Slayer didn't do infinitely better in the past.The bottom line - I gave it 3 stars, it's OK, it's certainly NOT great, but will undoubtedly be a great franchise of movies for the film company and the author, who will ride the squealing teen masses wave. The sequel is already planned for a November 2009 release.Oh, by the way - if you're wondering which came first...... well True Blood was published in 2001, twilight in 2005.

The only reason I have not heaped more stars on this 1961 classic is the lack of extra's on the DVD, although the Widescreen reproduction is good, the picture and sound crisp, and overall a great package. Recently referred to in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; whilst drawing parallels of futile &quot;last stands&quot;, this movie is beginning to attract a new audience, as well as enthrall those who remember it the first time around. With the renewed interest in the genre (Troy / Alexander the Great) at theaters now, and in post production respectively, this is a timely release. Another plus is that this movie is seldom seen on countless reruns on TV like so many, and is a worthy addition to any fans collection. In a similar way to Troy, there is an air of inevitability to the story which heads for the ill fated battle at Thermopylae. Some policital bungling and bad planning pits Richard Egan and his elite but small army against the ravages of Xerxes (he who commanded an army of 1,000,000)at the aforementioned pass, and the end result though predictable is stirring. Some interesting metaphors abound (as was the practice at that time) comparing the political problems of 1961 to the historical aspects of the movie, but otherwise this is a solid picture. The battle sequences are a bit tame by todays standards, but there is a wonderful dramatic quality to the direction and script, often missing in todays CGI festooned reproductions. Oldy but Goody - Enjoy!

Plagued with delays, reshoots, on set bickering and changed release dates Director Johnston's remake/homage makes it to the silver screen, and is a good old fashion scary movie.Interestingly, the DVD and Blu-Ray release will feature a further 17 minutes of footage, aka "Directors Cut" which according to an interview with the director is mostly in the first half of the movie to build tension, and fill in some back story.It was said that here (the cinematic) release wanted to be concise and get to the first transformation sequence in as soon as possible to keep the audience attention. This ideal I can understand, as all too often one must sit through an hour of build up to get to the meat of the action (no pun intended) and see what has been teased in trailers and TV spots. Time will tell as to whether these 17 minutes make a whole lot of difference, my view is that it will be a nice to have, rather than a need to have. For me the picture felt pretty complete.Del Toro is great from the first scene as the grieving brother summoned by his late siblings fianc&eacute; to the funeral, to try to find out what happened after his mangled remains are found in a ditch near the family's stately home.There's an air of a troubled past about from the get go, as he reunites with his estranged father Anthony Hopkins. We learn in flashback that he witnessed his mothers apparent suicide and was committed to an asylum and suffered untold horrors by his father at a young age, in hopes of cleansing him of something.Hopkins as always is masterful, and more than distracting as the brooding Lord of the manor, with more than a few secrets to hide.Hugo Weaving, as Inspector Abberline also puts in a fine performance, as does Art Malik in a nice cameo role.The similarities to the original Lon Chaney are hinted at more than played out, but it feels, and looks good as he begins to delve into the history of Blackmoor, the nearby gypsy encampment, and the family "curse".They did a great job with filming locations. Chatsworth house (The Blackmoor stately home) is actually in a lot better condition than they made it appear with a dreary run down CGI touch up, and may be familiar to viewers of many movies like Pride & Prejudice. Actually about 160 miles from London, for the purpose of the movie it's setting is supposed nearer to the capital, as Del Toro walks there from London towards the climax of the movie. Castle Combe in Wiltshire is used extensively for the village scenes, and creates a perfect period feel for the late 19th century setting. Those who have actually been to that part of England will know that "yes, it actually looks like that today" an obvious reason why it was chosen.Emily Blunt is captivating but deliberately understated as the grieving fianc&eacute;, slowly drawn to Del Toro's gentle handling, and the romantic connection is thoughtful without being overplayed.So to the special effects and make up, well those familiar with Rick Bakers talents, particularly in the excellentAmerican Werewolf in London Special Edition(which is seen by many as still the benchmark for the most realistic depiction of the transition from man to wolf) will not be disappointed. Here however, we get more of a direct reference to the original, in that Del Toro is an upright Wolf Man, sort of 50/50 as opposed to being completely lupine or monstrous as in the recent Underworld movies for example.It was also interesting to read that the makeup took only two hours to apply, and one to remove, with Baker remarking that the hirsute Del Toro was easy to change from his current form, to "just a more hairy version of Del Toro with teeth and claws"!You can complain about the constant full moons, the question of where Del Toro's clothes disappear to and reappear when he changes back, and a number of artistic flaws in the story, but the pace and suspense of the movie keep you viewing. This is escapism after all.There are some graphic scenes during the numerous changes and attacks, but the strength of the tension lies more in the good old fashioned scary moments, plenty of searching of dark rooms, and roaming around at night in forests, and more than a few "Boo" moments to make most people alarmed.It's a relatively predictable story, I saw the end coming a mile away, as I'm sure most did, and of course the filmmakers have the left the door open for a sequel. That said, it's an impressive piece of gothic horror well presented with today's technology and sure to do well at the box office, and on DVD. 4 Stars.

As I have just watched and reviewedThe Road [Blu-ray] and I actually watched this movie first, I felt it only fair that I should review it as well, as they both deal with a similar plotline, but are starkly different movies.The synopsis is covered in great detail above (and in other reviews) so I won't spend too long on that, or put in any spoilers, but this story is so much more than was quite unfairly described by one professional critic as "The Road Warrior (Mad Max) without cars!"Denzel Washington plays a nomadic man on a mission, wandering for some 30 years through a post apocalyptic landscape carrying the last known copy of the King James Bible, answering a calling, and quest to deliver it somewhere important, knowing only that he must go west.Like the aforementioned "Road" he is waylaid by marauding gangs, cannibalism, and a general dystopian population left either blind or maimed by whatever catastrophe occurred. Enter Gary Oldman as a intelligent but malevolent self proclaimed leader of a small town, surviving in the dust and misery, hell bent on getting his hand on the book, and hoping to rekindle the power of faith in people for his own ends.That's about it in a nutshell really, there are some other characters of course, and little subplots, and for those familiar with the Book of Eli in the Bible itself, there are some obvious connotations added, but these are never overplayed.I want to talk about the film itself for a second and the camera work and CGI, the Blu-Ray transfer is as crisp as I have seen, and they have made this World so believable and real on screen, you can almost taste the dust. The heavily tinted camera work adds depth, and a grey despair to the whole movie, which arguably would have much flatter without it. The story itself is clever, if a little unbelievable at times, and is much more stylized than other movies of the genre, but it feels right for this movie. The acting is great from everyone, even another little cameo for Tom Waits (always a joy to watch) is great.Not a movie for repeat viewing I fancy, once you know the end, have lived the "journey" and got to the twist in the tale, but nonetheless a very good movie.Plenty of action pads out the more thoughtful aspects of the film, as Denzel is a sort of machete wielding one man army, as if possessed by a higher power (again the nod to religion) in his single minded of purpose, and unyielding journey.I knocked off half a star (maybe unfairly) for the frequent, "is he or isn't he?", "how did he do that", "how come they......" aspects of the movie, but I guess some poetic license by the Director is not all bad.Very impressive, visually stunning movie. 4.5 stars

I'm going to go against what I normally say in a movie review here in that puritans who will no doubt lambaste this film for it's historical inaccuracies and poetic narrative, probably deserve to be heard (in this case). I am all for entertainment, I don't usually care if aspects are distorted in historical based drama, and I appreciate the need for brevity on screen to keep the audience entertained as well as informed.All that said, it's hard to understand how to describe this picture.There is little in the way of action or sex, or high drama for that matter, and the subject material (The English Civil War) is hardly a global moneybag rich for storytelling in the way that say Braveheart, or The Patriot translated onto the screen.Casting is also a BIG problem, mainly by association. Tim Roth, who is a fine actor, has of late played some pretty psychotic and off color roles, and one feels he just doesn't bring enough to the role of Cromwell. History (even from contemporary sources) tells us that Cromwell was devoted family man, who loved music and jokes, also a tolerant tactician who actually suppressed tyrant Presbyterians whilst he searched for a constitutional settlement with the king. Here he is portrayed as an almost sullen "Socialist" or marauding Olly North type character with little or no depth. Rupert Everett exudes charm as Charles, and obviously researched the finer points of a king remembered as hardly a "dandy" but certainly a well spoken epicurean.Dougray Scott is the best thing about the movie without doubt, his portrayal as Fairfax is gritty, determined and very believable (even if his on screen relationship is historically way off).All in all the movie is not very bad, it's just not very good either, and sort of meanders it's way through the 1hr 40 min run time without any real satisfaction for the viewer.It's a shame, when you consider such an accomplished cast. I would have thought they would have carried this off with more zeal. Hollywood is often criticized for skewed views of history in favor of "in your face" entertainment. Here we seem to have gotten the former, sadly without the latter. 3 stars for a stellar cast, 2 for the content.

I just revisited my own childhood (to a degree) by watching this splendid DVD version of Ian Flemings once revered Musical/Family drama. This represents a time when wholesome just didn't refer to exotic bread from the local health store, but solid, morally grounded family fun. The story is essentially simple; The car of the title is a former Grand Prix winner now rusting in an English Junkyard circa 1930's, and now resigned to a plaything for two impoversihed local children. These children belong to Dick Van Dyke as good hearted but unrealistically wacky inventor Caractacus Potts, who lives in a windmill with the children and their grandfather. Along comes local Confectionary heiress Truly Scrumptous (yes great name) and adds to the mix for some adventurous escapades with the car, which is undergoing a cosmetic revamping by the aforementioned Potts. Everything is here in the right quantity for a balanced family musical, of the kind sadly seldom seen today. Arguably the car, which is magic, can fly, sail on the ocean, and never look used, is the star, but the real power of the movie lies in simple but excellent script direction, and character portrayal. Evil German Barons, a Fairytale castle, lush English meadows and some other excellent locations weave the tapestry as we watch and the end result is sheer joy. Although some may find the special effects a little obvious by todays standards, the film has more than stood the test of time, and will I feel continue to enthrall and entertain each successive generation. My 3 year old remained glued throughout, and even loved the annoyingly catchy title song which though overdone, is an essential blast from the past - for me anyway, as I still remembered the words!

Most US audiences first tast of Paul Hogan was in the hugely succesful Crocodile Dundee, with Mr Hogan in the title role. Although this movie tries to ride on the shirt tails of that success, it is actually a very well made, and self standing production. Paul began his career many years earlier on Australian TV in his own show which was a series of sketches, observations, and almost a down under version of a one man Saturday night live. Anyone familiar with this early material will enjoy the mix of subtle antipodean humor, and at times slapstick sight gags in this picture. But this is NO Dundee style flick, despite the repeated pairing of Hogan and Kozlowski (as the love interest)and is a light, poignant and thought provoking storyline. Another great strength is the moral comment that is discreetly delivered, without being overly sentimental, or patronising. Hogan plays a reformed petty thief who is convinced he has died and been delivered back to Earth to make amends for his wayward lifestyle. This knowledge makes him conduct himself as if indestructible, with some funny results, and the whole picture has a feelgood flavour, whilst cleverly retaining a sober undertone. This apsect of the picture is never really revealed to the audience, and the "is he, isn't he"? aspect adss an extra dimension to the comedy. An excellent cameo from Charlton Heston as God, and a solid supporting cast and script, leaves one wondering why this film was only moderately succesful at the box office, and more importantly why it has yet to make it to DVD. With the amount of relaunching, repackaging, special editions, and anniversary releases of a ton of movies these days, this film doesn't deserve to be overlooked. A contemporary "It's a Wonderful Life" it may not quite be, but it IS a very good movie. Enjoy!

Luc Besson should be fairly well known by now, even here in the USA, with his involvement in the recent From Paris with Love, The Transporter movies, and writing credits for The Fifth Element, District 13, and Kiss of the Dragon.Here he is directing (back in 1990)arguably some of his best work. Those unfamiliar with him in the Directors chair should check outLe Grand Blue: The Big Blue (Director's Cut)which is sadly still not available here in Blu-Ray format andL&eacute;on: The Professional (Theatrical and Extended Edition) [Blu-ray] as well as the aforementioned Fifth Element.In time honored fashion of course, this movie gained little exposure back in the 90's so a remake was deemed necessary, casting the always appealing Bridget Fonda in the lead role, and the movie was remade for US audiences, and renamedPoint of No Return [Blu-ray]Whether it was the fact that Nikita is in French, or some other reason, and although the remake was not a turkey by any means, with some more explosive hollywood style action, it remains tepid in comparison for the depth of drama that Nikita brings out amid the action.Nikita, is a bummed out drug addict with no future, friends or family, a mendicant who embodies all that is bottom feeding trash. She is taken (or rather kidnapped) by a government agency, cleaned up and trained to be a cold blooded assassin.Why? you may ask (as one reviewer did) well I would surmise that she wouldn't be missed by anyone, recognizable to anyone, and of course would becompletely expendable.What follows is a gritty high speed drama, of the type Besson has become associated with. Brutal at times, and almost frenetic, but thoroughly absorbing and as good an action drama as that decade produced.Tcheky Karyo is excellent as her hard nosed handler, and Jean Reno pops up as the "cleaner" a similar role to which he starred in 4 years later in the excellent Leon:The Professional (mentioned above). But the film belongs hands down to Anne Parillaud who sizzles on screen, sexy and smart, emotional charged, ruthless and yet inwardly scared and confused, a real powerhouse performance.This is a great movie, some may find the 90's narrative a little dated but it's more than worth a watch.The Blu-Ray transfer is clean, not exceptional, but still very good.

Despite the fact that this movie virtually tiptoed in and out of the box office limelight when it was released, it is still a very watchable, and often scary detective style thriller. What seems a simple missing person case brings Mickey Rourke to steamy (and often seamy) New Orleans and Harlem in the fifties. Working for a curiously menacing but well spoken client called Loius Cyphre, played superbly by Robert De Niro, our gumshoe must dig and delve into the past and try and retrace the steps of the disappearance. Cleverly twisted, and at times a little hard to follow, it transpires that the aforementioned Mr Cyphre (Lucifer in case you missed it) is actually on a harvest of souls that have been previously owed. The closer O' Rourke gets to the truth, the more horrifying it becomes, for him and everyone around him, in a very suspenseful, and often quite disturbing way. A young Lisa Bonet appeared in a fairly graphic, explicit and questionable sex scene in the original movie, which brought much controversy upon it, but has been restored in the unrated version. Despite the unlikely 80's designer stubble sported throughout by our hero, being fashionable in even the shadiest areas of town in the 50's, O'Rourke plays his part extremely well, often bemused, and superbly portarying genuine fear at the revelations he uncovers. Sure to thrill any audience today who likes the supernatural/thriller/mystery drama, it's still highly watchable. Perhaps enjoy is the wrong word here, but worth a visit!

Time-travellin yarn about a group of modern day students who travel back to 1357 France to save their history professor. After becoming quickly embroiled with bloodthirsty knights, the bubonic plague, and a full-fledged war, the movie sets itself up to be a reasonable attempt at the already overdone time traveling theme. Unfortunately, despite the pedigree of the Michael Crichton bestseller on which it was based, the movie rapidly becomes bland and predictable, and too reliant on the viewers willing suspension of disbelief. Suffering from a surprisingly weak script (considering the book for a moment) and fairly average performances the movie struggles to really get going which is a shame. Although the representation of a war torn Middle Ages Europe is visually impressive, the rest of it just gets rather numbing, and one feels that the movie was deservedly chewed by the critics after it's cinematic release last year. Paul Walker (The Fast &amp; the Furious) may wish to forget that he picked this movie as a vehicle to catapult his growing stardom, as only his most ardent fans will find much to shout about. Very Disappointing.

It's interesting to look back on this movie that is now 10 years old, but demonstrates Carrey's range and comic talent in almost seedling form. A simple and funny pastiche on the private detective genre finds Carrey as Ace Ventura, a pet detective (as the title suggests) who's big break appears to be coming in the case of the kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins mascot. A better than average script with some excellent gags ensues, with some nice cameos for Sean Young as the tyrannical police chief, and not least Dan Marino playing himself in slapstick fashion. But this is Carrey's vehicle from start to finish, his wacky and bawdy character almost explodes across the film, and ultimately steals the show. Often very silly, but consistently funny, this movie should now begin to attract a second generation of viewers, which it will accomplish well, being neither dated, or too topical for the year of production.

Steve Martin plays, err Steve Martin (surprise) in the feelgood family &quot;ahhh&quot;movie release over the holiday season last year. Somehow encumbered with 12 children he bumbles through a cheesy plot and encounters many hilarious yet touching episodes and lessons in life on how to be a good father, friend, confidante, and most importantly how to boost a recently flagging career with this kind of non taxing and benign drivel.

Assuming you know the story (and one hopes most of us do) I felt you had to be neither religiously inclined, or interested in historical theology to take a lot away with you after seeing this picture. Heavily criticized for it's brutal depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and maligned by some for encouraging anti semetism, I found it powerful and very moving, if disturbing. It is a testament to Mel Gibson's vision, and perseverance that NO major Hollywood studio picked up this picture, which was self funded by Mr Gibson at a cost of around $30 million. The fact that the dialogue is chiefly aramaic (the movie is subtitled throughout) could also be seen as enough to discourage a lot of viewers, but there is no doubt that this is powerful film making at it's best. Perhaps "enjoy" is the wrong word to use in how I felt after the movie which is violent and unforgiving in showing Christ's persecution and eventual execution on the cross, but it is compelling, absorbing and emotionally charged. The success of the picture (I feel) lies in the what has been the chief subject of critisicm, the blow by blow punishment and torture the viewer cannot help but share with the main character. However, perhaps this is the strength of the movie, and I believe Gibson's aim, in showing what has always been hinted at, or happened "off screen" in other films of the genre. Put simply, it is saying that knowing or saying that Christ suffered and died for our sins is not enough, this is how, and why, open, graphic and painful. Not a movie I would recommend for the squeamish or sensitive, and certainly NOT for children (of any age). James Caveziel is believable and strong in the lead role, and more than ably supported by a cast of almost unknowns. Top marks all round, a film that will live in the memory long after you have seen it. Go see it for yourself, you may found out a lot you didn't know

I have been less than complimentary in my previous reviews of Mr Seagals recent offerings, but please don't think I have anything personal against him. The reverse is in fact true in that I have often been admonished for being a stalwart fan over the years. That having been said, I simply cannot recommend this cringeworthy, and dire outpouring any more than his other recent turkeys, which have been pretty awful to say the least. Perhaps his material and script choices are letting him down too much? Earlier films were exceptional in comparison, and in a competetive genre, one was always, it seemed, able to rely on Mr Seagal to deliver the goods, so to speak. In the unikely event that a comparison was ever drawn between Steven Seagal and say Clint Eastwood for example, we would see that the latter has moved graciously into older and more believable roles that expand on the character, whilst still retaining enough action and eye candy for fans and mainstream viewers. Where Seagal has stuck with the same formula that worked in the past, and has resulted in him coming across as a comical 007 character, desperately in need of retirement. A brief synopsis here finds Seagal as an archeologist battling drug lords who are using his artifacts to traffic their product without his knowledge. He does of course take umbrage to this, and after his family, dog, pet hamster and any other thing dear to him have been attacked or killed (as usual) he justifiably goes on the rampage. That's really all you need to know, and wouldn't be too bad in itself if the film were then braced with mountains of action. But sadly, even the once revered fight choreography scenes now seem also to be in short supply, and the end result is textbook formula nonsense. I didn't really care about the characters, or the plot which is a real shame. I only hope the eagerly anticipated Under Siege 3 will bring us back to the earlier Seagal, and a much greater performance.

This is nowhere near as bad as some of Seagals, more recent straight to video releases, and tries to be more script orientated for a change. That having been said, this is not brilliant either, and Seagal seems to be suffering from a bitter irony. Despite trying to change direction a little in his movies, with his advancing years, people hire his movies for one reason, martial arts action and fight scenes - and plenty of baddies as cannon fodder for Mr Seagal to dispatch with unencumbered tenacity. Making a thoughtful and at times plodding oriental gangster drama may be a good idea, but doesn't really fit the character he chooses to play here (which incidentally is the same character he ALWAYS plays). The only reason fans of Seagal and the genre in general tolerate long periods of dialogue and drama is BECAUSE there are fight scenes, which here are sadly in very short supply. Seagal plays a CIA agent (no surprise there) but other than a standard revenge / outnumbered good guy flick, he actually tries to build a reasonable, and credible story. As an American raised in Japan, he is street wise, and well known amongst the warring powers, and is called in after a local politician is murdered. The FBI suspect the Yakuza, the CIA are sniffing around under the auspices of Homeland Security (and as usual portrayed as untrustworthy and uneasy allies) with Seagal in the middle trying to resolve the whole situation. I found a lot of similarities between this movie and "Black Rain" with Michael Douglas released some years ago now, as we are immersed into the old school Yakuza meets young money orientated disrespectful Yakuza. Add then their collaboration with Chinese Tongs in an attempt to create an all powerful drugs cartel, and oust the old boys, and you have a good set up for a movie. Mr Seagal of course has a youthful and inexperienced partner to babysit, and old flame, now assigned to follow him, and a love interest (strangely misplaced)to deal with as he wanders around Tokyo in a full length black leather coat, and a brooding stare that could wilt a daisy at 100 yards. Sadly, two thirds through the picture the Director decides to revert to killing off all he holds dear detracting from the whole flavor of the story and turns it from a reasonable drama to a silly romp. It's strange to say that the all too few fight sequences are actually very well choregraphed, and much like Seagals earlier, and infinitely better movies, but there should have been a lot more to carry the viewers interest throughout the entire picture. This movie has had some pretty bad reviews, which is a little harsh, and although 3 stars may be a little generous, fans especially should find some enjoyment here. Renting first would probably be the best advice I could offer. Enjoy

It's always difficult to bring a masterpiece of writing to the screen, and poetic licence aside, this is a reasonable attempt.Guy Pearce, shows some versatility in the lead role and ultimately learns the message that &quot;Some things Cannot Be Changed&quot; when he becomes locked away and obsessed with creating the machine of the title, after the murder of his true love, in a bungled mugging incident. The Victorian back drop is quite faithfully and believably recreated, and the acting performances on the whole are well directed. Sadly however, the script seems to have felt the need to deviate so widely from the original story (one assumes to embrace a more modern view) that it tests even the most implausible aspects of the science fiction genre. The SfX are well integrated, and this is by no means a BAD movie - but one feels that a more faithful following of HG Well's ideas, (however dated) would have resulted in a better picture. I wanted to give more, but 3 stars is really the limit.

Not wanting to address what personal issues Wolfgang Petersen has going on, with this, his latest venture in World destruction, one can't help drawing comparisons with his apparent penchant for portraying the end of mankind, in other movies like Godzilla, and Independence Day.Dennis Quaid plays a paleoclimantologist (cross between a weather expert and a fossil expert I presume) who warns of the end of the World and is predictably ignored by the powers that be until his warnings begin to unfold in dramatic and horrific fashion. He is then summoned to offer his advice (albeit too late) to the President and try to set out a plan to save mankind. Despite the advances in believable CGI representations on screen recently, what plays out before your eyes is arguably amazing and gripping viewing and builds the tension nicely. Those expecting much more than has seen in the trailers may be disappointed, but the power of the visuals I feel lies more in the eerie tiny points of realism that paint much more of a complete picture than pure in your face graphics. Sadly from this point onward the storyline takes something of a nosedive on the credibility scale, and leaves you thinking EH? Mr. Quaid is continually battling with his conscience for not spending enough quality "Dad" time with his Son Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and against his own advice to everyone else, sets off on foot to snow covered New York to save him. This is a valiant effort to portray intimate human drama amidst a morass of human annihilation, but the message gets lost and unlikely and ultimately leaves you not caring due to the implausible nature of it all. The story continues to center on a handful of characters trapped in New York but is disjointed as it tries to make you believe the importance of whether Sam should tell Laura he loves her whilst seconds before you have been told that entire continents are being obliterated, and most people in the Northern Hemisphere are likely to perish. This is NOT a bad movie, and will be undoubtedly be a big early summer hit at the box office for the main reason that the special effects are just about enough. The huge visuals successfully manage to carry the movie and make you endure a plot that is about as deep as a child's backyard swimming pool. The undertones and messages of human ignorance and perhaps timely warnings of global warming add some intelligence behind the eye candy, and make you sit up and pay attention throughout the 2 hours, which moves fairly quickly. It's just a shame that there are too many niggling and unanswered inconsistencies along the way to really pull off the story completely. 3.5 Stars at best.

OK let's start by saying that this is NO comparison to the fantastic recent trilogy of movies by Peter Jackson, and it is animated (I'll come back to that) but it is still a good movie. Considering the year of production for a second, director Ralph Bakshi had a vision, and the same kind of idea as Jackson, but without the backing, the money, or the technology to carry it off. The film follows the book very closely, and those having watched the new movies will see and hear identical scenes in this version, lifted straight from Tolkeins pages. The idea was to make TWO movies (but not simultaneously) which means this is a little muddled in mixing books 1&2, made with the obvious expectation of a sequel.The animation is mixed with a process called rotoscoping (traced over live action integrated into cell animation)in a surreal fashion in places which adds much in the way of atmosphere, and certainly makes the dark armies appear more menacing. This idea of animation was more than a little groundbreaking at the time, even though it was done chiefly to save money, and annoyed more than a few puritans in the business. Sadly this movie went down like a lead parachute at the box office, and with it went Bakshi's backing for the second film, and knowing this means you are expecting an anti climax of sorts. The DVD has little in the way of extra's, but the budget price certainly makes it worth owning. Repeated viewing does get you inside the directors vision, and obvious love of the material, and one could argue that had this been made 20 years later, Peter Jackson & Co may have been out of work, Enjoy this Cult and Collectible Classic at a great price.

This is a review of the movie seen at the theater, NOT the BD release planned for the future.Chances are if you're reading this you're a fan of the Pirates franchise, and/or Depp and company so are willing to overlook the fact that this is a money spinning exercise set squarely in the "popcorn flick" genre of summer blockbusters.Much has been made of the absence of Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, in so far as they thought it enough of a ridiculous and unnecessary 4th outing as to not be involved, but the inclusion of Penelope Cruz, and Ian McShane more than make up for that anyway (in my opinion).This latest, somewhat shorter installment treads much of the same ground as the previous 3 to no surprise, and like them or hate them, you have to agree in part to continuing a winning formula. A critics dream this is not, but of course it will still wow plenty of summer audiences, and no doubt be a financial success.So to my "muddled" comment. Well the story (which was probably conceived as a good idea somewhere) revolves around Jack Sparrow searching for the fountain of youth.Tagging along are the ever pleasing Jeffrey Rush as Barbossa chewing scenery as he goes, and arch nemesis Ian McShane as Blackbeard, complete with beautiful daughter Cruz.Secret silver chalices, CGI mermaids that change from beauty to beast while attacking, and an ever present need for the cast to explain what is going on, just makes the whole thing look muddled.Depp's antics stretch credulity even more than usual, as does most of the story, from an initial escape (again) to the plot twisting quest. Another criticism for me would be that Cruz and Depp do not have the spark or chemistry they should, probably safer to say that Depp and Rush have more.Of course it's a PG-13 so the action and eye candy abound. That's probably what saves the movie somewhat, it's less plodding than the previous movies, and as long as you can suspend disbelief enough, you'll enjoy the action sequences that seem to bombard most of the film.No spoilers here, just accept it for what it is. 3 Stars

I have had the pleasure of seeing Sara Evans perform live on two occasions, and quickly realised her potential as a future star. This album is a worthy follow up, and shows her maturity in choice of music styles, and lyrical content. The album is extremely well balanced, and doesn't have a bad track. The other great thing about it is, it's flexibility, being equally at home as background music, or belting out at high volume on the car or home stereo. A truly powerful vocalist, who is fast approaching the league of Martina McBride, and even Reba McEntire, this singer is certainly one to watch, both now and in the future. My only hope is that she doesn't change too much, the more she gets established. Not quite a &quot;must have&quot;, but almost.

This movie ends with a quote from Edmund Burke - "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing", which is a fitting and accurate underlining, of a great story.Bruce Willis plays a battle hardened and very experienced leader of a small band of Navy Seals, sent into Nigeria at a time of severe unrest and civil war to rescue an American Doctor. Pricked by the graphic images he witnesses and an inner conscious that supercedes his lifelong ability to follow "orders" he takes matters upon himself to rescue not only the good doctor, but as many of her refugee patients as he can.This is much more than an "escape" movie, as we see the elite team battle the elements and an ever nearing army of troops hot on their tracks throughout the movie, to it's bloody conclusion. The film never falls into any cliches along the way, there are no unlikely romantic nuances, and the acting is strong and extremely well guided. It also very cleverly never gives up the plot, or ending despite what we may believe throughout the movie, as the viewer will watch attentively and see, being drawn into the picture. Brutal in it's depiction of a war torn and divided country, and graphic in it's images of ethnic cleansing, this movie is not for the squeamish, but it is more than just compelling. Willis is superb, without any of the unbelievability of the Die Hard movies, to which this has been compared, and the outcome is gripping, and uplifting. A great, great movie.

I have to say I really enjoyed this movie and actually endorse the &quot;Edge of the Seat&quot; message on the rear of the box.Al Pacino is well cast as the craggy featured senior recruitment officer for the CIA, who woos a young Computer genius (played by Farrell) into the world of espionage, and governmental agency training. The young Farell rapidly becomes embroiled in a &quot;mole&quot; hunt and is constantly questioning whether he is still &quot;in training&quot;, or really in danger. What develops is a series of &quot;who's watching who&quot; encounters as he, and his trainee counterpart take part in a cat and mouse scenario, that leaves the viewing audience also playing along. Puritans will probably complain that there is a lack of accuracy in the movie, and that the final revelations seem predictable, but most people will just sit and enjoy the ride. Solid acting performances and a believable script bolster the storyline, and Farrell is excellent as the naive, almost paranoid young agent. Great suspense, and very well made.

This "homage" to the eighties "slasher" flick tries hard but falls a little flat for several reasons. Firstly this is 2007, not 1980 and what would have been huge back then (this film has no shortage of both gore and inventive murder scenes) is just not that exciting. Secondly, a cast of veritable "nobodies" which would have not mattered back then, (and arguably was essential) doesn't bring any extra style to the picture, which is predictable and almost laughable in places. Thirdly, today's moviegoer could be considered spoiled with high def special effects, celebrity cameos getting killed in a grisly fashion, and generally more polished feel to even low budget horror flicks, but when the bar is set at that level, you must be at least in the same area.It seems that today's generation of fans of this type of movie (think the Saw franchise for example) want a little more intellectual stimulation than just in your face gore.This isn't complete bilge (as the two stars denote) and has some extremely nasty on screen moments, or few jumps and (as I assume) was intended leads the viewer down a familiar path with the victims, and delivers accordingly.However, even if the genre remains loosely the same today as 25 odd years ago, at least there are usually a few more twists and turns in a modern horror, or some genuine suspense through creative scripting, and good casting. Hatchet unfortunately lacks both.

Before anyone complains that I am reviewing this before it's release, I received an advance copy from the Amazon Vine program, and to be honest, wished I hadn't.This is yet another spoof on a half dozen or more movies laden with cheap T&A;, bad jokes, stupid situations and and is generally just not funny. It's also such a shame to see Leslie Nielson in a cameo (obviously needs a paycheck)wasted with stupid lines, and bad makeup.Halloween, Hellraiser, Texas chainsaw to name but a few all get the "scary movie" treatment, but this howler definitely has more bark than bite.Our hero "Stan" Helsing spends the movie looking like Axel Rose and sets out to save all the hotties, and get rid of all the baddies. There's enough cheap one liners here to make a failing comic blush, and trying to prop up a bad idea with loads of scantily clad beauties is just sad.I think I'm getting old, but I would be surprised if even the American Pie loving 16-25 demographic will find this amusing.

I wanted to start this review by saying that this release, is not only great on Blu-Ray, it represents great value for money.BD disc, DVD for the car or other room, digital copy AND soundtrack, available as a download code in MP3 format (no actual soundtrack CD is included)The story of the movie is simple, and as I'm sure others have noted, mirrors today in a World where the Muppets, are old hat, forgotten, and no longer recognized.The story of getting back together for one "big" show, to raise money for the side plot, is curiously topical, as this movie in itself has launched the Muppets back from their relative obscurity.I loved the simple story, and I remember enjoying the Muppets from their beginnings, in what really is a long time ago.Over the years they morphed into Elmo, Fraggle Rock and innumerable Jim Henson exploits to keep up with the times, but Kermit and the gang were always at the heart, the original, still the best.The fairly thin plot deals with Kermit and new friends tracking down the old gang, and trying to get the show on, to stop evil oil baron Chris Cooper (who is enjoying chewing scenery every second he's on screen) from tearing down their theater and studio.A whole host of well known actors pop up in funny cameos to pad out the story, and Jack Black as the kidnapped celebrity host is a blast!It's plain fun, good songs, dance routines and sillyness, and I loved it!I suspect this movie will probably appeal more to older parents, and original fans, who will enjoy taking a whole new generation through the magical ride of the Muppets.I gave it 5 stars, clean family fun, with enough to keep the adults and kids laughing together.

My daughter is around 10 months old and this toy has really become one of her favorites. It is easily assembled, solidly constructed and very tough. A single catch converts it from a ride on to a step behind walker, and the spinning rattles and other accesories are fun as well as not easily removed. If you want a great aid to help unassisted walking this is it, and at a fraction of the cost of some other more complicated versions. I highly recommend (and so does my daughter!).

Earl Swagger is immersed in the deep south investigating Thebes Penal Farm - an all negro penal ranch, set against the backdrop of the murky 50's and racial divisions of the Southern US. Accepting that our hero is of almost superhuman prowess wears a little thin after a while, as he continually weathers horrific mistreatment at the hands of the villians, and stills comes out on top. This aspect aside, this is better than an average, and by no means dime store drivel. I am new to Mr Hunters writing and what first appeared as something of a tome at over 550 pages actually flew quite quickly, and bobs the reader along at a steady pace. Some interesting twists in the plot and excellent character development without being over descriptive more than adds to the flavor, and the end result is a pleasing read. Not one that will live in the memory for many years I felt after finishing it, but certainly worth a look, and a great vacation or travel companion. Enjoy

Probably the pick of the Jaws style thrillers that remerged a few years back, attempting to capture the suspense of the Shark flick, with more inventive special effects.The movie sports a pretty good cast, including Samuel L Jackson as a rich investor, and Saffron Burrows as the hard nosed and dedicated physician attempting to find a cure for Alzheimer's by using Shark brain fluid. Sounds cheesy, but the plot actually supports itself quite well and is at least plausible, if a little improbable. The story centers around an isolated marine facility with a skeleton crew that you just know are going to get into problems, and sure enough the picture moves quickly into an escape adventure, when the hunters (or scientists) become the hunted. Another complaint is the casting: the director seems to have felt the need to cover all the bases with stereotype characters, which really wasn't necessary.* The aging and unkempt heavy smoking scientist* The sexy young, ruthless bossy woman* The religious guy* The handsome hunky hero with a shady past* The successful financial investor, who's also athletic and a born leader* The soft spoken other female with an active but sensitive side* The brainy guy who's a bit of a wimp, but comes through in a clutchThis is no Jaws however, with none of the grace or depth of the Spielberg classic, and spends far too much time trying to wow the audience with the ferociousness of the initially caged lab experiments. After they get loose we are treated to some gory attack scenes but this is where the movie really suffers. Watching this on the small screen really shows up the CGI and at times the sharks looks so fake, they almost appear as cartoons. Lightning fast attack sequences don't help this either, and the whole thing starts to look very artificial.This isn't a BAD picture, and there are one or two twists in the plot, and scenes to make you jump which help lift the story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall.Worth a look, but you probably won't pause it while you put the popcorn on!

I saw this movie one day after it's cinematic release, and was suprised at the opening 15 minutes then (current affairs had us in the middle of the Iraq invasion), and wondering if this is the reason behind the long wait to go from screen to DVD.Del Toro plays a "Black Op's" type of military specialist, who (it later transpires) was an A student of civilian instructor Tommy Lee Jones, in the deadly art of assassination among other things. Without giving too much away, Del Toro (constantly haunted by his military past) appears to have gone off the deep end, and all suspicions point to his involvement in some brutal murders. This is a cue for Tommy Lee to be dragged from retirement as the "only man" who can find him, and ultimately hunt him down. I don't think it's too much to say that the opening sequences in this movie are harrowing, and the whole subject matter is more than a little disturbing, and please - this movie is NOT for kids, even younger teenagers. The hunter/hunted action makes up the bulk of the film, and one can't help drawing comparisons with movies like US Marshals, and The Fugitive, but this is very different, and I believe much better. Del Toro is not a "good guy" being persecuted and chased wrongly, and we aren't looking for a conspiracy theory or gang of corrupt politicians to blame, and this adds much more believability and tension to the plot. Jones is very good in this "non governmental" role and is very believable in his demonstrated expertise, but Del Toro is the real star of the picture in my mind. He is cold, calm and brooding, killing without fear or conscience, whilst still fighting his inner demons. Direction is slick and inventive, and the locations used are breathtaking. This is a very very good movie, if you can endure the extremely graphic violence, and subject matter. Enjoy

Based quite rigidly on the best selling novel by Louis L'Amour, we find Sean Connery in the lead role here complete with Scottich brogue, that sits OK despite being a dusty, rough around the edges hero. Not often seen on reruns, and I don't know why this film didn't get much exposure, as many people I know haven't seen it, or even heard of it. I'm tempted to say at this point, that this is not a movie that will live long in the memory, but don't be put off - it has a strangely compelling quality and realistic feel, and a better than average script. There a number of violent scenes, most notably the grissly demise of one of the lead characters (I won't say who) at the hands of a vicious band of Indians, and you could draw some comparisons with the content of movies like &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; although that came along several years after this. On the whole this is a good solid western, with great acting pretty much all round, the 60's film style is evident in Ms Bardot's stunning appearance throughout, despite her supposedly being in the dusty back of beyondville, but this is nothing to get too upset about. I was pleased to see this come to the DVD market, and hope it will reach the wider audience it deserves. Enjoy

Moreoften than not, this movie these days is billed as a Clint Eastwood picture, and although he is the chief supporting actor, make no mistake this is Lee Marvins vehicle, through and through. Like others I first saw this at a tender age, yet even now still find myself watching it with great affection, and humming along to great songs like "They Call the Wind Maria". The power of this picture is the flexibility of the acting, the premise is quite simple, a wandering clutch of gold panners in 1800 something Californian wilderness, set up a small town to cater to the wild proclivities of the all male population. Jean Seberg as the second wife of a travelling Mormon turns the place on it's head, and is "sold" to Lee Marvin as a legal claim, much to the chagrin of the envious locals, including his partner, played by Eastwood. There is a strange melancholy to the back story of Marvins character which is elevated by some raucous singing, almost slapstick comedy scenes, and dry humour throughout. Although catagorized as a "Musical" you never really feel that way, and it's more of a comedy/action western that just has some great music and songs. Lee Marvins drainpipe rasping actually got him a No1 record with "Wandrin Star", and Eastwood's vocal input is enjoyable, albeit quaintly misplaced. It's interesting to note that Eastwood demanded a high fee at the time for fear that these singing poppinjay parts of his character, might irreperably damage his tough man image. There are some wonderful cameos from a host of well knowns, including an Almost psychotic Ray Walston as "Mad Jack Duncan", and few will forget Lee Marvins tutoring of the young Horton Finney (Tom Ligon), in the ways of the World. Not a short picture at 166 mins but worth it - a funny, sad, uplifting and at times bittersweet good old fashioned romp through the old west, Hollywood style. Well directed, written and crammed with talent. One of my all time favorites. Enjoy!

Whirlpool own brand Water Filters, not a cheap knock off and for this price (I purchased at $56 for two with free shipping) they are very good value.Easy to change, my Whirlpool fridge like others has a warning light system, and I usually stick too it, and buy ahead of time.With a family of six, and visitors, we use a lot of water, and I gave up buying bottle or purified water ages ago, this makes the water and ice taste great straight through the door.So I'm saving money (these filters run upward of $50 each at places like Sears)and being green by keeping at least a few plastic bottles out of a landfill. No brainer really

"Back then I could fly a chopper, drive a tank, and handle million dollar machinery, now I can't hold down a job washing cars". So speaks a tearful John Rambo at the end of the first of these three memorable action flicks (although it could be a page from Ted Kotcheffs resume now). Embittered, lost and victimized by an uncaring donut munching hick sherrifs department, he goes on the rampage and is saved from a Bonnie and Clyde exit in the nick of time by Richard Crenna. For me this was the high point and best movie of the trilogy, it was fresh, raw and inventive and what followed in the next two installments was just all out testerone bathed indulgence. So why recommend the set? well it's kind of like cookies without milk if you don't, and they're a good value price. The reproduction is crisp, and the transition to DVD is tastefully graced with some nice extra's. In part two, Rambo is liberated from prison and dropped in to rescue MIA's from pinko commy subversive's (and some home grown double dealing)and then moves on to Afghanistan in part 3 to save the World from even more enemys of the free World. The acceptable twisted morality of the movies has always amazed me, in so far as the villians are painted as so heinous, as to justify ANY means to bring them to justice by our hero. As has been said many times by others, an overwhelming body count, lots of bare torso muscle flexing, die hard action, and enough ammo to make an arms dealer blush all add to the meld. More than a little outdated, but still a great homage to the action era of the 80's and early 90's, it STILL has good repeat viewability. Little grey matter needed to enjoy the fun, and ridiculously cliche ridden, but a great addition to any true action fans collection. Enjoy

This album is only available on import, and the main reason for that is because it is a professionally released "bootleg" by SRS records out of Spain. When I played it on my computer, it actually came up as labelled Live at Wembley, and considering the timeline the two concerts are identical in songs, and performance order. Unlike the Wembley album, you can hear that this is an inside arena, and the sound quality is not as good, but they are some different crowd participations, and impromptu titbits from Freddie & the Boys. My advice, if you want to hear a great Live Queen album, buy the Live at Wembley CD (or even better DVD) and leave this one alone, it's so similar it's not necessary to have both. If you are a fan however, and want to wow friends with a very hard to find Import CD (albeit unendorsed) you should be able to pick one up for around 20 Euro's on international sites, or auctions, or via an importer here in the US.

The story is set in Saigong, Vietnam in the early 50's and opens with the discovery of a murdered American (Brendan Fraser) and the subsequent questioning of English Reporter (Michael Caine) by the local French Authorities. We are then transported back to the introduction of these two characters, against the backdrop of the growing Communist unrest under the French occupation. Philip Noyce's adaptation of Graham Greene's acclaimed novel of international intrigue, meanders more than races away with the story from this point, but builds with almost intoxicating subliminal undertones, as the two main characters begin to battle for the affections of the local beautiful mistress of the aforementioned Caine.Caine in married in England, and cannot get a divorce through his wife's Catholicism, and his young mistress (played with alluring but almost innocent guile by Do Thi Hai Yen) cannot after being involved with a foreigner marry a Vietnamese man, should Caine leave the country. She begins to see the young enigmatic and outwardly gentle Fraser as a ticket out, and this three way pot boiler adds some distraction to the political plot. However, as the story unfolds, we see that our characters are not all that they appear to be, and as Caine delves deeper into the Vietnamese situation, he and Fraser become embroiled in a political cat and mouse game, the end results of which we have seen at the outset.There's something anti climactic about knowing the end before you start, but the pedigree of Greene's novel rises above that, and keeps your attention throughout the reasonable short 100 minute run time. The acting is solid all-round, particularly by Tzi Ma as Caines doting local assistant, and each character develops, and ultimately keeps us guessing until the end of the picture. Doubtful to top any best movie polls, and indeed was never in contention for accolades, but it is still well worth seeing none the less. An intelligent drama based thriller that just may surprise you. Enjoy.

This is a very well acted, solid thriller with some exemplary performances by not least Michael Caine, and will certainly keep your attention for the just short of two hours running time. We follow an elderly Frenchman and former Nazi-sympathizer during WWII, finding himself the subject of a new investigation as it transpires that the Catholic Church and members of the government helped to hide him for more than 50 years, for his role in the death of Jews during WWII. The director cleverly tries to use the framework of this investigative thriller to mirror more contemporary political and moral issues but this all gets a little lost however, in the complex morass of Wartime France, Nazi's, and the Catholic Church. I think that mainstream American audiences may lack the curiosity, or historical understanding to take an interest in a political thriller that delves into so "foreign" a topic. That aside, it certainly stacks up against other movies of the genre, and though a lesser known new release, it's certainly worth a rental.

This is classic British cinema, plenty of stiff upper lip, correctness and solid acting on display. Remembering that the production year is 1955 explains the only down side to the story which is a one sided, and often unrealistic bias toward the POW characters. The Germans are played as either likeable, or totally inept, a fairly unlikely scenario considering the pedigree of Colditz as a top notch prison, and the stringent practices of the Wehrmacht during WWII. That said, this is a "feel good" flick to a degree, showing the quiet determination of the inmates against their irascible hosts. John Mills heads up a pretty A list cast for the year, not least Eric Portman who is central to the entire movie, and plays his character Colonel Richmond with a sagacious flair. You're not going to see much action, or brutal prison scenes (once again it's 1955 remember) but there are several moments of suspense interlaced through the relatively thin plot. The picture tends to allude to, but then completely side steps the horrors of POW camps, unlike the far more polished "The Great Escape" which came some 8 years later, but the Black & White production gives a nice antiquated feel to the set design, and the 94 minute running time is about right for the material on display. There have been many books written about the events that took place at Colditz castle, not least the memoirs of Pat Reid (the real life POW portrayed by John Mills on screen) and many will bemoan the fact that there is a lot missing from the story. However, if we compare more contemporary cinema that boasts "based on true events" taglines, they invariably delve even further into the realm of poetic license, than seen here. Overall 3 stars may seem a little mean, as this is a good WWII movie, being fairly typical of the period and the plodding script however, prevents it from climbing much above average. Enjoy

I purchased this to utilize the Netflix function on my Wii, and get online for the other internet features the Wii can use.I had been using a proprietary wireless USB "Dongle" but my signal was too weak from the 2nd floor to the basement, and not good enough for streaming movies.I already had aCisco-Linksys Dual-Band Wireless-N Gaming and Video Adapterset up to connect other systems to the internet, so plugging the LAN directly into this worked a treat.The Wii recognized the connection immediately after I changed it's settings from "Wireless" to "Wired" and now streams Netflix seamlessly.Why the Wii, does not have an LAN connection, or even more annoyingly, why it doesn't have an HDMI out if it's going to use online services like Netflix is beyond me completely, so if this is your only way to get streaming movies, remember they won't be in HD, even 720p.I had read reviews about much cheaper adapters not working with the Wii at all, so didn't want to chance them, I also didn't want to pay upwards of almost $50 on some other adapters. This unit shipped with prime is pretty inexpensive and works great for a hard line LAN connection.Not much else to add really. 5 stars

My daughter is 16 months old and has had this Kitchen Unit for about 7 months. It is played with daily, bashed, pulled, even climbed on and remains intact and unscathed. I have only one minor complaint - SECURE IT! I made a whole in the back of the unit and threaded a plastic locking strap to attach it to the playard to keep it from moving too much. Otherwise I found her constantly knocking the whole unit over and getting upset. The sound effects are great (and nice and quiet too!) and there is not a day when she is not doing something with the unit. During tidy up time she learned (without prompting) to hang the kitchen utensils back on their hook, and replace the shapes in the ice maker door. It can also be used with other toys and I often find her storing other items in the small cupboards, or cooking with something else altogether. I really REALLY recommend this as a good buy - at $29.99 it's not cheap, but it was certainly money well spent as far as we are concerned, and seems simply, but very well constructed, and sure to last. EXCELLENT

I notice that some have reviewed this movie as "They don't make them like this any more" and I can only say, thank goodness they don't! You are probably aware of the story (and if not, you should be) as this is a prequel to the very succesful, and equally lengthy Gettysburg. This movie has historical accuracy and period detail overload, and I did wonder whether the armies of extra's who played in the film (most of whom belong to the actual relevant regiment historical societies) had more fun watching this movie, than general viewers. I would have loved to give this movie a better rating, but I just can't - it's long, lumbering, drawn out and what little story there is gets lost in the spectacle of it all. Another popular criticism was that for a movie dealing with slavery to have only two small talking roles for black actors is also a bit of a joke. There are a few small saving graces however, not least the excellent sombre performance of Robert Duvall, and the DVD has some nice extra's, but on the whole it's a bladder testing exercise, and history lesson docudrama that would be just at home on the Discovery channel, as the big screen. A real shame

For me this was an eagerly awaited movie outing, although I have to confess as to NOT having previously read the comics. The story is fairly straightforward - Sean Connery plays latter day Indiana Jones, Alan Quartermain (Kings Solomon's Mines)who reluctantly comes to the call of the British Empire to save the World from the "Phantom" and his army of technologically advanced goons, by leading a band of "Extraordinary Gentlemen" (including one woman), in a classic Good vs Evil scenario. His band of heroes include, Dr Jekyll (& Mr Hyde), Dorian Gray, Mina Harker, an Invisible Man, Captain Nemo, and Agent Sawyer, all with their own "special" talents to contribute to the crime busting organisation. Connery is excellent (as usual) as the lead, and the acting performances are great allround, the movie is overladen with spectacular SfX, and the story builds nicely throughout. I felt the main problem with the movie - is that it is a sad reflection on the general ignorance of literary characters of old by people today, that each member in the film in turn, has to play out a little cameo, explaining who and what they are, and share their emotional baggage with the viewer. What results is a multitude of mini subplots inside a main story, itself trying to be inventive and twisted, and ultimately coming across as a bit of a mess.It is very difficult to convey deep character development inside an essentially "tongue in cheek" romp around computer generated 1899. And although the movie never sets out to be taken seriously (consider the subject matter for a moment), it seems to try and do so, at every given opportunity. It is a little slow to get going, and then fills the viewer with anticipation, which it never really delivers on fully. Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining movie, and OK at around 1hr 50 mins, but it could have, and should have been better. Sure to be a winner at the box office, and later on DVD and Video, just don't get your hopes up too high.

A Christmas gift that was gratefully received, gave way to mild disappointment at the reproduction and sound quality on this CD. I have still rated it at 4 stars for the material, and great stuff it is too. If you are new to the Stones, or just rediscovering them, herein is a nice slice of the varied range of Mick & the Boys, from the sultry Brown Sugar, right up to the streetwise boot tapping of Undercover of Night. Oh dear though at the tinny and at times sibilant recordings - these may be remastered originals, but they should have been better with the amount of technology available today. Setting my system to a top heavy bass, dropped mid range and subtle treble was the only way that I could enjoy this without feeling it was being slaughtered, and most preset surround settings on my all in one system didn't help either. I actually still have some original vinyls that sound better, and that's a shame. Overall though, a nice package at a good price, just don't expect too much if using a small or inexpensive music system.

Without wishing to take away from the original Dracula movie starring Bela Lugosi, or the more recent Bram Stoker's Dracula adaptation, this for me is THE definitve Dracula movie. Christopher Lee's portrayal of the count is both graceful, suave, intimidating and menacing, and is only offset by Peter Cushing's masterful Van Helsing, playing his nemesis. This is the movie that brought the fairly unknown Hammer studios to a World audience, and more than set the tone, and standard, of horror movies from the 60's onward. Released in the US as the Horror of Dracula (to avoid confusion with the 1931 Lugosi classic), it's links to the Stoker novel are actually tenuous at best, and the story is pretty weak really. That said, the set design, supporting cast, and all round production are excellent, underlined with a stirring macabre musical score. At just over 80 mins, it moves very quickly, and I'm sure most modern audiences will find it remarkablt tame, but it captures the mood and feel of the genre completely. I remember watching an interview with Christopher Lee (most recently seen as Saruman in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he spoke with great affection about the role of Dracula (a role he reprised in several sequels). The main reason for this was delivering the horror story in it's purest fantastical and mythical form. No matter how scared the audience became, they took comfort from the fantasy of it all. I for one would much rather see this kind of graceful suspense than watch a maniac serial killer hacking up innocent victims, I see enough of that on the news!. Great movie classic, and MUST SEE for any true horror fans. Enjoy!

Basically The Fast & The Furious on 2 wheels with ICE cube and some young hunky newcomer in a cat & mouse good guy, bad guy kind of yarn. Some totally ridiculous Motorcycle stunts that look as if the director has watched the Matrix trilogy too much. Plenty of hot babes and even hotter bikes and a whisper thin plot carefully woven between the leather clad opposing tribes. Sure to appeal to the 18-24 demographic, but leave the "is that really possible" sensibility at home.

Fans of John Woo might want to check this out - one of his first pictures he actually made with an American production company, it was pretty unfairly hammered by critics when released. You will see many of his trademark action sequences herein, and the storyline is actually pretty good. Van Damme actually takes a bit of a step up here from his usual action formula, and creates a good character role. My only criticism about this movie would be the frequent slow motion shots of Van Damme in posing mode, complete with permed shoulder length hair. Other than this minor flaw the film is very good. Lance Henriksen is delicious as the baddy leader of a high paying clientele of human hunters, and give our erstwhile hero and his female companion here an enjoyable cat and mouse game of suspense. The fight choreography is outstanding, and the action comes thick and fast. By no means intellectually gripping, but good escapism - even if it is a tad on the violent side.

This is actually a well plotted above average teen horror flick from director Victor Salva(most recently seen in the drama film Powder)The first 20 minutes or so of this movie are truly tense and quite scary as we find a young brother &amp; sister travelling home for spring break in an old car. As they drive along in a more than deserted part of the countryside, they witness a macabre looking stranger doing something they can't quite believe after a near miss on the highway, and quickly begin to fear for their own safety. Without divulging too much of the storyline, the picture gathers pace from this point and more than cleverly keeps up the tension without falling into the usual gratuitous gore or fantastical scenes. Fans of this type of movie will certainly find plenty to enjoy, although the power of the movie is placed much more firmly in the psychological aspect, than the more common &quot;in your face&quot; horror, in fact there are even one or two references to the horror movie genre by the stars themselves, woven nicely into the script. The two main characters are played with huge credibility by the relative newcomers Gina Phillips and Justin Long, who are probably remembered for their recent outings in films like of Telling You &amp; the very different Galaxy Quest respectively. Their portrayal of two very scared youngsters comes across well, and puts the viewer, easily into their situations. My only complaint about the movie would be the directors insistence on incorporating a fantastic element eventually into the direction, in an attempt to follow a supernatural theme. This works OK, but one has to say or more believable or credible explanation of the events we are seeing, would have been even better.The movie has something of a low budget feel, but this is not in any way detrimental to the story, and almost adds something to the feeling of isolation in the locations depicted. All this said, this is a very well made movie with more than a few suprises along the way, and an ending that is certainly not &quot;out of the box&quot;. There are several short scenes of gory violence, but not too much to warrant an R rating otherwise. Enjoy.

I purchased this book, without having any background in programming in any computer language, except a small amount of Basic &amp; HTML, hoping for fast results. The truth is that although the book is comprehensive and user friendly, it relys heavily on a pre existing knowledge of the subject matter and is really NOT for the absolute beginner. My only other observation would be the constant &quot;I'll cover that part later&quot; aspect of the text, which is very frustrating, and makes the reader want to skip ahead to consolidate learning. I would certainly recommend this book, but only as an addition to the library of someone who knew a great deal about Delphi first, without which 21 days is optomistic at best!

I'll start by saying I enjoyed this movie, a lot - and it's refreshing to see a new approach to the mythical story than simply rechurning old material as others have done. If you are a fan of the excellent "Excalibur" or have even read Le Morte d'Arthur by Sir Thomas Mallory, then your first reaction to this movie will be "What the ?". That said, I have admiration for a director who dares tread unbroken ground in such a way, and tries to express that stories of old, handed down over the years were probably based on some kind of actual events initially, and this is the premise here. Clive Owen, is a little too workmanlike for my taste as the Revered Knight "Arturious" nee Arthur of the title, born to mixed parents, half English, Half Roman who has spent the last fifteen years of his adult life, roaming England, and fighting heathens in the name of the holy church of Rome. On the eve of his release from Religious servitude, he and his band of hardened knights are sent on a pseudo suicide mission North, to rescue a young boy who may become the next Holy Pope. During his journey, he is awakened to the corruption of the Church, a revelation that rocks the very foundation of all he has held dear all his life. He begins to see his own countrymen (formerly his enemies) as kindred spirits almost, and unites them ultimately to ward off a huge army of Saxon invaders. It's a nice idea, and a nice twist with some inventive back story along the way. Launcelot is here, Gawain, Galahad, Guinevere, and even Merlin as a mystic Celtic style witch doctor, all adding meat to the bones of the legend. The trouble is, the movie tries to encapsulate the legend of the mighty Arthur, and really only serves up a slice or two in an almost episodic retelling. The historical timing and influences of the Roman prescence in the England depicted are credible, and the battle scenes are graphic and impressive, but something always seems missing as you watch. My favorite character was the Saxon King Cerdic played with a battle weary but ruthless malevolence by Stellan Skarsgrd, who adds more than just balance to the whole picture, and will make you hiss every time he appears almost. Overall not bad, it's worth getting this unrated Directors cut however, as the additional footage makes for a better movie, and the alternate ending is the one that should have been used, instead of the schmaltzy Hollywood one shown. Very enjoyable movie that is almost believable in places, but one wonders if it would have been better as a stand alone story, instead of trying to be the Story behind the story of the legend of Arthur.

I used to enjoy watching this on daytime TV, although I always felt that it was plagued with commercial breaks, and always too short.Byron is a great "middle man" rather than a host, and spins (what I consider pre determined) topical stories and current affairs from the news, media and entertainment world, for the guest comics to pick apart and place their own humorous slant on.That's the show pretty much in a nutshell, however this set has such a great collection of well known entertainers, you don't easily tire from the quick fire humor. At 173 minutes on two discs there is probably too much for a single sitting, and for best results (and too prevent the show feeling repetetive) one should probably watch this in installments. Like most comic material today the humor is more "observational" than "did you hear the one about..." but nonetheless there is a barrel of laughs here. Byron is funny, and witty, but never forgets that the guests are the stars here, and doesn't use the show as a personal vehicle in the way that say Letterman or Leno would.Good fun alround, mostly OK for older kids to sit through as well. Being topical some of the humor may got lost as the story is "old news" but watching these comics relax and "chat" is certainly worth the purchase.4 Stars for some genuinley funny moments, 1 star knocked off for lack of longevity or repeat viewing.

Spits Gunnery Sgt Tom Highway to his fellow Sgt after his initial meeting with his milketoast Platoon office Lt Ring, on his return to an active Marine unit. There is a fair amount of formula and predictability to the story here, as Eastwood plays the aforementioned Highway, old, battle scarred, wise and more than a little grizzled - charged with whipping a bunch of misfits into an elite recon unit. His senior officer hates him, his ex wife is still bitter, and he's way to close to retirement for his own comfort, but you know he will somehow triumph in the end. It's interesting to note, that shortly after it's release, it was condemned by some in the military for it's portrayal of Marines, chiefly as being top heavy on bad language, so sensitive types be warned. There's plenty of Eastwood style quips to keep most amused alongside a fairly good, if straightforward story, laced with some action along the way. For me, however the power of the film is the subplot that runs in tandem with the main story, about a lifelong military man, coming to terms with the end of his career, and reflecting on a failed marriage, as well as many other life events along the way. Although this is handled "in character" with more than a large dose of macho dialogue, there's a subtle depth to the role, that is often thought provoking, and compliments the rest of the picture very well. One minor complaint would be making the minor skirmish that was the liberation of the island of Grenada into a lavish military operation, which is a bit of a stretch. But considering that (at time of production) this was the only real topical choice for a factual based War, so to speak you can be forgiving. Probably NOT one of Eastwoods best movies by any means, but hugely enjoyable and good for more than a few repeat viewings. Enjoy!

Dennis Hopper is a mad bomber (sound familiar) planting time bombs all over San Fransisco, and the only things standing in his way are Tom Sizemore as a vengeful vice cop, and Steven Seagal as a bomb squad expert called Glass! What Sizemore was doing associating himself with this brainless drivel is anyone's guess, but it is a pretty poor outing, even by Seagals recent standards. Interestingly this had a delayed release due to sensitivity around 9-11, but any expectations you mave have knowing that will soon evaporate. Trivia fans might look out for Seagal playing a disguised member of the live band in the "Jazz Cat" bar scene (nothing to do with the plot) as this is probably the high point of the flick. I think the script was doodled on some rough paper in a toilet somewhere, and in sure fire hollywood fashion somebody said "Great idea for a movie". On the plus side there is quite a bit of action, although Seagal is even more miserably stoic than usual, and you can't help feeling everyone is going through the motions, just to get a pay check. One diversion from the normal formula has Sizemore and NOT Seagal as the "man with attitude" after his family were wiped out by, you guessed it ......... a bomb. The credibility meter is in sub overdrive, and there are more cliches in this picture than explosions, so don't be too disappointed. Even the class of Dennis Hopper can't lift this out of mediocrity, and I have to advise even the staunchest of Seagal fans to to avoid this movie. Worse than Bad!

It's one thing to suspend disbelief, it's another when disbelief gets up, calls a cab to the airport and flees to South America for a few months!That however is what is necessary if you intend to enjoy this movie on any real level.I find it hard to believe that even the most ardent popcorn munching, eye candy junkie with their brain completely in neutral won't be shaking their head.Even the distraction of a smoldering Angeline Jolie, a pumped James McAvoy and gratuitous violence out the wazoo, can't make up for completely (and I mean not even at a stretch in a parallel universe kind of completely) unbelievable character antics.I know already that this review will get panned as the box office figures don't bear out my humble opinion; I just ask that if you are considering buying this movie, RENT it first!The movie opens with David O'Hara (Doomsday) running along a top floor corridor (as he sends his heart rate over 400 beats per minute with pinpoint control) launches himself out through the 50th floor window (the window is closed by the way), leaps about 200 feet horizontally through the air amidst the shattered glass (he loses no height), simultaneously draws his weapons and kills several assassins on the building opposite, before landing safely on his feet.He, himself is then promptly dispatched by a sniper shooting a handmade self guiding bullet from about two miles away, through several objects before striking it's target with perfect precision.If you think that all sounds rather silly, well it goes downhill from there.Bending bullets, secret weavers reading spun thread to get names to assassinate people, Morgan Freeman (clearly in this for a paycheck only) stunts too dire even for blue screen Sfx, and a plot thinner than dime store toilet paper, and you should know what you're in for.If you want to see an great, believable and taut thriller about real marksman, rent or buy the excellent "Shooter" with Mark Wahlberg.This movie I suppose is sure to be popular with the 16-23 crowd, but even they will probably need to be smoking whatever the director was, to become detached enough to enjoy this.

Whether you are a fan, or not even familiar with the music of Lonnie Donegan, or Skiffle in general, this is a great introductory album. Unfortunately only available as an import, this will probably remain a &quot;speciality&quot; item which is a real shame. My only complaint would be that this repackaged collection of 19 of his best known hits, can get a little repetitious as many of the songs are similar in length and chord arrangements, but the strangely upbeat folk / blues / pop overtones rapidly become infectious. Those thinking of taking a chance on ordering should know that even with 19 tracks on board, running time is not that long, as most of the tunes are 3 minutes or less (as was the way back then I presume). However, if you want to hear some of the music that helped inspire the Beatles, as well as a host of other great British bands (arguably)you will enjoy this collection. I gave it 4 stars which is a little generous, but you will fiend that virtually every top 20 hit he had is on here, although I know there were many other recordings of concert and session material. Overall worth the money though, take a chance - you may enjoy it!

Not having read the bestselling book on which the movie is based, I felt I would be at a disadvantage, but was more than pleasantly surprised, and absorbed by this movie. Joe Simpson and Simon Yates narrate whilst actors reenact their almost disastrous but succesful climb of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, and the amazing events that unfolded during their descent. I won't dwell on the story (which has been told almost in entirety in other reviews), as watching the actual living mountaineers recount the story, obviously brings an inevitability to the final outcome. All that said, the camera work and Widescreen presentation is nothing short of breathtaking, showing the mountain, and the mountain range in all its beautiful and treacherous majesty. The true story of probably the most single minded, and amazing will to live saga of Joe Simpson after a fall shattered his leg, and was cut loose by his partner in an attempt to save them both is harrowing, compelling and will stay with you for a long time. The intercutting of the narration with the dramatic feel of the reenactment on screen gives a real emotion, and tension to the story despite knowing all ended well ultimately, and is a refreshing approach to film making. There are also some featurettes on the DVD, including a return to the mountain some 17 years later by the two climbers who helped with the filming, which adds another dimension to the film itself. This is NOT a hollywood escapade, or "Vertical Limt" nailbiter, but a sober and utterly dramatic piece of cinema, that even if you know nothing about Mountaineering is great viewing. You empathize almost with the peril and danger, and even though you know that these young men were here by choice, some might even say foolishly so, you get swept into the story completely. It's interesting to note that the mountain has NEVER been succesfully climbed since, a lesson for all perhaps?. 4.5 Stars. Enjoy

As others have noted, both this and "Wake of Death" have shown a change in direction for Van Damme, choosing to delve more into complex roles, drama, and believable acting, rather than two dimensional fight movies. Not that I suspect we will be seeing him on the nomination list at the Oscars any time soon, but here again he turns in a credible performance. After being jailed for avenging his wifes murder, he is subjected to a brutal Eastern Block prison regime, where the dollar rules, the guards and warden are corrupt, and you sleep with one eye open. We see the gradual deterioration of an outwardly "normal" man, whose only means of survival is to become one of the cruel and violent inmates he has come to despise. The fight sequences are short, snappy, brutal and bloody (no box splits, or flying spinning back kicks here) and the viewer is immersed into the savage world of gangs, violence, and desperation. "In Hell" is an apt title, but the film has some surprising twists, and different outcome to what one might expect, and is well directed and well scripted throughout. Hardly an original story, but the European makeover adds another dimension to a standard prison flick of say "Lock Up" or many others. On the whole, I recommend this movie, and hope to see Van Damme continue to develop his characters in this way. I've always enjoyed his other, and often more aimless fight movies so felt a teeny bit agrieved at the lack of martial arts, but overall the movie is pretty darn good. Enjoy!

Ben affleck and Uma Thurman star is John Woo's latest offering. Mr. Affleck has had his memory erased, but knowing this was likely to happen left himself 13 clues to help him reclaim his life, get the girl, kill all the baddies and ride fast on a motorcycle. Plenty of two gun unlimited magazine style action, and actually looks quite good, despite Mr. Woo's penchant for "SfX Overload" and "lets use more ammo than the A team" style of direction. A little better than most mindless action movies, one or two twists, but even the most indifferent viewer should have figured it all out way before the end.

I have never subscribed to the movie maxim that a great director makes for a great movie, but here it was never more true. Sydney Pollacks political thriller set inside the United Nations is a masterful pot boiler full of suspense, credible plot lines and directed with a masterful even handedness that is never overbearing. Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broom, a multi lingual translator working in the UN in New York, who overhears a plot to assassinate the dictatorial leader of Matobo (a war torn and divided African State). She is summarily placed under the protection of the Secret Service in the form of Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), an action that actually heightnes the nightmare into which she has become immersed, and the intrigue and suspense begins to build in even layers. Both Kidman and Penns characters are intertwined as they each deal with their own recent personal losses, but Pollack deliberatley steers away from a formula pattern of attraction, instead delving deep into character development and a great storyline. Is Kidman a target? a victim? or even a suspect? we find ourselves asking as the story unfolds. The two begin to play a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they head to stop a potential international crisis. There are some dramatic sequences, and thought provoking side comment along the way, giving the whole picture a complete and professional feel seldom seen in other films of the genre. The movie itself was groundbreaking as it is actually filmed inside the UN (the first time this has ever been done), but this is just an interesting caveat to a great movie. Pollack himself pops up for a small but believable cameo (as he seems to do in most of his movies) but he takes a back seat to some top class acting, chiefly from Kidman and Penn in the lead roles. The early 2005 release will probably preclude an Oscar nod for next year, but this is right up there, and represents some of Pollacks best work, of the calibre of Three Days of the Condor, and The Firm to name just two. One or two very minor inconsistencies and flaws I felt personally, kept me from giving this 5 stars, but make no mistake, this is an excellent movie from all angles. Enjoy!

This early outing finds Wayne in a romantic, light hearted story that showed early signs of what was to come. Watch closely to see early parallels with later legendary performances with Maureen O'Hara in films such as the quiet man. Only about 100 mins long, but very easy viewing, and absorbing, don't be put off by the early year of production - this is a very good movie.

The transition from original recordings to digital is crisp and clear, if a little sibilant, and really dramatizes Jim's wondeful balladeering. The Blizzard remains endearingly haunting in it's simple, but powerful story telling, and no collection would be complete without &quot;He'll have to Go&quot;. Unfortunately though, however good this album is, it is annoyingly short, how an album can be packaged as &quot;best of&quot; with only 8 tracks! and a total playing time of under 30 minutes tends to leave you feeling sold short and wanting more. The truth is that there are equally good albums available with many more of Jims multitude of hits and great ballads, and though they may lack a little in sound quality, they are much better value for money.

At almost 20 years old now, this award winning series still represents the finer aspects of great British comedy. Set in the 80's in which it was made, it satirically mirrors the politics of the era with a wry and subtle genius that is a joy to behold. All that said, a little familiarity with British politics, or the British culture in general helps tremendously. I am not surprised at the success of this series here in the States, but the uninitiated viewer may be being sold a little short on the finer aspects of the characters, and the dry humor. Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) is the central character (following on from the Yes Minister series) thrust almost unwittingly into the limelight of the Prime Ministerial race, and sets about running the country with the same graceful ineptitude he applied to his previous ministerial post in the deparment of administrative affairs. Nigel Hawthorne is masterful as "Sir Humphrey" his "advisor" and head of the civil service who has his own agenda throughout, and plays all sides against the middle with varying levels of success. The final main Character is Hackers private secretary Bernard (Derek Fowlds) who often naively walks a middle line between helping the PM, but always being aware of his own allegiances to Humphrey (being a civil servant himself). This set begins with Hackers rise to power, and then contains all the subsequent episodes where the three characters play out some hilarious, and often thought provokingly satirical situations in a balanced and polished collection. Being a topically based political comedy obviously has its pitfalls, and those too young to remember the "Thatcher" years of British government, soviet spies, and the peaks and troughs of the economy during the 80's may view this a somewhat bland. I'm not suggesting for one minute that ANY viewer would not find great comedy in watching this collection, but it has to be said that it will almost certainly appeal to a narrower audience ultimately. Lots of extra's on the DVD collection and BBC video are to be congratulated on the excellent picture and sound quality of the presentation. Maybe not a "timeless" comedy, but a brilliant one none the less. Enjoy!

As others have said, this film is not a comedy, nor is it in anyway a show (like the brilliant, &quot;I'm telling you for the last time&quot;) and even if you love Jerry's material immensely, you could be forgiven for feeling a little misled.It is a very good documentary on what it takes to make it as a comedian in a very unforgiving and competetive business, and really is a film of two halves. We follow Jerry in one half of the movie as he retraces his roots, and attempts in a very short space of time to go back and work up from 10 minute Club routines, all the way to an hour long performance with completely new material. The other half of the movie has another up and coming (we think) comedian Orny Adams, and his struggles and pressures as he trys to make the big time. Unfortunately for me, despite the real &quot;fly on the wall&quot; direction, I found myself really not caring about the young Mr Adams, who appears rude, spoiled, arrogant, self absorbed and completely neurotic, and began to wonder why half the movie was dedicated to him, when the title on the box says - Jerry Seinfeld Comedian. In fact, to prove this point, one of the &quot;extra's&quot; is a short piece entitled &quot;Where is Orny Now?&quot; - considering this film was made over a year ago, and I'd never heard of him before watching, I guess you can figure out the answer.The DVD has some saving graces however, with a couple of worthy deleted scenes, movie trailers, a good commentary selection plus the Letterman performances by both of the movie stars, amongst other things. However, sadly the whole thing get's a little numbing, and although I really wanted to rate this movie better,I couldn't. Truth is, most people will buy this hoping to see Jerry and his material, and then find as I did the very frustrating habit it has of cutting from scene to scene, just as you are beginning to actually see or hear his material. I found the other comedians shown to be weak for the most part (especially Mr Adams)and tried to savor the odd glimpses of very funny material, making the best of a bad hand, so to speak. Enjoy the movie, but don't expect too many laughs.

Pierce Brosnan is back in his 4th outing as the tuxedo clad suave English spy, and looks set to have sealed his name in connection with Bond, in almost Sean Connery fashion.Heavily SfX laden action sequences break up the usual one liners, and witty inuendo but this time, for a change there seems to be a real underlying tenacity and gritty toughness to the Bond character. The opening 5 minutes is almost brutal (and a little different in style compared to the usual openings) albeit a tiny bit annoying being overladen with the titles, but apart from that is extremely enjoyable.A big problem with all Bond movies, is the comparison factor to those that went before, and although Brosnan is definiteley the right man, the plots seem to be relying heavily on older movies. In this outing James must save the World (again) from a madman who is using diamonds, to build a super space laser weapon, to eliminate the free world - sound familiar? Well yes it does, and the story is more than a little similar to Diamonds are Forever.The next minor criticism would be the high tech gadgets, which are always usually pleasing (if a touch incredible), I found an Aston Martin that becomes invisible, something of a stretch and if one looks back, the really succesful movies in the series have not relied too heavily on high tech, or made them too fantastic. These minor grumbles aside, strap yourself in for plenty of action, high jinks, and good solid acting performances all round. Haley Berry is particularly fetching, and the latest bond girl (who has a brain as well as a body) adding much to the script and story.The real measure of this movie is it's undoubted success had it NOT been a Bond movie, one feels that if the lead character had been Harold Smith instead of James Bond, the story and production would still have been great, and very watchable, even if the razzmattaz associated with it's release, would have been probably non existent. Let's hope the super spy keeps going for another 20 movies. Enjoy !!!

George Lucas's much awaited and anticipated "filler" Episode III is the movie that (arguably) most fans have been waiting to see the most, to see just how Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) will become Darth Vader etc etc etc. The movie opens in the midst of a huge star battle with Anakin and ObiWan (Ewan McGregor) attempting to rescue Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the evil clutches of Count Dooku, and General Grievous (a sort of droid with one or two internal organs), and never really lets up in pace or impressive visuals throughout. For those who have followed the story, this begins 3 years after the last movie and sets about filling in all the holes between then, and the emergence of Luke Skywalker in the original picture, and does so very well, in my opinion. The strength of the movie lies not only in the visuals, but Lucas's uncanny knack of holding your attention throughout the movie, when you already really know the ending (assuming you have seen the original Star Wars picture) or where it is heading at least. It's the journey from A to B that absorbs you, and is enthralling and entertaining, even if it feels a little hurried during the last 20 minutes or so of the story.This is a dark movie however, with hardly any moments of levity as so often welcome in the other movies in the series, and deals with the insidious and beguiling evil of Senator Palpatine, turning the young impressionable Jedi from good to Evil. I'm not going to go into the story any more than that really, as it will be undoubtedly covered in many reviews and websites. Speaking of reviews, it's had a mixed reception with the media, and criticized for some stilted acting, and lack of passion in some areas. Christensen may not be believable enough in tender moments opposite his secret wife Padme (Natalie Portman), but he more than makes up for this in other areas, particularly in one rather distressing scene (cleverly alluded to off camera) where he is seen to pass the point of no return on his path to the dark side. On the whole I found this to be a great movie, with lots of action, a tight script, and some good acting, particularly from McGregor and McDiarmid. Yes it has some problems, and one or two areas where I felt even the seamless CGI was top-heavy, particularly in the light saber battles. But overall this is head and shoulders above the last two movies, and time will judge as to its success and appeal when compared to the original picture now over 25 years old. One or two scenes may distress very young children, but other than that this is a good family movie, which like the final Lord of the Rings movie, has now heralded sadly, the end of an era

Nearly 10 years on, this Spielberg classic is rivalled only by Jaws for originality, tension, and superb performances. Richard Attenborough plays the stoic billionaire who has discovered how to extract dinosaur DNA from a mosquito fossilised in tree amber, and decides to bankroll a genetics created theme park to wow the World. As always, with these schemes, you should listen to the age old maxim "Don't mess with Mother Nature" and despite the remote Island Location, the huge Reptiles get loose, and go on the rampage. This was the first and definitely best in the series of 3 movies, and I almost wish they'd stopped here, where the trilogy arguably peaked. Wonderfully realistic CGI blends seamlessly with superb acting performances from Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum (to name but a few). The best thing about this picture is it's longevity however. Like "Jaws" it is a non topical and timeless adventure for the whole family (with the exception of very small children). It's gripping, and often scary without being offensive or gratuitous and will undoubtedly be rediscovered by each succesive generation of viewers. Deservedly hailed now as a classic piece of Cinema. A great movie at a great price. Enjoy!

I have to disagree with those who have bemoaned this picture for failing to fulfill genre requirements, as these people have obviously missed the point. Basic is NOT an action movie, nor is it really a murder mystery, it is not a romantic thriller, a war movie, or even a courtroom drama, and that is WHY it is so entertaining. The mere fact that it can't be pidgeonholed into a movie &quot;catagory&quot; or &quot;genre&quot; is the genius behind the direction, and I have to say probably one of John McTiernan's better movies to date. I'm not going to give anything away, except to say, this is a real potboiler, a whodunnit, and a dark sided movie all rolled into one. You will be compelled and find yourself guessing throughout the multiple twists, turns, and double backs that seem to be endlessly thrown into the mix. Probably not a movie to buy (once you know how it ends) and that's why I kept it to 4 stars, but don't be fooled by the trailers. This picture is slick, inventive, and totally absorbing. The performances are strong, and believable all round, and the storyline develops at an even pace, keeping you hooked. Who will you believe? and why? you will constantly be asking yourself until the final credits roll. A really good nailbiter - Enjoy!

I received this book in hard cover format as a gift, being a fan of the show and stand up performances, and enjoyed it tremendously. That having been said, it is a not much more than a light reading experience, and at under 200 pages (mostly lightly filled) is little more than a mirror of his most well known material. Fans like myself will not be disappointed, but this is not an insightful expose of what makes Jerry tick, and moreover is really just selling ice to eskimos. Good fun, but don't expect too much

Having just bought, and reviewed, the most recent (and unquestionably better) version of the Marvel character adaptation, I thought I'd revisit this 80's action yarn, and say a few words. Which is about all you can say - Dolph Lundgren is even more wooden than usual, having been saved from Death by Louis Gosset, who I can only assume was flat broke, to have even wanted to be associated with this garbage. It's bad, I mean real bad - the plot is all over the place, with virtually no references to the comic book story. Scenes begin with no explanation whatsoever, and usually end in an enormous explosion. The Punisher has a weakness it seems, (aside from inability to act) and gets badly bloodied and beaten in a fist fight. But this is only a minor setback, as when faced with an army of machine gun toting goons he of course emerges completely unscathed. This is a cheap action flick of the type that were turned out by the 80's macho grist mill almost every week it seemed, and although some were good - this is one you'll want to forget in a hurry. Everything about it is says cheap and poorly finished, from characters to set design, and as for hiding out by riding around the sewers on a Harley that's loud enough to wake the dead - gimme a break! Average by Lundgrens standards, which is of course, not much of a recommendation - give this one a miss and catch the new one instead - you'll be glad you did.

I did not see this movie at the theater, so may have lost some of it's impact on the small screen, but overall found it very enjoyable, if at times, very violent.Any movie over over two and a half hours long, that keeps your attention this well (and makes you feel like it was 90 minutes long) can't be all bad, but I don't rate it that highly. The rear of the box says "Over 135 critics agree - film of the year" and this I have to disagree with.Performances are strong - Lewis, who is particularly villianous, is ably supported by DeCaprio as well as a host of good cameo's and the storyline is very good. My main criticism would be weakness of DeCaprio in building his character, and the almost superfluous role of Ms Diaz as the love interest. The beginning of the movie has Liam Neeson and Lewis in a rival gang face off in old New York, arguing over the immigrant Irish Catholicism versus the American locals in extremely violent and graphically depicted fashion, which sets up the story in an excellent way. We are then transported 16 years forward to see Neeson's son (DeCaprio) emerging from a correctional home for boys, and setting about avenging his father, and rebuilding his Irish claims to residency. Unfortunately as we proceed through the movie, you can't help feeling that Neeson would have been the better man for the role, as DeCaprio just doesn't come across as believable in my mind, and looks too polished. Great direction by Scorsese, and even if it is allegorical in character, it really does give you an idea of the struggle and brutality of the early history of the great city. This is not a bad movie by any means, but it isn't a "Great" movie either. It's just become like so many that are over hyped for so long, or have been overladen with Oscars and awards - you the viewer come to expect much much more than you get. If you'd never heard of this movie and rented it out by chance, you'd probably give it 5 stars, as it is - it only gets 3 in my book.

I actually received this just after Christmas, by which time we were already knee deep in Holiday movies, but the kids love them so I thought what the heck.I gave it three stars, that may sound mean, but it's a stock Christmas movie, what else can you say.You've seen the same plot a thousand times in different forms, this time it's the dog that brings everyone together, amid much oohs and aahhs, and snuggling around the fire.Don't expect a ton of action, although there are enough canine capers, and funny moments to keep most everyone content (mostly at the extreme ends of the age scale) who like this gentle kind of stuff.Will Zeus the ex K-9 patrol dog, ever get back his bark? Will be be left homeless this Christmas? You don't need to be Einstein to figure it out.I'm not being overly critical, I mean the acting is pretty good, production doesn't look cheap, and it is the season after all. I used to bemoan these flicks a lot when I was younger, but it's actually nice to watch kids following this kind of stuff, rather than explosions, Sfx and violence for a change.

I had never seen this show (or even heard of it) despite having seen many original 60's and 70's series, and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It's warmly nostalgic to look back at some of these older shows, and the current trend of old TV DVD releases are finding a whole new audience. Some are still pretty good (I'll include Honey West in that group) some are embarassingly out of date and cringeworthy. I have not yet seen all of the 30, half hour episodes on this great value set, but what I have seen has been entertaining. Anne Francis is sexy, and more than capable as the female action star of the title, but not a bimbo, with some good material to work with, in what I presume was one of Aaron Spelling's earlier TV exploits. Thinking back to that time, this was a bold show to have an action female lead, in a time when women were generally being sent up in shows like Rowan & Martin. It's easy to see the spin offs this show must have spawned in later years, but maybe some of it's inspirations also, like Honor Blackmans "Pussy Galore" in Goldfinger 2 years earlier. The Avengers, The Champions and later shows like The New Avengers all had strong female characters, and one could arguably give credit to Anne Francis for that. Honey West was the first female character to use martial arts as self defense in a TV show, she was a karate black belt, and judo expert also. Watching also made me think of Mike Myers spoof Austin Powers movies, probably some of this show was his inspiration for those movies? John Ericson as "Sam Bolt" as the rough edge of the partnership adds enough balance, and as long as you can take the teargas earrings, and microphone lipstick you'll be fine. A few of the period details get a bit silly, the idea of owning a pet Ocelot might be artistic, but imagine trying it today. All this said, sit back and transport yourself back to a time of heroes and villians, spies and secret agents, and really bad hair and furniture. 4 Stars

This is a straightforward action / revenge flick as others have said, and if you take it as just that you will enjoy it. Far too many people are looking for intelligent social comment, or hidden morality in a movie such as this, and forget to compare it to a Steven Seagal, or even Bruce Willis style romp. Cole Hauser is a little stilted, but broody enough as the chiseled "fictional" big action movie star Bo Laramie, whose privacy is invaded, and then plastered less than gracefully (or truthfully) over the pages of the tabloids. I think the director cleverly did NOT deviate here into the "price of fame" subtext, or try and tackle the thorny issue of celebrities in the public eye, instead sticking to a straight on revenge story. Laramie we learn after he is forced to take anger management classes is something of a "good old fashioned boy" from the plains of Montana, maladjusted to the big city lights, who feels that his own moral values, and style of justice should rule the day. After 4 Paparazzi photographers hound him to the point of causing actual harm to his family, he reacts predictably, after finding little assistance from the police, or legal system. Twisted morality now please enter stage left, as the Paparazzi quartet (led by Tom Sizemore)are portrayed as unprincipled, malicious and detestable bottom feeders, whose complete lack of conscience and nefarious activities of course mean ANY form of punishment is acceptable to bring them to book. Cleverly however, what follows is not a testosterone bathed series of beatings, but a moderately inventive turning of the tables, albeit violently similar in conclusion. The viewer is ALWAYS on Laramies side, as he fumbles through the movie, and there is a good supporting cast from Dennis Farina as the "Columbo" style police officer in particular. The movie is not long at 82 minutes, but probably long enough and left me feeling almost guilty in a satifactory if predictable outcome. I believe this movie actually bombed at the box office, but this is no reflection on it being bad, and probably aimed more at Mel Gibson(making a Hitchcock style cameo appearance) in the Producers chair, who was waging his own private battle with Hollywood at the time of release. I gave it 3.5 stars which is a little generous, but still enjoyable.

You should know the story, and have probably seen this movie at least once, so I'll spare the synopsis.This was a movie made with big names, great actors, and actually very believable and realistic special effects, and sets - long before the days of computer enhancement.Even if you know how it will all end, you'll be drawn in again and again. A truly great movie, now available on DVD at an exceptional price. This movie is actually good to share with a whole new generation (small children may find the subject matter a little frightening), and holds it's own very well against more modern movies of the genre. One of the biggest and best disaster movies EVER made. Enjoy!!!

Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon play outwardly happy couple in this remake of the little known 1996 Japanese movie of the same title. Gere is stuck in a humdrum job, but is more than comfortable with a family, wife who works for Saks Fifth Avenue, two children, and house in the suburbs. Never wanting to appear ungrateful or unhappy with all he has, he is "Mr Popular" at work, but inwardly missing something in his life. During his commute home he notices Jennifer Lopez at the window of a broken down dance school each evening, until curiosity gets the better of him and he stops by to investigate. What outwardly appears at this point as a standard infidelity flick, turns into a gentle comedy as Gere enrolls in the school and finds friendship and fun with his new dance class opposites, and starts to come alive. His wife soon begins to notice his late nights and odd behaviour, as do his kids and hires a private detective to find out if he is cheating, and the story is cleverly laced with many of the elements that anyone in a long term relationship will recognise. This is a lot of fun to watch, and although maybe not intellectually stimulating, it isn't overly sentimental or sugary either. A great support cast, most notably from Stanley Tucci as Gere's quiet work colleague who is secretly a wild latin ballroom dance exponent, and a wide collection of quirky characters add fun and balance to the picture. Predictable? well yes and no, there are a few surprises along the way, some great comedy, a little depth of emotion, and overall a good balance. This is wholesome family viewing with a capital W, and the direction and script though tight are a little too far on the right side of the PC line to be quite believable, but that's my only real complaint. Gere is great, and refreshingly mature in this role, Lopez a visual distraction, and Sarandon nicely grounded as the doubting wife. Not quite 4 stars, but a great couples movie (probably older couples that is). Enjoy

Let me start by saying I enjoyed this movie, and think it is one of the better murder/mystery/whodunnit style thrillers of late. Angelie Jolie smoulders less than usual, and is believable as an FBI specialist brought in to help solve a serial killer case in Canada, after the local police chief gets nowhere. Her arrival brings some hostility from one of the local officers, but gradually she works her way to help try and solve the case. I'm not going to spoil the movie, which has one or two good twists, and several scary unexpected moments, including a truly eye popping introductory five minutes. All that said, I found the plot a little too transparent, and the target audience who have probably seen many similar movies, will probably feel the same. The Director tries to throw plenty of red herrings in the mix along the way, but most of the story was all too apparent from about 20 minutes into the picture. Sadly the necessary "weaknesses" of the otherwise stalwart female agent have to be played out, along with an obligatory sex scene, which really adds nothing - and the final part of the movie though tense, is overly contrived. Probably good for a couple of repeat viewings, despite knowing the ending, this is a good but not great effort. Some nice extra's on the DVD round out the package, and Jolie fans will probably clamour to get this in their collection. Enjoy!

Jason Statham returns to the role of Frank Martin, a professional "driver" with exceptional fighting skills, only this time he is on a routine baby sitting job for the Son of Senator Billings (Matthew Modine). In time honored fashion there is an attempt to kidnap the boy, but this is just the tip of a hair brained plot by arch villian Gianni, working freelance for Columbian drug lords. A toxic virus, drugs, money, murder and pretty much any other nefarious activity are at the top of his agenda, and the only man standing in his way is (you guessed it) Frank Martin. As usual the police, FBI et al are on the case, and totally useless, and Frank must use all his skills to save the day. That's about it really - this is NOT a movie that will test your intellect, or I suspect top any drama awards lists, but if you accept that going in, you'll have fun. The action is thick and fast, and some of the stuntwork and fight choreography under the watchful eye of the talented Cory Yuen (director of the first Transporter movie)is amazing. There is some comic relief along the way from Francois Berleand as Tarconi (the French Police chief from the last movie also) supposedly visiting Frank in Miami on vacation, and a few other familiar faces pop up in this Euro muscle flexing exercise. A lot of people have been damning of the lack of character development, often wooden supporting performances, and ridiculous aspects of some action sequences, but I would ask them "What did you expect?" - Statham carries the role very well, with a brooding but calm confidence, and arguably gives away some of the limelight to his Audi A8 W12 car, which steals many scenes in some amazing car chases. Pure escapism at it's best, Director Louis Letterier delivers Bessons script in a punchy unpretentious way and the end result certainly leaves this movie head and shoulders above similar releases, like XXX State of the Union for example. Wonderful Miami backdrops finish off the eye candy, and a psychotic, sexy she villian is also thrown in for good measure. Go on, indulge yourself and pass the popcorn. Enjoy!

My wife has a perm about once a year, and relies on good quality shampoo and conditioner to maintain the look and feel she wants. Matrix Curl.life has been a very good product and lives up to it's recommendation by most professional stylists we know. It's expensive, but when you pay a lot for a hair treatment you want it to last. The Contour milk is her favorite. It's a supplement to the shampoo and conditioner, and it goes on quickly and easy for an extra bounce, or that just curled look without feeling heavy or sticky. My only two complaints - Can we buy it in bigger containers please? and how about another fragrance other than Watermelon? 4 Stars

This really is a wonderful album. When one considers that Reba has been around since the mid seventies (albeit initially unsuccesfully) this is a searing indictment to her ability to constantly adapt her talents. This album delivers a great compilation of soul, warm and tender ballads, and upbeat dance tunes - whilst remaining throughout unmistakingly Reba.

With the dank and drab backcloth of London almost as gray as the title character, I had seen the trailers for this 2009 remake and was excited, yet skeptical that it would not hold up to the originalThe Picture of Dorian GrayI didn't doubt that Ben Barnes would make a great Dorian but knew that (at least for me) no one would be close to the excellent George Sanders as Sir Henry "Harry" Wooton, the hedonistic and outspoken mentor who inevitably leads to Dorian's downfall.However, I was very pleased with the modern retake, made more graphic for a modern audience of course, but still suspenseful and dark. Colin Firth did not disappoint me as Sir Harry also, not a patch on Sanders of course, but an admirable and believable job.For those unfamiliar with Oscar Wilde's ONLY novel, it's a simple but great almost Faustian tale.A young man of great beauty and charm wishes that a recently commissioned painting by his friend Basil Hallward, should age instead of himself, leaving him forever young and able to relish everything pleasurable in life.In the original the wish is made in front of a statue of an Egyptian God cat, and Dorian is warned about making flippant wishes in it's company.In this version (much like the book) Gray pledges to sell his soul or "nail it to the Devils alter" and soon thereafter the painting begins to exhibit signs of aging, where he does not.This version is a little closer to the book, the initial love interest Sybil is an actress in a small theater performing Shakepeare, not a singer in an East end tavern (as Angela Lansbury portrayed in the original) and other aspects here are lifted almost word for word, from the book.It's quite graphic of course (being 2009) - whereas the original black & white hinted at Mr Grays immoral behavior, this version gives it to you full in the face, but not in a gratuitous way, it adds weight to the character, as we watch his slow descent from innocence and purity to, debauchery and murder.I won't give the movie away, for those who don't know it, but it's a great story.To some the movie may be a little slow, but I loved the slow burn feel to the script and screenplay, little hints of the malice and cruelty that have warped Dorians soul in the painting are hinted, or creepily glimpsed, without giving away the climax of the movie.I am however curious as to why this has not had a US release? There is only in fact a TBA on a release date if you research it. That's a shame, considering the amount of movies released here, a film of this quality with an exceptional cast should not have been overlooked.Overall I gave 4 stars, for a great remake. Even if a remake wasn't needed.

When I first listened to this CD I was reminded of everything I hated about Country Music, back when &quot;twang was the thang&quot; and all songs promoted feelings of suicide. However, this album walks a great middle line between &quot;classic country&quot;, and &quot;new American music&quot; - and I have to say does so very well. From the cow call balladeering of Blue Angel to a masterful cover of You have to stand for something. This is the kind of music you can play loud or incidental, a good all round album, with something for everyone. Sadly most New Country in England is unavailable or overpriced unless it is deemed mainstream. This Album is a great introduction to Aaron's extensive vocal and musical range, standing shoulder to shoulder with many of todays other artists, and deserves a wider audience.

With it's swathe of gutteral and raw vocals, thrash guitar solo's and fastlane tempo, this album really captured the spirit of the Punk Rock era. One of the very few bands from the US to hit the punk scene, the album reflects many of the political and domestic struggles of the early eighties. The song mix is just about right, and coming before the infamous &quot;Too Drunk&quot; era, had cutting edge lyrics, and biting satire. Unfortunately, a lot of the content will probably be lost on an audience 20 years on but for those who remember the pogo, loud music your parents hated and in your face performances, this is the album to get. Jello Biafra heads up a great vocal performance, and the track listing shows an artful direction. Not just loud for the sake of it, as so many of their contemporarys were, the DK's really were a great band, and this is without doubt, their best work.

I don't know if this movie would have come across better in the theater, but I was more than a little disappointed after seeing several trailers and teasers before the movie.Tom Hanks plays a professional &quot;Hitman&quot; and beloved &quot;right hand&quot; of Mobster boss, played (with more than a little panache) by Paul Newman, in the depression era. When his son stows away and witnesses Hanks making a &quot;hit&quot;, and unwittingly becomes an eye witness to Murder, Newman turns on him (Hanks) and sets out to murder his family for the sake of &quot;loose talk&quot; possibly leading to a police investigation. The director sadly, has spent so much time building this depressing, grey and rain soaked backdrop to the movie, that it actually precludes the story from really coming across. Even fans of this kind of dark and brooding mobster style film, will find it implausible for the most part, and even great cinematics cannot unfortunately save it. You the viewer end up frustrated waiting for the story to gather momentum, but it seems to just stagnate, and plod along until the end, which itself is not particularly noteworthy. At just under 2 hours in length, it's also a bit of a trial to endure, and I found myself clock watching on more than one occasion. I don't want to overcritize this picture too much, and Hanks fans will probably enjoy this step away from his usual material, but this is not in the league of the Godfather, or even The Untouchables, I'm sad to say.

Like others I have used many strings over the years, and have to place these up there with the best of them.Gone are the days sadly when I used to go through strings frequently, so for at home use they're a little light for my taste.That said, they're not bright sounding or tinny, but have a nice resonance and warmth like an Ernie Ball or GHS.I gave them 5 stars, for the price they're unbeatable

After the opening 5 minutes of this movie I began to fear the worst, as the director seemed to need to rely on images of visual gore, rather than the macabre in grabbing the viewers attention. What follows however is pleasantly suprising, and has a great deal of well directed suspense, and scary moments.A seasoned crew of salvage experts (led by Gabrielle Berne) are approached by a young reporter who claims to have found a missing ocean liner (hinted as a contemporary Mary Celeste) and are immediately interested from a financial standpoint.Once the vessel is found and they are aboard they begin having strange encounters with the ships previous inhabitants (now the Ghosts of the title) and start to rapidly believe they should not have taken the job. The script moves up a notch or two at this point, and really keeps you guessing as to what is going on - one or two &quot;jump&quot; scenes are woven in to the story as it moves towards it's climax and the ending is very cleverly (and unexpectedly)suspenseful, leaving the hairs standing on the back of your neck. Not for everyone, and some of the schlock moments are more than a little graphic, but very polished and well made movie. Enjoy

The movie is played out against the backdrop of the LA riots in the early 90's, following the Rodney King trial, and centers around the corruption and nefarious activities of an elite police unit. Kurt Russell plays the son of a son of a son of a cop, who's legacy has always been shoot, beat or kill first and ask question afterwards. We see how over time he has almost unwittingly become buried under a veil of corruption, which he now cannot seem to dig his way out of. Dealing with inter department investigations, a new naive partner, and a failed marriage all add up to cause a constant self battle which is ultimately self destructive. Russell is actually very good, and the movie on the whole is enjoyable. Unfortunately, even the most innattentive viewer will have figured out how this movie will end after about only 20 minutes. It is a good script, but there is no real tension. The sleeve says "Will have you on the edge of your seat" which is sadly not true, the viewer never really cares about the characters, and one never feels drawn in or involved enough to really care about the outcome. One for a rainy afternoon only.

OK, Steve Martin is a funny guy, and has made some good comedys over the last few years, he's also made some howlers and one suspects that his material choices are cause for the blame. Here is a classic example of a bad idea, you shouldn't fix what isn't broken even if your trying to bring a cult classic to a whole new audience. The main problem is not that the character, is bigger than the actor, rather that the character WAS the actor, and watching Steve Martin, trying to play Sellers, playing Clouseau is a mess. Using the idea that this is a prequel doesn't do him any favors either. A Shot in the Dark introduced Sellers as Clouseau back in 1964, in arguably one of his funniest turnouts, alongside his long suffering boss Dreyfuss (the inimitable Herbert Lom) and a superbly dry supporting role by the late George Sanders. Here Martin relies way to much on some very ridiculous sight gags, and struggles with some awful dialogue as he attempts to recover the famous "Pink Panther" diamond, stolen during a football game at the beginning of the movie. His sidekick Ponton played by the always pleasing Jean Reno attempts to mirror the Bert Kwok character of Cato, only without any of the bumbling pathos of the originals, and even Kevin Kline playing Dreyfuss, can't lift this picture out of mediocrity. One has to tip their hat to Martin et al, for taking on a remake of sorts where the bar had been previously set so high, but wonders if an allegorical character based pastiche would have been more appropriate. The movie has some funny moments, but overall is a real let down. I had expected it to be OK but no where near as good as the original, but even going in with this pragmatic approach, I was left disappointed. A real shame.

If you haven't seen this movie, it represents one (if not THE) best of Sergio Leones &quot;Spaghetti&quot; westerns. At a hair under 3 hours, this is also up there with the likes of Once Upon a Time in the West (also by Leone) but moves with considerably more flow, and I think is a better script, story and movie overall. Clint plays the &quot;Man with no name&quot; a drifting, quick drawing hombre with a mean streak a mile wide, and tenacity to match and is the &quot;Good&quot; as referred to in the title. The story centers around gold buried in a cemetary, and is something of a multi subplotted journey to find it. Supported ably by Lee Van Cleef, and excellently by Eli Wallach as the unkempt and greedy &quot;Ugly&quot; part of the trio, this is a classic western in all senses. Sweeping vista's, bar room brawls, gunfights, hangings, and even a brief stop off in a War on the way. But the movie never plods, and any stale moments are usually livened up with some of Eli Wallachs comic relief (albeit playing straight). With a host of goodies on this collectable release including 4 documentaries, trailers, music and the newly renovated extended version in anamorphic widescreen, this is certainly worth owning. The transfer isn't bad, but please remember these movies were made nearly 30 years ago, and then on something of a budget. Often filmed in Europe, and South America, and sometimes dubbed over with local foreign extra's they have stood the test of time well, and look pretty fine on DVD - but there not perfect by a long way, Most will probably be forgiving however on content alone. 4 stars, but not quite 5 - Enjoy

The cynic in me is beginning to wonder if there is a shortage of filmworthy material out there, as again another borrowed medium makes its transition to the screen. Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very "special interest". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation. Wait for the DVD!

30 years old and still funny, that's an achievement in itself, but perhaps like others I have to agree with the fact that this movie would never have been made today, without a slew of law suits from just about everyone.A wonderful satire on the western genre with Cleavon Little, and Gene Wilder in the main roles, obviously enjoying the material and farce of it all, in one of Mel Brook's best offerings. Fans will see most of the familiar Brooks crew (including himself) in either supporting or cameo roles throughout the picture, and although I loved this picture, it will not be to everyone's taste. There is an almost adolescent quality to the vulgarity of the movie that (without wishing to generalize) will surely be as appealing to the 18-25 demographic today, as it was in 1974. That said, you will probably want to put the kids to bed before watching this, as a young audience today, may find the messages a little mixed. There are some very good moments of biting satire, as well as over the top obvious sight and line gags, but this is still a good funny movie. Enjoy.

Another tried and tested formula with a "now grown up" group revisiting their past at a reunion, but this is much better (and funnier) than "Old School" or other recent offerings.A great soundtrack of 80's classics is also well placed throughout the movie, but it's the characters, acting and emotion that really brings the movie to life.The ensemble cast may not be considered current box office stars, but there are a lot of familiar faces in this picture, not least Eric Stolz, and former child star David Herman who are hilarious, and steal each scene respectively. It's a funny picture, but it's underpinned with a message of missed opportunity, youth, revisiting old times, and even pathos at times, as each character attempts to untie the knots in there respective life paths since last they met. Old relationships are revisited, old flames fanned, and many skeletons get an airing from the closet. I felt that it was all handled with a light touch by director Sarah Kelly who manages to keep the picture moving and injects levity strategically throughout.I suspect that the people who will get the most from this movie are those that can remember the 80's and be of the same age as the characters. Some of the humor and situations may be lost on a younger viewers, and it isn't raucous or full of innuendo and cheap titillation, which in turn will probably mean it will not command a wide audience.4 stars overall. Great Movie

I purchased this bubble jet as a second family printer mainly for documents, and letters and have been extremely impressed.It's fairly compact, very easy to install and use and has already more than paid for itself.The average cost of a replacement black cartridge is around $3 online for multi packs of 5 and I have purchased multi packs of color cartridges also online at under $5 each including shipping! Compared with many other top brands that cost up to $35 per cartridge - that's a big big saving. As I said this is a "no frills" printer, but actually has very clear reproduction onto photo paper in high color using the idiot proof "Easy Photo" software provided. The Maintenance window allows you to do many functions including resetting the cartridges for low ink warning after installing new ones, a quiet mode for night printing, and many other functions. Another gem is the "Easy-Web" print feature that allows you to capture web pages for printing on standard paper without losing information on the edges, as you would using the regular print function from Windows. The only minor complaint I have is that being a bubble jet, high quality print in both BW and color can take a little while to dry, but other than this - it's a wonderful budget package, with a well known and respected name. If you're into CAD or high quality photo reproduction, imaging and such like then this is not for you - but if you print a lot of draft quality documents, and have a family especially who churn out pages of printed matter per day, this will serve you well, and save you a LOT of money. I've had mine for over 6 months and it is in daily use with NO problems to date. Highly recommended.

Another great Clint Eastwood movie gets the DVD release treatment, and finds Clint playing the title role in this &quot;rural cop in the big city&quot; action drama. This movie paved the way for the long running and succesful (though much more benign) TV series &quot;McCloud&quot; starring Dennis Weaver, and deals with the cultural clash between a Sheriff from Arizona, and NYPD's finest. This is a fairly straightforward story, but handled very well by the Don Siegel in the directors chair, who went on to make other Eastwood gems such as Dirty Harry a couple of years later. Fighting off the constant stereotyping by his New York brother officers, Lt Coogan (Eastwood) is a laconic fish out of water, and has to track down and return to Arizona with escaped killer Ringerman, played by Don Stroud. Red tape, and more than a little obstruction by the locals, mainly in the form of Lee J Cobb as his opposite number add to his woes, along with being caught up in the 60's drug and crime scene. The story suffers a little from this point of view, as the hippie psychedelic portrayal looks a bit dated, but the action more than makes for this minor complaint. Plenty of pace makes the 95 minute running time zoom by, and even though the ending is more than a little familiar, it's still a very enjoyable movie. Good solid early Eastwood action with a few great moments of comedy thrown in, and a particularly clever choreograghed bar room brawl, complete with pool sticks and balls is worth seeing also, and durability on the rewatching scale makes this a solid buy for fans and newcomers alike. Enjoy

I have just written a review of the DVD version of this show, and the first disc is pretty much a mirror of that performance, if not mostly exact in places.There is a label on my copy of the double CD which states &quot;NO performances from this CD appear on &quot;Live on Braodway&quot; DVD or VHS, which is very misleading. Perhaps they were not recorded at exactly the same locations, but they are almost word for word the same as the DVD performance, so please be warned.The second disc however, is all different, and relates (by track) to different locations on the tour, where Mr Williams has tailored 3-6 minutes of material per location, to be locally topical. Even though I have not toured the USA a great deal, I found this CD to be very funny indeed, and it did make up for having felt cheated about the material on Disc 1. This having been said, my review of ALL the material remains the same. Great fun, but not for kids, some of the visual gags are obviously lost on the sound only version, but otherwise extremely funny. Too many expletives, but not offensive. A Comic genius at work.

Ok this is worse than average - what's going on?? - Sean Connery, Karl Malden, Natalie Wood, Brian Keith, Henry Fonda..........and the list goes on. Even Ronald Neame in the directors chair can't sum up the pedigree of his previous two movies (Poseidon Adventure, Odessa File) with this A list of stars, or the giants of MGM at the helm. It's 1979 - so let's get in some social comment, Sean Connery is an astro physicist who teaches at M.I.T and has a real distaste for the military (his former employers) for whom he designed a Space Missile Platform to avert astral disasters. They swiftly procured it and pointed it at the pesky Russians naturally (this was the height of the cold war remember)and Martin Landau is unintentionally amusing as the "don't trust the Russians" maniacal General usurped by Connery's team. Trouble is, there's now a giant Raisin on a collision course with Earth - (I say that, because that's what the special effects make it look like every time you see it swirling toward us), and there aren't enough missiles to stop it. Further more the missiles are pointing the wrong way, and we'll have to ask the Russians to help (heaven forbid). They of course deny that they have a similar platform, and we must overcome the political tug of war games first, this is to run down the survival clock, and add to the tension, I assume!! This was way before Armageddon, and Deep Impact - and was actually a fresh idea, then for the popular disaster flicks of the time. The problem is that most of the picture centers on this East/West Collaboration, and the nail biting of whether we'll get the missiles pointing the right way in time, or whether Connery & Ms Wood will get it together. There is also the worry of some astral chaff ahead of the Raisin that causes a few explosions, and flattens a Swiss Ski resort, but nothing brings any real tension for the viewer. The script is dire, and Brian Keith playing Connery's Russian opposite is completely wasted - doing about as much for the Russian accent, as Dick Van Dyke did for the Cockney accent in Mary Poppins. I saw this on it's release in a huge Cinemascope theatre, and was mildly impressed (I was younger then!), but the sad fact is that the Sfx just weren't up to the job then, and look laughable now. This movie is proof that a good list of actors can get almost anything off the cutting room floor - which was probably where this should have stayed. Even nostalgia buffs will want to avoid this one.

It's always difficult to hold a readers attention with a story that has a foregone conclusion, but Steven Pressfield has done a superb job. This is the story of the ill fated battle at Thermopylae, but unlike some accounts of &quot;The 300 Spartans&quot; gives an insightful, and inventive view. The author has obviously poured over research on this subject, and was in fact just granted an honorary citizenship in the modern region of Greece, that was once known as Sparta, such is the authenticity of the narrative. Be prepared for a good read however, this is a very descriptive, and word heavy text, which although some may find hard work, I found to be essential to it's aim. The poetic and at times almost ancient translatory style of writing brings the story to life in a tangible way, which makes you feel like you can almost smell the sweat and toil during the battle scenes. Factually based fiction, can also sometime fall flat of a lack of creative licence, but again Mr Pressfield delivers wonderfully well. I won't give the story away, but the premise is the retelling of the battle from the eyes of an injured squire and lone survivor, along with his own intertwined and dramatic life march, then relayed to King Xerxes after the battle has concluded. I am new to Pressfield, but I am already a fan, and will be seeking out his other works. Highly recommended !

This toy is designed for the 18 month upward bracket, and although our 16 month old is tall, and loves it - I feel it will suit older children better. Not too much in the way of educational value, apart from loading and unloading, and steering, but seems very well contructed overall. A minor spill involved one of the outer wheel covers coming off, but it was quickly and easily replaced, and has remained intact ever since. The basket WILL tip forward if too heavy an item is placed in it (your child for example) so caution please. Other than these couple of points it's good fun (even at her age) and she enjoys carrying around her favorite soft toys in it daily. I think she will continue to get more from it the older she gets, and durability wise it's better than a lot of other mobile items. Have fun, but keep an eye open!

Yet another comic strip makes the transition to the big screen, and actually does a pretty good job here, as we see a bunch a not exactly big name actors take on the roles of the quartet of superheroes.The pace of the movie is good, with a lot of back story, in fact if I had to complain it would be too much back story actually.Ioan Gruffudd (yes, it's a funny name) plays Reed Richards, the erstwhile partner and co-brain box of Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of TV's Nip/Tuck fame). Richards is on the brink of bankruptcy, and has to return on bended knee and ask the now billionaire Doom for funding for a new space project, who gladly obliges for a more than healthy cut of any future profits.Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (aka Human Torch) and the very sexy Jessica Alba as Susan Storm go along for the ride, with anchor man Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm in tow. If you know the story (which this is fairly faithful too), the team all get exposed to a funky solar storm in space, and return to Earth unharmed, except that they all, in turn begin to develop side effects to the space debacle, in the form of weird and amazing powers. Richards, leads his team of four, and decides to utilize their new skills for the good of all mankind, whilst Von Doom sees the opportunity to run amok with World domination on his mind. So the story is set up, and all this said would be great, if you now didn't have about only 15 minutes of the picture left. All the characters are played well, Evans has some great injections of humor, and Chiklis does his best to battle with a fairly lame sideline story about the cost of his new powers, on his former life. There is good screen sizzle between Richards, and Susan but all in all the picture leaves too much wanting.As soon as the end credits rolled, I was ready for the sequel, having just felt like I'd been teased with a great story half done. This is a good movie, and the only real complaints would be those already mentioned, and McMahon not having enough villainous charm to truly carry off the Von Doom character, although he does try hard. I hope that the next installment will be along quick enough to keep the movie fresh, but 2-3 years wait may be a death sentence. Enjoy!

Although I have previously only reviewed ROTK, having chosen to not be just another flag waving reviewer on the previous movies, I have to make comment on this extended DVD set.I'm not going to dwell too much on the actual movies, as they speak for themselves for the most part, with the exception herein of a more complete story, albeit very very long. Puritans may scoff at the deviations from Tolkeins original work, but few can surely argue at the vast spectacle of it all, and amazing achievement to bring such a complex story to life on screen. The 40-50 minutes extra footage per movie is well worth the wait, and will fill in many blanks, even if you have already seen the movie theater or previous release versions. This is mostly true in the last movie, Return of the King, which seems so different from the screen release, it almost makes you feel it was edited too harshly.For me however, the prize here is the extensive collection of special features - each film has an extra two discs, with a complete chronological series of featurettes entitled "From Page to Screen" which are fascinating to say the least. The extras are easy viewing, and give even fans an insight into the life of Tolkein, and the scale of the work that is the Lord of the Rings. It's very easy to hear that a movie costs millions to produce, but when you watch the enormous amount of detail, work, manpower, and every other facet of the production of these films over a 7 year period, you actually come away almost awe struck.A beautiful, and timeless tale that will never go out of style, and a worthy addition to any collection for many years to come. Peter Jackson, et al more than deserve every accolade and superlative that has been bestowed on the Trilogy in my opinion, and it will be interesting to see his next movie King Kong, to see whether he will be able to live up to viewers expectations. Either way, this will long be regarded among the greatest movies ever made. Superb!

I have to admit to expecting something of the calibre of an "American Pie" style lewd comedy aimed squarely at the 16 - 24 demographic, but was more than pleasantly surprised to find otherwise. Whereas this movie does have definite parallels to "Risky Business" the former teen cult classic, it's actually a very well paced, acted and script built gentle comedy, that can and does stand on its own feet. Emile Hirsch plays the shy academic desperately seeking love or sex preferably at the end of his graduating year, and hangs around with two unintentionally comic, and likeminded "nerd" friends. Enter Elisha Cuthbert as the new next door neighbor, immediately making Hirsch smitten beyond thoughts of graduation, and his impending attempts to win a scholarship to an Ivy League College. This premise alone has potential but when you add that she is a former porn star trying to escape her past, and has a seductively villianous former Producer hanging around (played brilliantly by Tim Olyphant), the standard teen love tug formula gets a much needed makeover. There are plenty of laughs and original moments as the script twists and turns, and overall the effect is a "feelgood" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't revert to formula nonsense either. Those expecting titillation may wish to check out the unrated version I suspect (not having seen it) as the bulk of the "sex" in this comedy is tastefully handled. It's refreshing to find a teen style comedy that although it might not dazzle the intellect, has a good solid story, and doesn't rely on sight gags, or cheap vulgarity. 4 stars is a little high, but this was mainly for Olyphants performance (who I last saw in Deadwood), who has a sinful panache that carries the bulk of the story (for me at least). Surprise ending may preclude repeat viewings for many, and DVD extra's are a little thin, otherwise very entertaining. Enjoy!

Hot on the heels of "On Dangerous Lard", and "Hard to Floss", the secret agents man's man is back to thwart evil doers, beat up nefarious villians and stop on the way to do some eco preaching. Billy Ray Lancing is a former covert agent (I was so surprised to find that out!) turned "Survivalist" who spends his time rescuing animals and getting in touch with nature. He is called to action however, when he suddenly discovers that the foster agency he is using to help a young girl is actually a front for a human trafficking industry. In time honored fashion the girl disappears, and Steven must put down his pruning shears and hemp weed knitting and rescue her. Plenty of rough & tumble, hard stares and stern "If you harm her I'll......." warnings follow as he cuts a swathe through the immoral band of naughty men, and the movie follows the standard formula. Our hero can of course make a high powered weapon from a stick of gum, and an empty beer can, and you immediately know that the army he is fighting have no chance. I know I am quite damning about these recent Seagal straight to video productions, which might make you ask why I keep watching them? Well, to be honest I've always been a fan of the aimless action flick, and Seagal has done some really fine work. Sadly as I hold my breath and wait for a return to movies of the Under Siege calibre, I find myself turning blue watching stuff like this instead. This is probably not as bad as the previous two offerings he has made, and credit to him for still managing to churn this stuff out, (he's hardly a young man anymore), but it is still pretty bad. Another complaint is the eco stuff - I have no problem with his obvious desire to make people more ecologically aware and responsible, but there is a platform to do it on properly, and this isn't it. Like Dangerous Ground, Fire Down Below, and The Patriot before this, the moralising wears a bit thin, and makes you ask him to jump one way or another. Either make a gratuitously violent action flick, OR a Greenpeace documentary, but STOP putting the two together please. All that said, put your brain in neutral, grab the popcorn, and enjoy the fight scenes.

This has to be one of John Woo's poorest offerings to date, and his trademark scenes are becoming ever more repetetive in successive films. Perhaps the abundance of hype surrounding the cinematic release of this movie, really didn't do it any favours, as it never lived up to expectations. The sad fact is that a talented ensemble cast and great SFX, have been nullified by a storyline that could have been written on the back of a stamp. Even the super quality of DVD, the sexy Nyah, torrid chase and action scenes can't save this movie from a lame script. Not half as good as the first movie, which in itself was something of a disappointment.

Although not as widely available here in the US as Europe, I was very pleased to get hold of this soundtrack after seeing the movie. Having seen (and reviewed) the movie adds an extra enjoyment to the CD, but it is actually a pretty good stand alone album otherwise. If you don't know the movie - Strange Fruit are an allegorical world famous band from the 70's era, and as difficult as it is to recreate that kind of sound, the producers here are to be congratulated. You will listen and come away thinking these guys were real, and were previously huge, and that's an achievement when you consider that it is the cast of ACTORS in the movie actually singing on the soundtrack - NOT stand ins. Jimmy Nail revisits his dulcet tones, which brought him moderate success as a solo artist back in the late 80's / early 90's and there are a couple of tracks from other artists. Otherwise it's Bill Nighy and the cast belting out the tunes to great effect. An umistakable 70's panache underpins the all original score, with long instrumental bridge work breaking up lyrics, and some thrash guitars, and even "Glam" rock effects for good measure. This is a very good album for a lot of reasons, and will make you want to see the movie if you haven't, and underline it sweetly if you have. I challenge you not to be moved by the haunting lyrics of the first (and movie signature) track "The Flame Still Burns". Quite expensive here in the USA, so if you know anyone in Eurpoe, get them to send it to you! Enjoy

I was interested to read the national reviews on this movie quoting Errol Flynn & Douglas Fairbanks swaggering action, wholesome values, and good old fashioned story telling, and have to agree with them for the most part. However, a homage to them this was not supposed to be, and we find yet another movie not living up to it's own press. Mortensen plays a halfbreed Indian scout working for the US cavalry who witnesses a masacre of his pseudo kinsmen, goes to work for Bill Hickok as a famous horseman and cowboy, and succumbs to his own demons, alcohol, and unrewarding lifestyle. If this sounds familiar you won't be suprised at comparisons with Dances with Wolves, and the more recent Last Samurai movies. Amidst this downward spiral he finds hope in an offer to compete in the greatest horse race in the world, the purse for which is being provided by a Sheik (wonderfully portrayed by Omar Shariff) across the Arabian deserts for 3000 miles. Having acquired a name for himself (as we have learned) for being a great distance horse racer, Mortensen, and his trusty steed - Hidalgo (also of mixed breeding) head off across the world to find, fame, fortune, and perhaps the meaning of life on the way. It's at this point that the Disney injection goes into overdrive and we're suddenly immersed into a Black Stallion meets The Mummy Returns romantic action adventure. This just doesn't tie up with the opening sobriety, or the serious messages trying to be conveyed in the first part of the movie, and artistic creativity aside, becomes more than a little contrived. I won't spoil the movie, but don't be disappointed if you have seen just about all the action scenes (and very few there are) in the trailers, and then find it's all over rather quickly, and predictably. Also don't feel bad about the "based on a true story" aspect of the film either, as any modicom of research will show only the most tenuous of links to the story on which the movie is based. This is NOT a bad movie by any means, the performances are great allround, the stunts and SfX are up to the task, and the film bobs along at a reasonable pace. That said, the long build up to the race and then subsequent "It's all over and the winner is" is disjointed and more than a let down. This will appeal to family audiences I feel, and children probably more than adults, who will doubtless be more in awe of the spectacle of it all than anyone over age 13. Good for a Saturday Morning matinee, but that's about it I'm afraid.

I have been a fan of Wes Bentley since I saw him in the latest remake of "The Four Feathers" alongside Heath Ledger (tragically no longer with us). Since then his roles have been unremarkable, and here playing a demented night watchman turned stalker you have to wonder about his material choices. Having been mostly forgettable in Ghost Rider as Black Heart and the less said about The Ungodly (aka The Perfect Witness) last year, he seems determined to appear in movies many levels beneath his talents.All that said, P2 is a routine thriller with a few twists and scary "jump" moments along the way but no real tension.An office girl (Rachel Nichols) working late gets stuck in an underground parking garage and is pursued by Bentley who one assumes does not have inviting her for coffee on his mind.Although it's somewhat formulaic, there are some surprises that lift this out of mediocrity though. Nichols is not the standard dumb bimbo, and despite her situation makes some smart moves, and definitely gets the audience behind her. Bentley is convincing as the dissassociative psycho but unfortunately there are more than the usual number of highly questionable situations and happenings that stretch credibility and reduce the tension. The setting itself is cold, dark and concrete and makes for a chilling backdrop, the camera work for the most part is tight and despite the odd very dark scene or two, keeps your attention.Overall not a bad thriller, I just kept thinking "yeah right" too many times for it to be really gripping (or believable at all in places) and that spoiled it for me over all. Definitely worth a look, but probably to rent, not buy.

The first Final Destination movie was something of a low budget success story, with a host of mostly unknown actors, and contained some interesting and thrilling elements. This sequel however just reworks old ground, and the lack of surprises make it rather ordinary viewing. The premise for both movies is the same in that when it's your time to die, if you somehow "cheat" death, it stalks you in an unseen malevolent form until your number is up. The first 15 minutes of this picture portrays a horrific multiple car accident on the freeway in very graphic and gripping fashion, and promises much in the way of tension and intrigue, as our young heroin Kimberly (played by A J Cook)witnesses the events in a premonition, and prevents a handful of characters from a scheduled date with the Grim Reaper. Too many references to the previous film ensue, and the sole survivor we are told from the last story appears briefly in cameo, to help our troubled band in their quest for survival. After the opening eye candy the movie rapidly spirals into a formula driven sequence of mini subplots concerning each character, but doesn't hold the viewer enough to make you really care about what's going on. Doing a sequel is always difficult, but when one thinks about those that are succesful, they usually have a storyline independent to their predessessor, whereas this is virtually a carbon copy with just the names and locations changed. This is an OK flick, but not much more - there are a few scary moments, and the picture will probably appeal to the 18-25 demographic, who are represented in character throughout the movie. Not bad, but not as good as the first, and too few surprises to really make it work well.

I had the privilage of seeing Phil perform live recently (in support of Kenny Chesney) and can only marvel at his talents. As well as being an accomplished pianist, his vocal talents are truly awesome. Like many I was suprised to learn that I was familiar with many of his songs, owing to him having written extensivley for other artists, from Tim McGraws latest &quot;Next 30 Years&quot; to Joe Dee Messina, and Alan Jackson - you will have heard much from this guy without ever knowing it. That however doesn't detract from his own performances and this album contains some rich lyrical hits, marking him to be a future huge star. More along the country blues style, his vocal power is stamped over all the tracks on this album, and if this is any indication of what is to come, I for one will be watching with interest. I doubt anyone will be disappointed with having this album in their collection. A Must Have !

The trailer, cover, and sleeve all hint unashamedly at an adult theme - sexually charged, and almost bordering on fetishism. What we actually have is a tardy allegory of the proclivities of two individuals who get thrown together in very unlikely fashion. The opening five minutes pulls you in and then annoyingly proceeds (like so many movies today) in retrospective fashion, outlining it's tale. A damaged, disturbed young woman finds solace in the employ of a compulsive and manipulative (if reluctant) lawyer and embarks on a series of ever more daring, and often bizarre role playing encounters. I would love to give more praise for actually outstanding performances, but the script is weak, and does not explore fully enough the story behind the story. A very good idea, handled very badly. Give it a miss.

Firstly, Christian Slater here IS excellent, no doubt.Unfortunately he is like an amazing wine with a terrible meal, you won't remember how good the wine was, just how bad everything was overall. William H Macy appears almost superfluous and seems to just be reading lines with little or no interest. A supporting cast tries hard, but just can't lift this out of the doldrums.There is real drama, and a depressing edge to the reality of boredom, inadequacy and low self esteem portrayed (I have to say bitingly believably by Slater) as you watch.The movie grabs your attention a little, and although not absorbing, it does make you want to follow the roller coaster he unwittingly steps on.But that about sums it up, you watch, and watch, and ask yourself (well at least I did) what? - The idea of someone so bored and disillusioned with life that they want to go on a killing spree isn't funny (so why the comedic references?). The taught drama this could have been never gets played out to its full potential, and the picture falls into the middle ground of not really knowing what it is trying to be. Sadly, as good as Slater is in the movie, it falls a long way short I what I expected.2 stars for Slater's 5 star performance, 0 stars for the rest of the movie.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie after the hype, and found Cruise and Foxx to be both believable and talented in their respective roles. A brief synopsis finds hard working and "nice" cab driver Max (Foxx) being unwittingly hired for the evening by ice cold mystery man Vincent (Cruise), and then dropped knee deep into an assassination spree, from which he is inextricably trapped. After a moderately slow start, the story builds nicely, with some intelligent plot work, good action sequences, and promises much in suspense, action, and the ability to hold your attention. Somewhere in the middle of the movie this gets lost, and even the most innatentive of viewers will see what's coming next from a mile away, and that's a real shame. Cruise and Foxx play off each other nicely, and there's a strange attraction to Cruises meticulous character, despite his sociopathic tendencies, and ice cold indifference to his victims. This is not a bad movie, but let's itself down with some avoidable mistakes, the main one being to revert to unlikely and implausible outcomes, just to reach the desired ending it self telegraphed earlier. Questions you may find yourself asking are: (DANGER SPOILER AHEAD)1. The US Attorney general building is guarded by one solitary guard, and otherwise uninhabited?2. Despite numerous security features in the building, Max is able to gain entry by simply walking through a side door?3. Max can run, jump and arrive to save the day from half a mile away on a parking lot roof, before Vincent can go from the 14th to the 16th floor in the same building?4. Three armed FBI units, a night club security team, LAPD, and a South American Druglords hit squad ALL in the same building with weapons drawn, ALL miss the target?These are just a few discrepancies, in an otherwise tight and pacy thriller, but given that a multitude of better directions with the story could have been taken, the one chosen is a disappointment. Good movie, but NOT great. Enjoy

At home workout DVD's and home workout equipment or regimes of any kind are hard to follow. If you already have a moderate or regular workout plan in action you will enjoy this DVD. It's balanced for cardio and flexibility, and includes two workouts, one for upper, one for lower body. I'm a fan of working the total body so this wasn't really for me, and I also think it is tailored more for women in general. It IS a good workout though, you will sweat and be blowing hard by the end of it, so if you are an average couch potato looking for a quick fix, this will probably be too much, too soon.The cover pictures and claims on these discs always make me smile, and are pretty shameless with a bikini clad beauty, and the promise to lose 8 ponds in bold print. Results are possible, but please, be a little more subtle. 4 stars overall

Oh how we love to cry "not as good as the first movie", but in truth very few movie sequels capture the freshness, or spirit of an often inventive and new idea like an original. Sadly, that is also the case here when comparing the first and infinitely better Bridget Jones Diary, but there are a few saving graces to make this at least mildy entertaining. The story picks up 4 weeks after the end of the first movie (although 3 years have elapsed in real time) and we find ALL the main characters reprising their roles. Bridget is still oozing the giddy romance and, likeably bumbling naivety of a 30 something schoolgirl, alongside Colin Firth's stoic, but gentlemanly romantic lawyer Darcy, and all seems well despite some nagging incompatibility issues between the two. The clash of class cultures between them continues (albeit in some very contrived scenarios) until doubt, envy and the adjustment of two single lifers suddenly sharing, looks set to send things off the rails. Enter at this point dashing bad boy Hugh Grant as Daniel, stirring up old memories, and mixed emotions, and conveniently now working for the same TV company as Bridget and we are set hopefully for some light entertainment. Problem however, is that none of the engaging aspects of Bridgets character from the first movie, or the concern or sympathy that were previously generated is here, and most of the original cast (nice to see as they are) are just minimally sprinkled in the plot for the purpose of continuity without any real inclusion. I kept asking myself why a sequel was necessary (as I often do, despite the obvious money spinning aspect) when the first picture was so complete, making this a reheating of old material to a large extent. There is enough charm to keep the picture moving, and the characters are all played excellently, but the script is limp overall, some parts being often less than funny completely (especially the Thai prison scenes). The occasional nice dialogue and one-liners try but fail to lift this picture out of the doldrums, and the cringe aspect of most of the embarassing situations Bridget falls into is painful at times. If you liked the first movie, chances are this will amuse you, but it's not in the same league unfortunately. There are some nice extras on the DVD including some funny interviews with the leading characters, deleted scenes, and the usual director comments etc. My best advice? rent before you buy. Enjoy!

Having two teenage daughters has increased my exposure to these modern spoof comedys that are often based on cheap laughs and vulgarity, aimed squarely at the 14-19 demographic. This third installment however is pretty bad, and actually not very funny. I'm all for a few laughs and poking fun at the horror movie genre, but since when were 8 Mile and the Matrix Trilogy horror movies??? A good cast cannot unfortunately save a lame script, and suprisingly bad direction from Mr Zucker et al, whose other films in the past have been much funnier, and much more watchable. Leslie Nielsen has a cameo as the President and Charlie Sheen plays Mel Gibson's character from the "Signs" movie, but even their comic pedigree are wasted, which is a shame. Old ideas and jokes are run through the mill to try and get some cheap laughs, and I get the feeling that even the younger generation are getting tired of sexual innuendo, and corny sight gags when they aren't supported by a reasonable story as is the case here. The DVD "extra's" are actually worth watching however from the point of view of the deleted scenes and alternate ending, which accurately show that this movie could have been EVEN worse (as unlikely as that is). One can only hope that this will be the last installment in the series. Avoid!

I first saw this movie on TV as a youngster, and remember having nightmares, and watching it again recently made me realize it's still a great movie. I will say at this point that there's more than a bit of shameless repacking going on here though:The DVD boasts 2 Movies !!Night of the Demon - UK release 95 MinsCurse of the Demon - US release 83 MinsSame movie??? why would anyone want to watch the shorter theatrical truncated version???Anyway - Dana Andrews plays a very rational psychologist who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, hints of witchcraft, ancient runes and so on. Of course, out hero is much to sensible to subscribe to this nonsensical mumbo jumbo, but as he becomes more involved, he begins to realize he may have been mistaken. The genuine angst, and fear of the characters is almost tangible in places, and a tight script, more than ably directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, I walked with a Zombie etc) keeps you glued. Ok, the demon looks a little silly, but this WAS 1957 folks, give them a break! The main point is that there is a good story, that still gives you some chills. The ever present human fear of, "it couldn't be? .......could it?" that had audiences squirming in their seats back in 1957, is what makes the movie work. If you haven't seen this, treat yourself, just don't believe you're getting 2 movies for the price of one!!! - Enjoy

This is Robin Williams at his manic best:- raw, inventive and very very close to the mark, if not over it, in this riotious stand up performance of recent material. Once I had overcome his constant breaks to drink water during the performance, I found myself watching it over and over, and gaining more with each screening. Be warned though - this is definitely for adults only, and I didn't given the movie 5 stars for one simple reason. Williams seems to have a constant need for expletives thoughout the show, to the point of over saturation I felt, and whereas I never felt offended by it, it did begin to grate by the end. A lot of the material is also very adult orientated, and one wonders a little if the R rating should have been replaced by MA. These minor grumbles aside, I can honestly say I hurt from laughing by the time it was over. Mr Williams who hardly (it seems) draws breath between, observations, gags, inuendo, and dragging just about every race, religion, and ethnic group through the mud, has humor, biting satire, and a consumate comic prescence. Enjoy, but put the kids to bed first!

This modern animated retelling of the classic "David & Goliath" story is a delight for adults and children, although I suspect it is more suitable for younger children than teens.The religious message in the story is nicely interwoven without being overt and I'm sure is handled in such a way to appeal to people of any Christian faith.Davie (a young farmer who dreams of being a hero) is summoned to represent the Zites after he "volunteers" when no one else will come forward to challenge the marauding Golimyr whose aim is to distinguish their faith, along with any challenger.The basic story from here stays quite true to the biblical story upon which it is based, but is exciting and extremely engaging, especially to younger minds.Not a real complaint, but I wish the movie had been longer than the 45 minute run time, although it is great for repeat viewings.Another reviewer has gone into detail about the excellent animation, so I won't here. The voice acting and characters are great also, and I thoroughly recommend this movie to people with younger children.

This remake of the 1970 movie of the same name starring Tom Selleck is not immediately what you are likely to expect, after about 15 mins into the picture. Set at the turn of the 19th century, Selleck plays the title role as a true cowboy, slowly realising that he is rapidly becoming an anachronism, to the ever evolving world around him. Unhappy with what he sees more and more, he comes to take a stand against the faceless Eastern companies threatening the very fabric of his World, in heroic, but not typical fashion, and this essentially sets up our story. Hardly action packed, and more than a few dry screen moments mean however, that Selleck really has to work hard to maintain the flow of the story, but he does so with a depth of character and credibility that is accomplished to say the least. This is probably not a movie you will sit around and talk about for hours, and will ceratinly be more popular with dedictaed fans of the genre, rather than a more mainstream audience. All that aside, this is a good movie, with some great acting. that unfortunately that just misses the mark.

Steven Spielberg is no stranger to delicate political topics, and herein makes no exception with a fairly graphic, factually based chronology of the Black September aftermath at the 1972 Munich Olympics of the title, the five men chosen to eliminate the ones responsible, and the fallout and retribution on both sides, engendered thereafter.Eric Bana plays Avner, an expectant father and low key Mossad enlisted soldier, but son of a hero, who is as horrified and outraged at the events of Munich as the rest of his family and countrymen. He is called to undertake a special "task" outlined by prime minister Golda Meir and her cabinet, in the wake of the killings to "let the World know" the consequence of the Palestinians actions, by setting off to Europe with a list of assassination targets. I won't go into too much further detail, as I don't wish to spoil the movie. I actually have vague memories of the Israeli Hostage debacle at Munich myself, and went on to study the (then termed) Arab/Israeli Conflict in more detail several years later. As an impartial, it is perhaps easier to see through the passionate elements of the story, and draw conclusions on a wider, human level, and it is here that the power of the story lies. Regardless of your political, or religious affiliations, the story is much deeper than the apparent two sides on display, and yet becomes paradoxically more basic in its message (at least in my humble opinion as to the message Spielberg seems to be trying to get across). This is not about "highly trained" assassins paying dues, but rather, well intended, deeply motivated and passionate men following orders for what they think is right, and juggling with their own morality later. The question it seems is an age old one, "does the end justifying the means" and as the story deepens and unfolds, the main characters all begin to battle with moral demons, and paranoid soul searching. There is a wealth of talent on display here, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds (HBO Rome's Caesar), Daniel Craig (the new 007 by the way) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Jakob the Liar) and several others, who glean the benefits of a tight script and masterful direction by Spielberg throughout. There are some terrific moments of high tension, some very graphic violence, and also unfortunately, some stale plodding periods along the way. I marveled at the attention to detail in re creating 1973, from the models of European cars, and clothing, to even correct movie posters outside theatres, appearing in no more than a walk across scene. On the down side, this movie is a tad on the long side at 2hrs and 44 mins, and could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes. Others have suggested that more could have been done with the material, although I thought it was well handled (with the exception of juxtaposing a sex scene with hostage murders). It is certainly well deserving of the `R' rating, and doesn't (in the usual Spielberg fashion) shy away from the grittiest of details, especially in the bombing and murder scenes. On the whole I rated it 4 Stars, which is probably a little generous, but the polished feel to the whole picture, and excellent acting all round is well worthy of merit. An Oscar contender? I doubt it, and it's hardly Stevens's best work to date, but it IS well worth seeing. Enjoy

Call me crazy, but there are a lot of similarities between this story, and the succesful Dan Brown novel, so much so that Ron Howard who is currently making THAT movie, may want to watch this for some tips. This is GREAT fun, and a good family action/adventure romp. Nicolas Cage plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, one of a long family line of treasure hunters, eschewed by his peers, and the scientific community in general, for having chased a "mythical" treasure most of his life. After finding a very big clue to his quest in the Arctic, he is double crossed by his financial partner (Sean Bean) and left in the snow while the former returns to Washington, to plan some nefarious activites. In case you haven't seen any of the trailers, the premise is that there is a hidden map on the rear of the declaration of independence which Cage must protect by stealing it himself. The implausibly young and attractive archive director Dr Chase (Diane Kruger)gets caught up in the action, as does Cages father played by Jon Voight, and his quirky computer whizz sidekick essential to attract the 14-21 demographic. The key word here is Improbable (or any other synonym you may choose) as Cage is able to decipher each more increasingly obscure and difficult clue, by simple brainstorming, and plenty of AHA! moments after pause for thought lead us on to the next level. If you can forgive this aspect of the story you will love this movie, there is a lot of action, escapes, a little romance, and Cage et al are believable for the most part. Will they find the treasure? - well you'll have to see for yourself, but if you want a family adventure sure to appeal to all ages this holiday season, this is the pick of the bunch so far. Enjoy!

When I first saw this movie on it's release I was afraid it was going to fall into the usual cliched romance genre, but was more than pleasantly suprised.It's a simple story, very well padded out, that delivers (I feel) more than it ever set out to do. John Cusack meets Kate Beckinsale briefly with more than a touch of Kismet, and as they agree to part company he writes his number on a $5 bill, and she writes hers inside a semi-notable book. The premis being that if they should somehow discover each others contact details at sometime in the future, then "fate" has stepped in and given them a clear message that they should be together. Time passes and as they each go their own way, and begin new lives with their respective partners, they still feel inexplicably drawn to keep searching for each other, on the grounds that they could "just be" soul mates. As implausible as the story seems, it unfolds very well with some very poignant moments, as well as comic (if a little unrealistic) scenes thrown in for good measure. You won't need an IQ of 145 to figure out how it's all going to end, but it gently jogs the viewer along, and never really gives up until the last. An underlying, and very well acted subplot (almost) to all of this is, that there are winners and losers - when two people are meant it seems for each other in such a way (if you believe in fate or karma, or whatever)then they are inevitably people on the other side of the fence who lose out. The movie is tempered with brevity and shows this well without ever being conceited or preachy, and the end result is a joy to watch. This is also a fairly durable movie for rewatching, and the DVD has some nice (if not remarkable) extras to add to the value. There's no real sex, violence, bad language or other and it is a nice reminder of an older style of romantic comedy, brought up to date. Good fun allround - I thoroughly recommend.

Before I get to the movie, a couple of points I think worthy of mention.First of all, if like me you are one of the people trying to embrace the new 3D wave, and have shelled out for the equipment to do so, it's a shame that you cannot buy a bare bones 3D version of the film.DVD and now Blu-Ray have always given the choice it seems of a standard 1 disc release, and then a 2 or 3 disc "special edition" with bonus features etc.While these are nice to have, it's harsh to have to shell out for the 3D release, with 4 discs, if you have no need for the other copies, perhaps this will change as 3D becomes more mainstream and affordable.Secondly, watching this movie demonstrates the huge disparity or broad width of the PG-13 rating, with the exception of a few scary images, this film has no sex, no bad language, very little to offend, and the violence is stylized and succinct. One wonders how a movie like this, which I was happy to watch with younger children (7 & 9) after seeing myself first, has the same rating as something like the Twilight franchise? Perhaps this deserved less, others more or we need a middle rating in between?Anyway, the movie itself.Both the 3D version specifically and the BD version in this set have phenomenal pictures and sound, the opening part of the movie is quite darkly lit, but that is nothing to do with the reproduction here. The 3D is also nicely done, controlled like Avatar, without the director feeling the need to throw things out of the screen all the time and say "this is 3D!" like the rather ridiculous "Drive Angry".The story is an old and has been well told in many formats over the years, young petulant and headstrong Thor get's on the wrong side of his father the King, thanks to some back stabbing connivance by younger brother Loki, and ends up on Earth, to find himself, and learn humility, sacrifice and how to be a king, not just a warrior.The action is well interspersed and the movie moves at a nice pace, plenty of eye candy, some humor, and enough references to the upcoming Avengers flick next year to keep the comic book fans happy.That said, and to reiterate the comments of others, this is a stand alone movie, whether you are familiar with the comics, Norse legends or not, and is well directed by Kenneth Branagh.Good old fashioned storytelling it is, the movie opens strong, builds well, and ends satisfyingly, with enough of a crack in the door for a sequel, or to whet your appetite for the upcoming aforementioned Avengers movie.Heroes, villains, battles, betrayal, loyalty, and action abound, even the love interest is tastefully handled and compliments the story.I for one was very impressed with relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth (I don't really count his cameo at the beginning on the Star Trek remake) and think he will definitely be one to watch.5 stars for great entertainment, relax and enjoy with the whole family, just remember some of the scary stuff will be too much for very young viewers probably.

This came in on the latter(and cheaper) end of the long line of excellent Palm products, and is a very easy to use, ergonimaclly friendly toy. Yes, I said toy because unfortunately it's just too out of date. You can now have as many features on your cellphone as this offers, and even at under $40 - buying something that has only 2MB of memory and is not upgradeable is simply a waste. No offence to Palm, I like their products, and have had several, but please wake up and smell the future! There are now a great many affordable PDA's out there that you can do so much more with, and products like this, however well made have just been left behind. For example, at still under $100 is the Hewlett Packard Jornada 525 Color Pocket PC - upgradeable and has ten times the power and functions. Save your money, and buy something more modern.

Based on the successful books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, the adventures (if that's the right word) of the likeable but quirky Alice (Alyson Stoner) make it to the big screen in this Disney channel ready adolescent comedy drama. After the death of her mother, Alice is uprooted by father Ben and moved to a new town, school, teacher's friends and all that goes with it amidst her adolescent angst and tumultuous throws of simply being a teenager.Her shyness and isolation leads her to live out her dreams in vivid fantasies that often get her into tricky (and often funny) situations.That pretty much sums up the picture; it's fairly predictable as we watch her interactions and growth but gladly without being too sickly sweet.A genial cast including the likes of Luke Perry and Penny Marshall as the (almost sinister) teacher Mrs. Plotkin, help the story along and give it a well rounded family appeal.As long as you accept the intentions of the movie to appeal almost singularly to its targeted viewers you will enjoy it, although for me there wasn't enough breadth or character embellishment to covet a wider audience.Overall 4 stars for some believable and solid acting performances from the young cast. Not my particular kind of movie, but a nice (and fairly safe) viewing time with the family.

If you're looking for a "do it all" digital camera, and you're on a budget, this is outstanding. On the other hand, if you need, or demand superb quality prints this is not for you.The package includes a still zoomable camera (up to 4 megapixel) Digital Camcorder, Voice recorder, and MP3 player, and is a nice, well made all round package. As others have said, it badly needs a flash system, to help with both the photo, and video functions, but otherwise, it's neat, and a great converation piece, Smaller than a packet of cigarettes, it's a good improvement on the 3000 model that preceded it for a couple of reasons, and worth the extra $40 or so.It has a rechargable battery, mini tripod, 32MB SD card, carry case, USB lead, S3 lead and mains adapter. I purchased a 256MB SD card for around $50 which gives about an hour of video on highest resolution, and more than enough photo's, even at the highest 4meg setting. On the down side, YOU NEED MORE LIGHT. if you're taking video or photo's indoors, the ambient light makes the resolution suffer, especially on zoom, or even different macro settings. My handy tip on playback for the video is to set your computer media player to 640x480 max resolution, or you'll see a blocky pixel finish. The MP3 repro isn't bad, and probably comparable with cheaper players, but not wonderful, and the voice recorder is more of a toy than anything else. All that said, overall, I thought it was well worth the money, and have been very happy with it, for it's portability and multi functions. Considering that most digital video cameras will cost you at least 2.5 to 5 times as much, this isn't a bad investment. I am a little worried that the integral touch pad and on/off switch may not stand up to too much abuse, but otherwise I recommend this wholeheartedly. Just remember before you buy that there is a lot of truth in the saying "you get what you pay for" so it's good, but not great.

As has probably been echoed in many other reviews, this movie was a pretty painful depiction of the real life struggle John was having with his own ill health at time of production. The storyline is somewhat simple - a dying infamous gunfighter is finally facing fear, but not at the hands of another gunman, rather at a painful and debilitating illness. James Stewart adds grace to the aging town doctor who tells Wayne &quot;I would not die a death like I described, if I were brave like you&quot;, lending to a story of one final showdown. Some interesting cameos add to the plot, and an early performance from Ron Howard as an impressionable teenager blend well. I think what sets this apart from many Wayne movies, is his versatility - often rebuked for writing his own character over other roles, here he is both believable and accomplished. Amazing as it is that he only ever won a single academy award (True Grit), he genuinely deserved one for this movie. Stirring and realistic, a very very good movie.

Love this album as much today as I did when I first heard it, only now I've come to appreciate the depth and talent of Jim Steinmans lyrics even more.As a follow up to the seminal 1977 Bat out of Hell (arguably in the top ten albums of all time), it has a broad range, heavy riffs, haunting ballads, and flat out rock n roll.I'm not going to dwell on the quality of the songs, chances are if you're reading this, or considering buying this album, you're already a fan.I do want to mention the disc itself though.There are some reviews of a poor recording out there, in fact you can buy it for about $5 less here on Amazon.This album I'm reviewing here is on the SONY album, and although it's not a full remaster like Bat out of Hell, it's great quality.The other, cheaper album is a re release on the Label: Sbme Special Mkts.Do yourself a favor, pay the extra, it's worth it5 stars

Probably one of Danny kayes best known movies, and never seems to lose it's charm. A very thin story line is beautifully padded by the multiple personalities played out in the daydreams of our erstwhile anti-hero. A wonderful cameo from Boris Karloff adds to the comic excitement of a fast paced story, and Kaye delivers brilliantly with impeccable timing during each sub plot. Almost a multiple picture in picture movie, the ending really holds no suprises, but gently jogs the viewer along, without some of the kitch so prevalent in other movies of the era. Danny Kaye really was a comic genius, and in some ways the picture reflects his own life which was widely believed to be that of a painfully shy and reserved man. A great family film, my daughters aged 12 and 14 actually stayed glued to the film throughout, proving that &quot;old fashioned&quot; homely family films can stand the test of time with contemporary audiences. A worthy addition to any collection.

I used to play this game with a pencil and paper, and it's still a great game. Kids won't realise that they're using strategy and concise logical problem solving, once they have played this a couple of times, and even for todays computer age, this is still very appealing and addictive. With it's ease of set up, and robust design, it will provide hours and hours of inexpensive fun, and every succesive generation seem to love it (I even bought one for myself). Great for younger kids too (with a little help) - and can help demonstrate many basic math puzzles, by making them fun. Oh by the way, the noises are great too !

The commercial makes it look so exciting, and kids WILL have fun with this game. However, be prepared to have an adult to supervise, the construction of the trap, and direct gameplay (which can be frustratingly long for younger children). Sadly, this game won't stand up to too much punishment, many small and often vital pieces are easily broken rendering the whole game useless. Having been around for so long it's getting pretty stale as well, and offers zip in the way of education - except taking turns, and fair play. Not for younger kids, and probably OK for the 7-10 range, but they probably want a computer ! It's probably time the makers of this game visited the year 2000

I saw this film at the cinema back in 1979, and thought it was pretty tense and scary back then.In truth, by todays standards it's quite tame as a horror film, and more of a creepy mystery.Plummer as Holmes and Mason as Watson are both excellent in their respective roles, and the movie now pushing 30+ years old still holds up well, both in story and mood, even if the backdrops and representations of Victorian London look a little cheap.Viewers who watched the Jack the Ripper story more recently with Johnny Depp in "From Hell" will recognize the upper class conspiracy aspects of the story, and that they arguably borrowed directly from this film, for their story.Holmes is requested to look into the recent "Whitechapel Murders" by a group of local blue collar workers, a fact that immediately fuels his interest, as the usual channels of police inquiry, that involve him have been conspicuous by their absence.As he delves into the case, he begins to piece together a common thread between the victims, and suspicions that point to the corridors of power, a potential Royal scandal, Freemasons, and the chief of police himself.Unlike a typical Watson, James Mason is not a blustering sidekick but rather a thinking physician, who offers insight and a lot of assistance to Holmes.He is however, entrenched in the era of the high classes being beyond reproach, and juggles his opinions accordingly, even when presented by the surmise and well founded theories of his colleague.The story moves at a good pace, and builds tension nicely throughout, as the chase begins to catch the ripper before the next potential victims are also murdered to continue a high class cover up.I like Plummer as Holmes, he brings a human and balanced compassion to the role, without ever losing the intensity of the character. I also liked the idea of how heinous crimes are being committed with the utmost impunity to cover an indiscretion, like an upper class boys club closing ranks.You will probably see the end coming a mile away (especially if you watch the trailer included in the DVD extras - please don't do this before you watch the movie!)That aside, it is worth the viewing, although the case is never completely "wrapped up" leaving you feeling a little cheated.It was a bit of a stretch to imagine Holmes in a meeting with the Prime Minister, Home Secretary, and Chief of Police, condescending and barking evidence, but one must accept that Holmes's pedigree and notoriety as a great detective, would have been enough at that time to carry it off.On a final note, Jack the Ripper was of course a REAL person who, although his identity was never revealed, killed and mutilated women in London in the 1880's and Sherlock Holmes was a fictional detective, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so don't pull it to pieces for historical accuracy, this is a movie.4 Stars.

I just purchased this set to boost my collection of Queen albums and have been a fan since they emerged in the early 70's. OK, so this is NOT a reflection of this multi talented band in entirety, and they certainly produced a lot of good albums after "The Game" (last album chronologically in this set)so a 25 year box set is missing quite a bit. That said, this set does contain some of their best work. From the deep rock seasoning of "the Prophets Song" and "Tie your Mother Down" to the choral flow of Brian May's "39", the rasping brood of Roger Taylors "In Love with my Car" and even the campy eloquence of "Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon" (plus many many more) one thing becomes quickly clear. Queen as a band never stood still, with a broadness of range and evolving style, this multi talented quartet were at the top of their game, and the forefront of Rock music for the last thirty years, and have doubtless inspired, and spawned many famous names since.This rating has to be 5 stars from a collectors point of view all the way for the following reasons:1) These are the original recordings remastered onto CD, and they sound just like the vinyl albums. Great!2) They are the original length albums, not remixed, rehashed, or added to with special "bonus" tracks and weird "mixes"3) Nice presentation velvet box, and I like the copy of the album sleeves for each CD, some bifold, some single sleeve with protective inner sleeves. Also complete lyric list booklet.4) The first (and arguably the best) of their amazing range is here, in their first eight albums.True musicians as they were, it was not until the release of "The Game" that they caved, and began to use synthesisers (each preceeding album boasts "no synths" in the album smallprint).Having said all of this about this great set, they are one or two things you should remember however.1) A lot of good stuff came after this set, so it doesn't actually represent 25 years.2) It's a collectors set, so it's overpricedI know a lot of people could care less about nice sleeves, and a fancy velvet box, and indeed most of these will end up in flip cases, or CD sun visors. Also some people may like the re releases with the bonus tracks and buying the individual albums may be cheaper. My advice - this is a MUST HAVE either way, I still used Amazon, but sorry guys I used your marketplace and saved over $65!! on retail, so shop wisely. Enjoy

4 Stars, may be generous, as this is a rather dated, studio bound version of some Holmes classic mysteries.However, if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, or more importantly in this case Peter Cushing, it's a small price to pay for a collection of made for TV episodes that shine with his talent.I have long considered Peter Cushing to be one of England's finest character actors, although his exposure here in the US may be limited to his portrayal of Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars, or in re runs of the classic Hammer Horror Films of the 60's and 70'sThere were originally 16 episodes of this BBC TV series made, of which I'm told only 5 or 6 remain (5 being included here). This was do mainly to money shortages at time or production, and film being re used or "taped over" to make new episodes.The budget constraints are also plain to see in the production. Most of the episodes are shot indoors with minimal location shots, and the set design and finished episodes can hardly be regarded as lavish. A lot of people watching this for the first time will undoubtedly be disappointed, especially when comparing it to the phenomenal portrayal of Holmes by the late Jeremy Brett many years later.This remains however classic in it's own right, chiefly as a vehicle for Cushing. As always, his acting is intensely focused, and almost meticulously driven on screen, as if he were born to play Sherlock Holmes (as he did succesfully in the full length hammer movieThe Hound of the Baskervilles)Despite the almost play like scenery you believe he is Conan Doyle's creation on screen, articulate, intelligent and focused without ever being overplayed or ham.Some of the episodes suffer from a "skipping through" feeling compared to the books, again no doubt due to filming time and budget constraints, but Peter Cushing (at least for me) remains as one of the greatest actors to play Holmes, only Basil Rathbone, and the aforementioned Jeremy Brett rate higher.It's a real shame only these few episodes remain, but it is worth seeing acting in it's fullest sense, without the need for a cast of hundreds, or masses of special effects. A True Classic British TV series. Enjoy!

As you read reviews on this production, you have to remember that most (if not all) of us writing never actually "knew" the man, but I have to begin this review by saying, that which I do know, and have learned, watched and read, tells me that this is a very unbalanced program.Having listened to their music from the very beginning, been fortunate enough to see them in concert in 1980, and as a fan seen, heard and read too many articles to list here, I think the documentary gives a very poor representation - those with little knowledge of the man, or the band may come away from this thinking he was self absorbed, spoiled, arrogant and a bit of a jerk, and that's a real shame.I also don't know how you can breeze through Queen's early library in a 5 minute montage and then spend 15 minutes talking about Freddies sexual proclivities, and the gay scenes in New York, and around the World.The program focuses, for the most part on Freddie's solo career attempts, the disastrous (in terms of sales) Bad Guy album, later The Great Pretender, and lastly his collaboration with Montserrat Caballe on the Barcelona album.I'll make a personal observation here, that way too much time is spent on the Barcelona project, as some have already said, perhaps to coincide with the re-release of the album, this documentary almost is an advert for that release.There are some great on camera interviews, a lot of previously unseen footage, a piece on Freddie performing with the Royal Ballet, and even the unreleased collaboration with Michael Jackson is discussed - imagine how much that would sell for today if it was dug up and released??What this documentary showed me was what a complex man Freddie was, almost a tortured artist, opera singer, ballet dancer, writer, poet and lover all rolled into a rock star, who at times fell victim to his own success. What it didn't show was the full picture. For me Freddie was a great showman, probably one of THE greatest frontmen, and in my mind, no band ever performed better to big stadium audiences.I personally could care less about his personal life, the hedonism of the 70's and 80's may seem shocking to people watching now in 2013, but I was always more interested in his music.Brian May said of Freddie that he was " A Lover of Life, a Singer of Songs" and these words are carved on his statue on the shore of Lake Geneva.Whatever you take away from this documentary, take it with a pinch of salt, and remember you have only seen about 20% of the full picture.

It's difficult to give longevity to any game of this type, and making it impossibly difficult is a turn off also. The balance here is pretty cool, most of the World's top fighters are here for you to use and play around with, with a mixture of fighting styles, and moves. The graphics engine is tight, and amongst the most realistic out there, even if the blood splattering on the canvas and the camera lens doesn't always tie up. The "create a fighter" is fun, and involving, and although the actual fight controls are complex, they aren't ridiculous as in some other games.On the plus side, this game has good playability and the experimentation with different set moves, clothes, styles, and a myriad of moves keep you interested. On the negative side the "easy" level is too easy, and the normal and pro levels take time and patience, thankfully there is a continue option when you get beaten. There is lots of potential for two player and multi player options, but the opening entrance sequences and pre fight garb get tedious after a few watches. Overall not the best martial arts fight game out there, but not too complex to operate, and great graphics make it a bargain title for the PS2. More die hard fans should check out the new "Rocky" for pure boxing, otherwise this is a good night in laugh. Enjoy!

Great movie about main character Bernie (Wiiliam H Macy) who plays the title role as a gambling "Jonah" employed by Alec Baldwin to circulate his casino, and snuff out any chances of his clientele getting on a winning streak. The plot here is extremely convoluted with a host of well known cameos, and the representation of the seedy Vegas casino life as the backdrop to a romantic yet tense storyline is excellently handled. Without going into too much detail, Bernie inadvertently finds mutual attraction with one of his "marks" which leads to untold complications, and the coming together of several different sub plots. The end result is eclectic, but thoroughly absorbing for the viewer, and the parallels to other great Casino movies are tactfully handled, without overtaking the script. Some strong sexual content, violence and language ensure an R rated audience, and despite the borders of credibility being stretched a little at the end, this is a very polished piece of filmmaking.

I actually had no intention of seeing this movie but have to admit to being succesfully goaded by some nifty trailer advertising. Yet another remake is put through the mill here, but somehow you just know that with Frank Oz directing, there is unlikely to be any of the dark or sinister tension of the original movie. If you don't know the story, Kidman and Broderick play not so happy couple who move to the "burbs" of Connecticut after her high powered career is pushed off the rails. Broderick enrolls in the "Mens Club" and is in awe of all of his new found friends who seem fully content, and have happy smiling wives who bend to their every whim. Stepford seems the ideal community, too ideal in fact, and Kidman and Bette Midler (playing a neurotic author)suspect foul play, and in so doing hopefully pull us (the audience) into a darkly comic mystery? Or not as the case may be as this can only be regarded as a limp comedy at best. This movie has a great cast, and the first 30 minutes or so builds nicely and promises much. Oz directing tries to bring a contemporary slant with some subtle side comment on reality shows, but the reworking of the original script gets quickly bogged down in its own incredulity. Some reviews have been a little too harsh in my opinion, probably due mostly to the inevitability of it all (even if you haven't seen the original) coupled with a completely ridiculous ending that's too silly for words. But despite this there are a few saving graces, particularly from Roger Bart as the overly camp Roger Bannister who aids Midler and Kidman. Overall though, a very disappointing outing considering the array of talent on display. Check it out for a few laughs if you must, and then compare it the original, which although outdated is far superior. 2 stars (just) mainly for cast. Enjoy?

Stepping out a little here as a dowdy English teacher in the less attractive part of Manhattan, Meg Ryan becomes a key witness in a murder hunt, for a killer who likes to hack up the bodies of his woman victims. Trying to ditch an obsessive old flame who won't take no for an answer, and helping her half sisters emotional torments, she lives in her own world of emotional starvation, poetry and erotic fantasy. Enter here detective Mark Ruffalo, who sweeps here into a series of erotic encounters, but remains dark and mysterious. There really should have been enough here for a pacy thriller, but boy of boy is this dreary. Director Jane Campion has spent so much time trying to build tension, and twisted character development, she seems to have forgotten how to hold an audiences attention. I don't want to be overly damning, but I really had hoped for more, from someone of Ryan's character, and acting ability. A few red herrings do little to hide the ending, and the movie is sadly numbing, and very unlikely at times. At just short of two hours, a story like this has to have some ups and downs to jog you along, but the whole thing just drags at a slow pace annoyingly. Not a bad script, and maybe worth a rental, but I can't praise it too much, and 2 stars is being generous. Disappointing.

I gave this book 5 stars for it's concise approach, beautiful photographs, and chronological narrative that gives even a complete Greek historical novice a valuable insight into this incredible man.I found the book very easy to read, absorbing, and never felt weighed down with pages and pages of ancient descriptive text.If you want to find out about Alexander, this book is by no means an all encompassing reference but it does give you the chief salient points, as a companion to the movie, or a documentary you may have watched, and makes for fascinating reading.As you try and imagine yourself in 340BC, just stop and think as you read, and the exploits and achievements made by Alexander and his army have probably never been equaled to this day.Another thing I love about this book, is a lot of map referencing. It's easy to wax on about Sogdia and Sewa without knowing where there are on a map today, seeing the geography of today in comparison, only widens the sense of wonder, but does help put the history in even more perspective.Highly recommended book. 5 Stars

Pierce Brosnan is the main reason for recommending this movie, (although the whole movie does have a polished feel) as a battle hardened Vulcanologist sent to investigate some unusual readings in peaceful upper Washington State. Soon after his arrival he becomes alarmed at what he discovers, and dutifully informs the authorities of impending disaster who choose (of course) to ignore him, in time honored fashion. Although you know pretty much what is going to happen thereafter, this movie is pretty gripping, and was arguably better than "Volcano" with Tommy Lee Jones, which was released around the same time. Yes, it's riddled with cliches, and has an essential mixture of characters you might find in any disaster based story, but it has a certain something that gives it a more dramatic feel. Linda Hamilton of Terminator fame is the love interest/only person sensible enough to believe Mr Brosnan, and around the mid way point the story changes (reliably almost) into an escape flick. One or two scenes of intense peril, make this unsuitable for smaller children, but otherwise it's fairly tame. Considering the year of production the special effects are pretty amazing, and the acting all round adds more than credibility to the storyline. Although others will I'm sure disagree, this is a far better picture than say, the more recent Day After Tomorrow for not relying solely on good visuals, and is testament to the fact that a good story, makes for a good movie. Worth a revisit even if you've seen it before, and a decent amount of extra's on the DVD make it worth a purchase. Enjoy.

Fans of Reba can be forgiven for finding this a little removed from her usual graceful style on first listening. The title track, which is the first on the album is very upbeat with great tempo, instrumentals and some bluesy vocals. But as the lyrics of that song denote, &quot;just keeps getting better&quot;, is the best advice for this album. Most people will immediately play the well known and recent hit tracks like &quot;I'll Be&quot; and &quot;What do you Say&quot;, and probably brush over the others herein. But here is the power of this album, after you have listened a couple of times, it grows on you very quickly, and you will find yourself humming along to many excellent new songs. Always admired for her ability to seek out accomplished lyrics, this album is no different, and if anything just demonstrates her enduring popularity and ability to adapt her music to a new generation of listeners. The the addition of the Enhanced CD features, like screensavers, weblinks, and other information - this is Reba for the new millenium. Bold, beautiful and brilliant - a great addition for any existing or new fan.

Now 5 years old, and released around the time when Earth destruction seemed to be the winning formula at the box office. This Sfx out the wazoo epic has none of the flare, drama, or intellect that other offerings had around at that time (closest comparison being Deep Impact), and my only real complaint would be, that it thinks it did.Here's the story - A huge Meteor is heading for Earth, and we're all about to die. Good news is that, after scouring the 5 Billion inhabitants on this planet, we managed to find a bunch of Oil Rig workers, who are the ONLY ones, able to save us.Bruce Willis is at his best (and worst) as Iron Jawed team leader, who must land on the meteor, dig a hole, and plant some explosives. His fellow workers (all with colorful backgrounds) will be able to go from beer drinking party animal roughnecks, to fully trained and specialised astronauts in about 6 weeks, and then try and pull off this amazing feat before we all get roasted. Sounds great, and actually it is a lot of fun - just make sure you leave the grey matter behind on this one and accept it for what it is...

An interesting movie, certainly watchable, but not one of Nicholas Cages better offerings.This movie is being compared to the Death Wish movies, owing to it's vigilante theme, and it's certainly gritty, and absorbing in places. However, it lacks any of the depth or believable qualities of the former, and stretches the suspension of disbelief, frequently.The acting is solid, not stellar, and it was interesting to see Guy Pearce in yet another quirky role.For fans of the genre, there will probably be enough to keep watching, but it plods a little for my taste, with few surprises.The ending is reasonably satisfying, and not overly moralistic, but overall I gave it three stars. Rainy day movie.

Representing over 7 years of hard work and endless road trips, this album is a voyage of delightful musical discovery. Everything is here, soft ballads, haunting melodies, up beat new country dance and the list goes on. But what seems to make it stand out is the balance of the aforementioned songs. There is simply something for everyone here, the kind of CD you can leave playing all day and never tire of. Having recently seen Kenny perform all but 3 of the tracks on this album live (during his current tour), I can honestly say it is a treat. If you don't know Kenny or his music, but like new or even classic country - this is the one of the best albums you will buy this year, and probably next.

With the drab backcloth of a war torn Denmark after the German occupation in WWII, I wasn't expecting as crisp a picture with rich colors, and generally a very nice Blu-Ray transfer. As the description states, the extra features on the disc are in PAL format, so may not be playable on some TV set ups, although the main feature is region free.The movie can be viewed in Danish, or German with English subtitles.So on to the movie.Despite growing up in Europe, and having an interest in WWII both historically, and in film, I was somewhat ashamed to admit that I knew virtually nothing about the impact of that conflict on countries like Denmark, it always seemed to be just rolled in to a more overview of the annexing of most of Europe at the time.Flame and Citron (based on true events) is a stark, but visually compelling deep, deep drama that manages to be entertaining and informative at the same time.Don't expect wall to wall action, this is more of a smoldering story that even feels like it plods in places, but the tension and drama feel real, even stifling at times.Thure Lindhardt (Many may remember him as the Swiss Guard who gets locked in the vault with Tom Hanks in Angels and Demons) is outstanding playing the 23 year old, fiery red headed Flammen (Flame). He's idealistic, energetic and driven by his love for "Mother Country" to kill the enemy at all costs, but also introspective enough to know he's living on borrowed time, and that the orders he carries out make him at times question his conscience.Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale, Clash of the Titans) plays the older Citronen (Citron) , estranged from his wife and child, and so weighed down with the weight of the German occupation, and his resistance dealings, he always seems weary, unkempt, and deeply depressed throughout the movie.Both actors (and indeed the whole cast) are excellent.At a little over 2 hours, some may find it a little to slow and long, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.Although dark in it's depiction of a struggling people under the boot of the Nazi war machine, with local people turning traitors, spies and double agents, betrayal and murder. The film has a personal feel to it. The violence is never stylized or gratuitous, and the strong human story of love and death is well depicted throughout.As a movie going people we need to get over our avoidance of foreign language films, the popular cry of "I'm not paying to READ a movie" is small minded and means that movies like this invariably go straight to DVD, or only get limited releases in theaters, and that's a shame.If you like spy thrillers, drama's or have an interest in WWII movies, this is certainly worth a look. 4 stars

Four stars may seem a little generous, but this IS an entertaining entry in the "Slasher Horror" category from Norway. Originally called Fritt Vilt from 2006, it had enough success (mainly in Europe) to bankroll a sequel, aptly named Fritt Vilt II in 2008, which I have not seen, but hear is even better.There has been a mild resurgence in the slasher genre made so popular in the 80's over the last couple of years (Hatchet, immediately springs to mind as one viewers in the US would remember recently). But watching several from around the World, few bring anything new to the table, and even though Cold Prey falls into that group, it seems more watchable. Five good looking young friends go skiing, but the regular slopes are too crowded and they venture out into "wilder territory". Why wait for a ski lift when you can have an entire mountain to yourself? Everything goes great until one of the guys falls badly and breaks his leg.Shunning common sense they decide to hold up in an old abandoned ski lodge in the middle of nowhere, to tend to the boys broken limb, and there the terror begins, as of course the lodge only "appears" to be abandoned.This picture treads the same ground as most other movies of the genre from this point filled with clich&eacute;s, and familiar situations to allow the hidden slasher to begin the body count at his/her/its leisure.What does work in this picture (and why I gave 4 stars) are good character development and a sharp script. As the viewer you actually begin to care about the five friends, unlike in years gone by when slasher movie actors were unknowns and like wooden cutouts, roaming around for no other reason than fodder to showcase a grisly demise.This aspect lends real tension to a lot of the scary scenes, and if you can forget about every picture that has retread this ground in the past, you will probably enjoy it.

Starring Ewan McGregor, and Albert Finney in an offbeat story about an estranged son who returns home to visit his dying father, and learns more about him by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. In a typical Tim Burton offbeat and colorful way, McGregor (playing his father as a younger man in flashback) helps the son (played by Billy Crudup) by re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows, the result of which is often funny but also beautifully poignant. Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.The main thrust of the script is how the initial "Fish Stories" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience.

This is an older title, that is now very affordable and well worth the money.Similar to may other games around at the moment, including the hugely popular Medal of Honor - you control a special unit of soldiers through around 12 or so levels across Europe during the latter part of WWII.An array of weapons, tasks and specialities are available to you as you equip up to 4 team members (picked from a choice of 12 for each mission)on each level, which progressively get harder and require more task solving. The &quot;Easy&quot; level is actually not that easy, and where the game scores, I feel is in believability (one head shot kills, for example). The only aspect of the game I found annoying was the inability to pre select tasks for the group members you don't control. As you can only carry out the actions of one member at a time, switching between characters is a little frustrating, and those not under your control tend to act of their own accord during the mission, if they are in the midst of the action. Hidden &amp; Dangerous was better from the point of view of being able to &quot;send&quot; other team members to specific areas, whilst you carried on with one, but this is still very enjoyable.Fans of this type of game will certainly feel that it is money well spent, and the game does keep your attention for many mnay hours (as long as you don't cheat). Definite two thumbs up!

I have visited the Blue Ridge parkway on many occasions, and purchased this as a reference for out of town visitors I intended to take there. The plan being for them to read it and select the places that appealed. Unfortunately this book offers very little, with the exception of a milestone planner which helped us find things as we travelled along. The truth is that the host of free publications you can collect along the way, or even now online were equally informative to both previous visitors and first timer alike. I'm sure there are many very good books on the subject out there, but this is not one of them. Save your money.

When you name a review "baffling" and it's by Terry Gilliam, most people who are familiar with his movies, would claim that as a pre requisite.I say it in two ways, first and foremost how you could get Christopher Plummer, Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law AND Colin Farrell in the same movie and be moved to indifference for the first hour of this movie.Secondly, it's baffling because it's really quite weird. That's not a complaint as such, as I said in the introduction, one can hardly call Terry Gilliam mainstream.Indeed, in todays fast buck mega pictures out to ream cash from the masses, it's refreshing to still see a filmmaker, who has the money (and the courage) to interpret on screen, what most of us confine to our nighttime dreams.Oversimplifying the film would be to say that the Devil (played with more than a dollop of dark charm by Tom Waits) as "Mr Nick" made a deal, or bet in an undisclosed distant past, with monk Christopher Plummer who gained immortality in the wager.Now years later, he runs a tin pan side show, where people can visit their "dreams" by stepping through his mirror (while he controls it with a trance) and he can help them shape their own world, and save their soul. Mr Nick in the meantime, usually appears in their dream world with a more appealing alternative (but worse conclusion) and the too and fro for souls, as you get the impression, has been battled out between them.Plummer, now an aged drunk has a soon to be 16 year old daughter Valentina (played with a pale but almost sexy fragility by Lily Cole) and a zealous apprentice Anton, again played amiably by another newcomer Andrew Garfield, and long standing advisor Vern Troyer (Austin Powers).We learn that in one of the two protagonists "deals" at some point, Parnassus (Plummer) fell in love, and had a child, which he must hand over to Mr Nick on her rapidly approaching 16th birthday, unless he can win a new "bet".Enter Heath Ledger, as an amnesiac apparent suicide victim, saved by our wandering troupe, who signs on to help Parnassus and company, reach the public, win the bet, and woo the daughter, much to the chagrin of Anton who has yet to announce his undying love to Valentina.Sounds interesting? Yes it does, and I had high hopes, not only to see Legder in his last performance, but I had also been more than impressed by the glitzy high profile trailer.But it's dull, I'm sorry but trudges through the first hour and in attempting to conjure up many visions of Parnassuses World, ends up a mess.There isn't any real tension even when the story gets going, Depp, Law, and Farrell are nothing more than wasted cameos, and even the twist at the end, isn't really gripping. By two hours in, I had lost any real compassion for any of the characters.I have long been a fan of Terry Gilliam, I thoroughly enjoyed the Brothers Grimm, and Brazil, but frankly this is not in that league.If you like bizarre out there movies, give it a go by all means.I didn't want to be mean, but 3 stars was as generous as I could be.

From the opening credits this film is more launched than introduced to the audience and doesn't really let up until the last tantalizing (go the the sequel) scene. Like the incredibly succesful Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Kill Bill was filmed all in one go, and originally intended as a single movie, (which would probably have been overlong).Being cleverly split into two volumes,the film flows incredibly well with solid continuity, but even more cleverly is the short 4 month gap between Vol 1 on DVD and the Vol 2 in theaters idea, to keep the film fresh, and the fans interested. It's difficult to use words like &quot;classic&quot; when describing Tarantino, but love him or hate him, you have to admire this piece of work which is certainly on a par with Pulp Fiction. One wonders whether the bankability of Tarantino's name is enough to draw an audience alone regardless of the material, without the added bonus of the viewer almost knowing what to expect before they walk into the movie theater. This must surely gives him the luxury of a virtually free hand in the creativity of the plot, characters, and the action, in fairly safe comfort of the knowledge that the picture will be well received. Kill Bill is a simple revenge story, and a pastiche homage to a slew of film genres, most notably the dubbed Kung Fu action movies of the 70's. From the cheesy Raymond Chow style movie credits to the breathtaking choreography, many in the know have even recognised the juxtaposition of individual scenes, from previous Chinese classics. The film is gloriously over the top, but not overacted. There is a strange reassurance to the strength of the lead performances, playing with such dead pan sincerity, amidst even the most farcical elements of the film, and the end result is a real treat. As usual the movie is littered with expletives, and whereas the violence content button seems to have gone into overdrive, the almost astral exaggeration of the fight and blood letting sequences, actually re-emphasise the fantasy of it all. It is extremely doubtful that this film would have had much success, or even exposure without Tarantinos credentials, but as it is, it's a great experience for fans and newcomers alike - sure to be a hit with Vol 2 already in Theaters.

Hugh Jackman takes the title role in this horror / action flick about Vampires, Werewolves and Frankenstein's monster, in an excellent recreation of 1880's Transylvania. I had my doubts as to just how all three legendary monsters would be incorporated into a single story, but the end result is very cleverly handled, written and directed. Making this kind of movie believable should never be the director's aim (considering the subject matter) but making it plausible should be, and one or two minor grumbles aside, Stephen Sommer's has done an excellent job in my opinion. Remaining true to many aspects of the original horror flicks of the 30's, but bringing a 21st century flavor, with some magnificent set design, and truly suspenseful sequences all add to the feel of the picture. The acting performances are strong, not only from Jackman, whose character is given a mysterious edge almost as strange as his quarry, but also Richard Roxburgh who is deliciously evil as the malevolent Count, and Kate Beckinsale as the heroine. Some clever comic relief from David Wenham as the knowledgeable bookworm friar, who accompanies Van Helsing on his mission, blends well with a very fast paced, and action packed story, and all the other performances are better than average. At 2hr and 25minutes this is not a short picture, but races along at such a speed, the viewer could be forgiven for thinking it was about 90 minutes. Some scary moments, and even scarier monsters (albeit CGI) ensure the R rating, but otherwise this is NOT a blood fest, or overly gory horror picture, and constantly remains faithful to the fantastical elements of the classic horror genre. I quickly forgave the unlikely portrayal of the hero's being able to take unbelievable physical punishment, and liked but felt the 007 style equipment lab a little misplaced at the beginning of the picture. These two minor points aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie. I gave it 5 stars as I couldn't give it 4.5. Great Fun!

This game is hard. You will die many times and have to keep playing the same level. That said, the game is incredibly addictive, has some of the best ambient noise around and the use of motion capture makes the soldiers move like real soldiers. The reason for the difficulty is the ultra-realistic one hit can kill you idea, combined with rather accurate enemy fire. Add to this some poor pathfinding on the part of your allies and avoiding casualties becomes extremely difficult. Also, there are some bugs in the game, but these can be fixed by downloading a patch. Strategy fans will enjoy this game immensely, but other people may get frustrated.

One of the better Marvel Comic / Movie crossovers of late with a powerhouse performance by Ron Perlman in the title role, who delivers the character which such panache, you can forgive the other disappointing aspects of the movie. A typical pulp storyline finds the birth of Hellboy by a Nazi ritual interuppted by well to do professor figure who he comes to know as father, and then we are moved hence 60 odd years. Hellboy is now on our side thankfully, but we are then only to find (shock horror) that the original protagonists have re-emerged to finish their aim of World destruction yada yada yada. Top heavy on the SfX as you would expect, but the success lies in the movies persistent, and almost self effacing script; that refuses to try and overlay a topical, or politically correct message, as so many other movies of the genre have in the past. The film seems to know it's implausible and often silly beyond belief, but the acting is perfectly executed. Any moments of stale screen time are soon enlivened with some beautifully delivered lines, again by Perlman, who almost single handedly carries the whole picture. A lot of fun here for young and old, and should appeal to those outside the 14-22 demographic for whom it seems to have been intended for by the director. Your intellect won't be tested too much, but if you know that going in, you should enjoy this movie. Deserves 3.5 stars, but not quite 4.

The wait is finally over as the closing chapter in this masterful Trilogy from Peter Jackson makes its DVD release, and boy was it worth it.For those who didn't see the movie on the big screen, this will be worth waiting for, and the 11 Oscars that were bestowed on it were more than well deserved, although I felt this was a reflection on the entire trilogy as a whole, and not just this last installment.I'm not one for plot spoiling so enough to add that Sam & Frodo continue there quest with Gollum in tow, whilst Aragorn tries to fulfill his destiny amidst an epic battle, and the culmination of the story from the last two movies is beautifully woven together. Maligned by some for being a little protracted toward the end, and running over 3hrs and 15 minutes this is certainly filmed on an epic scale. Some criticism from purists with regard to the transition from page to screen, were I feel also a little misplaced as this will surely become known as the definitive version of a great work of literature, and is in it's own right cinematic history at over 4 years in the making.This film (like the two that preceded it) has everything: - love, action, adventure, emotion, sadness and the list goes on. Superbly acted, directed, and written, I cannot recommend this film enough. Those who enjoyed the other movies will feel more than a little sadness at the end of this trilogy, which although it seemed frustrating at having to wait a year for each installment to come along, has left us without anything to seemingly look forward too. Some excellent DVD extra's on disc two, including the promotion of the extended version later this year round out the disc set well, and this will certainly be a worthy addition to any collection. Enjoy

This presentation is a fairly &quot;out of the box&quot; history channel style interpretation of the history of Troy, and covers most aspects of the story adequately. I couldn't help thinking that the production of this DVD was rushed in an attempt to cash in on the recent Movie release though, as the production quality has a distinct cheap and hurried feel to it. That having been said, what the program does show is that Troy is a Mythical story: added to and adapted over the centuries and based (albeit loosely) on the epic poem by Homer. Add to this the then various subjective interpretations of that piece of literature over the years, and then re translations by contemporary scholars and you can understand that historical &quot;accuracy&quot; is more of a best guess. Those people that are constantly complaining about the recent movie and other dramatic interpretations of this famous story should watch this and remember that fact.The DVD has little or no extra's but my copy is actually region free coded which was interesting, and certainly adds to the under $10 value. This isn't a great documentary, but it's not bad either and if you can endure the dry voiceover and basement production you will certainly find it's worth owning. Enjoy

July 1985, what a year that was! - and that's how this will make you feel. At the time I remember the endless drones of my elders comparing it to Woodstock in the 60's (their generations BIG concert event) and being less than complimentary. This is a very good value DVD set with over 10 hours of music, from some truly HUGE names in the business. OK, so some of the performances are missing, big deal - the main ones are there, including the unforgettable and crowd rowsing Queen set with Freddie Mercury whipping the throng into a frenzy. As others have said, these were bands and artists who cut their teeth in live venues, and without wanting to be to disparaging about a lot of modern bands, these people really CAN sing. Much more than a nostalgia trip, this is a must have for anyone who remembers the actual event, or who likes to wax on about "how music used to sound". Not many extra's in the set, but the re release creating more revenue for the charity is a nice touch. Probably wasted on a younger audience, but nonetheless an important musical event that has stood the test of time. I wonder if I'll be around in another twenty or thirty years to see a comparable performance that my kids will call their own "Big Gig". Great DVD at great price, and ideal Christmas gift. Enjoy!

A good amount of action and impressive CGI bolsters this remake which to be honest flags a bit at times.Even an A list cast, and Sam Worthington (fresh from Avatar and Terminator Salvation) unfortunately can't lift it above average.The usual debate ensues about the 3D added as an afterthought, and whether it adds anything, I saw the 2D version so can't comment on that, although I noticed a couple of scenes obviously deliberately designed with the 3D medium in mind.On a side note, if 3D is going to be the new gold standard, then please filmmakers, stop using every opportunity to have things fly out of the screen for a cheap effect. Avatar was good in 3D exactly because it did not exploit the audience, but I digress.Most people who remember Harry Hamlin et al in the 1981 original will not be able to help but make comparisons, and the storyline and chronology is quite similar.However, whereas I would not have said the original was a deep drama, it had a far more solid story, and makes this updated CGI festival pale in comparison.As much as I like Sam Worthington, he was wooden most of the time, pausing between action sequences to deliver "man against the Gods" speeches, which he fails to carry off each time with any conviction.The biggest difference in the two movies is of course that the first was a love story.Perseus, driven by his love for Andromeda (the beautiful and delicate Judy Bowker) has a passion, that is missing here somehow. As Perseus is merely on a vendetta against Hades.The feud and story with Calibos was much more integral to the plot than here also, where this time around that character seems to be little more than a disgruntled mercenary working for Hades.I'm not going to delve into the story any more than that, so no spoilers.It is a good two hours of escapism, and fun to watch Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus, and Hades respectively chewing up scenery at every given opportunity.Probably the last of the stop motion classics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.Sure to do well at the box office, it is a visual feast if nothing else, and although I don't agree with some of the scathing reviews it's received from the media, and film critics, it did fall short of my expectations. 3.5 Stars.

With the timing of this movie and "Book of Eli" being released so close together, and both dealing with a post apocalyptic, dystopian view of the future, it's difficult not to compare the two side by side. But whereas Eli, represents a more polished, Hollywood style approach, The Road is a dark, and dreary adaptation without any real moments of levity. Arguably, the book (which I have not read) doesn't translate too well here into a movie, you feel somewhat dropped in to a portion of the story, where the beginning is shown only in often confusing flashbacks without real explanation, and the rest of the story sort of meanders into desolation, but perhaps this is the intention. Like Eli, the film is heavily tinted, everything looks lifeless and grey, dead or dying, and the devastated landscapes and cities are very well portrayed. Mortensen as the main character, leading his son, on their trek "South" to the ocean, is as intense as ever, ragged, emotionally dogged, but resolute in survival, and tenacious in protecting his son from the horrors along the way.It's a difficult film to like, I would say that I would be unlikely to watch this again for a long time, so I was glad I rented it first. It's also not a film to cheer you up, and whereas that's sounds like an obvious comment considering the subject matter, like the film itself, it seems relentless in piling on the futility, and misery.So why 4 stars? Well the performances are excellent, particularly from Kodi Smit-McPhee as the son. It's also a lesson in humanity, where materialism and money has no value, a wake up call we could all do with from time to time. I also liked the tension and horror aspects of the movie, the marauding gangs, cannibalism and death being often played out off camera, or just with sound, not overtly graphic, but often even scarier most of the time.The message of the film, I can't say. It's quite slow and feels long despite being just two hours, and as I said at the beginning almost stops before the story ends.Difficult to categorize, but still a great movie on many levels.

I want to start by saying that like others I dislike the idea of the Ultraviolet digital copy, but that shouldn't be a reason to rate the actual movie one way or another, it would be like giving a one star review because you didn't like the cover art!.Now to the film, I saw this in HDX on VUDU, and enjoyed it...to a point.It's a complete change in direction from the first film, doesn't seem to follow on at all, and even the garbled comic book intro doesn't really resemble the events of the first movie.It's done in a different style for sure, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does have a rock video, muddled feel.Budget constraints obviously were in the driving seat, compared to the acting in the first movie, this is definitely worse, even Cage looks tired and bored most of the time, delivering lines as if they were on cue cards.The story is laughably stupid and predictable, and any actors of note who appear tend to plod through the thin script.All that said it has a ridiculous charm, this time out the Ghost Rider is much more of a diabolical maniac, and the transformation scenes with Cage trying to hold the beast back are a good laugh.Quite a bit of action, some very good special effects, especially on the VMax bike they used will please fans of the genre, and I suspect the choppy camera work, flicking in and out of black screen, and slow motion make it look and feel like a comic book storyboard.Locations for shooting are all Eastern Europe, again obviously driven by a small budget, and although the special effects are good, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous.I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, without the depth or story of the first movie for sure, but eye candy nonetheless.When I first saw the trailer for this last year, I had expected a big budget sequel, and I didn't actually see or here of a theatrical release, which after seeing what's on display might explain the straight to DVD production feel.3 stars, if you like this kind of stuff, it will generate a couple of hours of harmless fun, if you're looking for a meaningful sequel, don't bother.

If you aren't a fan of Tom Cruise you may think about giving this a miss, and that would be a real mistake, for this is arguably one of his best performances to date, from a versatile acting standpoint at least.This is Spielberg's retelling of the HG Wells classic story, and 50's Sci Fi movie of the same name, done with a modern direction, but nicely grounded in the aspects of the original literature.Cruise plays, an average Joe, who is estranged, or divorced from his wife and family, and almost reluctantly it seems takes them on alternate weekends, to fulfill his fatherly duties. He comes across as semi spoiled, embittered, and something of a slob, with very little in his home or life to offer either his teenage son, or his young daughter. During there visit, everyone begins to witness what appears as a terrific thunderstorm, and with inimitable human curiosity rush to get the best view. This thunderstorm is of course the beginning on the annihilation of mankind, under the direction of a huge Martian fleet of super vehicular tripods, and as everyone flees, we stay focused and Cruise and families escape efforts. Spielberg really does a great job with atmosphere, and real tension in the terror that begins to unfold, but it's not all CGI and blue screen. The balance of shattered human lives, anger, despair, irrationality and disbelief are almost tangible as you watch, and Cruise delivers an island of drama amidst the ocean of destruction. It's worth mentioning here the supporting cast who are great, particularly young Dakota Fanning as Rachel, and Tim Robbins as an underground survivor who has really gone off the deep end mentally, but helps the trio during their escape.I thoroughly recommend this movie, even if like me you have seen the original, read the book, or have the T-shirt! Polished from start to finish, I remained glued to the screen, and like most in the theater felt the chills every time I heard the Tripod deafening call!Great stuff - Enjoy!

Digital cameras, like computers approximately double in power and halve in price every 18 months. True, digital cameras are easy to use and fun to play with on your pc, but please save time and money, and don't be tempted by the promise (or price) of anything under 1 megapixel. This camera looks nice, and thats about it - grainy picture quality over 3&quot;x5&quot;, blocky resolution, and poor light enhancement. Do yourself a favour, and stick with a normal camera until you can afford to really experiment with something worthwhile.

Whether you are a fan, or just interested in the music of the Eagles, this is the book you need! More than 65 of their greatest and well known songs (including some rarer live performances) are laid out in sheet music form, showing chords, shapes, tempo and full lyrics. Very easy to follow and play, and not encumbered with pages of non relevant information, this is a pure musicians aid, rather than anything else. Alphabetical contents page helps you jump straight to selected favorites, and although some songs run over 6 pages in sheet form, which can be a little distracting and disruptive when trying to follow with guitar, this is a great buy. Anyone who has ever purchased individual songs in sheet form will also enjoy the exceptional value for money of this collection.

I've been a Scooby Fan forever, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this interactive game, the demo of which I had seen impressing me. Sadly though, despite a pretty accurate graphic detail the game is just too easy, and quickly loses it's appeal. The turn taking becomes frustrating rather quickly, and despite it's claimed multiple ending possibilities, this game won't come out of the box often. Good if you have younger children, but little for teens or older. Sorry Scooby, but this game could have and should have been better.

So where do you start, reviewing Avatar?Unless you've been living in a cave, you'll have heard it's an extravaganza of amazing special effects that cost $300 million. You've probably heard that "professional" reviewers have called the storyline weak, and the acting sub par.I saw it last night in 3D, which I imagine is how James Cameron envisaged having it watched. After the customary 10 minute eye adjustment the effect was incredible.I understand that over 2500 individual special effects were used, along with the most sophisticated computer aided graphics and even newly invented hardware (for example a camera where Cameron could see the actors fully rendered through the lens while filming) to give a "real" feel.And "real" it is, you come out of this movie thinking Pandora is a real place! And by the representation on screen Cameron has been there!This isn't Mos Eisley circa 1977, every creature here looks like it belongs on this planet (itself an eye popping vision) The Na'vi don't look plastic (like they appeared in early trailers) they look, move and act real before your eyes, it sounds corny, but you feel swept away into this new World, almost like it was a real planet discovered.The story was solid, I didn't find it weak, although to some it may appear simple, if I had to make a negative comment, it is predictable.Paraplegic Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) gets a chance to fill his recently deceased twin brothers shoes and "pilot" an Avatar (DNA home grown Na'vi human controlled) under the guidance of Scientist Sigourney Weaver and crew. Being a marine, he's also under the scrutiny (and allegiance) of Gung Ho Col. Quaritch (excellently played by Stephen Lang). A basic synopsis would be, Weaver wants to save the Na'vi and Pandora, Lang wants to help Selfridge and Co. (Giovanni Ribisi slimy as ever) "kill em all" and mine the ore under their sacred land, Worthington soon realizes he's playing for the wrong team, like I said it's a simple plot.That doesn't however make it weak.People are going to talk about this movie for a long time, from the sky high production costs, to the box office records it's sure to smash.People are also talking about the movies subtext, message, morality. Is it an allegory for invading foreign lands? Afghanistan? Iraq? Personally I doubt it, this movie has been mulling around in James Cameron's head since he saw George Lucas make Star Wars in the 70's, and has been itself over 10 years in production. The end result, a detailed, meticulous and believable Sci Fi like nothing you have seen before.At 162 mins, it's not short, but the movie is paced very well and feels the right length.The bottom line for me was an excellent, unusual and thought provoking epic that will stand up for many many years. If you can see it in 3D try to, or even IMAX 3D. If not just see it, but make sure you do, you won't forget it quickly. 5 stars.

As another reviewer pointed out, Frozen is not exactly a "horror" movie, despite being billed as one, but I guess that depends on your view of what makes a horror film? To me this was a sort of "open water" set on a ski lift. 3 young friends take the last ride up the mountain and get stuck on the ski lift, in the dark, knowing it's closed for a week. The tension, and scary aspect of the film comes from feeling for the characters, wondering how we would feel, left behind, no way down, dark, very cold, and bleak - truly a frightening prospect.The main characters are also not "serves them right for being idiots" run of the mill fodder, and there is no madman lose on the mountain (as in the excellent Cold Prey a few years back from Norway).Do you give up and die, try to get down and risk life and limb (and some questionable wolf attacks) and do you learn that you have to work together to survive.At a sneak over 90 mins it's long enough without ever being boring, and there is plenty of tension throughout. The 3 young actors play their parts very well on screen, and the cinematics are impressive and remind us how insignificant we all are compared to nature.Well worth watching, and far better than a lot of dross currently around billed as horror movies. 4 stars

I have to smile while reviewing this as to the name "Holy" clearly due to it's revered nature, and long history in alternative medicine. I just wondered if it would sell as readily had it been called "Pagan" Basil or "Satanic" Basil, but I digress.This is a clearly subjective review, for me I noticed little or no effect from this homeopathic supplement, except some occasional "flowery" reflux.That's not to say for one second that I discount "alternate" supplements, or remedies (don't we all take vitamins?)I did however read recently that the much fancied Ginko Biloba has now been proven to have zero benefit to mental ability or warding off dementia in the elderly as was once thought to be a benefit, so I always remain a little skeptical about natural remedies.However, there is a lot to be said for natural products, although one must realize that what works in nature, may not always benefit 21st century lifestyles.I'm also a firm believer in the subjective belief in these products. How many times have we heard stories about people who have given up on recognized modern medicine only to be cured, or comforted by alternate and homeopathic treatments?Over simplifying maybe, but if you BELIEVE it's working, chances are it probably will, in some way or other.Be mindful of allergic reactions (always a necessity with plant based supplements) but by all means give it a try.I only gave it 3 stars as for me it did nothing really, maybe I'm too skeptical, I don't know.At a little of 35cents a tablet, it seems a little pricey, but then again, prescription medication is not exactly cheap.

I bought this CD for the first track entitled &quot;Dreams are Ten a Penny&quot; which I remember listening to as a child, and loving. Kincade were something of a sensation in the mid 70's in Germany in particular (where I first heard it) and I was therefore a little confused when trying to search the web for their material.Having listened to the entire collection, I quickly understood why their quantum leap to stardom had never been realized, and without wanting to be too damning, have to say this stuff is pretty lame. I still love the song I bought the album for, but that's about it - the rest of the album is a mish mash of covers and simplistic lyrical arrangements, that wouldn't be out of place in an elevator. Sure to bring back memories for some, and reflecting a time of big hair, session bands, and teen girl swooning tosh, there really isn't much to get excited about. If you are having difficulty getting hold of a particular track you may have to buy this (as I did) but otherwise give it a miss.

I have not been to Italy for many years, and then mainly in the Northern Tyrolean region of Vipitino on a drive from Austria over the spectacular Brenner Pass.I was therefore pleased to find it's (and the entire surrounding region) covered in depth in this guide, which is excellent for getting "off the beaten track". Make no mistake, it also has very comprehensive and detailed city guides in the more "classic" tourist regions, including helpful and easy to follow eating out guides for all tastes and wallet sizes!Italy is a beautiful country, criss crossed with a maze of road and rail networks, public transport systems and motorways that allow ease of travel whether you are renting your own vehicle, or using their transport (recommended).It's just a personal observation, and each to their own, but I find it sad that tourists and foreign visitors only often visit Rome, or Venice, or Milan, or Pisa and miss a lot in between. If you are on a structured stop style vacation or staying in a single city or region then I would suggest one of lonely planets equally excellent but more specific guides like Lonely Planet: Rome City Guide. That's not to say that this book won't serve you well, it's just a bit like taking the whole map, when you may only need one area.Excellent 8th edition, 5 stars.

I only gave this 3 stars which may seem mean, but I found it impractical and badly designed for several reasons.1) It's large, if you use a desk, even with a flat screen it takes up a lot of room just to hold your keyboard and looks cluttered.2) The wrist pad is not very soft, it's also cheaply attached with sticky back Velcro strips which are not easy to line up.3) 2 of the four adhesive foot pads for elevating the platform were glued to their supposedly removable sticky peel offs, and I couldn't use them.4) It looks cheaply made.I suppose if you have the room, it's OK for someone who likes to have the keyboard elevated at an angle, but without even any room for a mouse pad (must be purchased and added separately) I didn't like it that much. I also thought it was quite expensive for what it is.

110 minutes of tense, sobering (borderline ridiculous in places) action drama with a top notch cast, that gets bogged down in it's own multi threaded storyline. This is an entertaining cat and mouse bad guy / good guy? on the run from the government, hiding a bigger more sinister plot type yarn - it's of a similar style to movies like Fugitive, and the more recent Body of Lies, but goes it's own (muddled at times) direction and is originally dramatic. All that said it tries to cover every angle of post 9/11 Terrorism fears and misinterpretations, and ends up a bit of a mess in places. You have the stereotypical CIA agent who's bigoted and roughs up suspects, and another with a PhD in Arabic Studies preaching tolerance. There are fanatical Islamics and Terrorists and also thinking Muslims. Being an American production, US foreign policy is only ever alluded too, or hinted at, Oil, Iraq and War don't get a mention for instance. Holding all this together is Don Cheadle, excellent and believable as ever as the main character Samir Horn. With an American Mom, Sudanese Father, highly trained skills learned in the Special Forces and strange allegiances that are ambiguous at best, you know you're in for a treat, as he is chased by (among others) the aforementioned PhD CIA Agent, played by Guy Pearce. I gave it four stars for a solid storyline, good action scenes, and top notch acting all round. I would have given it five, it it hadn't had tried so hard to represent EVERY possible angle and ideology on a very tangled subject.

It's nice to find a kids animated show that has short enough episodes to keep even a toddlers attention span, fun and inventive stories, often with a moral, and also some subliminal education. As a parent I often despair at what I consider stupid animation aimed more at young adults than children. Wubbzy has the mix about right, and with the pedigree of Nick Jr behind it, you know that your child won't be watching anything questionable. There are 6 episodes, plus 2 bonus ones for a combined run time of 92 mins, which is pretty good value. There are some interactive features too, some printable stuff for your pc, a music video and a game. For those kids learning French there is also a French language track. Overall 4 stars. My 4 year old loves it, whereas my 5 year old (soon to be six) probably needs something more involved.For relatively "wholesome" viewing for 2 - 5 year olds though this is a winner.

It's very difficult to describe Bronson, and even harder to pigeon hole it into a specific category or genre. Hailed a new "Clockwork Orange" is a bit misleading, as it doesn't really deal with an overall dystopian view of wild indoctrinated youth, more so one individuals sad spiral into mental self awareness of an inner voice. Although highly stylized, it's also overall, quite a sad depiction of infamous British criminal Michael Peterson, (renamed Charlie Bronson by his bare knuckle fight promoter boss and former inmate Lenny McLean)For me, it's extremely easy to relate to growing up in 70's England, as a young man with few options (they were hard times all round, with high employment, and a nation still suffering under the machinations of the government of the day). The filming locations and set designs are authentic, and the sense of poverty and misdirection almost tangible.What follows is "based" on a true story, a more accurate description would be to say it's based upon Petersons own biographies and books written while incarcerated, and then polished with a lot of poetic license by director Nicolas Wefn.A boy from a lower middle class but nonetheless stable background, Peterson displayed violent tendencies from a young age, and a slow burn feel of inevitability that he would become the nihilistic man of the title.However, from a criminal point of view, Bronson was far more of a criminal inside prison than out. A bungled hold up at a post office brought him a 7 year term, he never actually killed anyone (as he states quite clearly during the movie), and from there begins the immergence of the inner man. After the torment of his first sentence he is freed, even falls in love, and bounces around between his eccentric uncles 70's style opium den (much red lights and heavy drapes inside a projects style apartment high rise) and bare knuckle brawling against men and even dogs!Still searching for an unknown ambition, "I only ever wanted to be famous" voices actor Tom Hardy in the title role, and like so many people of his generation his aspirations were common for men of his age, although they did not know exactly how or what they would become famous for.Knowing his true place is back inside he quickly recommits and returns to prison, and sets about countless hostage taking, and guard beating episodes, each one gaining him more notoriety.He now begins to believe, his chance at glory lies in infamy, on the inside as a feared convict. His achievements were realized when he was labeled by the British press (and other sources) as "Britain's most Violent criminal"Still in prison today, he has spent more than 30 years in solitary confinement for his continuous violent behavior.I'll stop here to add that Tom Hardy is amazing in what must have been a difficult role. Far removed from Praetor Shinzon in Star Trek Nemesis - now appearing much older physically, he has matured, and certainly beefed up for the role. But the strength of the performance lies in the depth of the portrayal.The monosyllabic narration scenes that seem to join sections of the story together draw you in and keep you compelled to watch and you believe the story. Hardy exudes an almost palpable menace, as he flicks from deep thought and introspective silence, even sadness to a violent boiling rage in the blink of an eye, truly scary.The violent scenes are unflinching and brutal, though not overdone or gratuitous. They are also unwavering in how they portray the futility of Bronson's actions, reinforcing his inner turmoil.Quite short at 92 minutes, it is nonetheless a powerful biopic, regardless of how accurate the material.I felt great sympathy for the character (which probably sounds misplaced for someone who attacked, injured and brutalized many prison guards) but the Director (and Hardy) elevate the story to a level above just violence.The scenes where he returns to his parents new smaller home now replete of his childhood belongings show an undercurrent of helpless, almost childlike loss and sadness for example.The film flicks between the narration and story scenes to Hardy playing out his life on a make believe music hall stage to a willing audience, giving a dreamy quality that probably prompted the comparisons to Kubrick, and Clockwork Orange.Accomplished author, artist and sculpture on the one hand, vicious psychotic thug on the other, that never lets you know when he will flick from one to the other makes for memorable (if not always easy) viewing. 4 stars.

Tender deep lyrics, line up next to Ho Down stomping up beat tunes on this wonderful album. The title track that was a top selling single and many other tracks herein mark a real step in the right direction for Toby. Not that his previous offerings were in any way poor, but the mixture of tempo's, lyrical content, and great instrumentals seems to elevate him to the next level. If you have never heard of Toby Keith, or your thinking of sampling his music - BUY THIS ALBUM.

Unlike Europe where instant coffee is a huge and diverse marketplace, with Nescafe, Krona, Douwe Egberts, Maxwell House and more having umpteen products available, here in the USA there is very little choice. I'm not going to get into the instant vs. real coffee debate here, and this is an instant, so don't expect a Starbucks red eye latte. For convenience and taste however, there is no comparison to Mount Hagen (which is made in Germany incidentally) - Nescafe Gourmet series probably comes in a close second, but flavor and aroma wise this is head and shoulders above Folgers and Community brands of instant coffee, or any others for that matter. More and more people are drinking less and less coffee (we're all trying to be healthy remember?) so if you don't want to have the coffee pot on the hot plate all day, and can't afford a one cup at a time Keurig, give this a try. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but until we have some others available in the USA to compete, I'll pay it. 5 Stars.

You could be forgiven after 15 minutes of this movie for opting for some emergency dental work without anesthesia as a substitute, as it is probably the worst Steven Seagal offering to date. This movie is already being aired on network television, which gives you some idea of the kind of draw (and audience) the producers were expexting to attract. Seagal spends most of the movie clad in black (to hide his ever expanding bulk) and plays a government agent(yawn) who is double crossed and has to save the day, kill all the baddies, and exact revenge on his employers. Formula nonsense with plenty of gratuitous violence, bone crunching fight scenes, and acting performances straight out of the box (cardboard that is). Somebody needs to tell Mr Seagal to call it a day!

This product is quite simply excellent.On the down side it's a little expensive, but when you consider your health, is cost really an issue?I used this on my children in 80-90F Mid West USA heat, so it wasn't tested in very hot climates, and I used it sparingly, and mostly on their faces (to supplement a more mainstream all over factor 50 for the rest of them). It goes on evenly, easily and quickly without the sticky residue or mess of old fashioned "total blocks" like Zinc Oxide cream that people used to plaster on their noses and look silly all day.It's hypoallergenic, and more importantly works exceptionally, even during exercise and swimming, and it was nice to see them without the tell tale red cheeks after a day out swimming, they have always had with other facial sunblocks.Factor 58? well, I've seen even Factor 85 recently, but even if you don't know anything about the subject the enclosed literature is easy to understand without blinding you with science.I highly recommend this product, especially if you are travelling to hotter climates including the Caribbean, and places nearer the Equator, where it is much easier to get sun burn.As already said, a little expensive, but you get what you pay for. Excellent results.

The best shoot em up to date. This game has it all, weapons, excellent interaction, gameplay and some great missions.The skill level increases as the game progresses, giving an addictive feel. Brutal and gory this is not for children, but should keep Quake fans busy for hours if not days. If you want to buy one game this year, make it this one.

I purchased this tub after returning a different one which was more expensive, and much more inferior.My daughter was a premature baby, so the sling was a brilliant addition, and helped me bath here easily in the first 6 weeks. The reclined position and Upright are nice features, but there is a tendency for the baby to slip around, even with little baby wash in the water, and you will find yourself having to steady them constantly. I know some people who have had problems with the reclined position with some children, but simply adding an inflatable bath pillow behind them, makes life a lot easier. I really don't think there is a "perfect" tub out there, but for the money this is one of the best I've seen, and used. My daughter is now 6 months old and loves here bath time, and I think one reason for this is the padded back support, and ample leg room. Stores easily, fits most sinks, and ultra lightweight - a baby product that will last, without breaking the bank.

Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis, as Elvis Presley, and JFK respectively, do their best to lift a script with more holes than a block of swiss cheese, in this low grade Indy flick from Don Coscarelli. The idea of Elvis being alive and well (having traded places with an impersonator for want of a peaceful life free from the trappings of fame), and ending up dishevelled, and more than a little cynical in a crumbling Texas rest home certainly scores on the originality front, but thats about it really.. The only person who of course believes him is Ossie Davis as the ex president JFK, personified as an old black man, after the government had him "dyed" to aid the cover up, and the two men set about solving a mystery that is claiming the lives of the rest home residents. What could have been an intentionally camp comedy/horror with a side order of pathos, is sadly lacking in too many areas to be memorable. The director has obviously tried to incorporate some poignant drama and side comment about old age, forgotten relatives, and rest homes, but whereas this is a nice idea, it gets lost in the morass of plot ideas that fall over each other throughout the movie. Unlike "Army of Darkness" it's difficult to really catagorize this movie, and as it trys to be too many things, it ends up being none, the comedy aspect tepid and dilute at best. Bubba Hotep is actually a reincarnated Cowboy Mummy roaming the run down halls looking for lost souls after he was stolen from a museum, and the bus he was on crashed in a river near (you guessed it) the rest home where the movie is set. What must have appeared to be a "good idea" on paper, just isn't - the end product is niether scary, tense, or really very funny, and that's a real shame. I desperately wanted to like this movie more, but I have to say they are many many better ways to spend 92 minutes. Quite a lot of extra's on the DVD add some interest, but rent before you buy.

I have to be honest on that I was less than impressed by the first Tinkerbell movie, the huge apparent difference from the original Peter Pan movie, and the computer generated animation. I'm also a little skeptical on these "straight to DVD" releases, which are usually of inferior quality, and often akin to the TV animated series (the second and third Aladdin movies immediately spring to mind). This time around they have done it right however, with wonderful storytelling and engaging characters. I'm reviewing the Blu-Ray here specifically and have to say that the picture quality is amazing.I have a lot of Disney movies (I have a ready audience in my 5 and 6 year old) and even on high quality equipment to upgrade to 1080i with the standard DVD's there is no comparison. The images are crisp, clear and eerily realistic, even for computer animated graphics, the sound quality is also flawless.Often these sequel type movies have a paper thin story padded out with songs and eye popping graphics, but here the story is well told, and engaging, even for younger viewers. There's enough to keep the adults attention as well, without the usual "two level" humor, so often seen to attract the older viewers.The synopsis above is fairly comprehensive, so I won't go into the story, but parents watching will enjoy seeing Tinkerbell embrace life lessons such as the value of friendship, and responsibility for her acts and omissions.A great voice talent cast including Angelica Houston gives a polished feel to the whole thing, and I believe there will be plenty of repeat viewing.5 stars for the picture and sound quality that makes a great story even better.

Stallone et al deliver a throwback homage to the action movie genre. Trying to rekindle some of the movie styles that have these days become post Matrix, Bourne style choppy fast camera fights and dramas, that you need to replay to enjoy.The movie isn't bad, on the one hand it's totally shameless with the line up, adding Schwarzenegger and Willis to the "Starring" line up is a joke really, they are on screen for about 3 minutes of dialogue, and that's it, hardly noteworthy. Surprised they didn't have someone watching an old movie clip so they could have added "starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman" to the line up, but I digress.It's a fairly simple story, the movie opens with an unconnected rescue scene to introduce us to Stallone's team of "Expendables" dealing with some Somalia pirates on a ship somewhere with hostages (very topical)plenty of gun play and action to whet the appetite so to speak.We then get a deeper perspective of the main characters, particularly Stallone and Statham, as they undertake a "overthrow dictator and rescue innocents" mission in some made up island "in the gulf" - In the gulf? - which gulf, I mean come on people, details please even if it's made up.Of course the mission is a lie, to aid CIA drug shenanigans, and the team have to figure out the good guys from the bad guys, and so on.For me, here's where the film split, and annoyingly so.If you want to make an out and out testosterone flick (the original Predator, or Rambo springs to mind) do so. Don't add in padding scenes like Mickey Rourke getting all misty eyed and introspective about old missions, and the mental and emotional cost of "war is hell".Ultimately, the film tries not to be a mindless action drama, but after the meandering script dips it's toe into heartfelt character building, the movie explodes into a killing spree where just about everyone gets beaten, shot or blown up in the last 20 minutes anyway.They are a few moments of levity, some tongue in cheek action sequences, and some downright good action scenes, but it felt like Stallone couldn't make up his mind between action, and a thinking mans drama, and ended up delivering neither.Statham carries the whole movie for me, most of the other characters are in there for just the fighting scenes, and have little character development, but then again didn't really need any I suppose.It's an OK movie, definitely worth seeing, to find out what all your friends who have seen it are chatting about, but not destined to be a classic I fancy.Stallone has proved if nothing else that he's pretty good these days in the executive producers chair, maybe he should there. 3 stars

It's quite sad that a movie that was released in 2007 takes until October 2010 to get a BD release here, especially when it's this good. I guess that's not unusual for European films, especially subtitled ones, which it's deemed by someone to not be mainstream enough for US audiences?The story was broken up into two movies in 2007, and 2008 originally so to get the "whole" story so to speak, is almost worth the wait, albeit in truncated form.That being said, apparently the original version ( a truly lavish scale of production by European standards ) was released initially in a Mini Series format running about 6 hours in total, much like the original German version ofDas Boot - The Original Uncut VersionTo date, no plans have been made to make this version available, and although it is possible to get the original two movies - ARN: The Knight Templar, and ARN: The Kingdom at Roads End on DVD, they are hard to find, and in PAL format, or region 2 coded.Arn (played by Joakim Nattergvist) is based on the trilogy of books by Swedish author Jan Guillou, and although I have not read the books, I consider this adaptation to be a rare treat for fans of the genre.It's easy to quickly draw many comparisons with movies like "Kingdom of Heaven", and even the Lord of the Rings trilogy in some ways, partly due to the fact that the movie is so well made. The acting is great throughout, the locations impressive, and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.Some will feel that the battle scenes are scant, even though they are done on a grand scale, but the story is about the struggle, not just the fighting.It's a story of two parts really.A young boy growing up in 12th century Sweden is taken by his parents to a monastery as he has an illness, and is not expected to reach adulthood.While there, he is taken under the wing of a monk who previously "served God" in the holy crusades, and he nurtures Arn's apparent natural talent with weapons to teach him the finer arts of fighting, swordplay and archery - something the youngster takes to well, aided by the fact he is naturally ambidextrous.Historically, much of Europe around the time the movie is set, was not as geographically delineated as it is today, many countries were a loose collection of warring fiefdoms, vying for power, land and the throne, and Sweden was no exception. It is during one such encounter that while defending his fathers honor, he makes an enemy of the powerful Svenger clan.Against the wishes of his family, the young Arn also falls in love with Cecilia, the daughter of a local family betrothed to the Svenger clan to help cement an alliance between the two most powerful families trying to control the country.Through lies and scorn he is sent to the Holy Land as a Crusader to do penance for 20 years, while his young bride to be is sentenced likewise for 20 years in a local convent, run by a vicious Abbess, who is sympathetic to the Svenger clan.Half of the movie centers on her struggle and life in Sweden, and the other on Arn's arduous and battle ridden path through the Holy land.I'm not going to go into much more detail than that really, and that's about as much information you would get from the movie trailer anyway, so not really a spoiler.Compressing three books into one movie, that runs just under two and a quarter hours, I'm sure will leave some plot holes for people who have read the books, but to me it felt very complete.It's also going to feel a little slow to some people, this movie is as much about love and family as it is about fighting and the crusades.despite these two points, I strongly recommend seeing this movie.There are those who will be put off by subtitles, although a large portion of the movie is in English. What is particularly well done is that all the characters speak their own language, Arabic, French, Swedish and English, clearly stated on screen with the subtitles, so it's easy to keep up.There are a few familiar faces US viewers will probably recognize, not least Stellen Skarsgard, but most I'm sure like me will be amazed that they haven't seen Joakim Nattergvist in anything before.This is top notch acting, whichever way you look at it, from the whole cast but particularly him.Focused, driven and really believable in the role, he seems to embrace all aspects of Arn's character.This feels to me like old fashioned story telling, with modern technology kept to a minimum. It feels "Epic"If you like this kind of movie genre, see this film. 5 stars

The movie opens with Gerard Butler beaten and tied watching his wife being raped and murdered, and a (thankfully behind closed doors) insinuation that his young daughter has met a similar fate after a home invasion by two thugs.Roll the clock forward to see the broken Butler witness the ADA (Jamie Foxx) cut a deal to virtually free one of the assailants for evidence to bury the other, and explain to the grief stricken Butler, that some justice is better than none.You've seen the trailers, and probably professional reviews, and this looks like a straightforward revenge movie, and it pretty much is, only while trying to be more, and make more social comment, it quickly goes awry.Any sympathy I felt for Butler's character vanished half way through the movie when he begins systematically killing anyone and everyone he can to get back at ADA Foxx, and bring down the flawed legal system. Your initial horror and sympathy begins to wane when you watch him tie up and torture someone to death, the end result making him as psychotic and unbalanced as the men who killed his family. And who knows, maybe that's the message of the movie, that grief and revenge can tip you over the edge? Or is the message that the legal system doesn't work? Whichever it is, it would have been better to channel those ideas into just making a movie, and not being a "clever" director by telling us what's wrong with the World. Most of us already know thanks.At least most of the movie is feasible, even if it's unlikely. 10 years have passed since the trial, time enough for Butler to set his master-plan into action. The situations and schemes are believable, especially when we find out (of course) that Butler was a former CIA/FBI agency whatever, whose specialty was making people dead, even unreachable people.It's a pretty good taut thriller, predictable, but very watchable with some top notch acting all round. Perhaps 3 stars is a little mean, it just could have been better.

This game has been around for some time, but the PC graphic quality and gameplay stack up against anything new out there. Very simple to play, but extremely challenges as the game progresses, this will keep you occupied for quite some time. There are those who will complain that &quot;It's not as good as&quot; but if you want some inexpensive fun, this is a very good platform adventure game, that is better in many ways than a lot of it's rival titles

Queen 40 years, that was 2011, the reissues, the box sets, books and documentaries, all flooding the market.Among them this little documentary gem, released in the UK (mid January 2012 release date set for here in the US) on region free Blu ray disc.There has been some consternation about the fact that the BD runs longer than the trimmed DVD release, and I can offer no insight. The BD has nice picture and sound, but is by no means stunning, most of the footage shown in the documentary is old and not restored, or upgraded to HD, so it's a good picture, not a stunning one.The main feature is a two part documentary charting the beginnings of the band, through to their last live performance in 1986, and then what came next.Most of the footage is narrated in interview style with Brian May, and Roger Taylor mostly. John Deacon (the bass player) seeming to have disappeared intentionally from the public eye, is not seen much, and the footage of Freddie is obviously old.There is quite a bit of new footage, some unseen screen tests for videos, and the unseen live aid practice, all padded out with a chronology of hits, shows, ups and downs.It was interesting to learn about some of the inner turmoil, the quiet solo attempts, not only from Freddie, but Brian and Roger also.There are many interesting interviews with the likes of Paul Gambucinni, long time roadie Peter Hince, and their former manager, as well as news reports, clips covering the highs and the lows.The immense crowds of South America, the mistake of Sun City, the long time break through to the USA, and so on.The second part of the documentary deals with the high points, virtual split and then masterful reunion for Live Aid, and the massive '86 tour.It also deals with Freddie's health, decline and ultimate end, and though delicately handled, it is sad and very bittersweet.So 40 years? Well yes and no, 25 years since their last live concert as a complete band, and 20 years since the death of Freddie, yet here we are - still absorbed, still watching.Arguably one of the greatest rock bands of the 20th century, certainly one, if not THE founders of "stadium" rock, who left an endearing legacy of great music.Much of the the footage can be seen in other documentaries likeQueen - Under Review - 1980-1991andQueen - Under Review 1973-1980but these are mostly the ramblings of other people. This BD has probably the most real input from the band, mostly Roger and Brian as already mentioned, but for any fan, or anyone who simply wants to know more about the band, it's certainly worth the money.

Ok, so this movie may not be to everyones taste, and it does have some problems, but on the whole I found it light hearted, often funny, and somewhat of an uplifting romance caper. Paul Bettany plays an old man in a young mans game, in this his last Wimbledon tournament as a "wild card" entry, before fading into obscurity as a Tennis Pro for a nouveau riche London country club. Enter Kirsten Dunst, as a vibrant young superstar in the making, fiercely guarded by coach and father Sam Neill, who has aspirations for her to be the next big thing. An unlikely chemistry appears between these two very different players, who almost fall unwittingly fall into a pre match "workout" style fling. His game improves ten fold, whilst hers begins to suffer under the unwelcome (as seen by her father) distraction of a boyfriend of any kind. One or two little tiny comic subplots lace the back story, and we are kept guessing as to the outcome of it all, however apparent it may seem to begin with. Is Ms Dunst just having fun? Is this love at first stroke? Will she lose? Will he win against all odds? Much fun is had along the way at a little under two hours in an old fashioned love tug sort of way, with some inventive camerawork and direction, and wonderful cameos from the likes of John McEnroe, and Chris Evert. Bettany is excellent, and a believable tennis pro (considering he couldn't play before filming) and although Ms Dunst hardly has to delve into her acting bag of tricks, the film has more in the merit than complaints department, for me anyway. Probably not huge on the repeat viewing scale once you know the end of the movie, but if you are looking for some clean romantic fun, a good story, and good acting, look no further. 4 stars is a little generous, but still a lot of fun. Enjoy

This put quite simply is a great book. It's easy to read, very user friendly, and don't be put off by the fact that it is just over 165 pages.Fans of Tolkein (myself included) will enjoy this book tremendously for several reasons.1) It's bang up to date, and incorporates comparisons between the new movies, and the original text2) It's fairly chronological in helping even the newest visitor to Tolkeins World's, gain some understanding3) It's unbiased, unopinionated, and objective in its explanations.But above and beyond all of this it is one of the few recent books that has NOT fallen into what I refer to as &quot;shameless commercialism&quot;. Whether you know all of Tolkeins works backwards, or have only seen the recent hit movies - this will help you enjoy one of the finest works of fiction of the 20th Century (and it was others far more eminent than me who said that). I first read the Hobbit in 1975 and have been a fan of Tolkein ever since, but since the enormous success of the wonderful recent and upcoming movies have been saddened by the seemingly endless line of &quot;experts&quot; offering in depth and (in their opinion) inciteful explanations as to the mind, the work, and the &quot;hidden&quot; messages of Tolkeins texts. There are a lot of worthless products out there at the moment simply trying to cash in and ride the gravy train - I'm happy to recommend this book, as NOT one of them. Enjoy.

Seems to be a lot of bad reviews about "nobody's" in this film.Richard Roxburgh - Van Helsing, Mission Impossible II, Moulin RougeIoan Gruffudd - Fantastic 4, Amazing Grace, W., HornblowerAlice Parkinson - The Pacific, X-Men Wolverine, Where the Wild Things AreHousehold names they may not be to some, but nobody's, they are not and in truth, the director probably needed a few good, fit and flexible actors for this demanding movie.It's tense, claustrophobic and well paced on the good side. On the bad side it's cliched and predictable. But no more so than a lot of movies about right now.Anything with James Cameron's name attached to it is going to draw interest, and probably unreal expectations. Avatar this is not, nor even the caliber of The Abyss.All that said, this "inspired by true events" movie is worth seeing in my opinion. The character interactions, life and death scenarios and sheer palpable feel of the underwater scenes make it worth it.Not a new story, cave diving team get trapped by weather, must go down and in, to get out. Unknown territory, virgin caves, cold, wet and the inevitable power struggles between high flying playboy (Gruffudd) and grizzled pro (Roxburgh), who's trying to save the team, and reconcile with his son keeps the story moving forward. Like I said it's cliched.At 108 mins it feels about the right length, and whereas it's not a movie I would shell out to buy, or pump up to the 3D version (the 2D Blu Ray looked pretty good to me)It's worth a look. 3 stars

I played the demo of this game, and quickly realised that I would not be paying for the full version.I think it's a reflection of the game that used versions are currently selling at very low money, and it is a real shame, when this game COULD have been a winner.You are a secret agent type assassin given several tasks that involve thinking and sneaking around, instead of the usual guns blazing approach, and the graphics, levels, enemies, weapons, and scenarios are actually very very good. There is ONE big problem however, you CAN'T SAVE your progress as you go. Even if you play this game on the easiest level,you will find it very frustrating. There is a fine line between a game that isn't easy to beat, and one that's annoying as anything, and this one jumps that line with size 12 boots. You will find yourself playing for a long time, reaching so far in a level and then getting killed off, only to go back and start from scratch. I hope the programmers have learned from their mistakes as I see a sequel is now available. If you really like this kind of game, try &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; instead, it's much more rewarding.

As a lifelong fan of the band, I am bound to be biased in my review, but I was very excited to see a concert from the last tour in '86 (as a complete band) on Blu-Ray.Whereas I liked Montreal, my favorite has always been the Wembley set - which is almost identical here.The picture is as clear as I have ever seen footage of the band, and the sound was crisp.I wasn't particularly fond of the inter cutting scenes on each band member wondering around Budapest, having a "moment".I would have rather this had been an optional feature on the disc, not played in the middle of a song, but that's just me.With regard to the Wembley concertQueen: Live at Wembley StadiumI live in hope that this will be given the restoration treatment and put onto Blu Ray - I'm sure it would certainly sell well.Comparing that concert to this is not difficult, but for me the audience are flatter here, whether it's the camera work (which is great of the band) focusing on the band members more, and the crowd participation and reactions less I can't tell, but Wembley feels more immersive.Another minor gripe, I don't know why Another One Bites the dust was left off the Blu Ray, or why Crazy little thing called love was heavily trimmed in the edit??The impromptu bits, Brian's solo, and the very touching Hungarian song Freddie sings, are going to change depending on the location, obviously - but as for the song set, can't we have it all and complete?Shelling out for this set will also give you two CD's of the gig, the less said about the crappy cardboard gate-fold sleeve the better.Obviously a must for fans, for people new to Queen's music, I would recommend Wembley over this.
