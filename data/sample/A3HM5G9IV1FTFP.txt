I knew within the first thirty seconds of the first track of this CD that I was going to love it. It was sort of the music-listening equivalent to "you had me at hello". The energy of this CD is so fresh and so intoxicating that it made me feel like I just drank a Red Bull.M.I.A. is an artist who is difficult to classify, which means that she is a true original. Her music has the bravado of hip-hop, the experimental quality of electronica, the multi-cultural vibe of world music. Yet it doesn't come across as pretentious or forced at all. She's just taking what she needs to turn herself on. And the listener (me) is turned on in return. Isn't that what music is all about?

I'm stunned that I had never heard of this excellent film until discovering it by accident (on a friend's coffee table while housesitting). What I thought might be an intersting little drama actually turned out to be a powerful, devastating and engrossing film. Filled with powerhouse actors, this film shows the affect a vicious murder has on a variety of people, from the stranger who discovers the body (Toni Colette), to the dead girl's naive, devastated mother (Marcia Gay Harden) to the doomed, damaged girl herself (Britney Murphy). Every one of the film's vignettes is both brutal and tender, filled with stories of desperation, sex, death and redemption. This is easily the best film of its kind I've seen since "Monster's Ball". Why didn't this film get more attention? It deserves it.

Of all four of Garbage's albums, "Version 2.0" is probably my favorite. The title itself seems to suggest that the band wasn't really going for a big departure from the sexy post-grunge/techno hybrid they created on their debut, just trying to take the sound to the next level, and I think they accomplished this in spades. "Version 2.0" is a tighter, leaner, meaner, more cohesive album than its predecessor. The crunchy guitars, abrasive beats, and slick production, combined with Shirley Manson's sexy-yet-damaged vocals, make "Version 2.0" an album that brilliantly straddles the line between rock and dance, and between pop and alternative.Highlights: The self-deprecating sexiness of "I Think I'm Paranoid", the sinister heavy breathing of "Hammering in my Head" and "Push It", the melancholy "You Look So Fine."

Gus Van Sant is a difficult and unpredictable director. He can pull off a quirky dramatic masterpiece like "My Own Private Idaho", or a hilarious, deranged satire like "Die To For" with equal aplomb. With "Elephant", he created an ingeniously naturalistic style that made the Columbine-like climax to the film even more powerful. Sadly, that same naturalistic style does not work nearly as well in "Last Days". By depicting a series of tedious, excruciating moments leading up to the suicide of rock star "Blake" (Kurt Cobain), the film does do a good job of showing the mental state of someone who has clearly given up on life and detached themselves from their surroundings. However, it's not particularly engrossing for the viewer to watch. Michael Pitt inhabits the character beautifully, with his sad eyes, mumbling speech, and defiant laziness. It's just that he never really gets the chance to do much that's interesting, other than wear a woman's nightgown or a pair of spacey sunglasses. The most beautiful scene in the film is when Blake's ghost slips out of his corpse and climbs an invisible ladder into the next life. It gives both the character and the audience an opportunity to escape from his dreary, lonely world.

Bjork's second solo CD is her most eclectic work so far, and even more sonically adventurous than her excellent &quot;Debut&quot;. Diverse as it is, though, the great thing about Bjork is that her music is always unmistakably hers (partially due to her one-of-a-kind voice, but also due to her exuberant strangeness). With the hard-hitting opening track &quot;Army of Me&quot;, Bjork scolds someone for their self-pity and laziness. &quot;Hyper-ballad&quot; and &quot;The Modern Things&quot; are both fanciful and inventive techno-infused tracks. &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; is a charming big band throwback, while the Tricky-produced &quot;Enjoy&quot; and Headphones&quot; are both abrasive, erotic love songs. Overall, this album is a brilliant, experimental smorgasbord.

I'll admit: I've never read the "Hellblazer" comic that "Constantine" is based on. But I was intrigued by the previews, and have enjoyed some other titles of DC Comics' VERTIGO line, so I decided to give this movie a shot.Surprise! I liked it. In fact, it's probably the best supernatural thriller I've seen in a while. (Did anyone else try to sit through "The Order" or "Lost Souls"? Blech!) What I think helped make the film work for me was the dark comedy subtly weaved throughout the film, which kept it from taking itself too seriously. In terms of the special affects and CGI, I thought they worked well; I never felt like they overpowered the film or the actors the way they did in a film like "Van Helsing", so I never felt like I was watching a cartoon instead of a live action film.As for the acting, I think it's time someone took a stand for much-criticized Mr. Reeves. True, he's not a technically superior actor, but he does have a definite charisma, and I think a very good sense of both action and comedy. (I've seen Keanu give good, effective performances in a variety of films, including "Something's Gotta Give", "The Gift", "Parenthood", "Speed", and, of course, the "Matrix" trilogy. So give poor Keanu a break guys! It's not his fault he's so pretty!) Especially when paired with a more cerebral actress like Rachel Weisz, Keanu does just fine.For a popcorn flick, I found this movie to be well-written, well-directed, exciting and fun. Don't be a playa hata!

"Evil Heat" is an impressive follow-up to Primal Scream's excellent 2000 release "XTRMNTR". "XTRMNTR" was a very political album, combining a punk rock sensibility with abrasive techno sounds to rage against consumption, capitalism and conformity. With "Evil Heat", the focus seems to be more on sexuality and spirituality, and the sound, although somewhat similar, is a little leaner, tighter, and more streamlined. Songs like "Miss Lucifer", "The Lord is my Shotgun" and "Some Velvet Morning" are so throbbing and sexual that they wouldn't sound at all out of place in a strip club. "Rise" and "City" are more reminiscent of their previous album, with a more straightforward rock sound and rebellious, political lyrics. The biggest surprises for me are the album's opening and closing tracks, "Deep Hit of Morning Sun" and "Space Blues Number 2". Both are almost gospel-like in their themes of spirituality and unity. Overall, this is a sonically excellent and thematically provocative rock album.

The Stranger is a short novel that is fascinating as a character study. The protagonist is a young man, Meursault, who has a strangely detached, and yet benevolent, way of looking at the world. Mostly, he lives moment to moment, resigned and seemingly unmoved by most of what happens around him (including his mother's death). After a series of unfortunate events, Meursault finds himself on trial for murder, and those responsible for his fate mistake his detachment for evil and callousness. This novel shows how society treats people who are different, and how people are all too quick to label people &quot;evil&quot; that they don't understand.

I just watched "A Clockwork Orange" again for the first time in fourteen years. The last time I watched it I was only 15, so clearly my impression of it at this point in my life is different. Even at 15, I found the violence to be disturbing and not at all funny, and understood on some level that the main characer, Alex, despite his "rehabilitation", still had to pay the price for the vicious crimes he commits in the beginning of the film. At 29, this karmic theme makes even more sense to me. Despite being rendered incapable of violence due to the experimental treatment he receives, Alex still doesn't understand the consequences of his actions, and can't see his crimes from the perspective of his victims. So although the government's "treatment" may keep violent criminals from committing more violent crimes, it does nothing to treat the spiritual illness of a society who still, at it's core, rewards aggressiveness and believes that "might makes right".What I certainly didn't appreciate at 15 were the stunning and provocative visuals of the film. Instead of creating a future full of high-tech gadgets, Kubrick fills the scenary with imagery suggesting mannequin-like sexuality and soulless, tacky modernism. Even Alex's gang uniform (lipstick, false eyelash, jockstrap, combat boots) suggests phony, plastic beauty combined with aggressiveness and insanity.Although I believe that "Clockwork" and "Eyes Wide Shut" are the only Kubrick films I've seen so far, I can see from both of these brilliant films why he's widely considered to be a genius filmmaker.

When this album came out, it was like a musical breath of fresh air. With so many wannabe R&amp;B &quot;divas&quot; using cookie-cutter production and contrived sexuality to sell records, Macy emerged as a uniquely talented artist with something to say. Her hit song &quot;I Try&quot;, along with another track &quot;Still&quot;, display raw vulnerability along with her raspy, one-of-a-kind voice. Tracks like &quot;Caligula&quot; and &quot;Sexomatic&quot; showcase Macy's more sexual side (which Macy chooses to express with a dose of humor and fun, as opposed to just heavy breathing). &quot;I've Committed Murder&quot; is a hilarious revenge fantasy, and songs like &quot;A Moment to Myself&quot; and &quot;I Can't Wait to Meetchu&quot; show a woman exploring her spirituality. Macy's honest and offbeat lyrics, along with Andrew Slater's (who produced Fiona Apple's remarkable debut) stellar, eclectic production combined to create one of the best R&amp;B debuts in years. Rock on, Macy.

I saw this movie 3 times in the theatre, and I've seen it easily 50 times since. It is one of the funniest movies of all time. It's so exploitive, so ridiculous, and so offensive that it's become a cult film the likes of which hasn't been seen since "Rocky Horror". Elizabeth Berkeley (whose acting chops were adequate enough for "Saved by the Bell" but hardly enough to carry a film) plays Nomi, an ex-hooker who moves to Vegas to become a dancer, but has to pay the bills stripping at a seedy bar. After catching the eye of the bisexual lead in a big hotel show called "Goddess" (the smoking hot Gina Gershon, who is the only one whose career was actually helped by this film), Nomi is able to get a more legit (albeit still topless) dancing job. From there, drugs, catfights, violence, and betrayal ensue. Althought the script and most of the acting performances are awful, this movie does have wonderfully gaudy costumes and set designs, and some of the music is pretty good, too (My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, David Bowie, etc.) Hang out with your friends, watch this movie, and laugh your butt off.

*** 1/2After two very strong seasons, "Dexter", the show about your friendly neighborhood serial killer, takes a slight quality dip. Not that it ever becomes poor or even mediocre, really. It's just that, so far with "Dexter", the show's seasons seem to be as good as the main villian, who usually serves as a twisted counterpart for Dexter. In Season 1, the Ice Truck Killer, who turned out to be Dexter's own brother, served this role. He offered Dexter a chance to find brotherhood, familiy, and acceptance, but in the end Dexter chose his "fake" life over a completely chaotic, amoral "real" life with his brother. In the second season, Lyla, a beautiful sociopath, also offered Dexter the chance for real acceptance by a disturbed kindred spirit, and yet he made the same choice in the end - to save the innocents in his life.The third season finds Dexter looking for a truthful connection with not a brother or a lover, but a friend. Miguel Prado, played by Jimmy Smitts, is a powerful, respected DA. Like with Lyla, the two have an instant attraction, probably because they can each see the other for who they really are - a damaged and disturbed vigilante. Unfortunately, the storyline is slow to really catch on, and for a while, the season seems to drag. It's only at the end of the season, when Miguel and Dexter engage in a killer's game of chess, that the storyline gains momentum. It doesn't help that the subplots aren't particularly interesting either: Deborah's relationship with a musician, Dexter's impending wedding and fatherhood, or Batista's affair with a vice cop are all storylines that don't offer a lot of interest.Fans should take heart, though ... Season 4, so far only two episodes from its finale, is right back on track. John Lithgow's Trinity Killer may be the show's best villian/counterpart so far.

I saw "The Rules of Attraction" shortly after reading the novel, and found it to be a pretty faithful and entertaining adaption. The movie stays true to the tone of the book, even if it did change the time period from the early 80's to present day. All the visual and stylistic tricks the filmmakers used worked to convey the confusion, drug use, and craziness that the troubled students of Camden college are experiencing. Since the film didn't shy away from many of the dark themes of the book, my only real complaint was how much the film minimized the homosexual relationship between Sean and Paul in the film (which was much more explicit and extensive in the book). It seems that in this day and age, drug use, suicide, and violence are all acceptable film content, but for a mainstream film, male on male sex is still too much of a taboo.

Nelly Furtado seems to have a penchant for completely switching gears with each album. Nelly's last album, "Folklore", was an organic, mature, mostly world music and acoustic album. Her new album, "Loose", is a much more r&b-and-pop-oriented endeavor. And yet, despite the slick pop sheen added to her songs, she hasn't lost any of the latin influence, introspective lyrics or emotional delivery that made her less commercial music so lovely. For every fun, sexy, booty-shaking track ("Promiscuous", "ManEater", "Do It") there's another about spiritual growth ("Afraid", "Te Busque")or somber reflection ("All Good Things Come to and End", "In God's Hands"). I've said it before and I'll say it again: There's nothing wrong with pop music if it's creative, well-written and well-produced. "Loose" is probably the best pop album I've heard in a while. Well done, Ms Furtado.

This complex and somewhat difficult film explores depression and self-destructiveness by weaving together the stories of three women. In the 1920's, Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf, who, plagued by mental illness yet blessed with a nurturing, devoted husband, begins writing her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;. In the late 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a housewife who is at the same time reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and contemplating suicide. In present day, Meryl Streep plays a New York book editor who is caring for her sick and increasingly spiteful friend and former lover. The film deals with an incredible array of difficult issues. Almost all of the characters in the film display some kind of same-sex attraction, which many of them don't seem to know how to deal with (at one point Virginia shares a long and inappropriate kiss with her sister). And all three of the main characters are living on the edge of sanity, desperately trying to cope both with their roles as mothers and caretakers and with their own demons and unfulfilled desires. Although this is at times a very difficult film to watch, it's mostly because the pain and anguish of the characters is just so real, mosty due to the excellent performances by everyone in the film. And while the connection between the women seems initially to be nothing more than &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, toward the end of the film two of the main characters' stories come together in an unexpected and heartbreaking way. Overall, it's a devastating, yet cathartic, film.

Six Feet Under is, in my opinion, the best show on television. It is probably my favorite television show of all time. Unfortunately, it has ruined me for most network television. The writing is superb. The show is always unpredictable and captivating, and yet nothing that happens ever just feels like a stunt. It is beautifully acted by the entire cast. Instead of stock characters, the people who inhabit this world appear as three dimensional, flawed, tragic, comic, and beautiful human beings. Instead of being a "show about nothing", the trend started by Seinfeld that pretty much every show since seems to be imitating, Six Feet Under is the opposite: it's a show about everything. Life, death, love, God, religion, family, sexuality, tragedy, comedy ... it's all covered. I know I'm gushing, but when you've been fed a steady diet of [garbage] for so long and something gourmet comes along ... it's hard not to. When this show ends I will be deeply saddened.

Aileen Wuornos is a fascinating woman, and her interviews are by far the most mesmerizing part of this documentary film. At times charming, confrontational, remorseful and frightening, Aileen constantly contradicts herself, at times repenting for her crimes and showing sympathy for her victim's families, and at other times maintaining her position as a victim of circumstance and society. So whereas the "Monster" film showed a clearer, more linear narrative of Aileen's life, this documentary leaves the viewer with far more questions than answers. A few of which are "Was Aileen really horrifically abused by her father?" "Did Aileen's first victim really rape and torture her?" "Does Aileen really want to be die?" The only question that seems to have a clear answer after watching this film is this one: "Is Aileen really insane?" The answer is clearly "yes".

I was recommended this book by a good friend of mine. I found the book to be very well-written. I also found the main character, Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom, to be one of the most unappealing, pathetic and annoying characters in fiction. Rabbit is a formerly celebrated high school athlete who, at 26, has settled into a mundane life as a salesman, husband, and soon-to-be father (his wife is pregnant). Apparently having a quarter-life crisis, he leaves his wife, takes up with a prostitute, starts hanging out with a local minister and takes a job as a gardener. Harry appears to be the kind of person who, due to his good looks and charm, is somehow always able to avoid having to take responsibility for his actions. He is constantly being given second (and third, and fourth) chances by everyone in his life, despite his appalling behavior. He is selfish, aimless and spoiled. I'm sure the author intended that the character provoke this reaction, and intended it as a criticism of suburban American society at the time it was written. But because I found Rabbit to be such an unappetizing character, I have no desire to read any of the sequels to this book.

I like Marilyn Manson. I think he's a smart guy with interesting things to say. And I think there's a lot of irony and comedy in what he does that reactionary people tend to miss. I also think some of his music has actually been quite good, especially his "Mechanical Animals" album.So what of his latest offering, "The Golden Age of Grotesque"? I think it's decent. There's a handful of standout tracks: the inventive, vintage-Berlin-inspired title track, the anarchic anthem "This is the New Sh*t", the derivative, yet still affective, "mOBSCENE". Unfortunately, most of the songs on "Grotesque" are just more of the same Manson we've been hearing for years: nihilism, rage, sarcasm, melodrama. At one point his schtick was new and exciting, but it just doesn't seem to have the same twisted charm anymore that it used to. To some extent it almost seems ... mundane.I think Manson has the talent to take his music and persona in a new, interesting direction. Unfortunately, if he doesn't, I think he's quickly on the way to becoming irrelevent.

I enjoy reading literature, and am rarely disappointed when I read a book that has been labeled a classic. "Naked Lunch" is an exception. I had to force myself to finish this book, because it just did not really hold my interest at all. Although I could appreciate the dark, twisted, imaginative imagery, there was just no real story to speak of. There were hints of satire here and there, but then the prose would just descend into an incoherent mess. I can only recommend this book as a cautionary tale about the nightmarish, horrifying, delusional state that being a heroin junkie must put you in.For a more clear and coherent surreal pornographic nightmare, I'd recommend "Story of the Eye" ...

I liked the first "Charlie's Angels" film. All three lead actresses were charming and had great chemistry together, the action scenes were surprisingly exciting and it didn't take itself too seriously. It was just fun. The sequel, "Full Throttle", however, is a letdown. Although Cameron, Drew and Lucy are still sexy and adorable, the script is awful. It's just an incoherent mess. Almost all of the jokes fall flat, and this time the action sequences are poorly conceived and executed. The only thing I really found interesting about the film was the casting of Demi Moore as "fallen angel" Madison Lee. Moore is diabolically sexy in the role, so it's too bad the script doesn't give her enough to do. With four of the most exciting actresses in Hollywood in one film, it's really a shame the writers and director couldn't make this film work.

"Wanderlust" functions less as a film than it does as a series of comedy sketches stitched together. Starring two attractive and funny leads (Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston) and featuring even more likable and funny actors in supporting roles (Justin Theroux, Lauren Ambrose, Malin Akerman, Alan Alda, etc.); there is no shortage of talent here to mine. What's lacking is a consistent, cohesive storyline and believable character development.Comedy Sketch 1: The film starts with couple George (Rudd) and Linda (Aniston) in New York, where their lives are falling apart. They've just spent a fortune on a tiny, overpriced studio apartment (or "microloft" as the real estate agent insists on calling it) when George loses his job, while Linda is unable to pitch her documentary (a labor of love about penguin testicular cancer) to HBO. This section of the film plays like a perfunctory parody of New York life, where hurried, exhausted people work in demanding, soul-crushing jobs just to be able to afford tiny apartments. This is territory that has been explored many, many times in much more clever films.Comedy Sketch 2: Desperate, George and Linda pack up and move to Atlanta, where George can work for his brother. Driving through northern Georgia and looking for a place to spend the night, the couple happens upon the "Elysium" community, a hippie commune full of all sorts of wacky, countercultural characters. George and Linda have a blast spending the night partying with the welcoming and free-spirited people, before continuing onto Atlanta.Comedy Sketch 3: George and Linda arrive at George's obnoxious, tactless brother's garish McMansion, in order to work for his Port-a-Potty business. The whole place reeks of misery, with George a rage-aholic, his wife heavily medicated, and his son an awful brat. So George and Linda quickly decide to go back to Comedy Sketch 2, to try living full time in Elysium.The film might have worked if it had just completely abandoned any conventional storytelling and just embraced being completely absurd (like "Wet Hot American Summer", the classic that director David Wain wrote). Unfortunately, "Wanderlust" tries to convince the audience that its main characters have somehow learned something throughout all their wacky adventures, and emerged a stronger couple, and its in this way that the film falls flat. George and Linda seem to just flail about the film, going from one phony epiphany to another, before finally falling into a flat, contrived "happy ending."

This is the sixth novel I've read by Mr. Vonnegut, although it's the first of his that I've read in several years. Reading this book was sort of like becoming re-acquainted with an old friend. Although I had remembered how inventive, creative and simultaneously sweet and cynical Vonnegut's books were, I had forgotten how much fun they were to read. Similar themes tend to pop up in Vonnegut's novels: the twisted ridiculousness of war, religion and human nature being the most persistent. However, at his best he seems to rise above cynicism and actually offer somewhat optimistic insight into the human condition, although it's often so concealed in humor and fantasy that you might not even realize that you've been hit with something profound. In "Slaughterhouse-Five", the aliens who kidnap Billy Pilgrim can see all of time as clearly as we can see the horizon. Since the future is so clear and fixed to them, they advise Billy simply to "look at the things you like and don't look at the things you don't." For an American Science Fiction writer, it's a curiously Eastern way of thinking.

It occured to me recently that the only artist I can think of that Bjork can really be compared to is Picasso. Like Picasso, she is an utterly original, intuitive, groundbreaking, prolific and versatile genius who also happens to be shrewd enough and ambitious enough to have become world-famous.With "Medula", Bjork continues to follow her own instincts, creating more unpredictable, otherworldly, profound, beautiful and inspiring music the likes of which the world has never heard before.Here's hoping that Bjork, like Picasso, continues making masterpieces until she's 90-something years old ...

Although I loved her voice on Zero 7's tracks, my first introduction to Sia's solo music was (like many other people) hearing the gorgeous, epic "Breathe Me" on the finale of Six Feet Under. Since then, I've listened to both of Sia's solo albums, and what really impresses me is the growth she's already shown. "Healing Is Difficult" was a pop/electronica album, accented by crisp, jazz-influenced vocals. The result was a sort of Lamb meets Esthero sound that worked okay, but didn't blow me away. "Colour the Small One" is a complete departure ... the sound is mellower, more organic and more mature. The songs are more contemplative and less obvious, and they give Sia's alluring alto room to breath and shine. I'm looking forward to hearing Sia's next effort.

I was deeply saddened by the news of Elliot Smith's suicide yesterday.A friend gave me &quot;XO&quot; for Christmas five years ago, and I fell in love with Elliot's music. I was listening to this CD the day before I found out he died. This is a beautiful and emotional album that speaks to all the highs and lows of human experience. I tended to gravitate towards the saddest songs on this CD for some reason ... maybe because they're just so intimate and real. &quot;Waltz #2&quot; is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard, because instead of being about a doomed love affair, it's actually about Elliot watching his mother wither after marrying the wrong man. &quot;Pitseleh&quot;, &quot;Oh Well, Okay&quot; and &quot;I Didn't Understand&quot; are all heartbreakingly beautiful, aching songs as well.We lost a truly great talent. RIP Elliot.

I just read the Bell Jar, and I was shocked at how much I could relate to the main character. Esther is 19 years old, and at that age I was feeling and experiencing so many of the same things. The time was different, the specifics were different, and our genders are different, and yet this book hit so close to home that it was uncomfortable, and yet cathartic, to read it. This book perfectly depicts the feeling of being a very young adult in our society, and looking at the world around you and seeing absolutely nothing that appeals to you. It depicts the confusion, pain, isolation, and even insanity that can be the result. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to young people who are struggling to find their footing in a society that can be cold, frightening, and overwhelming.

We knew photogenic young Justin (the unofficial lead singer of the world's most successful boy band) could dance and carry a tune. But who knew that his solo CD would be one of the best pop albums in recent years? In &quot;Justified&quot;, Justin takes a slight detour from the totally sugary music of N Sync and ventures into a more mature R&amp;B sound. The result is surprisingly affective. My favorite tracks are the ones produced by Timbaland (&quot;Cry me a River&quot;, &quot;(And She Said) Take Me Now&quot;). There's something about the unique textures he dresses Justin's unthreatening sexuality in that comes across as really fresh. The ubiquitous Neptunes do a good job with &quot;Senorita&quot; and &quot;Like I Love You&quot;. The only disappointing tracks on the album for me are the two weepy ballads. But for the most part, this is a fun, tight, and very enjoyable pop album.

Like many of Fiona's fans, I've been listening to most of the songs on "Extraordinary Machine" for months; that is, the Jon Brion-produced versions that leaked and spread like wildfire over the internet earlier this year. And yet despite already having access to these songs, I was still breathlessly anticipating the official release of the album. Knowing that the majority of the songs had been reworked by a producer known for working with hip-hop artists, I couldn't wait to find out what the songs sounded like now.After finally hearing the official release of "Extraordinary Machine" I've come to an unexpected conclusion ... that the production isn't really all that important. Most people seem to have a firm opinion on which version they like better. For me, my opinion is mixed ... I prefer the fiestier demo version of "Red, red, red" to the more subdued final version, and I also prefer Fiona's raw, ragged vocals on the demo version of "Oh, Well". And yet on the other hand, I love the crisp percussion added to "Tymps".The truth is, it's Fiona's songs that really matter, not how they're dressed, and the songs themselves have barely changed. Fiona's literate, confessional lyrics, playful melodies and smoky vocals shine either way. It's her "extraordinary" talent that the music world has been missing. The "machines" used to package it are secondary.Welcome back, Fiona. We missed ya, babe.

In the film "Freeway", Reese Witherspoon reinvented the fairy tale character of Little Red Riding Hood as a scrappy survivor capable of rescuing herself from the Big Bad Wolf. In "Hard Candy", Ellen Page goes even further, and plays Little Red Riding Hood as a ruthless vigilante on a mission to punish the Big Bad Wolf for his sins."Hard Candy" is a taut, intelligent, intense thriller that completely ignores the normal clich&eacute;s of victims, predators, villains and vigilantes. Even more impressive is that the entire film is carried by the two superb performances of Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page. Wilson's Jeff is evil and manipulative to be sure, but he also fills the character with plenty of vulnerability, self-loathing and desperation. Page's Hayley is a true revelation: powerful, brilliant and fearless. By the end of the film you're not sure whether she's an avenging angel or a psychopath ... and since the film doesn't ever provide the viewer with any more justification for her actions than Hayley provides Jeff, you're left to draw your own conclusions. I love that!

I'll admit - I was slightly disappointed by this CD. After &quot;Movement in Still Life&quot; - which I thought was an incredibly inventive, playful and adventurous sonic trip, this CD seemed a little tame. I should have known by the album's cover art, with BT dressed up like Sean &quot;P. Diddy&quot; Combs, that this album was going to be a much more commercial endeavor. However, I still enjoy this album, despite its more pop sensibility. At its best it's sparkly, futuristic, and fun. &quot;Somnambulist&quot; is easily the best dance record I've heard in years. &quot;Knowledge of Self&quot; continues BT's experiments with hip hop that he began on &quot;Movement&quot; ... and it sounds kick-ass. &quot;Superfabulous&quot;, although a little silly, still manages to intrigue me ... Rose McGowan is not a strong singer, but there's something seductive and tongue-in-cheek about her vocals. And &quot;Force of Gravity&quot;, featuring 'N sync's JC Chasez, is an effective pop-trance breakup lament.

I was new to Primal Scream when I first heard this album, so I don't know much about their previous work or history. All I can say is that this album blew me away. Musically, it's an amazing combination of aggressive punk guitars and abrasive techno beats. Lyrically, the songs rage against capitalism, conformity, greed, and rampant consumerism. "Kill All Hippies" defiantly hisses "You've got the money ... I've got the soul." "Insect Royalty" suggests the media brainwashing most modern people are a victim of. The question-authority anthem "Swastika Eyes" comes in two versions: the more guitar-led original version, and an amazingly tripped out Chemical Brothers remix. What I get out of this album is more than just an adolescent rage against authority. I think the underlying message of all this is a positive one ... be true to yourself.

I received this beautiful book as a Christmas gift, and it was a wonderful surprise. I've been doing yoga for about a year and a half, and I think this book will be a very helpful and handy resource. It contains a brief history of yoga, descriptions of the various types of yoga, an illustrated guide to all of the most common poses, advice for students and aspiring students, advice on diet, advice on sequencing poses and lists of additional resources. To top it off, this is a beautifully designed book with very attractive photography. This book would be a fine gift or investment for any yoga student.

Before the Wachowski brothers became cultural icons with their "Matrix" films, they directed this stylish film noir about two girls who fall in love and try to steal two million dollars from the Mob. Visually, the film is full of all sorts of cool camera tricks and visuals, which hint at the incredible affects they would later utilize in the Matrix trilogy. It should also be noted that the intruiging and effective mob plotline came before HBO's groundbreaking "Sopranos" series. So this movie was ahead of its time in many ways. But the best thing about this film has to be the chemistry between Corky (Gina Gershon), a tomboyish ex-con, and Violet (Jennifer Tilly), a mobster's closeted girlfriend. They generate more romantic and sexual heat than the vast majority of heterosexual Hollywood matches.

The revenge film is a genre that is heavily populated, and yet few of its members ever really transcend to greatness. For every great revenge film ("Last House on the Left", "Kill Bill") there are at least ten that are silly, schlocky, or exploitive."The Horseman" doesn't aim to reinvent the revenge film drama, but elevate it. The very simple plot involves a father's quest to punish the men involved with a porn shoot that his troubled daughter was involved in, which either directly or indirectly led to her death. The father (Christian) visits each member of the seedy network of porn purveyors, ruthlessly determined to use any means necessary (violence, torture, threats) to find out who was directly involved, and punish them.Peter Marshall gives a tour-de-force performance as Christian (the father) that makes the film succeed. When confronting the men who he believes were responsible for his daughter's death, he is merciless, mechanical, and unapologetically violent. But the actor's eyes reveal the character's truth - that Christian is a man in so much pain, that numbness and violence are his only choices. It's clear that Christian's anger, hatred, and thirst for vengeance are also his punishment to himself for failing his daughter as a father and protector. Underneath the gritty violence, Marshall shows the character's broken heart.Although the bloody, ugly, violent business of revenge make up most of the film, a subplot where Christian befriends a troubled runaway add to Christian's humanity. And when his plot for revenge endangers the girl in the film's final act, it gives Christian's violent quest an urgency and opportunity for redemption.Bravo.

I see this film as a love story, and probably one of the most complicated, realistic and poignant ones I've seen in a while. Instead of two characters who meet, fall in love, and live happily ever after, Kitty and Walter take a much more difficult journey.Aging playgirl Kitty (Naomi Watts) and nerdy doctor Walter (Edward Norton) marry for all the wrong reasons. Walter's feelings for Kitty are based more on infatuation then on genuine love and respect, and Kitty simply seems to see Walter as a way to escape her family and avoid becoming a spinster. After Kitty has an affair, Walter makes an ultimatum that destroy's Kitty's relationship with her lover, and sends them both to rural China on a mission that is likely to cause one or both of them to die of cholera. The two characters are both so hopelessly disillusioned and depressed at that point that neither seems to care.Strangely, what is meant to be a bitter ending transforms into a hopeful beginning. Isolated and living in miserable conditions, Kitty and Walter are somehow able to find a sense of purpose and a true appreciation for one another. It's as if the characters first have to despise one another for who they are not before they can love each other for who they are."The Painted Veil" is a literate, sophisticated love story for adults, that features beautiful cinematography and wonderful performances by two of the best lead actors in film today.

Once upon a time, Janet Jackson was one of my favorite pop stars. Although she was never a strong singer, you could always count on Janet to deliver fresh grooves, fresh dance moves and fresh visuals. Unfortunately "Damita Jo," her latest offering, doesn't seem to offer anything new. When Ms. Jackson released her "Janet" album a decade ago, the sexually charged posturings seemed sincere, especially since Janet had already established herself as a pop star who didn't have to exploit herself to be successful. But now, three albums later, all the overt carnal come-ons seem kind of tired. Janet is now approaching 40, and probably has much more on her mind than her next orgasm.There are several good tracks on "Damita Jo", particularly the ones were Janet pursues an old-skool vibe, like with the song "I Want You" or "R&B; Junkie". These two tracks make me wish Janet had just made a classic R&B; album, instead of trying to compete with teenage nymphets half her age. Because aside from a handful of gems, most of "Damita Jo" CD consists of bland, breathy ballads and contrived sexuality.

Although I wouldn't call this film "realistic" per se, what it does is evoke the complicated and messy nature of emotions and relationships. And it does so by touching on the most absolutely messy and complicated issues in life: family, romance, death, class, revenge, and sex.With an intense script and a group of absolutely powerhouse actors at his disposal, the director wisely keeps the direction elegant and subtle. By never falling into triteness or heavy-handedness, he let's the actors do what they all do best: create living, breathing, devastating, tragic, and human characters that the audience can relate to.

Although this album isn't really a departure for Ms. Gray, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. TTWBM is just as exuberant, funky, and soulful as her previous two albums, and she's tinkered with the sound only slightly. Musically, it seems to have more spacey electronic sounds thrown in to spice up the more traditional R&B production. Lyrically, she's on pretty familiar territory, exploring her spirituality and sexuality with a healthy dose of humor. "When I See You" is an funky ode to fighting just to make up, "Come Together" explores our society's attempts at unity after tragic recent events, "My Fondest Childhood Memories" is Macy's THIRD song about a murder fantasy, and "Screamin'" is about finding relief in sexual ecstacy. How can you resist someone so original, talented and adorable?

This is my favorite novel by one of my favorite writers. Anyone who has ever read anything by Charles Bukowski knows that he pulls no punches, spilling his guts about his gin-soaked, skid-row life with brutal honesty, humor, and vulgar wit. In Ham on Rye, however, he reveals much more than his adult misadventures. He describes in devastating detail his childhood and adolescence, and after reading it, it is painfully obvious why he would feel the need to spend so much of his life numbing himself with alcohol. This novel truly reveals the pain, sensitivity, hurt and need hiding beneath the macho, crass exterior so many of his readers fell in love with. If he were still alive, I'd be tempted to track him down just to give him a hug.

Thank God for Nicole Kidman. She's at the top of the Hollywood food chain; a statuesque beauty with an Academy Award, and yet she still continues to make intelligent, though-provoking, risky films for an adult audience."Birth" is an enigmatic little film. It could probably be described as a supernatural thriller, but if it is it's a very subtle, quiet, and low-key one. When widowed Anna is finally ready to remarry and move on ten years after her husband's death, a preternaturally composed 10-year-old boy literally walks into her life claiming to be her reincarnated late husband back to claim her as his own. Although this premise may seem ridiculous, the script, director and actors all seem to make everything that happens effortlessly believable. The obvious question is whether or not the boy is really Anna's late husband, but the film also poses less obvious, possibly rhetorical questions to its audience about love, death and grief.

With "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater", Vonnegut takes on the sordid issue of class. The main character, Eliot Rosewater, has inherited vast wealth, but feels lost and adrift until he moves to a small town and spends all his time giving "uncritical love" and money to the depressed, disenfranchised locals. His behavior completely mortifies his elitist Senator Father and psychologically troubled princess wife. It also allows a greedy young lawyer ammunition to have him declared insane; the only way possible to get his hands on part of his fortune.If recent studies have shown that rich people are no more intelligent (at least in terms of IQ) than poor people, this is something that Vonnegut clearly knew decades ago. It's clear from this novel that he believed that the "haves" and "have-nots" were usually separated by little more than luck; usually involving being born into the right circumstances. Eliot's father subscribes to the conventional American wisdom that hard work is all it takes to succeed. Eliot's idol, Science Fiction writer Kilgore Trout, has a more ambivalent point of view. The reader is left to make their own conclusion.

He may be an expatriate boy-bander, but Robbie Williams shares much more in common with pop vocalists like Elton John and George Michael than he does with, say, Justin Timberlake. For the most part, Robbie's music is well-crafted, tuneful and catchy, the songs made more for the long haul than they are eager to jump on every pop music trend. Robbie's persona is always cheeky and ironic, and yet if you pay close attention to the lyrics of most of his songs, they're full of yearnings for love, peace and self-acceptance. That's what makes Robbie Williams interesting and enigmatic: this combination of the rabble-rousing bad boy and the sensitive, poetic soul. Overall, this is a very worthwhile collection for any pop music fan.

I love Pink. She's feisty, fun, sincere, and a risk taker. She's got a great voice, and she's smart enough to find talented collaborators who share her musical vision.On "Try This", Pink ventures even further into bona fide rock chick territory than she did on "Missundazstood", enlisting Rancid's Tim Armstrong to write and produce a big chunk of her album. However, Pink refuses to have to choose between her diverse influences, so there're still sprinkles of R&B;, blues and punk throughout the CD. "Trouble" and "Try Too Hard" are catchy, straightforward rock songs. "Oh My God", featuring vocals from indie rapper Peaches, crackles with sincere sexuality. "Waiting For Love" finds Pink wailing longingly like Janis Joplin (surprisingly effectively). In "Humble Neighborhoods", a punk anthem, Pink touts the musical superiority of the underprivileged. Strangely, one of the best songs on the album is "Hooker", which is hidden after the last track. In it, Pink sounds downright hardcore as she sneers "You ain't nothing but a hooker ... selling your f$&%ing soul." I wonder if she's talking about anyone we know?

Jem may share the name of an 80's animated character, but she is no cartoon. Singer/songwriter Jem Griffiths appears to be a bona fide musical talent. I can see why it's easy for people to compare her to other female artists: her voice is similar in timbre to Beth Orton's and her music does have some of the slinkiness and soothingness of Dido's. But there's also definitely something unique going on here, not just an imitation or merging of other musician's styles. Jem combines inventive beats with deceptively straightforward lyrics to create music that both challenges you and seduces you at the same time. Jem has the potential to evolve into a great artist.

Since Season 3 of True Blood ended, I've gone back and watched the first season, and compared to the feverish pace that the show now employs, the first season seems downright slow by comparison. The show, like a formerly morally conflicted baby vampire, seems to have now completely embraced its true nature: that of a wild, crazy, sexy, scary, violent soap opera (albeit an intelligent, well-written and well-acted one).Although the werewolves (as well as were-panthers) make their debut this season, more than anything Season 3 belongs to the crazy vampires. Dennis O'Hare practically hijacks the show, chewing up the scenery as power-hungry Russell Edgington, Vampire King of Mississippi. He also gets the best scene of the season, and possibly the best scene of the series, when he murders a TV reporter on live TV, then lectures American about its narcissism and greed before proclaiming "we will eat you ... after we eat your children." It's darkly hilarious, insightful, and scary all at once. Russell truly goes mad after his lover, Talbot, is killed, which is a shame, really, because Talbot was also a hilarious and over-the-top character; a vain, pretentious male vampire housewife. James Frain, an actor I last saw playing King Henry's secretary on the Tudors, also does a hilarious turn playing Franklyn, an obsessive vampire who turns his co-dependent, stalker-ish sense of romance on Tara.Another highlight of the season is Lafayette's reunion with his schizophrenic Mom (played by the formidable Alfre Woodard) and his romance with his mother's nurse, Jesus, who turns out to be a witch. Lafayette and Jesus are probably one of the show's most interesting couples, along with baby vampire Jessica and her mama's boy love interest Hoyt. The show's central pairing, Sookie and Bill, don't fare well at all this season, and as nasty and naughty as he is, by the end of the season you find yourself rooting more for Sookie to finally succumb to Eric's roguish charms, instead of her returning to Bill, who continues to reveal himself to be more duplicitous and weasely than he tries to appear to be.Some of the other storylines don't fare as well, and they tend to be the ones that involve white trash. Sam's subplot with his birth parents went nowhere, and I didn't find a lot interesting about Jason's love affair with Crystal, whose backwoods, meth-dealing family in nearby Hotshot Jason accurately describes as a "hillbilly freak show".However, even when the show missteps, it never fails to be entertaining. After three seasons, True Blood is still my favorite current TV show, and when the new episodes are airing it's enough to make Sunday Nights something to look forward to."I don't know who you think you are, but I know this much is true ... I wanna do bad things with you."

After the disappointing "Secret Window" and the preposterous "Identity", I was wary that "The Machinist" was going to be another lame "Oh, it's all in his head" psychological thriller. Luckily, I didn't find that to be the case. "The Machinist" expertly portrays a character that, due to a year without sleep, lives in a world somewhere in between reality and la-la land. He's not so much insane as he is half asleep, and so he's constantly being bombarded with surreal symbols, clues and characters that are trying to push him towards coming to terms with what's causing his self-imposed sleep (and food) deprivation.Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale's weight loss for the role, and for good reason: he looks shockingly emaciated. Aside from his physical transformation, his performance is also pitch perfect. It's also interesting seeing Bale act alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh, who's made a career of doing excellent, chameleon-like work in mostly small films, a path that Bale seems to be following as well. She is also excellent, although it's the kind of role she's played often before and is really kind of wasted in.Is "The Machinist" the kind of film masterpiece that it would be worth risking your health and starving yourself for? No. But it is an intelligent, moody, creepy and effective film.

Since I am only the second person to review this film, it's clear that it's not very well known. I had never heard of it when I stumbled upon it, and, while watching it, was surprised by a number of things: first and foremost, how good it is, how unpredictable the story is, and also how horribly grim it ends up being.The film first introduces the audience to Erica, a promiscuous, damaged woman with seemingly no social connections. She is seen engaging in random sexual encounters, rebuffing any kind of real warmth and affection, until she takes a job at a hardware store and tentatively starts a friendship with fellow employee and veteran Nate. This part of the film is really rather sweet, and it seems like it's going to be the kind of story where two damaged people are redeemed by love.The film then shifts its focus to one of the characters first introduced in the beginning of the film, when Erica was "partying" with several members of a local rock band. Franki, the lead singer, is trying to balance both his band's early success with his mother's cancer and having to work dead end jobs. Unfortunately, during this section of the film, Franki's life takes a huge turn for the worse when both his health and that of his mother's are severely threatened, and the character's meltdown leads to a series of tragic events. Franki's storyline is then tied back to that of Erica and Nate, and it's clear that, instead of a series of vignettes about characters who only meet peripherally, there is really just one story at play here.To give much more away would be a crime, because one of the best things about the film is that it offers constant surprises. I will say that, despite (or maybe even because of) moments of tenderness and genuine human interaction, the film ends up a grim, grisly affair, albeit one that is well acted, written, and directed enough to make it worth a watch if you've got the stomach for such things. Fans of films like "No Country for Old Men" should check this one out.

Although Eddie Murphy is the star of &quot;Boomerang&quot;, it's the ladies in the film who steal the show. Eddie plays Marcus, a smooth cosmetic company ad exec who is used to loving and leaving the ladies he dates. But when he meets Jaqueline (Robin Givens), who treats him as disposably as he usually treats women, the tables are turned. Givens is great playing a ballbusting ice queen, and Halle Berry is sweet and endearing as the platonic friend who Eddie eventually falls for. Grace Jones is absolutely hysterical as a crazed celebrity hired to promote a new perfume, and Eartha Kitt is also funny as the aging cosmetic company's founder. Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, and David Alan Grier all also have supporting roles, but they all play second fiddle to the army of divas in this film.

"The Devil Wears Prada" is an example of how the right talent can help elevate somewhat trite material into an enjoyable and decent film. The script itself is really a very straightforward "fish out of water" story of a young aspiring journalist named Andi who takes a job at a high fashion magazine called "Runway". In order to survive and adapt, she has to learn to accommodate her ruthless boss, Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, and an environment full of snotty fashionistas. And, of course, along the way she learns important lessons about what she wants out of life.Meryl Streep, arguably the greatest film actress ever, chews up the scenery as vicious, powerful, unapologetic Miranda. One scene, in which Miranda is able to destroy a designer's spirits simply by curling her lip subtly at the sight of one of his dresses, is especially telling. However, a lot of credit also belongs to Anne Hathaway. There are few young actresses who could act alongside Meryl Streep without being blown off the screen, but she not only stands her ground but delivers a subtle, charming, comic performance as a smart, yet naive, everygirl facing her first taste of the grownup world. Streep and Hathaway save the film from mediocrity and help make it a charming, lightweight comedy.

****1/2I am late getting on the "Bourne" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received.What we have here is an intelligent, engrossing, well-written, well-acted and well-directed action film that can be enjoyed by families and mainstream audiences, but that doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence. I have to give props ... pulling that off is not easy to do.In the second film of the series, "The Bourne Supremacy", Jason Bourne finds that, despite the fact that he still can't recall most of it, he cannot escape his past. Although managing for two years to live in seclusion with his girlfriend, he is drawn back into the violent world he tried to escape when he is hunted down by another "Treadstone" agent, who fails to murder Bourne but kills his girlfriend. (The underwater scene where Jason watches Marie's lifeless body float away is tender and beautifully sad). Bourne is then framed by the same corrupt CIA agent (Brian Cox) who used to run the "Treadstone" program that created Bourne, and Jason is forced to prove his innocence while still trying to figure out his past.Matt Damon is the thinking man's action hero, and a complete departure from the stereotypically cocky, wisecracking American hero type. In action, Bourne is precise, powerful and unstoppable, but when he's not, Damon plays him with the stoic vulnerability of a man who wants desperately to escape the violent past he can barely remember. When Bourne tracks down the offspring of a politician he assassinated in his former life, the scene is heartbreakingly restrained. Bravo.

"The Human Centipede" could easily have been a schlocky piece of horror trash, but the writer/director team (husband/wife I think?) manage to create something smart and original out of familiar horror elements.In the beginning of the film, the audience is treated to a barrage of very familiar horror movie cliches ... two pretty young girls going out to party, alone in a foreign country, their car breaks down, and, looking for help, end up knocking on the door of (who else?) a mad scientist.And so the horror (and fun) begins. Part of the credit for the film's success goes to Dieter Laser, for playing his sadistic surgeon character as understatedly deranged, which makes him much scarier than if the actor had gone for scenary-chewing histrionics. His character is less motivated by delusions of grandeur than he is just a sadistic overgrown child acting out a bizarre experiment: turning our two heroines, along with another kidnapped Asian tourist, into the titular human centipede.Is the film critiquing modern society's obsession with body modification? Or the scientific community's morals in regards to experimentation? Or recent horror cinema's "torture porn" trend? Possibly. But more than anything, I think the filmmakers created an outrageous concept and challenged themselves to suspend the audience's disbelief enough to make the whole thing seem believable. They succeeded, and it sure is sick, twisted, and kind of fun.

I read a review that referred to "Closer" as "Neil Labute lite." I don't think this comparison is fair at all. Labute's ("In The Company of Men", "Your Friends and Neighbors") films are populated by sadists, sociopaths, and disconnected doormats. The characteres in "Closer", although far from admirable, are, for the most part, fairly ordinary and easy to relate to. Which, in my opinion, makes their behavior all the more captivating and unsettling.The film begins when obituary writer Dan (Jude Law) meets and falls for stripper Alice (Natalie Portman). What starts out as a tender romance gets complicated when Dan gets his picture taken for his novel (ironally based on Alice's life) and feels an instant attraction to photographer Anna (Julia Roberts). Although attracted, Anna resists his advances at first, and ends up involved with dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen), who Dan inadvertantly introduces Anna to. However, after a while, Anna gives into her feelings for Dan, and the result is that the four characters end up in a subtle yet dirty power struggle to preserve their relationships and pride.Filled with scathing, sharp dialogue, and intense, difficult emotional exchanges, "Closer" explores the mix of tenderness, attraction, jealousy, power, competition and need that make up modern romantic and sexual relationships. Mike Nichols' direction is seamless, letting his four talented (and beautiful) leads flesh out their characters wonderfully. Natalie Portman is particularly excellent (her strip-club powerplay scene with Clive Owen is my favorite scene in the film) avoiding all the cliches and creating a character who is both innocent and jaded, manipulative and naive. "Closer" may be my favorite film of the year. Bravo.

I'll admit that I don't really know much about Edie Sedgwick, so I can't speak to the historical accuracy of "Factory Girl". As a dramatic film, I enjoyed it. I thought Sienna Miller's performance was excellent. In fact, "Factory Girl" and "Interview" have both, in my opinion, proved her to be a formidable screen presence. Miller creates a complex character who is both damaged and innocent, and whose natural charisma brings her plenty of attention but is unable to bring her the love and security she desperately needs.The film, which covers Edie's life from the time she left art school in London to her early death at 28, revolves almost entirely around her relationships with the men in her life. Starting with her horrific, abusive father, all of the men in her life, whether straight or gay, friend or lover, use her to advance their own agendas and then discard her when she's no longer useful. The centerpiece of the film is her relationship with Andy Warhol, which is complex and also seems to mirror her various other traumas ... Warhol represents a combination of the benevolent father figure Edie never had, the gay brother Edie lost to suicide, and her own creative and artistic ambitions.Edie seems to love Warhol like a puppy loves his owner. Warhol's feelings for Edie are much more complicated. Although he seems to have real affection towards her, he is clearly also drawn to her for completely superficial reasons: her wealth, her looks, and her willingness to let him use her however he wants in his creatives projects. The relationship sours when Edie falls in love with a famous musician who is disgusted by Warhol's world. Like a spurned lover, Warhol turns vengeful and sadistic, and Edie, past her "it girl" prime, self-destructs.

The purpose of dance music, I think, is to turn you on. This CD turns me on. It makes my head spin and my booty shake. What's so cool about this CD is the way that every song sounds different, and yet, despite the army of guest vocalists, every song still sounds distinctly like Basement Jaxx. The opening track &quot;Good Luck&quot; features lyrics reminiscent of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, and yet the music turns it into a bona-fide dance epic. J.C. Chasez sounds even better on the liquidy &quot;Plug It In&quot; than he does on BT's &quot;Force of Gravity&quot;, and MeShell Ndegeocello adds sultry vocals to both &quot;Right Here's the Spot&quot;, a blatant carnal come-on, and &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, a seductive lullaby that closes the CD. If you like dance, pop, or R&amp;B music, buy this album. You won't regret it.

This morality tale is kept afloat by Colin Farrell's performance. The story of two hit men temporarily staying in Bruges after a botched job in which a child was inadvertently killed is really dark and sad, but Farrell brings a charm and comic touch to his character that keeps the film from being too depressing. His character maintains a strange innocence so that even when doing terrible things, the audience can continue to find him sympathetic. Playing the perfect yang to Farrell's yin is Ralph Fiennes, who plays the hitmen's unrepentant, psychotic boss.Ultimately, the film asks whether it's possible to escape the consequences and find redemption after doing something horrible. The answers appear to be no and maybe.

&quot;Homogenic&quot; is appropriately titled, because unlike the diverse &quot;Post&quot;, it has a much more uniform sound. Sonically, it's a combination of inventive techno beats and classical orchestration. Lyrically, the tone of the album is set with the first track &quot;Hunter&quot;: Bjork seems to be &quot;hunting&quot; for love and peace of mind, both through intimate relations and within herself. &quot;Joga&quot;, a gorgeous love song, is one of my favorite Bjork songs ever, with Bjork crooning &quot;All that no one sees, you see what's inside of me&quot; over evocative strings and an arctic beat. With &quot;5 Years&quot;, Bjork scolds a lover for his emotional unavailability, but then scolds herself in &quot;Immature&quot; for looking to others to complete herself. &quot;Alarm Call&quot; is the album's most upbeat track, with Bjork imploring the listener to embrace joy, and &quot;Pluto&quot;, an homage to the disturbed fan who committed suicide after sending her a bomb in the mail, is an abrasive explosion of sounds. The album ends on a subdued and pleasant note with &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, which is almost hymn-like in its theme of surrender and unity.Overall, this is a gorgeous, inspired and groundbreaking album. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves music.

It's nice when a film that's been praised so much actually lives up to the hype. That's definitely the case with this excellent film. &quot;Lost in Translation,&quot; Sofia Coppola's follow-up to her remarkable debut, &quot;The Virgin Suicides,&quot; is a beautiful, subtle, funny and touching film. The uncomplicated plot revolves around two Americans staying in Tokyo; a middle-aged movie star (Bill Murray) and the young wife of a photographer (Scarlett Johansson). Both characters are lonely, isolated, and experiencing serious culture shock, so despite their age difference they come together to form a sincere and tender bond. The dazzling visuals of Tokyo and the droll humor of the supporting characters enhance the film, but never distract from the relationship between the leads that is the film's core. Bravo!(PS, an added guilty pleasure: The annoying blond actress portrayed by Anna Farris in the film is rumored to a parody of Cameron Diaz!)

Simon Cowell has said that the true appeal of "American Idol" is not that America gets to create stars out of those it deems the most talented and charismatic, but in the cruelty derived from watching the early audition contestants make fools of themselves. There's something so appealing in watching people so delusional about their strengths, skill, and talent, and so seduced by ambition and the desire for attention, that they completely humiliate themselves publicly in search of the wrong dream.This Schadenfreude, the taking of joy in the misfortune of others, is what makes "The Room" so appealing.Tommy Wiseau was obviously ambitious and hardworking enough to get a movie made, which he wrote, directed and stars in. Sadly, what he lacks is any talent or skill, as either a writer, director, or actor, and the result is a train wreck of such epic proportions that it has become a camp and cult classic.I'll admit it: I watched it. I laughed. It's jaw-droppingly bad. But I don't intend on repeat viewings. (I've never been a fan of AI either.)

The best horror films don't merely provide lots of gore and bloodletting, but tap into the primal fears of human beings, as well as the darkest parts of human nature. "Splice" does just that.Audience reactions seem to be mixed to "Splice", and it's easy to see why. "Splice" is really more of an art film that has more in common with David Cronenberg's films than mainstream horror fare like the "Saw" franchise. The film even stars Sarah Polley, an indie film fixture.Polley plays Elsa, who, along with her husband and fellow geneticist Clive (Adrian Brody), create a human/animal hybrid in secret, who they later name Dren ("nerd" spelled backwards, a cute way of the two embracing their science geek status). As in all horror films, playing with mother nature turns out to have disastrious consequences.Although films have long been using this basic plot that goes all the way back to "Frankenstein," what elevates "Splice" is its great script and acting. Elsa and Clive's relationship, which is both collaborative and competitive, facilitates the whole nightmare, as well as Elsa's tragic backstory as an abused, rural kid.What steals the show, however, is Dren. The film manages to make the creature both childlike, animalistic, and freakishly sexual, which is not only disarming for the audience, but leads to the disturbing plot developments in the film's controversial last act.

On the surface, "The Dreamers" is a story of an American student in 1960's Paris who becomes tangled up in a strange relationship with a twin brother and sister. I suppose you could enjoy the film just for the plentiful displays of naked young flesh. But I actually found that I got much more out of it than that. I think the underlying theme of the film is actually hinted at in its very title, "The Dreamers" ... the main characters in the film are not only obsessed with each other, they also share an obsession with film. It's as if by focusing on a movie screen or by isolating themselves and inventing sexual drama, they can ignore the tumultuous world around them. Unfortunately for them, a person can only ignore the world around them for so long, and toward the end of the film the world quite literally comes crashing through their window and forces them to deal with reality.This film could easily have just been a cliche, but I found it to be genuinely thought-provoking and complex.

Ten years after its release, this album still really holds up. Even if this music was released today, I think it would still sound fresh. Nirvana, as a band, had an incredible energy and skill that beautifully complemented Kurt Cobain's poetic lyrics and wounded vocals. The pain, rage, and self-loathing in the music is so real and so sincere that it speaks to the wounded child in everyone. Because of this, the music has a strangely innocent quality to it. This album is just as much an antidote to the cheesy, contrived rock music of today as it was an antidote to the cheesy, contrived rock music of the early 1990's.

"Happiness" is the most disturbing film I have ever seen (and I am not someone who's easily disturbed). It's also excellent. It explores the darker side of human nature in a way that's not only incredibly brave, but incredibly funny. An arrogant writer becomes infatuated with an obscene phone caller. A pedophile psychiatrist drugs his family so he can have sex with his son's friend. An overweight woman is raped by a midget bellhop, and then kills him. These are just a few of the many twisted stories that play out in this complicated and unsettling film.

I read this book a few years ago (knowing almost nothing about Timothy Leary, except his status as a 60's icon) and really enjoyed it. It helped me to redefine the way I think about pleasure and society's relationship to it. I was raised with such a puritanical &quot;if it feels good, it must be evil&quot; way of thinking that Leary's point of view - &quot;if it feels good, it's probably good for you&quot; - was downright liberating for me. Although I don't subscribe to everything Leary says in the book (for example, I don't think doing LSD once a week is a good idea), his essays are always provocative and full of food for thought. Even if you're put off by Leary's associations with hippie and drug cultures, I'd still recommend reading this book. Leary was an intelligent man with ideas worth listening to.

** 1/2"Bel Ami" aspires to be a period drama that explores privileged people using marriage, romance, and sex in order to social climb, make money, or sometimes just inflict emotional damage on their enemies. Films like "Dangerous Liaisons," "The Age of Innocence" and even the recent "Cheri" have all mined similar territory with, unfortunately, far superior results.Robert Pattison plays Georges, a soldier from a poor background who uses his looks and charm to burrow his way into Paris' aristocratic society via seducing and bedding powerful women. His first conquest is a wife of a wealthy businessman (Christina Ricci); his second, the wife of his boss at the newspaper he works, Madeleine (Uma Thurman, giving the film's best performance by far); his third, the wife of the newspaper's publisher (a wasted Kristen Scott Thomas, whom he beds not because he even finds her attractive, but as an act of pure revenge) and finally, the publisher's daughter (whom he marries out of pure strategy)."The most important people in Paris are not the men. It's the women," advises Madeleine. Madeleine quickly emerges as the smartest and shrewdest character in the film. Due to her gender, she's been forced to learn to influence and manipulate behind-the-scenes, however, she is also not above brutal honesty when appropriate. When her husband dies and Georges proposes marriage, she tells him "I am not like other women. I will not tolerate authority, jealousy, or you questioning my behavior." Georges marries her anyway, but she wears the pants in the relationship, and doesn't let him forget it for a moment. In fact, the more wealth and superficial success Georges attains, the more enraged the character becomes, as the various people around him seem to delight in constantly reminding him that he is, in essence, nothing more than a glorified gigolo.Georges, as a character, is supposed to be ruthless, charming, not terribly intelligent, and hopelessly out of his depth much of the time. Unfortunately, Robert Pattison as an actor is in the same boat. His performance isn't terrible, but when compared to charismatic and experienced actresses like Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and Kristen Scott Thomas, he comes across as an amateur. And since the film depends so much on his performance, and the film's script and direction are merely adequate, the film itself ends up mediocre.

Written by Charlie Kaufman (writer of the wonderfully bizarre "Being John Malkovich") and directed by Michel Gondry (director of many of Bjork's amazingly inventive videos), I knew I would like "Eternal Sunshine". I expected it to be clever, interesting and fun. What I didn't expect was that it would turn out to be such a touching and poignant love story as well. I'm not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but he does very well here, going against type to play a subdued character who constantly refers to himself as "not that interesting". It's actually the luminous Kate Winslet (still radiantly gorgeous, even with blue hair) who plays the zany, unpredictable one, who Jim Carrey's character is drawn to, like a moth to a flame. The story has a slight sci-fi premise to it, with the two main characters trying to erase their memories of one another and their tumultuous relationship, but this film is really about love, relationships, fate and forgiveness. Aside from the love story involving the lead characters, there's also an interesting subplot involving the employees of the "memory erasing" agency, with Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood all giving terrific supporting performances. All in all, a terrific film.

I love pop music when it's done right. And when it's done right it's fun, creative, sexy and easy to digest. I'd say this album qualifies on all those counts. After flirting with alternative ("Impossible Princess"), disco ("Light Years"), and technopop ("Fever"), "Body Language" may just be Kylie's best album so far. "Body Language" has an early 80's electro-funk feel to it that really works with Kylie's sexy, girly vocals. Some of the influences I can hear musically include early Prince, Basement Jaxx, and Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam. Highlights of this CD are the slinky opening track "Slow", the sexually charged "Secret" (whose bassline sounds strikingly similar to Prince's classic D.M.S.R.), the uplifting "Sweet Music" and the sensous, romantic "Chocolate".

"In the Zone" employs an army of A-list producers and songwriters (Moby, R. Kelly, Guy Sigsworth, etc.), so it's no surprise that this CD is full of tight beats and cool sound effects. But this album is all style and no substance. Even though Britney supposedly wrote 7 of these songs, we learn absolutely nothing about her other than the fact that she's hot, she likes to party, and she broke up with her boyfriend (all of which we already knew). There's also an incredible hypocrisy at work here. Britney pants and moans through almost every track on this CD, and yet in interviews she still strikes her virginal pose, claiming celibacy. If she's telling the truth, what we have here is a girl willing to exploit her sexuality for the sake of her career, but unwilling to enjoy it in real life. That's a screwed up message to send young girls.

What I love about watching a (good) documentary film is that in real life there are no heroes or villains or stock characters, just complicated real people who have complicated relationships and do things for reasons sometimes even they don't understand. "Capturing the Friedmans" is an engrossing film with a dual motive: it explores both the lynch-mob justice in a child molestation case, and also the affects such allegations have on a family that, on the surface, seems incredibly ordinary.In "Capturing the Friedmans" we are introduced to Arnold Friedman, convicted child molester, and he comes across as a nebbish, congenial, albeit self-loathing man who seems to love his children as much as he hates himself for his pedophile tendencies. His three sons, who adore him, defend their father, who they believe without a shadow of a doubt is innocent (even when faced with his own admissions that he has, in fact, molested boys before) to the bitter end. Mrs. Friedman, who I think I'm in the minority for feeling sympathy for, is a dutiful, if somewhat cold, wife and mother who either had no idea her husband was a pedophile or was in extreme denial about it. Tragically, she finds herself the pariah of the family after her husband's arrest, due to her ambivalence about his guilt.I love it when a film leaves you with more questions than answers, and "Capturing the Friedmans" does just that. By the end of the film, you're left with absolutely no clear answers about exactly how much child abuse Arnold Friedman (or his son Jesse) actually perpetrated. All you're left with is profound sympathy for a family completely shattered.

As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's."New Power Generation" serves as the title track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto. "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one trick gets boring quickly.It's obvious that with "Graffiti Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums.

"Dirty Mind" shows how, even this early in his career, Prince was a genius when it came to straddling the line between the underground and the mainstream. On the cover Prince, clad in bikini underwear, trench coat and bandana, looks like he might have just left an S&M bar. But most of the songs on the album aren't nearly as outrageous as you'd expect from the cover. Musically, the album is a fairly straightforward blend of R&B, disco and synth-pop. Although the demo quality of the tracks does gives it a raw, unpolished edge. Maybe in 1980 the lyrics to tracks like "Do It All Night" and "Dirty Mind" were shocking, but they seem downright tame today. Lyrically, only the incestuous "Sister" still has the power to raise eyebrows. Overall, I'd say "Dirty Mind" is an interesting album that shows the early stages of Prince's musical experimentation and evolution.

I enjoyed the "Sex and the City" series, which chronicled the lives of four successful single women in New York City. The series ended its 7 season run gracefully, with the characters evolving from (mostly) 30-something, slightly self-absorbed singles to mature women embracing mature relationships and, in some cases, motherhood.The most frustating thing about the "Sex and the City" movie is that, although five years have gone by, these characters do not seem to have evolved at all. If anything, they seem to have backslid into the same immature cycles that they were in during the series. Once again, Carrie is jilted by committment-phobe Mr. Big, then takes him back. Once again, Miranda harshly rejects Steve after he makes a mistake, then takes him back. Once again, Samantha realizes that she's just not the type of person meant for a traditional, monogamous relationship. The only character who seems to have really grown up is Charlotte, who is flourishing in a strong marriage and as a mother. But her character is given little to do, other than comfort the other three women as they continue wallowing in self-inflicted misery.On a superficial note, fashion was always a big part of the "Sex and the City" series, and the clothes always towed the line between stylish and over-the-top. But the outfits in this movie are hideous ... hardly a scene passed by where I didn't find myself thinking "What the hell ...?"Although it was nice to see the actresses and characters reunited, let's hope the sequel has a better script, and that these characters are given the chance to grow and evolve. The actresses, and the audience, deserve it.

With "Back to Black", Amy Winehouse has managed to do something other artists often try to do and fail: invoke the past, add the contemporary and still make it true and not gimmicky. Winehouse juxtaposes melodies and harmonies that recall girl groups from the 1960's and adds beats and lyrics that are modern and urban; mixing it all together into a dark, atmospheric stew. The result is a beautifully executed album. My only criticism is that I sometimes get the feeling that she's holding back a bit ... hiding behind her clever musical technique. The album's best (and title) track, "Back to Black", aches with a raw longing and pain and emotion that I'd like to hear more of. But at 23, Amy Winehouse still has plenty of time to grow into her formidable talent. I'm looking forward to hearing more from her.

"Gia" is a decent film that is elevated due to the extraordinary performance of Angelina Jolie as the title character. Jolie won a Golden Globe for her brilliant portrayal of a young woman who was intensely sexual, deeply vulnerable, vivacious, and self-destructive. The film covers Gia's life as she goes from being a punky kid to the world's first supermodel. Along the way she has plenty of access to drugs and easy sex, but few opportunities for real love and support. Tragically, she contracted AIDS from her IV drug use and died before she was able to create a meaningful life for herself. The film is a little exploitive when it comes to portraying Gia's lesbian relationship, but Jolie's performance elevates the film above pure titillation.

Talk about false advertising. The cover of this DVD makes it look like a cheesy, exploitation revenge movie. It's not. The first two thirds of the film is actually a disturbingly realistic portrayal of the complete victimization of a person. Michelle is a shy, smart, attractive and poor girl who is sent to school in an affluent area in order to receive the educational benefits. She prefers reading alone to trying to compete with her rich, shallow classmates, until a charming athlete convinces her to go to a house party with the cool kids. By the end of the night Michelle is drugged, gang-raped, degraded and humiliated. Following the ordeal, everyone in her life, including her own mother, blames her for everything, and her reputation is destroyed.There is nothing melodramatic about the way the film depicts Michelle's transformation from devastated victim to avenging assassin. And although the film ceases to be realistic when Michelle begins murdering both the boys who raped her and the girls who turned on her, it's satisfying.

I've honestly never really been a fan of Joan Rivers. Although I love stand-up comedy, perhaps Joan's public persona as a plastic surgery cautionary tale, red carpet pest, and daytime talk show host had blinded me to her comedy accomplishments. I started to see her in a different light recently when I saw her roast on Comedy Central, which made me curious to check out this acclaimed documentary.After seeing this film, it's hard not to like Joan. At 75, Joan Rivers has clearly gotten to the point in her life where she's no longer interested in apologizing for herself or trying to be anyone she's not. The film offers an honest portrait of a real woman who is made up of passions, flaws, idiosyncrasies, insecurities, relationships, emotions, and all of the other complicated, messy things of life. Joan comes across as ambitious, hardworking, frank, big-hearted, generous, passionate, and, of course, very funny. She also comes across as needy, vain, grasping, opportunistic, self-pitying, and self-absorbed. In a nutshell, she comes across as human.Probably one of the most fascinating and insightful theories that the film perpetuated about Joan is that she is less a comedian than an actress playing the role of a comedian. Born without perhaps the beauty or sexual charisma to be a theatrical diva, Joan created her comedic persona in order to attain the attention, accolades, and ability to connect with an audience that she so clearly needed, and, at age 75, still needs.

The homemade, do-it-yourself charm of their previous album, "Coming on Strong", is gone from Hot Chip's new effort "The Warning". Luckily, none of the warmth, playfulness, humor or sensitivity is. If anything, being on a major label seems to work well for Hot Chip. The beats are tighter and leaner, and they blend much more seamlessly with the vocals. The occasionally experimental production may sometimes recall artists like Aphex Twin, but the songs themselves are pure pop; smooth, catchy, and easy to digest.

With cookie-cutter teen comedies a dime a dozen, this film manages to combine realistic and empathetic teen characters, an intriguing science fiction premise, black comedy, and just plain weirdness to create a startlingly original film. Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Donnie Darko, a highly intelligent and mentally ill young man who is perceptive enough to see through the phoniness of many of the adults around him, but still vulnerable and awkard in the endearing way teenagers are. Some of the characters who inhabit his world include his smug, Harvard-bound older sister (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a cheesy self-help guru (Patrick Swayze), the mysterious new girl in school (Jena Malone) and an idealistic teacher (Drew Barrymore). Time travel, a talking demonic rabbit, vandalism, a Star Search-bound dance troupe called &quot;Sparkle Motion&quot; ... these are all some of the plot twists that lead the film along to it's ambiguous and thought-provoking conclusion. Check it out!

When watching "Young Adult", I couldn't help but think of this year's "Bad Teacher". The two films have a similar central character: an aging former "Queen Bee", still beautiful, but also still stuck in adolescent, immature delusions about how her life should be (as well as a penchant for substance abuse). However, while "Bad Teacher" was a low-brow, lightweight comedy, "Young Adult" aims much higher, and although it has moments of humor, is a serious and often painful character study.Mavis left her small town home of Mercury to move to Minneapolis, where she has had a fairly successful career as a writer of young adult fiction. In her personal life, she has become isolated and lonely, filling up her time with excessive drinking and one-night-stands. When she receives an email notice that her former high school sweetheart, Buddy, had recently become a father, she develops a bizarre and unlikely plan to go back to her home town and win him back.And so it begins. Although affable Buddy is happy to meet Mavis for a friendly drink, he is clearly content with his life as a husband (to a fun and compassionate woman) and new father, and has no romantic interest in Mavis. Clueless, Mavis continues her pursuit of Buddy, believing that the two are meant to be together and that he secretly feels trapped in his small town life. The more Mavis continues her pursuit, the more she humiliates herself, revealing her immaturity and desperation.While staying in Mercury, Mavis does also make a genuine connection to Matt, a former classmate still physically crippled by a brutal attack in high school. Despite superficial differences the two have a lot in common: they're both stuck, unable to move on from the past, and share a love of excessive drinking. Matt, as disappointed and angry as Mavis, is probably the only person in the film to tell her the truth about herself.Charlize Theron gives a terrific, nuanced performance, and is willing to explore her character at both as her most humorous and bitchy as well as at her most pathetic and pitiful. And Patrick Wilson and Patton Oswold both create fleshed out human beings out of characters who could have easily been two dimensional. "Young Adult" is not always an easy film to watch, but it's definitely a cut above the average Hollywood studio film.

I'm not a big Steve Martin fan, but for some reason I decided to see this movie. I'm glad I did, it was really funny. Instead of being a generic comedy that gets its laughs from racial stereotypes, it's actually more like a parody of generic comedies that get their laughs from racial stereotypes. Some of the jokes are so over the top that they'd be uncomfortable to watch if they weren't so funny (Joan Plowright singing an incredibly offensive negro spiritual is one that comes to mind). Queen Latifah's got charisma to spare, and she has good chemistry with Steve Martin. The supporting cast is hilarious, especially Eugene Levy (who falls in love with Latifah's character, who he calls a &quot;cocoa goddess&quot;), Joan Plowright (who at one point gets high and asks for the nearest all night diner) and Betty White (who plays a character about as ignorant and bigoted as they come). Overall, a very enjoyable comedy.

I loved the original "Basic Instinct". Sure, it was trashy, but it was also fun, sexy, thrilling and just totally watchable. And it was Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Trammel, a rich, beautiful psychopath who manipulates and kills for the sheer entertainment of it, that really made the film.Flash forward 14 years, and Basic Instinct 2, the long-awaited sequel, is by far the worst film I've seen this year. It's not that Sharon Stone isn't still sexy, or that she can't act (in fact, I just saw her on the premiere of "Huff" last night, and she was beautiful and brilliantly funny). And it's also not that the rest of the cast isn't completely capable. It's just that the script and direction are terrible.Instead of taking the character of Catherine Trammel to the next level, showing how a brilliant female psychopath might have evolved over 14 years into an even more chillingly diabolical woman, the script takes the character and turns her into a combination of a foul-mouthed adolescent and an over-the-hill tramp. In the first film, when Catherine seduced and destroyed the boorish, hapless San Francisco detectives, it was completely believable. But when Catherine's victims in the new film, who are supposed to be some of the most brilliant and accomplished psychiatrists in London, are so easily manipulated by Catherine when she's behaving like a bratty piece of wannabe Eurotrash, it's just completely unbelievable.

After perfecting their rock-techno-pop hybrid on "Version 2.0", Garbage clearly decided it was time to experiment a little with their sound. Their third CD, "Beautiful Garbage", is a little softer, a little friendlier, and a little more diverse than their previous efforts. So whereas songs like "Shut Your Mouth" and "Breaking Up the Girl" are pretty standard Garbage rock-outs, tracks like "Cup of Coffee" and "Drive You Home" almost completely venture into bona fide pop ballad territory. "Til The Day I Die" effectively flirts with hip-hop, and "Can't Cry" plays like a creepy parody of 60's girl-groups. My favorite track on the album, the glorious "Cherry Lips" (a tribute to author J.T.LeRoy), combines everything good about both the old and new Garbage sounds: it's edgy, sexy, catchy, fun and intelligent. So although "Beautiful Garbage" isn't as tight and cohesive a collection of songs as "Version 2.0", you have to give props to a band for being willing to experiment and take risks, especially when the results are, for the most part, excellent.

Lindsay Lohan received most of the blame for the critical and box-office failure of "Georgia Rule", but it really wasn't fair at all. Her performance, as a promiscuous, damaged teenager, is fine. And her seasoned co-stars, Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Dermot Mulroney, are all excellent in their respective roles.What spoils the film is that it's just hopelessly uneven. It constantly shifts in tone from breezy comedy to melodrama. Most of the blame should probably be assigned to director Gary Marshall, who has made similar errors with films before (like "Exit to Eden", which couldn't decide if it was a goofy comedy or an erotic romance).The shifts in tone make it almost impossible for the viewer to really sympathize with the characters. During the comedic scenes, all three generations of women (Fonda's "Georgia", Huffman's "Lili" and Lohan's "Rachel") draw laughs for their harsh bravado, which, although amusing, is never likable. And during the most melodramatic scenes, the characters all come across as hopelessly damaged and pathetic."Georgia Rule" is an unfortunate case of a Hollywood film squandering a great cast.

On her impressive debut album, Lily Allen isn't trying to sound wise beyond her years, and that's a good thing. Listening to "Alright, Still" you get an authentic view inside the head of a 21-year-old girl. Like most 21-year-olds, she's a bit obsessed with romantic relationships, and she's quick to blame the guy when things go sour ("Smile", "Not Big"). She likes going out, but hates when cheesy, unattractive guys hit on her ("Knock 'Em Out") or when other girls get confrontational or competitive ("Friday Night"). She hates when older people give condescending, unsolicited advice ("Take What You Take"), and she's already old enough to have experienced some of the frustrations and disappointments of adult life ("Everything's Just Wonderful"). And she's just starting to become more observant and concerned about the world around her, either when she sees muggers or prostitutes in her native London ("LDN") or when she sees her younger brother wasting his life away by smoking too much reefer ("Alfie").With bright, pastiche music and spunky, witty lyrics, "Alright, Still" showcases a fresh, rising new talent.

Lars Von Trier is a sadist. With &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, he continues the same theme of his beautifully bleak previous film &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;: He constructs a lead character that is loving, innocent, pure and humble, and then proceeds to have that character systematically degraded, humiliated, abused and finally killed. For what purpose? Most likely to show that modern society is no place for innocents. It's a dog eat dog world, and Von Trier doesn't want us to forget it.Painful as it is to watch, this is a great film. The musical numbers that take place in Selma's head are a wonderful contrast to the gray, uninspired world she inhabits in real life. And Bjork is absolutely heartbreaking and mesmerizing playing one of the most tragic characters ever seen on screen. I recommend this film, but be warned ... it may ruin your week.

This movie is a comedy, and a comedy should make you laugh. This movie makes me laugh. Made in 1989, not long after Roseanne's excellent sitcom had begun its run, Roseanne had perhaps not come into her own as an actress. However, she is still well cast as a frumpy housewife named Ruth whose tacky accountant husband Bob leaves her for a spoiled romance novelist named Mary Fischer. As a revenge fantasy, there is some satisfaction in seeing Ruth systematically destroy her husband's life. And there are some extremely funny supporting characters, particularly Mary Fischer's maniacally uncouth mother and Bob and Ruth's bratty, manic children, who all contribute to Bob's undoing. But the best moments of the film belong to Meryl Streep. Normally known for her dramatic work, Streep is absolutely hysterical at playing a self-absorbed, tantrum-throwing, pretentious, ... wanna-be diva. "She-devil" is definitely worth seeing for a few laughs.

This book is not only my favorite autobiography, but it's also one of my favorite books of any genre. Francis Farmer, the infamous movie star who ended up institutionalized, was a tortured woman. This autobiography, which she wrote shortly before her death, is an extremely well-written, brutally honest, and mostly unflattering self-portrait. She tells of her relationship with her controlling and insane mother (who committed her), her unintentional rise to fame in Hollywood (she wanted to be a theater actress, and found Hollywood mostly empty), her emotional breakdowns, run-ins with the law, drinking problems, loveless marriages, and her time spent in a horrific state mental institution. Despite it all, Francis Farmer doesn't seem to feel a lot of self-pity, and she admirably takes responsibility for much of what happened to her. What really makes the book touching is Francis' description of what ultimately saved her: her friendship with Jean Radcliffe (who published the book after Francis died). Toward the end of her life Francis was able to find a lot of love and happiness, mostly due to the unconditional support she received from Jean and her family. This makes the book not only a juicy tale of a fallen Hollywood star and a disturbing memoir of a mental hospital, but an ultimately inspiring story about the healing power of love and friendship.

Judging from the other reviews, I am apparently one of many Prince fans who have chosen "Sign o' the Times" as their favorite Prince album. I see it as the absolute pinnacle of the creative peak that began with "Purple Rain" and ended somewhere in between "Lovesexy" and the New Power Generation. Here we have seventeen tracks that showcase all the sides of Prince's personality that his fans have grown to love: Social critic ("Sign o' the Times"), spiritual seeker ("The Cross"), romantic ("Forever in my Life", "Adore"), and, of course, horndog ("U Got the Look", "It", "Hot Thing"). And then there are the songs that sort of defy musical or lyrical categorization, and are probably the strongest tracks of all: "If I Was Your Girlfriend" starts off as a romantic desire to get to know a lover better, and then turns into a strange stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasy. "Housequake" could have been a generic party anthem, but with lyrics like "Don't wait for your neighbors/green eggs and ham!" takes strange forays into fantasyland. One of my favorite tracks, the mellow "Ballad of Dorothy Parker" is an intruiging song that is either a nod to the famous writer or a character study of a witty, sexy waitress, or maybe both. It's this unpredictability, as well as his ability to make music that is both bizarre and accessable at the same time, that makes Prince one of the greatest artists in rock history.

****1/2I am late getting on the "Bourne" bandwagon. I just watched the first two films in the series for the first time last weekend after years of avoiding them. My impression? That so far, the "Bourne" films deserve all of the praise and success that they've received."The Bourne Identity" manages to take a story with a myriad of cliches (the super spy, the spy with amnesia, secret government experiments and cover-ups, etc, etc, etc) and still make a film that's fresh, exciting, intelligent and engrossing.So the question is, why does this film excel when so many other action films fall flat? First, the film utilizes an excellent cast. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is the thinking man's action hero, bringing a complexity to the role that flies in the face of the typical cocky, wisecracking American action hero. Veteran actors like Chris Cooper and Brian Cox bring gravitas to their supporting roles, and Franka Potente brings an international, quirky sex appeal to her role as Jason's love interest.As great as the performers are, the script and direction also really deliver. Although the action scenes are all wonderfully executed, the film makes sure not to sacrifice character development either. Jason Bourne is a man who has lost his identity, and as a result is able to regain the humanity he has clearly lost in his previous life as an assassin.

If this CD were a painting, it would be an impressionist landscape. It's soft, dreamy, ethereal, abstract and yet not totally divorced from reality. The album is full of lullabies for world-weary grown-ups who might need to be reminded to stop and smell the roses, and remember that life is beautiful.

The thrilling "Millenium trilogy" comes to a close with "The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest". If "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" was more of a mystery/thriller, and "The Girl Who Played with Fire" was more of an action/thriller, "The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest" defies expectations and ends up being more of a courtroom drama/thriller.When last we found Lisbeth, she had survived a handful of gunshot wounds at the hands of her monstrous father and thug half-brother, although, unfortunately, both had survived as well. At the beginning of the film we find Lisbeth in the hospital, recovering slowly from her wounds, while facing an attempted murder charge for assaulting her father with an axe. For the first half of the film, Lisbeth is frail and vulnerable, sequestered in the hospital, being cared for by a compassionate doctor who, along with Mikael, is one of the few people (especially men) in her life who shows kindness toward her. This allows actress Noomi Rapace to show another side to her character, and even when Lisbeth is quiet and subdued she radiates defiant charisma, and a magentic combination of strength and vulnerability. This really is one of the best characters in recent cinema.Meanwhile, Mikael, whose story is ever-entwined with Lisbeth's (despite the fact that they have shared little screen time together since the first film), is planning a special issue of his magazine to expose the systemic corruption that has allowed Lisbeth to be repeatedly abused and violated. Mikael also enlists his fiesty attorney sister to provide legal counsel to Lisbeth.This time most of the action and battles take place in the courtroom, where Lisbeth confronts every one of the monsters in her life. The problem is that the entire system is committed to keeping Lisbeth quiet and having her discredited. Her father, a defected Russian spy, was being illegally protected by the government, and following Lisbeth's violent assault on him when she was twelve, Lisbeth was illegally institutionalized and declared mentally incompetent. Although her evil father and Guardian are dead by the time we get to the courtroom, Lisbeth's predatory psychiatrist, as well as the rest of the rogue government operatives who protected her father, are all heavily invested in keeping her quiet.Lisbeth, ever committed to refusing to play the role of the victim, shows up to court looking like a gothic warrior. With much help from Mikael and his sister, Lisbeth finally gets the chance to publicly tell - and prove - her story, exposing the monsters who violated her and the system that allowed it. The courtroom scenes are riveting, as they depict the catharsis of the demons from Lisbeth's past being exposed.

British novelist Sarah Morton is wealthy, successful and attractive. She's also bored, cynical, uptight and experiencing writer's block. So, at her smarmy publisher's suggestion, she retreats to his French villa to work on her next novel. She is just beginning to enjoy the peace and quiet and beautiful surroundings when, unexpectedly, her publisher's young, promiscuous daughter shows up. The two antagonize each other at first, but eventually form a tenuous friendship tinged with jealousy, sexual tension and strange mind games.What I loved about this film is that it gives the viewer some space and room to breathe. The film starts off slowly and subtly, gently setting the scene for what eventually escalates into a surprising and titillating thriller. However, as erotically charged as the film is, at its core this film is a fascinating study of a writer's imagination and creative process.

First of all, I'd like to say that "Catwoman", although not a good film by any means, isn't the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. In fact, I'd argue that last year's "Daredevil" was worse. This film isn't horribly acted or directed; it's just ill-conceived, with a shabby premise and a mediocre script.Instead of spinning off the Selina Kyle character wonderfully adapted from the comics (and brilliantly played by Michelle Pfeiffer) in "Batman Returns", the masterminds behind "Catwoman" made the decision to create a brand new Catwoman character, this one with actual superhuman, cat-like powers and abilities. The result is that this film not only betrays the built-in fan base of comic book fans, but fails to deliver an interesting or exciting substitute for catburglar Selina Kyle.Halle Berry tries hard to rise above the material, and she does a fairly good job at playing both mousy graphic designer Patience Phillips and feisty, sexy Catwoman. And given the right material, Sharon Stone, icy and diabolical, could have been a wonderful villianess. It's just that both actresses are doomed by the script, premise, and in Halle's case, RIDICULOUS costume design.This movie should serve as a warning for the film studios: When adapting a film from a comic book, it's okay to take slight liberties to make the film work, but if you completely betray the original creation, you're doomed to failure.

Linda Fiorentino gives the performance of her career in "The Last Seduction" playing Bridget Gregory, who is the most ruthless, callous, mean, greedy and fascinating woman possibly ever seen on screen. In the beginning of the film, Bridget gets her doctor husband (Bill Pullman) to make a pharmaceautical drug deal for almost a million dollars, after which she takes off with the cash leaving her husband pennilness. Then she temporarily locates to a small town, where she begins to manipulate a pathetic smalltown buffoon (Peter Berg, who she also treats as a human vibrator) into killing her husband. Linda Fiorentino is just such a blast playing Bridget that instead of hating her, you root for her. As rotten to the core as she is, you cheer as she constantly manipulates and destroys the hapless men around her, and emerges victorious. This movie is great to watch whenever you're in a bad mood ... it always cheers me up.

"Kill Bill volume 1" was a thrilling, intense, stylized, gory bloodbath with occasional poignant moments of character development and backstory. We saw the Bride in full-on revenge mode, hacking to pieces anyone who got in the way of her killing the assassins that turned her wedding rehearsal into a massacre. What we have with "Kill Bill volume 2" is actually a perfect yin to volume 1's yang: A poignant, character-driven, dialogue-heavy story with occasional moments of intense, stylized violence. In Volume 2, the focus is on the Bride's complex relationship with Bill, who was her mentor, lover, father figure and would-be killer. We come to understand the reasons why the Bride left the DiVAS to marry a record store owner, and what drove Bill to murder his former lover and protege. As with the last film, Uma Thurman handles every scene and scenario with incredible skill, poise and understated brilliance. David Carradine also gives a terrific performance as the charismatically evil Bill. Props to Tarantino for not just splitting one film in two, but actually creating two distinctly different films that complement and complete each other.

This is one of the most original books I've read in a long time. It would be easy to dismiss the book for a variety of reasons: the obscene cover artwork, the fact that it was written by a 20 year old (which I find very impressive, after reading it), the characters are disaffected teens who do a lot of drugs, etc. But I found it to be hilarious, insightful, imaginative, subversive and thoroughly enjoyable. It may not be a traditionally structured story, but it's not full of pointless gimmicks either. Nor is it a self-indulgent stream-of-consciousness mess. The author really just seemed to be following his instincts, and daring to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling. I think this is a young writer to watch out for.

"Margaret" was supposedly filmed 7-8 years ago, and for reasons I'm not sure of, sat on the shelf until finally a group of film critics advocated for its release. After watching it, I can understand why ... it's a difficult film, hard to categorize, but also rich, provocative and brilliant.The superficial storyline of the film involves a 17 year old girl, Lisa (Anna Paquin, looking much more natural than she does now in her toned, blond TrueBlood persona) who is indirectly involved in a fatal accident in which a woman is killed by a bus. Confused and guilt-ridden, she goes about trying to do the "right thing," which in her mind involves making sure those responsible (including herself) are held accountable, as well as trying to get justice for the deceased. But at every turn, her effort is met with the ambivalence, apathy, and bureaucracy of the adult world.However, as much as the film follows this dramatic central storyline, the film is also a portrait of all the much more mundane and subtle predicaments of being 17 years old. Lisa is no longer a child, and no longer coddled like one. She is expected to behave like an adult, but at the same time the other adults in her life constantly remind her of her youth and inexperience at every turn. She's impulsive and emotional, but also insightful and self-aware. She also wants to explore and experiment, and is aware of the power of her youthful sexuality, but also quickly finds out the repercussions of it. Around her are the archetypes of the kind of people most of us probably had in our lives at her age: her mother who is equal parts self-absorbed, caring, and clingy; the goodhearted but awkward friend who wants to date her; the experienced bad boy who she finds much more interesting; the pathetic teacher who is more interested in holding onto his tiny source of hubris than exploring a student's genuine ideas; and sadly, the one well-meaning, compassionate adult in her life who she hurts just because she can.Paquin's performance is formidable, and would probably be award-worthy if it wasn't so old. The film itself, by alternating between high drama and subtle character exploration, serves as one of the best depictions of modern adolescence I've seen. "Margaret" isn't a perfect film, but the fact that it's a flawed masterpiece might make it even more appealing.

Normally I don't think it's fair to compare musical artists to other musical artists, but while listening to "Wikked Lil' Grrrls" I couldn't help being reminded of other strong, talented women musicians. Esthero's smooth, seductive voice bears a strong resemblance to Sade's, especially on her more downtempo, jazz-influenced tracks like "Blanket Me In You". But on tracks like "In Tha Mood" and the riotous title track, her feistiness reminds me a little of Pink. And then when she mixes world beats with staccato phrasing on tracks like "Jungle", she reminds me of fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado.So does this all mean that Esthero is nothing more than a musical hybrid? Hell, no. Elements of her music may remind me of other artists, but there's still definitely something going on here that is distinctly her own. And, in the case of Nelly Furtado and Pink, it's conceivable that Esthero's music inspired their recent sounds, instead of the other way around. The truth is, there's nothing wrong with artists inspiring one another, and this is made even more evident by all the successful collaborations on "Wikked Lil' Girls".Overall, this is a smooth, sexy, playful, diverse effort from a talented female artist.

"Demian" is the first book I read by Hermann Hesse, and it got me hooked on his novels. This book is fascinating, so much so that it's difficult to describe. It's both a coming-of-age story (although I hate that term)and also a surreal and erotic delve into the subconscious. The themes of spirituality, sexuality, suffering and redemption are all weaved together in this novel, as they are in the other equally fascinating novels by Hesse I've read. I'd also highly recommend "Steppenwolf" and "Siddhartha".

What happens when a recently dumped straight man and his oafish best friend accidently find themselves on a gay cruise? A big mess. "Boat Trip" is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Filled with crude sexual humor and goofy sight gags, "Boat Trip" is rarely funny and often offensive. Apparently, the makers of this film were trying to cash in on the recent explosion of gay culture in the media, but after watching this film I have a funny feeling that the writers have never even met an actual gay person. Tired and ridiculous stereotypes are all this film really has to offer. Charming Cuba Gooding Jr. and sexy 'n sassy Vivca A. Fox should fire their agents immediately.

When it comes to Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller in "Interview", I don't think I've seen a middle aged man and a young woman that had this much chemistry since Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson in "Lost in Translation". However, if Murray and Johanson's on-screen relationship was warm and nurturing, the relationship between Buscemi's Pierre and Miller's Katya is more like a cage match.Pierre, a self-important political journalist, is assigned to do an interview with a subject he believes to be beneath him ... Katya, a schlock TV/film actress and tabloid fixture. The two characters clash instantly, but end up continuing the "interview" all night in Katya's opulent New York loft, where the two characters ridicule, antagonize, manipulate, charm, seduce and abuse one another, both for their own career agendas and to satisfy their equally inflated egos. Steve Buscemi (clearly a talented director as well as being a great character actor) and Sienna Miller both give terrific performances playing these two complex, layered and often repugnant characters. I found the whole thing fascinating.Toward the end of the film Pierre tells Katya "What do we both have in common? Neither of us believes in relationships. There's no equality ... there's always a winner and a loser." Watch the film to see which is which.

When "Weeds" moved from California suburbia to a Mexican border town in season 4, I was hoping that it would give the show the creative shot in the arm it needed. For a while, it seemed to work, and season 4 ended on an intense and serious note, with Nancy dealing with the ramifications of ratting out the drug tunnel that was also shipping girls into slavery.Season 5, sadly, was hopelessly uneven. The actors on the show are excellent (Especially Mary Louise Parker and Justin Kirk), but the writers have them all wandering around aimlessly, going from one hapless mess to another. The season started with Nancy in peril as her drug kingpin/mayor boyfriend tried to decide whether or not to kill her for her betrayal. Instead, upon verifying that Nancy is indeed pregnant with his son, he marries her and pledges love and devotion. Andy decides he's in love with Nancy and wants to be the father figure her children desperately need, but after Nancy jilts him he ends up in love with Nancy's gynecologist. Elizabeth Perkins is a wonderful actress, but her Celia character, as well as the handful of other Agrestic refugees, have little reason to be on the show anymore. The only character who develops in an interesting direction is Shane. His character has always been strange and offbeat, but it appears that finally,after years of living in chaos and moral deprivity thanks to his Mom, he's now become completely psychotic. The cliffhanger he provides by casually murdering Nancy's archnemesis is one of the best things in the season.The season does get a little help from its co-stars. Jennifer Jason Leigh was a terrific breath of fresh air as Nancy's sister. I wish they had extended her storyline and given her more to do. And Alanis Morisette gave a surprisingly charming performance as Nancy's doctor and Andy's love interest.Here's hoping that next season features better storylines and character development.

Nifty special affects, a massive budget, big stars and bared flesh do not make a film worth watching if the characters do not interest me. And the characters in "Troy" are about as flat and two-dimensional as they come. Vain, horny Trojan Prince Paris (pretty Orlando Bloom) falls for sulky, kept-woman Helen (almost-as-pretty Diane Kruger), which pisses off her husband, Spartan ruler Menelaus, and gives his megalomaniacal brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox, always playing the a-hole) an excuse to invade Troy. Achilles (a buff Brad Pitt) agrees to help, not because he cares, but just because he has a hang-up about having his name in the history books, and Paris' brother Hector (studly Aussie Eric Bana) and father King Priam (a dazed and confused Peter O'Toole) both sacrifice their lives and happiness for the sake of Paris' bratty antics."Troy" glorifies violence and aggressiveness, while dubiously suggesting that love and family are what's really important. With the exception of maybe Bana's Hector, the "great" and "epic" characters are all arrogant, whiny and selfish brats. All this I could forgive somehow, if "Troy" didn't commit the worst sin of all when it comes to big-budget, Hollywood films ... being boring.

I was totally digging this film until the very end. It was well written and well directed (I mean, it's Ridley Scott, he's terrific). Nicholas Cage excells at playing neurotic, oddball characters like OCD-inflicted con-artist Roy, Alison Lohman was adorable and conniving as Angela, and Sam Rockwell was charming and smarmy as Roy's partner-in-crime. The relationship between Roy and Angela was endearing and interesting, and although the "twists" in the film's plot were really no surprise, they still worked pretty well. I just didn't buy Roy's compete moral 180 at the end of the film. I just don't think a person who's spent his life getting rich on the wrong side of the law would really be willing to give it all up for the life Roy chooses at the end of the film.But who knows? Maybe I'm just cynical.

With a story based on an acclaimed science fiction novel, director Richard Linklater using the same cool rotoscoping technique he used in the sublime "Waking Life" and a cast of iconoclast actors, "A Scanner Darkly" seemed to have all the elements in place to make a great film. And although this isn't a bad film, it just doesn't ever quite click and become engrossing. Maybe it's because there have been so many far superior films that explored either the desperate paranoia of drug addiction ("Requiem for a Dream", "Trainspotting") or a "Big Brother is watching" dystopian future ("The Matrix", "V for Vendetta"). In any case, this film is probably worth watching for anyone who appreciates either the science fiction or drug film drama. But I doubt it will make many fans' top ten lists.

After flirting with a slightly darker and more mature sound on "Impossible Princess", Kylie Minogue returned to her pop roots with "Light Years". What makes this CD so charming and interesting is that instead of copying current pop music trends, Kylie borrows more from classic disco and showtunes, with a hint of modern techno thrown in. The result is a jubilant, tongue-in-cheek party album. And who can resist that?My favorite tracks are: "Disco Down" (a disco anthem, as if you couldn't tell by the title), "Koocachoo" (pure bubblegum pop), "Love Boat" (sounds like a kitschy showtune) and "Kids" (a duet with the equally sexy and campy Robbie Williams).

*** 1/2Steven Soderbergh is an interesting director. Even when his films are exploring lurid subjects, they always manage to come across as low-key, naturalistic character studies. It's almost as if, at this point, he likes to purposely challenge himself. With his last film, "Haywire," he managed to make a film about a female assassin feel like a low-key, naturalistic character study. So what did he choose for his next challenge? Making a film about male strippers into a low-key, naturalistic character study.And he succeeds. However, in doing so, he probably disappointed the majority of people who saw the film. Because the truth is, the film was marketed rather dishonestly. It was marketed as a rip-roaring parade of man candy - a debauched guilty pleasure. There are lots of beautiful men in the film, to be sure, but the film is very rarely sexy, never over-the-top, and too thoughtful and self-aware to be a guilty pleasure.The core of the story is about a man at a crossroads. The titular character, Mike, is a thirty-year-old veteran stripper/construction worker/aspiring furniture designer. He comes across as smooth talking but substance-less, but the film digs deeper and the truth is that he's begun to feel trapped by his lifestyle and is longing for a meaningful career and a meaningful relationship. He meets a young, impulsive 19-year-old at his construction job, and after a series of mishaps the boy, who he names "The Kid," ends up becoming Mike's stripper prot&eacute;g&eacute;. As "The Kid" begins to fall in love with his new stripper life, and all of the easy sex, money, drugs and other trappings that go along with it, Mike is able to see his own lifestyle from the outside, and starts looking for a way out. "I don't want to be a 40 year old stripper," Mike says, with obvious clarity.It's really not a bad film, and Steven Soderbergh manages to keep the whole thing from feeling like a trite morality tale. But those looking for sordid titillation should probably skip "Magic Mike" and stick with Showtime's "Gigolos."

When this movie came out in 1996, it was mostly ignored by the public. The problem was that it just happened to be several years ahead of its time. Before &quot;Lara Croft&quot;, &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, Geena Davis played one-woman-army Charlie Baltimore. She was really the first major actress to play this kind of role - a female superhero - and she did a damn fine job. Davis, who usually plays kooky or offbeat characters, is convincing and compelling at playing a woman trying to reconcile her past as a ruthless assassin with her present as a mother and schoolteacher. This movie is a fun, thrilling action film that also happens to star Oscar-calibar actors. I'd recommend checking it out and seeing what everybody missed out on 7 years ago.

Bjork found the world most of us live in to be boring and oppressive ... so she created her own.She's not a rebel who ignores "the rules"; I don't think she even knows what "the rules" are. She's an intuitive, instinctual creature, following her own muse. Somehow along the way she's been able to attain fame and mainstream success, but it never seems to really affect her. She can work with hit-making producer Timbaland (who recently helped turn Nelly Furtado into a mainstream artist) and simply use his inventive beats to add fuel to her iconic fire. "Innocence" is easily one of the album's best tracks, but I don't see it playing on TRL anytime soon. Bjork's most wonderful quality might be her ability to combine a bold need for revolution with unrestrained joy. On "Declare Independence", she strikes a punk pose. Anarchy never felt so cuddly.

As musical candy goes, you can't beat Kylie Minogue. Her girly, sexy, sugary dance/pop songs practically give you a cavity after too much listening. "Can't Get You Out of my Head", the insanely infectious song that re-introduced her to Americans, is probably the best track on this CD. Songs like "More More More" and "Come Into My World" are romantic and completely transparent carnal come-ons, and tracks like "Love Affair" and "In Your Eyes" are charming techno-infused dance tracks. As a pop icon, I'd put Kylie somewhere in between Madonna and Britney. Although no where near as challenging, arty or political as Madonna, Kylie has better pipes than Britney and serves up her sexual persona with tongue firmly in cheek. If you're just looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, you could do much worse.

For a network TV show, "Nip/Tuck" is pretty damn good. What better place is there to explore moral ambiguity, sexuality, American values and good old-fashioned mid-life crises than a plastic surgeon's office? "Nip/Tuck" is often blatantly, even unnecessarily, titillating, but just when you think the show is in danger to catering to the lowest common denominator, it all of a sudden hits you with something profound. It also helps that the show's leads are all excellent: Dylan Walsh is great as the neurotic Shawn, Joely Richardson is wonderful as the tortured Julia and Julian McMahon is terrific (as well as smokin' hot) as the vain, self-indulgent Christian. I also enjoy Roma Maffia's supporting role as Sean and Christian's tentative surgeon's nurse. My only complaint is with the casting of Sean and Julia's son Matt ... the actor is too old to be playing a sixteen year old."Nip/Tuck" is almost good enough to be considered in the same league as HBO's outstanding "The Sopranos" or "Six Feet Under" series. And maybe, just maybe, if the series continues to get better, it just might reach that level.

There are certain things you expect from a Quentin Tarantino movie: Groovy music. Pop-culture-and-expletive-filled dialogue. Reinvented iconic actors. Sexy, tough chicks. Violence. "Death Proof" doesn't fail to deliver in any of these areas.Despite its quirks, this may be Tarantino's most fun and accessible film to date. Compared to the epic "Kill Bill", it's practically breezy. Tarantino takes a bevy of attractive actresses and a loose horror plot about a maniac stuntman who gets off on killing sexy women with his car, throws in some great tunes, Kurt Russell and a spectacular, amazing car chase scene and viola ... an entertaining thrill ride. It takes a real genius like Tarantino to make it all look as easy is it does.

I saw an interview with Susan Sarandon, and she said that "Thelma and Louise isn't about feminism, it's about human liberation." I completely agree.If you put the sexual politics aside, what you have is a story of two human beings who have spent their whole lives being oppressed and controlled by other people. Louise (Sarandon) is a waitress with a tragic past and an unreliable boyfriend. Thelma is a housewife with an arrogant, controlling husband. The two decide to embark on an impromptu vacation, but while stopping for a couple of drinks at a redneck nightclub, Thelma is almost raped by a lecherous customer, and Louise shoots and kills him in the parking lot. Instead of going to the police, the two decide to skip the country and head to Mexico, but a string of unfortunate events forces the two to commit even more crimes, turning them into bona fide fugitives and outlaws.Strangely, what the two characters discover is that their new lives as outlaws are more satisfying than the stifled lives they led before. At the end of the film, the two make a choice to remain free and never surrender, despite the consequences.This film asks the question: is the only way to be free in our society to be an outlaw? The answer just might be yes.

By sheer coincidence, this is the second book in a row I have read (following "People of the Lie" by M. Scott Peck) where psychiatry and spirituality come together to bring practical insight into the human condition. In "The Art of Happiness" Howard C. Cutler, psychiatrist, conducts a series of interviews over time with the Dalai Lama in order to discuss the most universal of human interests ... how to achieve happiness.I won't begin to try to sum up the various techniques and concepts that are discussed in this book. I will say that I found reading the book to be uplifting, enjoyable and fascinating. The Dalai Lama is not a religious figure who commands respect from either intimidation or pomp and circumstance. He comes across as warm, friendly, nurturing and flexible enough to look at complex issues from various points of view, without ever resorting to defensiveness or dogma. And although Cutler's commentary is never as interesting as the Dalai Lama's own words, this book provides an excellent opportunity for the beginning of a dialogue between western psychology and eastern spirituality. Although I had read another book by the Dalai Lama a decade ago, I really consider this book to be my first real introduction to him, and I'm inspired and curious to learn more about the man and his teachings.

After the beautiful "Far From Heaven" and the dazzling "Velvet Goldmine", I was curious to see Todd Haynes' first film. Despite being made on a shoe-string budget and featuring unknown actors, "Poison" still manages to be a visually innovative, provocative and intelligent film. The film is made up of three seperate stories interwoven together. In "Hero", which takes place in the early 80's and is filmed in documentary style, a young boy kills his father, and the community tries to figure out why. In "Horror", which looks like a campy old black and white horror film, a scientist manages to turn the human sex drive into a serem, and then becomes a sexually predatory leper when he accidently drinks it. In "Homo", a man in prison in the early 20th century becomes obsessed with a fellow inmate who he watched being abused years before in a reformatory. Initially, the stories seem to have nothing in common, but the more the film goes on you start to see the connection ... they all focus on the darker side of human sexuality, and its consequences. Overall, this is an interesting first film by a terrific director who is just starting to hit his stride.

This is the first book I've ever read by Alice Walker, and I discovered it quite by accident; I picked it up randomly at a friend's house and was hooked almost from the first page. Although this book clearly has a political agenda (exposing the wretched practice of female genital mutilation), character development, story and imagination are never sacrificed just to get a point across. The main character, Tashi, is a complex, multi-layered woman whose personality is so magnetic that even her husband's mistress and their love child become infatuated with her. The novel also utilizes a non-linear storytelling format that I've seen in recent years in a lot of films, where the viewpoints of various characters throughout various points in time reveal the story piece by piece like a puzzle. While the novel explores a brutally misogynistic practice, it all feels like more of an indictment of control than of men. In fact, most of the male characters in the novel are kind, whereas the story's most obvious villain is a matriarchal wolf in sheep's clothing.

Something strange happened when I was listening to "The Eraser" for the first time. Both of the cats in my apartment came into my bedroom when they heard the music, and sat down on the floor motionless, seemingly hypnotized by it. They've never done that before. Could it be that Thom Yorke's solo album spoke to them? That the noctural, sensual, shifty, melancholy songs somehow appealed to their feline sensibility? Who knows. All I know is that I was equally as enchanted as my feline friends.

This is an interesting film, because it's partly a character study of a tired, middle aged publisher and partly a horror film about werewolves. Jack Nicholson plays a publisher about to lose his job to his friend and protege, who also happens to be sleeping with his wife. He seems too worn out to put up much of a fight, until he is bitten by a dying wolf, and begins to feel as if he has taken on its spirit. He also falls for the incredibly beautiful daughter of his boss (Michelle Pfeiffer). This movie has top notch acting, an intriuging story and a cool ending. I recommend it.

For the most part, I really liked this movie. Bobby is a terrific character: innocent, charming, open, needy and sexual. I also like the way all the relationships in this film are portrayed, because they're not at all black and white. All of the relationsihps between the main characters (Bobby and Jonathan, Bobby and Clare, Jonathan and Claire, even Bobby and Jonathan's mother) are an ambiguous combination of friendship, romance, sexual attraction and family. It was nice to see these kinds of "gray" relationships, which I've experienced often in my own life, on film.My favorite part of the film was the first "act", which showed Bobby as a child, absorbing much of his identity from his older brother, and Bobby as a teenager, befriending Jonathan and slowly being adopted by his whole family. Somehow, I preferred the younger, teenage versions of the characters to the adult versions. It's not that the older actors didn't do a good job (in fact, seeing this film gave me a newfound respect for Collin Ferrell as an actor), it's just that I found the older version of Jonathan much less appealing. I was a little disappointed that Jonathan's character ended up being a sad cliche in so many ways ... a promiscuous gay man who winds up sick from AIDS. Since so many of the relationships and ideas in this film seemed so fresh, it was sad to see one of the main characters follow such a tired path.Although I haven't read the book, I could sense from the film that there were important aspects of the plot and the characters' lives that had been cut out. Adding scenes may have made the film longer, but it probably would have improved it. Overall, however, this was an entertaining, endearing and almost great film.

Dan Savage brings the same sharp wit and practical outlook he utilizes in his syndicated sex column to "Skipping Towards Gomorrah", which explores pleasure and vice in our culture. The result is an entertaining, if somewhat lightweight, read. The structure of the book itself is a bit of a gimmick, with each of the chapters of the book being about one particular "deadly sin". This makes the book easy to read, although not particularly in depth. Dan does make some very good points (that not everybody who uses drugs recreationally is an addict, that not everyone is wired for monogamy), and it's also interesting and admirable the way he treats the "pride" chapter: as a way of criticizing, instead of glorifying, gay "pride" events. If there is an underlying theme to this book, it's "live and let live" ... and with so many public figures constantly moralizing and condemning other people, this is a philosophy our society could use a re-introduction to.

This is a beautifully crafted, powerful and resonant film. Viewers looking for a conventional action or science fiction film will be disappointed, because "Children of Men" has much more of the spirit of an art film. In fact, each scene of the film, instead of being filled with CGI, is composed like a provocative painting. (In this manner it recalls another dystopian masterpiece "A Clockwork Orange".) The story itself revolves around the theme of hope. In a future where no children are being born, human life has been reduced to a mixture of despair, violence and empty pleasure-seeking. When a pregnant woman is discovered for the first time in 18 years, she becomes both a beacon of hope and a pawn in the political agendas of various societal elements.My friends who watched this film with me didn't like the film's open, anti-climactic ending. I thought it suited the film perfectly. Bravo.

"Broken Flowers" is just the kind of film I love: It's equal parts funny and sad, intelligently written, beautifully shot, and directed by someone smart enough to get out of the way and let the outstanding actors shine. And shine they do. Once again Bill Murray, as Don Johnston, is understated, and once again it works, allowing the rest of the cast to flesh out their richly idiosyncratic characters. The journey is Don's, but the film really belongs to the actresses who play his former lovers. Don sees himself, and the world, differently through the eyes of each of these four women. The beauty lies in the subtleties: the glimpse of nudity that Laura's (Sharon Stone) daughter un-self-consciously allows Don, the desperate looks Dora (Francis Conroy) shoots to Don over dinner with her obnoxious, soulless husband, the hostility that seethes under the surface of Carmen (Jessica Lange), or Don's strangely unsurprised reaction when he's attacked by Penney's (Tilda Swinton) backwoods companions. Rich, dreamy, and bittersweet, "Broken" never looked so good.

Even if you're not a Madonna fan, if you're into electronic music, I'd highly recommend this album. The soundscapes Mirwais creates on "Production" transport you into a strange, sexy, futuristic world, at times fun and playful, at times creepy and dark. The distorted vocals, minimalist compositions and science fiction sound affects throbb with intensity, lust and yearning. This is a man who definitely has a unique and original vision.On her "Music" and "American Llife" albums, Mirwais helps Madonna take pop music to the next level, but "Production" is a true experiemental masterpiece.Highlights: Disco Science, I Can't Wait, Junkie's Prayer, Never Young Again

What I most admire about the Dalai Lama is his desire to build bridges. Where most religious leaders are divisive, he continues to try to find common ground. With this book, he attempts to build bridges between science and spirituality. While never pretending to be a scientist, he writes from the point of view of someone who's has a lifetime curiosity about science, as well as the opportunity to meet many of the greatest scientific minds in the world.Throughout the book he explores subjects such as similarities between modern physics and Buddhist principals, the role of morality in science, and the origins of consciousness and the universe. Although rudimentary, at least from a scientific standpoint (which works for me, since I have no background in science), it's all fascinating. Ultimately, The Dalai Lama makes a plea to humanity that, as we use science to alleviate physical suffering, that we try to use compassion to alleviate emotional and spiritual suffering.

It's 1996, and Prince is in love, married to his then-wife Mayte and finally free from his contract with Warner Brothers that had previously become so embittered that he took to performing with "slave" written on his face. To celebrate wedded bliss and artistic freedom, Prince released his largest collection of music ever, "Emancipation".Somewhere in this 3-disc, 36-track set lies a decent Prince album. It just happens to be hidden by a lot of bland filler (as well as the hideous art direction of the cover artwork - yuck). For every song that's a gem, there are 2 that are unremarkable and unnecessary. The tone of the whole album is soulful, upbeat and sunny, but for the most part the experimental and rebellious qualities of his earlier work are gone, leaving most of the music seeming kind of neutered. With track after track, Prince declares his love, his happiness, and his unitarian spirituality ... it's sweet, but boy does it get boring after 36 songs.My recommendation? Rip the following tracks to MP3 and create a leaner, more solid "Emancipation" album with the following songs:1. Jam of the Year2. Right Back Here in my Arms3. Courtin' Time4. Betcha By Golly Wow5. Sex in the Summer6. Curious Child7. Joint to Joint8. Slave9. The Human Body10. Sleep Around11. The Love We Make12. Emancipation

The storyline in "The Brave One" is one that is very familiar in American cinema ... a brutalized victim reclaims their power by turning into a vigilante. Because this story is so familiar, and the script of "The Brave One" is just so-so, it took a great director (Neil Jordan, "The Crying Game") and a powerhouse lead actress to elevate the film into something more than just another revenge flick.Most of the credit goes to Foster. Her performance as Erica is absolutely mesmerizing. She portrays a woman who is equal parts frightened, repelled and astounded by the avenging vigilante she finds herself becoming. Her character maintains her complex emotional landscape even when she's delivering lines like "who's the bitch now?" (While killing one of the thugs who murdered her fianc&eacute; and nearly beat her to death.)Credit also belongs to Neil Jordan, who never allows the film to descend into cheesy fare, and occasionally allows it to explore the complex emotional reactions Americans have toward revenge and vigilante violence.This is a "Hollywood" film, to be sure, with an ending that's just a little too neat and tidy to fit the messy business of revenge. But it's one of the best "Hollywood" films I've seen lately.

Chuck Palahniuk rocks. "Haunted" is Chuck at his absolute best: aggressive, anarchic, funny, disturbing, inventive, often profound and completely, totally entertaining. With "Haunted", Palahniuk takes on our human obsession with creating drama to feed our egos, and shows how disgusting, revolting and pathetic the results of such behavior are. In a way, it's like a Buddhist fairy tale. But a really, really funny one.

I had never heard of either "Suckdog" or "Rollerderby" before picking up this book, so this was really my first introduction to Lisa Carver. I found "Drugs are Nice" to be, for the most part, an engaging and entertaining memoir of a young woman living her life in an extremely bold, intuitive way. Ignoring all the rules and regulations most people allow society to impose upon them, Lisa colors outside the lines when it comes to her life, her relationships and her art. Although she makes no apologies for her life, she does constantly analyze everything she does as well as the misfit people she tends to attract and her relationships with them. Her insight is usually unique and surprisingly easy to relate to, although she sometimes comes across as self-absorbed.The story remains vital throughout most of the book, from Lisa's early years spent with her outlaw father and fellow-misfit-best-friend Rachel, to her performance-art career and marriage to a bizarre Frenchman, to the beginnings of her celebrated zine, and then finally her abusive relationship that leaves her with her special-needs son Wolfgang. Unfortunately, the end of the book tends to get bogged down by too much self-analysis. After going on Lisa's journey with her, I didn't really think it was necessary for Lisa to try to explain her behavior or justify her choices so much. She had done such a good job of taking her readers through her life that it really just wasn't necessary.

Watching "Chloe," I felt a little disappointed and misled. While the acting and directing pedigree of the film seems to indicate an intelligent and sophisticated film, the script is really little more than yet another variation on "Fatal Attraction."I've seen parts of "Natalie", the French film "Chloe" is based on, and from what I saw the film looked like a mature exploration of the disconnection of a middle-aged couple. But "Chloe" seems to reinforce so many of the tired stereotypes about sex and romance that come from American films ... most notably, the ridiculous idea that a couple who has been together for decades are still supposed to be behaving like they are in the initial infatuation stage of the relationship, and if they're not, that they've somehow "lost" something.Julianne Moore, one of modern cinema's best actresses, gives the same outstanding performance she gives in pretty much everything she's in. She plays Catherine, a gynecologist whose marriage to a professor has lost its spark over the years. (Well, duh. Juggling two successful careers and raising an almost grown son will do that to a couple.) When Catherine finds reason to suspect that her husband might have had a dalliance with a student, she makes the bizarre decision to hire a doe-eyed escort, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried, who has never looked so delicious) to try and seduce her husband and report back to her.What follows is an even more bizarre and outlandish series of events which proceed to reveal that Chloe, a young woman who clearly has "mother issues," is in fact sexually obsessed with Catherine and not, as Catherine fears, attracted to either her husband or barely legal son. Since the film never really gives the audience enough reason to believe in Chloe's feelings or actions, by the end of the film the whole thing really just becomes kind of silly.Chloe might be worth a watch for its good performances, sumptuous art direction, and sexual titillation. But it doesn't offer much intelligent insight into the subjects of relationships, sexuality, or prostitution.

Uh ... yeah. So amazon wouldn't publish the review I previously wrote for this album. I'm guessing it was because I criticized other artists who I feel have lost their touch.Queer music is a genre all its own. The artist making the music doesn't even have to be gay (even though it helps). It's about creating music with a certain celebratory, joyful, tongue-in-cheek, dramatic, and, for lack of a better word, fabulous feel to it. This album qualifies on all counts. And the icing on the cake is that, musically, it's really very good. Good vocals, good lyrics, good songs, good production. It's just really fun.Plus they actually mention "skeksis" in the song "Return to Oz." How cool is that?

Irreversible is an experimental, disturbing, challenging, and provocative piece of filmmaking. If you have the stomach for it, it's definitely worth a watch. The fact that the entire film is in reverse, with each scene shown actually occuring earlier in time than the last scene shown, means that it's really impossible to understand everything that's happening in each scene until you've seen the entire film. Once the entire thing is done, it all makes more sense.The film really follows life's tendency to start with innocence and, as the result of brutality, lead down a dark path of depravity. Instead of starting with the innocence lost, the film begins with the resulted depravity; the two main male characters, Marcus and Pierre, seek revenge against a man they are looking for in a seedy S&M; club. The beginning of the film is an orgy of rage, dark sexuality, and gory violence. As the film progresses, it's revealed that the two are seeking revenge for the brutal rape of their friend and girlfriend Alex. The notorious tunnel rape scene, although horrible to watch, marks the dividing point in the film, and the rest of the film depicts the characters before their lives were destroyed by the senseless violence of the rape.Before/after the rape, the film is really sort of about a love triangle between the three main characters. Alex has left one man (mature, responsible, cerebral Pierre) for another (self-assured, visceral, immature Marcus). However, the three remain friendly, and have candid discussions about why Alex is more drawn to Marcus despite his immaturity. The film's final/first scene disspels any doubt, with Alex and Marcus laying together naked, playful and innocent, a metaphorical Adam and Eve, and since the audience knows the horror and brutality that await them, it makes it all the more devastating.

30-year-old Justine is drowning in inertia. Her dead-end job at "the Retail Rodeo" and her stoner husband make up her humdrum existence, and it's slowly driving her crazy. So when surly 22-year-old Holden (who renamed himself after the main character from "Catcher in the Rye") becomes Justine's new co-worker, she sees an opportunity to bond with a kindred spirit. "You hate the world," she tells him. "I hate it, too." The two embark on a passionate affair, but quickly Justine finds herself in over her head."The Good Girl" is a terrific drama about a woman at a crossroads in her life. Justine hates the predictability of her uninspired life, but she's also terrified to take a leap into the unknown. I think there are very few people who can't relate to her situation. Jennifer Aniston is remarkable in the role of Justine, shedding all the obvious charm and cuteness of her "Friends" persona to inhabit a character that is heartbreakingly ordinary.

"Intimacy", a film about two middle-aged people, Jay and Claire, who meet for sex every wednesday, is difficult to digest as a whole. It's as if the film needs to be divided into two distinct sections: the scripted melodrama and the graphic sex scenes.Let's start with the scripted scenes. In terms of the script and story, "Intimacy" is pretty mediocre. The main characters, although confused, neurotic, trapped and lonely, are still really not all that interesting or believable, and the supporting characters are mostly irritating and often incoherent. It is interesting that the most believable, touching and tender scenes in the film don't involve the two main characters at all, but rather involve interactions between adults and children. One scene in particular is especially poignant; when Jay is at the theatre, confronting and chastising Claire, when suddenly her son appears and he's instantly transformed into a sincere and vulnerable father again.As for the sex scenes ... with so many films filled with contrived, choreographed, robotic sexuality, it was interesting to see sex depicted so realistically in a film. At times visceral, awkward, vulnerable and sad, the brief sex scenes probably show more of the dynamics behind Jay and Claire's relationship than most of the rambling, pretentious dialogue in the rest of the film.

Kelis is one of the most exciting new R&B singers I've heard in a long time. I've been a fan since her very good debut "Kaleidoscope" a few years ago, and never understood why her excellent "Wanderland" CD was never released in the US. "Tasty" is her most provocative and erotic release yet, showcasing a confident young woman not afraid to either explore her sexuality or experiment with her sound. A few highlights include the funky opening track "Trick Me", the entrancing single "Milkshake", the explicit "In Public" (featuring her fiance Nas) and the trippy "Millionaire" (a duet with Outkast's Andrew 3000). This CD is funky, soulful, spacey, and very sexy.

&quot;Enough&quot; is nothing more than a Lifetime original movie masquerading as a big screen drama. Instead of exploring the complicated and tragic dynamics behind an abusive marriage, &quot;Enough&quot; simply creates a cartoonishly evil villian and a damsel in distress for the audience to root for. Charismatic Jennifer Lopez, talented Juliette Lewis, and dashing Billy Campbell all deserve better material.

What I like about this film is probably what so many other people don't like about it - its refusal to moralize, and its refusal to offer pat answers to why the characters behave as they do.Michelle Williams (a fascinating actress who projects both childlike innocence and wisdom beyond her years at the same time) plays Margot, a 28-year-old housewife who falls in love with the aspiring artist who lives across the street. Margot at first tries to resist the obvious attraction between the two of them, but as with so many forbidden romances, their coupling seems almost unavoidable. Many films have been made about infidelity, but "Take This Waltz" comes across as unique and fresh.Part of this has to do with Margot's relationship with her husband, Lou (Seth Rogan), which doesn't seem like the kind of relationship a woman would want to run from. Margot and Lou have a fairly happy life together, and the two communicate together as real couples do - in a unique, shared language that's been created over years. Lou is sweet natured, has a loving family, and is working hard on publishing his cookbook. It's Margot who seems lost. She mentions a desire for a writing career but seems to have little motivation. Beyond physical chemistry, her attraction to Daniel (Luke Kirby) makes sense - the two share artistic aspirations but lack the motivation to commit to them.The story of passion, attraction, infidelity and betrayal is softened by the film's tone, which is almost always whimsical and fanciful. Set in Toronto, everything that surrounds the characters - the houses, the decor, the clothing - is saturated with a bright, almost childlike color palate. Only one character in the film seems to stand out from the cuteness of it all - Lou's sister, Geraldine, played by Sarah Silverman. The character, an alcoholic struggling with sobriety, seems to offer the film and its characters their only jolt of harsh reality. When she lashes out at Margot in a drunken rage, it's ironically the most sober moment in the film. She accuses Margot of using a new romance the same way she uses alcohol - as a quick, but ultimately unsatisfying fix to temporarily fill the emptiness that is a natural part of life.The film asks a difficult question: if all relationships, even happy ones, lose their freshness and excitement over time, how do you know whether it's better to stick it out or part ways? Even the ending of the film offers no clear cut answer as to whether Margot's decisions have worked out for the best.

"The Tudors" is a highly entertaining, decadent, sumptuous, R-rated soap opera. As you can tell right from the sudsy opening credits, this is not a "period piece" like you would see on the BBC or in a Merchant & Ivory film. Despite its setting in 16th century England, it really has more in common with other modern cable dramas. It uses the setting of the Court of Henry VIII as a way to explore the relationships between politics, religion, sex, power and overindulgence.Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Henry VIII as an unapologetic alpha male who truly seems to feel that the world around him is obliged to indulge his every whim and desire. Excessive, melodramatic, impulsive and passionate, the smartest and most cunning people around him use flattery and subtle manipulation in order to follow through with their own agendas. Some of the characters who inhabit the first season include his best friend Charles, who uses his position to live like a promiscuous rock star, Cardinal Wolsey, who runs Henry's political affairs while positioning himself to be Pope, Ann Boleyn, who seduces Henry as a calculated move to gain power and position for her family, and Henry's wife Queen Katherine, who, although dignified and virtuous, will not gotten out of the way easily.I've never studied the actual history of Henry VIII, so I really can't speak to the historical accuracy of the show. I can say that the show seems to be speaking as much about modern politics through its storylines as the issues of the day. The show is at its best when the characters have to face the consequences for their opportunistic, self-indulgent behavior, and at it's work when, like so many other cable dramas, it feels the need for excessive use of simulated, soft-core porn style sex scenes.

Along with "United States of Tara" and "Dexter", with "Nurse Jackie" Showtime shows why it is quickly eclipsing HBO as the cable network with the best original programming.I've never really been a fan of medical dramas, but "Nurse Jackie" is good stuff. The titular character, played to perfection by dynamite Edie Falco (completing shedding Carmela Soprano as effectively as Michael C. Hall shed David Fischer), is a character unlike we've ever seen on TV. She's not a virtuous heroine, she's not a villianess, and she's not really an anti-heroine either. She's actually mostly like a real person. She's so full of contradictions, virtues, and vices that she really seems less like a character and more like someone you know. And what's great is that the show doesn't try to give pat answers as to why Jackie is the way she is ... why she's a tough, compassionate caregiver and mother who also happens to be an adulterous opiate addict.While Nurse Jackie and Edie Falco are superb, the rest of the characters are merely good, which is why this is a four star and not a five star review. Some of the characters shine (brainiac idiot Dr. Cooper and doe-eyed Zoe)whereas others still seem 2-dimensional or stereotypical (Miss Akalitus and Mo, the token gay nurse). Still, with only one season under the show's belt, even the less developed characters have plenty of time to find their place in this mostly fresh, funny, and unpredictable series.

What is it about the Canadians? They just seem to have a knack for droll, subversive humor, which is my favorite kind. "Mr. Show" is tied with "The Kids in the Hall" (another Canadian brainchild) for my favorite sketch comedy show of all time."Stream of consciousness" is the phrase that comes up often when people are talking about the show, and it's understandable. The skits don't ever really end, they just flow into one another, like some kind of comedic dream. The show is so non-linear and unpredictable that you're constantly amazed, confused and shocked by the places it's willing to go. But to just write it all off as obtuse would be a mistake, because underneath all the insanity are plenty of subversive and right-on political messages. One of my favorites is the advertisements for various "Globo-Chem" products, a giant corporation whose commercials go out of their way to insult and offend you, and then proclaim, with their tagline, "Take it from me ... I love you!"

Somewhere inside the twisted, spectacular mess of "Southland Tales" is a decent film. Perhaps all that's necessary is a good editor to bring out the film that was clearly intended; one that's an over-the-top satire of 21st century life. In this world, porn stars, terrorists, politicians, cops, and A-list Hollywood actors often cross paths and form alliances on their way to fulfilling their various narcissistic agendas. They roam around, self-absorbed and self-unaware, grasping toward whatever decadent trinkets tickle their fancy, while the world is literally about to end.Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the entire thing just became muddled and incomprehensible. Which is a shame, because with the writer/director of Donnie Darko at the helm and a slew of varied talent in the film, it really could have been something great.

This is the third film I've seen by Bobcat Golthwait (after "Sleeping Dogs Lie" and "World's Greatest Dad"), and he's really emerged as an interesting filmmaker. So far, all his films seem to have a similar formula: take an outrageous premise, and then use it to explore the human condition in surprisingly nuanced ways.Frank (Joel Murray, in a sensitive leading performance) has had it. His cold ex-wife has left him for a younger man, and is spoiling their bratty daughter. He's fired from him job for sexual harassment, when all he did was send flowers to a co-worker to cheer her up. And finally, his horrifically indifferent doctor diagnoses him with a terminal brain tumor. Frank is also disgusted with current American culture. He sits in his living room, flipping channels, and is horrified by how dumbed down and mean-spirited everything is. Finally, while watching a show that features a monstrous, entitled girl planning a garish Sweet 16 party, Frank snaps, and decides to track the girl down and murder her.While committing the murder, Frank meets teenage Roxy, who is thrilled and impressed by the execution. Roxy tracks Frank down at this motel room, right before his planned suicide, and encourages him to turn the incident from a final act of rage to the beginning of a murder spree meant to rid the world of the worst of society. Despite their age difference, Frank and Roxy bond. They're both angry, lonely and disturbed. Their relationship explores the similarities between adolescent disillusionment and middle-aged disillusionment, and discovers they're really not so different. Roxy approaches their crime spree with more excitement and enthusiasm, perhaps, than world-weary Frank, who approaches the whole thing from the perspective of a has-been who has nothing left to lose. But really, they're kindred spirits.The two then go on a quest to rid society of many of its biggest cultural tumors, and various characters serve as stand-ins for real life institutions such as American Idol, Fox News, and the Westboro Baptist Church. Frank and Roxy also occasionally execute everyday people who are just plain rude and nasty, including people who talk on the phone in the movie theatre, or people who take up two spaces with their car.It's all very entertaining and darkly funny. Yet often throughout the film, when Frank is glued to the TV in disgust, I find myself asking a question: why can't he just turn it off? Instead of all his reactive ranting, why can't he just go for a hike, or read a book, or listen to an album by someone who actually has talent? So as much as the film justifiably criticizes much of the cultural wasteland, it doesn't let the viewer off the hook either. Why do we continue to watch awful TV shows and movies, listen to awful music, and give attention to vapid, narcissistic people? Why don't we only support artists and products that are worth supporting? And if we're finding our culture has become petty and cruel, why don't we counteract it by treating the people around us with kindness and respect?

So, Nikka Costa can sing. As in "Kelly Clarkson and X-Tina eat your hearts out" sing. She emotes, she wails, she occasionally shrieks, she pours herself into every note. She's funky, she's soulful, she's sexy, and she takes no prisoners. Although she does melancholy well, I like her best when she's joyful, which is why "Around the World", "Happy in the Morning", and the exuberant opener "Till I Get To You" are my favorite tracks. I'm smiling. My ass is shakin'. I'm feelin' you, Ms. Costa.

"Love is dumb." utters the main character of "Romance", Marie, in her voiceover narrative that comes and goes throughout the film. "It's just a power trip." This line could probably be used to sum up the whole theme of this film, which serves as a surreal metaphor for modern romantic relationships.This film hypothesizes that, during initial courtship, men have all the power in a relationship. They have a constant need to chase and conquer (to paraphrase a line spoken by Marie's vain boyfriend Paul), which opposes a woman's need to attach and commit. Once the initial chase has ended, the man loses interest. The result is that the woman finds herself degraded. And yet, when pregnancy enters the picture, the balance of power changes. In the film, Marie's boyfriend is literally destroyed at the moment she conceives his child. Is this the woman's ultimate revenege ... when her love for her child eclipses her love for the man in her life, maybe even making him irrelevant? It's certainly something to think about.

I heard Goldfrapp's slinky, electro-sexfest album "Black Cherry" first, fell madly in love with it, and absolutely had to hear their first album immediately afterward. When I did, I was in for a (pleasant) surprise ... "Felt Mountain" sounds completely different from "Black Cherry", and yet it's equally as brilliant. Subtler, dreamier, less overt and yet just as sonically adventurous, Ms. Goldfrapp is less a space-age sex goddess here than she is a sultry fairy godmother. The songs on "Felt Mountain" transport you into a strange, cinematic underworld that you never want to leave.When is Goldfrapp's next album coming out? I want more!

This is one of the rare occasions where I think this movie was actually better than the book. Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue bring a depth and vulnerability to their film characters that the more detached characters in the book seemed to lack. The result is a heartbreaking story about two people who, while hitting rock bottom, find true love. Ben, a suicidal alcoholic, and Sera, a prostitute, are the kind of people that the rest of the world likes to sweep under the rug. So since neither character has any pretense, any ego, or anything really to lose, they are able to come together and love each other in a sincere and unconditional way. The result is that the film, although incredibly sad, is also strangely inspiring.

I'm only 28, and yet I still really enjoyed and appreciated this film. Why? Because it's the first romantic comedy I've seen in a long time that I didn't find to be a complete insult to my intelligence. On a surface level, this film is about an aging playboy who's spent his life chasing youth and beauty, who inadvertently falls for the middle-aged, successful yet lonely mother of his current trophy girlfriend. However, beyond that premise, this film has lots to say about intimacy, romance, loneliness and love that I think people of any age can relate to. The script isn't perfect, but it is genuinely clever, thoughtful, and touching. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, both screen icons, give fantastic performances that carry the film. Diane Keaton is especially excellent: she has an amazing ability to display several complex emotions at once. All you need to do is look at her face to know exactly what her character is thinking and feeling. Overall, a smart and insightful comedy.

Nelly Furtado's second album, Folklore, shows tremendous growth from her debut album, which I thought was good in the first place. The sound of Folklore is much more fleshed out, with each track filled with world beats, acoustic instruments and just a hint of electronica (which was much more prevalent in her debut). This production suits Nelly's voice much better than the sparser material, and the result is that her voice sounds fantastic. Lyrically, marriage and motherhood have clearly inspired Nelly, because the lyrics, songwriting and delivery are all much more emotional and passionate. I once saw an interview with Nelly, and she said she wanted to be a "career artist". I believe she has the talent to be making great music for a long time.

I actually owned this book for years before getting around to reading it, and then when I finally did I was kicking myself for not reading it sooner. &quot;A Spy in the House of Love&quot; is the story of a young woman named Sabina who, despite having a kind and loving husband, engages in adulterous affairs with men she barely knows. What is it that motivates Sabina? Is it a thirst for adventure? Lust? Resentment towards her husband or the roles society imposes on her? Instead of being a trite morality tale where the &quot;sinner&quot; is punished by facing horrible consequences (like the recent film &quot;Unfaithful&quot;) this book explores, without judgement, Sabina's conflicted emotions and motives.

In "My Loose Thread", Dennis Cooper creates one of the most disturbed, fascinating and realistic characters I've ever seen in fiction. The main character, Larry, is much more than your average troubled, misguided youth. He is truly psychotic, and on the brink of a major meltdown with horrifying consequences.The death of his friend Rand, who dies of natural causes after Larry punches him, starts Larry on a downward spiral. He gets absolutely no help from his alcoholic mother or his cancer-stricken father, and even his detached, condescending psychiatrist fails to help him. Larry eventually finds himself involved in a murder plot instigated by a wannabe skinhead named Gilman, and that's when everything starts escalating into a true bloodbath.After the Columbine tragedy, there was a lot of fingerpointing going on, but I've seen few people really dare to try to get inside the head of a young person disturbed enough to turn to such extreme violence. Dennis Cooper, as usual, dares to explore the dark corners of the human psyche that most of us are too afraid to venture into.

Mary J. Blige has a fantastic singing voice. And since the pop music scene is filled with photogenic sexpots who can barely carry a tune, that would probably be enough. But Mary also has a knack for pouring her personal experiences, struggles, and emotions into her lyrics and music, and that's what her fans really respond to. &quot;No More Drama&quot; is more than just the title of this album and it's centerpiece song ... it's a manifesto. On this CD, Mary is putting her old troubles and demons behind her, and opening a new chapter in her life: one which focuses on growth and spirituality. Mary deserves the title &quot;The Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot;, because she rules.

I haven't read the book this film was based on, so I can only judge it on its own merits. I thought it was very good. All the performances are excellent, especially Alison Lohman's, who, as the main character Astrid, carries the film with a subtle and mature performance. Michelle Pfeiffer, however, steals every scene she's in with her portrayal of Astrid's manipulative and vicious mother. Robin Wright Penn, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger and Patrick Fugit all do a good job portraying the characters Astrid meets while navigating through the foster care system. The film could easily have been cheesy and melodramatic, but the script and direction keep it grounded in reality, which makes Astrid's story all the more riveting.

Nikka Costa can sing. I mean, really SING. And unlike Christina Aguilera, she not only has amazing pipes, but she sings from the heart instead of from her ego. Aside from her great voice, this CD also boasts terrific songwriting and great production. &quot;Like a Feather&quot; and &quot;Everybody Got Their Something&quot; both have an old school R&amp;B sound with inspiring, even spiritual, lyrics. &quot;Tug of War&quot; and &quot;Hope it Felt Good&quot; have Nikki wailing over a noisier rock sound, while &quot;Push &amp; Pull&quot; and &quot;Nothing&quot; showcase her more somber side. The only reason I'm giving this album four stars instead of five is that I'm hoping her future releases will be even better. I can't wait to hear more from this gifted artist.

"Melancholia" may be the most accessible Lars Von Trier film I've ever seen. (However, for a director who often goes out of his way to alienate, repulse, and irritate his audience, that is not saying much.) "Melancholia" is beautifully shot and visually lovely to look at; gone is the difficult visual minimalism of films like "Dogville". Also gone is the gory brutality that is often part of Von Trier's films (especially his last film, "Antichrist".) "Melancholia" is a thoughtful, fascinating film told in two distinct, yet overlapping, parts.The first part, "Justine", is a realistic, sad family drama which tells the story of a young bride who implodes on her wedding day. Just married to a handsome man, promoted by her boss, and treated to a lavish party by her rich brother-in-law, Justine has every reason to be happy. Except she's not. Behind her forced smile, she's hiding a dark depression. By the end of the night Justine's depression, along with the selfishness and dysfunction of those around her, cause her to destroy both her brand new marriage and her career, and spiral into a dramatic depressive breakdown. Von Trier seems to have a deep interest in female protagonists who are being crushed by the expectations of those around them. In films like "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark", the characters were treated to sordid and gruesome abuse, but in the first half of "Melancholia", Justine is a more or less ordinary person suffering in a more conventional and relatable way.The second part of the film, "Claire", puts the focus on Justine's older sister. Claire is concerned about the reports in the news that a previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, will be passing close to the Earth's orbit. While most scientists believe that the planet will pass at a safe distance, there are those who also believe that an imminent collision will mean the end of the world. Claire's anxiety about the situation builds as the planet comes closer. Claire is also dealing with her sister's (Justine) post-wedding nervous breakdown. As the planet grows ever closer to Earth, the tension builds, until the characters are left to deal with the very real possibility that the world is going to end.By splitting the film up into two parts in this way, "Melancholia" explores the themes of loss, destruction, impermanence, and loneliness, first on an intimate scale ("Justine") and then on a global scale ("Claire"). Although the film is provocative and often painful, it's more subtle and nuanced than any of Von Trier's other films I've seen, and perhaps more affective.

It can't be easy to make a film about the fast food industry without coming across as preachy or judgmental, but "Fast Food Nation" does just that. The film does a good job of showcasing a diverse array of characters who are involved in the fast food industry on a variety of levels; from high school student cashiers, to an upper level marketing executive, to illegal immigrants working in the meat packing plant. It helps that an impressive level of acting talent was engaged for the film (including Patricia Arquette, Bruce Willis, Greg Kinnear, and Wilmer Valderrama, who is somehow far less annoying when he's speaking in Spanish), and the talent all helps to flesh out characters that could easily have come across as two dimensional. Each character, although superficially different, is each depicted as a person doing their best to survive in society, despite their reservations about their job or the industry they work in. Is there anyone who can't relate to that?

Alan Ball's heavy, worldly, realisitic material (Six Feet Under, Amercan Beauty) always had elements of fun, fantasy, and sexuality. So what would happen if Ball took on a show based on a series of southern gothic fantasy-romance-horror novels?True Blood is a freakin blast. It's fun, it's sexy, it's thrilling, it's over-the-top, it's engrossing, and totally addictive. By increasing the roles of the supporting characters in Charlaine Harris' equally addictive novels, Ball has managed to create an true ensemble show which combines the sexy and supernatural with Ball's trademark depth and social commentary.Obviously creative liberties needed to be taken in order to turn the books into a series, but I doubt Charlaine Harris is irked. This show could have easily been a cheese-tastic CW mess, but with Oscar-winning Anna Paquin playing Sookie Stackhouse, Ball at the helm, and quality-driven HBO as the host, I don't see how the series could have possibly turned out better.

***1/2The third film in the "Bourne" series finds itself descending a little bit into redundancy. While the first film found Jason Bourne, amnesiac assassin, reclaiming his humanity while trying to find his identity and the second film found the character beginning to make amends while facing the consequences for his past, Jason Bourne seems to be on auto-pilot in "The Bourne Ultimatum." The character's motives seem unclear ... although his goal is still to get to the source of his past and condition, he doesn't seem sure what he intends to do when he does. Is he looking for redemption or just revenge?As with the first two films, the action, acting and direction are all top-notch. It's just that the subplots don't ever really go anywhere. The supporting characters are all intriguing, but they're not really given much to do. Julia Stiles' character never gets to reveal her history with Bourne, and an interesting scene that finds her cutting and dying her hair, mirroring the scene with Marie from the first film, is never fully developed. The subplot of the corrupt CIA agents setting up Pam (Joan Allen's character) to take the fall for the entire Treadstone program is also introduced and then never really fleshed out. The film repeatedly chooses long chase scenes instead of character development.Also frustrating is how little about Bourne's past is actually revealed in the film. Although Bourne claims at one point "I remember everything", the viewer really gets to know very little of it. After three films, the audience deserves a bigger payback for their investment.

Why Kelis' fresh and funky sophomore CD "Wanderland" was never released in the US, I will never know. This is a terrific pop/R&B; CD. Although the Neptunes have produced mediocre tracks for the likes of Britney Spears, they really seem to have a great chemistry with Kelis, and together they deliver plenty of spacey, throbbing grooves. The CD opens with "Young, Fresh 'n New", a pop anthem about freeing yourself from society's restrictions. "Flashback", which is also included in Kelis' new "Tasty" CD, is a sexy groove which has Kelis cooing "Ooh, you make my body go ... yeah, yeah!" It's adorable. Other highlights are "Perfect Day", which features an explosion of hard-rock guitars, "Get Even", where we find Kelis seething with anger towards the girl who stole her man, and the hidden track "I Don't Care Anymore", another "be true to yourself" anthem.Here's hoping that Kelis' new CD finally gets her the attention she deserves.

Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci are two of my favorite screen actors. They're both quirky iconoclasts who occasionally make studio films, but always seem to really shine in offbeat, smaller pictures. The relationship between their two characters, Lazarus and Rae, is the heart and focus of this film. Both characters have been wounded by sex in ways that strangely complement one another: Lazarus has been betrayed by his cold, promiscuous wife, and Rae's history of sexual abuse has brought about her character's uncontrollable sexual compulsion.Lazarus and Rae meet when Rae is beaten and left unconscious by the side of the road after humiliating one of the many suitors who take advantage of her compulsive promiscuity. Lazarus nurses her back to health, and then feels a self-righteous desire to "cure" her of her "illness", however, it is clear that he is trying to save himself somehow as much as he is trying to save her.As much as Ricci and Jackson carry the film, a lot of credit is also owed to the soundtrack. The blues music wonderfully complements the emotions and circumstances of the two tormented characters. The songs speaks of sex, betrayal, sadness and redemption; the perfect musical complement to the themes of the film.

Bjork, like Madonna, is one of the rare artists who really makes the most of the music video medium. Instead of creating disposable promos, Bjork's videos are performance art pieces, as captivating and experimental as anything you might see in an art gallery. She has a knack for teaming with wonderful directors who share her vision and pioneering spirit. Some highlights of this stunning collection include "Human Behavior" (a playful, surreal fairy tale by Michael Gondry), It's Oh So Quiet (a post-modern musical extravaganza by Spike Jones), "I Miss You" (an animated wonderland by the artists behind Ren &amp; Stimpy) and "All Is Full of Love" (a cybersexual saga by Chris Cunningham). This collection is a must-have for any true Bjork fan.

There is sort of a whole new sub-genre of films that have come out in recent years. It's hard to put an easy label on them, but they all involve creepy, scary stories about protagonists who are most likely insane, and as a result, the films have an ambiguity regarding what is actually real and what is just taking place in the protagonist's troubled head. Recent films such as "The Machinist", "Secret Window", "Shutter Island", and even "Black Swan" might all be put in this category, as well as this film, "Heartless"."Heartless" is the story of a young photographer, Jamie, who has large birthmarks on his body, including a large one on his face, and as a result is withdrawn and introverted. His life mostly involves his close-knit family, including his religious mother, more confident older brother, and wayward nephew, all of whom live in a dangerous area of London. Tragically, a group of terrorist gang members performing random acts of brutality murder his mother, which sends him on a mental breakdown after which it's difficult to tell what is real and what is not. What follows is a supernatural plot in which Jamie meets the devil and makes a deal with him to remove his birthmarks in exchange for Jamie performing a random act of chaos. Being the devil and all, he lies and tells Jamie that this act will simply involve some vandalism, but in actuality Jamie is forced to commit a brutal murder himself.Sound confusing? It is. The labyrinthine plot is full of strange, bizarre, and disturbing twists and turns. And the tone of the film constantly shifts - at times between horror, dark comedy, fantasy, and social commentary. Perhaps that's because the film clearly owes its existence to a variety of influences: Watching "Heartless", you can't help but see shades of the Matrix Trilogy, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg.Despite its somewhat muddled plot, what saves the film is the imagery. Visually, the film's themes include reptilian predators and urban decay. The terrorist street gang, who look like lizard demons, are genuinely very scary, as is the Devil, who appears as a heavily scarred middle-aged thug with a deformed, claw-like hand.So as a horror-fantasy, the film works, as it provides some genuinely frightening moments and inspired visuals. But when the film tries too hard at pretentious, arm-chair philosophy, that's when it stumbles.

Charles Bukowski is one of my favorite writers. After seeing "Barfly" and now "Factotum", I've come to the conclusion that perhaps his work just doesn't translate well to film. Charles Bukowski rarely wrote about anything other than his own life, partly because he was self-absorbed, but also because he probably knew that he was such a fascinating character. Underneath all his crude, self-destructive behavior was clearly a sensitive man who found the phoniness of modern society completely unbearable. As a result, he preferred the company of people on the fringes of society because, for all their flaws, they were at least real and honest.Like "Barfly", "Factotum" is not a poor film by any means. But I don't think it really captures all of the comedy and tragedy of Bukowski's novel. What makes it worth watching are the performances ... I prefer Matt Dillon's subtle performance in "Factotum" to the more mannered performance Mickey Rourke gave in "Barfly". Lili Taylor is also wonderful as Henry's (aka Charles) volatile, hard-living girlfriend. Marisa Tomei makes a brief appearance playing what I believe to be the same character Faye Dunaway did in "Barfly". Tomei plays the character as more dazed than hostile.Glancing at some of the other reviews, characters portrayed in this film seem to evoke a lot of harsh judgment from people, not unlike the same judgment Henry gets from his own father in one of the film's best scenes. If you are able to maintain a curiosity and sympathy for people who live on the fringes of society, than this film is worth a look. And you should DEFINITELY check out Bukowski's novels and stories.

After Dexter's first excellent season, I wondered if the show could possibly continue the fascinating, thrilling momentum of the series while offering up new storylines. But the second season starts off with a bang when Dexter's underwater graveyard of victims is discovered, and all of a sudden the Miami PD and FBI are all hot on the trails of a new serial killer ... him. Dexter's manueverings to avoid being caught occupy much of the season's plotlines, but the rest of his energies are focused on the women in his life. While sister Deb and Rita both find themselves growing out of their roles as victims and taking more control of their lives, Dexter becomes involved with a dark, dangerous woman named Lila. Once again, Dexter finds himself torn between a his deceitful "normal" relationships and a more authentic, yet completely destructive one.All in all the show delivers a second stellar season, and I'm left wondering ... what can they possibly do next?

The storyline of "The Elementary Particles" is really fairly simple: two half-brothers (one a sex-obsessed, self-loathing teacher, and the other a distant, emotionally detached scientist) find redemptive, middle-aged romance, lose it, and then meet their fates. However, there's a LOT going on in this book. While recounting the stories of half-brothers Bruno and Michel, the author bombards the reader with ideas; about science, sex, family, religion, philosophy, sociology and the human condition. Yet somehow the books remains an engaging and enjoyable read, never seeming dry or pretentious.Michel Houellebecq is my new favorite writer. I'd also recommend the political sex-fest of "Platform".

"Wanted" provoked a question in me: how could a movie so fundamentally hollow be so much fun to watch?There's no doubt about it ... "Wanted" is fun. First of all, it employs a serious arsenal of mega-watt talent: Charming and adorable James McAvoy, the always-seductive Angelina Jolie back in sexy bad-ass mode, and the reassuring and paternal Morgan Freeman. Second, it's full of state-of-the-art action and special affects, which has caused the (unwarranted, sadly) comparisons to the original "Matrix" film. And third, there is an entertaining (but forgettable) storyline involving assassins and a secret society.Once you get past all the sexy fun, the film is, sadly, hollow. The central premise of the film seems to be that working in an office makes you a sad loser. When we're living in a time when unemployment is in the double digits and people with college degrees are flipping burgers to make ends meet, this is an insulting thesis. The film also proposes that violence = empowerment. The central character, after being trained to be an assassin, becomes self-assured and sexy. In her supporting role, Angelina Jolie provides the film's true emotional core ... beneath her character's confidence and sex appeal, she's a broken-hearted, lost soul.

This movie is wonderful. It manages to be both stylistically daring and genuinely touching. Harvey Pekar is such a fantastic protagonist because he's so heartbreakingly ordinary. Lonely, overwhelmed, unlucky in love and stuck in a dead-end job, Harvey decides to turn his humdrum life into a comic book, and ends up becoming a cultural icon that ordinary people everywhere can relate to. His romance and marriage to Joyce is one of the most touching and heartwarming screen romances I've seen in a long time. And when Harvey inadvertently becomes a television celebrity by becoming a regular on the David Letterman Show, he quickly finds himself disgusted by the whole charade and sabotages it (the scene with Pekar having a disturbing on-air argument with Letterman is one of the most intense scenes in the film). The film brilliantly combines the fictionalized story of Harvey, portrayed by actors, with real footage of the people being portrayed, as well as animation inspired by the comic book. In the process, the ordinary people portrayed become fascinating, hilarious and endearing.

Ridley Scott's "Prometheus" is the yin to "Avatar's" yang. Both are high-budget, visually stunning sci-fi films. But while James Cameron's "Avatar" was a crowd-pleasing affair, creating a vibrant, almost psychedelic world, "Prometheus" is a somber, cerebral and ambiguous piece of filmmaking.Two archaeologists, Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave paintings around the world, all from different civilizations and eras, which point to a moon far away in space which has the ability to support life. The two are convinced that the creators of human life (or "Engineers" as they refer to them) are from there, and that the paintings are an actual invitation to visit. They find a corporate sponsor (Wayland Corp.) willing to bankroll a trillion-dollar space mission to the faraway moon to investigate (although it's clear from the beginning that they have their own motives beyond just the archeologists' fantasy of meeting humanity's creators). So off Elizabeth and Charlie go, along with an entire crew which includes android David (a spellbinding Michael Fassbender) and Wayland Corp. administrator (an icy Charlize Theron).And so it begins. Anyone who's seen any of the "Alien" films will have no doubt that the crew is not, sadly, going to be meeting up with a benevolent, advanced civilization that created humanity and welcomes them with open arms. The film is called "Prometheus," which refers to a Greek myth about a god who is punished for helping humanity by being forced to have his liver eaten, and then regenerate in order to relive the ordeal day after day. In my opinion, the myth of "Oedipus" would be just as fitting a reference for this film; Oedipus' fatal flaw, his relentless need to learn the truth, is what caused his downfall and suffering. Similarly, the main characters in the film mostly share a need to find the origin and meaning behind human life, and suffer greatly for it."Don't we all want to see our parents die?" asks David at one point, which is a strange question coming from an android who doesn't actually have parents per se. But the film explores, on many levels, the oftentimes antagonistic relationship between parent/child and creator/creation.

I don't think I've ever seen a film that depicts teenagers so realistically, particularly misguided, troubled ones. Most films or television shows portray teenagers as either miniature adults or as tired stereotypes, but this film does neither. In "Bully", the young characters are restless, awkward, rebellious, sexual, insecure and volatile. They constantly feel the need to perpetuate a fierce bravado to compensate for their fear and vulnerability. Although I was fortunate enough never to be involved in anything as horrific as the characters in this film while in my teens, I could see my younger self, friends and acquaintances in all of the characters, which made it all the more disturbing when their actions turned violent and tragic. This is a brave, unsettling, and startlingly realistic film.

When I first heard "Move Your Feet", I was enthralled. It reminded me of vintage Michael Jackson. When I saw it being performed by two Danish white guys - one heavyset and gay, the other skinny and straight - I was delighted. The rest of the album is equally delightful. Junior Senior's philosophy seems to be that anything goes in the name of fun. Musically, their influences seem to be everything but the kitchen sink: punk, pop, R&B, dance, new wave ... the list goes on and on. Lyrically, they seem to be more single-minded. Most of the songs are about sex and partying. My favorite tracks are "Chicks and D***s", where Junior and Senior compare their respective sexual preferences, and "White Trash", which is about the joys of being, well, white trash. I want these guys to be at every party I go to ...

"Wristcutters" is a movie about people who are all stuck in a sort of limbo populated by people who have committed suicide. The main character, Zia (The adorably sincere Patrick Fugit) is surprised to find that life after suicide is even more bleak than life before. Mostly, the people who inhabit this limbo just hang out, drink, work at menial jobs, and wander around in a daze. It's only when Zia discovers that his girlfriend, whose rejection drove him to suicide in the first place, also killed herself and is inhabiting the same world, that he decides to embark on a road trip to find her.For such morose subject matter, the film isn't really very heavy at all. It's more strange, surreal, and comic. The film is filled with odd, imaginative touches (like the black hole that exists at the bottom of the junkheap car Zia travels in). And although the film occassionally flirts with social commentary, at it's heart it's really a romantic comedy. Although Zia sets out to reconnect with his pre-suicide girlfriend, he finds himself falling for the hitchhiker (Shannyn Sossamon) that he and his Russian musician friend pick up on their travels. (By the way, it's nice to see Shannyn Sossamon again in a decent movie. She's a beautiful actress and I haven't seen her in anything other than horror trash since "The Rules of Attraction.")"Wristcutters" fails to fall into any of the traps that it could have (pretentiousness, forced quirkiness, sappiness, heavy-handedness) and emerges as a fresh, enjoyable, imaginative indie romantic comedy.

"Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic" finds Prince continuing the slick R&B; sound that he first utlized with "Diamonds & Pearls" and continued with the "Emancipation" collection. It's smooth and easy to digest, but lacks the raw, experimental quality that Prince had back when he was with the Revolution. Once again on a major label, Prince (or maybe his new record company) appears to be hoping to reclaim a mainstream audience, which might explain both the pop-oriented material and the array of guest appearances by other artists. The collaborations do create some of the better material ... the best one probably being "So Far, So Pleased" with Gwen Stafani. Prince and Gwen's voices meld well together, and create a sexy sound similar to when Prince produced No Doubt's "The Waiting Room" from their "Rock Steady" album. Cheryl Crow's signature guitar pop infiltrates "Baby Knows", but then Prince transforms Crow's own "Everyday Is A Winding Road" into a completely different song on another track. Rap cameos by Chuck D and Eve add spice to two other tracks, but that's about it. Other highlights of the album are the title track, which hints at electronica, and "The Greatest Romance Ever Sold", a slinky ballad peppered with middle eastern sounds."Rave" could be categorized the same way that "Diamonds and Pearls" could ... as "Prince Lite". Not bad, but doesn't compare to his earlier work. The sad truth is that Prince partied like it was 1999 better when it was 1983.

This film is not an "entertaining" one, and those expecting to be entertained in the way that a typical horror film entertains will be sorely disappointed. What this film is, however, is an expertly directed and beautifully acted exploration of human evil.The plot of the film revolves around a family of three (including wife Anne, husband George and son George Jr.) who are degraded, brutalized and tortured by two perversely polite, pretty young preppies at their summer home. Unlike the current "torture porn" trend in horror films, "Funny Games" relies on psychological terror instead of gory stunts, and the result is that's it's a thousand times more disturbing.When George asks the two young men why they're doing this to them, they mock him by coming up with trite, talk-show-psychology explanations. Still, it's profound. As the viewer, I started asking myself lots of "why" questions ... why do human beings do cruel things? Why do we torture each other, degrade each other, humiliate each other? And, after all the cruelty we inflict on each other in real life, why do we then want to watch it on a screen?Much ado has been made about Michael Haneke's willingness to break the fourth wall in "Funny Games", having the villians occasionally directly address the viewer. You could argue that it's a stunt that didn't really add anything to the film. But it's clear that "Funny Games" is an indictment of the evil in all of us.

As any fan of Kurt Vonnegut's novels knows, there are certain common themes to his work. "The Sirens of Titan", more than any other of Vonnegut's books that I've read so far (eight and counting), seems to pack all of his favorite subjects into one story. The subjects of science fiction, religion, war, political satire, time, fame, family, fortune and fate all come together to form a highly entertaining and thought-provoking story. Despite the smorgasbord of familiar Vonnegut subjects, the one theme that seems to stand out and rise above the others is the theme of fate. The characters in the novel all start out believing that they control their own destinies, and yet, time and again, find themselves simply pawns in the games of more powerful forces; often completely without their knowledge. Vonnegut seems to be ridiculing again and again mankind's delusion that he is somehow in control. To paraphrase a character in the book, "It's obvious that some being much more intelligent than I is in charge. Why shouldn't I just be friendly and try to have a nice time?" Who knew you could get such home-spun common sense wisdom from the planet Mercury?

Underneath all the outrageous antics, John Waters' films often offer a warm message of tolerance. In his early films, he chose misfits, outcasts, and "normal" people to play characters that reflected the strangeness of suburban America. In his later films, such as "A Dirty Shame", he chooses a combination of mainstream Hollywood stars (Tracey Ullman, Chris Isaak, Selma Blair), his usual favorites (Mink Stole), and pop culture oddities (Johnny Knoxville, David Hasselhoff, Patty Hearst) to populate his subversive world.If "Serial Mom" was a satire of the media's love of violence, and "Pecker" lambasted the pretentiousness of the art world, "A Dirty Shame" is an almost sincere (albeit very silly) cry for sexual liberation. Whereas most Hollywood films only allow for beautiful people to enjoy sexual freedom, "A Dirty Shame" makes the case for every person's right to enjoy their own sexual appetites, as long as, to quote Johnny Knoxville's sex guru Ray-Ray, "it's safe and consentual".To bring this message home, the audience is treated to a smorgasbord of hilarious and horny characters, including a trio of "bears", an adult baby, a "human vacuum cleaner", and a couple who enjoy "Roman showers". (Don't ask.)

What makes a book (or any piece of art for that matter) a classic is its ability to stand the test of time. "The Book" was written over forty years ago, but while reading it I felt absolutely no sense of any of the content being dated or no longer of use. If anything, while reading it I felt like it may as well have been written yesterday.In the beginning of "The Book", Alan Watts makes clear his intention: to provide a summary of what he's learned about the nature of life and human existence that could potentially be used as a sort of guidebook for becoming a true adult. This is the first book I've read by Alan Watts, and I don't know much about him, but it's clear that he's a man who's studied and been heavily influenced by Eastern religions and philosophy, and so this book could also serve as a handy introduction to Eastern thought to Westerners who are unfamiliar with its concepts.Since I've studied Eastern religions fairly extensively, the concepts explained in the book were not necessarily revolutionary to me per se. But I still found the book to be very inspiring, thought provoking, and interesting. What I especially enjoyed about it was the sense of playfulness and humor that was used throughout the book. So many books about spirituality or philosophy are so heavy and serious, and the tone of levity was a fresh welcome change. In fact, one of the main themes throughout the book is the importance of enjoying life; of having a sense of play and discovery and joy.Overall, a fresh, relevant, and transcendent work that I would highly recommend. Personally, I now plan on reading more of Alan Watts' work.

Although this is not a great film, "Beat" is better and more engaging than I thought it would be. I've never been a fan of William S. Burroughs (I read Naked Lunch and hated it), but this film is really about his wife, Joan (Courtney Love), who I knew nothing about before seeing this film, other than that she was killed in the bizarre stunt portrayed at the beginning and end of the film. "Beat" depicts Joan as the center of a small group of artistic, self-destructive friends who include famous writers Allan Ginsberg and William Burroughs (who Joan marries and has two children with, despite his open homosexuality). Before her death, Joan serves as long-suffering wife, friend, and unrequited love object for the three men who make up the dysfunctional little clique.What's interesting about Courtney Love is that a woman who has such an over-the-top, larger-than-life persona can actually appear very subtle as a film actress. In the late 90's, after her (deservedly) praised performance in "The People Vs. Larry Flynt", Courtney Love actually had a shot at a successful film acting career. "Beat" is the first time I think I've ever seen her playing a true romantic lead, and I was surprised by how well she does here. Courtney Love is not a conventional beauty, but with her wide, expressive mouth, husky voice, and air of mystery, she is believable playing a woman who served as a muse and object of desire for a small group of creative friends, two of which ended up famous for their contributions to the "beat" generation of writers.If Courtney had been able to maintain her sobriety and sanity, she could have emerged as a great character actress. This film offers a glimpse of what might have been.

After resisting for quite a while, I finally decided to check this film out to see what all the fuss was about. After seeing it, I get it ... this is an engrossing, smart, suspenseful film. As a thriller and mystery, it works better than at least 90% of the thrillers/mysteries Hollywood puts out, so I can see why even Americans would be drawn to the film.The film first introduces its two main characters, Mikael and Lisbeth, separately, and then gradually ties their stories together. Mikael is a middle-aged journalist about to be wrongfully convicted of libel (which is apparently a crime in Sweden punishable by prison time) who is asked by an aging aristocrat to investigate the 40-year old disappearance/murder of his favorite niece. Lisbeth is a troubled, 24 year old professional hacker with a dark and tragic past and an even darker present. She becomes acquainted with Mikael while first being hired to hack into his files, and then, after gaining an interest herself in solving the 40-year-old murder, is recruited by him to assist in the investigation.Lisbeth is a knockout character (played wonderfully by an actress, Noomi Rapace, who I've never heard of before but will never forget). She's a paradox and an enigma. She's clearly damaged after a lifetime of horrific abuse, but refuses to be a victim, doling out vengeance and violence mercilessly when appropriate. Yet she also clearly has maintained her own sense of morality and humanity. Noomi Rapace gives a subtly magnetic and charismatic performance, and you can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen.Although the film belongs to Lisbeth, her character has a nice chemistry with Mikael. As the two work together to dig through decades of one family's dark secrets in order to solve the mystery, the two develop a subtle, tentative bond. Lisbeth is guarded to say the least, but it's clear that she sees Mikael as one of the very few people in life she might actually be able to trust. When Lisbeth initiates sex with Mikael, it seems odd, for many reasons, but it makes sense in a weird way ... maybe it's Lisbeth's only way of showing affection, or maybe Lisbeth just wants to know what it's like to have sex with a man who isn't going to horribly abuse her.By the end of the film, the central mystery has been solved, and some more of Lisbeth's tragic past has been revealed. And as a viewer, I was left immediately wanting more ... which is why the sequel went immediately to the top of my "must watch" list.

"Wedding Crashers" is clearly aiming to be a raunchy comedy with a heart of gold the way "The 40 Year Old Virgin" was. But where "Virgin" succeeded in being both uproariously funny and genuinely touching, "Wedding Crashers" only comes across as mildly amusing. Vince Vaughn is funny and charming as usual, playing a motormouthed, hapless rascal. As his wedding crasher buddy, Owen Wilson basically just phones in his performance, and I almost can't blame him ... he's basically been "that guy with the nose and hair" in every recent Hollywood buddy flick. Rachel McAdams, who plays Wilson's love interest, is absolutely adorable, and steals the film, but it's too bad that her romance with Wilson isn't nearly as believable as she is. As for the comedy, some of the jokes hit and some of them miss, making "Wedding Crashers" a pleasant but uneven and lukewarm film.

Madonna is an enigma. She's a pop star who also happens to be a real artist, a flash in the pan that's lasted 20 years, and a pinup with the shrewd mind of a CEO. So it's no surprise that her 10th studio album, American Life, is full of contradictions. Musically, it juxtaposes folky acoustic guitars with abrasive techno beats and synths. Lyrically, Madonna uses her position gained by 20 years of brilliant marketing to preach, strangely, about the evils of the media, and the emptiness of fame and materialism. This is either a bold, sincere move or a load of crap. I think it's the former. Standout tracks on this CD include &quot;Hollywood&quot; (a song that's not about the specific place so much as everything in our world that's phony and illusionary), &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; (one of the most beautiful love songs she's ever written), X-Static Process (an acoustic lullaby about the dangers of losing yourself in a relationship) and Die Another Day (a misunderstood song about destroying your ego).

I just saw this film last night. I like checking out the amazon reviews of a film I've just seen sometimes, to see what other people thought. This film was challenging, ambiguous, and disturbing, so there are lots of differing opinions on it. It's open to interpretation in a lot of ways.The main characters in the film are not very interesting or likable people. They're like many of the people we all have in the periphery of our lives: they're self-absorbed, bland, not particularly nice but not so hostile that they really stand out. They seem to be together for reasons that some might call "the wrong reasons" but are reasons that bring many people together anyway: he thinks she's hot and likes having sex with her, and she seems like the type of woman who needs a man to validate her. Aside from sexual attraction and neediness, there seems to be very little genuine affection or respect between the two of them. He thinks she's a hysterical, childish little girl, and she thinks he's a heartless, insensitive prick. Somehow the two interpret this as love.Through most of the film, the two engage in mundane activities, bicker, and have histrionic, almost animalistic sex. Although it's all very slow moving and tedious, the film does a good job of providing a sense of impending dread and doom. It's subtle, but palpable ... you know something very, very bad is coming.And it does. And when it does, it's brutal, horrifying, and fast. And all of a sudden all the petty bickering, adolescent drama, and superficial pain the two characters have spent the film inflicting on each other seem incredibly small compared to the abject horror that life can inflict upon anybody at any given time.

Growing up, Tammy Faye Bakker was the tacky televangelist that wore too much makeup. That was all I knew about her. When she appeared on the "Surreal Life", she charmed me with her sincerity and graciousness, and it made me curious enough to watch this film.I found Tammy Faye Bakker to be a fascinating character. Full of contradictions, like all interesting people are, she seems to radiate an innocent, maternal charisma and down-to-earth charm, which contrasts wildly with her gaudy image and history of opulent living. She's a natural performer who seems completely comfortable in front of the camera; however her greatest talent seems to be her ability to reach out and touch the people around her. Her life is certainly fascinating and full of extremes: fortune, fame, addiction, betrayal, and all the stuff that entertainment legends are made of.To some, it might seem strange that a documentary about Tammy Faye, a devout Christian and televangelist, would be narrated by the world's most famous drag queen. But as the film progresses, you realize that it actually makes perfect sense, because Tammy Faye IS a drag queen: Larger-than-life, over-the-top, magnificent, melodramatic, gaudy, and ultimately triumphant.

"May" is the creepiest film I've seen in a long time. Mostly, it's a character study of a strange, isolated girl who works at a veterinary clinic, makes her own pieced-together clothes and talks to a doll. At first she seems to be nothing more than a shy, awkward, wounded soul desperately looking for love and approval. You feel sorry for her, you relate to her, you root for her. About halfway through the film, however, you start to realize that May isn't just strange, she's really nuts. Her character is slowly revealed to be a real psychotic with a taste for blood, and when it happens it's completely unsettling. We haven't seen a character like this since "Carrie"; a seemingly benevolent misfit pushed over the edge with horrifying consequences.The performances in this film are all really quite good, which is a nice surprise, and rare for a horror film. Angela Bettis' performance as May is a genuine tour de force; she convincingly shows May both at her most awkward and grasping and at her most sinister and bloodthirsty. Jeremy Sisto is perfect as the pretentious slacker who May falls for, and Anna Farris (of "Scary Movie" fame) is hysterically deranged as the (...)coworker obsessed with May.I'd highly recommend this film for anyone who isn't too squeamish or easily disturbed.

Lucy is a beautiful, but detached young woman. She goes to school and works two jobs, one in an office and another at a restaurant, but is cold and distant toward the people around her. She even has a detached and reckless attitude toward sex. In fact, the first scene of the film shows Lucy in a nightclub, allowing two older men to use a coin toss to determine which of the two she will have sex with.Struggling for money despite her two jobs, Lucy answers a local ad for unspecified services, and is brought in for an extensive interview which includes a detailed physical examination. After meeting the prospective employer's requirements, she enters into a strange, erotic world where old, wealthy men pay beautiful young women for various services. In her first "job," Lucy is merely one of a series of waitresses serving older men in various states of undress. However, by her second "job", her employers have found a new purpose for her ... which involves drugging Lucy into a sleeping state, after which older men can be alone with her and do whatever they wish with her sleeping body (with two ground rules of no actual penetration and no leaving of marks).Hence the title "Sleeping Beauty." However, for all its beauty and nudity, this film is not very sexy or erotic. The film, although beautifully shot, directed, and acted, has a relentless tone of detachment and nihilism. The people in the film find no emotional connection through sex; it's merely a tool for them to either make money, self-destruct, or satisfy unhealthy desires. The cause of Lucy's lack of warmth and recklessness are subtly revealed in the film (being raised by an alcoholic, irresponsible mother). However, the film's most interesting scene doesn't involve Lucy at all, but a monologue delivered by one of the older men who pays to spend time with her sleeping body. As he looks back on his superficially successful life, he admits that he's never found any real joy in his accomplishments, family, or friends, and it's a painful, brutal, but fascinating moment."Sleeping Beauty" provokes a question in me ... why are so many foreign films that explore frank sexuality so bleak and depressing? For a film that explores all the colors and emotions involved in human sexuality, I'd recommend John Cameron Mitchell's complex and cathartic "Shortbus."

For anyone who's ever been in a high school play or befriended an actor, Christopher Guest's &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; will hit hilariously close to home. The film, which revolves around a historical play being put on in a small Missouri town, is not so much a parody of small town life as it is a parody of drama queens everywhere. Corky St. Claire (Guest) is the play's director and producer, who every wannabe actor in the area worships simply because he once lived in New York (it's never really clear what exactly he ever did there). The small town folks who Corky casts in his play are a series of hysterically funny characters brilliantly portrayed by the likes of Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard. Filmed in a &quot;Mockumentary&quot; style, &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.

I saw &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; in the theater when it came out, and I remember thinking it was incredible. I also remember hearing lots of complaining from the other people in the theater on the way out. Basically this is a film you'll either love or hate. I think when it came out, people were disappointed because they were expecting a traditional &quot;erotic thriller&quot;, which this is not. This is a subtle, dreamlike, and very ambiguous film that explores jealousy, sexuality, death and the subconscious. I don't think most moviegoers (at least not Americans) are really comfortable with ambiguity in a film. They want clear, linear stories. But a film like &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, to me, is the opposite of an insult to one's intelligence, because it leaves many of the questions of the film up to the viewer to decide for himself. It is widely known that Stanley Kubrick finished this film right before his death. After watching &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, it occured to me that this film may have been his way of communicating that even close to death, life is still made up of many more questions than answers.

American Hollywood comedies have for a while been obsessed with the archetype of the American man-child. I'm not sure which film first started the trend, but Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow have certainly championed it. In so many recent Hollywood comedies, the main character has been a grown man, in his twenties or thirties, who seems to be stuck in perpetual adolescence. The characters are usually smart and witty but lazy and underachieving, have a penchant for drinking or smoking weed and a juvenile sense of humor, but yet - underneath it all - a heart of gold. Despite a wild premise, "Ted" is, at its core, another film in the pantheon of comedies featuring the archetype of the American man-child.John (Mark Wahlberg) starts the film as a lonely little boy who makes a wish that his teddy bear will come to life and be his best friend forever. His wish is granted, and "Ted" not only turns from stuffed animal to sentient being, but also becomes an international celebrity. The film then flashes forward 25 or so years later, when John is now a 35 year old rental car service employee who still lives with his sentient teddy bear, whose novelty fame wore off years ago. Only now, the two both speak in adult Boston accents, and enjoy sitting around getting high, watching "Flash Gordon" and making scatological jokes.This would all be well and good if not for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Like most films featuring the American man-child, the man-child has somehow managed to attract a beautiful, smart, poised and successful woman. So although Lori loves John, after several years together she begins growing tired of having to share her boyfriend with his crass, pot-smoking teddy bear, and begins wanting a more mature relationship. And so it begins - will John be able to move on from his adolescent inertia in order to hold onto his girl?For the record - this film is very funny. I laughed out loud many times. But underneath the original premise, outrageous humor and overall weirdness that the film often employs, the story of the man-child whose too-perfect girlfriend forces him to finally grow up is incredibly played out.

Meet the unlikely new mistress of horror: Dame Judi Dench.From the very beginning of the film, Dench's portrayal of Barbara is captivating, unsettling, repulsive and frightening. She fleshes out this character so wonderfully that not only do you feel like you know her, but you're sure you've met her before. A bitter, old teacher/spinster, Barbara hides her pathological neediness behind a condescending facade. That is, until she meets the latest object of her obsession: Sheba, an idealistic new art teacher. When Barbara catches overwhelmed, reckless Sheba having an affair with an underage student, she knows she has exactly the ammunition she needs to manipulate and control her. All cliches about the sexy, young "femme fatale" are obliterated here ... sexy Sheba is at the mercy of those who desire her (even the 15-year-old boy who beds her), while dowdy Barbara is ruthlessly manipulative; the perfect wolf in sheep's clothing to Sheba's vulnerable fawn."Notes on a Scandal" is a taut, tense, engrossing and wonderfully acted thriller that's not to be missed.

This album is intriguing and intelligent. It moves from order to chaos and back again, often in the same track. My favorite track is the slightly New Order-ish &quot;Don't Destroy Me&quot;, which is a trancey, throbbing meditation on ... death (at least that's my interpretation). Other highlights are &quot;Comfort of the Hum&quot; and &quot;Good on TV&quot;. The lyrics in the album are deep and meaningful without coming across as pretentious. The music is top-notch. I look forward to hearing more from Echoboy in the future.

The phrase &quot;laugh-out-loud funny&quot; is thrown around a lot, but it's truly the best term to describe &quot;Barrel Fever&quot;. This book is hilarious. David Sedaris' essays are full of ridiculous, delusional, and frighteningly normal characters who you both laugh (hysterically) at and at the same time can see parts of yourself in. David seems to understand that human beings are the funniest when they are the most self-unaware and plagued with delusions of grandeur. I'd also recommend &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;.

Dennis Cooper is an incredibly brave and original writer. His books, however, are not for the faint of heart. "Guide", which is part of a five book cycle that also includes "Closer", "Try", "Frisk", and "Period", is my favorite of his novels because he dares to include himself in the middle of his usual tales of drugs, abuse, exploitation, violence and depravity. He ingeniously draws from an article he wrote for "Spin" magazine about a handful of teenage runaways, and blends reality, fiction and fantasy to create a shocking and original novel. Is what takes place in "Guide" a truthful look into Cooper's own fantasy life? Or is it merely his way of showing how society sexually exploits and degrades young people? It's up to the reader to decide.

This film is incendiary, polarizing, engrossing, and at times sensationalistic. But I'm grateful for it. Whether or not you agree that America should adopt a universal health care program, I'm hoping that people like Moore bringing the topic into the mainstream will help perpetuate a dialogue about American health care, which, I think most people can agree, seems to be heading quickly to ruin.What the film does a good job of pointing out is that there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the health care profession, which is about healing and preventing illness, and the business world. Insurance companies make more money when they are able to find ways to deny people's claims. The result is the kind of horror stories that "Sicko" puts on display.

It would be pointless for me to really try to "review" this book. I can only highly, emphatically recommend it. This book is the first introduction I've had to Rumi, and it's been an incredible literary experience for me. This book has really touched and inspired me. I've been reading it slowly over the last few months, digesting it bit by bit, because I wanted to savor it instead of rushing through it. One day in particular, I remember being in a foul mood, fed up with people and the world, and after reading a handful of Rumi's poems I felt peaceful and transformed. If you have any interest at all in spirituality or poetry, do yourself a favor and buy this book.

I imagined that music from a band with the name "Mogwai" would be inventive, playful and strange. After listening to "Happy Songs for Happy People", I found that, while right about the "inventive" and "strange", I was wrong about the "playful" part. The songs on "Happy" are very pensive, melancholy, atmospheric and subdued. Downbeat, but not depressing, expansive but not pretentious. I dug it. I think I'll check out "Come on Die Young" next.

Although she had been in the Sugarcubes and had actually released her first solo album in Iceland as a child, &quot;Debut&quot; is what really introduced Bjork to the world as an adult solo artist. Of all her albums so far, this one is still the most dance floor friendly and probably the most commercial. But Bjork's incredibly expressive and unique voice and experimental spirit elevated this CD way beyond generic mid-90's dance music fluff. With &quot;Debut&quot;, Bjork emerged as an intelligent, intuitive, erotic and often jubilant musical talent. Highlights include the exotic &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, the playful &quot;There's More to Life Than This&quot;, the ecstatic &quot;Violently Happy&quot;, and the slightly melancholy &quot;Anchor Song&quot;.

I really enjoyed this book. I think people have a habit of idealizing childhood once they grow up, and forgetting how confusing, painful and even horrible it can be, especially when the adults who inhabit your world are abusive, dysfunctional, and even insane. Cruddy is a novel about a young girl doing her best to survive under such circumstances. It's part fairy tale, part horror, part John Waters film, and part Huckleberry Finn. But above all else, it's a really good read.

Walter is free from prison after spending 12 years serving time for child molestation, but he is anything but free. He's able to find work in a lumber yard, but when a suspicious co-worker digs into his past, his co-workers quickly turn hostile. A local cop routinely stops by his apartment just to threaten and belittle him, and remind him that he's constantly being watched. Worst of all, now that he's back out in the real world, Walter finds himself gazing longingly at the young girls he's so attracted to.When a sexually aggressive but warm co-worker, Vickie, enters his life, Walter seems to have a chance at a real adult relationship. Although her acceptance of his past seems unbelievable at first, Vickie reveals her own dark secrets and perhaps her attraction to Walter starts to make a little more sense. However, despite his relationship with Vicki offering a glimmer of hope, Walter still finds himself drawn to a lonely young girl he sees bird watching in the park, which leads to the film's extremely tense, uncomfortable but ultimately redemptive climax."The Woodsman" is a fictitious (as far as I know) film that puts a sympathetic, human face on pedophilia, as the documentary "Capturing the Freidmans" did. "The Woodsman", however, although filled with plenty of bleak and painful moments, offers its main character hope for redemption and perhaps even a shot at some happiness.Is this realistic? I honestly don't know.

I really wanted to love this movie. I really did. And it's far from terrible ... in fact, aesthetically, it's a gorgeous film, beautiful shot and art-directed, with a haunting musical score. Hugh Jackson and Rachel Weisz give great performances and have good chemistry. But something was just missing. I'm not even sure what, but it just didn't draw me in. I was hoping to be moved, provoked and inspired by this film, but I just wasn't. It certainly wasn't insincere, schlocky, or trite. It just didn't make the leap from interesting to resonant.I'd call this a bold, ambitious effort by a talented director who will surely produce more great films (like "Requiem for a Dream") in the future.

Chris Cunningham's work combines the experimental quality of fine art with the intrigue of cinema. Wow. There is some really awesome, crazy, beautiful, tripped-out stuff in this collection. Aphex Twin's &quot;Come to Daddy&quot; is incredibly intense, disturbing and powerful. Portishead's &quot;Only You&quot; is surreal, beautiful, emotional. Bjork's &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot; is cybersexual bliss. Madonna's &quot;Frozen&quot; is an arctic mystical trip. The stuff from the installations is really amazing too. What a talented artist!

I love this novel because it's a novel about spirituality that isn't the least bit dogmatic, preachy, boring or self-indulgent. It's actually a fairly simple story of one man's unlikely spiritual journey. Siddhartha goes from golden boy, to wandering Brahmin, to successful businessman to humble ferryman. Ultimately, he learns more by listening to the river than he did from Gotama the Buddha, riches, or self-denial. Just read it!

In "I'm the One That I Want" Margaret Cho combined her raunchy humor with an empowering reminiscence of her failed sitcom, subsequent breakdown and journey back to mental health. In "Notorious C.H.O.", she mostly ventures completely into adult territory, graphically, and hilariously, discussing a variety of her sexual experiences. Some topics include insensitive male partners, sensitive gay male friends, her period, her venturing into the BDSM scene, and sexual experiences with women. The result is not just raunchy fun (although it is that), but also political, honest, and empowering. Margaret Cho is such an important performer because she speaks for so many minorities who rarely really have their voices heard: female, asian, gay, etc. And she has the guts to put herself out there in such an uncensored and often unflattering way, that it's no wonder her fans feel such a connection with her.

Madonna has tried so hard over the years to establish herself as a film actress, that every time she makes a movie I secretly hope that she'll finally succeed. Unfortunately &quot;Swept Away&quot;, although not the horrific mess it was portrayed to be in the press, is a mediocre film. &quot;Swept Away&quot; is the story of a rich socialite who ends up stranded on a deserted island with a tempermental fisherman who she eventually falls in love with. The film is neither as funny or romantic as it was hoping to be. This isn't entirely Madonna's fault, but her performance isn't particularly great. I don't think Madonna is a terrible actress, but I think she should stick to supporting roles (like she did in &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, etc.) She just doesn't have what it takes to carry a film. The qualities that makes her a great pop star actually get in the way of her acting; every move she makes seems too smooth and choreographed and the result is that she appears wooden onscreen. Adriano Giannini is convincing and sexy as her love interest, and the two do have some chemistry. And the gorgeous Mediterranean scenery does make the film easy on the eyes. But overall, unless you're a huge Madonna fan, (or hate her so much that you'd really enjoy seeing her slapped repeatedly), I'd say skip this one.

See angelic, thoughtful young Tracy trying to fit in with the cool kids. See Tracy shoplift. See Tracy change her style from sweet to suggestive. See Tracy drink and do drugs. See Tracy have sex. See Tracy terrorize her mother. See Tracy cut herself. See Tracy flunk out of school. See Tracy's whole life start to unravel.And, after seeing all this, you ponder: who, or what, is to blame for Tracy's downward spiral? Is it her seductive, dangerous new best friend? Her natural adolescent impulse to form her own identity? A desire for acceptance and popularity? Her permissive, recovering-alcoholic mother or her self-absorbed father? Or is the whole of society to blame ... a society that produces self-loathing in little girls and encourages them to become sexual commodities as soon as possible?This film gives no easy answers. But it sure does expose the viewer to a disturbing and very real array of problems and questions.

I think that "Walk the Line" is less a biopic about Johnny Cash than it is a love story, and the most touching and believable one I've seen since "Brokeback Mountain". Joaquin Phoenix, whose deep, sad eyes have added emotional depth even to comedies like "Parenthood" and "To Die For", plays Johnny Cash as a passionate, intuitive artist, a hopeless romantic and a wounded, sometimes self-destructive soul. To his first wife, he's an irresponsible dreamer who's off chasing rainbows leaving her stuck with the everyday responsibilities of raising their children. So it's no wonder he finds himself smitten by June Carter, who radiates down-to-earth charm and maternal kindness. Now that I've finally seen this film, I can totally understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for her performance. She plays June Carter as a complicated woman; sweet and tough, humble and charismatic, passionate and moral. After seeing "Brokeback Mountain" I asked myself why it was that the most believable love stories are always the sad ones. "Walk the Line" offers a convincing love story with a happy ending. Who knew such a thing was possible?

Some of the exchanges between the coupled characters in "We Don't Live Here Anymore" remind me a little bit of the dialogue in Mike Nichol's "Closer": Brutal, scathing, honest, realistic and uncomfortable to watch. However, there' s a fundamental difference in the two films. The characters in "Closer" are nothing more than narcissists using romantic relationships to validate themselves, whereas the characters in this film are married couples with children who genuinely, on some level, love each other. It's just that all four of the main characters in this film have reached a point in their lives and their relationships where their once passionate romances have morphed into lukewarm, messy partnerships, and none of them are sure they want to stick around. As a result each of the characters starts looking to their best friend's spouse for the attention and passion they're not getting at home, and that's when things get really messy. Intelligent without being pretentious, as well as beautifully acted by some of my favorite actors, I found this to be a handsome, poignant little film.

"Harold and Maude" is not really a love story in the conventional romantic sense. It's more of a story about how one person can change another person's life just by being themself. Harold is a wealthy, bored, morose young man who gets his kicks by attending funerals of people he doesn't know and staging elaborate, fake suicides to rattle his mother. At one funeral he happens to meet Maude, another "funeral crasher". Maude, about to turn 80, is starting to wonder if her own death shouldn't be coming soon. The two quickly embark on a friendship (and, yes, even sexual relationship) which completely changes Harold's views on life. Maude is one of the greatest characters I've ever seen portrayed on film. At the same time daring and sensitive, childlike and wise, rebellious and spiritual, Maude is an elderly iconoclast whose fierce love of life has inspired her to free herself of almost all of society's restrictions. Frankly, she's my hero. At times touching, funny, inspiring and strange, "Harold and Maude" is one of my favorite films of all time.

I'm not a huge fan of self-help books, but something told me to read this one. I'm glad I did. It really helped me to understand things about myself that I'd struggled with for years. Before, I didn't understand why I'd freak out in crowds, why I'd often find myself retreating to stairwells or restrooms for solitude at work or school, or why large social gatherings often exhausted me when other people seemed energized by them. This book explains that highly sensitive people (HSPs) are simply a significant segment of the population born with a sensitive nervous system, and as a result are easily overstimulated and overwhelmed. It covers the pros and cons of being an HSP, and helps HSPs understand, accept and embrace who they are. If you suspect you are an HSP (or are married to or are the parent of one), I'd highly recommend this book.

Oz, HBO's first hour-long drama, tends to not get a lot of attention, mostly because of the wild success of &quot;the Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. But it is an excellent series. Prison really is the perfect place to set a drama series, because there's just so much drama inherent in the situation: violence, sexual abuse, mental illness, guilt, shame, redemption ... the list goes on and on. The writers and actors of &quot;Oz&quot; make excellent use of all the opportunities to explore the darker sides of human life. Aside from being an engrossing drama, &quot;Oz&quot; also serves as an excellent public service announcement, in a way ... because after watching a few episodes, a person would probably think twice about doing anything that could possibly put them in such a horrific situation.

It's almost Shakespearean the way family drama and dysfunction escalates into violence, death and ruin in this film. The best thing about this film is, by far, the performances. Powerhouses like Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Albert Finney, and Marisa Tomei expertly portray their duplicitous, grasping, and broken characters, finding the humanity underneath their amoral behavior. The editing and time-shifting are occasionally clumsy, but the acting more than makes up for it.

Of the three novels by Bret Easton Ellis I've read, this is my favorite. Unlike the ultra gory American Psycho, this book is disturbing and darkly funny in a mostly realistic way. It's about a group of spoiled students at the fictional Camden College who, for the most part, spend all their time smoking, drinking, doing drugs, and having sex. Despite all their wealth and access to substances, the characters are all miserable and emotionally crippled, unable to really relate to other human beings. Paul, who's sensitive and gay, falls for bad boy Sean Bateman. Sean (brother of American Psycho's Patrick Bateman, who makes a brief cameo in this book) is a promiscous drug user who falls for virginal Lauren. Lauren, however, is hopelessly in love with Sean's friend Victor. It's both sad and hilarious the way all the characters have fixated on other people who cannot return their feelings. And although I'd like to think most college kids aren't this screwed up, this novel does reflect in many ways the confusion and craziness of life post-high school.

This CD is just lovely. It's like sipping margaritas on a beach. It's like waking up sunday morning in the arms of someone special, realizing you don't have to go to work, and then falling back asleep and sleeping in till noon. It's like riding your bike down a dirt road and feeling the warm sun on your face and the breeze in your hair. It's like letting go of a helium balloon and watching it soar into the sky, until it finally disappears without a trace.

It's amazing that a musician as sonically adventurous as Prince would become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, but in the 1980's that's just what happened. And yet at the height of his popularity, Prince never seemed to try to cater to the masses. "Around the World in a Day", which followed the runaway success of "Purple Rain", is evidence of Prince's uncompromised vision. Easily the most experimental album of his career, Prince combines Beatles-like psychadelia (the title track), classical music ("Condition of the Heart"), political protest ("America"), standard Prince libido ("Tamborine") and good old-fashioned pop ("Raspberry Baret"). "ATWIAD" is second only to "Sign 'o the Times" as my personal favorite Prince album.

Take one look at the cover of "Lovesexy" and you can already tell where Prince is going with this album ... the cover, which shows a nude Prince sitting on a giant lotus flower with a beatific expression on his face, would be the picture of innocence and purity if it weren't for the strategically placed flower pistol that is a blatant phallic symbol. With "Lovesexy", Prince is taking his usual obsessions, sexuality and spirituality, and blending them together ... making sex spiritual and spirituality sexy.Prince's last album," Sign o' the Times", was a 17-track, diverse opus that showcased Prince exploring all of his favorite musical styles and emotional moods. "Lovesexy" doesn't try to top "Sign o' the Times" in terms of diversity or length. Instead, with 'Lovesexy", Prince creates a 9-song album that is musically and thematically consistent, blending all of the songs together into one 45-minute, creamy electro-funk odyssey. "Lovesexy" is spellbinding, sleek and beautiful, showcasing one of the best musicians in the world at the top of his game; the end of the creative peak that began with "Purple Rain". Prince has released lots of great music since this, but "Lovesexy" is probably the last great Prince album.

Okay, so JT Leroy never really existed. But that doesn't mean that the imagination that created him didn't conjure up a fascinating wealth of material that a talented auteur couldn't turn into a trippy, dark and entertaining film.I had never heard of Asia Argento before seeing this film, but she is clearly a talented director and actress. As a director, she manages to make the tale of an abused and exploited young boy both disturbing and entertaining. She does this by keeping the tone of the film trippy and surreal, as opposed to gritty and realistic, which suits the bizarre life that Jeremiah's punk/hooker/stripper/drug-addict mother drags him into. As an actress, Argento is also impressive: she portrays Sarah as a wild, damaged, fearless mess, who occasionally, with her husky voice and brash sexuality, bears a creepy resemblance to Courtney Love.Although Argento's performance carries the film, all three of the child actors who portray Jeremiah are excellent. And cameos by Winona Ryder, Marilyn Manson, and Michael Pitt all add flavor to the underworld of Jeremiah's existence.

"Jesus is Magic" is one of the funniest films I've ever seen in my life. I laughed almost constantly throughout the whole thing, and so did my friend and everyone else in the small theater I saw it in.Essentially a concert film, "Jesus is Magic" also features a handful of musical numbers and "mockumentary" style scenes. You could make the argument that the musical numbers really weren't necessary, since Sarah's stand-up is so shockingly, insanely funny. But without the musical numbers, I would have missed out on Sarah singing "You're gonna die soon" to a group of senior citizens in a nursing home, or her holding the microphone up to her different orafices, all of which have different voices.What I love about Sarah is that her comedy doesn't really seem to have any kind of agenda, other than to make you laugh hysterically as she constantly humiliates every ridiculous thing about our society.

This movie wasn't quite what I expected, but I still really enjoyed it. I thought that it would be a dark, edgy black comedy about a Christian high school. Instead, I found it to be a fairly straightforward teen comedy (albeit a clever and well-acted one). Although funny and well-written, the script tends to play it a little too safe, keeping the film from living up to its potential. However, the film is redeemed by the terrific, talented cast. The young actors flesh out their characters well, making them funny, deeply flawed and endearing. Mandy Moore is surprisingly great playing ruthless, holier-than-thou Hilary Faye, Eva Amurri (Susan Sarandon's daughter) is adorable playing good-hearted rebel Cassandra, and MacCaulay Culkin is snide and mischievious as Hilary Faye's wheelchair-bound brother Roland. The script does poke plenty of fun at the Christian church's youth ministries, and I can say from my personal experience (I went to church every week till I was 17 and attended plenty of Christian youth events) that it portrays the scene fairly accurately. However, for the most part, the film never really pushes the envelope too far. It almost seems as though the creators were holding back, afraid of offending people or seeming disrespectful. It's too bad. With such a talented cast, a less play-it-safe script may have turned this film into a classic like "Heathers".

The original "I Spit On Your Grave," from 1978, was shocking for its time. (I first saw it fifteen years ago, and it was shocking then, too.) However, since then, the "torture porn" explosion in modern horror has happened, and audiences became used to films like the "Saw" franchise, "Hostel", "House of 1,000 Corpses" and even art films like "Irreversible" which depicted all kinds of violence and torture on screen, especially being inflicted on females. So I suppose the filmmakers felt the need to up the ante with this remake.The new film does a fairly good job in the beginning of building the tension. Obviously, everybody knows what's going to happen, it's just a matter of when. This time the main character, Jennifer, is first assaulted in her rented cabin, as opposed to being assaulted while sunbathing on the river like in the original. The new film also offers a new cruel twist when Jennifer is briefly able to escape, only to run into a Sheriff who she believes is going to help her and who instead decides to take part in her brutal assault.And brutal it is. And here's where the film treads into morally shaky ground. Is the assault really supposed to illicit horror and disgust from the audience? Hopefully, yes. And, of course, on some level it's necessary to show the brutality of the assault and the degradation of the character, in order to justify the character's bloody revenge later. However, is there a fraction of the audience who will actually be turned on by the sexual assaults? And are the filmmakers aware of this? (Just asking. Because I think it needs to be asked. And for the record, I don't know if the assault in the remake was any worse than the original. And probably not the worst on screen rape scene I've ever seen either.)So Jennifer survives her brutal assault, and comes back for her revenge. And here's where the film really ups the ante, violence-wise. The main character's murder of her assailants in the first film was much more straightforward. In the remake, Jennifer concocts sadistic devices which are reminiscent of the Saw Franchise. (She's sort of like an improvising, backwoods Jigsaw, doing the best she can with what she can find.)I suppose there's always a little thrill in seeing evil people get their comeuppance. But "I Spit On Your Grave" offers no fully fleshed-out characters, no ambiguity, no real insight about society's violence again young women. It relies purely on shock and violence to illicit reactions from the audience.All in all, I think "I Spit On Your Grave" was a film that didn't need to be remade. For more intelligent films that deal with sexual assault and revenge, I'd recommend "Hard Candy", "Irreversible", or "The Descent."

I'm not an American Idol fan. I had heard the bland "A Moment Like This" single, as well as the vaguely fiesty "Miss Independent", and thought Ms. Clarkson was a talented singer being given uninspired material.So when I heard "Since You've Been Gone", I was surprised to find myself intrigued, and then shocked when I found myself absolutely smitten with the rest of the "Breakaway" album. The songs on "Breakaway" are catchy and surprisingly captivating, and the production is rock-oriented and fairly sparse, making sure the focus on every song is Kelly's spectacular voice. Damn, can this girl sing.There's nothing wrong with pop music if it's well written, well produced and well performed, which is definitely the case here. Kelly has one of the best voices I've ever heard, and as long as her material continues to live up to it, I'll be happy to keep listening.

The one thing that all human beings have in common is that we're probably the only species on this planet that has to live every day conscious of the fact that we're going to die. And yet, universal as it is, it's a subject that's rarely really dealt with. &quot;White Noise&quot; dares to deal with the subject head on. It explores the various ways human beings attempt to deal with their fear of death. Some choose to analyze the human condition intellectually, hoping to find freedom that way. Some try to medicate their fears away. Others attempt to face death through daredevil stunts. And then there are those who find a strange relief in violence and the domination of other people. &quot;White Noise&quot; offers no real comfort or solutions to the human condition, but it is a clever, entertaining, and thought-provoking read.

I just got the 1st season of "Weeds" on DVD for X-mas, and re-watched all the episodes that I haven't seen since they first aired a couple of years ago. Seeing the 1st season again has confirmed my opinion that that 1st season is still the best season by far. Here we find Nancy Botwin, recently widowed, navigating the still-new world of illegal drug dealing, and trying to keep it a secret from her children and the Agrestic moral majority.Remember when you were a kid, and you picked up a big rock or log in your backyard and discovered the creepy crawly world hiding underneath? That's what "Weeds" does ... uncover what lies beneath the pretty surface of suburban life. What we discover is both funny and sad; failed marriages, cynical children, crooked local politics, and sexual peccadilloes. In the 1st season, the focus was really on the characters, all of whom, for all their quirks, are fairly easy to relate to. Even when tragedies strike, such as Celia's cancer, the series maintains a low-key charm to it.By season three, the lives of Nancy Botwin and Company have spiraled so out of control and reached such a feverish level of peril and dysfunction that the show has lost much of that low-key charm. Here's hoping that season 4 is able to regain some of it.

In the first installment of the "Millenium trilogy", the paths of goth hacker Lisbeth and whistle-blower journalist Mikael crossed, leading the two to solve an intriguing 40-year old mystery involving a toxic aristocratic family. In the second installment, "The Girl Who Played With Fire", the focus is almost entirely on the monsters that make up Lisbeth's tragic past, and how they all seem to come together to create the central storyline. Lisbeth's past seems to be made up of a trilogy of monsters; all older men who used their positions of authority in order to abuse, violate, or silence her.After going abroad for 18 months, Lisbeth is back in town to deal with the first of her trilogy of monsters, the Guardian who brutally raped her in the first film. Her Guardian has apparently hired someone to steal back the videotape Lisbeth made of the rape that she's been using to blackmail him into leaving her alone. Lisbeth confronts her Guardian using his own gun, which unfortunately later ends up being used in three murders, leaving Lisbeth the prime suspect and a wanted woman. Mikael becomes enmeshed in the story when a young reporter working for his paper, researching an article on the illegal sex trade industry, is murdered, and Lisbeth becomes the suspect. Mikael knows Lisbeth enough to know she's innocent, and works to not only try to clear Lisbeth's name but avenge the death of the young, idealistic reporter.Two of the other trilogy of monsters from Lisbeth's past play central roles in the film as well; the second being the psychiatrist who abused her while she was illegally institutionalized as a child, and third, and most importantly, Lisbeth's father. Shown only in a brief flashback in the first film, when Lisbeth set him on fire at the age of 12, her father is apparently still alive, still horribly scarred physically by what Lisbeth did, and planning on killing her.Much of the film has Lisbeth on the lamb, both hiding from the police and from her father's thugs, as well as trying to find evidence to clear her name. Lisbeth, the character, is most compelling when she's in full-on fighting bad-ass mode, and this film probably has the most action of any of the trilogy, especially featuring Lisbeth. As in the first film, Lisbeth is an incredibly compelling character (playing by a compelling actress); magnetic, charismatic, vulnerable and yet indomitable.The film ends with plenty of loose ends, and once again, I find myself immediately wanting more. Now for "The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest" ...

When it comes to Chuck Palahniuk adaptions, David Fincher set the bar very high. With "Fight Club," he took Palahniuk's subversive, witty novel, and created a stylized, powerful allegory that was probably one of the turn-of-the-century's best films.Fast forward a decade later, and "Choke" adapts another Chuck Palahniuk novel into a quirky indie film. "Choke" is really not bad ... it's funny and entertaining and worth a viewing. But despite some intense subject matter (sex addiction, traumatic childhoods, dying parents) it all just feels really breezy. "Choke" contains the same wry, sardonic narration that "Fight Club" did, but lacks the power and pizazz.Maybe it's really not fair to compare the two films, but I can't help it. Since both films are so undeniably Palahniuk, I can't help compare "Choke" to its far superior predessor and feel a bit disappointed.

We live in a world of spin. Politicians, religious leaders, entertainers, teachers, and even our own friends and family are constantly feeding us censored, politically correct, and self-serving takes on the world.So who in our society is left that will actually tell the truth?Sometimes I think that role might solely belong to stand-up comedians, or at least the rare genius handful of them which Mr. Stanhope can be included in. In "No Refunds," Mr. Stanhope stands on a stage in a comedy club, his 40ish face bathed in unflattering light, clearly tipsy and chain smoking, and tears our whole phony, rotten society a new one.He's fearless, and no subject, no matter how taboo, is off limits. He talks about religion, abortion, pedophelia, antidepressants, the American work ethic, drug use, promiscuity ... you name it. His opinions are not politically correct, but neither are they just childishly put out there for shock value. Like Bill Hicks or George Carlin before him, Doug Stanhope's most provocative quality might be his sense of reason and logic in a world that often clings blindly to ridiculous and outdated ideas.

I liked this film. It was fun and interesting. It offers a glimpse into a world that I'd never want to be a part of, but that I find fascinating nonetheless. Macaulay Culkin, in his first real adult role, is actually quite convincing in his portrayal of club kid icon Michael Elig, and Seth Green is creepily charming as Elig's friend and mentor James St. James. The film follows Elig's journey from starry-eyed bus boy to famous party promoter to convicted murderer, while also portraying the decadent, opulent, strange world of late 80's early 90's New York club life.My favorite scene in the film involves Michael Elig, Enfant terrible, invading a burger joint and turning it into an impromptu rave. The mesmerized reaction from the bored young boy behind the counter really makes clear the reason behind Elig's appeal and fame: his ability to bring outrageous fantasy into the mundane, everyday world.However, this film also makes clear how Michael's same love of fantasy and escape also brings about his downfall. Irresponsible, excessive and callous, the film shows Michael spiraling out of control until he eventually murders his drug dealer/roommate Angel.Part period piece, character study, and cautionary tale, "Party Monster" is a wild ride.

Her chameleon-like persona has always been a big part of Madonna's mystique. Throughout her dazzling, spectacular "Confessions" show, Madonna plays many different roles: Disco dominatrix ("Future Lovers"), Acrobat ("Like a Virgin"), Martyr ("Live to Tell"), Glam Rock Star ("I Love New York") and many others.However, there is a point, about halfway through the show, where Madonna performs a mostly acoustic version of "Paradise (Not For Me). Sitting on a stool and strumming a guitar, Madonna appears as a middle-aged, slightly melancholy singer-songwriter. And it's the role that seems the most truthful and appealing.

After the most commercial album of his career, "Diamonds and Pearls", Prince returned a year later with another album with his new band "The New Power Generation", the title of which is the same androgynous symbol that would later become his name, but that fans refer to simply as "the Love Symbol Album".The "title" of the CD may be a symbol combining the symbols for male and female, but this album finds Prince adopting the most aggressive, masculine pose of his career. Musically, the sound has clearly been influenced by the "gangsta rap" scene in the early 90's, and there's something almost pimp-like about the tone of the whole album. Prince has always walked a fine line between objectifying and worshipping women, and here he is clearly leaning toward the former, especially with tracks like the horn-infused "Sexy MF" and "The Continental" (which features a useless "rap" by Carmen Electra). Of all the horndog tracks, my favorite is "I Wanna Melt With U", which might be the first track ever that shows Prince flirting with the emerging techno scene.The best tracks of the album appear toward the end of the CD, when Prince's thoughts turn from sex and romance to God and spirituality (as they often do). The cryptic, intriguing "7", the subtley seductive 'And God Created Woman" and the triumphant closer "The Sacrifice of Victor" are my favorites.

"Blue Valentine" profiles the relationship of a young couple whose marriage is on the verge of imploding, while simultaneously flashing back to the beginning of their relationship. This allows the film to explore how the very differences that attract two people to one another initially can become the same differences that eventually make a relationship unbearable.Cindy is a focused, dutiful, practical medical student. Dean is an impulsive, emotional blue collar worker. The flashbacks of the film show how the two meet, and, due to an unplanned pregnancy, quickly decide to marry and start a family. The flashback scenes make it incredibly obvious why these two people would fall in love: Dean offers Cindy spontaneity and romance. Cindy offers Dean stability and purpose.The scenes that take place in the present, 6 years after they meet, make it incredibly obvious why these two people would be unable to sustain a relationship, especially while raising a child. Dean just wants to be a husband and father, and enjoys the freedom of working a blue collar job where he can "drink a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning." Cindy takes her nursing career seriously, and makes it clear that she resents having to be the disciplinarian to their daughter, while Dean gets to be the playful, fun dad. Sensing they're on the verge of disaster as a couple, Dean tries to arrange an overnight stay at a cheesy theme hotel. Sadly, his plan backfires, and the couple's relationship finally implodes when Cindy refuses Dean what he needs the most (emotional and sexual intimacy), and Dean, in a drunken rage, threatens what's most important to Cindy (meaningful work and security).The film offers intimacy in a way that few films ever do. Not only are all the facets of the film's central relationship depicted in incredibly intimate detail, even the tangential relationships all maintain a level of intimacy, even if the screen time is limited (Dean's relationship with his daughter; Cindy's relationship with her ailing grandmother; Dean's relationship with an older co-worker; Cindy's relationship with her ex-boyfriend). The film is beautifully directed, written, edited, and shot. And the two leads are outstanding. It's wonderful to see two actors paired together who not only have chemistry but are equally matched in talent, intelligence, and commitment to their roles.

(2 1/2 stars)"Come" is the first Prince album from the period when he was openly fueding with his then-label Warner Brothers, and his resentment is apparent on this record. The tone of the album is dark and cold; the tracks are full of tight, polished grooves, but there's not a hint of Prince's usual playfullness or joyousness in sight. The title track, "Come", starts off sounding promising, but quickly becomes repetitive, and it's almost unforgivably long. "Papa" and "Race" explore the socially-conscious topics of child abuse and race relations, but come across as preachy more than they do as passionate. Neither track are anywhere as riveting as "Sign o' the Times". Of all the tracks, only the techno-dance "Loose", the space-y "Space" and the soulful "Letitgo" stand out ... and even these tracks pale in comparison to Prince's most brilliant work.All that being said, it's not that this is a bad album really, it's just that Prince is such a genius that his fans expect more from him. But I guess at the end of the day, Prince's music is sort of like pizza ... even when it's bad, it's pretty good.

Very rarely do I see a film that I really feel challenged by, but "Dogville" just blew me away. I just can't get it out of my head. There's nothing trite or easily digestable in this disturbing, provocative, brilliant and powerful film. I'll admit: this isn't an easy film to watch. It's very long, it's shot like theatre without realistic sets, and it's not a feel-good film. When you can see yourself in the horrible, repugnant citizens of Dogville, then you know you've fallen right into the director's trap. Is it a critique of America? Possibly. But I just saw it as the biggest indictment on human nature I've ever seen on film.

If you are a parent with a child in Junior High School I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Although it is horrifying, it will help you understand the kind of world your child is probably inhabiting everyday, and help you to be more kind and compassionate towards them. This movie so closely mirrored my own experiences that I almost wept. Not out of self-pity, but out of gratitute that someone else was finally telling the truth about life for many at that age. This movie does not exaggerate anything. Junior High School really is as brutal and humiliating as it is portrayed in this film. Aside from being realistic, this film is also superbly acted, written and directed. Todd Solondz is a genius.

Season Three of "The United States of Tara" takes a hard, dark turn. The show, one of my favorite cable shows in recent years, has always been unpredictable, and towing a fine line between quirky comedy and dark drama. With Season three, it definitely veers further into dark drama territory.At the end of Season Two, Tara discovered the cause of her DID (horrific early childhood abuse by an older half-brother), and at the beginning of the season, it seems like Tara is ready to move on by returning to college to finish her degree. In the process, she meets an arrogant psychology professor (Eddie Izzard, in one of the show's best guest spots). Tara's relationship with the professor is the season's best storyline, since he starts off a non-believer in Tara's DID, then seeks to use it to advance his own career via an academic paper, and then, eventually, comes to feel genuine concern for Tara as her condition worsens and threatens her very life.In each season, Tara has encountered new alters, and although all add a measure of chaos in her life, this season Tara's latest alter is her abuser, Bryce Crane, the psychopathic teenage half-brother who destroyed her life in the first place. For the first time, Tara has an alter who is more than just chaotic and inconvenient: Bryce, when he appears, seems hell-bent on not only destroying Tara's life, but the lives of everyone around her as well. In this way, the show makes a hugely risky creative leap, by making Tara herself the villain of the show. Bryce is so evil, sadistic, and without conscience that he may as well be a character out of a horror film.Obviously, Tara's danger to herself and others affects her family, who, for the most part, are moving on with their lives more successfully than Tara. Charmaine is now settling down with Neil and her new baby, and although navigating life as a new Mom isn't easy, she seems to be showing new-found maturity. So is Kate, who finds a suitable job as a flight attendant, and falls for a single father. Marshall, now in his late teens, is probably less sympathetic this season than before, because as he starts to bloom as a filmmaker, he also starts becoming more judgmental and obnoxious. (When Tara's condition and a personal tragedy strike, Marshall comes down to earth and his inherent sensitivity seems to return.) Max's main struggle this season seems to be the burden of continuing to be the emotional rock for everyone around him, as well as caretaker for an increasingly destructive and ill wife. Although even his own Mother (Francis Conroy in a good but somewhat wasted cameo) advises him to let Tara go, Max is committed to staying with his wife and children.As the Bryce alter wreaks havoc on everyone's lives, it becomes increasingly unclear what's really going on psychologically. Is Bryce's murder of Tara's other alters a way of cleaning the slate so that Tara can finally live a life on her own? Or is Bryce Tara's way of truly, completely self-destructing? One thing the show has never offered were clear, easy answers when it came to Tara. She's always been a complicated, messy, unpredictable, chaotic character, and Toni Collette's performance has always anchored and elevated the show. Every single outrageous plotline written for her, she's pulled off brilliantly.Since Showtime decided not to renew the series, the third season also serves as the final season, with the last episode serving as not only the season finale, but the series finale as well. Although when the season finale was conceived it was probably up in the air whether or not the show would be back, kudos to the writers for giving the viewers and fans enough closure with the last episode be able to gracefully close the book on this series' somewhat brief, yet entertaining and adventurous, run.

I love electronic music, and as far as I'm concerned "The Chemical Brothers" are the absolute best in the genre. Few (if any) other electronic acts have consistently delivered outstanding material over such a great length of time (this collection spans 10 years). Their music never fails to get my ass shakin' and expand my consciousness. And yet the brothers always seem to maintain some kind of a signature sound that lets you know that you're listening to the Chemical Brothers and no one else.As far as the first disk goes, which is the actual singles collection, I already had most of the tracks in my music library, although it's still cool to hear all the singles together in one CD. The two new tracks on the first CD are both really fresh: "Get Yourself High" is a hip-hop energy boost, and "The Golden Path" (a collaboration with the outstanding "Flaming Lips"), is a stream-of-consciousness spiritual trip. For the tried-and-true fans (like me), the biggest draw to owning this collection is the second CD, which is filled with unreleased and live tracks. "Not Another Drugstore", "The Duke" and "Morning Lemon" are just as inventive, unpredictable, and brilliant as anything on the Chemical Brothers' last few albums. The alternate mixes of "Galaxy Bounce" and "Under the Influence" are sweet too.The ending vocals to the track "Morning Lemon" sum up my feelings for this collection of superb material perfectly: "Take that, mtherf*%kers!"

I was lucky enough to be at the very concert in Detroit where this DVD was filmed, and although watching this DVD doesn't really compare to actually being there, it does serve as a wonderful memento of this beautifully art-directed, creative, provocative and thrilling show. Madonna was criticized for not putting more of her older hits in this show, but any Madonna fan knows that Madonna is not the type to rest on her laurels. And because I think her "Music" and "Ray of Light" albums were two of her best, I had absolutely no problem with the show containing mostly songs from those records. Madonna is also often criticized for her singing, but as far as I can tell she sang every single song live (with the exception of "Sky Fits Heaven", and only because she was flying through the air at the time) and her voice sounded better than ever.Some highlights of the show: "Candy Perfume Girl" (featuring Madonna playing electric guitar and a punk contortionist), "Sky Fits Heaven" (featuring Madonna flying through the air and kicking ass "Crouching Tiger" style), a spanish version of "What it Feels Like For a Girl" (featuring Madonna tango dancing with a female dancer) and a gorgeous acoustic version of "La Isla Bonita" featuring a variety of live percussion.No other pop superstar blends theater, fine art, fashion, cutting-edge dance music and just plain fun the way Madonna does. Rock on, Madge.

If you're looking for epic storytelling, this is not the book for you. "Who Do You Love" is filled with tales of more-or-less ordinary people. However, the author makes the stories extraordinary by fleshing out the motivations, thoughts, feelings, desires and flaws of her characters so ingeniously that by the time you finish the book, you feel like you've made a dozen new friends. Although somber, the tone is more sympathetic than dreary. This collection offers beautiful insight into the lives of modern, everyday, American people, if you have the patience and empathy to go along for the not-entirely-fast ride.

This film is an offbeat but engaging story of a young woman who is a true submissive. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Lee, a young woman who survived a stint in a mental hospital and a recent secretarial school graduate. She begins looking for work, and is hired by a lawyer, Edward (the always slighty creepy James Spader) who runs his office in a strangely old-fashioned way. Edward soon finds out that Maggie has a secret: she's a cutter, who deals with her emotional pain by inflicting physical pain on herself. Edward takes control of the situation, and helps Lee replace her cutting with a full-blown S&amp;M relationship with him. The film is funny and quirky, but also an affective portrait of a woman who can only truly find happiness through submission. Maggie Gyllenhaal manages to be funny, vulnerable, and sexy all at the same time. Overall, a very worthwhile film.

This is the first book I've read by Pema Chodron, and I really got a lot out of it. Like every other human being, I struggle with emotions like anger, resentment, envy ... and for so long, I just didn't know what to do with such feelings. Acting out on them is no good, but repressing them isn't either. Pema offers advice and practices for using afflictive emotions to wake up and increase your compassion for others. Her writings are never harsh or judgemental, and she encourages readers to be gentle and compassionate with themselves and the world around them. I highly recommend this book, and plan on reading more from this author.

*** 1/2With "Cheri", Michelle Pfeiffer returns to the period drama genre that has served her so well in the past ("Dangerous Liaisons", "The Age of Innocence"). This time, rather than play the innocent or unattainable object of desire, Pfeiffer plays Lea, an aging, semi-retired courtesan having a May-December romance with the son of her friend.Pfeiffer, one of my all-time favorite actresses, plays Lea as a woman who has spent her life choosing wealth, freedom, and privilege over genuine relationships. She's not cruel or heartless, but more of a composed, world-weary realist whose experience has taught her how to manipulate most situations to her advantage using charm and her still considerable beauty. Madame Peloux (the always formidable Kathy Bates), Lea's longtime friend and another retired courtesan, may not have maintained her stunning youthful beauty, but is perhaps more manipulative and shrewd than Lea. When Peloux's 19 year old son, Cheri, is becoming too troublesome, Peloux is shrewd enough to take advantage of the mutual attraction shared between Cheri and Lea, knowing that Lea will help refine the boy and teach him what he needs to know to become a good husband for the right girl. Lea and Cheri enter into a relationship meant to be casual, but end up living together happily for six years. Unfortunately, the two's unconventional relationship is threatened when Peloux decides that it's time for the boy to marry a young girl and give her grandchildren.Rupert Friend seems to be getting mixed reviews for his performance, but I thought he did quite well. He plays Cheri with the appropriate mannerisms of a beautiful, fatherless, neglected young man who's spent his life surrounded by privilege and debauchery. And despite their age difference, Friend and Pfeiffer share enough chemistry and heat to make the film's central relationship believable.The performances are all good, and the art direction is sumptuous, making the film very lovely to look at. The script and direction are just adequate, however, making this a decent film, but not a great one. As in all period pieces, the Mise-en-sc&egrave;ne is of a different era, but the themes are timeless. The characters in "Cheri" struggle with familiar human things ... being true to themselves vs. fulfilling the expectations put upon them, the sacrifices made for wealth and luxury, and the fleetingness (and benefits) of youth and beauty.

This CD, like Bjork's &quot;Vespertine&quot;, is the perfect album to listen to before going to bed (either solo or with company). Except for &quot;Scratch Bass&quot; (an up-tempo slice of electronica), the songs on this album are dreamy, seductive lullabies that help you drift off to the realm of the subconscious. Fans of the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; might recognize my favorite track, the gorgeous &quot;Heaven&quot;, from promos for their second season. Listening to Lamb beats counting sheep any day.

Missy Elliot may be the most creative, inventive, talented and ambitious woman working in pop music today. First of all, she is among the select few female artists who can both really rap and really sing (the only other two I can think of are Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah). On top of that, she is also a boldly original songwriter and producer. On her fourth album, we find Missy taking stock of her own life after losing two friends and former artists in the hip hop community. "Can You Hear Me", featuring the surviving members of TLC, directly addresses the losses of both Aaliyah and Lisa Lopez. In "Gossip Folks" Missy disses trash talking people, but the song is so playful and sonically adventurous that it doesn't sound bitter. The best tracks, as usual, are the ones where Missy is just out to have a good time. "Work It" is unbelievably infectious (and the remix w/ 50 cent is cool too), and "Slide" is a slammin' groove with bass to spare. Here's hoping that Missy keeps workin' it for a long time ...

By now, Judd Apatow's formula is becoming familiar. His comedies are populated by lovable, goofy, slightly immature male characters, strong, beautiful, vulnerable female characters, and equal parts gross-out humor, heart, and truth. In films like "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" this formula sizzled. In "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" the formula only creates a lukewarm movie experience.The usual cast of charming comedic actors are all entertaining and likable enough. (The breakout star of this film is Russell Brand, who shines as a benevolent womanizer.) So why does the film never really take off? It's probably the script. While in the beginning the movie explores male vulnerability and response to rejection, after the story moves to Hawaii the story mostly just becomes silly. Another problem is that the female characters aren't written very well ... although the actresses are sexy and charming, the script never really explores what makes them tick.Overall, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is an entertaining but forgettable, lightweight comedy.

My worst fear was that, without his Erasure partner Vince Clark, Andy Bell's album would be nothing more than Andy's beautiful tenor singing mediocre songs to generic dance beats. Thankfully, that is not the case. "Electric Blue" is, in fact, a dance album, but it's not only well-sung, but also filled with solid songwriting and excellent production. "Electric Blue", along with Madonna's "Confessions on a Dancefloor", might very well be the start of a "future disco" movement. Both CD's combine heartfelt, catchy pop songs with electronic music that is both futuristic and retro. My only criticism of Andy's album is that the two ballads seem tepid compared to the rest of the songs. Perhaps Andy might have been better off following Madonna's lead and sticking with the electrifying beats.Highlights: "Crazy", "Love Oneself", "Electric Blue"

Damn, it's such a shame. With horror-master Wes Craven at the helm, Kevin Williamson ("Scream", "Dawson's Creek") writing the script, and quirky, sexy Christina Ricci starring in a movie about werewolves in L.A., all the right ingredients were there for a clever, scary, and fun thrill-ride.What the hell happened?The supposed story is, "Cursed" was actually filmed two years ago, and the studio wasn't happy with it, so they were forced to re-write and re-shoot half the film. Then the studio decided to alter the film yet again, when they decided to go for a "PG-13" rating instead of an "R". The result is that the film that finally made it to the theaters is an absolute quilt of a film, patched together from multiple scripts and storylines. (If you were wondering why half of the scenes feature Christina Ricci with her real hair and half of the scenes feature her wearing a bad wig, that's the answer.) The story is uneven at best, the special affects are cheesy, and the film fails at being either scary or funny. All in all, it's pretty pathetic.Maybe, if we're lucky, we'll get to see a "Director's Cut" of this film on DVD, and see what Wes Craven really had in mind for this film. Because the version I saw in the theater was nothing but a neutered mess.

This album is just so much fun ... it's one big party. After their fantastic house/electronica album "Remedy", the boys of Basement Jaxx made a slight departure with "Rooty", which features songs written in a more traditional pop music style, with mostly conventional melodies, vocals, choruses, etc. But althought the songwriting is more structured, the music is even more outrageous, exuberant, eclectic, funky and inspired than "Remedy". "Romeo", the first track, is a straight-up bangin' dance tune. "Jus 1 Kiss" is pure, irresistable pop. "Get Me Off" is a sexually charged filth-fest that might make even Prince blush, and "Where's Your Head At" is an in-your-face track with a punk edge. The album is a mix of so many styles and vocalists, and yet every track sounds so consistently fresh and fun.This album is guaranteed to put a smile on your face. I can't wait to hear their new CD ...

It's hard to describe with words the sound of Air's music, because there's not a lot you can reference it to. The phrase &quot;tripped out elevator music&quot; comes to mind, but even that doesn't seem to do it justice. &quot;Talkie Walkie&quot; is otherworldly, soothing, beautiful, dreamy ... the songs sound both alien and familiar, like the soundtrack to a forgotten dream. My favorite tracks so far are &quot;Run&quot;, which extracts certain words from the verses and merges them with the beat, creating a trance-like affect, and &quot;Mike Mills&quot; which sounds like music you might hear at the Renaissance Festival on another planet. This is the perfect album to fall asleep to, make art to, make love to, or maybe play while hosting a sophisticated dinner party. Long live these groovy french dudes!

As with J.T. LeRoy's other book, &quot;The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things&quot;, it's hard to tell while reading &quot;Sarah&quot; whether what you're reading is a memoir, fiction, or some combination of the two. Whatever the case, &quot;Sarah&quot; is an entertaining, provocative and often funny read. Whereas the stories in &quot;Heart&quot; were realistic, disturbing accounts of horrific child abuse and the ramifications, &quot;Sarah&quot; reads more like a deranged fairy tale, set in the strange world of southern truck stop prostitution. The main character is an abused and neglected 12-year-old boy who decides to become a truck stop prostitute both as a way to compete with and reach out to his prostitute mother. While pursuing his "dream," he comes across a vast array of colorful, crazy and over-the-top characters, including deified pimps, superstitious hookers and perverse trucker johns. Although missing in action for most of this book, the presence of the title character and main character's mother, Sarah, is always felt, as he is constantly yearning for her approval, her attention, and her love.Sometimes there's a good reason behind "hype": J.T. Leroy is a remarkable talent.

"The Giving Tree" is my favorite children's book. I would recommend it not only for children, but for anyone who has a heart that is beating. The book is a simple story about the lifelong relationship between a young boy and his favorite tree. Throughout the stages of his life, the tree continually gives everything she has to meet his needs. Every time the tree gives of herself to the little boy, no matter how big the sacrifice, the book proclaims "and the tree was happy".This book rivals "the Velveteen Rabbit" as a children's book that is also timeless and inspiring literature.

Madonna's "Reinvention" tour found her in a very political and introspective state of mind, following her folky "American Life" album. And her "Confessions" tour found her playing the role of elder disco diva.With "Sticky and Sweet" Madonna's focus seems to be on youth. Following her "Hard Candy" album, easily the most commercial record of her career, and produced by of-the-moment hitmakers like Timbaland, Pharrell, and Justin Timberlake, the tone of "Sticky and Sweet" is youthful, urban, athletic, and fun. For the most part, the politics and avante garde artiness that Madonna often infuses into her tours is kept to a minimum. This is Madonna at her most basic: an unstoppable force of energy, bravado, and sexuality.That being said, I personally don't think this is her best tour. Maybe I miss the more provocative, rebellious, and experimental persona of the past. I like when Madonna pushes the boundaries of pop music and performance, challenging a mainstream audience into territory usually only reserved for the underground. That Madonna is mostly absent on "Sticky and Sweet," and instead we have a middle-aged icon in incredible physical shape singing high-energy pop songs, dancing up a storm, appearing youthful, hyper-energized, and ready to have a good time. And it's all well and good.But any Madonna fan knows that this persona won't last. We'll just have to wait and see what the lady comes up with next.

At the core of "21 Grams" is a story of three human beings who are facing the most horrifying and difficult situations a human being could possibly face. To portray these characters, the powers that be recruited three of the finest film actors working today, as well as a talented director smart enough to get out of their way. The result is (not surprisingly) a powerful, gripping film.This film is not easy to watch. These characters are going through hell. Naomi Watts portrays a grief-stricken woman whose husband and two daughters are all killed in a hit-and-run. Sean Penn plays the heart-transplant patient who receives her husband's heart, and finds hiimself living with a strange combination of gratitude, guilt and terror. Benecio Del Toro is the born-again Christian and former convict who accidently killed the family, and is tormented by guilt and rage. Watching Watts, Penn, and Toro tackle these characters is truly magnificent, but also heartwrenching. Rage, guilt, heartbreak, suffering, need, empathy, fear, hatred, love, lust, hope ... these characters showcase humanity at its most raw. There seems to be some debate about the affectiveness of the non-linear way their stories are told, but I thought it worked beautifully. All in all, a terrific film.

As someone who's been a fan since the beginning, I can say with certainty that a season of "Dexter" is only as good as it's villian. Since I found Jimmy Smitts' DA character in Season 3 to be the weakest villian so far, I was thrilled that Season 4 bounced back with it's best villian yet - John Lithgow's "Trinity killer".Actually, referring to each season's central antagonist as a "villian" isn't really accurate. Each season of Dexter revolves around a central relationship. At Dexter's core, he is looking for someone who he can be his true, complete self with. Someone who will accept him and understand him for who he is. In Season 1, this character took the form of a brother, in Season 2, a lover, and in Season 3, a friend. Sadly and ironically, finding these "genuine" connections almost always ends up threatening Dexter's "fake" life, and, so far, Dexter always chooses to save his "fake" life instead of pursuing honest relationships with the bloodthirsty soulmates who truly understand him.In Season 4, this central relationship takes the form of a father figure and mentor, played by the superb John Lithgow. What makes the season so mesmerizing is that, maybe for the first time, Michael C. hall, who is a fantastic actor, is paired with an actor who can really match his acting chops. The two have terrific chemistry, and to watch the two characters slowly chip away at each other's carefully constructed facades over the course of the season is thrilling. I have to say, that before the final scene of the season's last episode, I was finding myself a little disappointed that the show seemed to be ending its season in it's usual way, until ... BAM! The final scene that set the internet and fans on fire.The show's weakness has always been its supporting characters, whose storylines never live up to Dexter's in terms of being engrossing or entertaining. I've always liked the Deborah character, and I prefer seeing her paired with partner Quinn rather than with the late Doakes (was it just me, or did that actor only ever have one expression?). But her rekindled romance with Lundy was a boring subplot, and Quinn's love affair with Trinity's daughter was only slightly more interesting. In addition, I find both of the actors who play Angel and Laguerta to be charming, but putting them together into a forbidden office romance added nothing to the season.The season belonged to John Lithgow, and, of course, the final shocking twist. Regarding the former, I don't see how the show could possibly surpass this season's central nemesis, but regarding the later, season 5 will definitely see Dexter's life shaken up!

In the early 90's, before the "alternative" music explosion, new jack swing and rap ruled the airwaves. And it's clear that, perhaps for the first time in his career, with "Diamonds and Pearls" Prince was catering at least somewhat to a mainstream audience. It's still a Prince album, to be sure, filled with the usual sexual bravado (on the slinky "Cream" and the throbbing, intoxicating "Gett Off") and mellow political criticism (on the somber "Money Don't Matter 2 Night", and the closer "Live 4 Love"). But the musical influences on the album never stray far from fairly conventional R&B. The album does take a slight detour with the jazzy "Strollin'", but it's a far cry from the sonic adventurousness of "Around the World in a Day", or even the preceeding "Graffiti Bridge". Just call it "Prince Lite".

I finally watched this film after years of being curious about it. It was really pretty cool. Visually, it's stunning; a sci-fi/noir hybrid similar in tone (at least aesthetically) to "Bladerunner".Although the film is visually provocative, as well as intelligent and interesting, the main weakness is that none of the characters are really particularly engaging or well-rounded. So once you get past the nifty visuals and heady plot twists, there's not much to hold onto.It's interesting that this film came out so close in time to "The Matrix" because there really are a lot of similarities. Both films explore the idea that the mundane, everyday world around us is really all a ruse, and that some other force is using modern-day humanity as a pawn to advance their own agenda. And in both films, the main character is a unique man who has the ability to transcend the illusory game he's been plugged into and create his own destiny. I suppose both films are just modern takes on the age-old "free will vs predestination" dillemna.

With "Timequake", Vonnegut's final novel, he is clearly looking backward. When the universe stops expanding, everyone on the planet is forced to relive the last ten years of their life exactly as it had been before. Although this clearly ties in with Vonnegut's common theme of fate and predestination, the loose plot of the novel is mostly an excuse for Vonnegut to reminiscence.You could almost call "Timequake" a memoir, albeit a highly unconventional one. Vonnegut includes both himself, aging famous author and family man, and his literary doppelganger Kilgore Trout, aging obscure author and vagabond, in this book. Together, perhaps, they both form the yin and yang to his psyche.Vonnegut has a lot to say about a lot of things. And instead of hiding his opinions behind satire or science fiction, he mostly just comes out with it. He talks about family, politics, the sexes, art, fatherhood, work, money, class and all of life's other big topics in a clever, straightforward and thoughtful way. He tries hard to remain humble and resist the urge to preach. But he can't help exposing himself as a sensitive, moral humanist.

I really enjoyed this book. I read it almost entirely in one evening. I've read other novels about floundering suburbanites, such as "The Ice Storm" or "Rabbit, Run", but what made "Little Children" different is how much effort Tom Perrotta put into really fleshing out the characters and making them seem like real, flawed, funny, sad, interesting people. As the book goes on, even when the characters are behaving in ways that, on the surface, might seem selfish or ridiculous, you find it hard to judge them for it. Although much of the novel is darkly comic, the overriding empathy the author seems to feel for his characters always seems to shine through. I saw this book as less of a satire or critique of suburbia and more of a story about how growing up is a continuous process. The characters in "Little Children", 30ish and up, are still in the process of coming to terms with who they are and the world around them.

On principle, I wanted to hate this movie. I'm really tired of movies or television shows that exploit the gay community, depicting all gay men as cartoonish drama queens obsessed with superficial things, while dubiously preaching "tolerance". And in terms of the story, it's derivative and borrows from a slew of other movies including (but not limited to) "Sister Act", "To Wong Foo", "Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion" and even "Thelma and Louise". But there was something about this movie that made it impossible for me to hate it. Perhaps it was the sincerity of all the lead performances. Or the love of music that permeates every aspect of the film. Or maybe it's just that Toni Collette is so amazing that she can make anything watchable. In any case, for all its flaws, "Connie and Carla" was amusing and enjoyable enough to watch once. But I don't plan on any repeat viewings.

I honestly have no idea how much of this book is fiction and how much is memoir, but while reading it I had a sneaking suspicion that it was all true. Ultimately, I suppose it doesn't really matter: "The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things" is an extraordinary book either way.Jeremiah, the young protagonist, is a child totally at the mercy of all the adults in his life, who are all insane, predatory and heartless. He is horrifically abused physically, sexually and psychologically until he completely loses all sense of self and identity. The tales are told so lucidly and honestly that the reader can completely understand why Jeremiah eventaully both learns to mistake pain for love and wages a personal war against his own body and sexual identity.In a way Jeremiah's story is a metaphor for how our exploitive society eventually destroys all our children's sense of self. God help us all.

TrueBlood is my favorite show. When the current shows are airing, the show actually makes Sunday nights worth looking forward to. It's so much fun, and yet it's so smart. It's funny. It's sexy. It's thrilling. It can be creepy. It's awesome.Whereas the first season stayed mostly faithful to the first book in Charlaine Harris' series, the second season of TrueBlood goes completely off the map. I think this is great ... because since I've already read all of the books, I still have the opportunity to be constantly surprised by the series. For example, the Maenad, who was but a small blip in the second Sookie Stackhouse novel, is turned into one of the best villianesses in TV history. Alan Ball has a knack for taking the small supporting characters in the novels and giving them complex, interesting, and intertwining storylines. Jason, Tara, Sam, Lafayette, (whose ill-fated character lives on in the show, unlike in the books), Eric, Hoyt, and Jessica all continue to thrill and surprise me with their comic, thrilling, and often tragic journeys.I can't wait till season 3!

"Closer", the first in a five book series of short novels, is hypnotic and disturbing. Dennis Cooper's spare and elegant prose documents the lives of young people in our society who are constantly being exploited. With no support, no sense of themselves, and no real hope for anything better, the characters in this novel stumble toward bleak and sometimes gruesome fates. Dennis Cooper's novels are a wake-up call to a society that is traumatizing its children.

Toni Colette is such a powerhouse and chameleon-like actress that a show like "The United States of Tara" is the only way a television show could possibly make the use of her talents. Because she's playing a character with DID, the show allows her to portray four distinct characters, all of which she does with sensitivity, skill, humor, and passion.Aside from Colette's performance, the other thing that makes the show worth while is that, unlike with Showtime's other half-hour dramedy, "Nurse Jackie", in "The United States of Tara" most of the supporting characters are just as interesting. Tara's teenage children, Kate and Marshall, are especially great characters. So many films and TV shows get teenagers wrong ... either portraying them as miniature adults or cookie cutter stereotypes. But Kate and Marshall are both unique and multi-faceted young people whose reactions to living with a mentally ill parent are believable, funny, and touching. John Corbett, who plays Tara's good guy husband Max, is usually mellow and affable onscreen. But as the season went on, the cracks, frustrations, and flaws that started to show through in the character made him more interesting. Rosemarie Dewitt, another interesting actress, plays Tara's sister, who is equally co-dependent and resentful towards Tara's illness.All in all, "The United States of Tara" is one of my favorite new shows to come along in a long time, and I'm hoping it sticks around and continues to grow for a while.

I had every intention of giving Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" a chance. I never saw "Passion of the Christ". And I'd like to think I'm capable of enjoying an artist's work despite their personal meltdowns (which is why I can enjoy a Roman Polanski film)."Apocalypto" starts out promising, by introducing the viewer to a likable Mayan village. (Although even in the beginning, jokes about eating testicles and having to procreate in front of your mother-in-law seem to add an unnecessary crudeness). However, as soon as the village is invaded by the ruling Mayan tribe, the film just descends into an orgy of violence, gore and ugliness that just goes on and on and on.By focusing on the characters and using the violence more sparingly, Gibson could have created a better film. But instead, he just throws as much carnage at the screen as he can. A jaguar rips a man's face off. Decapitated heads bounce off a temple. A huge mass grave of headless corpses attract a barrage of flies. After a while, after being assaulted with the relentlessly grotesque imagery, you just become desensitized to it all. And since the characters are never really developed enough for you to really relate to them, the result is that it all just becomes ... tedious.

I decided to read this book after hearing it was Bjork's favorite (I'm a huge fan). Like most people, I found it shocking and disturbing (and I'm not someone who's easily shocked), but not without merit. It really reads like a dream ... the kind you want to forget as soon as you wake up, and the kind you would never, ever want to describe to anyone else. So there's a definite courageousness to this book. The author had the guts to put all his demons right out there for all the world to see (well, read), and so, as disturbing as the book is, you have to respect that.

The main problem with "Love and Other Drugs" is that, throughout the duration of the film, it seems to be suffering from a constant identity crisis. The film can't seem to decide if it wants to be:a) a conventional romantic comedyb) a Judd Apatow-style comedy about an overgrown man-child who finally grows upc) a serious drama about falling in love with someone with a degenerative illness ord) a satire of the health care industryWhat salvages the film are its two leads. Anna Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal first appeared together in "Brokeback Mountain" playing two people stuck in a passionless marriage of convenience. In "Love and Other Drugs," the two play a couple madly in lust, and, despite their better judgment, love with one another. Both Hathaway and Gyllenhaal are talented, charismatic, and very sexy actors and each give their characters the depth the film desperately needs (especially since all of the supporting characters are hopelessly two dimensional.) Gyllenhaal plays Jamie as a lothario whose superficial charm masks a deep-seated emptiness. Hathaway's Maggie is full of sexual bravado and sharp-tongued wit, but scratch the surface and her character's anger and bitterness about her young-onset Parkinson's comes raging to the surface.The film is worth a watch just for the great performances and chemistry of its leads. But much of the film comes across as trite, especially since it deals with such heavy subject matter, and the ending is just an embarrassing Rom-Com clich&eacute;.

Between &quot;Live Through This&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, Courtney Love lost her husband, got off heroin, and started a second career as a (surprisingly talented) film actress. &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; sounds a lot like Courtney was appearing at the time: a little cleaner, a little more friendly, but still packed with plenty of edge and unpredictability. Most of the songs are fairly melodic, and the production is filled with glittery little touches here and there. But nothing ever really gets in the way of Courtney's raw, powerful vocals. She still has rage and angst to spare, and her fans wouldn't want her any other way.

Ah, the drug film. A genre unto its own, drug films tend to either a.) Portray drug addiction as a horrific nightmare ("Requiem for a Dream") b.)Use it as a tool for dark, twisted comedy ("Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas") or c.) Some combination of the two ("Trainspotting"). "Candy" is clearing aiming for the a) category, portraying young Australian lovers Dan and Candy, whose lives spin out of control when they become heroin junkies.If the subject wasn't so familiar in modern cinema, this film might have been powerful and shocking, but since so many superior films have already covered familiar territory, the film comes across as derivative at best and melodramatic at its worst. The film is clearly aiming to show how degrading drug addiction is, so we see Dan and Candy stealing, lying, living in squalor and prostituting themselves to feed their habit. Often the film goes so over the top that instead of being shocking, my reaction was more like "Oh, come on!" ... the most obvious example being when Dan and Candy are left in the hospital to cuddle with their dead, stillborn baby.What saves the film is the performances. Heath Ledger is terrific, fleshing out the lazy, self-indulgent, romantic and ultimately more practical character of Dan. (And I'm not just giving him props because of the circumstances of his recent tragic death). Geoffrey Rush also gives a fine supporting performance playing Dan and Candy's flamboyant "mentor". Abbie Cornish gives a decent performance (though not on the same level as Ledger or Rush), but her character is written as so histrionic that it's hard to imagine any actress really excelling in the role.Overall, I'd call this a mediocre film with good performances that is probably worth a look if you're a fan of the drug film genre or of Heath Ledger.

I'd been curious about this film for a while, and after seeing it I can honestly say that it exceeded all my expectations. This film explores the rich, complex emotional lives of a variety of characters. While superficially the characters are all very different (straight, gay, partnered, single, rich, poor, etc), what they all have in common is that they're all at a crossroads in terms of their sexual behavior, and how it either helps them to connect with other people and their own true selves, or not. To quote one of the actors in the film from the (excellent) documentary in the special features section of the DVD, the sex is really just a metaphor for something else. "Shortbus" is a deep, joyous, cathartic and beautiful film.

This album will always hold a special place in my heart, because it helped me get through a very rough time in my life. "Little Earthquakes" is a self-portrait of a young woman coming to terms with the demons of her childhood and youth. By spilling her guts in such a raw and honest way, she makes her personal pain universal. "Crucify" explores the self-hatred every human being grapples with, and also ties it to the shame that many in the Christian church perpetuate. "Silent All These Years" deals with the parts of ourselves that we constantly censor, and yet are always dying to come out. "Precious Things" recalls childhood needs unmet, and "Leather" is about sexual partners who have no real emotional connection. And "Me and a Gun", an a capella song describing a rape, is one of the most disturbing (and maybe important) songs ever recorded. Since this album, Tori's music has become lyrically more vague and musically more adventurous (though still excellent). But this frank and stripped down debut will always be my favorite of hers.

This isn't a poor film by any means, but I was disappointed in it. As a huge fan of Charles Bukowski, I just didn't feel that it reflected all the humor, desperation, sensitivity and everyday tragedy of his novels and stories. Mickey Rourke's performance wasn't awful, but it seemed a little forced and awkward. Faye Dunaway, however, is excellent as Hank's (aka Charles') nihilistic, alcoholic girlfriend. Overall, though, I suppose when I feel the need to visit Bukowski's world, I'll stick with his stories.

In the world of filmmaking, genres must occasionally be reinvented; otherwise they become predictable and stale. In the late 90's, West Craven reinvigorated the horror genre with "Scream," by combining sly self-awareness and humor with genuine scares. Not since "Scream" has a mainstream film come along and reinvented the horror genre like "The Cabin in the Woods".The film begins with two opposing and intertwined storylines. One is the oldest clich&eacute; in the world - 5 attractive college students decide to head off to a cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun, sex, and substance abuse. It's a surprise to no one that terror, bloodletting, and death await them. But there's another storyline happening; where a group of corporate drones are watching the youngsters on TV screens, anticipating their actions as if they're producers making a reality show. If that were the case, then the film would hardly be fresh and original. Tying reality TV to horror has been done many times in recent years. So what, exactly, is really going on with the workers watching the kids, and why does their fate alternately amuse, entertain, and terrify them?To give anything else away would be a crime, because the best thing about this film is its unpredictability. If you think you know what's coming ... you don't. Lots of films and television shows try so hard to shock, titillate, or surprise their audience that the tactics just come across as empty and manipulative, but "The Cabin in the Woods" has genuinely new, fresh ideas that it executes expertly.I will give one thing away ... the ending of this film offers no possibility for a sequel. So as an added bonus, fans of the film won't have to watch a fresh, original piece of filmmaking turn into a redundant franchise.

"Downloading Nancy" is the best film I've seen in a while. What is so impressive about it is its ability to make the characters in an almost unbelievable story so believable.Nancy wants to die. After suffering horrific childhood abuse, and being stuck in a loveless marriage for 15 years, she can only really feel alive when she's in physical pain. To cope, she cuts herself, but her fantasy is to find a sexual sadist willing to take her life for her. Enter Louis, who she meets on the internet, and who is willing to serve as her sexual dominant and eventual murderer.Louis is the yan to Nancy's yin. He deals with psychic pain by inflicting physical pain. His demeanor is calm and controlled, as opposed to Nancy's histrionics. They're soul mates. They understand each other. And ultimately, when Louis acts, it's out of love.What makes the film is really Maria Bello's powerhouse performance. Nancy is not an easy character to like - she's a person who's so determined to die that she's lost any desire to maintain any kind of dignity. She can be harsh, abusive, cruel ... and yet the actress makes her pain so real that it's hard to fault her for anything she does. She is somehow able to make this disturbed, ruined woman both relatable and even lovable.

By switching from F/X to DirecTV, two things are obvious from the beginning of the 4th season of "Damages". First, the production budget is clearly less substantial. Second, the show is no longer bound by network standards, and mostly this is apparent due to an abundance of f-bombs. These elements give the season more of the feel of an independent film, as opposed to a glossy network drama.But the show remains compelling. Mostly this is due to the central characters of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) and Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne), the complex and twisted relationship these characters share, and the chemistry between the two actresses that play them. Patty and Ellen's relationship is part mentor/prot&eacute;g&eacute;, part mother/daughter, part predator/prey and part just full-on catfight. Patty is a brilliant, manipulative and often vicious woman whose heart beats occasionally. Ellen is a brilliant, mostly well-intended woman who often finds herself capable of more manipulation and viciousness than she thought possible. This yin/yang dynamic drives the series.Almost as important as the two leads are finding compelling actors to play the season's villains, who are usually powerful people caught up in corruption and atrocity and desperately trying to avoid having their secrets come to light. This season offers John Goodman as CEO of a Blackwater-esque private company involved in the war in Afghanistan. After one of their missions goes terribly awry, several of its employees are murdered, and a ruthless mercenary (Dylan Baker, even more terrifying than he was in "Happiness") is at the center of it.It seems that some people were unhappy with the show's decision to take on the wars in the Middle East, but I don't see why they would be. It's just as topical as last season's "Ponzi-scheme-on-a-massive-scale" case. John Goodman's character is a fascinating study in compartmentalization. The character routinely makes decisions that involve torture, abuse, and murder, but is then able to carry on his roles as father and religious leader without seeming too conflicted. This is believable partly due to John Goodman's performance, but also due to how commonplace such people are.

Exploring modern race relations in film isn't an easy thing to do. It's too easy to come across as preachy or trite, and very difficult to explore the subject as the complicated and messy thing that it is."Crash" more or less succeeds in orchestrating a symphony of different characters in modern Los Angeles, all of different races, ages and social status, and showing what happens when they "crash" (hence the title) into one another in tumultuous and often violent circumstances. Some highlights of the film (and cast) include: Sandra Bullock playing against type as a rich, self-entitled woman who becomes the victim of a carjacking, Ludacris as a car thief who justifies his actions through armchair philosophy, Thandie Newton as an Ivy-league woman groped by a racist cop, and Ryan Phillipe as a self-righteous rookie cop who discovers that his moral superiority is just an illusion.Although well acted and executed, what this film is lacking is a unique vision of its own. It plays like a cross between P.T. Anderson's "Magnolia" (where an ensemble cast experiences drama and tragedy while their lives intersect) and Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" (where characters of different races confront one another with brutal honesty that escalates into violence). It's because it doesn't really have a style of its own that "Crash" doesn't make the leap from a good film to a great one.

I can't help but love Courtney. She's a true original: a messy, volatile, talented and brilliant force of nature whose self-destructiveness is matched only by her resilience. On &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot;, Courtney sounds like a woman in a very dark and desperate place. The lighter touches and more pop production found on Hole's last &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; album are completely gone now; these songs all speak of bitterness, desperation, fury and drugs. Courtney's vocals sound more raw and ravaged than they ever have before. On my favorite track, &quot;Sunset Strip&quot;, Courtney closes the song with an extended rant that sounds like it was recorded after a two-hour drunken screaming match. And yet it works, because the vocals seem to fit the song's exhausted, bitter tone. Other highlights of the CD are the opening track &quot;Mono&quot;, in which Courtney positions herself as the antidote to the pathetic manufactured rock music of today (&quot;Is this the part in the book/where I gotta come and save the day?&quot;), and &quot;I'll Do Anything&quot;, where seen-it-all-done-it-all Courtney practically dares God/society/her lover/etc. to try and hurt or shock her.All this being said, I don't think &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot; is Courtney's best work; I think both of Hole's last studio albums were better. But I'd still call this is a worthwhile album. I'll take even a subpar Courtney over powderpuff wannabes like Avril Lavigne any day.

When Pink burst onto the scene years ago with the vaguely fiesty "There You Go", she seemed like just another teen pop clone. Who would have guessed that she would emerge as a unique star who sometimes comes across as a fiery combination of Joan Jett and Madonna?With "I'm Not Dead", Pink continues to grow artistically, and seems to have found an appealing middle ground between confessional, catchy pop music and edgy rock. With the first track and first single, "Stupid Girls", she boldly takes on the insipid nymphets that have captured the media's attention lately. But after the Kelly Clarkson-ish "Who Knew?" the album quickly turns much more personal. "Long Way to Happy" rocks hard, but the lyrics and delivery are more passionate and wounded-sounding than most ballads. "Dear Mr. President" (featuring the Indigo Girls) critiques our current commander-in-chief, and goes farther than most pop stars would ever dare. Then just when you think Pink might be in danger of taking herself too seriously, she half-celebrates and half-mocks her need for living large on "Cuz I Can". One of the most interesting tracks on the album is the hidden one, in which Pink let's her father take center stage, and croons in the background while he sings a deeply touching self-penned folk song about the Vietnam war. Over and over again, Pink proves her ability to affectively deliver songs in a variety of different musical styles and moods.On "I'm Not Dead", Pink comes across as many things ... talented singer, social critic, fiery tomboy and wounded soul. One thing she is definitely not is a stupid girl.

The 90's were a frustrating time for die-hard Prince fans. Although Prince released a lot of music, much of it was either self-indulgent overkill ("Emancipation"), or lackluster contractual obligations ("Come"). Although there were always gems in every collection of music he released, "The Gold Experience" is by far the most solid, consistent and accessable album Prince had released in a very long time.Prince is one of the most versatile musicians of all time, and his best albums are the ones where his various musical influences and personas are all allowed to be expressed (see "Sign o' the Times", "Purple Rain", "Around the World in a Day"). With "The Gold Experience", all the different shades of Prince are back: Prince the tender lover ("Shhh", "Eye Hate U"), Prince the partyman ("Now"), Prince the social critic ("P Control", "We March"), and Prince the spiritual seeker ("Dolphin", "Gold")."The Gold Experience" doesn't break any new ground, but it is a welcome return to form for one of the greatest artists in music.

Todd Solondz' "Happiness" is one of the most disturbing films I'd ever seen. It's also excellent. It explores the ickiest, most pathetic and repulsive parts of modern human life, and deftly combines tragedy with pitch-black humor. Over a decade later, Solondz clearly felt the need to revisit the characters from that film, hence this sequel "Life During Wartime". Instead of trying to recruit the original actors to reprise their roles, Solondz chose to completely recast them, allowing a new cast to breath life into these characters.As much as I wanted to love this film, throughout it I couldn't shake the feeling of it being a somewhat unnecessary sequel. The plot of "Happiness" loosely revolved around the stories of three sisters, and despite the years that have gone by, the characters haven't really changed much. Joy is still wimpy, optimistic, and drawn to self-destructive, damaged men. Helen is still arrogant and entitled. The only character who seems at least somewhat different is Trish. In the first film, before discovering her husband's pedophilia, she was a smug control freak. Years later, the character reeks of desperation while trying to recreate the "normal" life for herself that she thought she once had.The themes of "Life During Wartime" are also mostly the same as those of "Happiness": trauma, shame, guilt, disappointment, and the part family plays in all of these things. The new film differs only slightly from its predecessor by also exploring the theme (or maybe just the possibility) of redemption. This exploration is apparent in the storyline of Bill Maplewood, Trish's ex-husband, just released from prison. Free, yet dazed and aimless, he wanders through the film like a ghost, having a strange dalliance with a nihilistic woman he meets at a bar (played by the always compelling Charlotte Rampling) and tracking his son down at College. Joy's character also seems to be looking for redemption; despite the fact that, unlike Bill, her guilt is completely unjustified, and she bears no real responsibility for those she feels she failed (two self-destructive, and ultimately suicidal, boyfriends).Mostly, what saves the film from redundancy are the performers, and some of the casting choices are truly inspired. Shirley Henderson, Allison Janney, and Ally Sheedy all do well inhabiting, and breathing some fresh life into, the characters originally played by Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson, and Lara Flynn Boyle. And some of the choices made for the supporting cast are phenomenal ... one example being Paul Reuben's ghostly re-interpretation of the character originally played by Jon Lovitz.Overall, I think Todd Solondz would have been better off exploring some new characters. But by bringing a fresh cast to the table, and at least trying to expand their horizons thematically, "Life During Wartime" manages to come across more as an interesting experiment by a talented director than a redundant rehash.

"Plan B" is a film that manages to succeed despite being built on a premise that seems silly and unlikely. Bruno is jealous of his ex-girlfriend's new relationship (despite that they still see each other for recreational sex). In order to win her back, he plans to befriend her new boyfriend, Pablo, and find a way to destroy their relationship. Instead, the two men end up quickly developing a close friendship and then, to the complete surprise of both, fall in love.Much credit should go to the director, writer, and two lead actors of the film, because somehow the film manages to make the progression of the relationship between the two young men seem believable and natural. Despite Bruno's initial malicious intentions toward befriending Pablo, when the two start spending time together, their relationship has an innocent, almost childlike, quality to it. The two share the unguarded, intimate closeness that many same-sex close friendships in childhood and youth do. The two talk about their favorite childhood toys, have sleepovers, take photos of one another, and just hang out together in the unhurried way that young people do.Unlike most gay themed American films, the film doesn't feel the need to include gratuitous nudity or simulated sex scenes. Instead, the film depicts the characters finding emotional intimacy, which leads to a slow, hesitant exploration of romantic feelings. When the two finally decide to consummate their relationship, the characters close the door behind them ... and the film is all the better for it.

"In the Cut" is provocative director Jane Campion's ("The Piano", "Holy Smoke") attempt at a mainstream erotic thriller. The result is a beautifully executed, well-acted movie that just can't overcome the mediocre material.The performances in this film are all really very good. Meg Ryan, playing totally against type, is terrific as Frannie, an icy, repressed schoolteacher who finds herself caught up in the investigation of a local serial killer. Mark Ruffalo is also excellent playing the creepily charming homicide detective investigating the case, who also becomes Frannie's love interest. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a supporting role as Frannie's doomed, promiscuous sister, and she's terrific as usual (although wasted in a role that an actress as good as she could probably play in her sleep). Ryan and Ruffalo do have good chemistry and generate plenty of heat together.Unfortunately, the script of the film is just not very good. The murder mystery/psychological thriller aspect of the film isn't nearly as interesting as the chemistry of its leads, and toward the end of the film the story descends into typical, by-the-numbers serial killer fare, complete with a cartoonish, evil villian and all.It's a shame that such a great director, working with fine actors, didn't have better material to work with.

At its core, "Stone" is about moral ambiguity. There are no heroes or villains or "good guys" and "bad guys" in this film. Each of the four main characters is morally gray ... seemingly capable of noble intentions as well as cruelty and destruction.The first scene of the film is a flashback of the main character, Jack, and his wife when they were a young couple with a young child: and, boy, is it like a punch in the gut. In this short, brutal first scene, Jack's character is quickly revealed: he's a steely man capable of vicious manipulation. Flash forward 30-40 years, and Jack is a parole officer about to retire, still with his wife, played by Francis Conroy (btw, the young actors who portray the young DeNiro and Conroy are perfectly cast), a seemingly upright, church-going, dutiful public servant.While tying up his loose ends at work, Jack comes across Stone, a convict up for early release. Stone is talkative, restless, slippery, and magnetic as many convicts are. Jack and Stone the characters are like a cobra and a mongoose. Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton the actors are equally matched in talent, intelligence, depth, and commitment to their roles. On the surface, it seems obvious what's happening: Stone wants Jack to help with his early release, and is willing to do what it takes, including allowing his beautiful wife Lucetta to seduce him. But there's an equally powerful parallel storyline at work: Stone has an epiphany while watching a man die in prison, and pursues a new religion, which seems to be the beginning of a genuine spiritual awakening. At the same time, Jack seems to be losing his religion, becoming dismissive of the Christian rituals that still inspires his wife, drinking heavily, and oh-so-easily being led into temptation by Lucetta.The film takes on a lot - so if it stumbles a little, it's easy to forgive it. Especially when its two lead performances, as well as the two supporting performances by Jovovich and Conroy, are all excellent.

It's funny how publicity can play such an important role in how a film, or actor, is received. For example, films like "Swept Away" or "Gigli" are crucified in the press, partially because they are, in fact, mediocre or poor films, but mostly because of the overexposure or perceived arrogance of their stars. But a film like "The Butterfly Effect", which is equally as bad (if not worse) isn't nearly as maligned, probably because of the "golden boy" status of star Ashton Kutcher.This film is just a mess. The premise is ridiculous. The script is full of holes. The performances range from okay to awful. (Watching the film you feel truly embarrassed for the talented actors, such as Eric Stoltz, that degrade themselves by appearing in this schlock). Ashton Kutcher's manic goofiness works on "That 70's Show", but while trying to carry a sci-fi/drama film, he appears downright wooden.The only way this film works is as a guilty pleasure. I can't deny that it was almost worth watching once, just to laugh at how ludicrous it all is. Boo!

*** 1/2"You can't know everything about someone and still like them," says one of the young psychics (or "scopers" as they're referred to) who works for a covert government operation in this low-key little sci-fi film. Dialogue like this makes it clear that in this film, by adding unreal elements to the story, the storytellers are really trying to explore truths about the human condition.For the most part, the film succeeds. Joshua (Nick Stahl), who belongs to the group of covert government psychics, has spent his entire life being told that his psychic abilities (dubbed Widmann's Syndrome) will drive him insane by his 29th birthday, after which he will have to choose between being a permanent vegetable or ending his life. Already 28, Joshua has begun to prepare for the end, until he meets Mia, another young psychic not affiliated with his group, who claims to be 31 and doing just fine. This leads Joshua to rethink what he's been told his entire life, and rethink his allegiance to the mentor who he had always believed had his best interests in mind.Despite a handful of action scenes, most of the film involves dialogue and relationships. When he meets Mia and falls in love with her, the film explores how much you have to know (or should know) about someone in order to have a relationship with them. And when Joshua begins to realize the lies he's been told throughout his life in order to serve the selfish and amoral desires of those around him, the film explores how much of what we're told from "authority figures" is just propaganda meant to keep us all in line and productive.The film is clearly low-budget, and the special affects, although used fairly sparingly, reflect that. But the film is really a low-key, thoughtful indie film, not a sci-fi/action film, and because it keeps its focus on the characters it remains worthwhile. Nick Stahl, a long-underrated actor in my opinion, is an intriguing leading man, which also helps elevate the film.

*** 1/2"Welcome to the Rileys" is yet another example of how a film with a merely decent script can be elevated by the performances of great actors.Doug and Lois have been living in a sort of purgatory since the death of their teenage daughter almost a decade ago. Lois has become an agoraphobic unable to leave the house, whereas Doug seems to be just numbly going through the motions of work. When Doug discovers, while visiting his daughter's grave, that his wife has already purchased plots for the both of them, it hits him that, as far as his wife is concerned, the two are merely marking time until death.While on a business trip to New Orleans, Doug wanders into a seedy strip club and meets Mallory, a teenage runaway surviving as a stripper and prostitute. The shattered, lost girl brings out Doug's paternal instinct, and he makes a bold decision to stay in New Orleans indefinitely to take care of her. This decision creates enough panic and desperation in Lois to motivate her to finally leave the prison of her house and travel to New Orleans to talk sense into Doug, and in the process Lois develops feelings for the troubled girl as well.The film's director wisely keeps things understated and simple, and plays to the project's greatest strength, which are the three outstanding lead actors. James Gandolfini gives a sensitive, heartbreaking performance, shedding all of the alpha male mannerisms of his Tony Soprano persona. Melissa Leo, like she did in "Frozen River", offers a raw, brave portrayal of a desperate, ordinary person. And Kristen Stewart, as she did in "The Runaways" proves that, despite her success with the "Twilight" franchise, she is really a gifted character actress, and not a bland romantic leading lady. She holds her own with Gandolfini and Leo, and manages to avoid all the clich&eacute;s often associated with similar characters.Like "Leaving Las Vegas", "Welcome to the Rileys" is a story about the redemptive power of love, even when those involved are broken, flawed, and even hopelessly self-destructive. Although the film's ending may be a bit too neat and tidy for my taste, it did offer an open-endedness that kept the whole film from falling into either of two traps: phony sentiment or bleak nihilism.

This is the fourth consecutive book I've read by Pema Chodron, but this one will have a special place in my heart since it helped me get through a very frightening and difficult experience. There's nothing trite or sugar-coated about this book ... it boldly challenges readers to lean into, instead of avoiding, the experiences that frighten us, and use painful feelings to wake up, grow up, and increase our compassion.

After improving her voice for &quot;Evita&quot; and becoming a mother, Madonna's fans couldn't wait to see the affects on her music. The result? Spectacular. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is the best album of Madonna's career. With her newly improved vocals dressed in liquidy, psychadelic electronica (courtesy of Williams Orbit), Madonna opens her heart about her newfound spirituality, motherhood, and still unsatisfactory love life (this album was made pre Guy Ritchie). &quot;Drowned World&quot; opens the album with the line &quot;I traded fame for love&quot;, and goes onto describe the emptiness of fame. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, one of the best dance songs ever, is about opening yourself up to unity and ecstacy. &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; and &quot;Skin&quot; are seductive and erotic without being the least bit sleazy. &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; are both captivating electro-ballads about love lost. And &quot;Little Star&quot; is a gorgeous and sincere love song to her daughter. Over five years since its release, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; still holds up as one of the greatest pop albums of all time.

***1/2For it's first two strong seasons, Nip/Tuck was one of my favorite shows (and my favorite show not on premium cable). It featured strong performances, interesting characters, and an entertaining critique of beauty, success, sex, and the American dream.Sadly, by its third season, Nip/Tuck had devolved into a hypersexualized, sensationalistic, and juvenille mess. Instead of surprising the audience with the arcs of the characters, the show often just chose to go for cheap, sordid stunts, and the characters, although still played by strong actors, were just going from one outrageous scenario to another without any believable development. Even when the show moved from Miami to L.A. in its fifth season, little seemed to change.The final season, although no where near the quality of the first two, does recapture a little of the show's early glory. Mostly because the characters are finally able to move on from the viscious cycles that they seemed to be stuck in for years, often because of their determination to stay together. Sean has long had a desire to leave the superficial plastic sugery business and find more meaningful work, although throughout the series' run he had always found himself sucked into the debauchery and phoniness of the people around him. Christian seems to finally just be able to accept himself for who he is - a successful, handsome, superficial, and promiscuous playboy. And Julia is finally given the oppotunity to settle down with a stable man who is anyone other than Sean or Christian.The supporting characters don't fare as well as the leads, however. Liz ends up okay, and is finally given the career boost that her capable character long deserved. But Kimber, a woman whose sexual allure had never brought her anything but torment, finds relief only in death. And lost soul Matt's storyline ends in the most bizarre way of all (although entertaining, I'll admit) when the show re-pairs him with the show's best villian, transexual sociopath Eva (Famke Jenson).Overall, the final season served as a fairly dignified send-off to a show that, at it's best, critiqued the dark underbelly of American ego, excess, and desire, and at it's worst, served as a commercial for it.

This film is about the famous painter Francis Bacon, specifically his relationship with his lover George. Francis meets George when George is breaking into his studio to rob it. Francis offers George a deal: he can have anything he wants if he sleeps with Francis. This marks the beginning of their tumultuous and unlikely relationship. Francis, although a famous and respected artist, is cold, sarcastic, and often cruel. Aside from George, his only other relationships seem to be a handful of artistic friends who occasionally hang out in pubs together and mostly take turns putting each other down. George, an uneducated boxer, obviously doesn't fit into this world at all. But it doesn't really matter at all to Francis, who sees him mostly as a sexual plaything, as opposed to a real partner. Surprisingly, George falls in love with Francis, and begins trying to win his attention and sympathy in increasingly self-destructive ways.Visually, this film is very true to Francis Bacon's paintings. It's full of imagery that suggests cages, pain, confusion and psychological torture. As a character study, this film suggests that Francis Bacon was just as disturbed and unpleasant as his paintings.

"Country Strong" is yet another example of how a film with a mediocre script can sometimes be elevated by a great performance. In this case, the performer is Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays troubled country music superstar Kelly Canter. In the beginning of the film, Canter is in rehab following a tragic public meltdown, and is taken out early by her manager/husband, James, who is eager to put Kelly back on the road to reclaim her once stellar career. In rehab, Kelly had become romantically involved with Beau, a younger singer-songwriter, and Kelly insists that her husband allow Beau to open for her on her tour. Since James has already committed to making aspiring singer Chiles Kelly's opening act, the three musicians all end up going on the road together, and the four main characters become entangled in a plethora of romantic and non-romantic drama.Paltrow is no stranger to playing self-destructive, troubled characters (she did play Sylvia Plath, after all), so I wasn't surprised at how well she pulls off her character's messy, volatile side. What did surprise me was how well Paltrow was able to portray a country music superstar. Paltrow, who is Hollywood royalty with a penchant for playing characters with British accents, is as far removed from a country girl as they come. And yet she is absolutely stunning at the climax of the film, when her character performs her triumphant comeback concert, and Paltrow is able to believably portray a superstar singer, wowing an audience of thousands of adoring fans, radiating charisma. It's long been known that Paltrow could sing, but her ability to actually perform as a singer is impressive.Regarding the rest of the cast, the results vary. Garrett Hedlund shows mega-watt leading man charisma as Beau, and handled the musical scenes quite well. But he perhaps relies a little too much on his charm and fails to connect with the character's supposed inner conflicts. Similarly, Leighton Meester is cute and charming and has a good singing voice, but never effectively shows her character's ambition and desire to run away from her troubled past.The whole film has the feel of a higher-end made for TV movie, full of pretty people with plenty of soapy melodrama. The film succeeds mostly as a showcase for Gwyneth Paltrow's acting and singing chops, and Garrett Hedlund's star quality.

I love a good horror film, and I don't often see good ones these days. So many horror films have jumped on the "torture porn" bandwagon, and have replaced suspense, tension, and an exploration of the darkest parts of human nature with outrageous gory stunts being performed on half-baked characters (Yes, makers of the "Saw" franchise, I'm talking to you!)"Stoic" is a horror film in the truest sense of the word, because it is a truly horrifying depiction of the darkest, sickest, most cruel and cowardly aspects of human nature. Four petty criminals (not murderers or rapists, but in jail for minor drug offenses, robbery, etc) sit alone in a cell, going about their normal routine of shooting the breeze and playing cards. When one of the foursome places a bet that involves the cost of an unpleasant act (the eating of some toothpaste) and then refuses to follow through, it sets in motion a series of acts which begin as unpleasant, and quickly escalate into abuse, beatings, torture, rape, and murder.The film does a good job of making the series of events seem believable. The young men are all caged, angry, scared, and, most of all, determined to maintain their reputations as tough and a part of the group. Whenever any of the characters display a slight sense of apprehension or conscience, the other characters are quick to instill in them the fear of the consequences of going against the pack. The film cuts from the showing of the events that led up to the death of the victim with interviews with the three perpetrators following the crime. Ultimately, each of the characters is processing the events in a different way, which vary from cold detachment, complete denial, and sniveling regret.Director Uwe Boll is about to release a film about Auschwitz. "Stoic" was probably good exercise for that film, since it depicts a microcosm of the kind of group psychosis which led to the events in Nazi Germany.

"21 Jump Street" shares little in common with the 80's TV series of the same name that helped launch both Johnny Depp's career and the Fox network. Although the film's two main characters Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) both enter into the same undercover police program that has its officers posing as high school students, "21 Jump Street" the film is really a raunch-with-a-heart-of-gold romp from the Judd Apatow school of moviemaking, with a little bit of classic "Lethal Weapon" style action-comedy-calamity thrown in for good measure.Surprise! The film actually works, and manages to be funny, entertaining and endearing throughout. Much of this has to do with the chemistry of the film's leads. Hill's Schmidt is book smart, but awkward, and Jenko is brawny but oafish. The two originally meet in high school, with Jenko's popular kid bullying Schmidt's nerd, but when they meet again years later in the police academy, they find that their differences actually make for a great friendship.When the two return to high school in the Jump Street program to infiltrate a drug ring, they realize that much has changed over the years. The "cool kids" are now politically correct, sensitive, and eco-conscious, and they surprisingly accept sensitive Schmidt and reject apathetic Jenko. Jenko instead finds his niche with the science nerds, finding their mastery of technology appealing. In this way, the film makes a skin-deep commentary about how subjective and fleeting things like popularity and acceptance can be.But mostly the whole thing is just played up for lots of laughs, with Hill and Tatum showing that they're up for just about anything; including singing showtunes, dressing up like Peter Pan, reciting poems about chemistry, and, in the film's funniest sequence, getting stoned out of their minds on an illegal designer drug while at school. Two supporting actors also shine in the film, Brie Larson ("United States of Tara") as the popular theatre aficionado who Schmidt falls for, and David Franco as the film's politically correct high school drug kingpin. Johnny Depp also makes a brief but pivotal and hilarious cameo in the film's manic climax.

I love a good horror film, I really do - one that really gets under your skin, revealing all the darkest parts of the human psyche, one that builds suspense and dread and ultimately fulfills its purpose by horrifying you.This is the second film I've seen by Lucky McGee (following "May", one of my favorite horror films of recent years). Like in "May", the film introduces you to a central character that seems benign at first, and is then slowly revealed to be a complete psychopath. In this case, the character is rural lawyer Chris Creek, who comes across a feral woman while hunting and makes the bizarre decision to capture her and keep her prisoner on his family's farm, all under the guise of "civilizing her."It becomes apparent very quickly that Chris Creek's only real interests are sadism and control. As far as Chris is concerned, the people around him are his property, and are there to do his bidding and satisfy his desires. His terrified wife and older daughter are clearly disturbed by his new "project" but both know better than to protest. And Chris' son, who he is molding into his own sadistic image, enjoys inflicting pain and punishment on the kidnapped woman as much as his father.The film builds the tension fairly slowly; since there is much ugliness and depravity under the surface of this rural family who have all become good at pretending to be normal in public. Sean Bridges' performance is so brilliant because he really makes his monstrous character seem so normal. Angela Bettes (who played the titular character in "May) is also wonderful playing a character so terrified and deep in denial that it takes incredibly extreme circumstances to finally make her crack.By the film's climax, all the sick secrets of this family have manifested themselves in all kinds of gory and shocking ways. To give too much away would really be a crime, since I think horror fans should all check out this inventive, disturbing, and intelligent film.

***1/2"Understated" is not a word you would usually use to describe a rape revenge film, but "Descent" is just that. Classic rape revenge films like "I Spit On Your Grave" or "Last House on the Left" depict women being horrifically brutalized by random strangers. "Descent" offers something different ... a disturbingly realistic portrayal of a date rape.Maya, a bookish, uptight, intellectual college student, is hit on by cocky athlete Jerrod at a party. Her initial instinct is that he's a creep, but he manages to convince her that beneath his frat boy exterior he is actually a sensitive romantic who's been admiring her from afar. Charming as many a sociopath can be, he gets her to consent to dinner, a drink at his place, and a kiss ... then shows his true colors by raping her, all the while calling her racist names under the guise of dirty talk. Apparently, Jerrod enjoys both physically and psychologically destroying his victims.And destroy her he does. The film doesn't take the easy route showing Maya's trauma. Maya retreats into herself, appearing still and numb while the world goes on around her. She appears to quit school for a while, takes a menial retail job, and starts exploring the world of nightlife, complete with drink, drugs, and casual sex. This part of the film takes on a dreamier, stranger tone, and yet it never plays it as sensationalistic or over the top. Maya is lost and numbing herself, and, like many survivors of sexual trauma or abuse, finding a strange relief in promiscuity.In the film's final act, Maya appears to be back in school, working in a prestigious TA position, when she is shocked to discover that Jared is one of the students in her class. Since Jerrod is one of those sociopaths too unaware to realize that he's actually a rapist, he agrees to meet Maya at her place, and Maya gets her revenge.The highlight of the "revenge" scene is not really what Maya does to Jerrod, but the monologue she delivers to him before doing it. She talks about all her conflicted feelings: blaming herself for not trusting her first instincts about him and letting him charm her out of her good judgment, the fact that she still has dreams about him where he's a romantic hero before remembering that he's actually a monster. The film's final scene is a closeup of Maya face, a tear streaming down her cheek. The film shows that, despite brutalizing her attacker, Maya is not left triumphant or complete ... just a survivor who chose to dole out vengeance, a very long way from happy.

Since this is really a two disc set, featuring a live album and DVD documentary, I'll give my thoughts on each seperately.First, the live album:Madonna's stage shows are so visually spectacular, depending so much on costumes, choreography and video, that the very idea of her releasing a live album with just the music is a little odd. Not that her music isn't great. But a lot of the high energy dance numbers ("Music", "Nobody Knows Me", "Die Another Day") leave her voice sounding winded or grainy, or electronically distort it so much that it sounds unhuman. Only on the somber "Lament" does her voice really shine. The best track on the CD is, ironically, the final track, which is not a live track at all, but an alternate rock version of "I Love New York", from her newest "Confessions" album. The song sounds so much better as a stripped down rock tune that it makes me wish Madonna had released the rock album she was rumored to be working on.Now the film:The film portion is really less a documentary than it is a feature-length commercial for Madonna. Not that it's not, at times, entertaining. But it's far too controlled, edited and polished to offer any true, revealing, raw insight. Even the live performance clips are so hyper-edited that they really look more like music videos. To make a real documentary about this legendary pop icon, Madonna would have had to surrender her privacy and image to a gifted auteur with a vision of his own ... and our girl is just way too much of a control freak to ever let that happen.Overall, this package is probably worth owning for any die-hard Madonna fan, but will probably not be very interesting for anyone else.

I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this film when I decided to watch it, and I was surprised to find that I ended up absolutely loving it.The very title of the film may be a bit misleading, and a better title might have been "Cheri & Joan." The film really focuses on these two characters, as well as the Svengali, Kim Fowley, who puts the group together and both encourages and torments the girls throughout their rise to stardom. The other three girls in the band have very minor roles ... drummer Sandy West is depicted as feisty but good-hearted, whereas Lita Ford is mostly shown as shrill and angry. And since the film was forced to create a fictitious bassist character to fill in for Jackie Fox, that character is almost completely ignored.The film's script is merely decent, but what elevates the whole thing is the trio of fantastic lead performances by Dakota Fanning, Kristen Stewart, and Michael Shannon, as well as the film's intoxicating art direction and soundtrack. A lot of former child stars try playing sexy in order to appear more mature, and it ends up looking desperate. But Dakota Fanning creates a three dimensional character, and she pulls off both the hyper sexualized stage antics of her character, as well as her sullen, self-destructive offstage behavior. Kristen Stewart is a revelation as Joan Jett, portraying all of the character's machismo, passion, awkwardness, and thoughtfulness. And Michael Shannon goes for broke playing his hilarious, over-the-top character that is a bizarre combination of nurturer and abuser toward his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.Now if only I could get "Cherry Bomb" out of my head ...

Since she burst onto the scene in 1983, critics have been predicting the end of Madonna's career. Hah. In her incredible 22-year run, she's released eleven albums of original music (some of it good, some of it great, some of it brilliant, and almost all of it underrated), performed in countless captivating music videos and tours, and managed to combine fine art and popular culture in a way that no one else ever has.After the somber, electro-folk "American Life", which sold millions of copies but was considered a failure (?), Madonna returns with "Confessions on a Dance Floor", 12 songs of enchanting, blissful future-disco that reaffirm Madonna's ability to appeal to the masses without ever just catering to the lowest common denominator.Critics talking trash about Madonna are like dogs barking at the moon. She's an unstoppable force of nature and an artist unparalleled.

I am late getting on the "Mad Men" bandwagon. After watching the entire first season (devouring it more is more like it) I can now see what all the fuss is about."Mad Men" is a period piece; the period portrayed being the advertising world of New York in the early 19060's. Like any good period piece, the costumes, sets, tone, etc. are all faithful to the time period which it is supposed to be set (as far as I can tell). However, also like any good period piece, the characters, fleshed out and fully human, show that no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.The characters in "Mad Men" are all playing the hands they've been dealt. It's entertaining to watch the men of agency Sterling-Cooper enjoying the privileges of being white, male, and professional at the time: at the office they smoke like chimneys, drink like fish, and are free to sexually harass the hell out of every female in the vicinity. However, the series quickly goes beneath that surface to show the complexity behind that seemingly chauvinistic situation. Many of the men, despite all their bravado, are mostly frightened babies, often buckling under the pressures of professional and family life. And many of the women, although seemingly submissive, expertly manipulate their situations to their advantage. Nothing is ever quite as it seems.Even when it ventures into sensationalistic territory, "Mad Men" always maintains an air of dignity that keeps it from devolving into the sad state of many "edgy" cable shows, where the need to shock is constantly overpowering the need for believable character development. I'm hoping that the series continues to take the high road and continue to develop these fascinating characters for years to come.

Madonna is one of the very few music artists who really makes the most of the music video medium. Her videos are gorgeous, fascinating performance art pieces directed by some of the most talented directors in the business. Some highlights of this stunning collection include: Bad Girl (a dramatic mini-film about a promiscuous woman who meets an untimely death, directed by David Fincher), Bedtime Story (a surreal wonderland directed by Mark Romanak), Ray of Light (a groundbreaking, hyperkinetic video by Jonas Akerlund) and Beautiful Stranger (a sexy and goofy video featuring Austin Powers). This DVD is an absolute must-have for any Madonna fan.

What "Horsemen" has going for it is a cast with some very capable actors (Dennis Quaid, Patrick Fugit, Lou Taylor Pucci) and a director (Jonas Ackerlund) who has made some of the most kickass music videos of all time, and, as far as I know, one trippy, strange film ("Spun"). Unfortunately, what "Horsemen" lacks is a decent script."Horsemen" is a serial killer film, specifically one where the killer (or, in this case, killers) is trying to use murder as a soapbox. This has been done before, specifically in David Fincher's far, far superior film "Seven". In "Horsemen", the culprit is actually an organized group of disenfranchised youth, who have created their gang and its baroque performance art as a way to lash out against the parents and society who have wronged them.Honestly, it's all really very silly and derivative. The film fails at being scary, creepy, or surprising (anyone can see the big "twist" coming from a mile away). And ultimately, the film really has little of interest to say about the consequences of abusing or neglecting children, other than that they might grow up to have an unhealthy interest in S&M;, the internet, or biblical prophecy.

"Shame" has been billed as an "addiction drama," the addiction in this case being a sexual addiction. When I saw this film in the theatre, there was a vibe about the audience ... many of the people in the theatre were clearly planning on being titillated, shocked, or turned on by the film. Those people were probably disappointed since, despite plenty of nudity and sexual situations, there was absolutely nothing sexy about this film. Every time Brandon (the central character and sexual addict, bravely and hauntingly portrayed by Michael Fassbender) acts out, it's an act of desperation and a way of numbing the intense pain and alienation that is written all over his face."We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place," says Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, to her brother in one of the many desperate voicemail messages she leaves him throughout the film. The film's "elephant in the room," which is never spelled out explicitly but is obvious throughout every single scene, is that Brandon and Sissy were both sexually abused as children, probably by their parents. As adults, they are both hopelessly damaged. Brandon seeks constant, compulsive sexual gratification but is completely unable to have an authentic, genuine interaction with another human being. Sissy also acts out sexually, but, unlike Brandon, clings desperately and inappropriately to those around her, as well as self-harms (by cutting).It's hard to give this film a "grade." Why? Because it's not a film that is enjoyable to watch on any level. Practically every scene is painful ... you're spending two hours watching two tortured, ruined human beings self-destructing. But at the same time, the film is beautifully shot and directed, and the two lead performances are outstanding. And the film succeeds on a basic level, by showing how childhood sexual abuse can destroy its victims.

Any fears I had about &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; being nothing more than a way for Showtime to cash in on the success and brilliance of HBO's extraordinary &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; series were quickly laid to rest (pun intended) when I sunk my teeth into this well-acted, entertaining and quirky series. &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; proposes that souls not evil enough for hell or evolved enough for heaven become employed as Grim Reapers in the afterlife, put to work extracting the souls from people right before their moment of death, and then guiding them into their personal afterlife (which usually ingeniously takes the form of whatever they imagine bliss to be). The Reapers themselves are all deeply flawed, and yet likeable, characters who have passed away at different points in time, and who have to pay their karmic debt by doing the job until the Almighty judges that they've &quot;met their quota&quot;. The main character, George, played with loads of charm and poise by the young Ellen Muth, is a rebellious, lazy teenager who, despite the rules against it, still watches over her mourning, dysfunctional family. The great Mandy Patinkin plays the Grim Reaper &quot;manager&quot; Rube, and also serves as father figure and mentor to George, goofy British hoodlum Mason, angry meter maid Roxy (the sexy and talented Jasmine Guy) and vain, self-absorbed Daisy. Although the emphasis is mostly on quirky comedy, the series also does a good job of exploring life's (and death's) bigger questions. Overall, a very worthwhile series.

After creating a subtle, strange, seductive and otherworldly debut album ("Felt Mountain"), what could Ms. Goldfrapp and her partner-in-crime possibly do to top it? The answer: to not try to. Instead, Goldfrapp decide to take their music in a completely different direction, and pull the stylistic 180 off brilliantly. In "Felt Mountain", Ms. Goldfrapp positioned herself as a sort of sexy fairy godmother, but in "Black Cherry" she's more of a space-age sex goddess, tittilating you with throbbing electronic hooks and feverish abandon. After hearing both albums, I honestly can't decide which Goldfrapp I prefer, but I know I can't wait to hear what they come up with next. Bravo.

"Personal Effects" deals with a very heavy subject ... grieving people dealing with the violent deaths of loved ones. After his sister's brutal rape and murder, Walter (Ashton Kutcher) gives up his promising wrestling career in order to care for his family and monitor the case of his sister's alleged killer. Through a support group, he meets Linda, (Michelle Pfeiffer)a widow grieving her husband's violent death, and the two become closer when the trials of their loved ones' killers are running concurrently. Kutcher's relationship with Pfeiffer grows from platonic to romantic, and Kutcher also takes an interest in Linda's angry, troubled, deaf son Clay.After "Spread," "Personal Effects" is the second film I've seen recently that casts Ashton Kutcher as a dramatic lead. Like in "Spread," Kutcher is paired with an older, more seasoned actress, and in both cases, this mostly just makes obvious how feather-light Kutcher's presence really is. Kutcher and Pfeiffer have a smidgen of chemistry, and despite their 20 year age difference, Pfeiffer is still so beautiful that there's no doubt that even pretty boy Kutcher would find her attractive. But Pfeiffer is such a far superior actor that Kutcher seems wooden by comparison. It's clear Kutcher is going for subtle and stoic, but the result is, unfortunately, somewhat vapid.Also adding considerably superior acting chops to the film is Kathy Bates, who plays Walter's mother, Gloria, mourning the death of her daughter and caring for her grandchild. Once again, Bates' gravitas make Kutcher seem like an amateur in comparison.By casting a stronger actor in the lead (Ryan Gosling or Joseph Gordon-Levitt come to mind), this could have been a much better film. Until his acting improves, Kutcher should stick with goofy comedy and prank shows.

Early in her special, "If You Will", Janeane Garofalo talks about a recent trip to Starbucks, where an employee asks "You look like Janeane Garofalo. Whatever happened to her?" Well, it's apparent that although Ms. Garofalo doesn't have the ubiquitous film/TV presence she used to have, she is still doing what she does best, which is stand-up comedy. And although her acting chops may have its limits, her comedy is incisive, self-deprecating, bold, honest, and, most importantly, funny.As a huge stand-up comedy fan, I've come to realize that the best stand-up comics possess a courageous willingness to reveal the worst, most embarrassing, pathetic, sad, and human parts of themselves. It's only after exposing themselves in this raw way will the audience permit their ruthless critiques of others, and society at large. In "If You Will" Janeane continues to expose her personal insecurities, vanity, bodily functions, and humiliating experiences. She talks about her past alcohol abuse ("my boyfriend met me when I was still drinking, and so he was under the impression that I was fun and spontaneous"), her overeating, her being often mistaken for a Jewish lesbian ("Whenever people say that, I say 'you're giving me too much credit' "), her lack of interest in sex, and critics who describe her as someone "difficult to love" or "the kind of person you cross the street to avoid."After thoroughly skewering herself, Janeane does spend some time talking about broader issues (politics, religion, the youth of today) and her opinions on such things are what make her such a polarizing figure, and such a target for those who disagree with her. But her riffs on kids hooked on social media ("I am no stranger to narcissism, but at least I have the decency to hate myself"), her religious upbringing, the self-righteousness of her child-rearing friends, and her secret dream of being a highly functioning alcoholic are some of her funniest moments.

More than anything, "Game Change" is a character study; the character in this case being Sarah Palin. The film portrays her as a complicated, powerful woman who was suddenly thrust into the international political spotlight, then forced to deal with all of the pressure, scrutiny, adoration, criticism, and condemnation that followed."Game Change" will probably not please many people, at least from a political point of view. People who despise Sarah Palin will probably think the film is too sympathetic towards her, as she is portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, as a charismatic public figure with the ability to connect with people in a way that few politicians do, and as a person genuinely committed to her Christian faith. At the same time, those who love Sarah Palin will probably think the film portrays her too harshly, showing her as not terribly intelligent, combative, naive, and narcissistic. In a way, the film's greatest strength is also its weakness - it portrays a polarizing figure as a complex, real human being.All character-driven films that succeed have to be cast with excellent actors, and Julianne Moore's exceptional, multi-faceted performance completely anchors the film. Moore's performance was especially critical in this case, because aside from her performance as Palin, there is not much else of interest. Woody Harrelson gives a strong supporting performance as Steve Schmidt, the advisor who first champions Palin as John McCain's running mate and then comes to regret it, but the character is never really fully fleshed out. And Ed Harris, a fine actor, is rather wasted playing John McCain. The character is portrayed as a benevolent, paternal figure, far from the volatile loose cannon he is rumored to be in real life. Palin's family are mostly relegated to being supportive and loving, and the drama of daughter Bristol's pregnancy is mostly glossed over.Aside from being a character study, the film does succeed in making one strong, good point about modern politics: that today's politicians are required to be charismatic and telegenic; more like film stars than intelligent, thoughtful, experienced public servants. Palin was chosen mostly due to her attractiveness, charisma, and her gender (a calculated maneuver to lure female voters). And the film also suggests that President Obama was chosen by the American people for mostly the same reasons.

I have an ongoing love affair with ambiguity in film. I actually love it if a film doesn't give me all of the answers and tie everything up in a neat and tidy bow, like so many formulaic Hollywood films do. "Cache", a sparse and creepy thriller, asks more questions than it provides answers, which, in my opinion, elevates it from being simply a movie to being art.Georges and Anne Laurent are a busy, professional, self-absorbed couple with a pubescent son, who suddenly find themselves being stalked via a series of mysterious videotapes that show nothing but the ordinary scenery of their life, but are accompanied by disturbing and child-like drawings that are reminiscent of an event from Georges' childhood. The result is the revealing of much that is hidden (hence the title) in this family's life, both in the past and the present. It's creepy and unsettling, more so because the sparse direction and complete lack of a soundtrack force you to focus on the nuances of the characters, who are all full of contradictory motives and emotions.One of the most interesting things about this film to me is how completely unsympathetic the main character, Georges, is. Rude, defensive and arrogant, he repeatedly lashes out at whoever is around him every time he feels threatened or on the verge of being exposed. The suspected "villains" of the film are all more sympathetic than the "hero".After watching the film, I'd highly recommend watching the interview with the director in the special features. He doesn't really shed a lot of light on the questions his film poses, but it's fascinating nonetheless.

In the beginning of the film "Life is Hot in Cracktown" a young man named Romeo extends a playful invitation to a young lady. "Come with me ... I wanna show you something." He leads her by the hand down an alley, at the end of which is a mattress on the ground and a group of his friends, who proceed to brutally gang rape her.The film doesn't get any easier or nicer from there. "Life is Hot in Cracktown", the title of which sounds like either a dark comedy or a grindhouse B-movie, clearly aims to show humanity at its most brutal, soulless, and cruel. The viewer is taken on a tour of a poor, inner-city neighborhood, where most of the characters have ties to hard drugs, either through being addicts, dealers, or police officers. The combination of poverty, despair, and drug abuse has created situations that range from bleak to horrific."Precious" was a film that balanced its brutal portrayal of urban poverty with enough humor and fantasy to keep it from being too bleak. "Life is Hot in Cracktown" aims for pure gritty realism. At its best, it succeeds, and at its worst, it seems exploitive and sensationalistic.What redeems the film is the performances. Kudos to Evan Ross, who plays Romeo, for infusing his monstrous, sadistic character with tiny shreds of humanity. When I first saw Kerry Washington in the film, I thought she was basically just playing the same character (a drug addicted prostitute) that she played in "The Dead Girl", until it quickly becomes clear that her character is actually a transgendered woman, and she delivers the powerful, multi-faceted performance needed. In fact, most of the actors, even the children, give their characters the depth and humanity needed in order to keep the whole film from turning into a trite morality play.

&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a very rare phenomenon: a fun, thrilling, exciting action film that also contains a genuinely poignant emotional core.It's COOL when the Bride kicks the crap out of Vernita Green in her idyllic suburban home. It's POIGNANT when she comes face to face with Vernita's 4-year-old daughter after killing her. It's COOL when the Bride beats the hell out of the disgusting orderly who's been pimping out her comatose body. It's POIGNANT when the Bride wakes up from her coma, and, after realizing she's lost her baby, cries out in acute pain and loss. It's COOL when O-Ren Ishii beheads a fellow crime boss at a dinner banquet. It's POIGNANT when an anime flashback shows how she witnessed the death of her parents as a small child.Brilliantly written, acted, and executed, I LOVED this movie. And extra props to Tarantino for not using ANY CGI in this film!!PS Go-Go rules!!!

I had been hearing for a long time what a brilliant CD &quot;Yoshimi&quot; was, but I resisted giving it a listen for a while due to my dislike of their 90's hit &quot;She Don't Use Jelly&quot;. I'm really glad I gave it a try ... this is an incredible album. The CD starts off strange and subdued, but the emotional impact of the songs gradually builds throughout the album. It climaxes with the gorgeous and hymn-like &quot;Do you Realize&quot;, which, I'm not ashamed to say, brought a tear to my eye. Innocent, psychadelic, beautiful and sincere, I highly recommend this album.

After reading two of Pema Chodron's compact and revolutionary books, I decided to jump right into this much more lengthy and in-depth effort, where Pema provides commentary on an eighth-century Buddhist text. The result is a book that serves as a bridge between both the past and the present, and the East and the West.As evidence that "the more things change the more they stay the same", Shantideva's work is incredibly relevant today. Despite a handful of verses that require some historical background, for the most part his work shows that human beings throughout the centuries have not changed all that much. The text, along with Pema's commentary, encourage the reader to embrace love and compassion, and turn away from attachment to transient trinkets and pleasures that only bring suffering.

If you divorce this album from the Purple Rain film (the first of Prince's trilogy of cinematic vanity projects), what you have here is an album showcasing the work of a brilliant musician really hitting his stride. The fierce contrast of the sacred and profane that has characterized Prince's entire career really takes center stage here. "Darling Nikki" is as intoxicatingly raunchy as anything Prince has ever done, but "The Beautiful Ones" and "Purple Rain" find Prince yearning for a deeper, perhaps even spiritual, romantic connection. "Let's Go Crazy" might sound like pure adolescent rebellion at first, but listen closely and you'll discover it's really more about a spiritual liberation. In my opinion, "Purple Rain" marks the beginning of Prince's musical peak.

After the revolutionary "Purple Rain" and the experimental "Around the World in a Day", Prince continues his creative peak with "Parade". Instead of Beatles-esque psychadelia, here we find Prince combining his usual sleek electro-funk with European sounds (clearly inspired by the Paris setting of the "Under the Cherry Moon" film that this album is actually the soundtrack to). The film was hopelessly silly, but this album is anything but. It's everything the best Prince music is: beautfiul, bizarre, sexy, intuitive and groundbreaking.Damn, do I miss the Revolution.

Tim Burton is an imaginative, brilliant weirdo who has somehow found a mainstream audience. So is Prince. So who better than Prince to provide the soundtrack to Burton's beautifully bizarre take on the iconic caped crusader?In the liner notes, each of the tracks on the album are attributed to one of the main characters in the film, offering a musical glimpse into their psyche. In the opening track, "The Future", Batman describes his dark view of the society, and justifies his extreme ways of trying to combat its evils. In "Partyman", the insane Joker provides his own manifesto of fun-loving anarchy. Many of the songs focus on Batman and the Joker's love triangle with Vicki Vale ... not only are they arch-enemies fighting for the destiny of Gotham City, but they're also hot for the same girl. On "Lemon Crush" even Vicki Vale gets a chance to describe her intense attraction to Bruce Wayne/Batman. Finally, in the final cut "Batdance", all the main characters come together to create a bizarre, electro-funk opera.Is "Batman" one of Prince's best albums? No. But it's definitely one of the most inventive and sexy film soundtracks I've ever heard.

Hannibal Lector is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic villians in modern cinema. Well, at least he was ... until this schlocky, cheesy and embarrassing film came along."Hannibal Rising" creates a proposterous backstory of Hannibal Lector as a traumatized child whose sister is cannibalized by soldiers, and then ends up the adopted son/lover of his uncle's Japanese wife. Gaspard Ulliel, with a phony dead look in his eye and his hair hanging in his face, looks like he could have been plucked from any high school drama club. Whoever thought he was ready to fill the shoes of Sir Anthony Hopkins was clearly off their meds."Hannibal Rising" is easily the worst film I've seen since "Basic Instinct 2".

"Rescue Me" is my current favorite show. With so many TV shows that depict the lives and neuroses of modern women ("Desperate Housewives", "Sex and the City"), it's nice to see a show that is, for the most part, so unapologetically masculine. The cast of New York City firefighters that inhabit the show create a culture of crass machismo camaraderie, which, strangely, provides them more comfort and support than their relationships with women or children do.Like other FX series, such as Nip/Tuck, "Rescue Me" is over-the-top and at times completely unnecessarily hypersexual. However, the biting humor and rich characters all usually keep the show from descending into complete melodrama. Overall, it's an addictive, entertaining thrill ride.

Although I have, and have enjoyed, UNKLE's first album, I had kind of forgotten about them until I came across the video for "Restless" on an on-demand cable music video station. I was blown away by the new sound. Although the tone hasn't changed - the music is still dark, atmospheric, and dense - replacing the trip-hop with rock instruments has completely reinvigorated the sound.Aside from this stylistic change, what I love about the album is that, despite its dark tone, most of the songs seem to be about spiritual yearning. On "Hold My Hand" James Lavelle asks "Do you search for meaning?" while on the following track, "Restless", Josh Homme vows to "follow the light to the love." Later, Ian Astbury describes his desire to "burn my shadow away". "War Stories" captures desperate yearning for redemption and connection in a troubled world.

By not casting himself (or a thinly veiled version of himself) in the film, setting the film in London (instead of the usual New York) and casting hotties Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Scarlett Johanson in the leads, Woody Allen has managed to create something I've never seen before ... a sexy Woody Allen film. Intelligent, engrossing and watchable, "Match Point" is also a somber, thoughtful film about luck, ambition, class and attraction. My only complaint is how similar the plot is to one of the storylines in Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors". But I guess if you're going to plagarize somebody, it might as well be yourself.

It's difficult to review this film, because I can't think of anything else I can compare it to. I honestly don't think I've ever seen anything like it. That, in and of itself, is an accomplishment, and a sign of a great film. Another sign of a great film, I've discovered, is that days after viewing it, you're still thinking about it. And not just recalling scenes from it, but still pondering, still thinking about the characters and certain scenes and analyzing them in different ways. This film delivers on that count as well. Four days after watching it, it's still haunting me.I'm not at all surprised by the negative reviews for this film, because it's a difficult film to watch. It's slow, it's subtle, it's non-linear, and it lacks any real stereotypes, cliches, or familiar film elements that viewers can instantly relate to. And yet it's strangely familiar, fascinating, touching, disturbing, funny, tragic, beautiful ... and then you realize why. Because it's real life.

It's a testament to the acting talent of Michael C. Hall that, as soon as I began watching the first episode of Dexter, I was able to completely divorce the actor from Six Feet Under's (my favorite show of all time) David Fischer. Dexter, the character and the show, is based on a interesting, albeit slightly unbelievable premise ... what if a child with murderous tendencies could, with the right guidance, grow up to be a useful vigilante?So in the first season of Dexter we meet Dexter Morgan, a blood-splatter expert and boyish neatfreak who lives a secret life as a serial killer. Taught a strict "code" by his cop father, he will only prey upon victims who are themselves murderers or rapists; usually those who were able to slip through the cracks of the justice system. Although he claims to have no real feelings, Dexter maintains a facade of a normal life, which includes his tomboyish sister and single-mother girlfriend.Besides juggling his double life, Dexter begins receiving messages from another, more ruthless serial killer, dubbed the "Ice Truck Killer", and over the course of the first season the two form a complex and surprising relationship that causes Dexter to completely re-evaluate his life. It's all smartly written, interesting, sharp, funny, dramatic and highly entertaining.

"Tragic Kingdom" put them on the map, and I love the breezy, fun-loving "Rock Steady", but "The Return of Saturn" is probably No Doubt's most artistically accomplished work. I think what makes "No Doubt" such an intriguing band is the juxtaposition of the mercurial, innovative, fleshed-out sound of the band combined with Gwen Stefani's sincere, vulnerable lyrics and vocals. Those two powerful, yin/yan forces really come together beautifully on a lot of the tracks here. While the band explores and experiments with sounds and influences, Gwen adds the emotional core by singing about lost love, insecurities and longing for family. The result is pop music bliss.

As human beings and Americans living in the 21st century, we are taught to be constantly striving for something better: a better job, a better body, a better mate, a better life, etc, etc, etc. This book challenges that way of thinking and encourages us to see this moment in the life we have right now as the best possible teacher. Instead of always running toward something "better", what if we learned to really look at ourselves the way we are right now?"The Wisdom of No Escape" is the second book I've read by Pema Chodron, and she continues to provoke, fascinate, and inspire me.

The format of this book is a little strange, because it's not exactly a novel or a collection of short stories, but something in between. The book is made up of a series of vignettes told through the viewpoints of a variety of characters who inhabit the same social circles in Los Angelos. The stories often overlap, and a peripheral character in one vignette is often the main character in another story. In terms of content, it pretty much follows the same themes as &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;: immoral, spoiled, self-absorbed and mostly soulless people living in the early 80's, and having difficulty connecting with or relating to anyone else. This gives the entire book a depressing, bleak tone, but it is also somehow entertaining. Towards the end of the book, a couple of the stories take on a supernatural turn that neither of the other books did, which makes finishing the book worthwhile. Overall, I found the book entertaining, though it is far from being a masterpiece.

"Erotica" isn't a bad pop CD, but I don't think it's Madonna's best. Musically, the album has kind of an early trip-hop sound that's sexy and edgy, but what the album seems to be missing is an emotional core. Despite her tough persona, Madonna's music has always had a warmth and sensitivity to it that seems to be lacking on this CD. Even "Rain", the album's one real romantic ballad, seems a little forced and cold. The album also overuses the kind of spoken word vocals that sounded good on "Justify My Love", but become boring after being used on almost every song on this CD. There are several good tracks: "Erotica" is creepily sexy, "Bye Bye Baby" is a fun dance track, "Waiting" aches of need and desire and "Thief of Hearts" is a nasty dis of a scheming girlfriend. But if you want to hear Madonna at her best, combining cutting edge dance music with sincere vocals, check out "Ray of Light" or "American Life".

I had fun watching "Bad Teacher." It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clich&eacute;s that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.

Peaches is not a woman who is trying to be sexy in the coy, titillating way that, say, (...). Peaches is a vulgar, riotous sexual revolutionary, shoving her crotch in the face of puritans everywhere.And thank God.Where Peaches' first CD, "The Teaches of Peaches", was crass and minimalist, "Fatherf*cker" is a much more diverse and ambitious project. The CD starts out with the track "I Don't Give a ...", which isn't so much a song as it is Peaches wailing "I don't give a f*ck, I don't give a sh*t" over a Joan Jett sample. It's totally immature, but I can't deny that every time I hear it it puts a smile on my face. "I U She" confronts sexual labels with the mantra "I don't have to make a choice, I like girls and I like boys." "Kick It" features Peaches trading raunchy banter with punk icon Iggy Pop. It includes such hilariously choice lines as "Some people don't like my crotch/cuz it's got fuzzy fotch". My favorite track "Stuff Me Up" actually manages to be not just vulgar, but legitimately sexy. And "Back It Up Boys", the most out-there track, sings the praises of women strapping on toys and penetrating their men. What is this woman going to come up with next?

Given that the title of the album is "Chaos and Disorder" and that the CD case clearly indicates that Prince never intended to release this material, except to finish out his contract with WB, I didn't have high hopes for this album. The haphazard cover art also indicated that the music would be a messy, ragtag collection.Surprise! Although "Chaos and Disorder" isn't necessarily the most consistent collection of music, it's not nearly as thrown-together or unpolished as you'd expect. What ties most of the tracks together is the focus on the guitar. Most of Prince's 90's music with the NPG has focused on R&B; and rap, so Prince hasn't rocked this hard in a very long time ... maybe even since "Purple Rain", and it's a welcome change of pace. Thematically, Prince seems to be more spiritually-focused than usual ... in fact, you could probably categorize this as a rock/gospel album. "Into the Light" and "I Will" are practically hymn-like, and "Right and Wrong" sounds like a southern baptist revival. The usually-libidinous Prince only turns up the heat slightly on "I Like It There", but then quickly turns down a woman for being too forward on "Dinner With Dolores." Even the defiance on "Chaos and Disorder" and "I Rock Therefore I Am" is more a critique of a soulless society (or perhaps corporation?) than it is pure rock n roll rebellion. The album ends on a strange, intriguing note with "Had U" ... an amelodic, somber track that signals the end of a relationship ... with a person? With Warner Brothers? With fame? Only Prince knows for sure.

Now that I've seen Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette", I understand the mixed critical reviews. I doubt many people could deny that visually this film is stunning: the costume design, sets and art direction are spectacular. But the 80's soundtrack and languid, dreamy tone are sure to polarize the audience.For the most part, I thought it all worked. This film portrays Marie Antoinette as a privileged, yet controlled and smothered, teenager. Arranged to marry the prince of France, her political survival depends on her giving birth to an heir. Unfortunately, her awkward husband, for reasons that are never really clear, can't consummate their marriage. So Marie Antoinette blows off steam by enjoying her stilted life the only ways she can: by spending loads of cash, partying nonstop and, eventually, finding some sense of purpose in motherhood.Kirsten Dunst gives an understated, yet somehow charismatic, performance as the young queen. And although the film probably amounts to more style than substance, it's still well worth watching.

Hollywood rarely offers honest depictions of poor or working class America. In this way, "Frozen River" is a pioneer film.In the first shot of the film, the audience is introduced to Ray, the main character (played with brave, ferocious realism by Melissa Leo) as she sits outside her trailer in the cold, her raw, middle-aged face shedding bitter tears. Ray's irresponsible husband has taken off with the money they had saved to put a down payment on their new home, leaving her alone, broke, and responsible for her two children.Ray is not a damsel in distress type. She puts on a brave face for her children, her angry teenage son and cherubic five year old, and goes out in search of her husband. By chance, she comes across a young Mohawk woman and falls into a lucrative, yet dangerous, position as an immigrant smuggler.And so it begins. I doubt there is anyone in the audience who can blame Ray for her actions. She's desperate, alone, has children to provide for, and only a menial job working in a dollar store to provide an income. All she wants is a tiny little portion of the American Dream - a decent home for her kids. She's not lazy or stupid, she's just a normal woman trying to survive and take care of her family. So it's heartbreaking to watch her involvement in crime bring more and more anguish and trouble into her already bleak life.As a suspenseful drama, "Frozen River" is interesting and entertaining. And as a portrait of the American underclass, it's unfliching.

The other reviews of this book tend to be of a "love it or hate it" variety. I can totally understand why.I found this book to be fascinating, frustrating, inspiring, depressing, liberating, and frightening all at once. It's certainly not a light, easy read by any means. In order to really get everything I could out of it, I had to read it just a little at a time.I've read several other books by Krishnamurti, but this is probably the most incendiary one I've read yet. There's no way I can sum up, in a review, the revolutionary concepts introduced and discussed in this book. All I can say is ... if you're willing to have every bit of "truth" that's been fed to you during your whole life challenged, pick it up and give it a read.

I'd been curious about this CD for a long time, and was impressed by the single "Lights Out" when it came out, so I finally decided to give the whole thing a listen. My opinion? It's really not bad at all. Lisa Marie is not a technically superior singer, but I prefer her husky, raspy, evocative voice to Britney's girlishness or X-Tina's oversinging any day. The sound of the record is mostly bluesy, textured modern rock with a slight country tinge. The songwriting is honest, autobiographical, sincere and a little dark. It's clear that, despite her fortune and famous heritage, Lisa Marie's life has not been an easy one. Overall, a pretty good debut. If Lisa Marie grows as a songwriter and performer, she might have a shot at being a great musical artist on her own terms.Highlights: "S.O.B.", "Lights Out", "Indifferent"

If ever an actress was born to play a role, Robin Wright was born to play the titular character in "The Privates Lives of Pippa Lee". Wright is a beautiful woman and marvelous actress whose career has perhaps been overshadowed by her marriage to volatile, high-profile actor Sean Penn. So Wright is perfect to play Pippa Lee, a devoted wife and mother whose role as caretaker has overshadowed her own needs and desires.One of the central premises of the film is that people often lead multiple "lives" in one lifetime. As the film begins, the audience sees Pippa as a dutiful, middle aged woman who has just moved into a retirement community for the sake of her much older husband. This transition begins causing rifts in both Pippa's marriage and mental state, and so as Pippa begins to look back on her life, the audience sees that she was not always the conservative, supportive woman she is now. The film shows Pippa's childhood with her minister father and erratic, pill-addicted mother, her time spent as a teenager living with her compassionate aunt and her wild, magnetic female lover, her rootless, bohemian young adulthood, and finally, her romance with the much older man who she eventually marries and has children with. The film cuts back and forth between Pippa's current life, which seems to be eroding, and her previous "lives," to show that, perhaps, Pippa is ready for her next metamorphosis.Although a far from perfect film, any bumps or clumsiness in the script are easily made up for by the film's inspired casting and great performances. Regarding the characters in Pippa's current life, Robin Wright gives a pitch-perfect, subtle, and at turns dramatic and comic performance as Pippa Lee; Alan Arkin is charming as her warm but selfish husband; Winona Ryder gives a comic supporting performance as Pippa's histrionic, back-stabbing friend; and Keanu Reeves inhabits his sullen but good-hearted character well. Regarding the characters who make up Pippa's bumpy past, Blake Livey does just fine playing the youthful, lost Pippa; Maria Bello brings gravitas to her portrayal as Pippa's unstable mother; Julianne Moore's considerable acting chops allow her to morph perfectly into the role of Pippa's aunt's charismatic lover; and Monica Belluci brings just the right combination of strength and torment to the role of Pippa's husband's first wife.

Of the three Margaret Cho one-woman-shows I've seen on DVD, including "I'm the One That I Want", "Notorious C.H.O." and this one, "Revolutions" is my least favorite. I just didn't feel that the show flowed smoothly. It seemed a little disjointed, unfocused, and maybe even a little uninspired. Her previous two shows both seemed to have a central theme: "I'm the One That I Want" being about a journey to self-acceptance and "Notorious C.H.O." being about sexual politics. "Revolutions" seemed to be sort of a rehash of territory already covered in her two previous shows.All that being said, I still enjoyed the show. There were some extremely funny moments (my personal favorite being Margaret talking about dancing on Dr. Atkins' grave with two loaves of bread). And I also found Margaret's closing remarks about speaking your truth as a way to empowerment and liberation inspiring. Even if this isn't Margaret at her best, Margaret is still doing what very few comedians, artists or human beings in general have the guts to do: baring her soul in a completely raw, honest and courageous way.Aside from the show, one of my favorite things about the DVD was one of the special features, which shows Margaret speaking at a rally for gay marriage taking place at the capital building of California. Margaret's commitment to civil rights is inspiring and should be commended. So although "Revolutions" may not show Margaret at her best, I'm still a fan for life.

Like a David Lynch film, "The Audition" does not give you all of the answers, and is open to interpretation. Part romantic comedy, part horror film and part surreal thriller, "The Audition" is full of surprises.Aoyama, a lonely, workaholic single father, is still recovering from losing his talented wife seven years ago. After confessing that he'd like to marry again, he lets a smarmy friend convince him to use a film audition to pick out a potential wife. He's instantly attracted to Asami, a former ballerina who he senses has lived through pain and loss like he has. They begin a hurried love affair, and Aoyama is ready to propose before they spend their first night together. However, Asami disappears during the night, and the film takes a completely bizarre turn.My interpretation is that Aoyama is a man who has learned to equate love with suffering. Losing his wife has left him an emotional cripple, so in his dreams (or fantasies) his new love, Asami, who appears sweet and gentle, is actually a twisted sadist who will torture and cripple him as well. The disfigured cripple in the sack is Aoyama himself.However, like any true work of art, the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions.

The central character in "There Will Be Blood", oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (played by thoroughbred thespian Daniel Day-Lewis) is a fascinatingly repugnant character. He's greedy, ruthless, cruel, and shamelessly manipulative, to be sure ... but it's really the touch of humanity he occasionally displays that truly makes him tragic, because you can see that beneath all his contempt is a sad, broken-hearted man. Although capable of affection, whenever Daniel feels abandoned or betrayed he reacts viciously and often violently, destroying any possibility of authentic relationships.Throughout the movie his character's fate is tied to that of Eli Sunday, a theatrical minister who, despite superficial differences, is as ruthlessly ambitious as Plainview is. Sunday is Plainview's nemesis and mirror ... their mutual hatred is due to the fact that they surely see all of their own loathsome qualities reflected in the other. Throughout the film the two characters spar, compete, play mind games and torture each other.Although the film ends with a final confrontation between the two characters in which one apparently "wins", powerhouse director P.T. Anderson makes it clear that there are no real winners in this film, just empty characters who sold their souls to the devil long ago. "There Will Be Blood" is an indictment of human nature, the destructiveness of anger and greed, and the American Dream gone horrible awry.

"The Kids in the Hall" played a significant role in the molding of my adolescent psyche. I have fond memories of watching the show, which aired throughout my high-school years, with friends and laughing hysterically, often quoting the show in conversation later.Flash forward 15 years or so, and I just bought the first season on DVD. As far as I'm concerned, the skits have lost none of their punch over the years. The comedy never really revolved around satirizing current events, the skits were always more of a droll commentary on society in general. So the humor still resonates almost twenty years later: Kathy and Cathy still portray the mundane and backbiting culture of office life, Fran and Gordon are still your quintessential suburban parents, and Buddy Cole is still a brilliant parody of the gay community.In my opinion, "The Kids in the Hall" is probably the best sketch comedy show of all time.

Oh dear.For the record, I liked the "Sex and the City" show, which chronicled the lives of four single (mostly 30-something) women in New York City. Although the women were all successful upper-class types, which allowed for the show to feature plenty of fashion and frivolity, the characters were always portrayed as human beings who had real problems that made them relatable. The show ended gracefully after, I think, 7 seasons, without wearing out its welcome as so many TV shows do, and allowing the characters to seem to be embracing more mature relationships and lifestyles.Flash forward five years, and viewers were presented with the first SATC film. It was a commercial success, but creatively, I found it to be redundant and mediocre. Flash forward two more years, and the second SATC film goes far past redundant and is just plain offensive.The main characters, once upper-class yet relatable, are now ridiculously spoiled and self-centered. Carrie, once a free spirited columnist, now lives in a posh penthouse with her husband, John. Carrie's biggest problem is that John wants to stay home and have take-out after work, instead of accompanying her to a premiere. Also, she is upset that John gave her a big screen TV for their anniversary instead of a piece of jewelry. Poor, poor Carrie. Charlotte is now married to an attorney with two children. Not only does Charlotte not have to work outside the home, but she also employs a full-time nanny. Yet in Charlotte's most emotional scene, she cries about how overwhelming motherhood is. I'm sure all the single, working-class mothers in the audience could feel her pain. And then we have Samantha. Samantha's character has always struggled to accept herself for who she is - a successful woman who was just not meant for a conventional monogamous relationship. Sadly, in this film, her character has become a parody, not an icon of empowerment. She's outraged when a salesperson at a boutique suggests that a dress is perhaps age-inappropriate, and then wears the dress to a red carpet event where she runs into Miley Cyrus, wearing the same dress. And this is supposed to suggest what, exactly ... that's it's empowering for a woman over fifty to still be trying to dress and behave like a teenager?Somehow, the film makes some excuse for the four, downtrodden heroines to take a free trip to Abu Dhabi. As if the film weren't already offensive enough, now the girls are off to the Middle East, where they expect another culture to embrace their materialism and brash sexuality, and are shocked when it doesn't. Oh, and Aidan shows up for no apparent reason, other than to rehash a storyline that was supposedly resolved 7 years ago.Please, please, please, stop beating this dead horse.

This is a beautiful album, which shows that when it comes to music, sometimes less is more. Most of the songs are built around simple acoustic guitar strumming, rudimentary piano chords, and Chan Marshall's raw, intimate vocals. The result is emotional, evocative, and personal. Some standout tracks include "Good Woman" (which features intriguing uncredited backing vocals by Eddie Vedder), "Werewolf", a haunting tune enhanced by a well-placed cello, and the mournful "Names", which tells the stories of a handful of abused or neglected children Chan has known in her life.

***1/2When Kevin Smith's first low-budget, subversive classic "Clerks" was released, he was immediately hailed as a fresh new talent specializing in raunchy, irreverent, slice-of-life comedy. Over the years, his films showed some ambition and willingness to expand his horizons, while exploring issues such as the fluidity of sexual identity ("Chasing Amy") and religion ("Dogma"). With "Red State", Smith makes a huge tonal and stylistic shift, making a film unlike anything he's ever done before. "Red State" is an intense, violent, dark film that shows how extremism, bureaucracy, and arrogance can lead to chaos, destruction, and tragedy.The film starts off in a small town, where the Five Points Trinity church (a cinematic stand-in for the notorious Westboro Baptist Church) resides, and is currently picketing the funeral of a gay teen. The plot begins as a trio of randy teenage boys set out to meet an older woman they met on the internet for some no strings attached sex. As is so often the case in horror films, the teenagers are quickly punished for their libidos, when the woman turns out to be the daughter of the Five Points Trinity church's leader, and the boys are drugged and kidnapped in order to be used in the church's twisted fire-and-brimstone rituals.When a local sheriff comes to the church looking for the boys, and is murdered, a Federal Agent (John Goodman) is assigned to deal with the situation, and that's when things start getting really violent and messy. The church has been stockpiling weapons for a while, and what results is a Waco-reminiscent standoff between the church and the federal agents that results in a tragic, escalating body count.Smith takes a giant creative leap with this film, and occasionally the film stumbles while trying to take on so much. But two of the lead performances help anchor the film: Michael Parks, as the church's leader, offers a portrayal of malignant narcissism masquerading as religious zealotry. And John Goodman, who plays the dutiful, pragmatic federal agent in charge, offers an equally weighty portrayal of a resigned, morally ambivalent bureaucrat. Unfortunately, some of the other characters don't gel as well: Melissa Leo, one of my favorite actresses, is given little to do as the reverend's shrill, obedient daughter, and the reverend's granddaughter's inexplicably lucid character is never really believable.Overall, though, this is a weighty psychological horror/thriller that shows how fanaticism and arrogance, whether in the form of religion or government, can result in horrific consequences.

With "Nip/Tuck" Ryan Murphy created a television show that supposedly revolved around the lives of two prominent plastic surgeons. The show, however, more often seemed more like a psycho-sexual horror story than it did a medical drama. So it was only logical that, for his next show on F/X (let's not even bring "Glee" into this conversation, alright?) he would just completely abandon storytelling based on any sort of conventional reality and create a show that exists within the loose, unpredictable, and often absurd genre of horror.The first season of "American Horror Story" involves a family of three (Psychiatrist/Father/Adulterer Ben, Wife/Mother/Woman-Scorned Vivien, and Daughter/Teenager/Depressive Violet) as they try to make a fresh start in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, they're not aware that the beautiful and suspiciously underpriced house they bought has a history of various murders, suicides, and other brutality, and is haunted by not just one ghost, but a smorgasbord of the living dead (some malevolent, some benign).Although Ben, Vivien, and Violet are the show's supposed main characters, the most important and powerful character on the show is really the house itself. It's made clear throughout the season that the house is its own entity; drawing people to it, driving them to madness, and then containing them once they're dead. (One of the few "rules" of the show is that anyone who dies on the house's property is doomed to haunt it forever.) Over the years the house had claimed many victims, so the show each week often introduces the viewer to a new character, usually from a distant past, whose tragic fate involves haunting what the neighborhood refers to as "the Murder House." Some of the macabre characters who haunt the house include the historical Black Dahlia, a Columbine-esque teenage mass murderer, a modern gay couple, a severely deformed young man, and a housekeeper who appears as a matronly old woman when living women see her and as a naughty temptress when men see her.Every episode of the show is completely over-the-top, filled with all kinds of outrageous plot twists meant to shock, titillate, provoke, and crack up the audience. The show doesn't rely on slow, deliberate character development, subtlety, or nuance. In terms of quality, it's a long way from "The Sopranos" or "Mad Men." What it is: a loud, freaky, kinky, fun and addictive affair. Although for such a campy show, it does include a lot of prestigious talent: Jessica Lange (who won a Golden Globe for her scenery-chewing turn), Dennis O'Hare, Francis Conroy, and Zachary Quinto all add considerable acting chops to the whole deliciously decadent show.

With Season 2 of "Nurse Jackie," Jackie Peyton has officially eclipsed Nancy Botwin as the most fascinating and complex lead female character on a current cable show. Before "Weeds" started floundering, the show was about a complicated, more or less ordinary woman with both good intentions and some nasty secrets. Nurse Jackie's character (fleshed out by Edie Falco's superb, nuanced performance) offers all that and then some.If the ending of Season 1 had it looking like Jackie's drug abuse and infidelity were going to finally come out in the open, well, not so much. After all, drug addicts are slippery and manipulative people, and in the beginning of the season, Jackie is able to keep leading her double life without disastrous consequences. But as the Season goes on, and Jackie's actions become more and more desperate and reckless, it looks like at least a few of the people around her are, at the very least, onto her.While Jackie's storyline keep progressing, Season Two did a very good job of making all of the supporting characters much more interesting and fleshed-out. Miss Acolytes, a wasted character in the first season, comes into her own as the hospital's thick-skinned, yet good- hearted, administrator. Nurse MoMo's role as token gay and male nurse has been replaced by two much more interesting characters: Teddy Bear-ish Thor and recovering addict Sam. Idealistic Zo continues to grow professionally, and her romance with a sweet paramedic is probably the most endearing pairing on the show. And Dr. Cooper continues to flail about in his narcissistic, yet strangely endearing, way.The characters closest to Jackie, husband Kevin, BFF Dr. O'Hara, and lover Eddie, all go down darker and more complicated roads this season. The cracks in Kevin and Jackie's marriage start showing dramatically, and Kevin starts to reveal he's not the doormat he seemed to be in the first season. Eddie's obsession with Jackie leads him to befriend her husband, and insert himself into Jackie's life in a, frankly, creepy way. And Dr. O'Hara, the consummate professional, seems lost in her personal life, dallying with both Nurse Sam and a female journalist, all the while living in a hotel.In addition to all the drama of the hospital staff, some of the best moments of the series belonged to the guest stars playing patients and family. Although the focus of the series is usually the personal lives of Jackie and those closest to her, the show often works best when it takes time to focus on the kinds of situations intrinsic to working in a hospital ER. Jackie's strong, efficient, and compassionate handling of patients reminds the audience why, despite her many flaws and secrets; she's still a woman worth spending time with.Overall, a strong second season to a strong series.

Suzanne decides to resume her physical therapy career after 15 years, now that her two children with rich doctor Samuel are almost grown, so Samuel hires Spanish handyman Ivan to convert a shed into Suzanne's new workspace. While Samuel treats the working class ex-con with contempt, Suzanne quickly bonds with soulful Ivan, and the two quickly find themselves falling in love.None of this is treated lightly by the film. Both Suzanne (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Ivan are seen fighting their feelings throughout the film's first act. The obvious attraction, as well as the conflict these two middle-aged adults have about these feelings, is written all over their faces. The chemistry between the two characters is not just erotic ... it's clear that these people share a deep affection for one another. When the two finally consummate their relationship, it's not an act of animal passion, but of tenderness.Ivan, although romantic, is too much of a realist to expect Suzanne to leave her rich husband and children for him. So it's Suzanne who takes the initiative. In a shocking moment of clarity, she confesses to her husband that she's fallen in love and plans to leave.Strangely, despite being a story that begins with infidelity, Samuel is the character who emerges as the true monster in the film. Instead of displaying sadness and grief over the loss of his wife, he reacts more like a toddler when you've taken away his favorite toy. At first he throws temper tantrums, becoming violent and verbally abusive, "forbidding" her to leave. In these scenes, it's more clear than ever why, despite the financial security, Suzanne would want to leave this man ... he really sees her as nothing more than another possession and status symbol. Samuel is not only furious that someone he regarded as "his" would dare to leave him, but the fact that Suzanne is leaving him for someone he considers to be so far beneath him leaves him enraged. When Suzanne sticks to her resolve and goes, Samuel uses his influence in the community to sabotage Suzanne and Ivan's ability to make even a meager living, and as their situation becomes more desperate, it leads to a tragic chain of events.The film manages to provide a believable, albeit tragic, love story, anchored by a powerhouse performance by the beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas. Normally stories about characters who find themselves caught up in a passionate and impractical love affair are about young people, so it's interesting to see these feelings believably portrayed in an older couple. In the midst of the tragic love story, the film also explores social class, as well as the sacrifices made for love, family, and money.

Bjork's most recent album, "Vespertine", is my favorite (and considering her incredible body of work, that's saying a lot). On "Homogenic", Bjork seemed like a woman searching for love and contentment, whereas on "Vespertine" she seems like a woman who has found these things. This album is full of seductive love songs ("Pagan Poetry", "An Echo A Stain"), otherworldly lullabies ("Heirloom", "Cocoon") and secular hymns ("Aurora", "Undo") that shimmer with passion and inventive beauty. Bjork is the kind of rare artist that can be experimental, strange and optimistic all while creating songs that her listeners can still relate to. The word "masterpiece" is thrown around a lot, but when it comes to this album it truly applies.

Because of her self-protective attitude and refusal to exploit her looks (the exception being the &quot;Criminal&quot; video), Fiona Apple's second album didn't get nearly the attention it deserved. &quot;When the Pawn&quot; shows lots of growth from her already remarkable debut &quot;Tidal&quot;. This time multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion handles the production (taking over for Andrew Slater, who produced &quot;Tidal&quot;) and the results are fantastic. Exotic instruments and percussion beautifully back up Fiona's husky, evocative alto and piano playing. Lyrically, her songwriting is even stronger (although even more dark). The album seems to be a self-portrait of a young woman trying to take responsibility for her own pain and pathos, and having trouble relating to others as a result. Standout tracks include &quot;Limp&quot; (which makes Alanis' &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; seem tame and contrived in comparison), &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; (a hyperkinetic warning to a would-be lover), &quot;A Mistake&quot; (an ode to the growth that comes from taking the wrong path) and &quot;Paper Bag&quot;. It's been almost four years since this album now, and I'm hoping Fiona hasn't given up on the music industry. Because whether or not Fiona needs the attention of performing, we desperately need real talent like hers.

Adolescence is a difficult time for most everybody, even people lucky enough to grow up in stable homes with loving parents. "Fish Tank" is an unflinching portrait of female adolescence, featuring a character stuck in a situation that is anything but favorable.Mia is an angry 15 year old girl living in a housing project with her mother and little sister. Her mother is more interested in drinking and partying than she is in being a parent, and throughout the film it's clear that she just wants to get rid of Mia, who she is beginning to see as sexual competition. Mia seems to have no real friends in the neighborhood, and with her quick temper, is constantly scuffling with the other local kids. For the most part, she seems completely neglected and alone.One day, a handsome, shirtless man named Connor appears in the kitchen in the morning; a "friend" of Mia's Mother. Mia is immediately attracted to Connor, although she also feels the need to antagonize him since he's invading her territory. Connor appears, for a while, to only have a playful, paternal interest in Mia. However, when he gets drunk one night and finds himself alone with Mia, his true lecherous intentions are revealed.Mia's relationship with Connor reveals a sad truth ... that often troubled young girls are targeted by older men, who use their vulnerability as a way to exploit them sexually. Mia, an aspiring dancer, also finds herself in a similar situation when she thinks she wins a "dancing" audition that turns out to be nothing more than a casting call for strippers. And when Connor betrays Mia after their ill-advised sexual encounter, Mia goes off the deep end, with near disastrous consequences.The film ends on an ambiguous note: Mia is neglected and damaged for sure, but she's also a scrappy survivor. Mia will survive and maybe even thrive ... despite the failure and irresponsibility of the "adults" in her life."Fish Tank" is sort of a companion piece to another film I've seen, "Towelhead" that also explores issues of adolescent trauma, confusion, isolation, and sexual exploitation. However, in my opinion (sorry, Alan Ball, love ya!) "Fish Tank" is the superior film.

Having an endorsement by the hilarious David Sedaris at the top of this book may have been misleading, because this book is not full of the same kind of absurd outrageousness that makes his books such a riot. There is humor in this collection of stories, but overall this book is more of a bittersweet series of character studies of modern people whose lives often take unexpected turns. What I loved about the book is that none of the stories were formulaic or trite at all. The characters all seemed so real and human, full of complicated and conflicting emotions and desires. Some of my favorites included the advice columnist who transforms her corny column into a postmodern confessional, the confused little girl whose therapist father is too quick to label a sociopath, the rape victim who refuses to have a meltdown, and the rich bachelor who falls in love with a uniquely awkward secretary, only to lose her when her new status turns her into a typical society wife. The author treats her characters like sympathetic friends, who she both admires and pities for all their strengths and flaws.

What is it about the life of a dancer? They endure extreme physical discomfort bordering on torture. Their life is one of discipline, relentless hard work, and sacrifice, all for the sake of a career that has, in most cases, a very short shelf life. What drives them?"Black Swan" attempts to get inside the mind of a ballerina, while also creating a trippy, often erotic thriller that even mainstream audiences (not just art movie snobs) can enjoy. It's a tightrope, but Darren Aronofsky pulls it all off brilliantly, making his best film since "Requiem for a Dream", with the help of lead actress Natalie Portman, who gives the most impressive performance in her young career (already full of some impressive performances).Portman plays Nina, a workaholic ballerina who seems finally ready to ascend to the lead role in "Swan Lake". Although, with her virginal demeanor, the slightly sadistic director thinks she'll make a perfect White Swan, he criticizes her for lacking the darkness and sexuality needed to play the role of the Black Swan. In order to give the perfect performance, tightly wound Nina needs to find the Black Swan in her, and she knows she won't find it through the hard work and discipline she usually employs.And so it begins. The stress of finally dancing the lead in a production, coupled with Nina's drive to find the darkness within herself that she's been repressing her entire life, send her on a mental downward spiral. The film plays it all ambiguously, and it's often not clear whether what is happening is real or all in Nina's head. Even the characters around her (her stage mother, the free-spirited rival ballerina, the enraged elder ballerina Nina is replacing) can often be interpreted not as real people but as personifications of parts of Nina's own fractured psyche.Part portrait of a tortured young artist, part erotic thriller, and part head trip, "Black Swan" is one of the best films of the year, and the best thriller I've seen in a long time. Bravo.

"I'm Still Here" is a very strange piece of filmmaking. During the making of the movie, when Joaquin Phoenix was making the rounds looking disheveled (almost homeless), behaving erratically, and telling everyone he was retiring from acting to pursue a rap career, there were 3 main theories: 1) that he was on drugs 2) that the whole thing was an elaborate hoax and 3) that he had just lost his mind. Upon the film's release, Phoenix and the film's director, his brother-in-law Casey Affleck, chose to reveal that the whole thing was, indeed, a hoax, thereby having audiences see the film knowing for sure that the antics on display weren't authentic.So since the question on everyone's mind was solved before the film's release, how does the film stand without the mystery? Kind of so-so. Unlike Sasha Baran Coen's mockumentaries in which he plays outrageous characters meant to expose cultural hypocrisy, Joaquin Phoenix is just playing a version of himself ... which makes his erratic, self-obsessed, and spacey behavior in the film less riotous than it is just uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, he gives a brilliant performance, one that satirizes the modern celebrity who is self-important, lacks perspective and self-awareness, and has convinced himself that fame has given him the ability to succeed at anything that tickles his fancy. By pretending to embark on a rap career when he clearly has no talent for rapping, Phoenix is a parody of all the celebrities, especially those famous for not doing much of anything, who "suddenly" think they can become musicians, actors, authors, or entrepreneurs without having any training, experience, or skill. It's just that as a whole, for all its subversiveness, the whole thing fails to be particularly engaging. Sensing this, it's almost as if Casey Affleck felt the need to add just enough shock-value stunts to the outing (gratuitous male nudity of Phoenix's assistant, Phoenix doing drugs with hookers, etc.) to keep the audience engaged.So as a subversive satire and showcase for Joaquin Phoenix's acting chops, the film succeeds. Unfortunately, it's only sporadically entertaining. Which is why I'm giving the whole strange, audacious thing 3 stars.

I liked the first "Hostel" movie. It was gratuitous, to be sure, but it also had a political subtext to it, where the young men who go off to Europe in order to exploit the culture end up being the ones exploited.Although "Hostel part II" picks up right where the last one left off, any political subtext is gone from this film, and it really plays more like another sequel in the "Saw" franchise, where gory stunts take the place of real suspense. Even the characters seem to be borrowed from better films ... Heather Matarazzo basically plays a grown up version of the tragic outcast she played in the groundbreaking "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and Bijou Phillips plays the same cautionary party girl she played in Larry Clark's excellent "Bully". The whole thing just feels really redundant.

Despite the fact that I am not a Christian, I found this book to be fascinating and thought-provoking. I have never before read a book that examined the concept of evil through both a psychological perspective and a spiritual one. Normally "evil" is discussed as an abstract moral concept, but Peck actually creates a concrete definition of it that I found satisfying. What I also respect about Peck is that he is a person who identifies himself as a Christian and yet is still able to see validity and meaning in ideologies that are different than his own. As a medical doctor, he also doesn't seem to believe that religion and science are necessarily at odds with one another, as so many Christians seem to.My only criticism of the book is that a couple of the case studies of evil people in the book seemed to be based upon little more than Peck's gut feelings and the limited time he spent with them. However, the case studies where he actually treated the patients for an extended period of time are fascinating, and his case study of group evil based upon the actions of a group of soldiers in Vietnam is excellent. Overall, a worthwhile and interesting read.

This film has a promising premise: a mentally ill son of an aristocrat tries desperately to prove his worth to his parents by taking care of his invalid mother while his father is away, with disastrous consequences. Unfortunately "The Living and the Dead" takes this promising concept and ruins it with a convoluted storyline and pretentious, overdone editing. Also ruining any chances for the film's success is the portrayal of the main character, James (the mentally ill son.) In order to work, the character needed to be both fragile and endearing and terrifyingly insane. Instead, he just comes across as silly and irritating. In fact, he sort of reminds me of the titular character in "Drop Dead Fred".The film does have a handful of genuinely disturbing moments. Most of them involve James trying desperately to care for his mother, but only managing to abuse and humiliate her in the process. However, most of the film just evokes a mood of shrill hysteria, and I lost interest in the whole thing about halfway through.

It's amazing how Garbage has always been able to align itself with trends in popular music, while still maintaining artistic integrity. Their first album combined elements of grunge with the emerging trip-hop scene, "Beautiful Garbage" coincided with the more pop-oriented sensiblity around the turn of the millenium, and now "Bleed Like Me" finds Shirley and the gang cultivating a more traditional, stripped-down rock sound. Luckily mercurial Shirley Manson seems to carry off stylistic changes effortlessly, and so do her top-notch producers/bandmates. Even as the music evolves, the tone always stays pretty much the same: Garbage's music always comes across as sexy, edgy, glamourous and darkly beautiful. Although "Version 2.0" is still my favorite Garbage album, and "Beautiful Garbage" was a more playful, diverse effort, "Bleed Like Me" is a solid rock album, and maintains Garbage's high creative standards.Highlights: "Bad Boyfriend", "Why Do You Love Me", "Happy Home", and the incredible title track "Bleed Like Me", which is easily one of the best songs they've ever recorded, and destined to become a rock classic.

"Die Mommy Die" is clearly not a comedy that will appeal to everyone, especially the prudish, homophobic, or those not willing to look past lapses in continuity for the sake of outlandish comedy. But for the rest of us, "Die Mommy Die" is a blast.Writer/actor Charles Busch, with tongue planted FIRMLY in cheek, parodies "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane", soap operas, 60's counter-culture, and probably a hundred other aspects of popular culture with a splash of irreverant, crass sexuality. Along for the ride is indie actress Natasha Lyonne ("But I'm a Cheerleader"), Jason Priestley (poking fun at his own reputation), and "Six Feet Under" alums Francis Conroy and Stark Sands. Although maybe not as uproarious as "Psycho Beach Party", "Die Mommie Die" is a sharp and very funny film.
