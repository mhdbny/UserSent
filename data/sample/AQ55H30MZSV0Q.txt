Better than more expensive holsters that I have purchased, my only complaint is that the strap that holds the phone in place is a bit too wide for the antenna on my phone. It fits but would fit better if narrower.The holster does not swivel but I knew that when I purchased it.Too bad the shipping cost is more than the holster.

Brokaw's book has interesting information about individuals who came of age to fight in World War Two. But his premise that they are &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is wrong. If he had more knowledge of American History he would realize that EVERY generation, at least from the Revolution through World War Two, and, particularly, those that fought in the Civil War and in World War One, shared all of the characteristics that he attributes to the World War Two generation. This shouldn't detract from the stories he presents but a more accurate analysis would define how the generations that followed World War Two have changed from the preceding generations. That, it seems to me, is the point he is really trying to make.

Less engaging than "Jerry of the Islands" but a good read. A must for Irish Terrier owners.Caution, this is London's expose of the brutal training methods used by the trainers for the animal acts of the time. Half the book is descriptions of the typical abuses, some suffered by Michael, some by the animals around him.This was London's last book and he was sick, tired and depressed during this time of his life. It's not among his best but it is powerful stuff, as is all of London's writing.

This is London's expose of the training used for animal acts of the day, which starts in the Soth Pacific, using his South Seas experiences. London was sick, tired and depressed during this period of his life and it is not among his finest writing but is powerful stuff, as is all London.

I bought this at Whole Foods without carefully reading the deceptive label. It is 100% juice but not 100% Papaya juice. It is 100% juice: Papaya AND Apple.100% pure Papaya juice is recommended for people with health problems that produce too much phlegm. This isn't it.

I bought this after using her original HP Books "Crockery Cookery" for several years. Most of the recipes that I have checked remain unchanged. A few of my favorite recipes have been changed, for the better, reflecting changes that I made either to taste or from consulting other recipes, so that's good. On the other hand, a few recipes have been deleted and new recipes added. I haven't tried the new ones and miss some of the deleted ones. Overall, if you are buying, used, I'd go with the revised version. However, because my old version has many of the recipes updated, by me, because I'm thinning out my library, I'm getting rid of this one. The old one has many more photographs of the dishes, the new one is organized with one recipe per page and looks more like a cook book.Overall, there are many recipes that don't appeal to me. at all, in both books.I also have "Betty Crocker's Easy Slow Cooker Dinners" and find that I've found more of the recipes from there to be worth repeating than from Hoffman's books.

I read this when it first came out and hated it. I could not understand what the fuss was about so continued my excruciating reading to the bitter end. The main character is repulsive and un-engaging. Twenty years later a very intelligent and witty friend told me that it was his favorite book and I read it again to see what I'd missed. Nothing. I now think considerably less of my friend.

Not very well written but interesting, none the less. Given Kayla's education and background I was surprised to see how awkwardly written the book is, even more surprised when I realized it was "ghost written". Disappointing in how little detail she gives as to what she actually worked at most of the time but, nonetheless a different perspective on the war and on the Army. I also agree with some of the other reviews' criticisms. I would recommend borrowing this book from the library, it's not a keeper.

I, too have undergone treatment for throat cancer. At different stages liquid nutrition is all that I could or can manage. This is my favorite flavor and is impossible to find locally. I can't consume chocolate or coffee so my options are limited.Before radiation treatment I preferred Scandishakes which have more calories, are powdered, you make them with real milk and they taste more like real milkshakes, however, after radiation with a sore throat I found that the Scandisahkes, even with almond milk as a substitute for real milk, aggravated my sore throat.I've tried Boost, CVS' copy and a Carnation product (in vanilla flavor) and like the flavor and consistency of Ensure the best.

As noted by other reviewers, the author has a forward where he pats himself on the back for the extensive research he has done with primary sources that other Patton biographers haven't. But most of the sources prove to be a waste of time. The detailed material he provides about the Patton's ancestors is completely irrelevant to an understanding of the man, it is filler that could be greatly abbreviated. We really don't need to read quotes from letters they sent each other.The author also pads the book by repeating, word for word, quotes or paragraphs contining conclusions he has made in diffgerent parts of the book. Does he really think we've forgotten what we've already read? His writing is also strangely stilted at times, using verb and adjectives that don't seem to fit the context of the paragraphs.I was not offended by the opinion that Patton's irrational, hyperbolic pep talks to the troops encouraged the atrocities that they committed, I think that it is a fair conclusion and part of Patton's character as shown by other statements, acknowledged by other biographers, and Patton, himself. He shot off his mouth without thinking.Another flaw of the book is the maps. The author gives great detail about the places attacked, passed through, avoided, etc. but the maps show only the larger towns.The author's conclusion is that Patton was a great tactical general with many character flaws, which seems to be an accurate assessment.It just isn't a well written book.

I acquired this book in high school or college and never read it. I kept it around because it appears on lists of must read books. God knows why, the footnotes are an interesting chronology of American history but Adam's false humility, while name-dropping references to art, literature, economics, politics, statesmen, etc. but never discussing any of these areas becomes extremely tedious. I struggled through to the end but never could discover a reason to read the book or a reason why the book is touted so highly as necessary to be truly "educated". Adams, himself, would have been a fascinating person to know but he is a colossal bore to read.

Pullman's writing is very vivid and there are some very interesting concepts but the books reach a lame conclusion which ignores most of the concepts raised. I like S.F.that has intellectual themes and carries them out to reasoned conclusions, which Pullman doesn't. "The Amber Spyglass" seems like filler.

This is a good-looking, easily readable wall clock. At night, when all is still, this clock can definitely be heard ticking (actually, more of a "tock"). The clock is in our bathroom, but, in the contemporary style, our bathroom is off the Master Bedroom without a door. The tocking can be heard 40' away in bed. Previous atomic clocks which I have owned of other manufacturers have not ticked at all.I haven't had this clock long enough to know whether or not it will automatically change for Daylight Savings but the instructions say that it will.I've downgraded it because the ticking is really annoying. It did change from daylight savings to standard time as advertised.I would not buy it if I could do it over again.

I have throat cancer, am being treated with chemo and radiation and have been drinking supplements to keep up my weight. I've tried "Ensure Plus", the "go to" supplement, "Carnation Breakfast VHC", the CVS knock off, (all three liquids) and a GNC product, "Amplified Mass XXX" of 900 calories recommended by my radiation oncologist. I cannot tolerate the VHC as it is very sticky, slimy, and has a strong, odd taste. Similarly the GNC product has a gluey texture and a strong taste. The "Ensure" is tolerable but this tastes much better, more milky and easier to drink/swallow (I use whole milk with all the powders), has a higher calorie count than the liquids and has 25gms of fiber to help prevent constipation where "Ensure" has none. I add Ice Cream and Egg Beater to increase the calories. I may have to rely on this for six months which I believe is possible, I know I couldn't do so for the other products.Update, 11/2/12: Towards the end of radiation my throat was too sore to eat by mouth and I had to use a feeding tube, When I started to be able to drink food I found that "Scandishake" irritated my throat much more than "Ensure" did so I stopped using it. Because radiation affects many aspects of eating, I can't blame "Scandishake" but did want people to know that under certain conditions "Scandishake" may not be the best for them.Update/ 1/15/13: After drinking "Boost VHC" (formerly "Carnation VHC") because of its high calories, I am back to using "Scandishake" which tastes so much better and has 600 calories per serving as opposed to the 530 calories of "Boost VHC". It no longer affects my throat.

I've had GERD for about 25 years. I've been on every prescription med available and am currently taking Aciphex which barely helps. I tried this because of the favorable reviews and because I'd done some on-line research and found that the active ingredient in "Heartburn Free" has been subjected to scientific testing and found to be beneficial to sufferers of GERD.It has not helped me. The recommendation is to take one pill every other day. When I do I get very painful flare up about one half hour after taking. I have been taking, and continue to take, a probiotic supplement. The probiotic did not work, either- alone or with this product. I will discontinue both once the supply runs out.As other sufferer's have gotten relief, I hope that I am in the minority and that you will get relief, too.

This is a beautifully constructed, solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand, the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?), a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect.

The Flashman series, for those not familiar with it, features a thoroughly despicable, cowardly, womanizing rogue who blunders through history, managing to be present at most of the significant events of the Nineteenth Century. Fraser's historical research is detailed and complete and he manages to teach history in a very entertaining manner. &quot;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.&quot; The research that goes into these books is formidable. Flashman manages to participate in the Charge of the Light Brigade, the Sikh Uprising, England's invasion of Afghanistan, John Brown's taking of Harpers Ferry, Custer's Last Stand, etc. While I have not read all of the books in the series, my conclusion, to date, is that Fraser is much better at presenting British History than he is at presenting American History. Perhaps it is my being less familiar with British History, as an American, although I was an History major in college and did study Indian History. The characters seem more colorful, the plots more complicated, the intrigues more convoluted. My intent is to read the rest of the Flashman series by reading the non-American books first.

Wow! I'm a WWII history buff and have read extensively. Just discovered this book. This book is a gem. It discusses the incompetency and duplicity of our ally, the British, but in a very fair way. Also gives an insider's view of the campaign in France and gives a terrific analysis of the Nazi Fascist system, too often overlooked, in retrospective books, given our desire to incorporate the Germans into the war against Communism. A must read.

This is a trimmer, not a clipper. It's small and fairly silent and is for trimming hair on pets' feet, mainly. On my Miniature Schnauzer I use it for the hair between the foot pads. That hair is very soft and fine and the trimmer takes a long time to cut it. My dog gets tired of having his feet held during the process.More power would be nice but unlikely with battery power. Reviews on other sites complain about short battery life.Check "Pet Edge" for a better price.

I was looking for a weeding tool to weed foxtail grasses at our local dog park. The usual weeding tool which has a bifurcated tip is designed to remove weeds with a single or main tap root. The foxtails have a shallow clump of spread roots. Hammering the tine end of this tool into the weed grabs the roots and yanking on the tool pulls the weed out. I down rated it one star because I wish the steel was stiffer. The tines frequently bend and have to be straightened out. Hitting stones as large as 1/2" causes them to deform. If the tines are too close together the tool doesn't work.

Wonderful cinematography, costumes, settings and locations but a poor and senseless plot.The battlefield "tactics" are absurd, if there was one thing that the British knew how to execute, it was the square. The same tactics had been in use by them for 200+ years.(and used artillery to break up cavalry). Long and boring (interminable ) scenes interspersed. Good talent wasted on an awful plot.

I'd hoped for a John McPhee type profile on John McPhee. Instead this. As far as information on John McPhee, Wikipedia is just as informative. The author spends minimal time and space on McPhee and maximum space summarizing all of his works. He loves McPhee, as do all of us fans, and is fulsome in his praise but we don't need that.I've been reading McPhee for 55 years, I have read almost all of his works. I wanted to know more about the man who wrote them: how much writing for "The New Yorker" affected his style, what other authors influenced him, a day in his life, how he chooses his topics, how he is able to spend as much time as he does on his subjects and how he handles the logistics, what his family thinks about his being away from home so much, etc.This book reads as if it was written for some sort of college English class.

A little corny but a great read for Dog Lovers. The sequel is "Michael, Brother of Jerry". If you like London's tales, especially his dog stories or South Seas stories you'll like this. If you've owned an Irish Terrier you'll know how accurate London is, he definitely had owned one and, from the preface, one very similar to Jerry.Jerry is born on a plantation in the Solomon Islands, accompanies a White Trader and lives among the natives. The book is filled with South Sea Islands lore of the turn of the century before last. Right up there with Conrad and Stevenson for lovers of that millieu.

I have to say that I found the first few chapters hard to take and if this was my first Mowat book I would have thought that he was insane. I don't want to spoil the story so I won't describe why I felt so. However, the book picks up once the voyage begins and Mowat's descriptions of nature (weather, sea, terrain)are unsurpassed. He does good descriptions of the characters that he encounters, as well. Still one of my favorite authors.My understanding is that in later books he becomes disillusioned with the Newfoundlanders and other local types.

Early Hillerman books in this series are wonderfully evocative of the four corners area, one can smell, taste and feel the locale. The characters were carefully delineated, as well, the personalities distinct. This novel feels like it was cranked out to make money, the characters have turned into simplistic cartoon forms. Anyone could fit into the various roles, Hillerman characters or anyone else's. The plot is interesting but that's it. I've always eagerly awaited the newest of the books in this series but I won't spend money on any more until the writing improves. One wonders if someone else has written this for Hillerman

I bought this for Merle's guitar playing and only three out of 50 songs display his virtuosity. He mostly just accompanies his singing. He has a nice voice but his singing style is boring. There is a wide range of his playing, solo, western swing (an adequate group but nowhere as interesting as Bob Wills)and other. I'd give it one star for the guitar playing but figure anyone interested in his evolution in the industry might like the set. There are many songs that I'd never heard before so they are of interest, historically. (Most I'd just as soon never hear again.) Personally I feel that I've wasted my money.

This book is excellent for all the reasons mentioned in the other reviews. What I found REALLY annoying was the author's use of German quotes. He provides quotes, in German, usually somewhat abbreviated as shown by the use of ellipses, and then provides the translation of the entire quote in English. Since most of his readers can't read German, and the entire quote is NOT in the German version, why include them? More frustrating are the German phrases that he quotes and doesn't translate, leaving us to guess at their meanings.

I was satisfied to find how well this novel has stood the test of time. I read it when it first came out but was too young to appreciate it. I just re-read it to see how it compares with current war novels. It is about how the individual characters deal with the stresses of war. The characters include almost all ranks and socio-economic classes. For me he nailed the characters. I feel that I have known many of them, some closely, some not so. The psychological insights ring true, as well. The only character that I felt he grasped at was the scout Sergeant who was a Mexican.The descriptions of the surroundings, the oppressive climate, and the sense of exhaustion had me suffering with the men.The book is a classic but don't read it if you are in a hurry and don't want to be absorbed by it.

This book may be flawed but it shows how conflicted the Japanese system of government and military were.How many other books show WWII from the Japaneses perspective?There's Hoyt's "Japan's War" and it is a must read together with Toland. Toland believes that Japan would have never started WWII if the U.S had made some concessions to it. Hoyt states that the Japanese Army, which controlled the Japaneses Government, wanted war unless all of Japan's demands were met by the U.S., which the U.S. never would have done.Hoyt's book, written in 1986 (after Toland's) and based upon his research into Official Japanese records is probably the more accurate of the two books.

Wow, what a waste of time. Humor, of course, is a matter of individual taste but these are NOT funny stories. Most were not, in my opinion, intended as humorous by the authors- off beat, quirky and interesting, perhaps, but NOT humorous. Even the selections from the true humor writers are the least funny, from my experience of their other works. Very sorry that I wasted my time and money on the book.

This is one of the great ones for the description it gives of rural life and values and is tremendously evocative of a sense of place and time.

American Standard has a line of Americast products, including this. Americast is a proprietary process where metal is coated with enamel and then backed with a dense plastic to give it rigidity. It is lighter than cast iron and keeps in heat much better.I purchased a new home and the kitchen sink and bathtubs were all Americast products and I love them. I'm currently rebuilding a rental home destroyed by fire and I'm trying to use Americast products but American Standard has discontinued Americast sinks so they are almost impossible to find.

I reviewed &quot;The Battle Of The Ironclads&quot; by Quarstein and called it the best book that I'd read on the Monitor and Virginia/Merrimack. That was before reading this book. This book has more source material and, consequently, more detail and is a better text. &quot;The Battle Of The Ironclads&quot; has more contemporary illustrations so both books complement each other in some ways. Despite the additional source material there are strange omissions in Davis' book, for one he does not mention why the Navy Department disliked Erickson: &quot;The Princeton&quot; affair wherein a gun, not designed by Erickson, blew up killing some high govenment officials when tested on the Princeton, a ship designed by Erickson, and Erickson was blamed for the deaths. Davis also casually mentions that the Confederacy was working on an ironclad called the Richmond when the Confederates abandoned the Norfolk Boatyard. In fact, work was proceeding on both the Richmond and Virginia simultaneously and it is possible that the Virginia could have been completed earlier with more devastating affect on the Union fleet if all work had concentrated on her.Davis' work is the more scholarly of the two with an index and list of references. Either one is a great read with much detail and the true student of the Battle or of the Civil War will want to read both.

Great old time gospel but this volume is only for the hardcore collector. Many songs are unintelligible because of the quality, or lack of it, of the recordings. I wouldn't buy it knowing what I now know.

Wouldn't we all love to live in Fanny Flagg's fictional world? She delineates her characters so well. Of course it would be nice if everything turned out well in real life as it does in her novels.I do agree that the plot line of the murder was gratuitous and added nothing to the story.

This is one of the better books by Fraser on Flashman's participation in American History. Flashman is involved with the Plains Indians and the Apaches, both before and after the American Civil War.

Interesting to understand dog behavior BUT she doesn't explain how to apply it to teaching your dog, she only explains how to watch for signs that you are overwhelming your dog. My dog ignores my yawning, licking, blinking and looking to the side. I guess if a strange dog attacks me I know to sit down with my back to it (yeah, sure). I'd love to attend her classes but this book is NOT worth owning. Borrow it and read it.

I really wanted to like this book, hey! Groucho loved it and I love Groucho!I found it so boring that I couldn't get more than a quarter way through it. I skimmed the rest to see if it picked up but nope. I'm a compulsive reader, too. There aren't many books that I don't finish.Sorry, I didn't find the author charming or interesting nor could I develop any interest in the characters or plot. And humorous? No.I can see how the book might have been interesting in the '50s but I can't see how it continues to be revived.

I love the desert, in general, and the Black Rock desert, from the many times that I have visited there. I visited the show of these photograhs at Reno's Art Museum so bought the book without really reading it first as I thought that it would be a good introduction and guide to the area. Big mistake.It is a classic "Coffee table" book, that is, if you leave it on your coffee table and some one picks it up and looks at it for no more than five minutes it is impressive. However, don't try reading it. The text is pretentious, trying to be mystical, poetical and profound but only achieving verbosity. The text is merely an excuse to pad and space out the photographs which are NICE, but not great. Any amateur photographer with a good eye could do as well. Nothing is really spectacular which is strange given the number of years that the author has visited the desert.There is some actual interesting information but the text could be condensed to four pages for a very nice pamphlet on the area.It is the kind of book that a small university press publishes to show how hip it is to its locale.

I became aware of Arthur Train and his character Mr. Tutt when recently I read Louis Auchincloss' autobiography. In it he referenced the series as being one that he thoroughly enjoyed (and which may have influenced him in becoming a lawyer or, at least, being a lawyer who began writing fiction). Train was a lawyer and so is his hero, Mr. Tutt, who cleverly finds obscure legal means to extricate fair damsels, old ladies and other sympathetic innocents from the dastardly, but legal, situations in which they find themselves. I believe that the series ran from 1919 through the 1940's (Train died in 1945) and the stories are set contemporaneously.I understand that the short stories were originally printed in "The Saturday Evening Post" one of the pre-eminent popular weekly magazines of the 20th cenury. It was the most widely circulated weekly magazine and had its existence between 1897 and 1969. Print was then, of course, the most popular medium because it pre-dated radio and television. Popular weekly magazines saw their demise with the rise of television.As a retired lawyer I especially appreciate the author's clever legal solutions which appear to be based on actual published legal decisions.

When this book was published in 1985 the concept of natural training was revolutionary. The Monks of New Skete followed in 1991 with a book advocating the same concept of training. However, the principles of a more natural training method have been greatly refined over the years and some of the advice that is contained in this book is wrong (or wrong in most situations).The author is adament that food should not be given as a reward, reward should be positive attention only. The Monks also believed this but weren't so adament. More recent books have recognized that different breeds respond differently. Breeds bred for close human interaction, primarily the herding breeds, are more closely focused on humans, breeds bred to act independently such as Beagles, and other hounds, and terriers, are not closely attuned to humans and respond better to food rewards. Hey, it's animal behavior 101 that lab rats are rewarded by food and learn from those rewards. Interestingly both Benjamin and the Monks work primarily with German Shepards.Benjamin also maintains that you can bring a dog back to the scene of its crime, i.e. where it destroyed a pillow, show it the destroyed pillow and correct the dog's behavior. All the recent books acknowledge that you can only correct a dog's behavior if you catch the dog while it is in the act.Potentially dangerous advice that she gives is to grab a dog by both sides of the neck and get in its face to stare it down. That is threatening and confrontational and may work with puppies but other books warn against that approach with agressive dogs as it will incite them to attack and bite.There are better books out there pass on this.

As an American History major and life long student of WWII, FDR and the Depression, I find some of Fleming's observations and perspectives to be stimulating.If he was not so apparently biased against Roosevelt he'd carry more weight. He faults Roosevelt for EVERY move he makes. If FDR made a move that was ideologically based, Fleming criticizes him for not being pragmmatic, if FDR made a decision that was pragmatically based, Fleming criticizes him for not being true to his ideology. Fleming also criticizes FDR based on information that we now know but does not credit FDR for decisions that are supported by similar information.One of Fleming's premises seems to be that we should NOT have fought WWII and, while it is good to re-examine our accepted beliefs, the Nazis WERE bad and had world domination aims, the Japanese WERE expansionists, had brutalized their captives and the rape of Nanking was typical of their subjugation of the countries that they conquered. Germany was technologically superior to Japan and if we'd pursued a Japan first policy Germany's technology might have triumphed.While I do not believe that Roosevelt was pro-Communist I do believe that Fleming correctly portrays Roosevelt's self-delusion about Soviet Russia's aims and its totalitarian methods which we all know were equally as bad as the Nazis. However, FDR was trying to get Stalin to commit to fighting Japan so that the U.S wouldn't have to conduct an invasion against the entire Japanese army. No one knew if the A bomb would be successful. It is also clear that Roosevelt had no clear goals for post-war Europe. This may be attributable to his failing health. If FDR's health was truly as bad as Fleming portrays it (another of his major criticisms of FDR), FDR is to be condemned for his egotism in not stepping down, but almost every politician is an egotist and believes he knows best and will act best.How reputable the author is as an historian is uncertain. He has certainly written many historical books but without going to and reading his citations it is impossible to know how accurate he is.The book is certainly thought provoking and that says a lot.

Having read "Last Days of Summer" and having loved it so much that I bought three copies to share with friends and family, I was disappointed in "Changing Pitches", the only other book of Steve Kluger's that I could find. Particularly so because the reviews were all five star. "Changing Pitches" is a "nice" book but it isn't special enough to merit a recommendation. The author starts developing a style that comes to fruition in "Last Days..." but "Last Days..." has a more universal theme and is much funnier, I only chuckled once or twice reading "Changing..." where as "Last Days..." had me, literally, laughing out loud. I had tried to purchase "Changing..." from Amazon but it was out of print so I special ordered it through my library from another library and I was glad I did because it isn't worth purchasing.

Miniature Schnauzers are prone to teeth problems so I've been concerned about keeping my two's teeth cleaned. Annual cleaning by a Vet is one way, brushing their teeth is supposed to help and is Vet reconmmended, but is a real chore and didn't seem to help much. I tried this product for four months and my boys' teeth are pearly white. I finished the small size and purchased the largest. This stuff isn't cheap but it's cheaper than Vet bills!It isn't available at Pet Edge, Petco or PetsMart so you might as well buy it here.All our dog park friends are impressed and wanted to know the name of the product.

I saw on television part of a lecture the author gave at UC and was very impressesd with him and wanted to read his book. The highlights of his life given in the lecture covered the only interesting parts of the book, his childhood. The book is poorly written which might be acceptable if he wrote it alone, but he didn't, he had help. His childhood experiences growing up in a segregated society are interesting and his perspectives on segregation are, too, but once he graduates from law school he moves from one position to the next, seemingly moving up by being the right person in the right place at the right time knowing the right people. He must have been capable and a hard worker to handle those positions and, clearly, he learned people skills but there is nothing to indicate his thoughts or positions on any of the issues with which he was confronted except in the most general way. Nothing comes across as showing him as being inspiring, charismatic, or even interesting other than his being where he was, with the people he connected with and the times he participated in. The people he dealt with were giants, Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley as two examples in the legal profession, but he gives no insights into any of these people or even interesting anecdotes. Just a list of who they were. His reportage of his contacts with the Clintons, early on, after Bill lost his bid for re-election to the Governorship was that he told them that Hillary should stop using her maiden name and start using Clinton and when she did Bill got re-elected. There is absolutely no sense of the man, or of his contemporaries or, even, really, his times. Having lived through most of them, myself, I can place his story in the context of the times but for younger readers without a sense of the historical context it can't seem very inspiring. I'm glad I didn't buy the book but only borrowed it from the public library.

Ingersoll worked for Time magazine and then was the Editor of PM magazine, He's an excellent writer and accompanied the Rangers on combat assignment in North Africa. He served as an officer in the engineers, not as a correspondent but wasn't permanently assigned to combat units. The book was written during the war to give the public "back home" a real view of what makes an army a successful army. Remember our army essentially started from scratch in WWII and was mostly draftees.

My review is generic, i.e., it is for all Weathertech mats not for the specific mat listed.So are the mats. They are not "One size fits all" but, rather, "several sizes come close to fitting all". In other words, the mats I got do not fit the specific contours of my footwells but they come close. Not what I expected from the ads but better than I'd find at Walmart or Kragen type stores.

This is a beautifully constructed grill made from heavy duty materials. I found it to be very elegant looking. Assembly was easy as all the major components are already assembled so it is just a matter of attaching the sub-assemblies. The fitted cover is heavy duty and superb.I was disappointed with the performance, however. Despite having a smaller grill surface and lower hood than my old, cheap, Fiesta grill, which should equate to higher temperatures, the cooking times were longer on the Minden. Also the grill had very uneven temperatures. Three hamburgers, placed in a line, front to back, would all cook differently.I live in Nevada and had wanted to support a local company. I called them and they said they'd inspect it to check whether or not it was operating properly. They did and said it was. I told them I was not happy with its performance and they arranged a full refund. So customer service is excellent.I also did not like that there was practically no vertical lip at the back of the grill to back-stop hamburgers if you try to pick them up with a spatula (and need to slide them into something) and the control knobs do not have clock face hash marks to line up against to indicate amount of heat, rather an expanding arrow making it difficult to finely adjust the heat settings.I would recommend getting one from a dealer with a liberal return policy but understand that it will be difficult to re-pack to return it if you have it shipped to you.

I am fascinated by the lives of the great criminal defense lawyers and the trials in which they participated. Clarence Darrow is one of my heroes and I've read much about him. I recently became aware of Darrow's peer, Earl Rogers, and was eager to learn about him. The first 50 pages of this book are very hard going, It is more about the author than about her father. I really don't care what her relationship was with her mother, nor do I want to know the details of it. Nor do I care what the author was thinking as a child when she accompanied her father when he was dealing with his cases, or care about her detailed relationship with her father when he wasn't dealing with his cases. Her overly dramatic style is also off putting.It does pick up after that, with less of the author and more about her father. However her writing style is very convoluted. I have "Defenders of the Damned" on order. It covers Darrow, Rogers and William Fallon's cases. I'm hoping that it'll cover her father's career in a more linear and clear fashion.

I've used Motorola FRS Radios in the past but got a good buy on these Cobras and they are supposed to have better range. Used them on three occasions with minimal actual use. Took them out this season and found that one receives but doesn't send, the other sends but doesn't receive. Of course they are out of warranty. Two out of two defective radios does not inspire me to try the brand again.

The biggest disappointment is that Greer does not write about the most interesting parts of the Monitor's history: the trip down to Hampton Roads and the battle with the Virginia. He mostly writes about his shipboard life and details his illnesses and money making schemes done to augment his pay which was not paid out to him in full thus causing financial hardship at home. Mostly of interest for its insights into a sailor's life, less so for info on the Monitor. It's a decent book to supplement other info on the Monitor but not the book to get if you get only one.

I read a review of this book in "The Week" and, because I'm turning 69, I thought I'd see what the author had to say as the book sounded good. I was very disappointed. Nothing novel or particularly insightful. Some of the issues are dated but many are still true today. Not bad writing and pleasant enough but I can't recommend it.The author's central theme is that the knowledge and experience of the old people in this country is wasted and that retirement is over-rated and a waste of time so people should keep working and not retire. I think he is very naive in this regard, he appears to have been lucky enough to find a career that he enjoyed, was good at, and was reasonably lucrative. He seems to believe that people should only work at jobs that they enjoy. Unfortunately that doesn't take into account the situation that most people find themselves in, working at a job only because it puts food on the table or for the benefits that it provides.He also doesn't seem aware of the normal disabilities that come with old age, loss of memory, coordination, strength, etc, which also limit one's ability to keep working.

I read "His Life and Crimes" when it first came out and liked it a lot. As a trial lawyer of both Civil and Criminal trials, I thought it was clever and an accurate representation of the absurdity of the criminal justice system. After reading the "Tutt" series I decided to re-aquaint myself with Wilkes. Frankly, I was disappointed in "Wilkes on Trial'. Rather than individual short stories, as "His Life and Crimes" it is several case interwoven but that is not the problem. Wilkes is not very clever and the plots are resolved by outside turns in the evidence. Cutely written but not very cleverly constructed. I'm much more impressed with the Tutt series and am looking for other authors capable of that level of writing.

Said Walter Cronkite in one of the book's blurbs, and I found it to be true. Riveting. My only complaint is that I would have liked to have read more detail about the daily life of these people. What did they do, day-to-day, besides fight the dirt, if the crops had died? How did they spend their time?A true ecological disaster, the first public consciousness of the concept of ecology, and an implicit condemnation of the "free market".

This is a 44 page booklet with photos written by a Navy Commander who served as Flag Lieutenant to Admiral Nimitz for four and one half years. It contains some mildly interesting anecdotes but no real insight into the Admiral. Disappointing, considering how long and in what such close contact the author was with the Admiral. Worth a read by an avid WW2 amateur historian but not worth purchasing. This is a pamphlet published and made available by the Admiral Nimitz Foundation in Fredericksburg, Texas.

I practiced law for 32 years and disliked it greatly much of the time. I would estimate that 90% of the lawyers that I know dislike the practice of law. I hated law school and only finished it because everyone told me that I didn't have to be a lawyer, that a law degree was very helpful in getting other jobs. The subtitle of this book would lead one to believe that the book will provide information about those jobs. In that sense the book is misleading.There really aren't many jobs where a law degree, as such, is helpful. The author mostly lists every job that lawyers have ever taken outside of the law and obvious jobs in law related fields.However, this book is a must read for anyone considering law school or who is greatly dissatisfied with the practice of the law. It has excellent assessment tools and practical advice as to what to look for to find greater satisfaction in one's career, whatever it might be. Many lawyers, myself included, went to law school because we didn't know what else to do and thought a law degree would be useful. With Law School costs being what they are that is NOT a good enough reason. The book explains the almost universal concerns that lawyers have with the practice of law, and also emphasizes that for the average practitioner the practice of law does NOT make them wealthy. So, if making money is one's sole motivation, other fields provide greater opportunities to do so.

Gore Vidal loved the book and so do almost all the other reviewers here. What a bore (hmm, the towns all have female names, significant?). I also just read "If On A Winter's Night A Traveler..." More engaging but.... A clever but, for me, an insubstantial author. I hesitate to read his "The Baron In The Trees".You lovers of his work: Can you actually recall more than three descriptions of the cities? And are the descriptions anything like what you'd apply to cities you've known? (Yes I know its fantasy but they have no ring of truth to them.)

I bought several ear buds for my wife's iPod because she was uncomfortable wearing the stock earbuds. Sennheiser always has had a good reputation and these got good reviews. She didn't like any of the options and prefers lightweight over the ear headphones so we put them away. I then bought an iPod and tried the different options that I bought for her. These produce a very muddy sound. By far the best are the Creative EP-630s. I now use those and store them in the Sennheiser case which is a great design and prevents cord tangle.If the carrying case comes with these ear buds (and some reviews say that it didn't), I'd buy them because the case is worth $10.00.

These are NOT Sopranos' recipes. For true Sopranos fans the book is just a marketing ploy. The recipes sound very good but the only connection with the Sopranos is that they are for Italian food, (and there are some cutesy pie "quotes" from Sopranos characters). Carm's famous Lasagna recipe, "with fresh basil leaves under the cheese" as Uncle Junior tells Bobby when he tells her about the lasagna that Janice "made" but was really passing off as her own, isn't even included or attributed to her. How hard would that have been? Buy it for the recipes, if they look good to you, not for the Sopranos connection.

When Unions changed our country for the better (Do you like your 8 hour day and 40 hour week?).Good stuff but I wish there was a broader base of performers.If you like this you should love "Talking Union" by the Almanac Singers. Also, read Pete Seeger's biography for a sense of the '30s & '40s from a performer's perspective. "Big Trouble" is a fantastic read for a view of Unions around the turn of the last Century.

I have a long-standing interest in history with a particular interest in american military history and FDR. I've read extensively and was interested in a biography of Churchill to dove-tail with my prior reading. As an american reader I find that at least a quarter of the book could have been deleted as it contains asides wherein Jenkins discusses other British historical figures and makes comparisons of Churchill's political positions with prior British parlimentary figures. Some of that is somewhat interesting as it points out how interrelated the members of the British ruling class were up until WWII but the information is not particularly relevant to understanding Churchill. I have no quarrel with Jenkin's comments and insights into Churchill, the author's political background I think is helpful and important in his analysis of Churchill. For a British reading public the British minutia may be interesting, for me it made reading the book more of a chore than it needed to be. Fortunately most of the trivia is in the chapters about Chrchill's earlier life. I'll have to read Manchester.

I'm using these on a 2005 MINI. I was looking for inexpensive covers and they fit the bill. However, if you have side bolsters on your seats the covers do not fit the seats snugly. Also,the covers will cover any pockets you have on the back of your seats and any back rake adjustment levers and quick release levers that slide the seat forward.The covers have a thin foam lining so I doubt that they will stand up to a washing once they have gotten dirty.One more thing, the illustration makes the covers look like they are a solid grey, they are not. The panels on the sides of the front of the seat are solid grey, the center panel is a multi-hued grey lozenge pattern. (The back and sides are a grey stretch material.)

Arthur Train was a lawyer who wrote short stories about his lawyer character, Mr. Tutt, for the "Saturday Evening Post", 20th century America's most popular magazine. The stories were written from 1919 until 1946. Mr. Tutt is a champion of the underdog and oppressed (widows, orphans, poor farmers, etc.) and uses his legal accumen to rescue his clients from unfair encounters with the law. Each story revolves around a point of law, usually obscure, which Tott either applies or finds an ingenious way around.Train's portraits of the legal system are as accurate today as they were 90 years ago.This book is a "Best of" collection. However, in this edition, the author has annotated each case with a legal footnote worthy of a law review article. In it he gives an explanation of the law and cites all the relevant cases pertaining to the law.For lawyers, Tutt is the type of lawyer many of us aspired to become. For non-lawyers he is the type of lawyer they would want to retain.

The three year old Bosch wiper was squeaking because it'd turned stiff and wouldn't flip over on the opposite stroke. I replaced it with Rain-X. The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer. I'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well. WRONG! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous. Luckily I didn't have far to go before I could change it. I've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand. Maybe I got a bad one but I've never had this happen with other brands. I won't chance buying these again.

Read about the plot of "Love and Death" in other reviews.I love the early Woody Allen Comedies and this is my favorite. HOWEVER, I have concerns about the "original release" wide screen format, it doesn't seem to me to be full letter box size, as I recall from seeing the movie in the the theater. If cropped, it affects the cinematography as well as some of the comedic background lines. 3 stars for the cropped version, 5 for the original letterbox.Definitely view it in the "original, wide-screen format" and not in the modified VHS cropped version if your DVD player allows.

I've been a Civil War Buff for over forty years and first read about the battle in a Random House Landmark book, as a kid. This book is one of the best I've read on the subject and one of the best Civil War books, I've read. (I'll have to check others in the same series.) The text is superb, very detailed, and the collection of period photographs, illustrations and maps is terrific and bring the event and participants to life. Despite the fact that both sides realized the importance of ironclads and built many of them (more by the industrial north, of course) this was the only battle of the Civil War in which ironclads opposed each other. It's also interesting to note that the C.S.S Virginia (known to the north as the Merrimack, the Union frigate whose hull was used by the Confederates) caused the biggest defeat and loss of life to the U.S Navy until Pearl Harbor. My only complaint is that the book does not credit the primary sources from which the information was obtained.

De Tocqueville is every bit as brilliant and insightful as he has been said to be. The book is as relevant now as when written and is a must read for every american who is serious about understanding his country. What one realizes in reading the book is how novel and radical was the american experiment in creating a state that was both a republic and a democracy. De Toqueville's research was amazing, as well, he read the laws and constitutions of the various states, he didn't just observe the manifestation of american government and society. His assessments of the plusses and minuses of our government forms was incredibly astute and it is interesting to reflect on the changes that took place in the government after his time and how accurately he foresaw the advantages and disadvantages of those changes, as well. Given the short period of time that he spent in this country and the distances that he travelled one stands in awe of his work. His writing style is, of course, dated but one gets accustomed to it and learns to follow the rhythm.

Of the four prequel pre-Peninsula campaign Sharpe's books this is the second worst. Cornwall seems to have written these more for the money than anything else. Tiger and Trafalgar I'd rate a four, Triumph a two. Hakeswill is in all three land based novels and a female relationship in three out of four. Cornwall seems to be writing by the numbers. Hakeswill escapes all the deaths that Sharpe arranges for him, as we know he will, but nothing is done to him, officially, even though higher up officers learn of Hakesill's nefarious deeds. Sloppy loose ends on Cornwall's part. As always, an interesting way to learn about British military history.

I grew up reading "The New Yorker" and have always loved this style of writing the most famous of which, contemporaneously, is done by John McPhee. This is good stuff, "Mr 880", about the smallest of small-time counterfeiters,was made into a movie. I loved the article when I first read it and it was a treat to read again.Readers should be aware that seven of the twelve articles contained in this book are also found in the author's "Reporting at Wit's End" which has 18 articles.

I haven't read all there is to read about El Alamein but I have read some accounts, including Montgomery's own and that found in the "Monty" biography by Hamilton. I found this book to be of great value in its analysis of the strengths, and many weaknesses, of the Eighth Army and the lessons learned. His detailed explanation of the individual units maneuvers also brought the battle down to earth and illustrated what Montgomery's contributions really were to the campaign. He gives Monty his due but knocks him down to size, which is very refreshing. I also appreciated the specifics of his conclusion that many of the lessons learned by the Eighth Army in the Desert Campign were inapplicable to its future campaigns and his explanation of the lessons that were transferable. Very well written with much detail but not so as to be unapproachable or "technical" in the bad sense.

Read the other reviews as to what this book is about. Let me just say that I've lent this book to at least twenty people, car lovers and non-car lovers. They have all loved the book. Unfortunately, the book wasn't returned and I bought two more copies, one to keep and one to lend out. For sportscar lovers this is a MUST read.All the books in the series are good, but this is the best. The others are enjoyable, particularly for sports car lovers, but this one is great because it's appeal is almost universal.

I was an American History major in college and have been a WWII buff since the '50s first reading "Life's Picture History of WWII" at age 7 when it was published in 1950. I have read constantly and voraciously about the war since then. I've read biographies of FDR, Churchill, Marshall, Brooke, MacArthur, Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Stillwell and King, among others. Most of my reading has been by American authors and most have denigrated Montgomery. I have not read this condensed version of Montgomery's life but have read the first two volumes of the set by the author. It has been an eye-opening experience for me. I find the author to be extremely fair, so far (I have the last volume on order and am eager to read the author's take on th '44 to the end of the war given my knowledge of Arnhem, and the Antwerp estuaries which have always been Montgomery's two biggest blunders in my eyes.)Having read other accounts of the Normandy invasion I found it eye-opening that the invasion was truly Montgomery's brainchild. He stepped in after the allies piddled around with an inadequate and unrealistic plan and applied his considerable knowledge and experience as the only truly successful allied general.The author is not at all hesitant to point out Montgomery's failings, which, as a person were considerable . However, Montgomery as a tactician, strategist and commander of the allied forces up to and through the Normandy landings was brilliant. American authors and Generals have criticized him and tried to puff up the American players but the Americans were inexperienced amateurs with truly inflated senses of their own competence. This is especially true given their lack or minimal amount of combat experience. The great Marshall felt that America should have immediately invaded Europe and felt hood-winked by the British who kept putting it off. However, had the Americans not gotten experience, the hard way, through their blundering in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, an early invasion would have been a catastrophe. Eisenhower, in particular, lacked combat experience and had an exaggerated sense of his own battle abilities. Witness the fiasco of planning for the invasions of Sicily and Italy. The Ardennes, Huertgen Forest and Patton's set battles, such as Metz, are further examples of American military leadership's overconfidence and arrogance.Montgomery put his experience as the only successful allied commander into use by revamping and organizing the floundering Normandy invasion preparation. His strategic vision was perfect and his dedication to that vision against the vacillation of Eisenhower, Churchill and others and the plotting of rivals was exemplary and the reason for the success of the invasion. As Americans, our propaganda machinery has downplayed the Commonwealth effort, has glorified the American effort and it's leaders, and has made the invasion out to be solely the result of American planning and execution, with the Commonwealth armies present only as on-lookers. This book is a good dose of reality. As I said, I've read biographies and autobiographies of the other major players as well as other books on the war in the West and it is clear that this biography fills in the gaps, omissions, oversights and falsifications of the shared events recalled by these others.It is a must read for anyone with a serious interest in WWII.

I purchased two of these because they had the most features of all the Motorola models. Having NOW read the reviews of some of the competitors I am certain that I would have been just as happy with cheaper models. These are the "cutest" and smallest, but the feature of different sounds to identify different callers is a disappointment. The SENDING radio makes five different noises to identify five different senders, but the noise is made out loud on the sender's radio and the noise is transmitted the same as one's voice would be. I find it annoying and not worth any extra cost over the model 250. The only advantage that I can see of the Motorola 250 and 280 over the competition is the number of channels and sub-channels they make available. This would be a useful feature when there are lots of other radios being used in the area, such as at a crowded theme park but, in the circumstances that I find myself, there are never other radios around and I am not certain that we will be able to communicate with radios with less channels.My wife and I use the radios when we are caravaning on drives with our car club and they have been very useful. One member missed a turnoff when he didn't see us turn and we were able to re-direct him, otherwise we probably would not have seen him until the end of the day.Another consideration in making a purchase of a two-way radio is the number and type of accessories, we wound up spending as much on accessories as we did on the radios: arm holsters, earphone/ microphone combination for easier hands free operation when driving a car and rechargeable batteries and chargers.

I have a L5-S1 herniated disc. This is the program recommended to me by my orthopedist. It's worked for me. Since using I've only had minor flare ups every 3-4 years. Check with your doctor before using.However, after using for twenty four years I have developed a numbness in one leg which was diagnosed as an L4-L5 impingement. Physical therapy did not help but I discovered that if I discontinued daily use of these exercises the numbness went away. Unfortunately my lower back pain returns. So I now do the exercises about once every three days.

I've been a civil war buff since 1959 and was really looking forward to this book. Save yourself the money and follow the following instructions.Fill in the blanks:"On____(date) at_____(civil war engagement), ____(rank) of the _____(unit) gave _____(name of opponent)_____(rank)____(unit): Check one: water, blanket, coat, bread, tobacco or: moved, built shelter, covered up, built a barricade to shield from bullets, took to field hospital."There. That's 95% of the incidents described. Very few have more detail or are more involved then that. Admittedly, the remaining 5% are worth reading about but not worth wading through the book or paying its price. A five page article would suffice.

I installed this on a 1999 Chevy 454 which powers my 21' Motorhome. K&N; states that it should increase horsepower by 24 hp. I have always used K&N.; They have an excellent reputation in performance car circles. I have no reason to doubt their claim but I don't feel the extra HP. Nor did I notice any MPG improvement. I do hear the intake noise at high revs and it is very annoying. I would not do this mod if I had it to do over again.I have since removed it as the noise on long journeys was tiresome. Again, I can't tell if there was a power loss upon removal and I can't tell if there was any mileage gain when installed and consequent loss when removed. I've kept mileage records but there have been too many variables to know cause and effect.

Jiggering it around and drilling through the cabinet frame, the unit still protrudes from under the cabinet and I still had to get a right angle converter AND loosen all the mounting screws and gouge the drywall to get it to fit. That's ridiculous.

The author learned of the research of Ian Stevenson, M.D. and decided to accompany him to evaluate the subjects first hand. The book spends more time describing the details of the trips and the surroundings the author found himself in than on describing the subjects themselves. In support of the evidence of reincarnation the author concludes that the subjects are truthful and the evidence cannot be explained by any other explanation than reincarnation, but it is much more interesting to read the evidence in the several books that Ian Stevenson has written about his case studies.

Carping over Hoyt's historical analysis of Japan leading up to the 19th century aside, Hoyt presents Japan's attempt at imperialism based upon his access to Japan's Official sources. He shows the rise of militarism, especially by the Army and its control of the Japanese Government and the mindset that led to Japan's invasion of Manchuria, China and all that followed. Of most interest to me was how factionalized the military was, how apparently unorganized was its planning and what lack of control the higher ups had over their inferiors, both in the Army and, to a much lesser degree, the Navy.I had been aware of the Japanese atrocities in Nanking and the Bataan Death March but Hoyt made me aware of the similar atrocities in Hong Kong and Singapore as well as other incidents. I never felt that Hoyt tried to excuse the Japanese behavior but he did show that often it was the result of the actions of local commanders who frequently disregarded the orders of their superiors. In other instances, notably in the Phillipines, Hoyt shows how more compassionate commanders were replaced by more barbaric commanders when Tokyo felt the officers weren't successful enough.I feel that the book is impressively researched and well written. I am particulary impressed with the description of the changing attitude of the military once it realized that the war was lost and its suicidal phiosophy for itself and the people, starting with the adoption of Kamikaze attacks, first on ships and then against the B-29s. Finally with training for the entire population.A great book to read together with Toland's book for an understanding of the Japanese mentality that lead them into WWII.

The author searches to understand what his father's participation in the photograph of the Marines raising the flag on Mt. Surubachi meant. His research is tenacious but the weakest part of the book is his attempt to flesh out the other participants in the flag raising. The author stretches to make them individuals. This isn't his fault, it's been a long time and the memories of friends and relatives have faded. More importantly, to me at least, is the fact that they were all ordinary Americans. They all felt their obligation to fight for their country and went through Hell. It is the detailed description of that Hell, that was Iwo Jima, that makes the book terrific and the experience more understandable than "Life" photos, Mailer, Jones or other WWII novelists have been able to do.

What a complete letdown. Various individuals, either connected with the making of cartoons or historians/students of the form talk about the cartoon industry's enlistment in the war effort of WWII. Rather than letting the viewer see them for him or herself, we get about three minutes of uninteresting babbling and 30 seconds of film clip. The unanswered question is: &quot;Where can we see the actual cartoons?&quot; I feel that my money was wasted, I'd certainly never watch this &quot;collection&quot; more than once.

While this is labeled as being Goose Repellant, I spoke with the manufacturer and learned that it is the same formula as Rejex-it Migrate that is sold to keep birds from eating fruits and berries. I tried it on my Peach and Nextarine trees which were so ravaged by birds last year that I got only two or three pieces of edible fruit from each tree. This year winds and late snows meant that I only had six to eight fruits on each tree. I sprayed them with this formula and it did keep the birds from eating the fruit. I was told that it is a grape based formula that is in some sort of gelatin solution. The birds do not like the taste and move on, however, they may try other pieces of fruit on the tree before deciding to leave the tree alone. The gelatin solution is supposed to dissolve when washed in water but I did find a residual taste. I'm going to try to find a better method of washing the fruit.The product is used commercially by fruit growers and I did read the results of a test conducted by an Ag College that showed that it is effective (I can't recall the College but I found it by doing a web search). This is the only product that I have found that keeps birds from eating the fruit on my trees.I'll re-rate it to five stars if I can find a way to wash off all the residue.

This book details all the battles that the allies (French included, surprise, surprise) fought from D-Day to the German surrender. It's the best book with an overall perspective that I've read. The author, I feel, from all my reading, mostly biographies, is scrupulously fair in his assessments of the personalities involved. He gives credit where due and criticizes that which is justified.I won't give a more in depth description because it's been done so well by other reviewers. I echo the cricism of the poor maps, a defect felt most strongly because of the detail the author provides about the strategy, battles and tactics. Also, given all the personalities identified and described, photos of them would be appreciated. The soft cover edition has a row of 14 photos on the cover but no identification is provided.

I was disappointed with this product. I mostly used the Beginner Tests but several of the Advanced Tests that I used were the same as the Beginner. The color tests are very subjective. The contrast and brightness tests are useful but did not change the settings that I'd arrived at on my own. The aspect ratio set up was the only thing that I found helpful and it quickly resolved aspect issues that I'd had. Once I had my settings I still needed to tweek them further after viewing the picture for a while.

The subject is fascinating: China and its commercial fleet and their voyages of exploration, and even more: China's high level of civization that the West took centuries to equal. The author, however, has to puff himself up and repeat how he discovered the information to support his view. The fact that he was a naval Captain and had visited the areas traveled by the Chinese and had technical knowledge about sea travel that other historians didn't, allowed him to put together facts thought to be unrelated. But we GET it. He did a great job, but better writing and editing would reduce the book and make it a more readable, and enjoyable experience.

Don't read this book if all you want to know about is the murder trial of Bill Haywood, defended by Clarence Darrow, and others- that is only the thread upon which the book hangs. The diversions are what make the book unique and which provide the varied dimensions that make one sense,and feel, in three dimensions, life at the turn of the last century. It is a stereopticon view. It is hard to conceive of any facet of turn-of-the-century American life which isn't explored, and described, in depth. If you don't like detail then avoid this book. I was constantly overwhelmed by the research that went into it, the amazing time and effort. The style is not dry but riveting and alive. It is a book that I wish I could say I produced, how anyone can give it less than five stars is beyond me. That the author committed suicide because he felt he failed is, truly, a tragedy, but it is impossible to see how he could have matched this effort in the rest of his lifetime. I read "Common Ground" when it first came out, the author's first book, it was good but this is great. I know of no other historical work that so totally conveys the sense of time and place as does this book.

I bought this product based upon all the glowing reviews. I'd hoped that it would help with my GERD condition which, after many years, barely responds to prescription medication (I've tried them all). After a month's use the condition is unchanged, the Jarrow has had no affect on my lower GI, as my bowel movements are the same, and I certainly do not feel any more energy. I will continue to finish off the box and, if my conditions change, I will revise my rating.I do not doubt the favorable reviews but, based upon my experience, this product is not a cure-all(or a cure-everyone).

This book does what it says. It lists low or no cost campgrounds, they may not be where you want to go or fit your mega motorhome, that's what commercial parks are for. I don't know if it is all-inclusive but it certainly has most of the campgrounds that I know of in areas in which I am familiar.

These socks are supposed to be sized to fit shoe sizes 6-12&1/2. I wear a size 11 and, if I pull them snug to the toe, the sock's heel slips around my heel and rides up the back of my foot. I washed them in hot and dried them on high and got them to shrink some but they are still a little too long. I got these to use for long walks on a forthcoming vacation and I'm concerned as to how well they will work. Aside from the excess length, I can feel the ribbing under the sole of my foot and I'm concerned that they will be uncomfortable for that pupose.

This door is plastic which isn't a problem EXCEPT: the metal screws that hold the two sides together, sandwiching the dog door to your door, screw into plastic holes. If you overtighten them you will strip the holes making the door useless without major modifications. Otherwise it is well designed and constructed.This item is cheaper at PetEdge.

I'm not a techno-geek so can't delve into the specifics of this T.V. As a consumer I find the Picture excellent and the options overly complicated, but what electronic equipment isn't these days.Update: 2/5/11: Have had no problems with the TV but am upgrading to a larger size. As Sony does not make a 36" I'm buying a Panasonic.

Love the "Wishbone" series. However, I like them for the acts that Wishbone, the Jack Russells perform, not for the moralistic stories about the kids. Wishbone does little in this other than run about in a costume. The version of Don Quixote is mediocre, too.

The Author recommended several areas of investment and I tracked most of the recommendations from February 27, 2006, approximately when the book was printed, until February 28th, 2011.He first recommended Gold stocks. Newmont tripled, Barrick doubled.His second recommendation was for oil stocks. BP decreased 33%, Chevron almost doubled, ExxonMobile increased 33% and Devon Energy increased by 50%. In oil service company stocks, Schlumberger increased over 50%, Noble rose about 10%, Nabors decresed about 15% and transocean decreased about 20%.He also recommended Real Estate and the trust that he recommended, Regency Centers, declined about 33%.His Chindia recommendations also did not fare so well, overall. 3M declined 33%, Coca-Cola increased 50%, Intel increased 5%, Proctor & Gamble stayed about the same and Texas Instruments increased 20%.I could not find info on most of his alternative energy recommendations but GE declined more than 33%.Next he recommended Liquid Natural Gas related companies. Chicago Bridge & Iron increased about 50% and Air Products and Chemicals increased almost 50%.He made a strong recommendation for Toyota which fared poorly and for Matsushita Electric which became Panasonic and, as far as I can tell, also did poorly.So, if you'd followed his advice with Energy and Gold stocks you would have done very well. If you'd followed all of his advice you would have done pretty well, comparatively, depending, of course, on how you had weighted his recommendations.

This is the album of his that I've wanted to hear. Jake playing solo, not with a group. It really showcases his virtuosity. There are a couple of bonus tracks playing with back up and even they are good, with the exception of one with a female vocal.It is disapointing that Amazon doesn't allow one to hear the tracks. Go to Barnes and Nobles' site for that. The CD is cheaper though them, as well.This is the best of his CDs. I give it four stars only because some of his phrasing is pretty corny. But his playing is brilliant.

I bought this for driving in a convertible, top down, because I liked the light weight, rigid brim with rocker shielding front and back. Moving in an open car it's fine. Otherwise one sweats like a pig. Tilley refused to take it back saying I should take it to the shop where I'd purchased it but the shop had gone out of business. I put in extra grommets but to no avail. It's no wonder that Tilley now makes many different mesh versions. There are many better hats available from other manufacturers w/o the added cost for the "hype".

After getting this I realized a serious lack in Dymo labelers: limited color selection. I'm much less interested in black on red, blue, yellow, green, etc. I need to label black surfaces and want white on clear or on black which Dymo does not make. Brother and Casio do, although both in limited tape sizes. The only other drawback with this labeler is limited type sizes.

Lehrer was the sophisticate's song writer when I was growing up in the '50s and '60s, I was suprised at how many of the lyrics I recalled. Few of the songs are really worth listening to now, other than for nostalgia sake. "Be Prepared", however is a classic.

This came to me highly recommended and I've used it on many cars over the years. I wish someone had done a comparison with other similar products, a la "Guru Reports". I can't tell if this lasts longer or protects better than others.I can tell you that it STINKS! It smells like an old man's body odor. Obviously not a problem for exterior use but, oh boy!, be prepared to keep your windows down for a while if used for interiors.It also seem pricey, o.k. if its superior to its competitors, not o.k, if its not.

If you're interested in New Age philosophy as it pertains to dogs, this is your cup of Chamomille tea. If you're interested in practical solutions to dog behavioral problems look elsewhere. I'd stongly advise you to take the book out of the library and read it before you buy it.I found it useless in addressing my/my dog's "issues".And, hey, I've meditated for years.

Like other readers I had seen the movie "Defiance" and wanted to learn more about the Bielskis and how they were able to succeed in maintaining a large group of Jews in the forests of Belarus during World War Two. I was very disappointed in this book, despite all the research that the author did in preparation for its writing. The language used is very stilted. The camp had communal kitchens with "a profusion of metal pots", one of the brothers "was wrested from his slumber", the partisans don't wait, they "bide their time", the brothers' band don't merely shoot, they "discharge their weapons" and "strafe" the enemy (they are on foot, not in airplanes). People are "filled with bullets". A German airplane lets loose a "torrent" of bullets, etc. Hitler, in invading Russia, intends "to drink tea" in Moscow. These are just a few examples of the author's use of trite phrases or excessive language. He must have sat with Roget's Thesaurus next to him in order to pad the language and lengthen the book. Similarly, the inclusion of the progress of World War Two around the globe has no relevence to what the Bielski's are encountering and seems to be used to pad the text.The author does provide some details that flesh out how the Bielski group was able to survive yet critical questions are not answered. The author describes how a party of the group sent out to obtain provisions led the Germans to their hideout in the forest because they were carrying a freshly killed cow in their horse drawn sleigh and the enemy was able to follow the trail of fresh blood in the snow. The enemy was unable to follow the sleigh and horse tracks in the snow? How had the Bielskis been able to cover their tracks in the snow covered country? Apparently this question never occurred to the author.I found the material interesting but the writing painful.

The first three chapters are Miniature Schnauzer specific and have decent info. The rest is generic to any breed with pictures of Miniature Schnauzers. An O.K. book for basic Miniature Schnauzer info but it's gotten some things wrong. Miniature Schnauzers are really NOT terrier related, although they are shown in the U.S. in the terrier group, That wasn't always so and isn't so in other countries. They were originally shown in the Working Dog group. They do not have a typical terrier personality, which, for most people is a good thing. (I'm a terrier lover so I'm not putting Terriers down.)

A must read for owners of Irish Terriers. From the forward it's clear that the Londons owned one similar to Jerry.For lovers of South Seas stories this is right up there with stories by Conrad and Stevenson as far as descriptions of the millieu. (The plot is more simplistic, but it is written from a dog's point of view.)

While the author's test may not be 100% accurate, her premise is that one should be VERY careful in adopting dogs in order not to get an aggressive dog. This is something that most other adoption books gloss over. The author is concerned that many agencies seeking to have dogs adopted are more concerned with getting the dog a home than in protecting the adopting owner. Why adopt trouble?I've had 12 dogs in my life and am thinking of adopting when my 12 year old dog dies. I've been reading as many books as I can about adopting dogs and adult dog behavior and this is one of the best that I've found.

I heard a brief review of this book on public radio and, being at my public library, checked it out. I haven't laughed so hard in years and was in tears at the end. I can't say that this is a "great" book as in: "will be a classic" but it is wonderful, terrific and a "must" read. I am buying three copies, one to send to a favorite aunt, one to loan to all my friends and one to send to my kids in another state. I haven't done anything like this with a book since "Last Open Road". This book deserves to be more widely read. I'm certainly going to look at the author's other books. Don't miss it.It's 2011 and my wife and I stumbled upon the book again and re-read it. We couldn't stop laughing. I bought more copies for friends.

I want a slow cooker cook book for main course recipes, this book emphasizes side dishes, desserts, etc. and has few main course recipes that interest me. Some of the ones I looked at said to cook 9 hours on high which doesn't make sense, based on my experience with crock pots, but I did not try them so can't say if the advice is wrong. I purchased used, cheaply, but would NOT pay full price for it.

Saw the British series first. This is a pale approximation despite following the British plots and even the dialogue with only revisions for American instead of British slang. Later shows go off on their own, developing their own style.None of the characters are developed to the degree that they were in the British series which may be as a result of American TV having more commercials and less running time for the actual show. Hence the different dynamics between the different characters is missing which gave the British series much more depth.Not bad, and better than much American TV, but it loses too much from the British version. Watch the British version, it has its flaws but is superior to this.The Second disc improves, greatly. One reason is that it strikes out on its own as far as plots are concerned. The American show is much more plot driven than the British version which is more character driven. The two shows wind up being two different cups of tea (or coffee).If one hasn't seen either of the shows, I'd recommend that the American series be watched first and the British series second.

A conservative's revisionist history of FDR. It is always good to revisit popular assumptions to determine their validity but I'd be more impressed by this book if I'd been able to read peer reviews, which I have not been able to find, that substantiate his research and conclusions. 20-20 hindsight is always easy, and I have no doubt that many of the author's claims are valid as to how the New Deal policies prolonged the Depression, and how the New Deal spent money in places that would help it politically rather than in the places that needed it most, but his free market bias is so evident: everything would have been better if the free market had been left alone to run its course. Sure, except for the workingman who was slaving for starvation wages, if he could find work. Child labor, unsafe working conditions, such as the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which the author refers to as "tragic", none of these things are the result of the free market in his view. As long as there are more workers than jobs the free market will never protect worker's rights. He seems to believe that the Union movement was only about obtaining power for power's sake and not about protecting the worker. He accuses the New Deal of using examples of Business abuses that were atypical in order to pass anti-business legislation but is guilty of the same thing in his anti-union bias.Perhaps this book will bring about a re-examination of the New Deal, and FDR, by an impartial, unbiased academic. Let's hope so.

I was fortunate to have seen Rev. Davis perform in N.Y.C. around 1960. I believe that I saw him at the Riverside Church on the same bill as a newcomer, Bob Dylan. He was a blind street singer who lived in the South and in New York City. His songs run from blues to religious, his guitar playing is brilliant and unique and his voice, wonderful. After hearing him play I bought all of his albums that were then available. This is an album of religious songs most of which I hadn't heard before or since. It's also one of my favorites of his. I have the 33 LP album and have just been recording the songs to cassette so I can't comment on the CD quality. I'm loving the songs as much, now, as in 1960. I'm thrilled to see that there are CDs that weren't available as LPs and will be completing my collection with those.

This product routed me from Reno to Santa Cruz appropriately (by a route that I would have plotted on a map and which Google, Yahoo and AAA plot.) For the return trip it sent me off the freeways, down a two lane country road, through the suburbs and then the heart of downtown Livermore with the attendent slower speed limits, stop signs and stop lights. It added at least 45 minutes to my trip. This was after I upgraded to unlimited map upgrading.Garmin support gave no explanation of how this happened but only suggested a complicated process of, essentially, re-booting my unit. I asked to have my money refunded for the upgrade and even told them that I'd first send them the unit since the upgrade was only for the unit. They refused.I was traveling an area with which I had some familiarity so realized the routing error (but not in time to back track). With no way of knowing if the recommendations by Garmin would correct the error, without re-driving the route, I have no confidence in Garmin's reliability and will buy a competitor's product. I wish that I had done so before wasting $90.00 on the upgrade.

This book, as others in the series, is a compilation of short stories which were originally printed in "The Saturday Evening Post", the most popular american magazine in the 20th Century. The author, a New York City lawyer, wrote the pieces between 1919 and 1947, when he died. The hero is a lawyer who tries to prevent misjustice being done by the legal system as manipulated by wrong doers. He is a knight in shining armor who protects the innocent and powerless and he does it by an in-depth knowledge of the law. The writing is based upon a simple but fascinating formula. The author takes an arcane principal of law. It is either used by the heavies, and the hero has to find a way around it, or Mr. Tutt uses it to get around the unprincipled and unjust use of the law by the heavies. Lawyers will appreciate how accurately he presents the laws involved. In fact, one of the compilations of the series, "Mr. Tutt's Casebook", after each story, has a detailed analysis of the law involved, it's history and contrary decisions, that is of Law Review caliber.As a recently retired practitioner I am amazed at how little the law and the practice of law has changed in almost 100 years.As a caution I must say that I have loaned these books to several of my lawyer friends and they have not been as charmed with them as I have.

The sequel to &quot;The Last Open Road&quot; it is a must read for readers who loved it. As a stand alone book it isn't quite as good and might not be appreciated as much if read by itself. &quot;The Last Open Road&quot; is multi-dimensional, it is a great car tale and also a coming of age story of a young man who wants to be a sportscar mechanic and is pursuing a girlfriend at the same time. All three threads are intertwined. The book is wonderfully evocative of time and place, you can smell and feel the summer nights which he describes. In &quot;Montezuma's Ferrari&quot; the protagonist is a successful mechanic and married so the focus is mostly on the car tales and the descriptions are not as engrossing but the book is still wonderful.

These are articles from various car mags. The articles are interesting in themselves, Burt is a good writer, but particularly interesting for fans of his &quot;Last Open Road&quot;, &quot;Montezuma's Ferrari&quot; and &quot;Fabulous Trashwagon&quot; trilogy. The book is an autobiography of Burt's interests in cars and we see that many of the incidents in his trilogy were taken from his real life experiences. Car lovers will enjoy the book, I haven't tested this out on non-car lovers.

"The Last Open Road" was great, I loaned it to more than twenty friends, car nuts and non-carnuts, and gave copies as gifts. Everyone loved it. This is the second sequel (and probably the last from the way the plot develops). If you enjoyed the first two you'll enjoy this as well but, standing alone, it's not as good as the second ("Montezuma's Ferrari") which wasn't as good as the first.

Not really. Anyone with five days experience with difficulty swallowing could cull through normal cookbooks and come up with the recipes offered here. 60 vegetable dishes, including: Orzo, Glazed carrots, spinach lasagna, Sauerkraut and Apples, Braised Red Cabbage, Sauteed Spinach, Polenta with Cheese, Candied Yams, Pesto Mashed Potatoes, two recipes for scalloped potatoes, latkes (potato pancakes) and a few more which are slightly more imaginative. 52 soup recipes. Really? I couldn't figure out for myself that soup is easy to swallow and find my own recipes?In a similar vein, Breakfast Dishes: Cream of Wheat, Biscuits and Gravy. Poached Eggs Hollandaise with Grits, Cheese souffle, Potato frittata, French Toast, Pancakes, etc.How about main courses? It's broken down into fish and meats, 6 fish recipes and 13 meat recipes. Fish: Salmon Loaf, Salmon Pate, Baked fish with white wine sauce, Steamed Mussels (what, no clams?), Bay Scallops, and Crab Quiche. Moving on to Meats: Grilled Filet Mignon with Portobello mushrooms (wow. wouldn't have thought of that! Oh, I see, pulse meat in a food processor and then heap over mushrooms.), Machaca con Huevos (Shredded Beef with Eggs in a Tortilla), Little Ham Loaves, Pulled Pork BBQ, Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas, Chicken Tamale Pie, Chicken with Mole sauce, Kentucky style Stewed Chicken with Dumplings, Chicken a la King (over biscuits or potatoes, not toast), Chicken Liver Pate, Braised Lamb and Eggplant Provencale, Shepherd's pie and Moussaka. Desserts and Drinks are all, similarly, obvious.Certainly NOT worth $14.95. Buy used, if you must.

I grew up in the '50s and my Mother had several cookbooks but "Joy of Cooking" was the bible. All my childhood favorites come from the book and when I moved out on my own it was the basic cookbook on which I relied. I bought a more recent version about 15 to 20 years ago but it wasn't as good. This is NOT the version with which I grew up. It's recipes are few, very dated, and, mostly, uninteresting. If you like oysters there's several.An interesting read for it's historical and sociological value but not worth purchasing for the recipes themselves. Frankly, there are no recipes that I would try because either they are boring or they have been updated by more interesting versions.

I read a recommendation for this book by Wade Davis in "The Week" in his list of the best books about WWI. I'd read some of the books and had heard of the others, with the exception of "Three Day Road". I'd neither read nor heard of it. This book is great on so many levels. First it deals with aspects of the war that are unique, as far as I know: the Canadian Army in WWI, Canadian Indians serving in the Canadian Army, Canadian Indians life in the wilderness and on "reserves" at the time, the role of snipers in WWI, often mentioned in WWI books, but only casually, despite their significance (see: "All Quiet on the Western Front"). Second, it deals with the horrors of war and the psychological dilemma of killing or being subject to being killed. Third, the author's descriptions of places, the Canadian Wilderness, the French Countryside and the front lines are beautifully done and evocative of the settings.While this book is a novel and written by a contemporary author it is clear that he meticulously researched his subject matter.This book is a must read for anyone interested in war, WWI or good writing.

I was looking for another Native American flute artist after discovering R. Carlos Nakai, whom I really like. Based upon reviews by a self-professed flautist and appreciater of Native American flautists, despite not being able to learn anything about the music from listening to the 30 second sound bites, I purchased the album. Big disappointment. There is a fine line between subtle and boring. This music is so unvarying and monotonous that it far transgresses that line. It is expensive white noise. I can understand it being used for entirely unobtrusive background music at a spa but for anyone who wants to LISTEN to flute music it is a complete waste of time. Also, when I meditate I don't want any other noise than my breathing so it is of no use to me for that purpose.Your tastes may difer from mine but I strongly recommend that you listen to the entire album before purchasing it.

Some exotic ingredients: Bull penis for one, some questionable hygenic practices, can the Brits get away with them because their climate is cooler? and I've heard that the recipes don't always come out right because the Two Fat ladies didn't measure and the editor guesstimates, but don't know if that's true. I haven't tried any of the recipes and they are heavy on fish recipes but there are many that sound terrific and I'd like to try.

The plot is absolutely ridiculous and there are long stretches that move at a snails crawl. On the Plus side the film is beautifully shot and the location in Venice is a treat to watch.Is this supposed to be a Comedy? Not so, other reviewers compare it to Hitchcock flicks but, if so, this is a lame attempt at the genre.

I've had this for several years, bought it when it first came out. I like it very much, it took the place of 35mm film SLRs that I'd used for years.It is complicated to take maximum advantage of it's potential but it takes great pictures on the auto setting.I really like the electric contacts that determine if your hand is grasping the camera. If not it shuts off so battery isn't drained.Two features that make me reduce its rating. It is very difficult to tell depth of field if you are using it's manual aperture and the photos are vignetted if you use a filter and I like to keep a polarizing filter on all lenses that can be fitted.Decent size, not too big. But I do borrow my wife's pocket Canon for ease of use and portability

What can you say about a pan? I wanted a three inch deep pan because a recipe for cranberry upside-down cake spilled over a two inch pan. This one worked fine.

Much time is spent for a plot that covers a very small period of time in history. A lot of re-hashing prior plots and more emphasis than necessary on Flashy's trashy exploits.

This is the most concentrated and with the highest calories of all the supplements I have found. The downside is that it is very gluey, even thinned with frozen fruits and extra water in a smoothie. I cannot tolerate it. I find Ensure Plus easier to drink.

Judge Harold R. Medina, U.S Court of Appeals, put it best in his introduction to "Mr. Tutt at his Best": "Mr. Tutt stories...fascinated me, as they did thousands of other young lawyers eager to believe that justice was not always at the mercy of prosecutors who wanted convictions, sometimes from motives that were none too pure, or of the large number of unscrupulous persons in various categories connected or not conneceted with the law, who seemed so often in real life to prevail over the righteous and the just...Mr. Tutt was my hero."And is mine.The stories are brilliantly clever, the law, accurate, and little has changed in the practice of the law in almost 100 years (Train began writing about his character in 1919 and continued until 1947).Each story is centered on an arcane legal issue which Tutt either uses to his client's benefit or finds a way around in order to, usually, provide justice to those deserving of it.

I love mandolin, I love clarinet, and I love klezmir music. Most of the songs on this album, while beautifully played by great musicians are BORING. They sound like background music to dull scenes in "The Godfather". One Mandolin duet is brilliant and a couple of other cuts are very good but, my advice: listen to the entire CD before buying. Not just the snippets that Amazon allows you to hear. I did that and was still disapointed.

A real page turner, believe it or not. I couldn't put it down. Jam packed with information. If some of the facts are incorrect, and it didn't seem so to me who is wide read and has basic knowledge of most science, it is only to be expected. Who could possibly fact check a book with such encyclopedic scope.My wife is reading it now and is similarly intrigued.By the way, it's HISTORY, not a cook book. Don't read it if History bores you.

Maybe the accents aren't authentic but the actors are the most believable, Heston is terrific as Silver and I normally hate Heston's acting. I wish the uncut DVD was available. Locations, cinematography are fantastic.

I purchased "Throne of Blood" from one of the other listed sellers. It is clearly an asian version (though it plays on U.S. systems), it says "BoYing" on a corner, . The print quality is just O.K. but the sub-titles and other english translations are not the usual bad but are atrocious. I don't know if the Criterion Edition is better, perhaps someone who reads this review and has a Criterion Edition can comment. If it is better, spend the extra money and do not get the BoYing version. This is acceptable only if nothing better is available.

This is an out-of-print three volume set. It reads like a novel and the only reason I don't give it five stars is because it could use more photographs, maps and drawings than it has.

This book is nowhere near the complete guide, as it states. I assume from that that it would contain most, if not all, of the public campgrounds. It doesn't. It lists mostly prominent sites that could be referenced though other sources, including AAA.Looking at one of the areas with which I am familiar the location of several sites on the area map was WRONG. Reading the description of the campground will give you accurate directions but if you put your finger on the map and say "let's head for there to stop tonight", you'd be nowhere near the campground. I didn't check to see if the publisher had merely mis- numbered the locations on the map.The only advantage of this book is its scenic ranking, but I have not checked sites to see if I agree with his assessments.

Removing AAA batteries from the charger is a real pain. Also, you must be careful when inserting AAA batteries to be certain that they are pushed in all the way.

Born and raised in a Communist Family the author's life experiences teach him that the ideal of Communism is not what the Communist Party seeks. A fascinating account and extremely well written book.

This group ranks up with the best, more famous groups. I particularly like that on this CD that there are traditional a capella songs and songs backed by a New Orleans Jazz Band which blends well with the singers.

This book, together with a similar book, "Old Souls", purports to be about cases of reincarnation but is really about the author. The author is a "new age" rabbi (my description, not necessarily his). He reports that he has experienced astral projection and other extra-sensory perceptions. While he states that he has talked with hundreds of individuals who claim to be reincarnated after having died in the Holocaust, he only refers to the specifics of about twelve cases. The rest of his book is discourse on jewish philosophy and teachings, as they relate to reincarnation, and his personal interpretation of reincarnation as he perceives it fits into those teachings. If one is interested in "case studies" one is best served by reading Ian Stevenson, M.D. 's books. Interesting, though, the evidence from both authors shows that those individuals who believe themselves to be reincarnated, and I am convinced that they have been, are greatly affected by their past life recollections in some ways, i.e. they have phobias related to past life events, but the FACT of being reincarnated seems to have no affect on how they lead their current lives. Upon reflection, that makes sense, and so, my conclusion is: reincarnation does occur but: so what?

I love "The Motown Sound". "The Commitments" is one of my top ten movies of all time and I consider it be as close to perfect as a movie can be. I watch it at least once every six months. The two "Commitments" records are two of my favorites and I think that their covers are often better than the originals. Strong has a terrific voice, and did "The Commitments" when he was 16, I believe. But EVERYONE on "The Commitments" was great. This album has only ten cuts and two are of the same song, only one a longer version. I love EVERY ONE of "The Commitments" cuts and have downloaded them to my "Best Songs" collection. None of these makes the cut and only one is memorable. I would strongly advise listening to the CD before buying.

This is my favorite of all the Mowat Books that I have read (many but not all of his). It should be read in conjunction with "And No Birds Sang". Together they chronicle Mowat's WWII experience in the Canadian Infantry. Lots of interesting information and insights for the WWII reader, especially, for U.S. readers. I never knew that Canada never instituted the Draft (or, if it did, draftees could not be sent overseas to combat, I'm still a little unclear how that worked).Most importantly, the book gives tremendous insight into Mowat's character and helps the reader understand who it is that is experiencing or writing about the life that Mowat later lived. Of note is the fact that Mowat is quite short, a fact that one would not glean from his writing an exploits. The young twig is bent and later grows into the formidable tree.

These speakers seem to be sold under many brand names but they all look the same. The ones we got two years ago do not have a USB plug but run only on batteries. They have excellent sound for a portable and have held up well although not heavily used and not taken on many trips. Be advised that if your MP3 player has it's earphone jack on the bottom (as does my wife's older Nano) then it won't fit well in the cradle.Apparently, being so cheap, there are many defective ones but if you get ones that work they are a bargain.

I got this book after reading the reviews here. Unfortunately I read it after reading "Our Bones Are Scattered", a history of the Cawnpore massacre. "Our Bones..." is a much more detailed and vivid description of the circumstances of the Mutiny. "Seige of Krishnapur" was O.K. but I would not really recommend it except to someone with a particular interest in the Indian experience. I would recommend "Our Bones Are Scattered"

As wonderful as it is to hear these fine musicians play their instruments, there isn't a single song with words or music memorable enough that I want to listen to it again. None will withstand the test of time and become classics.
