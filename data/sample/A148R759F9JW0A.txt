This is surely one of the finest fantasy/lost race novels ever written. Back in 1969 during a parade I ran into a boy of 14 in the crowd and we somehow got on the subject of Merritt. He was an enthusiastic fan and told me that his friends shared the same tastes. He said that there was a paperback bookstore near his school where the kids hung out, and that was the place to find Merritt books. It would appear that in the 42 years since then, this fondness of boys for Merritt has somehow evaporated completely. It is their loss! The style of this book is taut, sparse, no-nonsense. Merritt comes right to the point. The action never lets up. There are two different endings to this novel, one forced on Merritt by his editor, and one by Merritt himself. I read the 1962 paperback and fear that this has the editor's ending, but in any case I liked it. I have no idea what the alternate ending is like. This title was included in Moorcock's list of the 100 best fantasy novels, and it deserves to be there. People whose idea of literature is realistic novels would find this book silly, childish and low-brow, a pulp thriller for teenagers. Well, they are partly right, but those of us who go for this sort of thing must consider this a masterpiece.

I first heard of this book when, at the age of 17, my best friend, a year older, told me about it. One year later, I read it as a college freshman. I have brushed up on it several times over the decades -- five decades to be exact. At first, to me it was simply a science-fiction novel. But as the years have rolled by, it seems to me that Orwell's nightmare has come true. This is true with regard to the endless wars, the shifting identity of the latest bogeyman, the lies that are our daily provender from all directions, the demonization of the individual, the internal spying, the hesitation to defy conventional thinking, the shifting definition of words, the dumbing down, state control of the media, the two-minute hate (called by another name, of course), all the jugglery with "truth" and so forth, it is all here and now. I hesitate to give concrete examples for fear that some of you will think that all of this is to be identified with certain factions, when in fact there is only ONE faction in our society, operating in unison like the tentacles of the octopus. It is not simply political correctness, it is everything. This is not something that can be voted out in an election. You will say that our students are taught this book as required reading, they have all been warned, we are on our guard, we cannot be deceived. You are deceived every day of your lives, you are surrounded by deception. You deceive yourselves in your very thinking. You think in Newspeak and do not know that this is what you are doing. I have seen this coming and it is before us and in us. You -- yes, even you -- love Big Brother.

This is an eyewitness account of an extended visit to Morocco in 1805 and 1806 by an English doctor. It contains a comprehensive account of life among the inhabitants, as well as the history and all other aspects of the country. I lived in Morocco in 1966 and 1967, and therefore read this account with the highest interest. There are a number of amusing anecdotes, such as the one about the Jew who was thrown to a hungry lion, but the lion refused to eat him. The reader may be a bit confused about Marrakesh being called Morocco, but it is from this that the country derived its name.

As a child, I saw the Disney movie when it first came out. Later, I read the Classics Illustrated (comic book) version. It was not until I was 23 years old and in the Navy that I finally got around to actually reading the book itself in the edition with the Wyeth illustrations. I found it to be a perfect masterpiece. Of course, I was already familiar with the characters and the plot, so nothing came as a surprise One oddity of my childhood was that I somehow managed to get through it without reading any of the classic books except in comic book form, so it was only in my twenties that I went back and read the actual books. I visited Scotland and toured a museum in Edinburgh devoted to Burns, Scott and Stevenson. Among other items, I remember that there was a rocking-horse that belonged to Stevenson as a child. Adults reading this book need to find an essay by Stevenson on the internet titled A Humble Remonstrance, which sort of goes with this book, but would be boring to a child. In the 1960s I remember being on a bus that was going along a causeway in Miami, and one of the artificially-created islands of the causeway was Treasure Island. There was a boy on the bus who said to his mother that he was sure that this was the real Treasure Island. Fortunately she didn't spoil his opinion with the rude truth. Recently I was talking with a trio of teenagers and told them that this was my favorite book. They responded in a rude fashion and declared that it was boring. I suppose that they had been forced to read it in school, a process which seems to invariably backfire in its well-meaning attempt to cast pearls before swine. Stevenson was looked down upon by intellectuals for a long time because he was popular and wrote for the young, but eventually even the snobs had to admit that he was a fine writer. The real treasure of Treasure Island is the book itself.

A modern reader may at first react to this beautiful book as if he had stumbled across the mummy of an antediluvian nobleman, complete with mummy wrappings in hieroglyphics that tell of life in the good old days before the Hittites came. But the Delta is not that of the Nile but of the Mississippi, and the Flood is not that of Noah but of 1927. The peasants are not the fellahin but the sharecroppers. This is the thrice-vanished world of the mint julep and the veranda, of Vardaman and Bilbo, of the Klan repulsed, the Belgians rescued, and Sewanee remembered. The style is not merely magnificent but perfect. The anecdotes are priceless. The tone is condescending without being aware of itself. The story of a besieged aristocracy in the midst of the wrangle between the Negro and the Redneck is gripping, although perhaps one could have wished that Percy might not have been quite so hostile to the latter. On page 99 of the Louisiana State edition, Percy quotes at length from a magnificent poem ("I dreamed last night of a dome of beaten gold...") and then calmly fails to identify the poet, as if it didn't matter. It was Stephen Phillips. There is a whole hilarious (except to the liberals) chapter on Fode, but the one thing that Percy doesn't say is that Fode was his boyfriend, along with some other black boys. Percy quotes none of his own poetry and tells you nothing about his homosexuality. He says nothing about his first (white) boyfriend, Harold Bruff. This silence is typical of the period. There is an introduction by Walker Percy that fails to convey the ingratitude that the latter felt towards his rescuer after the death of Walker's mother.

Back in the 1980s I saw a review of a Danish novel. I obtained a copy. There was just one little problem. I didn't know a word of Danish. So I got this book and the Gyldendal Danish-English/English-Danish dictionaries. I taught myself Danish and ended up reading and translating no less than five Danish novels, one of which was published.

I was just reading a recent article on Poe by some Brit named Kevin Jackson. He doesn't like Poe. He lists other Brits who haven't liked Poe: Aldous Huxley, Kingsley Amis, George Orwell, Owen Dudley Edwards. Of course, this probably has something to do with the fact that Brits tend to despise Americans in general. But Jackson admits that the French just love Poe: Baudelaire, Mallarme, Valery, etc. Baudelaire in particular worshipped Poe quite literally: he prayed to him. Poe's association with the French preceeded his writings: he met the Marquis de Lafayette during his teens in Richmond, when he escorted the elderly Marquis (friend of George Washington) down the aisle of a church. I'll bet you didn't know that! I own two biographies of Poe: one by George Edward Woodberry and the other by Hervey Allen, both of which I recommend. As to the tales and the poems, of course Poe is beyond criticism (in spite of the Brits). He was a genius and his writings are immortal. The young tend to be his greatest fans, as they are the greatest fans of Lovecraft. His very popularity tells against him among the literary snobs. The young don't read literary criticism, so they read as they please, and they please to read Poe. Poe is cool. You just have to be cool when you end a story thus: "Rip up the boards! It is the beating of his hideous heart!"

I first discovered that there was a man named Wilfred Thesiger one day in 1967 when I was browsing through the shelves of the English library near the Royal Moroccan Naval Academy. I found the book Arabian Sands and devoured it. I soon went to London and in a bookstore found a paperback copy of The Marsh Arabs, which I took back to Morocco with me and likewise devoured. Some of my American associates teased me about certain photos in the book, which are not in the American edition, although one of them is on the cover of the French edition. Some years passed, and I wrote to Thesiger. I received two letters from him, both nearly indecipherable. I had to stare for two hours at one letter before I could understand even one word written in his impossible handwriting. When I read The Marsh Arabs, the society which it described was still flourishing, I think, but not for long. This is a brilliant and vital book written by a man whom I consider to have been one of the giants of the 20th century; or should I say, "in" the 20th century but not "of" it ("in the world but not of the world"). Gavin Maxwell, he of the otters, also wrote a book about the Marsh Arabs and one needs to read both books if the subject is to be fully understood.

My ancestors, the Scottish highlanders, were long despised even in their own country as barbarians fit only to be exterminated or at least assimilated. This comes close enough to how the Irish were perceived. But I think that Ignatiev's use of the word "White" is easily misunderstood. He doesn't believe that there is such a thing as the White race. He is a Marxist and a Social Constructionist. Such people don't believe that ANY human category is real or fixed. He is annoyed at the Irish for failing to become Marxists when their proletarian roots theoretically should have driven them in that direction. I consider his ideological theories to be nonsense. This book is not really about the Irish, he is just using them as an example. He could just as easily have written a book complaining about Black assimilationists. He could have written a book titled "How the Blacks Became White."

I am in no position to judge the value of this particular translation. I read the first edition before the revisions were made. As a person coming from a Mormon background, I find this book to be structured like the Doctrine and Covenants, a Mormon scriptural book that consists of a series of revelations given to Joseph Smith in Kirtland and elsewhere. Here we have a series of revelations given to Mohammed in Mecca and Medina. The book is extraordinarily repetitious. Certain standard phrases appear again and again. I see no more reason to be upset about this book than about the Smith book. Either one believes it or one does not. There is no need to have a cow over it. In past centuries the Europeans referred to "the Alcoran of the impostor Mahomet" in sneering terms. Thanks to the events happening since 2000, there has arisen a sharp increase in Islamophobia in the West. I am writing this a day after the Toulouse event. One can hardly be objective about the Koran or Islam. In 1966-67, I lived for more than a year in Morocco, a beautiful and fascinating country. The people liked the Americans in those days. I came near to the entrance of an Islamic shrine and saw a sign saying "Interdit chiens et Juifs" but otherwise things were cool, except for a few Jews lynched here and there during the 1967 war. I saw the last Jews in Rabat before they fled to Israel, a Gypsy-looking lot who shouted "Auschwitz" at me as I passed through the Mellah (ghetto). I suppose they thought I was a German tourist. My introduction to Islam was pleasant enough and I cannot draw a connection between the terrorists of today and the Moroccans of 1967. The Koran is not an evil book, nor is Islam a cult.

If John Bunyan had been Scottish, he would have written this marvellous book instead of "The Pilgrim's Progress" and he would have been hanged for it. Fortunately for us, the spirit of the Covenanters drifted through the air for centuries, passing by James Hogg and George Macdonald until it alighted in the soul of one David Lindsay, perhaps mistaking him for the poet of the same name from long ago. This is drenched in the Calvinist spirit, but combined with a supremely rare genius wedded to a brilliant imagination. There is no other book like it, simply put. It is science-fiction only in the sense that C. S. Lewis could be said to have written science-fiction. Don't bother to try to figure out who or what the characters represent. Maskull is no more a person than Bunyan's Apollyon was a person. They are all allegorical figures and 17th century allegorical figures at that. This is what a Covenanter would have written if it had been legal in Scotland to write fiction in circa 1680. It was on a dark evening long ago that I was treading through the snow and entered the Georgetown Library. I browsed the science-fiction section and this book caught my eye. It was the edition with an introduction by Colin Wilson. I settled into a comfy chair and read the intro. I made a mental note to one day read the novel itself, for I was just passing through and could not check it out. One day I did read it and was absolutely overwhelmed. The feeling of awe that I was left with on the final page was unique in my reading experience.

Joseph Smith, Jnr., has never been given his proper due either by his friends or his enemies. He wrote the greatest fantasy novel of all time, but he called it scripture and forced his friends to deny that he was a novelist. He made so many mistakes and displayed such ignorance that he was mistaken either for a prophet or a fool, when in fact he was a genius who memorised the entire King James Version and could recite it from memory for hours at a time. He had a vivid imagination, the gift of being a great storyteller, and no sense of humor at all (see below). I have a theory that from time to time the Earth is visited by what I call Novas, extremely great men who pass like meteors in the heavens, throwing the human race for a loop. They tend to be sociopathic. Such an one was Joseph Smith. He was great regardless of whether the BoM was true or not. Yes, I have read the entire book. I know too much about it to believe any of it. Take, for example, the ninth chapter of Ether. This is the one flash of dry humor in the book, so of course the faithful don't notice the humor. Surely Smith was pulling the reader's leg when he spoke of "elephants and cureloms and cumoms." Too much has been written to disprove the BoM for me to waste space on this, other than to say that "the harlot Isabel, who leads astray the hearts of men" has a curiously Hispanic-sounding name for a supposedly Jewish woman who lived 16 centuries before the Spaniards arrived. If you want to believe in cureloms and cumoms, go ahead. Believe in the elephants. Believe in Hispanics in 79 BC. See if I care. But don't expect me to believe, and don't expect me to pay 10%.

The translator of the Penguin edition, Robin Buss, died only three years after the edition was published. His translation is very readable, and the introduction and notes are helpful. The story itself, although there are no supernatural elements, is essentially a fairy tale, complete with a happy ending. Dumas has an informal, naive style that would never pass muster if used in a novel today, but which I suppose was standard fare in those days. I found it all very charming.

Having just got finished with Black History Month and once again being annoyed that there is no White History Month, I now stumble across "White Studies." How did I manage all this time to miss this one? This is the usual crap. It is written by the usual radical leftists who identify the White race with what they call "racism" meaning (invariably) "White racism." I am so fed up with this obsessive denigration of White people! Those contributors who themselves are White are a sad bunch of self-hating losers. This whole book is disgusting. And yes, I have written the word White in this review every time with W instead of w. No, I don't live in a trailer park.

I eagerly awaited this film while it was being made, and at last, when it was shown at a local theatre, I went to see it. My experience was a disaster. The local newspaper had assigned the reviewing of this film to a homophobic woman with no culture. All that she got out of it was that it was about a homosexual, and she didn't like homosexuals, end of story. She scared off everybody from seeing it except for me and some rowdy, homophobic teenagers who apparently went to see it because the title seemed to imply that it was a murder mystery. I sat there for two hours in an otherwise empty theatre, listening to their hooting and catcalls, spoiling my enjoyment. As to the film itself, like all Visconti films, it was beautiful and slow-moving. Essentially nothing happens. A famous cultural figure goes on vacation, falls in love with an unobtainable beauty, feels frustrated, and dies. This sort of plot works in the novella (I have read it twice in two different translations), but as a film it fails. There is simply no action. The Swedish actor who played Tadzio grew up to be embarrassed by his brief experience as a pederastic sex object. Even while he was doing the film, Visconti showed him off to his friends in a way offensive to the boy. Years later, the actor was angered by his appearing on the dust jacket of a coffee-table book titled The Beautiful Boy.

Yes, I have read the book, but I read it long ago and my memory is not perfect. In 1988 I was persuaded by a college student (I was 44) to investigate the neo-Nazi movement. He had been persuaded by one of his professors to do the same thing. My adoptive mother was the daughter of Ukrainian Jews who came to Boston circa 1900. I was therefore highly unlikely to become an anti-Semite. Like everyone else, I took it for granted that Hitler was an evil madman, the ultimate bad guy of history. I therefore approached the reading of Mein Kampf and a bunch of other such books and publications, racist and anti-Semitic, with a bias against them. I found that Mein Kampf did not appear to me to be the product of a deranged mind. Economics bores me, and the economic parts of the book did not appeal to me. I managed to read the whole book with as much dispassion as possible ("with an open mind"). I had as a teenager seen many pictures of the devastation wrought by the Germans during WWII. The Nazis were not heroes to me. Nevertheless, I read this book and many others written by hardcore racists and anti-Semites. I learned to see the world from their point of view. I fell into the habit of "Jew-counting" i.e., looking at the masthead and table of contents of magazines to see how many Jews were there. There were a lot. I began to wonder whether the anti-Semites were not correct after all about the claim that the Jews control the press. This proved to be a slippery slope indeed. Although I have long since ceased to read such material, it still had a surprising effect on my outlook that has never entirely gone away. One does not have to be a bigot or a madman to fall under the spell of this sort of thing. A century ago, racism and anti-Semitism were quite common, not merely in Germany but also in America and elsewhere. Many, perhaps most, Americans used to believe that "the only good Indian is a dead Indian." I don't want to go off on a tangent, but I wish to point out that bigotry is not something that exists only among ignorant people. The eugenics movement was common a century ago, and it was widely believed that lower-class people should be sterilized i.e., exterminated. Hitler's mindset was not an aberration, it was typical of his time and place. Hitler did not invent genocide. The Namibians were butchered by the Germans when Hitler was young. As luck would have it, my landlord was a Jew at the time when I was reading this stuff, and his nasty disposition didn't help me to ward off the temptation to believe that the Nazis might have been correct on some points. I am trying to point out that you don't have to be a stereotypical trailer trash type in order to develop a social grudge of some sort. It is an historical fact that many Jews were Communists, and the Germans, Russians and Hungarians had to deal with them in the streets in a way unlikely to discourage a belief that Communism is Jewish. The Neocons of today are the children of yesterday's Communists. So, if you think that Mein Kampf is "the ravings of a lunatic," you understand nothing about the social background of the book. As for the style of this book being "turgid" (the favorite word of those reviewers who disagree with the message), this is a matter of opinion, and pretty much falls into the category of ad hominem attacks and terms of belittlement (such as drab, shabby, shoddy, etc.). As for the charge that this is a wicked book because it laid the groundwork for the Holocaust, one could point out that the vast number of human beings (yes, that's right, human beings) killed in abortion clinics since Roe vs Wade has been far greater than 6,000,000. To say that abortion is not murder is roughly the same as denying the Holocaust, is it not?

As a gay man, I found it quite painful, almost nauseating, to read this book. The pathetic attempt of the protagonist to conform to a heterosexual ideal of which he is incapable is doomed to failure. He wastes his own time and the girl's time. It is somewhat uncanny to realize that all this is happening in a nation in which, up until the 1860s, the samurai and the monks were happily and unselfconsciously practicing the age-old paederastic traditions of Japan. This novel is a classic exposition of what the late Warren Johansson called "spiritual murder."

It is painfully evident that the reviewers have paid absolutely no attention! This is NOT Don Juan by Byron, it is Don Leon, a pseudo-Byronic pastiche probably written by Thomas Love Peacock, and dealing with a defence of homosexuality. Reviewers, please look before you leap! In any case, this (Don Leon, not Don Juan) is one of the finest poems ever written on a gay theme, and includes extensive notes.

This historical novel was first published in 1899, then in 1929 it was revised, about 100 pages being cut out. It has an extremely complicated plot in which two sisters attract the attention of Henry VIII and Francis of France, leading to a great deal of fighting and running around. Although the novel has many real personages from history, such as Henry, Francis, Katherine, Wolsey, Anne Boleyn, Charles Brandon, etc., the events of the novel certainly never took place. The whole thing is served up in Shiel's typical unique style, filled with little tricks of alliteration and assonance. The dialogue is written entirely in Tudor English.

As a gay man, I come to this book with a grudge against at least one of its authors. Mr Prager has written an essay in which he says that homosexuals have no right to claim victim status, and that "homophobia" is an imaginary concept invented by radical gays to discredit criticism. How would he like it if I turned his own argument against him by saying that anti-Semitism is a false construct invented by the Jews to stifle criticism? That would enrage him, but he expects me not to be enraged by his blather. It appears that the reader is expected to believe that the Bible is literally true, especially the part about God's promise to Abraham. This is the rock upon which Zionism rests. We are also informed that the Jews are hated because they supposedly invented something called morality. Darwin smashed the credibility of the Bible in 1859, and Nietzsche demolished morality a few decades later. But what is Biblical morality? Isn't there a passage in Leviticus about how it's OK for a man to kill his wife after forcing her to drink a cup of filthy water? Is this the morality over which the authors gloat? What about slavery? I find the chauvinism and self-righteousness of the authors to be absolutely breathtaking. In Blanche Barton's Secret Life of a Satanist, there is a passage (between pages 50 and 60, I think) where the son of the Israeli Defence Minister cheerfully declares ... Well, look it up yourself. If this is true, it completely demolishes everything said in this book. And then there is that nasty little bit in the Talmud that contains the phrase "no worse than a poke in the eye." So much for the morality that has driven so many to hate so few.

John Meade Falkner is one of my favorite novelists. I have read all three of his novels, namely The Lost Stradivarius, The Nebuly Coat and Moonfleet. I consider him to be a perfect stylist with a vivid imagination who created convincing characters and gripping plots. It is too bad he isn't better known. Moonfleet is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Treasure Island or Kidnapped by Stevenson. I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't. One almost gets the impression that this book was first published as a serial in a magazine, since each chapter ends with a cliff-hanging situation, once even literally on a cliff. The old-fashioned language and the nautical terms will annoy many readers, but please try to get past this, even if you don't know your larboard from your starboard. It is well worth the effort. I admit that it was somewhat awkward to gloss over ten years on a chain-gang in a few pages, and the coincidence of the shipwreck happening exactly at Moonfleet stretches credibility to its limits, but one really must forgive Falkner for everything. A movie based on this novel was made in 1955, but it is very different from the book, to say the least.

I have never been into this scene, and never would be into it, for more than one reason. I used to be friends with a college professor of philosophy who was into this scene. I remember telling him in 1973 about seeing a copy of this book available at the local convenience store. My friendship with him soured after he tried to lure me to his apartment, apparently with intentions that I don't even want to think about. But I am not going to blame the whole community for what he was up to. Although I admit to having sadistic feelings, I have never acted upon them. What gets me about this scene is that it is supposedly a form of "sex" and yet it need not involve genital contact. I always thought that "sex" refers to genital contact. You know, the birds and the bees and all that. In any case, there seems to me to be a distinction between real sadism and this rather let's-pretend form of pseudo-sadism. Real sadism is Auschwitz. Anything that falls short of that is pseudo-sadism. Real sadism does not involve consent. To me, stuff like this book is merely an imitation of the real thing.

It is now fifty years since I discovered Mencken in my college days. I did not know what the heck a chrestomathy was, but it seemed to refer to books that were very large. As a Southerner, I resented Mencken's Sahara of the Bozart, and resented it all the more for the truth of it. But I figured that any man who admired James Branch Cabell couldn't be all that evil. After all, I had been born in Richmond and Cabell was from Richmond, so any friend of Cabell's was a friend of mine. On once again reading the Sahara of the Bozart (it had taken me some time to get the beaux arts pun), I am struck by the blatant racism of his mocking references to smaller European countries, such as Albania. But in those days there was no political correctness, and he would have lunged at it like a hyena if it had existed. I was disturbed by his vicious attitude about the death of William Jennings Bryan, who was guilty of attacking evolution. He was a mortal foe of Prohibition, inhibition and every other breed of 'bition that you can think of. He apparently slept with a cigar in his lips, a neat trick, but I am sure he managed it quite well.

James Boswell took his friend Samuel Johnson on a tour to Scotland in 1773, and both of them wrote books about the trip. The edition that I have is the one edited by Iain Galbraith and published in Germany (in English) in 2000. The only footnotes are Boswell's, and not only are they printed in very small print, but the modern reader is left hanging because Galbraith provided no footnotes. The Latin passages are not translated. The old-fashioned English sometimes has to be read twice before the modern reader gets the sense. For example, "there's an end on't" means "that's all there is to it." The reader gets a vivid picture of Scotland in those days, but it sometimes seems that the real focus is on Johnson. This book is a sort of prelude to Boswell's famous biography of Johnson.

It is so easy to forget the brief warning at the beginning where Hoffer says that the reader ought not to rush to agree with everything the author has to say. The reader is then immediately plunged into a relentless tide of aphoristic statements that are presented with a breathtaking certainty of tone that sweep him along to the very end, leaving him convinced that Hoffer was the wisest and most brilliant philosopher, psychologist, sociologist and writer who ever was or ever could be, the man who has all the answers and who explains everything. Well, not quite. One has to remember that Hoffer was a longshoreman, a drifter, at the very bottom of the social ladder for a long while. His university was the school of hard knocks. It is not everyone who comes from such a background that can rise to write such a book. Most of such people never even read books, much less write them. He was a product of a certain time and place, a certain social class, and perhaps a century from now he will be forgotten. His book has lasted sixty years, and it still sounds like the correct explanation, but although human nature doesn't change, perhaps there will come a day when somebody, somewhere, somehow, manages to find fault with this book and replaces it with something better. But I doubt it.

Although I am not a Jew, I know what it feels like to be on the receiving end. In 1971 I applied to rent an apartment and was shocked to be given an application that quizzed me about my race, religion and just about everything else. I was rejected and no reason was given. In 1987 I tried to rent at a large building with a for-rent sign. Two men were standing outside. One of them told me, "The apartment has already been rented. We forgot to take the sign down." Yeah, sure. I am old enough to remember when Arthur Godfrey (a popular TV personality) owned a hotel in Miami Beach that openly refused to cater to Jews. But upon reflection, Hobson's novel (and the movie) presented the problem from only one point of view. Just think about it. There are any number of Jews-only condos and closed communities. If a Jewish landlord in New York were to refuse to rent to Arab-Americans, then what? Don't Jews have "gentleman's agreements" of their own? Is discrimination OK if a Jew does it? Just askin'.

This is of course one of the great all-time sci-fi classics, but I think that it might be very easy indeed for a modern American to miss the point. This was not written by an American. It was written 120 years ago by a conceited and opinionated Englishman living in a very class-ridden society that seemed set in granite. The whole point of the book is based upon the assumption that there shall never ever be any inbreeding between upstairs and downstairs people, the rich and the poor. Thus the upstairs people gradually evolve into the sappy Eloi, while the downstairs people evolve into the brutal Morlocks. Oh, I must tell you, fifty years ago I lived not far from a building with a well in the front yard, and the sign said "Morlock Realty" -- no, not a joke, it was a splendidly comical coincidence that delighted me and my high school friends as we went past it every morning on the bus. Anyway, Wells was one of these really obnoxious upstairs types with an almost pathological contempt for downstairs people. This is why he presents the downstairs people as cannibals and all that. Anybody living in an open, fluid society would never have written such a book.

This translation was first published in 1975 by DAW Books, which is the edition I read (same text as this, I suppose). The good news is that this is, in its way, a brilliant feat of the imagination, especially considering it dates from 1854. The bad news is that it was not a work of genius, and is primarily of historical interest only.

At about the age of 13 I was rummaging one day in the closet and discovered that my mother had belonged to a book club, and here were all the books. The most interesting one was this one, complete with the dust jacket which showed that Anna didn't look anything like Deborah Kerr (nor did Mongkut look anything like Yul Brynner). I was fascinated by the book and read it three times. I saw the movie The King and I three times. I thought that the book was a biography, and that every word was true. Very many years later I discovered that this was an historical novel, that Landon had fiddled with the facts, and that the Thai people ("Siamese") were highly displeased with both Anna and Margaret. I even found a Thai woman to discuss this with. Well, I still loved the book and the movie. I know that Landon was guilty of Orientalism and made the King seem like an idiot at times, and the movie was even worse in this respect, but I had gotten my pleasure out of them before being let down. I do hope that it really was true that Mongkut had the uppity French ambassador seized by slaves and tossed out of the palace. I later met, or at least saw in person, the boy who played Anna's son in the movie.

This is perhaps the most elegantly written erotic novel of all time. Considering that it was written by a man, but from the female character's point of view, it is curious to think that all these luscious descriptions of the male body could be mistaken for Cleland's own opinions.

As is usual with Italian poets other than Dante, Stefani is totally unknown in the English-speaking world. I have a collection of his poetry books in Italian, plus this translation by Anthony Reid with illustrations by J. Martin Pitts. I myself had the honor of being Stefani's first translator. I corresponded with both Stefani and Reid. Stefani is one of my favorite poets. People really need to learn Italian so as to explore writers who are rarely translated. Stefani killed himself ten years ago. I was not expecting this and was quite shocked. The theme of his poetry is the same as with Sandro Penna, namely ragazzi. This effectively puts him out of the sympathy range for about, oh, 99% of possible readers. But fine poetry is fine whether you like the theme or not.

The author says that the greatest sin is murder, and yet he devotes less than one page to discussing it. He then proceeds to devote three chapters in a row to sex sex sex. He devotes an entire chapter to teenage petting and necking. He says that homosexuals are no more than one per cent of the population, and yet devotes an entire chapter to them. He is very ignorant about the nature and causes of homosexuality. His attitude towards it is venomous. A homosexual should avoid that chapter as he would avoid a rattlesnake. But let us come to the main point. The Christian/Mormon concept of sin is a fake concept. There is no angry or forgiving God in the heavens who is watching your every move. The moral code was invented by men, not by divinities. You don't have to feel guilty or repent of anything within the context of religion. It is of course true that criminal behavior needs to be repented of, but only within a secular context. You may ask your victims to forgive you, but there is no God who has to forgive you for anything. Crime exists, but sin is a fake concept. Pardon me if I repeat myself, but this is the one essential point to understand. You don't have to ask for forgiveness from some imaginary deity who can neither save nor damn you. Thus the whole message of this horrible book is false, was false, and will forever be false. There is no pie in the sky waiting for you after the church has cleaned out your bank account.

Prior to the removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental illnesses in 1973, it was quite common for psychiatrists to write toxic drivel like this, combining bizarre theories with fire-breathing homophobia. Bergler was the very worst of a bad lot. It is impossible to read this rubbish without seeing how extremely hostile Bergler was to gay people. Gore Vidal opined that these shrinks had been raised by mothers who wanted them to become clergymen, so they took a moralistic mentality with them into the field of "medicine."

This is a coffee-table book, and the main use of it is found in the numerous nice pictures of buildings and the landscape. The text by Blundell is useful but cannot take the place of scholarly works. The focus skips about a bit, and I do wish that the section on whiskey did not look so much like free advertising. The poetry section contains a number of typographical errors here and there. There are no examples of Scottish painting, even though it is a pictorial book.

Most of the text of this fascinating novel involves the adventures of one man who is absolutely alone in the world. It is not everyone who can handle a novel with only one character, and this a character who of necessity must be insane. Shiel manages to deal with this very well. He mitigates the horror by having the millions of dead bodies fail to rot or stink. The ending is rather sentimental. It might have been more effective if Adam had not met his Eve.

I read this book when it first came out. I had already developed a passion for history as a child, and had become fascinated by gladiators as a result of seeing a couple of movies on that theme. For those teenagers who complain that the study of history is boring, try Mannix and you'll never see history as dull again. This is as exciting as the best historical novel.

This long-forgotten book was published in 1875, and was written by the American ambassador to Spain 1867-68. John Hay was Lincoln's private secretary, and he was the Secretary of State under McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt. It was Hay who was responsible for the treaty ending the Spanish-American War. This book deals with his impressions of Spain while he was ambassador. His rather narrow mind saw vice in the very faces of Catholic priests. There was a later, illustrated edition.

The author is more interesting than the book. Cuthbert Vail Wright (1891-1948) rubbed elbows with famous writers such as Cozzens, Cummings, dos Passos, etc., while remaining in the shadows himself. He was a poet and an educator. A fellow teacher at his prep school described him as "flamboyant, taking an Oscar Wilde pose, affecting a long cigarette holder, holding court for selected boys who interested him." Wright often pretended to have been born in 1898 or 1899, but it is more likely that the year was 1891 or 1892. He was an Episcopalian when he wrote this book.

The somewhat mysterious Aleko Lilius (1890-1977) was Finnish, but described himself at various times as Russian (he was born in Russia), Swedish, English and American. The pirate queen in this book was the inspiration for the Dragon Lady in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates. There were indeed pirates in the South China Sea in the 1920s, and there was a movie China Seas in 1935. But since the globe-trotting Mr Lilius apparently didn't know Chinese, how did all these conversations take place? This book is fun to read, but it comes across as a pulp fiction thriller.

Tangier was one of my favorite places to hang out when I was living in Morocco in 1967. Bayer drenches this novel in homophobia until it stinks. The local boys are being exploited by rich foreign pederasts who abuse and toss aside all of the boys, until finally there is a revolt. Yeah sure. When was the last time you heard of hustlers riot against their customers? The police chief tries to get rid of the foreigners. All of the pederasts are portrayed as cynical devils. The author seems to have a socialist agenda, which he combines with homophobia.

The big mistake that is made about Flaubert is to classify him as a realist, when in fact he was a romantic. It is universally declared that the whole worth of this volume resides in 'A Simple Heart', the only realistic tale. My heretical take on this is that it is the romantic tales 'St Julian' and 'Herodias' which give this volume its worth. Far from being the best tale, I consider 'A Simple Heart' to be the least interesting tale, a boring tale that has been admired only because of its realism, as if realism were the be-all and end-all of literature.

This is an English translation by the late E. A. Lacey, based on the French translation by the late Rene Khawam, of a book called Les Delices des Coeurs. But this is only half the book. The other half consists of heterosexual anecdotes. The Khawam book was brought to the publisher's attention (Winston Leyland) by Stephen Wayne Foster, but Foster is not given credit in the book. Khawam invited Foster to translate the heterosexual half, but this was not done.

This book is apparently intended to be a challenge to moralists, i.e. the author has a "political" agenda. I am not qualified to judge the data presented in this book. The only time I ever witnessed animal homosexuality was back in the 1960s when my family's poodle and the next door poodle, both male, would get it on with each other in front of us. Having been written and published by homosexuals, there seems to lurk around this book more than a hint of propaganda. The data presented here do not merely strike a blow for gay lib, but strike at the very heart of our understanding of the universe. It is to be remembered that the religious/moralistic view, not merely of sex, but of everything, is based on the assumption that everything has a purpose, but this purpose can never be pleasure. Also, the Bible says that God created the animals, fish, birds, etc. solely for human use, and not as ends in themselves. One would like to ask what purpose is served by tarantulas or life at the bottom of the ocean beyond human reach. Indeed, Mark Twain pointed out that the oceans themselves seem to serve no purpose, or at least not a human one. But if the author's (or reader's) purpose is to use the data in this book to justify human homosexuality, may I humbly point out that non-human life has all sorts of habits that don't carry over too well into human society, e.g., eating their young, predators ("Nature red in tooth and claw"), and so forth. While you are busy thinking of non-human sexual behavior in terms of what "nice" animals do (zoo penguins, for example), just remember that a human predator could seek to justify his behavior by detailing the behavior of sharks, jackals, hyenas, etc. We know that the praying mantis kills and eats its sexual partner. Does this fact justify a human being doing such a thing? Animal or insect behavior is not, and cannot be, a justification for what humans want to do. Thus, to wave this book in front of your parents and say "This book proves that gay is OK" is ridiculously simplistic, and overlooks vast areas of non-human behavior that are horrible in a human context. Also, the hint that "fun" is a proper and natural purpose for sex strikes me as a trivialization of the meaning of life.

Although I have read the book, let me start with the 1905 ad quoted above. This is obviously nonsense. The influence of this book has probably been much less than claimed, and to say that presidents read this in manuscript is ridiculous. Now to the book. This is based on Nietzsche, but the style is overblown and hysterical in a way that one never finds in Nietzsche. It is certainly not watered down, however, to say the least. The author essentially gets it right, but he screams it out instead of quietly trying to convince the reader. As literature, this is nothing compared to the writings of the Scottish poet John Davidson (Mammon and His Message, etc.). It is all barking and snarling. I think that we are expected to believe that this book was published in 1896, but why then is there a reference at the very end to the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898? In any case, the author seems never to have risen to the top of the heap, or anywhere near it. If this philosophy did not work for him, how will it work for you? When did he ever have any "might"?

It is unfortunate that the fun of this book was spoiled by the tragedy that followed in the lives of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, causing the author to withdraw the book. I feel that Neil McKenna in his biography of Wilde goes too far in blaming Hichens for Wilde's downfall and for portraying Hichens as self-loathing. This book is an hilarious satire on Wilde and Douglas, full of insider knowledge based on the author's friendship with them. He catches the tone and lilt of Wilde's style to perfection.

If people like Katz would just stop and take a look at their bodies and think about the implications of their anatomy, they might not write such nonsense as this. Let's take it from the top. All gendered species, whether human, animal, bird, fish or insect, are OBVIOUSLY designed with procreation in mind. There would be no point to gender except within the context of procreative intent. I understand that the wording of my remarks - "designed", "in mind", "intent" - seems to imply a god who created the species, designing them with intent in mind. You will then tell me that my remarks make no sense from an atheistic viewpoint, and perhaps you would be correct. Yet, god or no god, gender still makes no sense outside of the context of procreation. Therefore, all gendered bodies are procreative bodies, and all procreative bodies are heterosexual bodies, including the bodies of all gay men and lesbians. There is no such thing as homosexual anatomy. I am a gay man and all my sexual partners have been male, nor do I repent of my behavior, but what I have done with men has been done with a heterosexual body. You are what your body is. All bodies are heterosexual, therefore everyone is heterosexual, no matter what you do in bed or with whom you do it.

This curiosity, written in a turgid style, will be of interest to the student of Mormonism, and to the student of the esoteric and the bizarre. With regard to the Book of Abraham, for those who refuse to accept the new translation of the papyrus, let me say that the third illustration shows a crowned figure seated on a throne, with a female behind him, and three figures facing him, one of whom is a female. Joseph Smith in his caption identifies the two female figures as male. It is evident that (a) Smith didn't know the difference between male and female costumes in Egypt, and (b) the caption is patently false, and (c) therefore we may suppose, on the basis of this caption alone, that the document as Smith presents it is a fraud.

Kupelian is of course associated with the birther-nut website World Nut Daily. Although I am a pro-lifer who would agree that abortion is evil, from there on I lose contact with Kupelian. He tries to appeal to the sort of ignorant people who think that science is a conspiracy because it has demolished the credibility of Genesis. He lives in a fantasy world where the human race is only 6000 years old, homosexuals and Palestinians are devils, Obama was born elsewhere, and so forth. Let us take one assertion, the one that no culture would condone homosexuality if it were not for an ad campaign by radicals, elitists and pseudo-experts. Oh really? Homosexuality was widespread and accepted in ancient Greece. How many radicals, liberals, atheists, elitists and pseudo-experts were there running an ad campaign in ancient Greece? Not many! Were Plato, Socrates, Aristotle and Alexander the Great a bunch of devils? Did God destroy Athens or Sparta with fire and brimstone? Nope! For those of you who would say that Greek civilization declined and fell because of homosexuality, let me point out that every civilization declines and falls sooner or later. Just as human bodies wear out and die, so it is that political bodies also wear out and die. This has nothing to do with morality. Kupelian and his Clown Car gang can demonize everybody from Darwin to Kinsey, from Obama to Ron Paul, from homosexuals whose rights were stolen to Palestinians whose land was stolen, and he can yell as loud as he wants to that They're out to get your momma, but it's still the same old rubbish.

I read this silly book years ago, and the one thing that sticks in my memory is the part where she says that lesbians literally glow in the dark, and she knows that this is true because she has seen lesbians doing this. Oh, yes, there was also the part where she says that she is an intellectual (sic) and she has figured out that the word "bulldyke" supposedly comes from an ancient British queen's name. Practically everything in this book is along these lines. She is not an intellectual, she is a hippie. What she has to say is mystical nonsense combined with a gay essentialist theory that says that all gay and lesbian people are mutants with supernatural powers of some sort. I do not believe that gay people are born that way or that they are mystical mutants. The enthusiasm aroused in the gay community by this book is hopelessly misplaced. The message of the book is comforting only to those who consider themselves to come, so to speak, from outer space. But if it is really true that lesbians glow in the dark, why, we could hire them to serve as street lamps whenever there is a power outage.

Homosexual behavior is illegal in Papua New Guinea and especially if the younger partner is less than 17 years old. That of course means that all of the sexual behavior reported in this book was illegal. This is presumably why Herdt disguised the identity of the tribe. He didn't want to set the men up for arrest. Several reviewers have justified this by saying that it is standard anthropological practice to protect the sources. But it seems to me that here we have a blatant double standard. The Catholic church has practiced extensive coverups with regard to priests having sex with boys. The officials at Penn State did the same thing with Sandusky. This has provoked universal outrage. How are anthropologists exempt from having to report such behavior? Who has exempted them?

This is the earliest of four novels that have been written about this disturbed genius. This novel appeared in 1968 and was followed in 1997 by Doubting Thomas by the Norwegian writer Atle Naess; in 2003 by Caravaggio by Christopher Peachment; and in 2012 by A Name in Blood by Matt Rees. The Payne book is the first and still the best. If one compares this novel to biographies of the artist, one sees that Payne has condensed what might otherwise have been a narrative twice as long. He fiddles around a bit with the facts, but the main outline is faithful to the general reality. This is not intended as a biography. Payne risked losing readers by avoiding much of the violence of the artist's life. This is not The Three Musketeers. The novel is well-written, and is presented from the artist's viewpoint, as a sort of autobiography followed by a brief, ironic postscript. It is amazing that Payne, who wrote 110 books, could produce so fine a novel in the midst of churning out an endless flow of other books.

I had already read this novel before the Oklahoma City bombing and recognized the novel as the inspiration for it before the government said anything about the novel. It seems to me odd that the similarity between the climactic scene in the novel and the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon has been ignored so much. I mean, like, if you have a novel that culminates in a fanatic crashing a plane into the Pentagon, and then the exact same thing happens in real life, surely a few people ought to notice the similarity. As to the novel being "poorly written" according to those who disagree with the author's politics, let me point out that practically all of the "great" writers of the 20th century were alcoholics or communists or both (usually both); and when you turn to the lives of the critics who put these writers on every "required reading" list in creation, it turns out (surprise!) that all of the critics were alcoholics, communists and personal friends of the endorsed authors. So don't preach to me about "poor writing" because I'm not listening. This is a political tract and is not intended to win plaudits at New York cocktail parties.

This is a comprehensive study of Portuguese literature up to around 1920. It says nothing about Fernando Pessoa. It is as boring as a textbook. Bell deals with every possible aspect of the subject, and presumably actually read most or even all of what he discusses. It was his thankless task to introduce English-speaking people to a literature which was substantially unknown to them, and to write the book just before the greatest Portuguese writer, Pessoa, came to public attention.

In this lurid but poetic description of the epic battle between Good and Evil from the early Middle Ages up until 1731, it soon becomes evident to the reader that it was the Satanists who were the good guys and the Catholics who were the bad guys! The Satanists were simply Nature-worshipping pagans, while the Catholics, the Inquisition etc., were cruel hypocrites who literally demonized the pagan gods and tortured and executed the pagans. Michelet leaves the Middle Ages far behind in the latter part of the book, giving us the astonishing details of the Cadiere-Girard case of 1730-31. One finds it hard to believe that these people really existed and these things really happened!

This has long been a twice-told tale, nor is this the best telling. I read this book immediately after reading 'Sacrilege' by Leon Podles, and the France book clearly comes in second place by comparison. This is, after all, written by an editor from Newsweek. You can't expect such a writer to know how to write. All this gay stuff like the Stonewall riot is completely out of place in such a book. As for this being the Catholic church's worst nightmare, may I humbly point out that the church's worst-ever nightmare was the Protestant Reformation? You know, the little matter of the loss of all of northern Europe? The Catholic clergy has always been fond of boys. This has never really been a secret. The idea that we just found out about it a few decades ago is nonsense. Where have you all been, that this took you by surprise?

The authors of this dreadful book were a pair of journalists who wrote a series of similar books, all dreadful. On the one hand, historians may welcome various facts about old Chicago which one is not likely to find anywhere else. On the other hand, the book is absolutely rancid with every sort of bigotry imaginable. There was no category of humanity which the authors didn't despise. Such a book could never get published today.

This was written about a century ago. It consists of a series of naive folk tales told by an Italian peasant boy named Toto. This is not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it to be delightful. The personality of Toto shines through every page and he himself is the main character. The subtle humor of the book helps to make it a pleasant read.

The avowed purpose of this book is to blame white people for what black people do. If you were to read books about the way that black people acted in Africa before they became slaves, you would find the same violence that is found today in the black slums. They didn't "become" violent as a result of being moved from Africa to South Carolina, they were violent from the beginning. Have none of you people ever heard of tribal warfare?

The name of C. S. Calverley won't ring a bell with anyone these days. He was a Victorian comic poet who was very amusing, and it is your loss if you don't know about him. His parodies are particularly delicious.

This is the fascinating autobiography of a desperate opportunist who tried to stir his way through Nazi Europe against all odds. The cover of this particular paperback is extremely lurid and gives the would-be purchaser a totally wrong impression of the contents.

As a gay man, I naturally sympathize with Buttino. However, as a former gay activist, I have an issue with gay men or lesbians who want to work for a government that is sometimes hostile to them. During the early period when Buttino was infiltrating radical organizations, these organizations included ordinary gay rights groups. I was a leader of one such group that was infiltrated by FBI agents who, fortunately for us, were obviously what they were, thus putting us on our guard. What if Buttino had been one of these agents assigned to our group? Where was his loyalty, to the FBI or to his own people?

I was introduced to Surikov and his splendid historical paintings more than fifty years ago when I was in high school, as several of them were included in the book An Illustrated History of Russia. These were in black and white and the images were small, so that I thought of them, not as works of art, but merely as illustrations. I now realize that he was indeed a great painter.

This silly book first appeared in 1972. Duffy knew a lot about imaginative literature, and the book is admittedly informative, but then she went and spoiled everything by applying silly Freudian explanations for every poem, play, novel or fairy-tale that she deals with. She saw incest, castration, phallic symbols, and all the rest of it in everything covered. A general collapse in the credibility of Freudianism has left this book sounding like the ravings of a woman with a dirty mind.

Although an annotated translation rather than an original book, this oddity deserves the attention of all lovers of the books of T. H. White, author of 'The Once and Future King' which served as the basis for Disney's Sword in the Stone and the musical Camelot. Here you have pious nonsense served up raw but delightfully. The medieval folk lived in a sort of fantasy world without realizing it. White was a gentle soul who is not here to make fun, or not too much fun, of the idiocies of the Middle Ages.

I would have given this book six stars if it were possible. This will never be taught in universities. The critics and academics don't know about it, and if they did know about it, they would say that it isn't realistic or leftist, and therefore should be ignored. Edward Wagenknecht mentioned it in "Cavalcade of the English Novel" long ago, but nobody listened. Edmund Wilson would have done a hatchet job on it. It is as out of sync with the modern spirit as it is possible to be. It views the world through the same eyes as those of Homer's warriors or of the Vikings. Nietzsche would have understood. I need hardly repeat the objections to Lessingham and the childish names of the kingdoms. This is not Mercury. But it doesn't matter. The reader basically has to imagine that this book was really written by Shakespeare and the manuscript somehow got mislaid for three centuries until Eddison found it and pretended that he was the author. I don't want to go off on a rant about the modern world, but there was a time when the vox populi was silent amid the clash of steel; the only value system that counted was that of the elite; and not an elite that went to Oxford or Cambridge, but an elite that went to Troy or Carthage or Persepolis or Xanadu. At about the age of thirteen, my hero was Genghis Khan. It is in the spirit of such a choice of heroes that this book was written.

When I was 18 (50 years ago), I was introduced to this grossly overrated poet. I preferred traditional poetry, and did not even have much use for Whitman. I forced myself to read all of Eliot's poems. The mind shudders at the very thought. I much prefer James Elroy Flecker, whose poetry is completely different and so much better. Perhaps some of Eliot's prose writings deserve to survive, but he just isn't a great poet.

I hesitate to add my two cents after so excellent a review by another person, but here goes. More than fifty years ago, when I was in high school, I tried to read this novel in paperback, having an almost fanatical interest in the Byzantines. I was, however, annoyed that Waltari had added a love story to the military narrative that I expected, and after one love scene I became enraged and threw the book against the wall, refusing to read any farther. Finally, after a half-century I got a copy of the old hardcover and read it through to the bitter end (and the ending is bitter). Not perhaps the greatest historical novel ever written, but accurate and absorbing. The moody hero adds an unusual note to a novel written when other historical novels were bodice-rippers with lusty heroes saying things like "Zounds, wench!" The villain, Sultan Mohammed II, is a fascinating study in Machiavellian ruthlessness and duplicity. The real Anna Notaras wasn't even in Constantinople at the time of the siege, much less involved with a man.

This is the spin-off from the movie. I lived in Morocco for more than a year 1966-67. I became very familiar with the land, its people and its history. A few years later, I went to see this movie and was dismayed by the historical inaccuracies, the absurdity of selecting an actor with a thick Scottish accent to play a Moroccan, and the blatant jingoism. If you don't know what "jingoism" is, look it up, or, better yet, if you think that Teddy is your kind of president, just ask yourself why you like a foreign policy that keeps us bogged down in endless wars in the Islamic world. As to the inaccuracies, well, for example, the Sultan was older than he is shown in the movie; waiters with knives in their backs do not tend to continue walking with the tray in their hands; there was no evil Bashaw of Tangier, and in any case the word "bashaw" is a 17th-century form of the word "pasha"; Teddy did NOT send the Marines to Morocco, they did not shoot down the bodyguard of the imaginary Bashaw, they did not force him at swordpoint to do anything for them; etc. etc. It is true that there was a locomotive in the Sultan's palace, however. I was an eyewitness to an event in the real world that casts a bright light on the sort of attitude that has gotten us into Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. I was on a train going across the Moroccan landscape, and we passed a cemetery. A young American leaned out from the open doorway of the carriage and urinated towards the cemetery. Imagine how you would feel if an Arab urinated on an American cemetery, and then reverse the situation and ask why so many foreigners hate Americans.

Bachofen was a Swiss writer of the 19th century who is remembered for his theory that patriarchy and monogamy were preceded by matriarchy and promiscuity. He sets this matriarchy in pre-literate times in order to account for the fact that there are no written records to prove his theory. But the lack of recorded proof could just as easily be accounted for by assuming that the theory is false. The present condition of society in American inner cities resembles the matriarchy that he described. However, there is no goddess-worship in the inner city. There were goddesses in ancient times, but this doesn't prove his theory.

I became aware of Noel Garde (Edgar Leoni)in 1969, when I saw him mentioned in an article by Dick Leitsch of New York Mattachine. I ordered the book some months later from a bookstore. The woman at the store gave me a dirty look when she handed the book to me. It consists of brief (and sometimes not so brief) biographies of 300 famous men in history who were perhaps (or perhaps not) gay or bisexual or whatever. Garde was not a professional historian and it shows in his bibliography of sources, which includes historical novels. Much space is wasted talking nonsense about the imaginary homosexuality of such figures as Vasco da Gama, George Washington, Napoleon, George III, etc. There are no men from China, Japan, and a whole raft of other nations. All 300 men are Caucasian. The USA is the only nation in the Americas from which Garde takes sources. Africa, Australia, etc. -- they don't exist. This, then, was the very rocky start that gay history studies got in the good old days. One might as well have asked Hugh Trevor-Roper to have written the book (HTR said that Africa had no history prior to the colonial invasions. I suppose that one should be glad that Garde didn't tell us that Columbus was gay. But credit should still be given where credit is due. Nobody else dared to write such a book in those days.

I grew up in a society in which the world of literature was dominated by the critic Edmund Wilson, who loathed fantasy. All of my literature courses in college were based on the assumption that novels are supposed to be realistic, naturalistic, modernistic, everything that I hated and despised. The success of Tolkien led to Wilson's tyranny being swept aside (almost like the overthrow of the communist dictatorships in 1989) in a tidal wave of popular revolt that resulted, among other things, in Lin Carter becoming the Pied Piper who led college and high school students out of the swamp of Wilsonianism and into the sweet meadows of high fantasy. I will be forever grateful to Carter. I bought this book early on and still have it. It has its faults, notably Carter's dishonesty about the private lives of Beckford and T. H. White, but it is still the best guide, and it is too bad that it is a paperback original long since out of print.

I discovered Kipling at about the age of ten, when I was at a summer camp and a grown-up sat under the tree with us boys and read us "Rikki-tikki-tavi." At the age of 17 I obtained a two-volume selection of his writings and went totally nuts over his poetry. It was not meant to be read, it was meant to be recited or sung. I would walk back and forth in my den chanting "The Ballad of the King's Mercy" (about the Afghans). This was fifty years ago. When I was 22 and in the Navy, I would catch guard duty and march up and down the dusty, silent passageways of the instruction building at night, singing "Mandalay" as the mice or whatever scurried out of my way. How prescient Kipling was! His poem "The Truce of the Bear" tells you all you need to know about a war that started long after Kipling died, the Russo-Afghan war that ended (or did it?) in 1989.

Two gay men get high and under the influence of marijuana, pornography and homosexuality, they rape and murder a boy of twelve. The father goes after them and all three die violently. This novel reads like a tract from the extreme right, demonizing marijuana, pornography and homosexuality by connecting them with a horrid crime, and giving the reader the broad hint that lynching is the solution to all such things.

I was alerted to this charming book by an essay on it in the writings of John Addington Symonds. Fortunately it was later (later than Symonds) translated by Edward Morgan. It deals with feuds in Perugia, often overlooked by those who think that the Renaissance only happened in Rome, Florence, Venice, etc. It appears that Symonds was attracted to this book by certain passages which suggest that the upper-class youths of Perugia tended to have homosexual relationships among themselves.

The fame of Madame Bovary has for so long overshadowed Salammbo that it needs to be said that it is in Salammbo that one finds the real Flaubert, the orientalist and decadent sadist, the romantic. This is one of the truly great historical novels. It is, in a way, the sort of novel that Nietzsche or Robert Ervin Howard might have written. It is not -- I repeat, not -- a condemnation of what it depicts. The barbarians and Carthaginians are what Flaubert wants them to be. Flaubert was not a lover of middle-class or Christian virtues. He did not have "your" values. He gives you blood and guts because he wanted blood and guts. He was not nauseated by what he wrote, or else he would not have written it. The world is too tame by half. This book needs to be preceded by a reading of Ragnar Redbeard's Might Is Right. Flaubert's values were "fascistic" in the wider sense of the word. It is too bad that he didn't follow this up by writing a novel about the Aztecs or the Mongols or Tamerlane. The meek shall not inherit the Earth!

The author is by no means well-known in America today, and yet this is a masterpiece that deserves a wider readership -- wider than one (me). It is obviously about the tragic relationship between Peter the Great and his son Alexis. The main plot is alternated with a subplot about religious fanatics who see it as their duty to burn themselves up, although they have a hard time working up the courage to do it. The world of St Petersburg in its earliest days is brought vividly to life. One sympathizes with the hapless Alexis, who flees to Italy, only to be lured back to his doom.

I suppose that the Sayers version is one of the best, although I have not read the others and therefore cannot compare them. This is a very gory book. The author, monsieur Anonyme, must have been a sadist, as he wades in gore on every page and goes into extreme detail about the killing of every Moor that the paladins can get their hands on. His hatred of the Saracens cannot entirely account for the almost monotonous kill kill kill descriptions we have here. One after the other the Moors are beheaded, dismembered, lanced, sworded, battle-axed, what have you. This is not a book for pacifists.

This is a long article, not a book. I have just read it on the internet. It dates from 1982. As a white Christian male living on a very tight budget in a very small apartment, I was particularly amused to see that "all of the power and money are concentrated in the hands of white Christian males." This woman is truly delusional. Is she really going to tell me that there are no powerful and wealthy Jewish women? Has she no power or money? And she is particularly delusional in her surprise upon learning that so many feminists of all stripes are anti-Zionists, as if every woman in the world ought to applaud the Big Heist because the Eternal Victims needed a place to stay. If you were at home and the house was suddenly invaded by a group of homeless women with guns who threw you and your family out on the street, justifying their takeover of your house on the basis of the "moral imperative" that was theirs by right of being homeless, should the Feminist movement applaud them simply because they are women? If you say that the Jews have a right "of Return" -- hey, sixty years ago I lived as a child in a mansion. My father lost his job and we had to move. Consciously using Jewish concepts, I thought of myself as "wandering in the wilderness" until my family was able eight years later to move into another nice house in the "Promised Land" i.e. the same suburb as before. But did I ever have the right to invade the original mansion at gunpoint and steal it from the new owners, simply because I had once lived there?

When I was 17 years old in 1961, I was suffering from depression, probably due to the fact that I was gay and living in a society that considered people like me to be "sick." I went to a shrink who immediately recommended that I be put away in the mental ward of the local charity hospital. I went there with my mother and we were both horrified. It was one of those snake pits that used to exist, and perhaps still do. There was only one entrance/exit door, and it was normally locked, i.e., it was a sort of prison. The screens on the windows were rusted over, and of course there were bars on the windows. The place was so filthy that a cockroach crawled across the bed I was assigned to. The patients were zombies. I was ready to make a run for it when my mother decided that her son wasn't going to face this dreadful fate, and we fled. In 1945 there was a young gay man arrested in Tallahassee for soliciting, and he pled Not guilty by reason of insanity, based on the opinion in those days that homosexuality was a mental illness. He spent the next TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS in the Florida State Hospital For the Criminally Insane. They didn't let him out until 1972. He was 23 when he went in and 50 when he was released. "How shall it be with kingdoms and with kings, when this dumb terror shall reply to God?" (Edwin Markham) Albert Ellis said that Szasz was a hippie. I say that he was a saint and a hero.

Garbage in, garbage out. I consider psychoanalysis to be a set of ridiculous and false doctrines invented by a hoaxer and charlatan named Sigmund Freud. Thus, to attempt at the distance of 200 years to read the mind of the Sphinx of Nauvoo, and to attempt this reading within the context of Freudian humbuggery, is to turn truth on its head. The question is, how does a fraudulent system serve as a context for proving that another system is fraudulent? People in glass houses throwing rocks!

When I went 40 years ago to see the Visconti film based on this novella, I was shocked upon entering the theatre to find it entirely empty except for a small group of punks who apparently had come because they thought it was a murder mystery. The local newspaper had frightened off the adults by publishing a venomously homophobic review. All through the film, the punks kept hooting at the screen once they realized what it was about. This little episode in my life was perhaps a needed bucket of cold water thrown in my face to remind me that culture in this country is a very small island in a very big and rough sea. I have read two English translations of DiV, but the only translation of it that I own is, oddly, a Spanish one. I do not think that a modern author could write such a story today without having a heap of angry reviews complaining about glorifying pedophilia. Let it be noted that the Library of Congress now classifies this work as being "child sexual abuse -- fiction." Never mind that von Aschenbach never gets beyond an idealized infatuation, his merely gazing fondly at Tadzio is the Federal government's idea of "abuse." And of course the Visconti film is also now classified as "abuse -- films." This is one of my favorite works of fiction. It was presented with such good taste by Mann and Visconti. And I try to forget that Bjorn is now a grumpy old man who doesn't want his image as a youth to grace the dust jacket of any coffee-table books.

This once popular book was written fifty years ago, and is not only hopelessly outdated, but was never "indated" in the first place. I remember as a gay college freshman sitting in a class near a girl with the paperback edition of this book. She started pointing at the various males and counting to six. I ducked. The only thing I remember about the contents is the absurdity of Stearn saying that gay men seemed to die young, and he could prove this by saying that he never saw any older men in gay bars.

There comes a point in the process of habitually trying to discredit Mormonism where the critic finally goes off the deep end and believes any nonsense that puts the Church in a bad light. The Tanners obviously reached that point with this book. At least 90%, and more like 100%, of all the claims about Satanic ritual abuse are fictional, and the idea of this sort of thing, if it exists at all, happening among Mormons is truly ridiculous.

I developed agoraphobia at age 30 in 1974 after my parents died. I didn't know what was going on until I accidentally came across this book about a year later. But although I read it, I did nothing about it until 1992. Why? Because ultimately, the only way to overcome agoraphobia is to confront it and suffer until it goes away. You can't learn to swim without getting into the water. You can't desensitize yourself to the world beyond your safe area without leaving the safe area, and leaving it is going to hurt. It took me a year and a half to go four miles on weekly walks. In the middle of that struggle, I got bogged down for eight months between 21 Avenue and 19 Avenue. Yes, it took me eight months to go two blocks! But I made it, and in the following weeks went forward at the princely rate of one block a week. Then it happened! I realized in the midst of this snail's pace that I was going to be free, I was going to be victorious! And I wept endless tears of joy on the way home each time. At night, I was in my bed and endless tears of joy swept down my cheeks as my whole body shuddered so violently that I had to hold on to the bed with both hands. I was delirious with joy. I knew ahead of each trip that no matter how painful it would be, the pain would be followed by convulsions of joy. I therefore looked forward eagerly each week to the pain, for the greater the pain, the greater the joy. It worked! I forged ahead gradually, but a much accelerated pace, and the world opened up before me. I took busses and then walked, sometime seven or ten or even fifteen MILES in one walk. My safe area became an empire! I worked my way by bus and train and on foot until the empire extended 130 miles from north to south. Do you want to know what it felt like to be standing at a certain spot and realize that you are 100 miles north of where you live, and you are not having a panic attack? Just ask me, for I have been there and done that! The years rolled by. With the help of people with cars or vans, I made it from Miami to Orlando, was able to go each week to Orlando and back again without anxiety. But as the Chinese say, the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. The first step is the tricky part. But take that first step even if you are terrified, or else you are condemning yourself to a sort of prison. Religious faith helps, and it helped me, but even if you are an atheist, don't stay trapped, get out there and live! At one point fairly early on, I came to a canal with a high bridge. Not only was I dealing with agoraphobia, but also fear of heights and fear of water. Over a period of months, I kept coming back to that bridge and trying to cross it, but losing my nerve 12 times in a row. On the 13th try I made it across. NEVER GIVE UP!

This is a history of the Egyptian ruling class from 1250 to 1517. Actually, they were not Egyptians, but Albanians and what have you, imported into Egypt. Glubb had an intimate knowledge of Arab countries and would have studied histories written in Arabic. So here you have the whole story -- except for the one essential matter, namely the fact that homosexuality was widespread among the Mamlukes, and the whole social system of the ruling class depended upon it. Glubb was properly British, and could not bring himself to mention this, even though he must have known about it.

I was just reading my own review of this book, which was written when the book first came out. My review was pretty strident, to say the least. I have had some thirty years in which to cool off. But although I won't repeat my objections from the original review, I still have something to say. Of course her essential message is that you should raise your kids to be liberals, i.e., Democrats. This in turn means that she thinks that you, the parent, ought to be a liberal, i.e., a Democrat. So where does this put the parents who are conservatives, libertarians, anarchists, or whatever? Why should your effective parenting skills depend on your political opinions?

This is a short book written by a Jew in 1945. He said (p. 27) that homosexuality is "a virus that poisons the whole life-blood of human existence." He goes on to detail certain historical facts regarding homosexuality in the history of the Germans -- the Teutonic Knights, the scandals of the Kaiser Wilhelm period, the assorted gay men in the Nazi movement, etc. Of course he presents the Germans as being nothing less than devils during their entire history. He tries to connect homosexuality to the essential character of the German people. This is not to say that many of the facts that he presents are not true. Homosexuality has been as widespread in Germany as it has been in other nations. But the way he presents these facts and the conclusions that he draws from them are odious. Sometimes it is hard to tell whether he wishes to damn the Germans for being gay or to damn the gays for being German. This book is the ultimate source for The Pink Swastika book that seeks to demonize homosexuality for its supposed link to Nazism, and to demonize the Nazis for their supposed link to homosexuality.

Charles Higham ceased to cumber the Earth with his mendacity on April 21, 2012, when he did us all the big favor of croaking. He left behind him a long list of gossipy biographies full of lies and half-truths. I became an enthusiastic Errol Flynn fan at the age of 14 in 1958, when there was a series of re-runs of Flynn movies on TV. I lapped them up like a cat at a bowl of cream. Flynn was still alive at that time. His pattern of sexual behavior hardly indicates the possibility that he was bisexual. As for the Nazi spy nonsense, this is so ridiculous that there is no need to refute it.

The earlier material is what gets presented in literature textbooks, and it is excellent. The rest of the volume consists of a series of incoherent prophetical books which are based on a private mythology. I actually managed to wade through the whole thing, possibly a sign of masochism. One is left numb after reading all this. It may make sense to people who take the time to study it carefully, but I moved on to other writers. I have read the complete poetry of three Romantic writers, Keats, Scott and Blake. Keats and Scott make sense. Blake is another matter.

During the Satanic craze among teenagers, this was considered to be the ultimate book -- by those who had never read it, and who assumed that the Satanism of the title was the Satanism of the teenagers who sacrificed cats or whatever. On the contrary, this book is simply a cross between Ragnar Redbeard and Hugh Hefner, between Halloween and Playboy. It avoids having anything good to say about real Satanism. It urges atheistic hedonism with a few Gothic trappings added to give it style. In short, Lavey was a Satanist in the same way that Spong was a Christian, neither of them believing that God or Satan really exist. Lavey would have been the first to denounce the cat-killing teenage Satanist types who "give Evil a bad name" as it were.

It is most unfortunate that only a handful of reviews of this book appear here. The younger generation needs to know about these people. The variety of these people ranges from soup to nuts. I was a friend of Bob Basker, and am disappointed that his work with Miami GAA is barely mentioned. I also met Kameny and Troy Perry, and stood near Ginsberg without speaking to him (all in 1972). Those were heady days. These potted biographies, in many cases, are likely to be the only ones to ever appear on specific persons.

Like so many others of my generation (born 1943), I felt when this first came out that it was the living end, and I have had plenty of time for this impression to wear off. The songs of course made the show, so just reading the script doesn't give you any idea of what this was like as a cultural bombshell. For those of you who may wonder why these guys never had another hit, I can tell you as an eyewitness. I forget the year, but the same guys who gave you Hair later created a hopeless piece of trash called "Billy Hill" which was so bad that it's not even mentioned in the wikipedia articles on these guys. It opened at the Coconut Grove Theater in Miami, and it lasted only a brief while before closing. I went to see it and I just couldn't believe just how b-a-d it was. Either Ragni or Rado, I forget which, was in the lobby with a hippie girlfriend, a big hulking oaf arguing with the manager about getting the girl a free ticket. I should have known that there was something wrong just by the fact that the musical was opening in Miami instead of New York.

Homosexuality is only a problem for those who make it a problem. Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador; it should be outlawed everywhere. If you have a problem with your homosexuality, then just take a vow of chastity and keep it. Don't bother trying to get rid of it. Your relationship with your parents has nothing to do with it. All arguments against homosexuality are ultimately religious in origin; they are moral arguments. The use of medical concepts is merely an attempt to hide the Biblical origins of self-referent homophobia (gay self-rejection). On top of which, of course, is the fact that the therapist is trying to make money out of this.

If you can find it, fans of Motley need to get their hands on a book edited by Ian Young called 'Overlooked and Underrated' (issue 12 of Little Caesar, but it takes the form of a book). This contains a wonderful essay on Motley by Maurice Kenny. He says that Nick Romano was based on three boys known to Motley, Portuguese, Irish and Mexican. Kenny describes Motley's life in Mexico, and the sort of person he was.

In its time (1951), this book came as a bombshell, especially as it appeared in the midst of a witch hunt. Anyone who wants a view of gay life then would do well to read this book. That is the good news. Now for the bad news. Donald Webster Cory (and not "Daniel" Webster Cory as Troy Perry insisted on calling him) was really Edward Sagarin, a physically impaired man who apparently identified with Quasimodo, and whose self-loathing knew no bounds. Far from being the leader of the gay movement of his day, he rejected every good thing that liberal experts had to say about gay people. To the bitter end, he agreed with the idea that gay people are deviants, that they are sick, that homosexuality is a "problem." He would today probably be a spokesperson for some 'ex-gay' group. He was, in a word, a collaborator.

I own a copy of the first edition and just flipped through a copy of the expanded edition at a bookstore. Neither edition has much to say about homosexuality, and what it does say refers to the present and not the past. As a gay man who helped Jonathan Katz to write his massive book "Gay American History," I am indignant about the way in which Davis has so much to say about women and racial minorities, but so very little -- almost nothing, really -- about homosexuals. I sent him an e-mail some time ago, but he never responded. In the expanded edition, he has a little more to say about homosexuals since 1980, but the only mention he gives prior to 1980 is a very unsatisfactory discussion of President James Buchanan's possible sex life. Apparently Davis never heard of Gay Studies. The Katz book appeared some 20 years before the first edition of the Davis book, and none of the extensive material in the Katz book appeared in either edition of the Davis book. Davis seems, or pretends to seem, totally unaware of the name of Buchanan's lover, namely William Rufus King, senator and Vice-president of the USA. Presidents Jackson and Polk were on record as making snide remarks about Buchanan and King. And Davis has the nerve to claim that there is no conclusive evidence! If such phrases as "Miss Nancy" and "better half" are not conclusive, then what is his idea of conclusive? And he says that the source on Buchanan is Barney Frank, who is not a scholar, thus deliberately sabotaging the credibility of the assertion.

As a Scottish-American, I was annoyed at the tone of this book, which is essentially written from the enemy (i.e. the English) viewpoint. We get no glee from Prebble when the Scots win at Bannockburn, and we get no sympathy from him when the Scots lose at Flodden. There is really no need for a Scot to read this book unless he is practicing his self-hatred, otherwise known as the Scottish cringe.

As a play, this is all talk and no action. Of course, the action could not have been presented on the stage in any case, especially not back in those days. Assuming that my memory is not playing tricks on me, I went with a friend to see the movie version very shortly after it dawned on me that my admiration for a handsome boy in my math class meant that I was one of "those" people. This hit me like a bombshell, all the more so because I was 15 and this was the first and only available movie on the subject. I had access to no information at all, and didn't know any better. So I went to see the movie and was informed by it that people like me are lurid and sinister weirdos whose faces are never shown (on the screen), who have odd names like Sebastian, and who invariably end up being eaten alive by delinquents upon whom one has been preying with the aid of female bait. Needless to say, I left the theater devastated, looking forward to a hellish life and a strange death. I am now 68 years old and have not yet met with such a death. Not yet.

I was in Naval Intelligence during that period. I was assigned to a naval land base in the Mediterranean area. I was standing next to a radioman while he was in contact with the Liberty during the attack. I could just as easily have been assigned to the Liberty, and if I had been, I would have been on the ship when the attack came. I could have been one of the dead or the wounded. Even if I was not hurt, I would have been an eyewitness to the death and wounding of my friends. I leave you to imagine my feelings about this book, about Israel, about AIPAC, about the congressmen who stand up and cheer Netanyahu when he speaks, etc. Some years ago, I wrote a letter to the editor of the local newspaper about the attack on the Liberty. It was published on the 4th of July with a black border around it and a photo of the ship. I soon received a letter forwarded to me by the editor, a letter from an "Irish sailor" who lived in a nearby city mostly inhabited by Jews. He invited me to come up and have a beer. Yeah, sure. I would have been found dead by the side of the road.

This shortish book is probably the best introduction to Objectivism for college students. I read this when it first came out and was overwhelmed by it. I have had plenty of time in which to become less pleased than I was. It is a collection of essays by Rand and Nathaniel Branden. The effect of reading it is roughly similar to being run over by a tank. I still own the very copy which I read so long ago. I think that the last essay is the most useful, 'The Argument From Intimidation' having stood the test of time. I am not an Objectivist, however. For one thing, I am gay and therefore by no means pleased with Rand's homophobia. Secondly, Rand and Branden were/are Jewish, and the Objectivist movement has been basically taken over by Zionists, a movement I detest. Thirdly, her rant on Racism is very offensive to me, if only because it would imply that Scottish-Americans (such as myself) have no right to ethnic pride or collective identity. Fourthly, Branden went off and founded a therapy cult which I distrust. Fifthly, I have seen all 3 segments of the Mike Wallace interview, in which Rand comes across as obnoxious as possible, strident, harsh, dogmatic, enveloped (along with Wallace) in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke, giving off a vague impression of being a ranting lunatic. The same impression is to be found in this book, except for the cloud of smoke.

This is one of a series of books taught to the LDS faithful in unison, with the material arranged by subject. Grant was the father of the Prohibition Amendment, but the faithful voted in favor of repeal, an amazing act of insubordination that simply would not happen today. It was Grant who switched the Mormons from being Democrats to being Republicans. He didn't order them to switch, but a hint among Mormons is often (correctly) seen as an order.

I am a 68-year-old gay agnostic who has been in and out of belief over a long period, and it has been hard for me to avoid reducing all of Christianity to a roadblock on the highway to equal rights. But there is more to it than that. Yes, I have read the entire Bible. I have read the Koran, the Book of Mormon, and so forth. My considered opinion is that Christianity thrives on low self-esteem. If you read Hoffer, Rand, Branden, Nietzsche and so forth, this is what you come up with. The central message of Christianity is that you (regardless of who or what you are) are worthless, a miserable sinner, doomed to Hell were it not for God's whimsical fondness for you in spite of your utter worthlessness. I fail to see how you can get anything out of such a message other than low self-esteem. Grace sounds nice until you figure out that it makes sense only if you agree to feel utterly worthless. If you follow the line of argument, you are supposed to put yourself into the same category as terrorists and serial killers and other scum, and then marvel at "the grace that so fully He proffers me" as the hymn-writer put it so nicely. It is almost like a lullaby, and so easy to fall for it if you already had low self-esteem to begin with, even before you were told that you couldn't possibly ever deserve any good thing that you receive. It is almost like the scene in 'Oliver Twist' where Oliver asks for more lousy food and is met with indignation and outrage.

This contains all the poems and many of the letters of one of the greatest poets of all time, a man who died at the age of 25 and yet ranks with poets who lived much longer. There is no telling what Keats might have accomplished if he had not died so young. He was too good for this world.

I lived in Morocco for more than a year in 1966-67, and from time to time travelled all around this beautiful, fascinating land. I saw its problems at first hand. Unlike Howe, I didn't rub elbows with the rich and famous. I saw the bidonvilles (slums) of Casablanca with the tin shacks. On a train, I passed some peasants living in caves. I saw haggard women staggering down the road under a load of firewood while the men in the village were sipping tea and chatting, and while other women were down by the creek beating the laundry on rocks. I was not a tourist. This was during the much-maligned Years of Lead, the days of Hassan II and the dungeons, disappearances, and so forth. I am an archreactionary, however, and firmly on the side of the Makhzen approach. I have no sympathy for women's rights, democracy, reform, progress, or any of the rest of that sort of thing. The Moroccan royals dropped the ball in 1912 and were almost swept aside, having to call in the French, who made mistakes such as providing the Moroccans with paved roads, electricity, sanitation, and that sort of thing. What was Lyautey thinking of? Howe has been in and around Morocco a lot more than I, but she is a Westerner and a believer in progress, as well as hobnobbing a bit too much with the elite. Mohammed VI would do well to remember the fate of the Czar, the Amir of Bukhara, the Sultan of Zanzibar, and a whole raft of other monarchs who should have cracked the whip more often. The poor we will have always with us. There is no point in trying to do away with poverty in a place like Morocco. It can't be done, nor should it be done even if it were possible. Morocco should never have been Frenchified, much less Americanized.

Many years ago, I was a member of MCC and personally met Troy Perry. At that time (1972-73) I admired him, although I was a bit put off when I tried to discuss the Bible with a MCC deaconess, only to hear her say (quote) Gee, I don't think the Bible mentions homosexuality. (unquote) It is this sort of ignorance and wishful thinking that attracts people to MCC. It is ironic but not surprising that Perry's own tastes have been unwittingly denounced by the MCC members.

This book starts out fine with a well-deserved condemnation of the ethnocentrism of Western historians who write a history of Europe and call it a history of the world. The rest of the book deals with "our" Oriental heritage; but who are the "we" implied by the word "our"? It turns out, of course, that "we" are Europeans and the European diaspora. So the very first word in this book is ethnocentric. What Durant gives us is pretty much what your high school world history textbook used to give you circa 1960. Flipping through the remaining volumes of his Story of Civilization, he abandons all of his good intentions as proclaimed in the first volume, and devotes himself entirely to Western Civilization, narrowing his focus in the later volumes to France: Louis XIV, Voltaire, Rousseau, Napoleon. He gets Asia out of the way in the first volume and then makes a beeline for Greece, Rome, etc. You just know that even if he had lived to be a hundred, he would never have devoted volumes to Africa or Latin America or Australia.

This is the best book on the subject, and I cannot imagine how it could be surpassed. Every Scottish-American should own a copy. In recent years it has been suggested that the information in this book, or any similar book, is somehow imaginary. As you know, the tartans were outlawed from 1746 to 1783, more or less. It was only in the wake of the immense popularity of Sir Walter Scott's writings 1810-32 that the tartans were revived. In 1822 George IV visited Edinburgh and everybody was frantic to appear in plaid. Walter Scott was in charge of the whole affair. We are now being informed that Scotland, Scottishness, tartans and all the rest of it were somehow "invented" by Scott in 1822, and that the clans prior to 1746 never used the system described in this book, the system of each clan having its own plaid pattern. Then supposedly some enterprising merchants invented fake patterns to meet the demand, and these fake patterns are the ones in this book. I am not saying that this is true, merely that this is the theory, which if true, would render this book a sort of delusion. See Hugh Trevor-Roper's book on the Scots and keep in mind that Trevor-Roper was a bigot.

I read this book in 1967 when I was living in Morocco. I was thus familiar with the land and the people. As a Scottish-American, I respect "Don Roberto" (as the Argentinians called him) as the founder of modern Scottish nationalism. However, I was somewhat put off by the flippant tone that he used in this book. Nevertheless, it is valuable as a sketch of Morocco in the good old days before the French came in 1912. One should compare this to Gavin Maxwell's "The Lords of the Atlas" or Walter B. Harris' "Tafilelt" for alternative views of the same region during the same period.

Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador and denounced by the American Psychiatric Association. It consists of tormenting brainwashed homosexuals until they reach some unrealistic point where they think they are beginning to please an unpleasable God. The late Warren Johansson rightly denounced this sort of thing as spiritual murder. Barnhouse's theory of the cause of homosexuality is complete nonsense.

The paperback edition has the title What Every Homosexual Knows. This was published almost fifty years ago, so some of this may appear rather quaint. Benson (a pseudonym, certainly) starts out with chapters dealing with the claims that homosexuality is unnatural, sinful or sick. He proceeds then with further arguments. Viewed in the light of current doctrines, the one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb is the idea that "homosexuality constitutes one choice among several ethically defensive choices wherein one may select his own way of sexual life." Compare this to the current dogma that homosexuality is in ALL cases invariably a result of biological or genetic flukes, that all gay people are born that way, they can't help it, they would never choose it if it were a choice, etc.

Although I am a gay man, I do not agree with the liberal arguments that say that the anti-homosexual passages in the Bible have been misunderstood, along with the passages about women, blacks, etc. The Bible was not written by liberals. It was written thousands of years ago by men who lived in a world where things like slavery and the subordination of women were taken for granted. Jesus never said that women were equal. Jesus never said that slavery was wrong. He had plenty of time to say these things, and He did not say them. At the end of the story of Noah, it says that Noah got drunk and his son Ham "uncovered his father's nakedness," for which Ham and all his descendants forever would be "cursed" with black skin and be the slaves of others. This is the part of the story of Noah that they never mention in church, but it's right there in the Bible. It says that black people are black because of homosexuality -- not their own homosexuality, mind you, but the homosexuality of their distant ancestor. So either you believe all this or you don't. Sweeping it under the rug won't make it go away.

Every educated and serious gay person ought to read this work, although the price is enough to limit the sale of it to the few, and the few never heard of this book. Two comments only: the facts about the Duke of Devonshire were completely overlooked in the standard book on the Devonshires, and the vague reference to a popular English novelist with a failed marriage refers, not to Dickens, but to Bulwer-Lytton.

This paperback lay on my shelf for many years among the other books until I just finally got around to reading it. It turned out to be one of the most brilliantly written novels I have ever read. The other reviewers here have generally already said whatever needs to be said, so I won't repeat it. For anyone fascinated by this novel, let it be pointed out that Stewart, under the pseudonym of John Davis, wrote about the background of his life which greatly adds to the readers' understanding of the novel. This essay is to be found in Philip Toynbee (ed.), Underdogs (New York, 1962), pp. 78-95.

It is interesting to note that we live in a society that sees the epitome of evil in the destruction of 6,000,000 Jews by Hitler, while we pay no attention whatsoever to the destruction of 7,000,000 Ukrainians by Stalin. So of course Dworkin compared the abuse of women to the Jews and not to the Ukrainians. Dworkin is Jewish, so one would expect the Jewish comparison, but still, I personally am sick of hearing every evil person compared to Hitler and not to Stalin. So now she tells us that all men, men as such, are Nazis. Ho-hum, yawn. Please pass the butter. This thing about women being, so to speak, the chosen gender (cf. the chosen race), is too silly for words. She suggests that women should go off and form a nation by themselves, and have nothing more to do with men. Oh, really? And just how is the human race to continue to exist under such conditions? Where are the children supposed to come from? Did she even stop to think about this? Did she even care?

Of course you will say that the laws of Nature were invented by the God of the Bible, the God who said that male homosexual behaviour was "an abomination" -- laws of Nature supposedly invented out of nothing a mere 6,000 years ago. Then you will tell me that these laws of Nature are a penal code that can be violated, and that sodomy is just such a violation. Well, if the laws of Nature can be violated, then just how do you violate the law of Gravity? Can you choose to ignore gravity by a simple act of will-power, floating up into the sky? OF COURSE NOT! The laws of Nature cannot be violated as if they were a penal code. Everything that exists is ipso facto natural. Please don't give me the old "carrot in the ear" argument. This book is just more of the same paranoid stuff you get on World Net Daily, the chitchat about the Agenda.

I was introduced to G&S by my sixth-grade teacher, mr Miller, who was more interested in music than teaching, and later came to a bad end. I did not, but survived to read the complete libretti (not "librettos"). Gilbertian humour suited my taste, and Sullivan's music was delightful. I used to listen to recordings. There was a time when I could sing from memory a number of the songs, such as "The Duke of Plaza Toro."

I understand that Dworkin had reason to fear and hate men. She was molested as a child. Her first husband abused her horribly. But she wasn't molested by all men, nor was she spouse-abused by all men. She had no right to generalize about half of the human race on the basis of what two -- count them, TWO -- men did to her. It is not clear to me whether she "was" or "became" a lesbian. It is a notorious fact that Dworkin fit the stereotype of the man-hating lesbian with a vengeance, and her physical appearance could easily lead to the accusation that no man would have her, and therefore she resented them and switched to women. But I used to work with a woman who was the same physical type as Dworkin, yet was neither a feminist nor a lesbian, and certainly not a man-hater. This woman was happily married. The message I get from all of Dworkin's writings is that all men are devils except for the gay ones, that men have no rights, and that all women should turn lesbian and sail off to some large island where the absence of men would somehow cause an earthly paradise to flourish. This completely overlooks the fact that there is such a thing as lesbian spouse abuse.

The authors of this magnificent book deserve the greatest praise for daring -- and yes, "daring" is the correct word -- to write this book on a very controversial subject in the midst of an extended period of moral panic in the West. Since practically nobody in the West has even the slightest knowledge of, or curiosity about, Turkish love-poetry written prior to 1800, this book has probably gone largely unnoticed and unread, and has therefore gone uncondemned by moralistic pundits. It is true that the authors have played it a bit safe by giving a genuflection before the altar of right-mindedness, saying in so many words (I paraphrase), "Well, yes, this whole book is about the very abomination of desolation, and of course we don't approve of what these beastly poets were up to, but we took it into our heads to write at length about it anyway." And goody for them for doing so!

This appeared a century ago at a time when there was zero sympathy and understanding for homosexuality, and the author, who was the executor of the Symonds estate, shamelessly covered up the truth about Symonds, even going so far as to destroy material. More recent books on Symonds have broken the conspiracy of silence, thus reducing the value of the Brown book to nothing.

This book sticks closely to the historical sources, and if it is filled with horrible events, it is because the events really happened. It reminds me of Flaubert's Salammbo. The reader can hardly overlook the style, which obtrudes to the point where I had to use my Latin dictionary. The introduction by Campbell is excellent and seeks to reconcile the reader to the obscurities. There is supposed to be a Marxist subtext lurking behind the narrative, but it isn't too obvious ("You have nothing to lose but your chains.") The other two novels about Spartacus, by Howard Fast and Arthur Koestler, were also written by Marxists. I myself have never been sympathetic to Marxism, but I was able to read this without annoyance.

This is not everybody's cup of tea, to say the least. It is not even a novel but a sort of bizarre unstageable play. St Anthony is in Egypt and hallucinates everything possible. The reader is not likely to understand all of the esoteric references. Flaubert's writings are easily divisible into the realistic works such as Madame Bovary, Sentimental Education, etc., and the romantic works such as Salammbo and St Anthony. It is virtually impossible for the reader to like both types equally. St Anthony is one among a number of French historical novels dealing with Egypt, such as Thais, Aphrodite, Romance of a Mummy. It is the sort of book that ought to be illustrated by Gustave Moreau.

There have been many books about Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, but this differs from the rest by concentrating on the sexual aspects of their lives to the exclusion of much else. I think that the author gets a bit carried away at times in seeing sexual implications in all of Wilde's books. The author refers to Bosie's mother as Sybil Queensberry, when in fact she was Sybil Douglas. Queensberry was her title, not her surname. Bosie's father was a Marquess, not a Marquis. There is a photo among the illustrations captioned "Bosie and friend." On the contrary, the "friend" is Lord Drumlanrig, Bosie's brother. Much is made of information supplied by Frank Harris and T. Backhouse, both notorious liars. In this age of moral panics, the author is courageous in his frankness about the pederastic tastes of both Oscar and Bosie. It is easy enough today to laud Oscar as a "gay martyr" when he has been safely dead for 112 years. If he and Bosie were alive today and behaved in the same manner, the gay community would distance itself from them because they were the sort who "give homosexuality a bad name." (as if it ever had a good name)

As an elderly gay man who sides with the "enemy" on this issue, I have heard all of the arguments that gay spokespersons have dreamed up in an attempt to morally legitimize homosexuality. As far as it goes, I agree with Helminiak that the ancient peoples did not have a concept of sexual orientation as we know it, and therefore the Bible is not speaking about "homosexuality" in our sense. What it condemns is "homogenital" sex acts. But so what? Up until fairly recently, homosexual acts were against the law in some American states. These laws refer only to homogenital sex acts, and homosexuality was not forbidden in the form of an abstract condition. If thus it is possible to say that the Bible did not outlaw homosexuality per se, this proves no more than is proven by the fact that homosexuality per se was never against the law in those states where homogenital acts were oulawed. Thus, if one asks whether homosexuality was ever forbidden in America, the answer is "yes and no." In the same way, if one asks whether the Bible forbids homosexuality, the answer is again "yes and no." The real question is one of obedience. I know very well that in the old days when homogenital acts were outlawed everywhere, there was probably not one gay man anywhere who ever refrained from breaking the law simply because the law existed. Gay men wilfully violated the law. They were criminals. They did not wait until the law was changed before doing what they wanted to do. They were disobedient. In the same way, the so-called "gay Christians" have tended to break the moral code without waiting for it to be changed. They are disobedient. It seems not to occur to them that disobedience is a sin in and of itself. If God has not come out of the sky and announced that the rules have been changed, then it is required of Christians to obey the rules whether they agree with them or not. John Boswell died of AIDS in 1994 because he was disobedient, and yet his book is cited even today by people as some sort of proof that what he was doing was OK. Well, if what he was doing was OK, then why did he die from it?

Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics ("ye murder to dissect"), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality. In short, this book is nonsense.

If it were not so tragic, it might almost be amusing to notice the parallel between books that tell you how to overcome SSA with the aid of Mormonism, and books that tell you how to overcome Mormonism with the aid of Baptist anti-cult "healers." I wonder if there are any gay/lesbian Mormons out there who learned how to escape from SSA, and then learned how to escape from Mormonism? If you can leave one thing, you can leave the other thing! If you unleash the dog, there's no telling where it might wander.

I have coined a term, Paedocaust (or Pedocaust, if you prefer) to denote the sexual holocaust that we have long been aware of. This Sandusky scandal is probably the biggest one of this sort to hit the sports world since 1997, when a scandal erupted in the world of Canadian hockey. But this thing has been going on in sports for ages, as witness Big Bill Tilden in the world of tennis long ago. Of course we are not going to "save the children" by abolishing sports any more than we are going to save them by abolishing the Catholic church or the Boy Scouts or the educational system. Although children tend to be segregated from adults in various ways in our society, somebody still has to mind them. We cannot lock the children up 24/7 like dogs. Charities will still have to operate to serve the needy children, and somebody has to staff them. Putting women in charge of boys doesn't seem to work, the women are in this game just as much as the men. I was thinking that perhaps we ought not to glorify men whose only talent is to chase a ball around in some manner or other, but whether it be a football, a tennis ball, a hockey puck or whatever, something is still going to attract boys, and the men who are attracted to boys will still be there. The cover-ups will persist. Plato said 2,500 years ago that men who love boys ought to love them platonically ("platonic" being the adjective form of Plato), but the idea, the counter-idea, that "sex" is a game where one scores a point for every sexual partner (a hundred partners, a hundred points) has led us down an increasingly muddy path, once known as the primrose path, to this situation that we all find ourselves in, where children are points in a dirty little game, and not our brothers to love and protect.

Maybe you should read Eric Hoffer's book 'The True Believer' before reading the Tanners. They are not trying to rid you of your desire to be a true believer, they are only trying to get you to switch to something else in which to truly believe. Even if I agree with all of the facts as they present them, I still find it fanatical on their part that they should have devoted so much time and energy to trying to destroy their former church, simply to get you to become another type of holy roller. Nobody but a fanatic would sit there with two different editions of a 600-page book and count all the discrepancies, all 4,000 of them. It would amuse me if they got to Heaven only to find a flagpole by the pearly gates with a banner flying from it decorated with a crescent and star.

Voltaire said "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." What Lipstadt is saying is "I disagree with what you say, and I want you to spend seven years in prison just for saying it." I was born in 1943 and I have no personal knowledge of the Holocaust. I only know that many say that it happened, while a few have said that it did not happen as others claim. As a person who believes in freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of opinion, I find it outrageous that, with regard to this one historical event, laws have been passed to silence all doubters. Only if we posit the idea that the Jews are a Sacred Cow that must be protected from all criticism forever, can we agree that freedom of speech, the press and opinion must be denied to the deniers, but to no one else. Perhaps this makes sense in Israel, but this is America. It is the victors who write history, and we all know that lies have been told by some of the victors. Hearst lied about the Spanish on the eve of the Spanish-American war, for example. We have long since ceased to believe that the Spanish interrogated naked women in Cuba. What if there was a law that threatened people with prison for doubting Hearst? What if this law were to remain in effect forever? How could an honest history of Cuba be written while such a law hung over the necks of the historians? If the Holocaust really happened as we have been told, complete with the six million and the gas chambers, why is there a law against doubting it? Specifically speaking of the Germans, during the First World War, the allies claimed that German soldiers habitually killed Belgian babies with their bayonets. This is no longer believed by anyone. Perhaps there were other claims about the Germans that were also equally untrue.

In 1969-70 I had the pleasure of taking a course in ancient Chinese history taught by the late John Knoblock. I found it fascinating. We had to consult translations of the original chronicles, and I became familiar with the world that is likewise presented in the present book. Every intelligent person ought to read at least one of these chronicles, if only to balance a view of the ancient world that otherwise might be dominated by the Greek and Roman historians.

Why read that stuffy puritan Milton when you can read Herrick? I am tempted to commit the heresy of saying that Herrick was the greatest English poet between Shakespeare and Pope. Herrick's world is a fantasy Arcadia in which fair (but apparently imaginary) maidens frolic in an elegant manner. He was a goldsmith, a vicar and a poet. He never married.

I first encountered this essay in my high school library, attached to a 3-volume translation of the Arabian Nights. It gave me vitally-needed information about gay history at a time (1961) when this sort of information simply didn't fall into a teenager's lap. Many years later I wrote an essay, "The Annotated Burton", which was published in Louie Crew's The Gay Academic, and which has been completely ignored ever since by Burton scholars and gay scholars alike. My essay shows that much of Burton's scholarship was downright sloppy, such as misspelled names etc. In 1990 I wrote the article on Burton for Wayne Dynes' Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, and of course this has also been ignored.

Although I am an agnostic and have posted reviews critical of religion, I cannot agree with the idea that a belief in the supernatural is the same thing as being crazy. Worse yet, Ellis is notorious in my mind for vulgar, slangy pop-psych advice-column approaches to mental health issues, using words like nutty, kooky, etc. I find this extremely unprofessional. Ellis comes across to me as a shock-jock dumb-downer and popularizer, an attention-seeker.

The first edition of this book was published in 1964. It was, as one reviewer has asserted, written with the extensive scholarly aid of Joseph Wallfield ("Warren Johansson"). John Zimmer Eglinton was in reality the numismatist Walter Breen, a rather eccentric figure married to a science-fiction writer. He claimed to "know" Italian as a result of being the reincarnation of an Italian of the Renaissance. He had a falling-out with Wallfield when they embarked on a revised edition. Wallfield was in favor of a lowering of the age of consent to 14, but refused to assist Breen any more when it became evident that Breen was interested in boys younger than 14. As to the supposed horribleness of encouraging boys to grow up heterosexual, as the other reviewer claims, I fail to see how Breen could have won over anyone to his cause if he had said that the point of pederasty is to encourage the boy to grow up gay. "They cannot reproduce, therefore they must recruit!" (Anita Bryant) Breen's point was to assure parents that pederasty is not the same thing as recruitment. After being abandoned by Wallfield, Breen attempted to enlist the scholarly aid of another researcher, but Breen was so hopelessly disorganized that the new man threw up his hands, and the revised version never appeared. The blatant discrepancy between the idealistic arguments of the book and the real-life behavior of Walter Breen, if the accusations were true, is typical of the way in which special pleading often lapses into hypocrisy. I might add that Breen made the inexplicable blunder of saying that Gide was not a pederast.

I read this in Portuguese (Devassos no Paraiso). One could perhaps wish for more history and less activism. Believe it or not, the history of homosexuality actually does not consist of talking about little activist groups and their publications. The illustrations will probably give "nice" homosexuals a fit, since they tend towards the lurid.

Geoff Puterbaugh many years ago wrote a lengthy review of Karlen's book for a scholarly gay publication. Unfortunately it is not available on the internet. Suffice it to say that anyone suffering from the delusion that Karlen was even slightly sympathetic to gay people should read Puterbaugh's scathing review if he can find it. Example: In the chapter where Karlen is dealing with the question of whether gay people are crazy, he selects Albert Ellis to deliver the final verdict, which is that gay people are "pretty nutty." This doesn't sound very gay-friendly to me. I understand that there are many people out there whose distaste for homosexuality falls short of a call to have gay people lynched on sight, but although this may not be "hatred" in the KKK sense, it is still hostility of a sort, and it is simply not acceptable any longer. I will take a giant leap and say that I do not consider homosexuality to be genetic, but neither do I intend to convert to being interested in people (i.e., women) in whom I am not interested. I am not one of those gay men who call for all and sundry to bow down before dogmatic opinions uttered by the stalwarts of the soi-disant "gay agenda" of which we have been warned by assorted Jeremiahs, but neither do I take advice from reactionaries like Karlen or Ellis.

This book is not written by a human being, it is written by a politician running for office, afraid of offending swing voters by actually standing for something definite (other than being elected). One gets the impression that Chairman BHO learned all his lessons in flipfloppery, feel-good piffle and general all-around wishy-washiness by sitting at the feet of Mitt Romney. That God (or the next best thing, whichever comes first) should have learned all his tricks from the Devil should come as no surprise. There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Dems and the Reps, and if you think there is, the more fool you.

The key to the mysteries surrounding this novel are to be found in a long and excellent article available on the internet, by Will H. L.

Walter Starkie, the translator of these tales, was an Irish expert on Spain and lived there for many years. He attempted to rescue these "novelas exemplares" from the oblivion into which they have been cast as a result of being overshadowed by "Don Quixote" but apparently to no avail. Nevertheless, they are worth reading.

It is impossible to please everyone without making this book twice as long. I was a bit irritated at the inclusion of some people who are famous only for being gay. The absence of Winston Leyland of Gay Sunshine Press was quite a comment on how what goes around comes around. I was pleased at the inclusion of Michael Davidson and Sandro Penna, annoyed at the exclusion of Tony Duvert and Jens Eisenhardt. One could go on and on.

Much of this book is devoted to the historical background, and much is devoted to analyses of the paintings. The illustrations could have been better. The reader is presented with a general view of Italy circa 1600. The author sides with those who seek to minimize or deny the painter's homosexuality. This book is useful for learning the facts of the artist's life and times. I'm not sure that the author manages to get inside the painter's head and heart.

Bawer reminds me of Gloria Upson, a character in Auntie Mame: stuffy, snobbish, uptight, obtuse, laughable. I will admit that I never did manage to relate to the gay subculture idea of what "we" were. I cringed at GAA meetings when someone read aloud a screed beginning "When we were young and it was raining, we stayed inside and played with our dolls ..." I felt like screaming "I didn't have any dolls!" And I see no point to Gay Pride parades. But even if I can meet Bawer halfway on some points, this book still ruffles my feathers. One gets the impression that if Bawer were straight, he would have been homophobic. At one meeting when he was touting his book, some drag queen said that what he was getting at is that America should accept, not all gays, but only the "nice" ones, such as his glorious self (glorious as in Gloria). The famous scene where Bawer and his hubby attend the marriage of a straight friend and get insulted is a clue-in to what is wrong here. What gave Bawer the idea that the photographer would take a picture of Bawer-and-hubby as one of the "married couples" there? Didn't he understand that he was in enemy territory? What was he doing hanging out with such people? The central message of this book is that the gay community would be accepted if it would only purge all of the pervs in order to humor the Normal Ones.

Just two little comments. First, many early Spanish explorers claimed to have found tribes that spoke Hebrew. Second, Arthur Koestler in his book The Thirteenth Tribe has proven that the modern Jews are mostly descended, not from the Israelites, but from the Khazars, a Tartar tribe in southern Russia that underwent wholesale conversion to the Jewish religion, and then migrated into Lithuania, Poland, Germany, etc., thus becoming the Jews of today. So if the American Indians are not Israelites, the modern Jews themselves are also not Israelites. If you compare Indian DNA to modern Jewish DNA, you are not comparing Indians to Israelites, you are comparing Indians to Khazars.

This is probably one of the ten finest fantasy novels of the 20th century. The author was a genius. The first half is very funny, then it turns into a murder mystery. The style is wonderful. The fairy fruit does not refer to drugs, it refers to the Dionysian element in life. I loved the names of the characters.

Bruccoli specialized in exactly the sort of writers who are the ones least likely to attract me as a reader. I will admit that I have never read anything by Cozzens, and am not likely to ever read him. But a well-researched and well-written biography is what it is, regardless of whether the subject is or is not my cup of tea. I only read this because of Cozzens' connection with Cuthbert Wright, who is just barely mentioned. I read the whole biography anyway. It is overwhelming in its completeness of detail. We are told everything except how Cozzens had his eggs (scrambled, hard-boiled, etc.). Of course I was not surprised that Cozzens was a drunk (so was Cuthbert Wright). Only someone resolutely interested in Cozzens will wish to read all of this. I did find it fascinating that Cozzens in his youth was the protege of no less than three poets that I am currently researching, namely Cuthbert Wright, Robert Hillyer and Lucius Beebe. One need only look at the photos of the young Cozzens to understand the why and wherefore of these mentor/protege relationships. My own dealings with Kent School in researching Wright have made me appreciate what Bruccoli went through in researching that period of Cozzens' life.

Too many gay teenagers have been thrown out of the house just for being what they are. But to keep them at home and rant at them would also be miserable. Barry Goldwater (Mister Conservative) changed his mind about homosexuality because his grandson was gay. Many of his fans felt that he had betrayed their ideals by loving his grandson! If you have to choose between your child and your God, maybe you have the wrong God.

The first part of the book is devoted to historical and cross-cultural descriptions around the world (but not in Latin America). The second part is devoted to modern America (USA).

John Taylor, the president of the LDS church during the federal crackdown on polygamy, led a rather exciting life. During the martyrdom of Joseph and Hiram at Carthage Jail, Taylor was hit by seven bullets and yet survived. During his presidency, he fled into hiding as the feds invaded Utah -- one of those episodes in American history that they always "forget" to mention. Here we have his teachings as part of a general series. His teachings on plural marriage are left out, no doubt as part of the rewriting of Mormon history as a sop to the enemies of the church. If the current leadership would just stop caring what the neighbors think, Taylor might be seen in a more accurate light.

Gavin Arthur was the gay grandson of President Chester A. Arthur. As you can tell from this book, Gavin was rather eccentric. My favorite bit from this book was the part where he explains that traditional Jewish circumcision involved an act which resembles gay sex. As strange as this sounds, and even if you never heard this before and assume that Gavin was crazy, the fact of the matter is that what he said was true. This has all sorts of interesting implications, especially if you think of Paul and Timothy in the Bible.

John Cowper Powys extravagantly praised this novel, but that didn't stop it from sinking without a trace. McIntosh was born in Oregon in 1908. He spent a lot of time at sea and in other working-class trades, although his father was a college professor. He claimed to have spent time in the jungles of Southeast Asia, and to have walked across Siberia on foot, presumably with permission of the communists, which seems rather unlikely. At any rate, he came to New York in 1933, married, and worked on his novel. He made three drafts of it, but all were rejected, possibly because homosexuality was not accepted in those days. He finally killed himself in 1940. Powys arranged for the novel to be published, but there are two different publishers in the same year (1941) who issued it, one of these editions possibly being pirated. The dust jacket said that McIntosh was not homosexual, but that he sympathized with outcasts.

I read the entire King James Version some 30 years ago. I was an atheist when I read it. I later became an agnostic. On the one hand, it is a literary masterpiece that simply cannot be ignored. On the other hand, it is a load of rubbish that has had an immensely toxic effect on the human race. It presents us with a megalomaniacal and genocidal deity who wants every man, woman and child to grovel and hand over their money. Was there ever a deity who wasn't in favor of organized religion, or who wasn't short of cash? It is admittedly hard to review this book without turning a book review into an opinion piece about the Jewish and Christian religions. I do not apologize for doing so. It would take forever to list all of my opinions about the various passages that need commenting on. Let me just try one itsy-bitsy example. Matthew 16:28 has Jesus speaking to a crowd circa 33 AD. He informs them that some of them will still be alive at the time of the Second Coming. It has now been twenty centuries since this promise was made. This passage doesn't contain the word "soon" so you can't wriggle out of it by using the standard soon-doesn't-really-mean-soon argument so dear to Christians who are painfully aware that the New Testament was obviously written by people who were convinced that the Second Coming would happen in a few years, probably within their lifetimes.

It is unfortunate that this unique collection of photos and drawings of Oscar Wilde is so small, thus causing many of the illustrations to be almost absurdly small. It is impossible, especially in looking at the Sarony photos, to avoid the impression of Oscar as being self-absorbed and essentially marketing himself as a "product." Rather than being a coffee-table book, this is a tea-tray book.

One is at first overwhelmed by Boswell's breathtaking scholarship and gift for languages. But when one has somewhat recovered, one finds all sorts of things wrong with this misguided book. The theory that the Catholic church didn't turn homophobic until Aquinas is of course nonsense. The theory that the Bible doesn't really condemn homosexuality is of couse nonsense. The idea of "gay people" in the Middle Ages is of course nonsense. The idea that pederasty among the Greeks never involved boys younger that the modern age of consent is of course nonsense. The idea of an impudent academic telling the Pope how to run the Church is of course nonsense. The idea that you can lobby God to change His attitude is of course nonsense. And the idea that chastity need not be practiced in the era of AIDS is of course nonsense. Boswell fell into his own trap and died prematurely because he essentially had no clue as to what humility means with regard to trying to outsmart the Pope and God, as if Boswell was not bound by the rules that others must obey. (I am not a Catholic, by the way.)

Reparative therapy has been outlawed in Ecuador. That's right, people like the author can be, and should be, arrested if they go to Ecuador and try practicing this voodoo. These therapists all seem alike. They all think that being gay has something to do with effeminacy, they all think that homosexuality is a disorder or disease or problem or whatever, they all think that you should switch to heterosexuality because organized religion says so, they all think that psychoanalytic psychotherapeutic psychotherapy has all the answers, the answers always having something to do with your parents or your failure to play football or whatever, and all of these voodoo priests are Republicans who get their news from Fox or World Net Daily. I dare you to find even one reparative therapist who is a Democrat. Why is it that a man can't be a "real" man unless he prefers football to Shakespeare?

News websites have been recently featuring photos of a vandalized, ruined church in Detroit. I was just at the point in this book where Shand-Tucci is talking about Cram's architectural efforts in Detroit when I saw the news photos. I just know that this is one of Cram's churches! I was rather overwhelmed by the size and weight of this book, and perhaps one could wish that the author had been a bit more concise here and there, especially when there is really no need to give the full names of people who have already been mentioned over and over a hundred times. But one can forgive Shand-Tucci in exchange for this excellent study of the Bohemian world of staid Boston. I am not much of a fan of Gothic architecture, preferring Baroque and Rococo, so I tended to nod off when reading some of the details, but I admire the drawings of the churches. One is painfully reminded of the stark contrast between America as it was and as it is now.

Yes, I have actually read this book. It is the usual Bible-thumpery with the inevitable Christian fixation on the sexual sins, especially every right-winger's favorite sin, homosexuality. Gee, I always thought that the Bible said that ALL have come short of the glory of God, "Not one of you is perfect", "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone", etc. Nowadays, there are even some major sins such as gluttony which don't get denounced at all. Gluttony was listed as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. When was the last time you heard a sermon against gluttony? When was the last time you heard of a church organist being fired for gluttony? And if San Francisco is so wicked, why hasn't God sent the fire and brimstone yet? Why complain about cities that are full of sinners, when ALL men are sinners, and therefore ALL cities are full of sinners? Are you one of the righteous who is smug about Joplin being destroyed by a tornado because of the sinfulness of the Joplinites?

If any intelligent person were to ask me to recommend two novels written in my lifetime (1943 on to now), I would without hesitation suggest Orwell's 1984 and this book by Raspail. Orwell was right. Raspail was right. If you don't believe Raspail, come to Miami, where I live. The number of Latin American and West Indian immigrants living in Miami in 1943 was less than 1 per cent. Today the number is 90 per cent. I was lucky to have chosen Spanish to study when I was 12, because that is now the dominant language here. The whole city has been turned into one vast slum in which not one word of English is spoken. This is not a rant, it is a simple statement of facts. Yes, I know, only a "racist" would mention such facts even if they are true. And that is ultimately Raspail's point, that everyone who objects to a relatively sudden tidal wave of immigrants is silenced by the accusation of "racism." I have lived this novel, I have seen it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears.

This is Shiel's second most famous novel after The Purple Cloud, and it is a masterpiece, but the Jewish theme which is central to it has forever spoiled the possibility of it being judged purely as a work of literature. Discussion about it invariably degenerates into dealing with it merely as an anti-Semitic tract. If one could only go back to the attitude of Hugh Walpole and Carl Van Vechten in the 1920s and see it as a classic of science-fiction, very well-written, and ignore the anti-Semitism, one would have an objective discussion. Let it be noted, after all, that the Jews in the novel end up in Israel and not in gas chambers.

A leftist do-gooder organization called Gherush92 Committee for Human Rights has denounced Dante's masterpiece as racist, homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, and demanded that the book be removed from all Italian schools so as not to poison the minds of the students. This is what comes of trying to apply 21st century concepts to a work written 700 years earlier in a society whose values were completely different. The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.

This well-written account of the abortive coup of 1923 is not listed among the sources for the wikipedia article, perhaps because of the lack of footnotes. Although it is to be expected, it is still somewhat annoying to see on almost every page a study drum-beat of belittling adjectives such as shabby, shoddy, turgid, etc., when speaking of Hitler and his followers, whether one is talking about their clothing, their literary style, or whatever. Here we are dealing with a man who deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with Attila, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, and all we get from the author is a petty throwing of verbal spitballs at him.

In their day, Ford and Beach were considered as subversive as Margaret Mead and Alfred Kinsey, all of them being liberals with regard to sex, and backing up their opinions with research that put traditional sexual morality in America in a bad light by comparing it with statistics that proved, or seemed to prove, that things like homosexuality were far more widespread than suspected, and that "primitive" tribes were more indulgent than conservative Americans were. This book was considered a major bombshell in its day, and its findings were used for a long time to argue against American sexual morality. I recently noticed that one of its source books, 'Living With Lepchas' by John Morris, was written by a gay man, even though the Lepchas (of Sikkim) did not approve of homosexuality, which suggests that the Ford and Beach book was not as prone to give the evidence a liberal bias as one might suppose, for surely Morris would have had a motive for saying the opposite of what he said if the intent was to give people the impression that homosexuality was "normal and natural."

I think that the whole issue here can be summarized in 1st Corinthians 6:19-20, where Paul tells us that we must not fornicate because we are not our own, we are bought with a price. I am reminded of a statement made years ago by a woman at my church. Her teenage son had dyed his hair orange. She got angry and said, "It's not your body." I felt that this was one of the stupidest statements I had ever heard. How could his body not be his body? But she was theologically correct. Paul would be the first to agree. This is the whole problem in a nutshell. The Christian churches teach that God owns you, partly because he created you, partly because Christ bought you with his blood. This is where homosexuality comes in. Because the churches claim to represent God on Earth, and God owns you, therefore the churches own you. Therefore the churches have the right and the duty to treat you and your sex drive as church property, to be disposed of as the church sees fit. It's not your body. Your body is the property of the pastor, the prophet, the priest, etc. All of the money in your bank account also belongs to them. It's not your money. It's not your brain. It's not your hand or foot or neck or anything. You are owned by somebody else. This is why the churches have the right and duty to push you into marriages with persons of the gender to which you are not attracted. These are called arranged marriages. And if you are spineless enough to put up with all this nonsense, you deserve what you get.

I read the first edition of this fascinating book in 1967 when I was living in Morocco. Although I had the exotic right at my doorstep, I went ahead and transported myself from Barbary to the Gobi and dwelt there in my imagination for awhile. This is a great book and hard to beat. But it must be understood that I did not read it to learn something, I read it to immerse myself in another form of the exotic, other than the one at my doorstep. It is rather hard to explain the psychology of this, but I just couldn't get enough.

This is a sentimental novelette about two boys, one of whom has a crush on the other. One of them dies. This book was dedicated to, and horrified, Henry James. It is rather similar to the novel "Tim" by Howard Overing Sturgis. This quaint and charming tale reeks of the age in which it was written (1905). The death at the end happens simply because sentimentalists expected such deaths. This has little to do with the slightly later tradition of killing off everybody at the end of novels about homosexuality.

H. von Kleist is one of my favorite writers. He had "problems" and they shine darkly through all these magnificent stories, surely among the most brilliant ever written. Here is a world without mercy or pity. The novella 'Michael Kohlhaas' is particularly breathtaking. But the reader has to be intelligent. This is not for everyone.

At least Rowse was a professional historian rather than an enthusiastic amateur who mindlessly collects great names to prove an unprovable point. But he was the product of a certain time and place, a certain social class, a certain mentality. In short, he was an educated Englishman, with all that this implies. This book is very snobbish, very ethnocentric. This is a book in which the world consists of England and a few other places thrown in for good measure just to show he's a good sport. This is one of those books in which Latin America, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Africa, eastern Europe minus Russia, Polynesia, Portugal, etc. simply don't exist; or, if they do exist, they shouldn't. Neither do the lower classes exist, nor certain races unworthy of mention in polite society. He says that Shakespeare had no sexual interest in Mr W. H. of the Sonnets. Far be it from Rowse to conceive of gay history as a social history involving ordinary men. There are no footnotes, a fatal mistake.

Nobody can deny that there are a lot of obnoxious people in the world. This, however, does not mean that you ought to lump them all together and give them a psychiatric label. Taking a bunch of random anecdotes about obnoxious behavior and then claiming that all of these creeps have a syndrome is perhaps to create a sort of illusion. The idea that obnoxious behavior is a discrete clinical entity is open to question. If it is a sickness for a serial killer to fail to empathize with his victims, then why is it not a sickness for military men to fail to empathize when they drop bombs on civilians? We do not take the crew that bombed Hiroshima and call them psychopaths.

First, I never had any gender disorder, I was never effeminate and have never engaged in "the female role" in sex. I never played with dolls, and so forth. I have always identified as a male, yet all of my sexual partners have been male. So much for the theory that becoming gay has something to do with identifying with the other gender. I was violently in love with two girls when I was 14 and 15. Later on, from time to time I used Playboy centerfolds for the usual purpose well into my 20s. This doesn't seem to fit the scenario of this book at all. I think that people should accept their homosexual feelings and not fight them. I do not necessarily endorse the gay gene theory, I think that this is a bit silly. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that this book is one inch away from, for example, a book written by a functionary of the Spanish Inquisition titled "A Catholic Parent's Guide to Preventing Protestantism." The infamous tactics used by these psychoanalysts includes methods that in any other context would be defined as torture. The fact that the deluded patients consent to be tortured in no way mitigates the fact that it is indeed torture. I once met one of these pathetic creatures, a man who picked me up and then sat away from me on the bus as if he didn't know me, then finally freaked out and fled into the night before arriving at my place. I cannot even imagine acting like that. Get over it! And as for you parents out there, if you don't like it, at least don't subject your offspring to torture. And as for you psychotherapists who are making money this way, you are disgusting to the max!

This book was published around the time when Americans were just getting used to the idea of the legal age of adulthood being lowered from 21 to 18. It seems that there has been a reaction even to this mildest and most reasonable of reforms. There is more and more talk of human beings not reaching 'full' mental growth until age 24. It is against the law in various places to rent hotel rooms to under-21's. In Miami Beach it is against the law for orange juice to be served to under-21's (no, not a joke). It is of course against the law to serve alcohol to under-21's, even if they are in the military. The pediatric establishment defines "child" as anyone under 21, so that 20-year-olds can stay in pediatric hospitals. All newspapers report teenage criminal behavior with the word "teen" always included in the headline in a way that the word "Jew" (for example) would never be used. Connecticut repealed its law which had permitted 16-year-olds to live away from home without permission. Every parent has the right to emancipate their teenager, and yet very few do so. I will admit that Holt seems to be going too far in such chapters as the one to legalize drugs for teenagers, and the age of consent has been moving higher instead of lower in the midst of moral panics. Holt's use of royal princes from the past is hardly a proof of freedom for teenagers in general in the past. In fact, the age of adulthood in France used to be 35, then it was lowered to 30, then to 25, then to 18 (no, I'm not making this up). History proves exactly the opposite of what Holt sought to prove. Even now, the age of adulthood in Alaska and Alabama is still 19 rather than 18. Mankind is moving backwards on this issue. I need hardly mention the loss of civil rights for high school students. It just gets worse and worse. Even today, Holt would be considered a radical extremist.

All of the Mormon scriptures are written in an old-fashioned style that obviously derives from the King James Version. I can see where Joseph Smith used this style in the Book of Mormon and the Pearl of Great Price, as these are presented as translations. However, the D&C is supposed to be the very words of Christ speaking to Joseph Smith in the 1830s. Why would Christ speak to an American in the 1830s in a deliberate imitation of the style of a translation, instead of in modern English? It seems to me that this needs explaining.

One would think from this sort of awful offal that men are not a gender but a conspiracy. Is it really necessary to explain why people with wombs might think that these wombs serve some purpose other than providing abortionists with something to abort? She talks about Republican women. Hey, why not explain why Natalie Clifford Barney supported Mussolini, or why Eva Braun married Hitler, or why Ingrid Rimland married Ernst Zundel (the holocaust denier)? How about Nesta Webster? The list is a long one. Didn't Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan have wives? Talk about right-wing women! But I think that what Dworkin is really getting at is that any woman who isn't a pinko radical is a traitor to her gender.

The vast majority of the poets examined here were of no literary interest whatever. This should put to rest the superstition about homosexuals being talented. It is to the student of the literary expression of homosexual feelings, and not to the student of literature per se, that this book will be of interest. The writings examined here are mostly rare, expensive, unobtainable. D'Arch Smith does us an enormous favor by bringing all of these obscure twitterings to our attention. The appendix on Stuart-Young and Chubb brings the book to a fascinating conclusion. Lest you think that I am being unduly negative, d'Arch Smith himself was under no illusions about the literary quality of the poets in question.

This excellent overview of the origins of Greek pederasty carefully and thoughtfully sifts through the evidence, neither pushing an agenda nor knuckling under to hysteria, which is saying a lot in this society. Here we have a world in which the boys are not seen as "traumatized victims" and the men are not seen as "grooming predators" of the Sandusky type. It is interesting to note that there is not one shred of evidence that the Greeks were ever interested in boys younger than twelve, even though there seems to have been no age of consent laws as we know them.

I own the 1917 edition of this relatively brief book. The term "intermediate types" is a long-since discarded term meaning homosexual, but Carpenter was not shy about using the term "homosexual" itself. The book is divided into two parts, corresponding to what later became known as "butch" amd "femme" types of gay men. The first part is an anthropological study of femmes in tribal societies (Siberia, Native Americans, etc.) who perform religious roles such as shaman or witch-doctor. The second part is devoted to the butch warriors of ancient Greece and the Japanese samurai. This book is a gold-mine of information.

The author should be considered a major philosopher, but due to the failure of his prediction of a social cataclysm prior to 2000, he remains a prophet without honor. He was born in Jamaica around 1952, raised in England, moved to America. His chief philosophic work, 'The Resurrection of Aristocracy' briefly brought him to public attention in 1988, but his value system and theories about civilization were so hopelessly at odds with the dominant values of our culture that the establishment completely ignored him. His scathing denunciation of modern society is well worth quoting even today, as things have only gotten worse.

Ignatiev claims that he doesn't hate White people or want to exterminate them. As a gay man myself, I can see an uncanny similarity to his attitude towards White people and a reparative therapist's attitude towards gay people. A reparative therapist will say that he doesn't hate gay people, he just has compassion for them and wants to help them to become heterosexual. In exactly the same way, Ignatiev doesn't hate White people, he has compassion for them and wants to help them leave their "whiteness." In effect, what he and his ilk are promoting is a sort of reparative therapy for White people, based on the idea that "whiteness" is a disorder that needs to be cured.

I nagged my father into buying this book for me when I was in high school over fifty years ago, and I was glad to obtain it as I have always been a history fan. I had previously known little or nothing about Russian history, and I learned a great deal in a painless fashion. The text is superficial and the focus is on the pictures. The earlier historical periods are illustrated by paintings by Surikov and others, while the later periods are illustrated by photographs. Everything is in black and white.

All theories with regard to the "cause" of homosexuality are incorrect. It doesn't have a "cause" of any sort. All of you suffering people out there, you reviewers who moan and groan, get over it! I am a 68-year-old gay man who has not had a problem with my homosexuality since the 1960s, when it dawned on me that Christianity and psychotherapy are both rubbish. What the heck are you talking about? What problem? Don't you know that the divorce rate stands at 50% and the illegitimacy rate stands at 40%? Why are you so eager to rush to board a sinking ship? Heterosexuality is the Titanic, it is sinking and you want to be a passenger on it! I was never involved in my life with unsafe sexual practices, I was never in danger of AIDS. You can be gay without risk, it is really very simple. There are a few simple, common-sense rules, that is all. Stop giving your money to the priest and the therapist. Spend it on yourself. Stop being a confused, self-loathing idiot. There is nothing wrong with you. If it worked for me, it could work for you. Stop trying to run away from yourself.

Just take any anti-Semitic book and replace the word "Jew" with the word "homosexual" and voila! You have this book, or any book similar to it. The anti-Semites tell you that the Jews in America are a tiny minority, and yet they control Hollywood, the media, television, Broadway, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street, etc. etc. In exactly the same way, the homophobes tell you that homosexuals are a tiny minority, and yet they control Hollywood, the media, television, Broadway, the fashion industry, ballet, etc. etc. The international Zionist agenda becomes the homosexual agenda. They're out to get you, they're everywhere! They want to do horrible things like join the Army, or get married! Oh, ain't it awwwwwful! I love the way that the term "religious freedom" is being used here to refer to the "freedom" to prevent gay people from having the rights their taxpayer dollars have paid for. Yes, that's right, gay people actually pay taxes! They pay the same amount that the Christians pay. But the Christians don't want gay tax money to result in the gay taxpayers getting anything in return for their tax dollars. The Christians want the gay taxpayers to have taxation without benefits. There was a gay man and a Christian who both went into a sandwich shop and they both paid five bucks for a sandwich. The owner took the money from both of them and gave a sandwich to the Christian, but gave nothing to the gay man. The gay man demanded a sandwich in exchange for the money he had paid out, but the owner said, "You are not equal, and therefore you get nothing, but I'm keeping your money." This is the sort of treatment to which the Christians wish to subject the homosexuals, and if the latter complain, they are accused of having an agenda.

I do not feel guilty about being white. I have never lynched anyone. The clear message of this poisonous book is that white people as such are devils, and black people as such are victims, if not angels. If you are wondering about white flight from the Democratic party, it is because the Democratic party is controlled by people who think like Carr.

Wagenknecht loomed large in my mind some fifty years ago, mostly because of this book, which to me was a sort of literary bible. It was the standard reference work on the subject of British fiction from a conservative, genteel viewpoint, one that differed remarkably from that of all those cocktail-party communists who ruled the literary roost in those days. It is true that EW tipped his hat to prevailing trends by including a chapter on Joyce, but he more than balanced this by including, probably to everyone's amusement, a whole chapter on the fiction of Walter de la Mare, of all people. He also mentioned Eric Eddison, not exactly everyone's cup of tea. He put in a good word for Elizabeth Goudge. He was way out of step with the times and the fashions, and it was this that endeared him to me. He should have called it Cavalcade of the British Novel, seeing that such writers as Scott and Joyce were not English. He lived to be more than 100 years old and thus had the last laugh on who knows how many trendy types who sneered at him.

I lived in Morocco during 1966-67, right after this book was published. Eleanor Hoffmann was the author of "Mischief in Fez" and a number of horse books for young people. She was born in 1895, I don't have her death date. She dealt with the history of Morocco in a very interesting manner, and it was of great use to me when travelling around seeing the historical sites. Her surname was Hoffmann, not Hoffman, and the publication date is 1965, not 1956.

This is one of a series of strident and hysterical books by Reisman in which she continues to make a career out of Kinsey-bashing. Her opinions are tailored to meet the wishful thinking of a readership of very conservative Christians. She could just as easily have written books attacking Darwin or any of the other Usual Suspects. She chose Kinsey as the figure to demonize. She presents him and his associates as devils, and she does everything short of trying to prove that they were Satanists. One is reminded of the old books about witchcraft in which the witches are presented as guilty of every possible abomination.

The text is not very long but it is informative. This is about a world-famous German photographer of male nudes who settled in Taormina, Sicily, in the late 19th century. The local males were perfectly content to pose, often with rather silly props, for "artistic" nude photos which gradually became popular around Europe, not merely among homosexuals, but among people in general. Most of this book is of course devoted to the photos. They are erotic but not pornographic. They are in good taste. I personally don't consider von Gloeden (pronounced glerden) to have been a great artistic photographer, but he was of great cultural significance in his day.

There is some material on Tesch in the archives of Jones and the colony, but Tesch remains something of a mystery. The paperback edition is an abridged version of the hardcover text. It was praised by J. Z. Eglinton in 1964. Copies of either edition are rare.

I discovered this book at a small suburban library when I was about 14 years old and was entranced by Powell's fascinating description of a trip he made in the 1920s with his wife and daughter to French North Africa. Towards the end of the book there was a photo of a Berber walled city in the Atlas mountains which enflamed my youthful imagination to the boiling point, only to despair of not having a magic carpet that could fly me to this exotic land at once. The years passed. At the age of 22, I went off to Morocco, not just to visit, but to live there for more than a year! I bought an old copy of this book before setting out on the Great Adventure, and took it with me. I stayed at the same hotel in Fes where Powell stayed. At age 23, towards the end of my residence there, I desperately took off for Marrakesh and from there at dawn took a bus up up up into the mountains and down the other side, where I discovered a Berber walled city much like the one in the book. I visited it. I then went to the so-called bus station and showed the photo in the book to the ticket man, but although he knew where it was, he told me "You can't get there from here." But I had just visited a walled city as good as the one in the book, so I considered my dream to have come true.

One would think from this tirade that all pornography is heterosexual. But of course there exists a lot of male homosexual pornography. This would never involve possessing or abusing women, since there are no women in homosexual pornography. I suspect that all of these feminist arguments against pornography are really based on traditional Judaeo-Christian puritanism and prudery. There is also the little matter of the demonization of males, of masculinity, and of heterosexuality.

Nobody seems to be aware that Tripp's eagerness to add Lincoln to the list of Famous Homosexuals is yet another case of wishful thinking based on political considerations. After all, Lincoln is universally considered to be a hero. It may come as news to a lot of you, but Lincoln has traditionally been considered by white Southerners to have been the villain of the Civil War, the man who caused 600,000 young men to lose their lives, caused the destruction of Atlanta and Richmond, and set the South back for decades. If viewed from this standpoint, Tripp might have hesitated to lay the blame for all this on a homosexual. If it is true that Lincoln had some close male friendships, it is equally true that Stonewall Jackson likewise had such friendships. If presented with the evidence on Jackson, Tripp would have refused to write a book on him, for what result would he have gained by connecting homosexuality with a defender of slavery? Tripp wanted Lincoln to be gay, and then worked backward to prove a premise. Alexander Pope once wrote that "all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye" and this is surely an example of that. As to Lincoln's marriage, there have always been lots of rocky marriages that had nothing to do with homosexuality. It would appear that the only proven homosexual presidents were James Buchanan and Chester Arthur. Noel Garde said that Washington was gay, and Angelo d'Arcangelo said that Herbert Hoover was gay, but nobody else seems to have agreed.

If I understand this weird little book correctly -- and I fear that I do -- Fernbach is telling us that the only way to "save" the human race is to transform the human body through evolution, no doubt with the aid of mad scientists, into a genderless something-or-other that would, among other things, do away with sexual orientation, and thus ironically do away with homosexuality. But perhaps this is what he had in mind. The only way to save the village is to destroy it.

Gosse's motto apparently was "Don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up." Although he was a scientist and therefore should have known better, he was also a member of a small, fanatical millenarian cult with a literal belief in Genesis, which posits that the world was created in a flash in 4004 BC. Since all of the scientific data pointed in the other direction, with the strong implication that Genesis is simply a Jewish creation myth which has no more validity than a Navaho creation myth, for example, Gosse tried to hold on to his cult beliefs by dreaming up a totally preposterous rationalization in which God is seen as a hoaxster and the universe as a hoax. This obviously doesn't put God in a good light, and many Christians have rejected Gosse along with the usual atheists. One unusual result of Gosse's theory was a theory called Last Thursdayism, which posits that everything was created last Thursday, but God made it look older.

As a member of the NRA and a subscriber to American Rifleman, I am very familiar with Mr LaPierre and his opinions, and of course I agree with them. Every time there is a highly-publicized gun crime, such as school shootings, the NRA once again has to trot out the "guns don't kill people, people kill people" mantra. It really shouldn't be necessary to say this. England put a stop to gun crime by putting a stop to guns, but the only result was that gun crime was replaced by knife crime. If criminals don't have one weapon, they will find another weapon. If we had an epidemic of strangulations, would the government outlaw hands? While living in New Orleans in 1971, I was attacked by four punks who threw bricks at me. Should bricks be outlawed? When Cain killed Abel, did he use a gun? It sometimes seems that the government is on the side of the criminal when it wants to prevent people from protecting themselves with guns.

This is a modest collection of Uranian poetry written by three poets who were discussed by Timothy d'Arch Smith in "Love in Earnest" (1970). He made the mistake of thinking that Wright was British, when in fact he was American. This mistake seems to account for his being included here.

I am an elderly gay man who has read the entire KJV Bible, and I can assure you that it does indeed condemn, in no uncertain terms, all same-sex behavior. This is one of a number of silly books that attempt to pretend that these passages have somehow been misunderstood.

Written in 1927 and not in 1692 as has so often been supposed, this brief inspirational work has been very widely quoted in a world where things don't always go right. My life has also seen its ups and downs, but I have gotten a lift from Henley's Invictus rather than from stuff like Desiderata. Much, perhaps everything in it is true to some degree. However, it vaguely irks me with its pompous style and its smug platitudes. It should hardly be necessary to say these things, they are so self-evident. I am particularly irked by the most famous passage, "You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here." How easy it is to parody this with, for example, "no less than the tiger who is about to have you for lunch." I am tempted to respond to this passage with a simple "So what?" It sounds nice, but if you actually can't feel good unless you are told that you have a right to exist, just as the trees and stars (and the tiger) have a right to exist, then you must really be having it rough. You need more help than this work can give you.

This French overview of homosexuality dates from 1964, and is therefore sadly out of date, but the text is inclusive and adequate. There are a lot of pictures, many of them frankly erotic. There are a lot of pictures of lesbians, apparently intended to encourage heterosexual men to buy the book.

The recipient of these letters was introduced to homosexuality by a pedophile at age 11, and this relationship continued well into his teens. He then graduated into regular homosexuality, if only because he didn't know any better. Compare this with the Steven Stayner trajectory: kidnapped at age 7, had sex every night with his kidnapper for 7 years, then left, went back home, married, became a father, and died in a traffic accident. Seven years of this stuff didn't turn Stayner into a homosexual, but it turned Mike into one. Interesting. In any case, I am a 68-year-old gay man who was a virgin until the age of 25. Nothing happened to me to turn me into something I wasn't. I remember a incident when I was 9, where I was rebuffed by another boy when I embraced him while we were both shirtless. At that time I also knew a weird boy of 9 called Paul. He had already developed the body language and mannerisms of an effeminate homosexual. I'm sure that no pedophile had done this to him, for he was remarkably ugly. I am willing to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he was headed for heterosexuality until the pedophile came along. But pedophilia is not the cause of homosexuality. Maybe a failure of his father to relate to him may have pushed him into the pedophile's arms, but Stayner didn't turn gay even after 3,000 nights with Kenneth Parnell. So my guess is that Mike wasn't really gay, and therefore he simply returned to his original heterosexuality after a 12-year detour. This is not the same thing as transforming a homosexual into a heterosexual. It doesn't prove anything about other men.

It came as a bit of a shock when I ended this book to turn in search of some information about the author, only to find that Costello died in 1995 under mysterious circumstances after devoting much effort to writing books like this one, which must have made him a lot of enemies. He does tend to stray at times from the main theme, and he errs in supposing that Blunt was the Cambridge mastermind, but generally this is a fascinating page-turner. Truth is stranger than fiction. It is horrifying to see how the Soviets ran rings around British counterintelligence. Some readers may get the impression that homosexuality has something to do with treason, so it is wise to remember that most spies and traitors are heterosexual.

I got this when it first came out. It was a charming anthology from around the world, with nice illustrations. The only problem for me was that it consists entirely of heterosexual love poetry, and since I am gay, there was only a sort of generic pleasure which I could feel for the love expressed. Of course, heterosexuals would consider it absurd for the title to have been The World's Heterosexual Love Poetry.

I read this when it first came out, when I was 17 or 18 years old, some fifty years ago. None of this is great literature, but it is an amusing read and gives the modern reader an insight into daily life in England in the 17th century.
