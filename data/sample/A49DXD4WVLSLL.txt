This book employes many of the themes one would expect from a pulp adventure story, particularly one written in the 1930's: exotic locations, treachous villains, wicked cults, bizarre civilizations and two mysteriously seductive heroines - one a Madonna-type the other a witch queen. The hero, Lief Langdon, is handsome, athletic, intelligent and fully versed in survival skills. Regrettable he has a split personality; sometimes he is the reincarnation of the ancient cult leader Dwayanu and sometimes the fearless soldier of fortune Lief. Complicating matters is that Dwayanu has the unfortunate ability to conjure from another dimension a kraken-like being called Khalk're that has a taste for human sacrifice.Lief/Dwayanu is summoned to the land of the Mirage and becomes a troublesome focus point in the conflict of two totally different cultures; one of warrior women led by an exotic witch and the other a race pygmies and their revered human queen. Somehow the author has Lief/Dwayanu become the lover of both ladies!On the surface this story has all the elements of a lurid, dated piece of hackwork. Rest assured Abraham Merritt[1884-1943] was no hack. He was intelligent and knowledgeable of his subject matter but did not neglect the desires of his audience. Certainly this book was written as an entertainment and a grand one it is.Merritt, through the use of introspective asides, ruminates on the issues of scientific explanations for apparent occult manifestations, a familiar theme if your have read any of his other novels particularly "The Moon Pool".This novel was first published in 1932 and last reprinted in paperback in 1991. It is regrettable that Merritt's novels has not been re-printed and re-popularized like those from Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft. Fortunately there have been numerous editions of Merritt's novels and many copies are available for sale on Amazon.

John Brunner (1934-1995) was a prolific science fiction writer, one of many from England that had great commercial success in the United States. Muddle Earth was published in 1993.Admirers of Mr. Brunner's writings, and I count myself as a member of that large community, will, I believe, be somewhat disappointed in this, his last novel. The story is a tongue in cheek satire concerning an individual returned to life - resurrected - after being "frozen" for many years. Not an original story concept by any means but ripe with possibilities. Brunner employees this theme as an opportunity to lampoon just about everything - handled with a sharp barb this approach could be enchanting but Brunner uses a cleaver. There are lots of puns, plays on other science fiction authors names (a medical machine is THEODOR Surgeon, another quack in Wrong Ghoulart and on and on) and a mammoth assortment of robots and disguised aliens playing historical persons - and some from Earth fiction - Sherlock Holmes and Watson for example.A interesting book for the dedicated Brunner fans, but casual readers would be better entertained reading his "The Sheep Look Up" - "Shockwave Rider" - or "Stand on Zanzibar".

John Brunner's novel Polymath, written early in his career, is a gem and highly recommended. This tale about survival on an alien planet by shiploads of refugees escaping from a home world with a star going nova is not very original. In these types of stories we are confronted with, well, the usual: deadly flora and fauna, hostile climate conditions, boisterous settlers and inadequate resources. Brunner uses these familiar themes to create, yes, a fascinating backdrop, but the interaction of diverse character types makes this book exceptional. John Brunner is, in my estimation, a brilliant writer of Science Fiction whose body of works has disappeared from bookshelves since his untimely death in 1995. This book is an excellent introduction to a very underrated writer. Note to readers: there are two versions of this book one published in 1963 and one in 1974. The edition published in 1963 is shorter and substantially different than the 1974 version. This review is based upon the 1974 edition.

In my opinion Gordon R. Dickson (1923-2001) is one of the most consistently entertaining American science fiction authors of the 20th Century.His early novel, Spacial Delivery, first published in 1961, is an excellent example of Mr. Dickson's ability to utilize shopworn SF themes to craft an amusing and perceptive story.The planet Dildia is an object of diplomatic desire for both the humans and their space faring adversaries the Hamnoids. Unfortunately Dildia is inhabited by fully intelligent beings, the bear like Dilbians.Imaging an intelligent bear that walks upright weight about 1500 pounds and stands 9 to 10 feet tall. The Dilbians are a low technology society but have elaborate social codes involving clans and respect for physical strength and individual combat.Both the humans and the Hamnoids must plot to curry favor with the natives at the expense of the other party. Although the diplomatic mystery dancing is not a major plot element it does add a colorful layer of interest and background to the story.John Tardy is "drafted" to serve on Dildia. Like the draft that use to be in effect in the US until President Nixon terminated it, once drafted you have to go where they send you and do what you are told. Tardy is not pleased having his career plans interrupted but he reports for duty on Dildia as ordered.Before I continue I have to inform the reader that the Dilbians names and the names they apply to humans and Hammoids are descriptive, comical and add considerably to the charm and entertainment of this book. The human ambassador, Joshua Guy, "Little Bite" informs Tardy "Half-Pint" that he must rescue a female human, 'Greasy Face" who has been kidnapped by the Dilbian the "Streamside Terror" due to a misunderstanding with his female object of desire "Boy Is She Built'. Tandy, "Half-Pint" is mailed to a show down with the "Streamside Terror". Yes, mailed in a harness attached to the back of one "Hill Bluffer" the local Dilbian mailman. It does sound a little silly but in the context of the story and the world Dickson creates it results in a very entertaining story.

This book is highly recommended for the student and the general reader interested in an overall survey of the Cold War as it was viewed and acted upon by the United States. A book on this topic from the French, British or Russian perspective would be a valuable adjunct to reading this volume. At times the book reads like an expanded outline but that is understandable considering the massive amount of information to be covered from the end of WW-2 to the fall of communism in 1991. For readers of American history on the watch for events and individuals worthy of additional study this book is a gold mine. The ample footnotes, extensive bibliography and index add to the usefulness of this book.

The Hobbits - J.R.R.R. TolkienI would strongly suggest that anyone considering reading Tolkien for the first time choose the "The Hobbits" as their initial book. There is a good reason for this since many of the events that propel the three volume "Fellowship of the Rings" originate in "The Hobbits". The reader is introduced to a full gamut of characters and beings that play critically important roles in subsequent books.I have no interest in summarizing the plot since any discussion along these lines would spoil the revelations to be discovered by new readers.This exceptional fantasy tale that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. This would make a fine book to read to a child. Be sure to set aside a couple of free hours because once you begin this book you will not want to put it down until the last page.

In 1958 using a take-off on a current TV Western as the title, Mr. Heinlein wrote a very popular juvenile novel: "Have Space Suit Will Travel". The counties preoccupation with the "space race" and obsession with the Russian Sputnik could only have contribute to the success of this title.Heinlein use's his considerable writing and scientific talents to craft an unbelievable tale that, nonetheless, inspired many a young space cadet, well, yes, like myself. In light of today's knowledge [2010] the story does not hold up very well and is only of academic interest to serious followers of SF history and the writings of Heinlein.Kip Russell wins a used spacesuit in a contest sponsored by a soap company. He refits the suit as best he can to the condition he believes would be necessary to use in space or on the moon. While on a nocturnal walk in the suit his radio is mistake as a beacon by "space pirates". Kip is hustled away to the moon where he meets Peewee and The Mother Thing both hostages of Wormface. Things pick up and next stop the stars. Thin stuff indeed, but a writer like Heinlein can make cold cuts taste like sirloin.

I have always admired well-known and well-connected individuals who voluntarily put themselves in harms way when they could have very easily avoided military service. I place in this category men such as Ted Williams, John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Stewart just to name a few.Mr. Stewart could, if he had desired, become a "Hollywood Soldier" putting on a uniform for training films and USO shows while not impacting his movie star lifestyle. Instead Stewart enlisted prior to the Pearl Harbor attack as a private and at war's end was a full colonel. His rapid rise as an aviation officer, bomber pilot and commander had nothing to do with his movie star persona but everything to do with his love of country and flying. Although not explicitly stated it was apparent that Steward could of served with distinction in a non-flying military capacity. Steward insisted that he fly as a bomber pilot and is credited with 20 combat missions. Upon returning to Hollywood after the war Steward said he wanted to get back in pictures but no war movie.Certainly this book is about Jimmy Steward illustrious military career but it is also an insightful look at the U.S. bomber operations in England during WW2. The author quotes extensitively from letter, diaries and books to provide the reader with a "you are there" look at aircrew operations and the inherent dangers of flying bomber missions over France and Germany.This book is not a detailed analysis of every aspect of Stewart's wartime service. It is a broad brushed overview and a tribute to a patriotic individual who used his skills and personality in the service of his country.Numerous photographs of Steward, his military buddies, aircraft and family complement this excellent book.

The Byrds - Live at the Fillmore - February 1969One of my favorite songs back in the 1960's was "Eight Miles High". I know there was some discussing that it was a drug song but I always thought of it a travel song. Many of my friends were going to Viet Nam and the unearthly harmonizing on the opening stanza was appropriate, I thought, for where they were headed. The live version on this CD is just short on amazing. The musical improvisations and guitar work on this song is fabulous. It's relegated my studio version to "do not ever play again" list.The rest of this set is exceptional and the sonic quality is flawless. What a thrill it must of been attending a concert featuring this band.David Fricke's notes accompanying this CD are very informative and detail the history of the band and their album releases.Individuals completely unfamiliar with the Byrds may conclude from listening to this excellent live CD that they were primarily a Country and Western band. Granted they do have a C&W; flavor but they were much more that that. To those listeners I would refer them to the booklet to see who wrote the songs recorded.This Columbia Legacy CD was issued in 2000. The notes state that all tracts previously unreleased. Highly recommended for fans and the curious.

Howard Philip Lovecraft (1890-1937) did not have a high regard for his novelette "Shadow Over Innsmouth". To paraphrase from the Wikipedia: Lovecraft wrote to August Derleth that the story "has all the defects I deplore especially in point of style, where hackneyed phrases & rhythms have crept in despite all precautions.... No I don't intend to offer 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' for publication, for it would stand no chance of acceptance". It was eventually published as a slim book with a run of 200 copies. The only book of Lovecraft's fiction distributed during his lifetime. August Derleth called The Shadow Over Innsmouth " a dark, brooding story, typical of Lovecraft at his best."Not withstanding Lovercraft's oppinion this reader believes that the "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" to be a spendid example of HPL's fictional writings and exhibits many of the compelling theams used in his other works.I will attempt a very abbreviated summary of the plot with no spoilers. Our narrator, who is never named, undertakes a "tour of New England for sightseeing, antiquarian and genealogical - and had planned to go to Newburyport and on to Arkham whence my mother's family was derived". He takes a dilapidated old bus that makes the Newburyport - Innsmouth - Arkham run only to have it break down in Arkham stranding him for the night. The back-story of strangeness and horrors in Arkham are conveyed to the narrator by three individuals: the curator at the Newburyport Historical Society, a clerk in the First National (grocery) Store in Innsmouth and by the most intriguing character in the story 96 year old Zadok Allen, town drunkard. The narrator escaped Innsmouth and capture by the very peculiar inhabitants with the help of a map given to him by the store clerk.I suspect readers new to Lovecraft will finds this story more than mildly confusing what with all the unexplained terms, Lovercraft's over the top descriptions of terror and the maze like journey thought Innsmouth's many streets.Lovecraft peppers his story with terms that beg a description but none are giving. We encounter the old topper Zadok Allen and his mouths "R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga" with no explanation and asks his listener if "ever hear tell of shoggoth?' A what, you say. The narration visits Miskatonic University in Arkham. This town and school show up in several other stories but you would not know it from this tale. Several references are made to the "Esoteric Order of Dagon". Hmmm sounds very creepy. Fan of HPL relish these links to other stories but new readers be warned.Lovecraft had a way with words and used them, overused some would say, to convey the atmosphere of dread or creepiness he was attempting. For example: "It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange, unearthly splendor of the alien, opulent phantasy of the tiara...the pattern on the piece hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abyss in time and space". Innsmouth is a "Festering city of death and decay". Zadok lays it on thick also "Thar's whar it all begun-the cursed place of all wickedness where the deep water starts. Gates o' hell-sheer drop daown to a bottom no saoudin' line kin tech." and "Yew want to know what the reel horror is, hey? Wal, it's this- it ain't what thern fish devils haz done, but it's what they're a-goin' to do! They're a-bringin' things up aout o' whar they come from into the taown....ever hear tell of a shoggoth?" My favorite is "Haow'd ye like to be livin' in a taown like this, with everthing a-rottin' an' dyin' boarded up monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an hoppin' aroun' black cellars and attics every where ye turn?" Whew what a place!Well, it does not take much common sense to know that Innsmouth is no place to be if the fish-frog guys are after you so take out your map and make tracks. Lovecraft knew where he was going but I could never figure out his directions, for example: "At Bates Street I drew into a yawing vestibule...was soon on my way again approaching where Eliot Street crossed Washington at the intersection of South." Later the directions are, well, confusing " I edged around into Babson which crossed Federal...noised continued on Washington...darted around the corner into Lafayette Street and crossed Eliot...my greatest dread was re-crossing South Street" and on and on.If you want to "dig in' to this story, and I hope you do, get a map of the fictional town of Innsmouth. Do a search on the internet, find it and print it out. Now it all makes sense.Now about those mysterious terms shoggoth, Dagon, R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga and ol' Miskatonic U. Well, you don't need to know about them to just enjoy the story unless, of course, you just have to know...well that's what Google is for!Ok, "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn", which translates as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. Is it time to read another Lovecraft story?Added 03-14-2011There is another level of interest concerning this story that may appeal to the curiosity of some readers. Thoughout the text Lovecraft incorporated numerous real place and family names from Essex County in Massachusetts; in addition there are subtle references to other Lovecraft stories. If you are intrigued by this tale and motivated to fill your cranium with a lot of useless but interesting bits of trivia read the Necronomicon Press edition of the illustrated and annotated "The Shadow over Innsmouth". The book contains 150 detailed footnotes, a 15 pages introduction, a discarded draft of the story and 5 full-page illustrations by Jason Eckhardt. The two paperback editions of this title (1994,97) have long been out of print but copies are available used.Oh yes, I was raised in Essex County and have visited many of the towns he enjoyed visiting and writing about.

I had watched the Errol Morris movie "The Fog of War" several times. The integration of period footage, interviews with Robert Strange McNamara and the music are film making at it's creative best in my oppinion.As a long time admirer Philip Glass I recently purchased the music to "Fog of War". After listening to the sound tract CD several times I viewed the film again and can only marvel at how the music complements the various chapters of McNamara's comments.In the notes accompanying the CD Errol Morris states "I once told Phillip that he creates a feeling of existential dread better that anyone I know of. And this is a movie filled with existential dread."

"A War To Be Won" - Fighting the Second World War" - Murray & MillettThe book "A War To Be Won" is a very useful one-volume introduction to the Second World War. In addition to it's 576 pages of text are 23 pages of maps, 128 fully captioned photographs, notes, suggested readings, an index and four appendixes: Military organization, Conduct of the War, Weapons and Exploring WW2. The book's twenty chapter take the reader chronologically through the conflict with two introductory chapters "Origins of a Catastrophe" and "The revolution in Military Operations, 1919-1939" providing a backdrop. Each chapter is subdivided with bold capitalized headings and has a concluding paragraph.The book is an academic history of the war for sure. Nonetheless the author's livens up the text with some curious and fascinating comments and observations. I has bookmark several and list few below:P152 discussing warlords in China "An American favorite, Feng Yu-hsiang, a nominal Christian who baptized his troops with fire hoses."P263 "Churchill hectored, badgered, and drove his colleagues ceaselessly in his pursuit of victory. He was not an easy man to get along with in the best of times, and under the pressures of war he was at times insufferable."P266 "Rommel proved himself the premier battlefield commander of the war...he was a devoted student of military history and his profession...he was a leader of men, with a profound ability to inspire his troops to do their utmost in the face of enormous difficulties."P272 "Eisenhower's enthusiastic and jovial personality led far to many to underestimate a will of iron and an extraordinary intelligence."P272 "George Marshall had impressed virtually everyone he came in contact with except Douglas MacArthur, who was always hostile to those who were his equal."P300 "George Patton aroused the fighting spirit of U.S. troops, even if at times he churned up more hatred for himself than the Germans. George Patton was one of the most bizarre characters produced by the United States Military Academy and the United States Army."P336 "U.S. Admiral Ernest King raged at subordinates in public, ruled his bridge with fear, and railed at incompetents and offices he thought too charming. He made life miserable for anyone around him, including his wife and seven children, by chain-smoking, binge-drinking and flagrant philandering."P530 "British men might grouse about the Yanks being overpaid, oversexed and over here, but the GIs were also overfed and they knew it...The Army demonstrated its confidence that it could provide GIs with food in abundance by calculating the allowance for toilet tissue per solider station in Britain at 22.5 sheets per day. The comparable British ration was 3 sheets."I was drawn to this book from an interest in U.S. Presidential History. I am an admirer of Franklin Roosevelt and have read several biographies. One of the central issues of his Presidency was WW2. To say the least there have been quite a few books written about WW2 but I required a book that covered the whole war. I was very satisfied that this book provided me with sufficient information to partially understand the incredible nightmare that my parents and family lived through.It took me almost three months to complete reading this book. The fact of the matter was the substantial amount of detailed information on each page. I found this not a book I could absorb in large amounts. Don't misunderstand, this book, although very scholarly, is written in a manner an intelligent high school student could understand. The issue for me the sheer amount of information presented. I had to let things ruminate awhile before I continued reading.

My edition of this book is subtitled " Book 1 in the chronicles of Narnia". Interestingly the author wanted this book read after "The Magician's Nephew" where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals. I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read "Nephew" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!In any event "Wardrobe" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a "magic" wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor. It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story, after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading. One of the pleasures for this reader was the illustration at the beginning of each chapter by Pauline Baynes.

The following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of His Excellency George Washington by Joseph Ellis and narrated by Nelson Runger.The audio book consists of 13 CD's and runs about 15 hours. Each CD is indexed into numbered tracks of 3 to 4 minuet lengths. The audio quality is uniformly excellent as had been my experiences with "Recorded Books" audio CD's. This listener found the narrator, Mr. Runger, an excellent speaker who clears pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too. Mr. Runger assumes a distinctive "voice" when reading direct quotes from Washington and other key players. I found these `voices" complemented the listening experience; although a less skilled narrator employing that technique could be very distracting.I have recently completed my 2nd listening of this audio book. After my first listening session was completed I was motivated to seek out other books detailing certain aspects of Washington's life particularly his experiences in the French and Indian War.Concerning the story told by Mr. Ellis I can only say it is a masterful rendering of the life of Washington and highly recommended.

Poul Anderson (1926-2001) was a prolific writer of science fiction. His 34 novels can be categorized as primarily elaborate space-adventure tales. His talent was in creating likable characters and well thought out alien worlds. His stories of aliens, imaginary worlds and futuristic societies were plausible and, equally important entertaining. His novel "The High Crusade" is, in this reviewer's opinion, a good read for a young teens but adults will I fear not be entertaining.The High Crusade, written early in Mr. Anderson's career- 1960 - is a "space-adventure" with an odd twist. We are confronted with another of the well-worn themes used by SF authors: the what-if story. An interstellar space ship lands in 1345 England full of blue skinned aliens. Sir Roger and his army of English knights and yeomen overpower the aliens and with the assistance of a captured blue-skin return to the alien's home planet. The English knights defeat the local military; out fox alien armies using 14th Century siege techniques and eventual become Masters of the Local Universe. How this could happen boggles the imagination.In 1960 when I first read this book it was one of my favorite stories. In 2010 I decided to re-read it having obtained a new edition. Time has not been kind to this story. Anderson just glosses over any plot contradictions. Any concepts that may seem absurd are just not discussed. Young readers will probably love it but adults familiar with Anderson's excellent SF novels will be squirming to finish it.I cannot recommend this book to anyone but the most confirmed fans of Poul Anderson. The plot was preposterous and lacked any credibility whatsoever. An alien race with Faster-Than-Light drive, a militaristic society with all the death toys needed to conquer other space faring races defeated by men on horses with swords and shields...you have been warned.

"This was the Earth, he thought - a planet made for Man. But not for Man alone, for it was as well a planet for the fox and owl and weasel, for the snake, the katydid, the fish, for all the other teeming life that filled the air and earth and water. And not for these natives alone, but for other beings that called other worlds earths their home, other planets that far light-years distant were basically the same as Earth". From "Way Station""Way Station" (1963) can be read as a thoughtful and, at times mesmerizing science fiction novel. In fact it was winner of two prestigious awards, which attest to its popularity. It is also a story that forces one to consider our notion of human destiny and the motivating spirit that we mostly tune out as so much background noise.Enoch Wallace, during his Civil war service had contemplated the starry sky and speculated about life 'up there". Thought serendipity circumstances he finds himself custodian on an intergalactic transfer station for varied and assorted extraterrestrial beings. This custodianship has lasted for over 100 years and comes with the benefit of greatly extended life - a mixed blessing as we find out as the story unfolds. The being that recruited Enoch tells him to consider the "Way Station" as a rest and recover stopover on a continuing journey. No one visits the Earth since it is considered too primitive and backwards for alien contact.What makes this book noteworthy, I believe, is the extraordinary narrative creativity Simak infuses into the story. Startling ideas and concepts seem to burst right out of the pages. His ideas have the ring of believability and apparent credability and have an honest resonance with us readers in our time and place in cosmic history. It would be unfair to potential readers to wax and wan about this or that concept - after all reading and discovery are part of the guilty pleasure derived from reading fiction - so I won't be a spoiler!Enoch Wallace the station master (no, he is not called that in the story) is a very interesting character. Lets start with his name Enoch - "Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and was seen no more: because God took him" Gen 5.24. Simak does not attribute angelic status upon him but he does some startling things and has some unique abilities - another reason to enjoy this delightful story.This reader has one big issue with the story, which, hopefully, will not deter you from reading it. The author intertwines several absorbing plot threads builds then to a climax only to resolve them with the most implausible coincidences. Perhaps there was no other way to close out the story but I found it disconcerting nonetheless.

Tarnsman of GorAs a stand alone novel in the genre of Lost Land Adventures this book was a "just fair" read. As a multi volume series it's an example of how modest popularity breeds mediocrity.Let me just say that "Gor" is just an awful name although it does not take up much room on the book cover and it is easy to spell.Gor, we are informed, is the counter Earth - on the other side of the sun - therefore we never see it or for that matter know it exist - a blessing perhaps. Gor is a land of medieval feudalism except for two things - Tarns - large half wild birds that, if willing, will support a rider and a hidden religious sect that exerts enormous control over Gor's society. One area where the Priesthood power has a direct effect over the warriors of Gor [of which, it seems, most men are on this planet] is their restriction of certain technology that would result in the development superior weapons. So what you say...well read the book.My opinion was that the story was dull and the characters duller. I was also put off by the similarity with other, better books, dealing with the same subject matter. I am not inclined to read any other books in the series. I seems that by the number of volumes published my opinions are in the minority.

Nick and the Glimmung, we are informed on this book's flyleaf, is Dick's sole surviving young adult novel written in 1966 and available for the first time in the U.S., and the first time anywhere in twenty years.The story is typical of much of Dick's works: brilliant ideas and concepts, disjointed and confusing plotting, thin character development and a conclusion with a barrel of loose ends mostly unresolved. In other words a story that will delight Dick's many fans and perplex the casual reader.The story concerns young Nick and his cat Horace. You see cats are illegal on Earth so Nick's family decided to emigrate to Plowman's Planet instead of giving up their pet. Upon arriving at their destination the family is quickly introduced to several different alien species that speak perfect English and become entangled in a struggle concerning a magical book one of the aliens lost and was recovered by Nick. Nick also discovers pod people growing outside his home, an intelligent rodent-like species talking 1950's slang and a being that replicated home appliances like toasters but they don't function properly.The Subterranean Press edition of this title is an exceptionally well-designed book with four full-page Phil Parks color illustrations supplementing the 121 pages of large font text.

"The time is out of joint; O cursed spite!/That ever I was born to set it right!"...HamletSpeaking Vic: "The time" Ragle said, "is out of joint - I think we should compare notes" from Time Out Of Joint"Time Out of Joint", first published in 1959, is not one of his PKD's better known or critically acclaimed novels. Nonetheless it is a story I greatly admire. It concerns a man, Ragle Gumm, who makes his living by consistently correctly solving a newspaper puzzle contest: "Where Will the Little Green Man be Next?"At first this odd story appears quite mundane. Set against the background of small town suburbia life in the 1950's - nothing appears to out of the ordinary. Ragle Gumm's brother-in-law is a grocer, his young nephew gets into minor schoolboy mischief, he plays cards in the evening and there is an undercurrent of infidelity with the neighbor's wife. Slowly like a cat creeping across the lawn on a moonless night the weirdness starts to set in. Someone looks for a pull cord for a bathroom light they swore was always there and finds a wall switch. Small slips of paper with item names are found under or near where the item previously was thought to be located. Televisions are found in homes but no radios.A modestly paced story that engaged this reader as the plot unfolds but, unfortunately, marred by an ending that seem forced and out of place. It is my oppinion that the more you know about PKD the better you can appreciate this story.Additional comments August 2012I re-read this novel recently and it occurred to me that part of its charm is the "period" the story is set in. Dick wrote it in 1957-8 and peppers his story with references to then popular culture and politics. The seemingly abrupt "science-fiction" endings becomes more credible upon another reading.A strange and intriguing book worth another read if you're so inclined.

"Swords of Lankhmar" is the fifth volume in the adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Fans of Leiber need to know that fact but new readers can start right in with this book and catch up with the others if so motivated.In city of Lankhmar our friends are hired to ride shotgun on a convoy of grain ships across the Inner Sea to the city of Movarl. The reason for the extra security is that previous convoys have not only failed to reach it's destination but have all disappeared without a trace.During the voyage one of the ships is attacked by what appear to be highly intelligent rats. Only the intervention of a dragon with an appetite for those tasty rodents saves the ship and for than matter the entire convoy. Upon returning to Lankhmar the Grey Mouser and Fafhrd find that their report of events is ridiculed by the Prince as being preposterous and are sent from the council chamber disgraced.As events unfold the Prince's foremost confidants are in league with the rodents who maintain a hidden civilization under Lankhmar. A reprehensible plot is stirring to replace human rule and substitute rats rule. Our hero's smell a rat, or rats and with swords and sorcery restore equilibrium to Lankhmar in the land of Nehwon.

From an old paperback edition of this title: "Far in the future gallant knights in armor battle the wild forces of a dying technology"This book is, in my opinion, a benchmark that all heroic fantasy will be measured against. Harrison is able to portray the true reality of conflict - those that profess to live for it are truly dead inside, regardless of what side they fight for. This is a truism that is absent in most books of this type.The plot is standard fare: in the late afternoon of earth the remnants of humanity rut in the ruins of the past, technology is lost and society is a mixture of atomic cannons drawn by horses, airships battling for kingdoms and man facing oblivion. Two Queens vie for the same throne, a war begins, one side employees an alien relic of the past- giants that are nearly indestructible. The giants are uncontrollable and turn on their masters, a quest is begun to find the method of destroying the giants.As a plot this would be a routine fantasy saga; what raises this above all others [of the type] is Harrison's use of language and some of the most refreshing characters in a fantasy novel in a long, long time. A great book a must re-read someday.

"Black in Time" by noted author John Jakes is an entertaining and perceptive time-travel novel. America's future as envisions in this story is bleak indeed. A riot which resulted in a white policemen being killed is all the reason a charismatic white minister needs to goad his acolytes to start a race war so the blacks can be put in their place once and for all. A man of color forces a black scientist to take him back in time so he can do the unthinkable - alter history by any means including murdering so the black race rules the future not the white. The charm of this book is the author's use of actual historical events and personalities - it's almost a black history primer.In his introduction to "Black in Time"(1970) Jakes states the following: "Of the two dozen or more science-fiction novels I wrote during the 1960's I am fondest of two or three, "Black in Time" is one of those. The author's admiration aside this title has only been published twice, both paperback editions - the last being in 1988. Bart Book published the 1988 edition.John Jakes, author of several very popular historical fiction series, started his career writing fantasy and science fiction stories for pulp magazines in the 1950's and 1960's. This may come as a surprise to many of his fans since none of his early fiction has been republished for many years.I am no fan of time-travel stories - I just cannot buy-in to the idea. I will say this: the author has considerable talent breathing life into a historical place and event. Overall an interesting book if you are so inclined.

Recently I had read "War That Made America - A Short History of the French and Indian War" by Fred Anderson. I was particularly taken with chapter 21 - "The Plains of Abraham". A pivotal battle, two seasoned commanders, events hinge on apparent chance and then both leaders are killed in battle - an amazing story told extremely well. I made a mental note to check Osprey Publications to determine if they have a title related to this battle.My search was fruitful and I purchased "Quebec 1759 The Battle That Won Canada" by Stuart Reid. Utilizing extensive illustrations the author introduces us to the principal French and British officers; provides detailed descriptions of the various forces and their uniforms and equipment. The focus in this book is the military events, who were the belligerents, what equipment they use, where they camped, how many soldiers each army fielded, how many cannons they employed...you get the idea. This is not a geo-political analysis describing why the British traveled to Quebec in 1759 and fought the French. That very interesting story is told in "War That Made America - A Short History of the French and Indian War" mentioned above.Readers new to Osprey titles should be aware all books from this published are similar in size to a National Geographic magazine with a thicker paper cover. The page count of this title was 98 and contained many period artwork and drawing reproductions, several full color painting created especially for this title and 3 double pages maps showing troop placements and battle progress.

This setting for this excellent Jack Vance story is identical to his "The Dying Earth' collection. This "novel" was first published as individual but related stories in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in the 1960's. We are in the far, far future on a earth illuminated by a swollen red sun. Wizards and magic have long replaced scientist and technology. Vance fashions a bizarre world redolent with an overpowering atmosphere of unknown danger and lurking peril. Nothing is, as it seems.What we have is an absorbing quest chronicle with a strong component of twisted revenge. What make this story excel is the protagonist: Cugel the Clever as he is so named. In reality he should be called Cugel the weasel or as it transpires Cugel the incompent amateur thief. Cugel is so convinced of his own capability that he blunders into circumstances that any normal wizardly type would pass on in a heartbeat.The story gets underway with Cugel making a very unfortunate decision: he helps himself to the magic paraphernalia and assorted gadgets belonging to Iucouna, one very powerful and vegenceful magician. Cugel the not so Clever is apprehended and for his bungled attempt at larceny is made subject to Iucouna's lively and ingenious discipline. The magician sends him on a simple expedition: travel to a distant land and return with an enchanted lens. To insure that Cugel does not stray from his duties and maintains his devotion and dedication to the given task Iucouna assigns a cantankerous imp. The imp, perceiving any deviations or slacking off by Cugel administers a memorable jolt to the liver.With this background established early in the book Vance takes us on a grand tour of the Dying Earth. It is a world full of magical beings and dangers. This reader found Cugel's ability to wiggle out of near impossible situations and reluctantly complete his quest, with strong encouragement from the imp of course, a very enjoyable reading experience and is highly recommended.

The authors are to be commended for their ability to describe and detail the events of 1775-81 in lively and readable manner. The vivid descriptions of the key players caused me to seek their biographies. If I were a history teacher I would make this book required reading as a worthwhile overview of the period. One aspect of our revolution that has always intrigued me is the role France played. Without the infusion of French gold, weapons and eventually direct military assistance our revolution would not of succeeded. This point has been sadly overlooked, downplayed or "forgotten" by the casual survey courses taught in High School. This book clearly make the point that without France we may still be part of the British Empire. Highly recommended as an engaging introduction to the military and political events that resulted in America's independence from England.

Clifford Simak, 1904-88, noted science fiction author, wrote several novels that could best be described as fantasy, although I will be the first to admit that parsing the dividing line between science-fiction and fantasy can result in contentious discussions and disagreements. Nonetheless this novel, "Out of Their Minds" (1970) is in my oppinion more fantasy than science fiction. Does it matter? Well, it does to some, for sure. To the casual reader I strongly suspect not. And it is to those readers I direct my admittedly opinionated comments.Horton Smith, protagonist of this novel, is experiencing what was years ago referred to as a mid-life crises. A successful and well-known newsman Horton decides to chuck his life in Washington D.C. and drive cross-country to his boyhood Midwestern hometown of Pilot Knob in order to fish and write a novel. Strange things start happening, very strange things. A close friend is killed in a mysterious auto accident. Taking an apparent wrong turn on his journey he has a bizarre encounter with comic book-like folks and a decidedly unfriendly snake. Upon arrived in his home town most folk greet him like the prodigal son except for one group of punks who decide to give him a real country homecoming. One of the young Turks shows up dead after the encounter and Joe goes on the lam to dodge the vigilantes. The local schoolteacher who he had befriended rescues him from a pack of wolfs who just disappear when her headlights shine on them and then the devil makes an appearance.Fortunately for us readers Simak inserted a "document" into the novel - chapter 5 - that make us privy to cause of the weirdness. In the form of a letter from his friend killed in the auto accident this 11 page "theory" proposes the idea that mankind's mental evolution has created an alternative universe of sorts inhabited by all manner of our imaginary creations - cartoon characters, monsters and the Devil. Now these creations want to merge with our "reality".Simak had sufficient name recognition in the science-fiction community so he could of very easily spent his writing career cranking out mindless outer-space potboilers. His foray into fantasy shows an author who was not content with the path of least resistance but a writer who could experiment and take creative risks.In point of fact this is an entertaining novel with just enough loopy logic to keep disbelief suspended and the pages turning. May you enjoy it also.

Donovan of O.S.S. - Corey FordIn his introduction author Cory Ford informs the readers that this book is not a history of the O.S.S. - Office of Strategic Services - but a story about William J. ("Wild Bill") Donovan. Ford was a colonel in the Air Force and served under Donovan at the O.S.S. The reader is left to surmise how objective the author will be concerning his subject. Donovan is primarily known as the "Father of American Intelligence" and the "Father of Central Intelligence." This book does not provide any critical insites into the murky history of intelligence. Another factor to consider is that this book was written in 1969 and many archives were unavailable to authors doing research.We are left with with an interesting story about a remarkable man. Donovan was able to marshall and direct the efforts of many individuals to create from the ground up an effective intelligence service under the intense pressures of wartime.The aspect of this book that interested me was the details of Donovan's service during World War I. He organized and led a battalion of New York Volunteers, the "Fighting 69th" and for his service in France he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Ford brings to life the battles and heroism of that tragic, unnecessary war.This book is recommend for readers interested in World War I and for a general discussions of intelligence services, there organization and methods.

After have read and enjoyed author Vidal's Lincoln and Burr I was to some extent disappointed with this book - the third in his semi fictional American History series. The narrator, Charlie Schuyler, is Burr's illegitimate son returned from France with his titled daughter. Using his considerable skills as a writer and many contacts in New York he works to rescue the family financial fortunes.Vidal employs his sharp wit and biting sense of irony scrutinizing the last year of the scandal beset Grant administration and the 1876 election. Charlie Schuyler, employed as a political reporter, has a ringside seat to survey all of the political mischief and associated back room wheeling and dealing. He has a personal stake in the election outcome: a prior arrangement as the ambassador to France if Governor Tilton of New York is elected.When Vidal is conveying detail of the depressing tale of voter fraud and influence pedaling the story is compelling reading. Unfortunately for this reader long sections of this novel concerns the comings and going of New York high society and long forgotten politicians. I am just not seeped in the knowledge of the era so I found many chapters tedious and uninteresting. Nonetheless I would recommend this book just for the enthralling story of the 1876 election.

"The Lord of Thunder" (1962) by Andre Norton (1912-2005) is a sequel to her novel "The Beast Hunter" (1959). Interested readers may ask is it absolutely necessary that I read "Beast Hunter" before "Lord of Thunder"? If you can you should. "Beast Hunters" provided a substantial amount of background information concerning the central characters that play important roles in "Lord of Thunder". Is it absolute necessary? - no, but it would be very helpful nonetheless.In "The Beast Hunter" the readers become acquainted with Hosteen Storm a Navajo Indian and cashiered veteran of an interstellar war and his exploits on the planet Arzor dealing with enemy aliens, exploring an ancient civilization and befriending the humanoid intelligent natives called the Norbies.Most of the story in "Lord of Thunder" concerns a quest to find a missing person and then a crazed earthman through seemingly endless underground caverns full of mysterious artifacts, flashing lights and humming machines. Whenever Hosteen Storm appears to be trapped and about to face his demise a friend, native, constable or one of his trained beast shows up to rescue him and keep the plot moving.I am a great admirer of Andre Norton books but I was disappointed with "Lord of Thunder". The narrative appeared to be forced, paragraphs were greatly extended with generic descriptions of traveling throught gloomy caves adding little to the story and, honestly, I found myself skimming down pages - something I have never done before reading a story by Ms Norton. "Lord of Thunder" while utilizing the same characters adds very little to the fascinating story of Arzor it's history or it's peoples. Fans should certainly read this book. Casual readers should read "The Beast Hunter" and skip this title.

These comments are for the audio cassette version of "Truman" by David McCullough copyright 1994 by Simon & Schuster and the author. The audio book consists of 4 cassette tapes and total run time of 6 hours. David McCullough reads which, in my oppinion, adds considerably to the pleasure of listening to these tapes. Author McCullough has an exceptional reading voice. His pacing, tone and inflections to convey emotions are right on for this material.I thought I had a good working knowledge of Harry Truman but my knowledge was primarily his presidential years. McCullough spend a good deal of time discussing his upbringing, family roots and WWI experiences - new and welcomed data for this reader.One aspect of this audio book that makes it an exceptional listening experience is the inclusion of excerpts from Truman's Presidential addresses to Congress and important speeches. You actually experience a "you are there" feeling when hearing Truman's actual words during key events of his Presidency.A final note on audiocassettes books. I write these comments in 2011 so that makes these tapes 17 years old. I have no idea how long audio recording will last but these four tapes played without any mechanical problems and the audio was excellent. I paid a dollar for this item at a used book store. So if you have a tape player you can save some money and enjoy lots of great audio for small dollars I in fact ALL my dollars are small these days.

"Plague Planet" is the 2nd book that chronicles the adventures of the free trader starship Solar Queen. In Ms Norton's carefully crafted universe of space exploration and exploitation two commercial enterprises are attempt to reap enormous financial benefits by trading, bartering or hoodwinking intelligent alien races. You can think of the Dutch buying Manhattan Island for a trunk full of beads. The first group consists of "five great galaxy wide organizations" these combines intend to dominant trading and muscle out the independent competitions. The Solar Queen represents the independent free traders - the good guys. One of the major topics in the story is the fierce completion and resulting bad feelings between the combines and the free traders. Overlaying this is the Space Patrol and a Code of Ethics or trading behavior, rules and regulations that attempt to prevent the most blatant violations of the native rights or outright commercial sabotage. The Patrol and the Code are referenced thought the story but are never adequately described which detracts from the story in my oppinion.The first third of this novel is most interesting and features great creativity and imagination when detailing the intelligent feline-like natives, the Salariki, of the planet Sargol. The descriptions of the native society, clan structure, emphasis of the use of perfumes and attitudes towards off-worlders and their trade trinkets make for captivating reading. Alas, after a few opening chapters its "jets up" and the remainder of the story is a so-so space adventure concerning, well, a plague on the spaceship. An interesting book that will keep you turning pages to see how it a shakes out; another one of Ms Norton's entertaining Solar Queen stories.Ms Norton wrote four novels that could be grouped under the heading "Space Adventures of the free trader starship Solar Queen" The novels are also referred to as the "Solar Queen" books. The books and the first publication date are as follows: Sargasso of Space (1955), Plague Ship (1956), Voodoo Planet (1959) and Postmarked the Stars (1969). Each of these books stands alone but interested readers should attempt to read the books in sequence if available. Three additional "Solar Queen" books were written in the 1990's in collaboration with other authors. I am very suspect of these "collaborations" that seem to pop up like weeds late in an author's life. Was Ms. Norton's contribution just her name and the rights to the story line? I don't know the answer but I steer away from these types of books.

Clarence Gatemouth Brown - Long Way HomeOk I purchased this CD based upon the real cool, shall we say iconic cover photo. I mean here is the neat looking guy in a fancy country and western shirt smoking a pipe sitting on the back end of a candy-apple red vintage coupe. The CD had to be good!Seriously it was good, very good. In addition to the talented Clarence Gatemouth Brown (1925-2005) it featuring a terrific lineup of musicians and singers: Eric Clapton, Ry Cooder, Leon Russell, John D. Loudermild, Bobby Charles, Maria Muldaur and others.Take a good look at the songs on this album and imagine if you will how great they must sound with Brown, Clapton, Cooder, Muldaur etc participating. Why, you may want to just rush out and purchase a copy - you will not be disappointed.Just for the record the album was recorded in 1995 in Maurice, Louisiana.

Poul Anderson (1926-2001) wrote primary "hard" science-fiction stories featuring aliens; interstellar travel and planetary adventures. This novel, A Midsummer Tempest, is one of his rare forays into the Fantasy genre.The setting is England 1640. The country is engulfed by civil war. Prince Rupert is on the side of King Charles as they contend with the forces of Cromwell. During a brutal skirmish Rupert and his lackey escaped into an charmed forest where he meets up with the "little people: Rupert and his companion are then engaged upon a "mission" for a "ring of power". This is the classic fantasy-adventure formula: the journey, pursuit by the adversary, a love interest, a sea voyage, narrow escape and a satisfactory ending.Nothing very original here, but Anderson's crisps dialog, descriptive and believable action sequences propels the plot in an agreeable manner and to a satisfactory conclusion. An excellent read if these types of stories interest you.

The following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of "11 Days in December - Christmas at the Bulge, 1944" by Stanley Weintraub. Patrick Cullen reads the book.On December 16, 1944 the Germans, or more specifically Hitler, decided to attack the allies in a desperate bid to end the war or at least obtain a more favorable negotiated peace.As the author clearly details a combination of diverse circumstance almost reversed the allies hard won advances towards Germany. Christmas holiday leaves granted many troops and senior officers; the wishful belief held by many that the war was just about over, mass desertions by British and American forces and the atrocious weather and terrain all combined to give Hitler an advantage that was masterfully exploited.The author's intent is to tell the story through the words of many diverse participants on both sides. The extensive use of direct quotes gives this story a startling degree of realism.I found some aspects of this narrative particularly riveting. The description of the intense rivaliary between the British - Montgomery - and the American high command was disheartened. The fate of the allies POW's is detailed in heart wrenching details. The wretched life of the enlisted solders that had to burn their Christmas mail and gifts as they retreated from the German onslaught breaks your heart.My knowledge of European geography is limited. I had to stop the disk and refer to maps of the battle area in order to fully visualize what was transpiring. This is one of the unfortunate limitations of listening to a book were knowledge of place and location are essential to fully understand the story.This audio book consist 5 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 5 and one-half hours. Blackstone Audio published the audio book.The disks are secured in the standard fan fold multi CD holder. The holder slides into the external packaging box.Blackstone audio indexes the tracks on each disk in 3-minute segments. I found this very helpful finding my place on a disk or finding a particular segment to play again.For individuals, like myself, who do not have a more that superficial knowledge of the events that transpired and the players involved this was a very useful and informative audio book.

As a serious student of the US Vietnam War but who never served in that country I have often wondered just what it was like to be there - in that country during the War. In particular what was it like for the combat soldier. Let it be understood I have respect for those individuals who served in support positions - the tasks they performed were essential, but those most exposed to mortal danger were the enlisted or drafted army and marine infantry soldiers. None of my veteran friends or relatives would discuss their experiences with me in any detail.I have read a dozen or so memoirs of combat experiences in Vietnam. Some were quite good, all were informative. James Ebert's 1993 book "A Year in the Life - The American Infantryman in Vietnam" attempts to give a complete overview of the entire combat experience from induction and basic training to getting short and then taking the freedom bird back to the states. The author distilled over sixty interviews with veterans and created a narrative that walks the reader through a combat tour. Using extensive quotes and summary paragraphs we are provided an understanding of what these young men experienced.In my opinion this book would go on my very short list of essential reading for understanding the US combat experience in Vietnam. In retrospect one can only ponder with respect and admiration the patriotic sacrifice made by so many fine individuals in a cause that was predestined for failure from it's conception.

An emergency blood transfusion from a nameless donor results in bodily rejuvenation and immortality. The donor and his progeny go underground while a syndicate funded by malevolent oldsters attempts to locate the supply of blood.Author Gunn's crisp writing style, reasonably believable subject matter and attention to character development resurrects this book from premature obscurity.This novel, first published in 1962, consists of four related stories fixed-up as a novel. The titles of the stories are, in the order published, "New Blood", "Donor", "Medic" and "Immortal".This was a noteworthy novel in its time. It was the source for an "ABC Movie of The Week" in 1969 and a 1970 television series "The Immortal".

The follow comments are for the book "Lincoln and Chief Justice Taney" - Slavery, Secession, and the President's War Powers by James F. Simon.My motivation for reading this book was to acquire information and satisfy my curiosity concerning Roger B. Taney (1777-1864) who was Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court during the period 1836-64. During the past several years I have read several Lincoln biographies and related books concerning the Civil War. Justice Taney is mentioned in all these books having played a notable role during the period he was in office but particularly during the War Between the States.I have no legal training and a laymen's knowledge of judicial terminology. My only exposure to "the law" was several months of jury duty. I approached this book with some trepidation since an eminent law professor is the author. In fact, James Simon is the dean emeritus of the New York Law School. I can report that inquiring readers with little legal knowledge can profit from reading this book since the author's intent is to enlighten a general audience not just legal professionals.I found the discussion of Taney's close relationship with Andrew Jackson and their joint efforts in opposition to the central bank fascinating. As U.S. Attorney General(1831-1833) and then Secretary of the Treasury(1833-1834), Taney became one of Andrew Jackson's closest advisers.His peers held Taney's judicial expertise in very high regard particularly his ability to make the most difficult legal problems seem clear. William Wirt, who would later serve as U.S. Attorney General said that he, Taney, was a man with a "Moonlight Mind", explaining that "like moonlight of the arctic he gave all the light of day without the glare".The core of this book are the issues revolving around Lincoln and the his efforts to preserve the Union. For that discussion alone this book is highly recommended.

The notable American writer Lloyd Alexander (1924-2007) won several awards for the 5 volume "Prydian Chronicles". The first book in that series is "The Book of Three" published in 1963.The following comments are for the unabridged audio book version of "The Book of Three" copyright 2004 by Random House. The audio book consists of 4 cassette tapes with a total play time of 5 hours and 3 mins. James Langton reads and does a commendable job with both the pronunciations and the changing of his voice as he represents the various characters.I was pleased that this audio book was unabridged so my comments can be based upon the entire contents not just some editorial decision of what to leave out and what to include.I well understand that these books are beloved by many readers but I must be honest and state that I am not inclined to listen or read any the additional volumes in the series. I found the plot convolutions predictable, the fantasy characters clich&eacute;d and the "quest" analogous to those found in Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and other writers. I am sure if I had read these books in the 60's and 70's, as a young adult I would of loved them. Of course I would not of had any knowledge of the literature to judge them against.I would certainly recommend these books to young readers and then urge them to followed up with Lord Dunsany, Jack Vance, Lewis, Tolkien and Lovecraft if they find an interest in these types of tales.

Alexei Panshin's "Rite of Passage" won the 1968 Nebula Award. This yearly award is given for the "best" novel as voted by the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.The science-fiction elements surrounding the story of a young girls rite of passage to adulthood are fairly standard: huge starships "seeded" habitable planets with colonist escaping Earth's destruction just prior to the obligatory atomic war. Fast forward 150 years and the crew of the starships routinely visit the colonies to barter raw materials for knowledge and technology. Suspicion and hostility mark the relationship between the starship dwellers with their closely held knowledge and the colonist scraping an existence on an alien planet without benefit of technology. This tense relationship is highlighted by the use of derogatory terms: "Grabbies" for the ship dwellers - since they are grabbing minerals and chemicals and "Mudeaters" for the colonist.With this as a background we are presented with a story told by Mia Havero, the daughter of one of the starships leaders, after she has completed her own rite of passage, also known as Trial. During this period all 14 year olds have to survive on a colonized planet for 30 days with a minimum of supplies. Suscessful completion of the trial bestows adult status on the individual. We are told of the fear and anxiety the teens experience, the lengthy preparations and the startling fact that not all candidates survive the trial. In Mia's group of 30 there were 12 that did not return. Without going into specific details - spoilers - this is a very concise plot summary.Having read this book twice I must admit that it does describe a thoughtful extrapolation of possible futures and a reasonably credible scheme for extra solar planetary colonization. My real problem has to do with the whole concept of the trial, which is in fact the crucial aspect of the book's plot. The entire idea just does not make common sense to this reader. Here we have a all-encompassing society of like minded individuals living in a starship - scientist, technicians, teachers, space pilots, doctors you name it, traveling thru space, visiting colony worlds seeded with their extended kin and how do they evaluate their children when the become 14 years old? Drop them off on one of these planets, one the teens have never visited and if they survive 30 days great, if not well too bad. Just what is the point? This is never adequately explained, I mean loosing 20 percent of your population to prove what? In fact nothing is explained - how did it this "trial" originated, did anyone object, what if someone is physically or mentally incapable of participating - what about them, can anyone refuse, do the other starships do the same thing, what if someone commits a crime during the trial - what then, and why the undercurrent of hostility towards the colonist, who, after all are refugees from Earth just like the starship dwellers. I just could not accept underlying concept of the "Rite of Passage".I do recommend the book since it does raise two controversial points that fans can cuss and discuss. One is the trial and the other is revealed at the very end of the book.

The fantasy-adventure novel "Silverlock", first published in 1949, by John Myers Myers (1906-1988) had a minor cult following among some elements of the professional science-fiction community.Based upon the glowing recommendations published in the Ace paperback I read this book much to my disappointment. At 516 pages I was anticipating an all-stops-pulled-out fantasy epic. Instead I was served up a convoluted and not very interesting tale full of literary references many of which were unfamiliar to me. Sometimes I felt like the author was making up "classics literature trivia quizzes" in lieu of a stronger narrative. If the author had included footnotes, a glossary or an appendix I might have found the book of more interest. I have subsequently noticed that the NESFA has published an annontated edition - I regret I did not a have that edition when I read the book, althought it is OOP and not inexpensive.If you like to decode literary puzzles by all means read this book. If you are a Literature major or enjoy deciphering arcane references to myths, legends and classics this is the book you have been pineing for. Otherwise I would recommend you pass this one up. The last paperback edition of this title was published in 1996 by Ace.Just an observation: since I posted this review - and rated it one star - I have received no "helpful" responses. I notice that the 4 and five star rated reviews show mostly "helpful" responses. I have well over 300 reviews on Amazon and notice the same trend - my 4 and 5 star reviews, in general, garner substantially more postive responses than my 2 and 1 star reviews. Just an observation.revised 1/3/2012 & 7/14/2012

The Art of Richard Powers - Jane FrankIn 1958 I read a book titled "Men, Martians and Machines" by Eric Frank Russell. I hardly recall the stories but the cover made a lasting impression on me. The depiction of bizarre alien machines, a fantastical space ship and a flaming sun influenced me to seek out and read more of these type stories. The cover artist was Richard Powers (1921-96) and his distinct style has graced numerous book covers over the period 1945 to 1997.I recently purchased The Art of Richard Powers first published in 2001. As a life long reader of science fiction and a Powers admirer I was delighted with this book. This book's large size: 9 by 11.5 - provides ample space to display many stunning examples of his otherworldly artwork in a generous format.At 128 pages the editor was able to include a wide selection of his painting. It was most interesting to see familiar book covers without the title over printing. Included is a checklist of all Powers book illustrations - my guess at least a thousand entries - from 1945 to 1997. The artwork is supplemented with several articles about and by Powers.

"Mayflower" - Nathaniel PhilbrickThe following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of "Mayflower " by Nathaniel Philbrick. George Guidall reads the book. This is a Penguin Audio edition.This listener found the narrator, George Guidall, an admirable speaker whose lucid pronunciation and reasonable pacing a pleasure to listen too.This audio book consist 11 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 12 and a half hours. The disks are secured in two standard fan fold multi CD holders. These two inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD to be played.For several years I did a significant amount of business travel. I filled those hours listening to numerous non-fiction audio books most of them in the history-biography category. Many were ok, some good and a very few compelling listening. " Mayflower " falls into the latter category. There are several reasons for this personal judgment. I found the subject matter very interesting to say the least. In addition the author has a brilliant knack for bringing to life historical events and personalities. Another factor, admittedly a personal one, is that I have lived near and visited many of the locations in Massachusetts detailed in this book.This book could of been titled "King Philip's War' since the narrative mostly concerns that sad and tragic event. This is not to say that the author shortchanges the reader concerning the Mayflower voyage and Plymouth Colony but the war is the climatic event in the book. That war is considered to be one of the bloodiest and costliest wars in the history of North America. More than half of New England's ninety towns were assaulted by Native American warriors and native losses are estimated to be 15% of the total population.I would highly recommed this book to anyone with an interest in the colonial period and Native American issues during thos years. The author quotes extensively from several eyewitness accounts which complements the story.I have a couple of comments related to this audio book. Whenever possible I recommed the unabridged version of an audio book if it is available. I am always concerned when a book is abridged - just what was left out in order to make it "fit" a specifed length. My edition of "Mayflower" was unabridged thankfully. My complaint about this audio book has to do with the chapter editing on the disks. The editors added chaper edit pauses corrosponding to thr length of time it took the narrator to read a chapter from the book. This made it difficult for me to find my location on a CD. Some editors add a pause on the disk every 3 minuets which makes finding your start point considerably easier. So now you know.

As a science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (1920-92) is noted primarily for his Robot novels and the Foundation series. The subject of these comments is the Bantam Audiocassette production of "Prelude to Foundation". This 1989 audio book consist of two audiocassettes with a length of 3 hours. The reader is David Dukes who does a commendable job when you consider he must alter his voice to represent about 12 characters. There is no mention if this production is an abridgement and if so did the author approve.For the record author Asimov wrote three "Foundation" novels is the early 1950's. I know I read one of the books in 1960's since I still have it on my shelf. (It was titled "The 1,000 Year Plan" with a note on the cover "former title Foundation".) Much later Asimov wrote four additional "Foundation" books in 1982, 1986, and 1988 and one published posthumously in 1993.The events detailed in "Prelude to Foundation" occurred prior to "Foundation" the first book in the series published in 1951. How Asimov kept all the characters, dates, events and ideas in sequence over 40 plus years is just another indication of what a genius this man was.

Two Hawks From Earth - The magical transposition of beings from our Earth to an alternative Earth is one of the standard plot ideas common in the universe of science-fiction novels. Authors usually employ some pseudo-scientific hocus-pocus to justify this highly improbable event. The hero muses about the "warp in the space time fabric" and temporary "time gates' opening or the old standby a "black hole eruption" to rationalize the experience. Clever authors soon have the heroes up to their neck in alligators and leeches. Musing about author's the crackpot speculations are soon forgotten and the plot rumbles or stumbles on.Phil Farmer, an author I hold in high esteem, wrote "Two Hawks' early in his career. Mr. Two Hawks, a WW2 bomber pilot, and his gunner are spirited to Earth 1 as they parachute from their disabled plane. Earth 1 is appreciably unlike in geography, evolution and technological development from our Earth. One aspect of the world that is identical is War. The story line then is fairly straightforward. Two Hawks, a military man from an advanced Earth, is hunted by the military intelligence services of the warring factions. His goal is to return to his "home" Earth. Farmer works with great diligence to keep this potboiler bubbling but, quite frankly, it is a story that has been told better by other writers.It is painfully apparent that Mr. Farmer spent many long hours researching continental drift theories, ancient migration patterns, language development and conjectures on racial development. Instead of padding his story with a few smart sounding observations we are given the whole load - pages and pages of esoteric theories and ideas. All this excessive "information" did was to turn a modestly interesting story into a very uninteresting one.If you have read Farmer's Riverworld" books you find the discussion in "Two Hawks from Earth" concerning air ships, there construction and use as a military weapon, familiar.In the forward to my 1985 Berkley edition Farmer tells us that he was very displeased when, in 1966, an editor changed the title to "The Gate of Time" and revised some of the dialog. Farmer had the intended title restored, dialog reset and added some addition words expanding the ending. Interested readers may want to read "The Gate of Time' which is available here, used, on Amazon.

Pirates attack a small family owner and operated merchant ship. Eventually everyone is killed or dies except for one person Sandor Kreja. With the help of recorded instructions and by hiring an occasional crewmember he remains in the merchant trade. Being a small ship he must sometimes take on hazardous cargo or run blockades with contraband. The ships papers and finances have been doctored and Sandor must keep one step ahead of inquisitive port inspectors and the military.During a brief layover in a foreign port he has a torrid affaire with an officer from a large merchant ship. He vows to meet her again in the next port. She shrugs off the affaire as just a pleasant one-night stand and returns to the comfort of her family owned and operated ship.Upon arrival in the next port Sandor is apprehended and interrogated about his questionable methods and procedures. His old flame intervenes with an offer to spring him from detention if he will partner with her and other members of her family.That is a summary of the plot. The author adds "spaceships" before merchant and the ports are on planets but this old warhorse of a plot has been run into the ground many times in the historical fiction genre.Plowing through this book was tedious to say the least. The characters are unexciting and uninspiring and the plot, such as it is, flows like molasses in winter.

"Andrew Jackson - His Life and Times" - H.W. BrandsThe following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "Andrew Jackson - His Life and Times" by H.W. Brands. Chuck Montgomery reads the book. This is a Random House Audio edition.This listener found the narrator, Chuck Montgomery, an excellent speaker whose clear pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too. Mr. Montgomery has, in this reviewer's opinion, an appealing Southern tone to his diction that complements the subject matter.This audio book consist 7 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 8 hours. The disks are secured in two standard fan fold multi CD holders. These two inserts slide into the external packaging box. Each CD holder has identification on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this because not all audio book manufactures add this helpful numbering feature.For several years I did a significant amount of business travel. I filled those hours listening to numerous non-fiction audio books most of them in the history-biography category. Many were ok, some good and very few compelling listening. "Andrew Jackson" falls into the latter category. There are two reasons for this personal judgment. The subject matter just crackles with exciting events and dramatic situations. In addition the author has a brilliant knack for bringing to life historical events and personalities. This authors talent was also evident in another audio book I have experienced, "Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt".I will not even attempt to summaries the numerous actions and personalities covered in this book. The author does a more that creditable job of keeping his focus on Jackson. He does divert to elaborate upon the events and controversies of the times - just enough to make you want to follow up on, say, Sam Houston, Texas Independence, Aaron Burr, Indian Wars in Florida and other topics that kindled my interest.My readings in American History have been confined, primarily, to the Revolutionary and Civil War Periods. I found the subject matter very informative and useful in what transpired between those two events.Look for author Brands history lectures on YouTube. I found them most interesting and informative.

This book documents the last few chaotic weeks of the US presents in Vietnam. The human story is effectively conveyed by first hand accounts of eyewitnesses from many strata of Vietnam society. The author, an NBC reporter in Saigon, witnessed these events firsthand. His unique perspective and access to the diplomatic corps adds a fascinating credibility to the book. His discussion concerning the actions and statements of Ambassador Graham Martin particularly intrigued me. Did Martin's decisions during that period contribute to the frantic last minute evacuation that left many friendlies stranded? The author makes no judgments. Butler includes transcript of many diplomatic cables to and from Martin and Secretary of State Kissinger and the White House concerning events and plans for evacuation and rescue. Reading these transcripts today still convevs a strong emotional impact for this reader. Interspacing these high level discussions are the stories of a whole society turned upside down while "we" skipped town.The Fall of Saigon is not an easy book to read. We are forced to confront the final conclusion of our failed crusade. Our goal was the minds and the hearts but we ended up fragmented the lives of the people we were suppose to help. When one considers the sacrifices made by both countries in treasure and lives the facts concerning the events of April-May 1975 are hard to digest, even after 30 plus years. No judgments are made here, no accusing fingers are pointed; we must read, and ponder.

"My FBI by Louis J. FreehThe following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "My FBI" by Louis J. Freeh. Adam Grupper reads the book.Louis B. Freeh was the director of the FBI - Federal Bureau of Investigation - from September 1993 to June 2001. He was appointed by President Bill Clinton and served into the first George W. Bush administration.Mr. Freeh began his career as an FBI agent and later was an assistant US Attorney and a US district court judge prior to being appointed the 10th director of the FBI.On the plus side I found the discussions of several high profile cases - Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, Kobar Towers bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing - to name a few - compelling listening.Mr. Freeh, now retired, used this book to defend the FBI and his record as Director. I have no problem with this, it is almost a given that anyone is such a highly visible government position would be subject to critics and should defend himself. The reader/listener must decide on the validity of his claims. It is apparent that his most strenuous critism is reserved for the perceived indifference and lack of support from the Clinton Administration and Congress.For individuals, like myself, who do not have a more that superficial knowledge of the events that transpired and the players involved this was a very useful and informative audio book. Nonetheless be warned it is opinionated and slanted towards the Republican POV.This audio book consist 5 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 6 and one-half hours. Audio Adventures Landmark Audiobooks published the audio book.The disks are secured in the standard fan fold multi CD holder. The holder slides into the external packaging box.Each CD is indexed into approximately 12 segments. I found this very helpful finding my place on a disk or finding a particular segment to play again.

Tuxedo Park by Jennet Conant"Tuxedo Park' is a biography of Alfred Lee Loomis (1887-1975). Mr. Loomis was rich, well connected, attended the right schools, Phillips and Harvard, and had a friend in a high place who opened doors - first cousin of Henry Stimson - who served twice served as Secretary of War 1911-1913 under Republican William Howard Taft and 1940-1945, under Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt.Mr. Loomis was no parasitic playboy; he became an acknowledged financial wizard on Wall Street and could of spent his entire career in the world of high finance. After making his millions he "retired" at an early age and devoted himself to his true love; he was obsessed with a curiosity about things scientific. He was not an eccentric fiddling with outlandish experiments but used his wealth and connections to became directly involved with numerous scientific inquires and discoveries. Some of his interest had direct military applications that were instrumental in the allies' victory during WW2 - radar and the atomic bomb. His vast estate at Tuxedo Park, New York, approximately 40 miles NW of New York City, became a Mecca for the scientific elite. Loomis sponsored seminars, lectures and built labs for the up and coming scientist recruited from MIT.This book is a detailed biography of Alfred Loomis. He led a fascinating life, made significant contributions to our scientific knowledge and Ms Conant has done a credible job making his life story an enjoyable and educational reading experience.A note to potential readers: I found this book a challenge to read. I do not have a deep knowledge of science nor was I farmiliar with the scientist discussed. Nonetheless I learned about subjects I was unfamiliar with and was introduced to some gifted and talented individuals.

"To Your Scattered Bodies Go" presents the reader with a gripping concept: what if superior beings were able to bring back to life every single human being that ever lived. All these folks would then be restored to full health and vigor, with all there past memories intact. The`re-born" would populate throughout a valley along an immensely long river. To add to the pandemonium sure to result no justification or explanation is given for this mass resurrection. Farmer to his credit is able to get his hands around this topic by using historical individuals as central characters. The interaction between the explorer Richard Burton and the infamous Nazi Hermann Goering, not only propels the narrative but also provides intriguing commentary on the nature of humankind.This novel by Phil Farmer is the first book of five in the Riverworld series. Farmer salts this unusual tale with a number of tantalizing unanswered plot turns and apparent dead-ends. Nonetheless this novel can stand-alone and does not require the reading of the remaining volumes to be enjoyed.It may be of interest to some readers to know that this is not the first time that author Farmer has written about a mass human resurrection. The book Inside, Outside, not part of the Riverworld series, explored the same concept from a decidedly different perspective.

"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" by Edmund MorrisThe following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt " by Edmund Morris. Harry Chase reads the book. Random House Audio markets this item. It should be noted that "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" in the first of three volumes in author Morris's biography of President Theodore Roosevelt.This listener found the narrator, Harry Chase, a distraction.

The disks are secured in two standard cardboard multi CD holders. These two inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD.

This audio book provided this listener with many hours of entertainment and education.

Before The Storm - Rick PerlsteinBefore The Storm by Rick Perlstein is a hefty dose of political facts and trivia concerning the reluctant rise of Barry Goldwater as the republican presidential nominee in 1964. My trade paperback edition totals 671 pages of closed spaced text, notes, references and an index; 8 pages of photos are included but are not counted as pages.Having read Perlstein's "Nixonland" I knew what to expect - lots of details concerning many individuals and organizations that sometimes propel and sometimes thwart those who aspired to political office.I am a student of the 60's and have read numerous non-fiction titles concerning Vietnam, Kennedy-Johnson and the cultural wars. This book had great appeal for me and I found many things to admire. I learned many aspects of how the Republican Party evolved and the rise of the "New Right" in the late 50's and early 60's. Be forewarned author Perlstein has done his research and he shares lots of details. This is not a "quick read" and this book may put off individuals not familiar with some of the issues or personalities discussed. Nonetheless this is an important book and is worth one's effort to, if necessary, plow through it.Political books cause many folks to become very suspicious of a hidden agenda or bias on the part of the author. I am not convinced that this author set out to ridicule or disparage Goldwater, and those that agreed with him. I found this neutrality true of "Nixonland" also. I hold this opinion because of the extensive quotes and notes that provide a solid basis of fact. Frankly I would not waste my time reading, "hatched jobs" nor would I recommend them to others.I have a personal interest in the topic of this book since in 1964 I voted in my first Presidential election. During the campaign I was on active duty and was very aware of the potential for a showdown in Vietnam. Barry Goldwater just could not get any traction on this issue with Johnson. I recalled Goldwater had a large cadre of very committed supporters but was pilloried in the popular press for his, then, far right ideas.Contrary to what some folk may believe most soldiers would prefer not to fight in a war, but we are committed to serve if required. Lyndon Johnson made the following public statement immediately prior to the election on November 5, 1964:We are not about to send American boys nine or ten thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."--Campaign address, Oct. 21, 1964"There is and will be, as long as I am president, peace for all Americans."--Oct. 27, 1964"The only real issue in this campaign, the only one you ought to be concerned about, is who can best keep the peace."--Oct. 28, 1964Barry Goldwater made a few statements that made him appear a warmonger and sometimes nuttier than a fruitcake nonetheless he had a charismatic appeal and I admired him. I voted for Johnson and he lied and then lied some more concerning plans to escalate in Vietnam. This has been fully documented in many books and is touched upon in "Before The Storm".

In this novel the reader is introduced to newly minted Ensign Flandry, age nineteen, fresh out of the Space Navy Academy, full of patriotism for the Empire and equally full of skepticism for efforts at detent with the Evil Empire- The Merseian.Once we digest the apparent similarities with Horatio Hornblower, push aside the cardboard characters - appealing natives, reptilian enemies and incompetent leaders, accept the E. E. Smith space antics we are left with a story, not profound or rich in ideas, but with enough adventure to keep the pages turning.Our saga concerns Terra and the Merseian who each support opposing factions in a civil war on the planet Starket. The conundrum for the Flandry and the Space navy forces is why does the Merseians continue to escalate the conflict risking a catastrophic war with Terra. You will have to read the book to find the answer.Light and enjoyable entertainment for fans of Poul Anderson.

Author Silverberg presents the reader with a puzzling conundrum for our rumination: an alien race build a 100 square mile maze around their only "city"; loads it with lethal hazards and deadly illusions and leave no explanation as to the reason for it's existence or how it continues to maintain itself eons after the creators have perished.The author provides no answer, and I suppose none are necessary. The ambiguity hangs over the story and perhaps provides a mysterious ambiance.I was disappointed with this book. I was fascinated by the concept of the ancient maze and expected the story would resolve the mysteries of its origin. Instead we are presented with a fairly routine SF novel with unremarkable characters and a dollop of "super-science nonsense". The plot tells of a man isolated in the maze and how he is induced, by trickery, to leave and serve a greater good.

"Rocket Ship Galileo" is a young adult novel published in 1947 by the esteemed science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlein. My Ace 2005 trade paperback edition features a marvelous "retro" cover illustration reminiscent of 1950's Astounding or Amazing magazines - the artist was Tristan Elwell.Through the haze of time and way too many SF books I recall reading this title in the early 50's. I should of left well enough alone. Tell me now, weren't all those books you read in your early teens just terrific and fondly remembered. Just don't go back and re-read any of them!To say that this book is "dated" is an understatement. I had to keep reminding myself that, after all, in 1947 rockets powered with nuclear energy, nerdy teenagers building an actual space ship, and Nazi fanatics hiding out on the Moon plotting revenge were "hot" ideas and would of resonated with science-fiction readers of the period.Heinlein fans are legion and they should read at least a few of his early juveniles just to appreciate his talents at the beginning of his career and how they matured in later years.

As a long-term reader of science fiction and an admirer of the writings of Avram Davidson the publication of this particular book was, for me, a noteworthy event. I was able to renew my acquaintance with some of the delightful stories I had first read ten to twenty-five years ago. Each story is preceded by a thoughtful introduction by author friends of the late Mr. Davidson. I found these short essays generally very helpful since most of the writers maintained a correspondence with AD and could provide personal insights and biographical data related to the stories.The 38 stories are grouped chronologically by the decade in which they were published; Fifties to Nineties. I noticed that the excellent Ray Bradbury afterward had been used as an introduction to another out-of-print AD collection, Strange Seas and Shores, Doubleday, 1971.My only grouse is that I wish the editors had included a listing of the titles of AD books, novels and short story collections. Thank you editors Silverberg and Davis, a beautiful book and a fitting tribute to "one of the finest short story writers ever to use the English language"...Robert Silverberg.

I have read many of Dick's novels and can say with some confidence that this is not the one I would recommend to new readers. It contains narrative themes that I find engaging and challenging but also exhibits Dick's tendency to wander into muddled plot entanglements that could put you into a coma.The story has our obsessed protagonist Jack Hamilton fired from a California defense research lab because of a suspicion that his wife is a Red. Soon after he is on a tour to witness the first test of a "Proton Beam Deflector" and, well, something goes dreadfully wrong - welcome to alternate universes and a creepy vision of God's eye.1950's McCarthy-era paranoia is believable especially if you spouse is working in defense, but giving tours of an experimental radiation accelerator during first turn-on is just a characteristically implausible Dick plot contrivance.The authors descriptions of the God encounters in this novel are hilarious and sometimes very, very weird. It is a theme explored in greater depth in several of his later works. As only Dick could tell us: "Nobert Wiener," Tillingford said. "You recall his works in cybernetics. And even more important, Enrico Destini's work in the field of theophonics." What's that Hamilton asked?" Tillingford raised an eyebrow...Communications between man and God, of course...Destini was able to set up the really adequate system of communication between earth and heaven in 1946." Later a brilliant passage has Hamilton praying to God for his $400 pay and bucket of change rains down upon him. Seems God pay off in coin not currency. This event occurs soon after Hamilton and a friend ascended to heaven on a holy umbrella only to find a gigantic eye.Eye In The Sky was first published by Ace in 1957. It was the fifth novel by Dick published by Ace in a two-year span. I found the story so untypical of the Ace "space opera" line published in the 50's I was mildly surprised they issued it. But published it they did and it was reprinted by Ace several times with new cover art no less.

"I have no morbid fear of death, nor any sentimental wish to gain the brief immortality that a thought accorded me after I am dead may give me, for the thought itself will be a fleeting one and the one who holds it himself will not have too many years of life, for the years of man are short...far too short for any perfect understanding of any of the problems a lifetime poses." from "Time and Again"To be honest if you told me this story concerned a space traveler in the 80th century returning to Earth after 20 years from a mysterious 'closed" star system it would not particularly entice me to rush out and purchase a copy - if one were available that is. To compound my reluctances I'm informed that the author include a caboodle of props, conventions, and terminology - robots, time travel, and aliens - in order to be published under the "science-fiction" banner. It is remarkable that Simak could employe these inane plot elements to create a startling entertaining story with some poignant metaphysical ruminations. Then again, Simak was a dedicated craftsman laboring in a field with an overabundance of hacks. His "real" career was as a journalist, which could only help his narrative skills.There is more to this story that meets the eye. It is apparent to this reader that Simak had some strongly held personal ideas he wished to share with an audience but not in a newspaper article. Asher Sutton returning from his mission to 61 Cygni where he died. He returns in spacecraft that is inoperable, has no air or food. He is obsessed with writing a book that will change the course of human history. Take the name of the protagonist Asher Sutton. In rabbinical literature "Asher" is regarded as the example of a virtuous man who with singlemindedness strives only for the general good. Talking to an old eithics professor friend he, Asher, ask: "Have you ever felt," asked Sutton, "as if you sat on God's right hand and heard a thing that you knew you were never meant to hear?" Interesting ruminations for a 1950's SF novel I'll say.A character, a relative of Asher, ruminated on death:"I have no morbid fear of death, nor any sentimental wish to gain the brief immortality that a thought accorded me after I am dead may give me, for the thought itself will be a fleeting one and the one who holds it himself will not have too many years of life, for the years of man are shot...far too shot for any perfect understanding of any of the problems a lifetime poses."Asher mediated on nature:"The water was warm against his body and it talked to him with a deep, important voice and Sutton thought, it is trying to tell me something, as it has tried to tell the people something all down through the ages. A might tongue talking down the land, gossiping to itself when there is no one else to hear, but trying, always trying to tell its people the news it has to tell. Some of them, perhaps, have grasped a certain truth and a certain philosophy from the river, but none of them have ever reached the meaning of the river's language, for it is an unknown language."This book is highly recommended - possibly Simak's best, or al least one of his best.Clifford D. Simak (1904-88) wrote 26 science-fiction novels of which "Time and Again" was his second, published in 1951. For some unknown reason it's first paperback publication was titled "First He Died"- Dell 1953. All subsequent editions were titled "Time and Again" with the last publication being in 1993.

I have usually found books about authors, their background and personal thoughts concerning their writings very helpful and a positive supplement to my readings of their works. This book is no exception - a handsome, concise and beautifully illustrated guide to the C.S. Lewis land of Narnia.Although published in 2005 as a movie tie-in book with the release of Disney's "The Lion, Which and the Wardrobe" it is chock full of fascinating information on all seven Narnia books and C.S. Lewis.This publication is not a detailed biography of Lewis or a theological analysis of the Narnia books. It is an excellent overview of the stories, characters and themes of Narnia with an abundance of excellent illustrations and drawing from previous editionsof the novels. The large format of the book allows the full impact of the artwork to be appreciated.Highly recommended for all readers and as a bonus available used at a low price.

This novel presents the reader with a brutal and realistic perspective of the war in Viet Nam. I have read many non-fiction books about various aspects of the war and cannot fault the authors as to terminology, tactics and politics. Utilizing the run up to the Tet offensive we are swept along with an NVA/Viet Cong unit as they single mindedly prepare for the final battle to destroy the Americans and over through the corrupt SVN regime.The authors keep this reader up late turning pages. His method of alternating each chapter from the American and the NVA/Viet Cong perspective was very effective in building excitement and narrative tension.In the final analysis I must confess that yes, this is an exciting, realistic novel but it was also very depressing. The carnage that rained down on the people of SVN by both sides for very murky motives left me thinking what a waste to achieve such intangible goals.

Science fiction author Robert Silverberg has made time travel the central subject matter in several of his novels. Including the book under discussion "Up the Line" (1969) I know of three others - they may be more - "Time Hoppers" (1967), "Hawksbill Station" (1970) and "Project Pendulum" (1987). To his credit the very talented Mr. Silverberg has been able to infuse this overused theme with enough unique perspectives and narrative curiosities to craft interesting, and, perhaps even perceptive views of the past and the future.Mr. Silverberg in addition to his extensive science-fiction body of works has written numerous non-fiction books on the subjects of Ancient History, the Crusades, and Eurasian Archaeology. This background is put to good use since our protagonist is a student of Byzantine culture and history and a substantial amount of historical data - emperors, battles, historical locations and culture are imparted during the story narrative."Up the Line" chronicles the travels and misadventures of Jud Elliott a Time Courier -an individual who takes tourist on historical tours of key events, in Jud's tours Byzantine history. Silverberg does something very interesting in this time travel story - he makes a valiant attempt to address the inherent contradictions of time travel. How well he succeeds is a judgment reserved for each reader. First he set out the rules: you can travel back in time but not forward; commercial time travel tours to view historical periods and events are available from licensed and trained Time Courier and if any "problems" take place "up the line" there is a Time Patrol ready to intervene and "correct" any temporal displacements. For example what if you go back in time and tamper with an historical event or erase one of your ancestors - intentionally or unintentionally.In "Up the Line" our dedicated Courier Jud succumbs to his randy impulses and falls afoul of the "Paradoxs of Temporal Accumulation" and that of "Transit Displacement" both of which are thankfully fully described in the text.

Vance is in top form as he creates a society evolved from shipwrecked misfits and malcontents on a world covered entirely with oceans. Enormous floating vegetation pads provide living space. After ten generations the writings of the founders are subject of scholarly debate; all subsistence is from the sea; work is apportioned via guides; and a huge Kraken is worshipped by some and ignored by others.On the stage steps Sklar Hast-a fine Vance name-who questions Kraken worship and the priesthood evolved to lead the ceremonies. Hast devises a method for capturing and killing the beast that elates one segment of the society and infuriates the remainder. The priest claim that King Kraken will destroy the floating pads if not placated with food offering. Sklar maintains man should not be subject to the beast. Eventually Sklar and his followers split from the Kraken worshippers and sets off to form a new community. The books strength is in its rationalization of a viable society wholly dependent on aquatic materials and a it's captivating story line.The Blue World first appeared as a short story in Fantastic Magazine in 1964, Ballantine edition published in April 1977.

Don't by put off by the inflammatory title of this book. Some potential readers may assume this is just another left leaning author taking a swipe at Nixon. In fact it is a well-researched look at a 1950's senatorial race between two individuals from diametrically opposite ends of the political spectrum.In truth Nixon did used almost every "trick" in the playbook to win the election and consequently further his political career. The author lays it out chapter and verse.A bibliography, notes and an index make this a most useful volume for general readers and students interested in Richard Nixon's rise to power.

Swords & Deviltry is the first of a series books chronicling the adventures of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser. It is not a novel, but rather three connected stories.The first "The Snow Women" tells of what prompts Fafhrd's abrupt departure from the cold northern wastes in order to seek a new life in the believed civilized lands. His escape is aided with the help of the woman he had come to love."The Unholy Grail" tells of the first adventures of the Grey Mouser, his victory over his lover's evil father and the origins of his name.A Nebula was awarded to the third story "Ill met in Lankhmar" and recounts the first meeting between the two heroes.While the first two stories are good, it is only when our heroes meet that the magic really begins. Leiber is an excellent writer and the Swords series featuring Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser are among the best of the genre.

Gordon R. Dickson (1923-2001) was a prolific science fiction author producing novels from the 1950's to his untimely death in 2001.I approached his 1973 novel "The R-Masters" with some trepidation. My bookshelf has 11 of his novels all of which could be broadly classified as "space adventures/space-operas". The "R-Master" setting is earth in the not too distant future and the characters never travel beyond the atmosphere. I was pleased to find that I was entertained by this thoughtful story from first to last page.I have a suspicion that Dickson had a personal point he wanted to make with this story but I have no confirmation - so I'll leave it at that. To some well meaning folks the ideal is for humankind to evolve into a utopia ruled over by a benevolent World Government. Every one would be provided a stipend consisting of food and shelter credits and free health care. There would be no cause for disaffection. Well, author Dickson is none too happy with this arrangement and writes an entertaining and thoughtful rebuttal. He used the effects of a mind-stimulating drug, R-47, as the basis for his rebellion against the World Economic Council. Along the way we are introduced to a group of very interesting characters and some quirky plot twists. Recommended, especially if, like myself, you had only experience Dickson as a award winning author of outer space stories.In November 1973 J.B. Lippincott first published this title in hardbound. In 1984 an expanded and revised edition was published in paperback by TOR books under the title "The Last Master". Significantly the page count from the hardbound edition to the revised paperback jumped from 216 to 318 pages. According to a note in the ISFDB (Internet Science-Fiction Data Base) the book "The Last Master" did not stated it was an expanded version of "The R-Master". Since I have not read "The Last Master" I cannot expound on the revisions but note it here for anyone interested in this title, it's publishing history and a greatly expanded version of the story.

The British author John Brunner (1934-95) was a fine writer that never short changed his readers even when he was cranking out space operas like The Avengers of Carrig/Secret Agents of Terra. His characters have depth and substance; alien environments are described in a sensible and believable manner; plot events are unexpectedly dramatic and logically propel the action.For the record in 1962 Ace published one of John Brunner's first novels title "Secret Agent of Terra" subtitled "Vultures from the A-Power Orbit". The cover featured a shapely woman in a skin tight space suit. Using lurid titles and a sexy or horror themed cover art was typical of 50's and 60's Ace marketing for their low budget SF line. Surprisingly many excellent novels were first published in these Ace editions and are highly desired by collectors. This book was part of an Ace Double and was 126 pages in length. In 1969 Dell published an expanded version of "Secret Agents of Terra" re-titled as "The Avengers of Carrig" at 157 pages. The cheesy cover and silly subtitle was replaced and the length was bulked up 31 pages. I have read both versions and prefer "Avengers" although it has, in my estimation, one of the worst covers ever slapped on a SF paperback.Unfortunately you will be hard pressed to find any of Brunner's 60 novels for sale in a bookstore. The sad fact is that none of his books have been reprinted in the last ten years. If you enjoy a well-written science fiction stories featuring "adventures on alien planets" seek out the early Brunner titles such as "Avengers of Carrig" on the used book market.

Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951) was an English author noted for the remarkable number of "weird fiction" stories that he wrote.I sought out this particular collection based upon H. P. Lovecraft's comment that Blackwood was perhaps the greatest weird fiction writer of his day and "Incredible Adventures" as among his finest works.According to Wikipedia Blackwood was a member of one of the factions of the qabbalistic Orders, the Hermetic Order of the Golden dawn. This accounts for the almost obsessive focus on religious themes and inner spiritual struggles in the stories.This reader found all the stories interesting up to a point. As an adjunct to reading Lovecraft they were helpful. I must say honestly I am not motivated to read any addition works by this author.Blackwood certainly has a way with language and an ability to express his ideas. In "The Damned" he describes an intolerant religious figure:"his voice was alternately hard and unctuous; he regarded theatres, ballrooms and race-courses as the vestibule of that brimstone lake of whose geography he was positive as of his great office in the city".The five stories in this collection were first published in 1914.The Hippocampus Press trade paperback edition includes a helpful introduction by S. T. Joshi.

"Earth wanted to get rid of him, perhaps afraid of him, perhaps merely disgusted by him, a loathsome product of its own ambitions and imagination that must be quickly swept under the rug. For there was no place for him on the Earth or in humanity, and yet he was a human product and had been made possible by the nimble brains and the weasel understanding of Earth's scientist." from "The Werewolf Principle"The "Werewolf Principle" is a thoughtful and entertaining science fiction novel. The time is 200 years from the present and mankind has achieved faster-that-light space travel, is exploring other star system and finding a verity of intelligent life forms. A derelict space capsule contained a man with no identity and no memory is discovered drifting through space.The rescued man, Andrew Blake, as he in named, has a complicated past and some incredible unearthly talents. Approximately 200 years ago "Blake" was part of an experiment to create an artificial human that could not only travel to the distance reaches of the universe but could mentally assimilate alien intelligences. The project was called the "Werewolf Principle". Since neither of the two experimental explorers ever returned the project was buried and forgotten in the archives by the Space Agency. Blake has the ability to transform into one of two alien beings - an energy absorbing pyramid or a wolf like alien both companions are "intelligent". The plot revolves around Blake's quest to discover his true identity and destiny.It should be no surprise to readers of Simak's novels that a high esteem for the natural world and a distain for metropolitan sprawl is a theme in this story. Another recognizable topic is the use of a rural-loving extraterrestrials - Brownies - as a agent for unenthusiastic observations on mankind's urbanization.The "Werewolf Principle"[1987] is the third science fiction novel by Clifford D. Simak [1904-88] that uses a similar theme: that of mankind's achieving dramatic intellectual growth by merging mentally with an entity[s] from a distant solar system. The other two are "Time and Again" [1951] and "Time is the Simplest Thing" [1961].

Andre Norton - The Stars are Ours!First published in hardbound in 1954 "The Stars Are Ours!' is an above average science-fiction adventure story. Many of Norton's standard motifs are on display in this story: a resourceful unskilled orphan boy, a precocious young girl with an extraordinary empathy with "cute" animals and alien children, a confrontation with a society in turmoil and mysteries abounding on an alien planet.Norton opens this book with a very informative excerpt from the "Encyclopedia Galactica". We are informed of the origins of the anti-technology "Company of Pax" rulers of a post apocalypse Earth. In order to consolidate their rule the Pax militia, the Peacemen, conduct pogroms aimed at exterminating the Free Scientist - the group blamed for developing atomic weapons, which brought on the apocalypse. With this helpful background the author can rush the reader along the twist and turns of the plot without digressing to "explain" the back-story.The novel consists of two sections. Part one-detailed efforts by the wily Free Scientist to expedite the building and launching a starship before the relentless Peacemen close in on their secret mountain hideaway. This part of the book was least satisfying for this reader. It mostly consisted of several extended chases across winter landscapes resulting in our protagonist making a frosty "miracle" last minute escape from the clutches of the stereotyped bad guys The Peacemen. The section ends with the Free Scientist in a suspended animation state blasting off for a new home among the stars.The second part of the book details the last stages of the starships journey; the selection and exploration of a new planet and details of the quite interesting discoveries on the planet Astra. Ms Norton's scientifically accurate descriptions of planetary conditions necessary to support humans, the initial exploration of an alien ecology and the keen sense of discovery is classic 1950's science fiction story telling at it's best.Many of Norton's novels have sequels and this novel is no exception. "Star Born" first published in 1957 continues the story of the pioneering scientist and their adventures on a new world. It is not necessary to read "The Stars Are Ours" first, but you should - if you can.I will be the first to admit these are not easy books to find. You can only obtain them in used editions on the Internet. Readers with an interest in Andre Norton and/or 1950's space adventures will, I believe enjoy this book - I did.

We are informed that "Dead Man's Walk" by Larry McMurtry is the initial adventures of Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call of "Lonesome Dove" fame. Having not read "Lonesome Dove" I felt that this was the book I should read first. Yes, I have seen the movie so I had some knowledge of the characters, the era and some the incidents that would transpire in their collective future.The book tells of the ghastly and horrific mis-adventures by the very young Texas Rangers Gus and Call as they are led by the incompetent Major Randall Chevallie and then by the doomed to failure land pirate Caleb Cobb.I was significantly intrigued by many aspects of this book: the author's ability to created numerous characters who could be equally strange, frightening and astonishing, his almost photographic depiction just how hazardous survival was out on the open range with it's natural danger and the nuanced depiction of the Comanche's particularly Buffalo Hump and Kicking Wolf.There are many aspects of this story that I found grim and depressing but nonetheless I maintain it provides a realistic depiction of just how difficult it was for dispossessed individuals to endure during that period and in that location. I look forward with anticipation to reading the other three books that chronicle the adventures of Gus and Call.

Mastodonia by Clifford D. Simak"Mastodonia" to be charitable, may have been intended as a spoof of time-travel stories. There are many characters in the tale with questionable motives that seem more generic of a type. A big game safari outfit wants to escort the well-heeled gentry way back in time to blast away at the dinosaurs. We have the fundamentalist Christian minister who greatly desires preventing any travel during the period when Christ was alive - after all who knows what might be discovered. A farm state Senator want to send all the folks on welfare back in time to be, well, farmers - even if they would prefer otherwise. The CIA wants to snoop around but the reason why is not revealed. Another individual want to grab Inca gold presumable before the Spanish do. Hollywood want a movie and, no to be left out of the pillage, the heroine want to go to South Africa and pick up some diamonds.I take a muted view of these types of stories precisely because of the shear impossibility of the traveling throught time. Nonetheless as a long time reader of science fiction I have had occasion to read a number of similar themed stories. The few that at least speak to the absurdity of tampering with the past, or ruminate on the elaborate steps taken to prevent any timeways miscues are mildly entertaining.(see "Up The Line" by Robert Silverberg for example) In this story aside from a few musings by the hero -"gee I hope we don't mess with anything" this is a dead issue. Frankly, I was surprised that such a perceptive and talented writer would blow-off this crucial point. For example there is an episode in the story were a safari to the past is completely wiped out by dinosaurs. Now I ask you if these individuals were "killed" millions of years ago how could they have been "alive" in our time since they were already, well, dead! Aside from some concern about bad publicity or ever a lawsuit there is absolute no mention of this apparent contradiction.The fact that after it's initial publication in 1978 this title has never been reprinted in the U.S. speaks volumes to its lack of popularity.On a positive note: I am a sincere admirer of this author and there is one section in this book that I greatly enjoyed. It concerns the first journey taken into the past. Simak's scientific knowledge and narrative skills are on full display in these exciting pages.

These comments are for the Dove Audio book of "In Retrospect" by Robert S. McNamara (1916-2009). This audio book consists of 4 audiocassettes and playtime is 6 hours. Joseph Campanella reads the book with a preface by McNamara. Mr. Campanella does a credible job reading but I could only wish the author read his own material. I have heard McNamara speak several times and he would on done a much better job in my estimation.As Secretary of Defense in the Kenney and Johnson administration McNamara played a pivotal role in implementing and influencing Viet Nam policy. This book is well worth reading or listening too just to obtain McNamara's perspective of this turbulent period. Some historians may counter his conclusions and decisions but that does not diminish the value this book provides to students of the War.As a Viet-Nam era serviceman with an interest in military history I have acquired and read approximately 130 books related to that conflict in South East Asia. If asked to recommend three books to new students interested in the VN War all would be either by or related to Robert McNamara. In addition to this title the other two are "The Living and The Dead" by Paul Hendrickson and "Dereliction of Duty" by H.R. McMasters. Certainly there is considerably more to the War that McNamara's participation. Nonetheless his long tenure as Secretary of Defense, 1961-8, cast a long shadow over many divisive aspects of the conflict making this book is a very helpful introduction to the era.

Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan in SessionAlbert King (1923-92) and Stevie Ray Vaughan (1960-90) recorded this live CD on December 6, 1983 in Hamilton Ontario. The story of how this came about is detailed in the ample notes that accompany the disk.The collaboration of the blues icon Albert King and the Texas blues star Stevie Ray Vaughan will provide the fans of each a thoughtful and enjoyable listening experience.One of the real pleasures of this CD is the banter between songs. Listening to King and Vaughan joke, tease and talk blues was a unexpected extra.Oh yes, what about the music, well expect to get your sox's blown off. A worthy addition to your music library.

Jefferson Airplane Loves YouThis 3 CD set features 51 song by the band Jefferson Airplane recorded during the period 1965-1972.For many individuals with an interest in popular music of the era this collection can be considered an historical curiosity, a cultural relic or a gold mine. "So this is what granny and grandpa use to listed too long, long ago," mused our off spring.I was a teen when the Airplane was at peak popularity and still possess some of their earlier vinyl albums. Admittedly it has been decades since I listened to them. Playing this 3 CD collection reminded me just how talented this band was.Grace Slick had a great voice for rock but she rarely had an opportunity to exercise her magnificent pipes, what a shame.Yes, the old warhorse hits are here but no live versions except for "White Rabbit". On CD-1 are nine songs recorded live, May 1967, at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco. Talk about historical curiosity and cultural relics!Overall this is a worthy addition to your musical collection - if you are interest in a broad selection of this band's recordings. For many a "Greatest Hits" CD will do just fine.

This large format book - suitable for your coffee table - fully satisfies all the requirements of its title " History of North American Railroads". The editor details the development of railroads in both the United States and Canada. I was farmiliar with the hardships involved in expanding train service from coast to coast in the States but the Canadian story was something else. The geological and weather related obstacles that challenged the rail expansion across the American West were compounded in Canada. That story deserves a lavish book to itself.Speaking of lavish, the generous quantity of full and double page color and period black and white photographs are breathtaking. For the curious and especially the train fan this is a worth book to own.

Destiny Doll - Clifford D. SimakClifford D. Simak [1904-88] wrote 26 novels in his career all of which have been out of print for many years. My goal has been to first acquire all his novels - a challenge in it's self; read them naturally; and then post a few subjective comments here on Amazon for anyone who may care to know about the book and what a long time reader of science-fiction thought of it. With "Destiny Doll" I have read my 20th Simak novel. Just as an aside I note certain reoccurring themes and author ruminations in his books and sometimes share them in these amateur jottings. Some of his themes are quite profound but, we readers must not to loose sight of the fact that Mr. Simak was a writer, who understandably wanted to sell lots of books to as large an audience as possible so could not pontificated to any great extend without alienating or confusing some of his fan base. Nonetheless in "Destiny Doll" (1971) Simak veers into a story brimming with inscrutable characters, enigmatic events and lots of mysticism most of which is left up to the reader to decode. No wonder it was last printed in 1982 and there have only been a few editions. I loved the book but would be reluctant to push it on new readers.Simak novels usually follow the formula of assembling a band of improbable characters, persuade them to proceed on a bizarre quest with uncertain goals and then relate how the whole muddle somehow gets itself resolved.Our crew consist of a wealthy huntress married to her rifle that is her constant companion, a down and out space ship pilot who is possible the most cynical character ever to grace a science-fiction novel, a blind mystic that hears voices and a wimpy monk that leads the blind man. The huntress is convinced that the blind mystic can guide them to the mother-load of planetary fortune and will pay whatever required for the pilot to use the mystic as a kind of spiritual navigator. Our pilot, Mike Ross, tells them they are all crazy but for money he will do almost anything. We quickly shift to the strangest planet you could possible conceive of. A beam of some sort of guides the ship to a large, white, seamless spaceport. Our crew is greeted by several "hobbies" like in hobbyhorses that talk and rock back and forth. Seems something awful will happen very soon so gather up your gear, say the hobbies, and lets hightail it for the city. The city consists of massive white building apparently uninhabited by all appearances. With some reluctance the crew agrees. As they exit the spaceport a mechanism completely coats and seals the ship with what appears to be the same white material used to build the port and the city.The crew gets railroaded to a desert like planet by a gnome they meet in the city. Ross befriends an alien, another victim of the gnome. The alien, we learn, is a mass of tentacles with eyestalks who talks passable space-lingo so communication is not a problem. He is a 3 in 1 being and has some mystical life restoring powers. A good companion to have says I.A wheeled some-thing-or-other kicks them back to the City, the nasty gnome and the Hobbies. Well, I guess you could say it's now showdown time. An agreement of sorts is reached. The hobbies will carry the party to wherever the mystic points so it's off to who knows where. The trees, oh yes the trees. Outside the city are trees planted in a uniform arrangement. These are special trees, many miles high that shoot nasty seeds at any who venture too close. There are rodents-like creatures that gather the seeds into huge underground bins. The speculation is that the trees are intelligent and are listening for voices from outer space. The seeds are information packets that are stored for harvesting by the gardeners who are presumably the creators of the city but where are they?Actually it is quite an interesting and entertaining story with pleanty of questions left unanswered. Simak in interviews has stated his great reluctance to write sequels and, in fact, he never did. This is one book where I wish he had.Getting back to the trees. These are several other Simak novels where sentinel trees play a role in the story. In one book trees are the last stage in Earth's evolution of intelligent beings after man and dogs - see Highway To Eternity (1986) his last published novel.

This review is for the classical music CD set of the complete opera Der Fliegende Hollander - The Flying Dutchman by Richard Wagner. This set consist of 2 CD's and was released on he Naxos label. Pinchas Steinberg conducts the ORF Symphony Orchestra. Peter Erdei is the Chorus master of the Budapest radio Chorus. These recording was made Vienna in September 1992.The two CD's come packaged in a large jewel box with individual cradles for each disk. This packaging is somewhat bulky but stand up nicely on a shelf and will take a lot of punishment without any damage to the disk. In addition the sturdy box makes a nice shipping container- if you ever were to part with these disks!Naxos, in my estimation, is the gold standard in CD package design and disk documentation. The front insert cover art reproduction, type fonts and type colors all contribute to ease of product identification. The front cover is very appropriate: the stage design for the first performance in Vienna 1871. The back insert provides summarized disk information, disk times and cast. A 60-page booklet included with this set is extremely useful. In addition to a detailed track listing it contains a synopsis of the opera. The events of each act and scene are described and keyed to the appropriate CD and track. As a first time listener to the entire opera I found this very useful. The sung text is provided in German.I am not a musician or musical scholar. I do enjoy listening to classical music and I have developed an interest in opera. From my first introduction to classical music I have been a fan of Wagner - I was mesmerized by the overpowering themes contained in his music. The compelling opera narrative and the engaging characters suggest to this listener that this would be wonderful opera to see in a live performance.The quality of the recordings; the bargain price and the Naxos packaging make this set well worth acquiring by the classical music enthusiast.

For many years I have confined my readings about the Viet-Nam War to non-fiction. It was with some trepidation I decided to read this novel about aerial combat and strategic bombing by Mark Berent. I was not disappointed and enjoyed the book.Mr. Berent has an insider's knowledge of the Viet Nam Conflict from a pilot's perspective having, according to the book's back cover, three tours of duty in South East Asia. This background is on full display as the story is chock full of pilot terminology and period military lingo. I found this layer of realism a big plus in my enjoyment of the book. A word of warning if you are unfamiliar with military pilot talk and terminology your enjoyment of this book could be severely diminished. A glossary of terms would have been helpful.The story interweaves the Viet-Nam experiences of several individuals. Most are pilots, one is a Special Forces officer and one is a General assigned to the White House. The main story line is the life of a military pilot during his tour of duty December 1965 to December 1966. Interspaced with his experiences are short "big picture" chapters back in Washington with LBJ and McNamara riding heard on the bombing campaign known as Rolling Thunder.Certainly stereotypes abound in the story after all it is a military novel. Nonetheless I found the tale compelling reading and factual as to events and terminology. If you enjoy these types of novels then I highly recommend this book.

The following comments are for the abridged AUDIO CASSETTE version of "John Adams" by David McCullough. Edward Herrmann reads the audio book with a copyright of 2001- Simon & Schuster markets this item. Although I own a copy of the printed book I have not read it as yet so I cannot comment on the abridgement but at 9 hours it certainly does cover a lot of material.This listener found the narrator, Edward Herrmann, an excellent speaker whose clear pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too. Mr. Herrmann has an admirable talent for subtly projecting the emotion context of a passage with a modest inflection his voice. In the recent past I have listened to Mr. Herrmann read "No Ordinary Times", "Einstein" and "Washington, A Life". He is clearly one of the foremost readers of audio books.This abridged audio book consist 6 AUDIO CASSETTE with a total playtime of approximately 9 hours. The tapes are secured in a flimsy cardboard holder with slots for each tape.I have read several other books by Author McCullough and in all of them he combines a sure grasps of the facts with clear narrative prose. His ability to "breath life" into some admittedly dusty historical stories and put them in relevant context makes for lively and informative reading.I can only marvel at the pivotal events in our nations history that directly involved John Adams. This man's basic humanity, intelligence, and love of freedom are thoroughly detailed in this excellent book.

The following comments are for the hardbound edition:Stephen Ambrose's book "Nothing Like It In The World - The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869" while certainly not the last word on the subject provides the interested reader with a succinct overview of a very convoluted but nevertheless fascinating subject.Ambrose intersperse his book with intriguing nuggets of railroad lore such as:- "The early railcars were too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. The seats were wooden benches set at ninety-degree angles that pained the back, the buttocks, and the knees. There was no food until the train stopped at a station, when one had a few minutes to buy something from a vendor. The train boiler was wood fired, causing sparks, which often flew back and set the cars or wooden bridges on fire. Accidents were common; sometimes they wounded or killed all the passengers. The engine put out so much smoke living "downwind" was intolerable...nonetheless people wanted a transcontental railroad."- "In 1853 Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (yes, that Jefferson Davis) sent out four teams of surveyors to explore possible transcontinental routes." Hmmm Davis preferred a southern route from New Orleans across Texas through New Mexico and Arizona Territories to San Diego.-"The surveyors of the chosen route had nearly two thousand miles to cover, over every kind of terrain. They had no maps, no balloons few if any settlements and only a vague idea of what lay ahead. Despite their handicaps, they did a grand job. In the 1950s and 1960s surveyors flying airplanes with modern implements and maps plotted out Interstate 80, they followed almost exactly the same route laid out by the original surveyors."-Grenville Dodge: "No railroad could be built across the plains until the Indians had been subdued." later he said "We've got to clean the damn Indians out or give up building the Union Pacific Railroad".-General Sherman referring to the Indians: "The more we can kill the less we will have to kill next year".-Samuel Reed: "Surveys were extremely difficult and dangerous because of the hostility of the Indians everywhere".-"The Indians despised the iron rail, which brought the white settlers and split the Great Plains into two parts since the buffalo would not cross the tracks"-"With the end of the Civil War thousands of young men were now available to build the railroads"-Avalanches caused such havoc to the efficient construction of the line through the Sierra Nevada Mountains that "Lewis Clement designed snowsheads that ended up covering almost fifty miles of track. One of them extended for twenty-eight miles without a break". One problem was fires since they were wooden.-"In order to build the Central Pacific "All materials had to be transported around South America or through Central America. They overcame lawsuits, opposition, ridicule, monetary uncertainty and losses. They had organized a vast labor force, drilled long tunnels, shoveled away snow, hauled locomotives and cars and twenty tons of iron over the mountains by ox teams. Nothing came easy. But they had done what other capitalist and engineers and politicians and ordinary folk thought impossible, drilled tunnels thought the Sierra Nevada, most of all the tunnel at the summit".- "Lincoln, a great railroad supported was referred to as "the distinguished Sucker" by a Iowa paper. Sucker was Iowa slang for someone from Illinois. Where does Ambrose get these gems?This book is highly recommended and not just for the text. The hardbound edition has some just incredible photographs of the construction, tunnels and trestles that convey just how difficult an undertaking it was. Also included are a series of very informative maps showing the construction from Council Bluffs Iowa to Sacramento California.In his conclusion Ambrose writes: "The locomotive was the first great triumph over time and space. After it came and crossed the continent of North America nothing could ever be the same. It brought about the greatest change in the shortest period of time".

The story summary for "The Stone God Awakens" will sound bizarre but credit the author for convincing readers to suspend our collective disbelief and become immersed in his imaginary world. Ulysses Singing Bear is a 20th century scientist that becomes frozen in an "instant of time" as a result of a scientific experiment that goes very wrong. Fast-forward a million years and "somehow" the stone god, as Ulysses has been referred too down through the eons, becomes unfrozen. He finds warring races of intelligent, but technologically primitive beings evolved from cats, raccoons, monkeys, bats, elephants etc, dominating this future. Ulysses pulls of a masterful deception and insures his survival by convincing the natives that his reinvention of military weapons-bows and arrows and gunpowder are manifestations of his "god-like" powers. Eventually he sets out on a journey to find other humans. In order to reach the coast, where he surmised men would dwell, he must transverse The Tree. This massive plant is several miles high, spreads out hundreds of miles and is inhabited by a host of deadly plants, animals and warring clans. A lot happens in this short book and at times it seems that the narrative was rushed along where longer passages would of provided a more satisfying reading experience."The Stone God Awakens"(1970) by Philip Jose Farmer (1918-2009) was published during the approximate period when his "Riverworld" stories started appearing. Although not part of "Riverworld" there are some interesting parallels such as the extensive use of airships and detailed descriptions of there function and operation.This reader found the science-fiction novel "The Stone God Awakens" a very entertaining reading experience. I must confess a great prior admiration for the author and a familiarity with many of his writings. Farmer wrote many books in series or with similar characters, this story is an exception. In a way that's a plus for readers new to this author - no need to look for other long out of print titles in order to obtain the full story.

I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when looked at in the right way did not become still more complicated - Poul AndersonThe fixed-up novel Orbits Unlimited (1961) by Poul Anderson (1926-2001) is, in my estimation, among his most successful from the early part of his career.Anderson draws parallels between the Quakers and the Russian old Believers [mentioned in the novel] and the constitutionalist: technology types upset with the existing welfare state. The Constitutional party decides to embark on a space voyage to a world that will support life. This avoids a violent revolution, utilizes the dry-docked space fleet and spreads man to the stars. The book is divided into several parts; the decision to immigrate, conflicts during the deep-sleep expedition and the challenges of setting up the colony. I found the plot expositions logical and the characters sympathetic and creditable. Along with a damn fine story we get some thoughtful ruminations of how a society might best serve its constituents."Portions of this book appeared, in somewhat different form, in ''Astounding Science Fiction'' for January 1959 and January 1960, and in ''Fantastic Universe'' for October 1959."

Aaron Burr, for those with even a modest knowledge of American History - and I include myself in that category, is usually quickly dismissed in polite conversation was a very negative connotation. After all he was the man that killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel, wanted to become the Emperor of Mexico and was tried for treason. Therefore let's not waste our time on this individual since he was, well, like the loud drunken uncle at a family reunion, someone to be barely acknowledged but avoided whenever possible.Burr by Gore Vidal presents a fuller, more nuance picture of the man. Vidal invents an earnest writer who is paid to interview Burr during the last months of his life. Thought numerous "flashbacks" Burr/Vidal reviews and discussed the numerous events of his quite remarkable military and political life.Unless the reader was familiar with the true facts of Burr's life it would be reasonable to question how many liberties Vidal took with the truth in order to produce this lively and engrossing novel. If you are going to read this book I would strongly suggest you read about Burr before hand. I looked up his entry in the Wikipedia and they have a very detailed entry as you may expect. It is quite remarkable that to the best I could determine, Vidal took no liberties with the historical facts. The author states as much in an afterward at the end of the book.Certainly not the last word on Burr but enough startling facts to keep the pages turning and the night lamp on.

"Sargasso of Space" (1955) by Andre Norton (1912-2005) is the 1st book in the series detailing the adventures of the crew from the Free Traders Starship Solar Queen. Web sites such as the Internet Science Fiction Data Base (isfdb.org) refer these publications as the Solar Queen books. The other publications in the series and the first edition date are as follows: "Plague Ship" (1956), Voodoo Planet (1959) and "Postmarked the Stars" (1969). It certainly would be desirable to read these books in sequence but it is not essential. Each story stands alone but references are made to events that took place in the previous volumes. Unfortunately the books are long out of print but are readily available on used book sites like Amazon at reasonable cost.One of the pleasures of this series and more particularly this book is the rather well thought out back-story that Ms Norton elegantly weaves into the text. Some of the elements that are sketched into the narrative as the story unwinds are as follows: We learn, for example, that a formal regiment of training in the various skills required to man a starship is compulsory for aspiring all-male crewmembers - yes male, no co-ed crews in these stories. Our protagonist, a newly minted assistant cargo master must deposit his "token" into a device that evaluates his training and personality and matches him to a ship where he will be most compatible. Norton's universe includes remnants of an ancient extinct civilization called the Forerunners. They left behind cryptic machines that play roles in many of her stories. Intelligent aliens beings and races play supporting roles in this story and add a layer of "otherworldliness" to the narrative.The story open with the officers of the Solar Queen attending an auction where they are bidding on the rights to obtain an exclusive trade and transportation franchise to a specific planet. The Free Traders cannot outbid the vast shipping combines for the more lucrative planets but must be satisfied with the dregs. The crew pools their resources and ends up with rights to a backwater planet called Limbo. Upon opening the sealed documents they find images of a planet that has multiple ancient scars from a devastating atomic war. The Solar Queen acquires several odd passengers who wish to travel to Limbo. Needless to say said passengers, Forerunner artifacts and mysterious aliens play a role in resolving the various plot entanglements.The "Sargasso of Space" was written and marked for the young adult market. With that in mind, and considering it was published well over 50 years ago it is still an entertaining book, recommended for Norton admirers and those individuals looking for a couple hours of outer space diversion.

"Derai" is book 2 in the 33 book science-fiction series the Dumarest Saga. Potential readers should be aware that the author has incorporates the themes for the series into each book. Therefore any of the stories can be enjoyed without recourse to any "essential information" contained in previous books. In fact there is no essential information in previous books. Each volume in the series is basically a well-crafted and entertaining science-fiction space adventure that can stand-alone. The central premise concerns Earl Dumarest who is traveling from planet to planet-seeking information concerning his home planet Earth. There are some complications that Earl must confront as he seeks to find his way home. For one, no one has every heard of 'Earth" and there is a secretive society of genetically altered humans, the Cyclans, who are not pleased with his snooping and inquiries.I have read several books in this series and they all have met or exceeded my criteria for a entertaining science fiction novel: logical plot progression, credible characters development, modest reliance of "super-science" rabbit out of the hat plot resolutions, an admirable central character, imaginative future societies, and respect for the readers intelligence. Author Tubb has worked these Dumarest stories since 1967 and we are told there is still more to come. If this is your introduction to the Sage welcome aboard.In "Derai" Earl Dumarest is persuade, for a fee payable on delivery, to "baby-sit" a young lady on a space voyage to her home planet. The woman in question, Derai, is the heir to one of the ruling houses on the planet Hive. Derai, in addition to being emotionally fragile has very rare telepathic talents that attract the attention of the conspiratorial Cyclan. Dumarest becomes emotionally involved Derai and must contend with her dysfunctional family.There is a real problem with the Dumarest Saga. None of the books are "in print" and if fact the last US mass market printing of a Dumarest paperback was in 1984 - "The Temple of Truth - Dumarest #31. Prior books in the series date back to 1967 with Dumarest #1 "The Winds of Gath". It is unlikely these books will be reissued any time soon, if ever. Even if they were I doubt they would reprint the wonderful Ace and DAW edition cover art. Thankfully we have the Internet and sites like Amazon were you could find these books up for resale. Your efforts will be rewarded with the acquiring of some of the most enjoyable SF books ever written.

It may come as a surprise to many readers of the Conan stories that Robert E. Howard (1906-36) left behind a considerable body of additional works. Seeking out books or stories by Howard has always been a difficult, if not impossible undertaking. Except for Conan most of Howard's other fiction is either long out of print or had never been published except for the original magazine appearance in the 1930's. Even the Conan stories are an editorial mess. My Lancer paperback Conan editions from the 1960's were "co-authored" by Lin Carter and de Camp. How that was accomplished 30 years after Howard's very early demise is very questionable. Therefore I was very pleased to see that Del Rey/Ballantine was issuing a series of books by Howard. The publisher must be commended for an extremely well designed set of books and way more importantly for the editorial research. Archives and manuscripts were checked to reconcile the texts. Each book in the series is fully illustrated with new artwork. The trade size paperbacks are sturdy and handsome and a welcomed addition to the interested readers library.Kull - Exile of Atlantis is another volume in the excellent Del Rey/Ballantine Robert E. Howard series.I found the 11-page introduction essay somewhat disappointing. The tone was very academic and seemed to me that the author assumed we were already well verse in Howard's body of works.A very helpful page just prior to the contents listing details when the stories were first published. Included are several story drafts and story fragments - talk about being complete!I had never read Kull stories before and, not surprising, kept thinking I was reading a Conan story. Nonetheless Howard was a natural storyteller and tall tale weaver. He shows a knack for economical descriptions of action scenes that provide the reader with a real POV feeling. Kull is not very introspective. As a king he seems bored with the protocol of the court and yearns for, well, the battlefield.A considerable plus in this book are the numerous illustrations. Almost every other page has a panel. Artist Justin Sweet captures the narrative events with great gusto.

"Finally there came a time when man was ready to admit that he was barred from space. At length Man knew the dream had failed and there was a bitterness and disillusion in looking at the stars, for the stars were farther now than they have very been. After many years, after great thundering in the sky, after a hundred million heartbreaks, Man finally gave up. It was just as well he did. There was a better way." from "Time is the Simplest Thing"The novel "Time Is the Simplest Thing" presents us with a future where mankind has discovered a method of traveling to the stars utilizing dormant extra sensory mental abilities that a few gifted individuals possesses. A vast corporate entity, Fishhook, recruits and trains these individuals and then manages their travels to extraterrestrial planets in order to gleen knowledge and commercial gain. The company maintains a number of retail sites where it markets extremely useful articles discovered during stellar explorations. As it evolves Fishhook becomes a very secretive and manipulative entity primarily concerned with it's own well being. Society, while desiring the utility of its products, is increasingly suspicious of Fishhook and the apparent "magical" talents they employ; abilities that most people do not possess. Fundamentalist-type preachers rail against the using of what appears to be ungodly talents. Our protagonist, a man possessed by an alien entity found on a Fishhook expedition, becomes a fugitive and encounters a spectrum of individual's in his quest. A quest I may add that is not clearly defined; it's just a part of the story and is used to nudge the plot along to it's conclusion.I found the overall story to be modestly entertaining but I could not "suspend my disbelief" to the extent necessary to do nothing more that damn it with faint praise. In summary the future the author presents - was just too improbable. I was also put off completely by the blatant use of 'incredible coincidences" that rescued the hero from several dire circumstances. OK ''incredible coincidences" are used throughout literature but the back story, the rationalization of how the event materialized is how we readers buy in to the author's universe. This back-story is mostly absent in this novel - things just happen! In one situation the hero was about to be hung and was unknowingly whisked through time, in another the super secret "star machine", critical to both Fishhook and the deranged anti-magic preacher, is stored in an old dilapidated shed with no guards or alarms(unbelieveable) and when near death in a ice storm an old over weight arthritic priest just happens to come rowing down river and delivers him to safety. The hows and whys of these events are apparently left up for the reader to work out.By all means read this book if you are a fan, like myself, of Clifford Simak. If you have never read one of his novels before I would recommend "Way Station" or "Time and Again" before "Time Is the Simplest Thing"."Time Is the Simplest Thing" was first published as a four part serial in Analog magazine under the title "The Fisherman". I can make the connection with that title from the events in the story. Then again perhaps editor John W. Campbell was appealing to his male angler readership.If you had read Simak's 1951 novel "Time and Again" you may have noticed some striking similarities with "Time Is the Simplest Thing". The protagonist of both books are stellar explores and are invested mentally with an alien entity that gives them god-like talents to travel through time and control the outcome of events. In my oppinion "Time and Again" is the better novel.

The Andre Norton novel "Star Gate" first published in 1958, in an intricately crafted science-fiction story employing the theme of alternative history.Ms Norton elaborates upon the concept that propels this story in her introduction to the novel. I will summarize her scheme using selected quotes from her Prologue: "History is not a collection of facts; it is a spiders web of ifs. If the American colonies had lost the Revolution, if the South and not the North had won the Civil War...the procession of such ifs is endless, exciting the imagination and spurring infinite speculation. There is a fascinating theory that two worlds branch from every bit of destiny action. Hence there are far reaching bands of parallel worlds born of many historical choices. Thus if some means of communication could be devised a man might travel not backwards or forward in time but across it to visit, for example, a world were England rules the entire North American continent." The "means of communication" her star traveling adventures employs is a "Star Gate" mechanism, a featured element of the book by the same title.The plot of this story concerns an interstellar expedition to an inhabited world and the unintended harmful consequence that result. The planet Gorth is primary agrarian ruled by hereditary clans. Various city-states with a technological level akin to England in the middle ages joust for supremacy. Over the course of generations the "Star Lords" interbreed with the native human stock producing mix breed offspring who acquire some knowledge of the superior technology of the Star Lords. Native fears, resentment and anger cause the majority of the Star Lords to eventually leave Gorth in their starships. A small remnant of Star Lord remain but despairing they can erases the negative consequences of their presence decide to escape to an alternate Gorth in a "Star Gate" accompanied by several of their mixed breed children. The bulk of the novel concerns the attempt by the gate travelers to rectify an appalling political sistuations found on the "new" Gorth.One theme that plays a critical role throughout this book is religion. Both the Star Lords and the Gorths have a similar belief system. How this can be is never explained but like many of Norton's novels there is usually a sequel where all is made somewhat clearer. Unfortunately in this case there was no follow up novel.This is an exceptional story and a fine example of Ms Norton's admirable writing ability and plotting.

Algernon Blackwood (1869-1951) was an English author noted for the remarkable number of "weird fiction" stories that he wrote."The Willows" details a canoe journey down the Danube by two adventures. They enter an extensive flooded swamp filled with a vast sea of low willow-bushes. A mood of dread and unease overshadows our unnamed voyagers. Blackwood maintains this gloomy mood by allusions to the noise of rushing water, branch movements and cloud formations. What he does not do, to his everlasting credit, is drag on stages some nefarious entity but uses the senses to convey a convincing atmosphere of dread.An excellent story of the supernatural by a masterful writer.

Welcome to a world were every human being who has every lived is resurrected randomly along an immensely long river valley surrounded by incredible steep mountains. Is this heaven, hell, purgatory or a dream, how did this happen, who created this world, what is the purpose of this "experiment" these are just some of the questions author Farmer thought his colorful historical characters explores in this intriguing novel. If you are a reader of Philip Farmer's fiction you are already aware that theological speculations are a major theme in his writings. See his novel "Jesus on Mars" for example. Farmer to his credit avoids getting bogged down in interminable religious speculations although religion does play an important role in this book. The ex-Nazi Herman Goering converts to a new religion, Church of the Second Chance. The Second Chancers are Quaker-like pacifist on a world that has quickly evolved into countless warring city-states spread out along both sides of the River. These encounters with Goering allow Farmer to digress from the action adventure mode to ruminate about love, war, religion and reincarnation. Rest assured we are quickly returned to the warring tribes, carnage and ethnic hatred just like back on old earth.One of the guilty pleasures of these books is the way Farmer depicts the interactions of actual historical characters. Farmer has done his research so when he introduces a character they have the history and cultural baggage from their Earthly existence. It is the classic "what if" fantasy. Imaging if American author Samuel Clemens and the English King John Plantagenet became uneasy allies in order to build a Riverboat, defeat their innumerable enemies and travel to the end of the River in order to solve the Big Mystery. The satisfaction I had from this book is that Farmer bring it all off and leaves you wanting to read the next book in the series.This novel is the second volume in the Riverworld series. The first book is titled "To Your Scattered Bodies Go". After having read both books in succession rest assured that "The Fabulous Riverboat" can be enjoyed without reading the first book in the series. Author Farmer brings the reading up to date with the events and characters from the previous volume. One individual from volume 1, Hermann Goering, plays a major role in book 2.

Serenades for Strings - Josef Suk & Antonin DvorakI have enjoyed listening to classical music for many years and am reasonable familiar with the major works by the "name" composers. My musical antenna goes up when I hear an enjoyable piece by an individual previously unknown to me.My introduction to Josef Suk (1874-1935) was on a BBC Music CD " An Enchanted Christmas" Vol. 17 No 4. The piece was Suk's Pohadka-A Fairy Tale. I next purchased "Serenades for Strings" and my initial admiration and enjoyment of Suk's works was fully rewarded. I am not a musician and can only recommend this disk based upon my subjective judgment.This is a Naxos CD. If you purchase classical CD's you already know the packaging, documentation and recording are first rate. If this is your first Naxos purchased I would wager it will not be your last.

In the July 1965 issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" a short novel or novella appeared title" Rogue Dragon" by Avram Davidson (1923-93). I still have my copy of that magazine and recall that it was a very entertaining story. It was even nominated that year for a Hugo Award. Alas it did not win, but a nomination suggests many readers admired the story. Later in 1965 Ace published a paperback edition of a greatly expanded version of Rogue Dragon. Until 2009 that was the only stand-alone copy of the expanded title.The transmutation of the 58-page novella to the 140-page novel was, in this reader's opinion, a failed experiment. A sharp, witty and entertaining story was infused with meaningless subplots and plot tangles that add nothing but page count to the story.Davidson was a highly regarded writer and his plot idea for this story was intriguing. In the far future Earth had been invaded by the Kar-Chee (not to be mistaken for the Kar-Chings, a mercantile race know for their avarice and lust for precious metals). The invaders eventually departed or died off - the book is not clear on this point. As a result of the invasion and its aftermath Earth became a destitute backwater of the galaxy EXCEPT for the dragon hunts. The Kar-Chee imported the beasts and they thrived on Earth. Wealthy inhabitants of the Galaxy travel to Earth to hunt the elusive and desirable dragons. Our protagonist is arranging a hunt for some potentates and is sidetracked in the expanded version into some meaningless and page filling machinations.

Grateful Dead at Fillmore East - 2-11-1969In addition to some great Dead tunes the sound quality on this two-disk CD set is excellent so potential buyer should have no concerns in that area.The Disks are identified as "Early Show" and "Late Show". For this listener the Early Show set was the stronger of the two but both are worth your ear time.This is an "unedited" transcription of the entire concert. Band tune-ups, PA messages and musician to audience chatter are included to give you that late 60's laid back ambience.Do we need yet another GD 40 plus year old concert CD...yes we do just like Mr. Grandy needs a drink... "Mr. Grandy, could you use a five dollar bill to buy some Thunderbird...Son, I could use a five dollar bill to buy a jug of Bird so rough Abe Lincoln's whiskers would be all lathered up with sweat"With apologies to Raymond Chandler.

The lives of the three Wade children, Holly, and the twins Crocker and Judy, are disrupted when their mother receives a telegram stating that her husband is missing in action in Vietnam. The children are packed off to their paternal grandparents home and mother takes a job in a hospital than restricts her home visits to weekends only.The grandparents, former caretakers for a run down country estate, live on the property after the owners death and survive by maintaining an informal town dump, refurbishing cast-off antiques and selling craft items. There is no central heat or electricity but the resourceful grandparents are survivors and have maintained a reasonably comfortable life for themselves. The children, with the exception of the older girl Holly, seem to have accommodated themselves to the altered circumstances from their previous lives in Boston.An overgrown maze, legends of family curses, a mysterious pillow and a stray cat draw the children into an encounter with a dreamworld of good and evil forces and witchcraft. The Wade children are black and this 1974 novel is very perceptive in how this issue is treated without becoming a dominating theme.Of her approximately 300 titles "Lavender-Green Magic"(1974) by Andre Norton (1912-2005) is one of six "Magic" books as listed on the Internet Science Fiction Data base for this author. That does not imply that this is not a laudable book, in fact it's very informative and entertaining, just a statement of fact.Some adult readers may be put-off by this book, since it does feature children as the main characters. In my oppinion the subject of witchcraft is a very adult topic and Norton will not disappoint readers of any age.

I have read approximated 20 novels by John Brunner (1934-95) and consider him to be one of finest writers of science fiction and one of the most unappreciated. It is with some regret that, in my opinion, this novel is not one of his better efforts. Frankly it was a chore to read to completion. It was not entertaining which has to be just about the worst thing you can say about a science-fiction novel. The story of a hunt for a kidnapped baby on Mars was just uninteresting and improbable for this reader.

Lincoln by Gore VidalIn my estimation a fictional story about actual historical characters and events can be an immense challenge for the reader familiar with the subject matter. The more knowledgeable the writer, the more apparent the novelization mirrors recorded facts just compounds the reader's dilemma. Do we fume and ruminate at the author for liberties he takes with our preconceived notions or do we toss up our hands and just enjoy the ride since it's only fiction after all. Those thoughts, and others quickly pass thought my mind as I began this book.This acclaimed best seller has, I'm sure, been dissected, x-rayed and tarred and feathered by "experts" of all political viewpoints. Because of the book popularity individuals who stoutly advocate a particular contrary point of view will feel the most oppressed.This reader was very impressed with how accurately the author's fiction tracked with the facts and observations concerning Lincoln's life as document by historians. Recommend with no reservations.I just adore historical nuggets of useless information. The terms "Tycoon and Hellcat" were the secret names for Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln that his sectaries John Hay and John Nicolay used - presumably behind their back! How did Vidal find that out?

Author Ketchum utilized a very large canvas in order to communicate a gripping account of the pivotal events of the American Revolutionary war. The trade paperback edition consists of 448 pages and another very generous 97 pages of notes, sources, bibliography and index. This is a book to be immersed in. I was constantly looking up locations on maps, recalling passages from biographies I had read about Stark, Arnold, Franklin and Washington and consulting the notes and index.The basic story of Saratoga can be summarized in one sentence. General Burgoyne surrendered his English and German army to General Gates at Saratoga New York as a result of over extended supply lines from Canada. Certainly there were other factors that contributed to the English loss such as mass desertions by the Indian allies, lack of carts and horses, summer torrents and blazing heat and lack of reinforcements from either Canada or from Generals Howe or Clinton. Overriding everything was a general sense of British hubris; "we shall put the fear of the British Lion into these rebellious bumpkins - send out our Hessian and the Brunswickians troops; now let us retire to our tent for several toasts to the King".The author deserves all the acclaim he received for this book. His ability to weave relevant quotes from letters, journal, reports, and even newspapers sustains the narrative and maintains high reader interest in the events, battles and every day trials of an army on the march.For this reader the most riveting aspect of the months long campaign by Burgoyne was the description of the appalling terrain, near impassable "roads" render into muddy quagmires full of gullies and tree stumps. Added to this the accounts of the unremitting gorilla tactics of the retreating rebels - felled trees, destroyed bridges and sharpshooter ambushes. Ketchum captures a vivid account of a bloody, dirty campaign in which the colonists were fortunate to prevail.

L. Sprague De Camp (1907-2000) and Fletcher Pratt (1897-1956), two noted science-fiction authors, concocted a number of related fantastical "bar room" stories collected for our enjoyment under the title "Tales From Gavagan's Bar".The twenty-nine stories, which comprise the entire body of works, were first published between 1950 and 1959; twelve were published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, three in Wierd Tales magazine and two in Fantastic Universe magazine.Each story begins and ends at Gavagan's Bar. Several of the regular customers will gather - Mr. Witherwax Doc Brenner, Mr. Jeffers order their preferred beverage - Yellow Rattler, Double Zombie, boilermaker with a long shot - all served by Mr. Cohan the bartender and the tales begin. An unfamiliar person with a quandary, an implausible occurrence, a recalcitrant spouse or a mystifying artifact perks the regular's interest and the story unfolds.One could only wish to slide up to the bar, order you favorite beverage and be able to add an insight, ask a question or just take in the ambience.After a few rounds the conversation sometimes dispenses some 1950's wit and wisdom such as:- "Mr. Baggot" I would say to him. Mr. Baggot, one of these fine days you'll be stepping off with some girl yourself and then you'll find out that a man may choose his own wife, but his friends she will pick for him, by God, just to remind him he has a leash around his neck." from "A Dime Brings You Success"-"What's that smell all of a sudden? It's like a whale died in here, a long time ago" from "Bell, Book and Candle"-When asked to relate a story a Mr. Medford tells bartender Mr. Cohan "Another one of these - double scotch - I can't fly on one wing". from "Gin Come in Bottles"-"This Joe was a feeble minded kid; I don't think he ever got beyond third grade and that was in a school for backwards kids". from "Gin Come in Bottles"The cover of my Bantam paperback states "A round of strange and supernatural anecdotes - it's on the house" I fully agree.

I was born in 1945 and for the next 18 years lived within 200 yards of a railroad freight yard and a major commuter line. The sounds, smells and vibrations of rail traffic and yard switching were part of the invisible fabric of my family's life. I ignored this "rail environment" as much as I did the car and truck traffic that ran outside my bedroom window on the state highway. Certainly I have sometimes waxed nostalgic about the steam locomotives I watched with rap fascination as a child and our occasional trip by rail coach. Nonetheless I had never given the history of railroads, how they came to be, what problems they encountered and what they meant to our Country any thought whatsoever.The book "Railroads Triumphant" by Albro Martin was a revelation to this reader. The subtitle of this book is "The Growth, Rejection & Rebirth of a Vital American Force". I was quite amazed by the fascinating history of railroads in the U.S. As the author makes very clear prior to, say, 1945, if you wanted to go somewhere, see something interesting, visit someone distant, conduct business, deliver or obtain goods your only true option was rail travel. The fact that this means of transportation was relatively inexpensive, reasonable safe and went practically everywhere did not happen by serendipity and that is the story related in this book.I want to make one thing clear to individuals considering reading this book. The author's focus is on the 'business" of railroad history written from an academic perspective. At times I found myself skimming over pages I found uninteresting. Nonetheless there is sufficient information on the topic of railroads that the curious adult reader will find this book worth reading.

Lord Dunsany (1878-1957) was, among many other notable accomplishments, a highly regarded writer of fantasy fiction. "The Charwoman's Shadow" is the second book I have read by Dunsany, the other being the highly regarded "King of Elflands Daughter".The "The Charwoman's Shadow" is a well-crafted story set in medieval Spain. Our hero Ramon Alonzo is apprenticed to a magician in order to learn how to turn stones into gold. You see the family estate has fallen on hard times and his sister's dowry chest is empty therefore Ramon is charged by his father to acquire skills in the black arts. Nothing good is ever gained from trafficking with sorcery and Ramon needs his wits, luck and some help from Father Joseph to outsmart the magician.The story is interesting to a point, but it is the glorious use of language and pacing that makes this book a most rewarding reading experience.I found the character of the magician very interesting and nuanced. When Ramon questions the loss of his soul the magician confidently tells him of the worthy reward he will receive if he fully developes his skills in the black arts: 'you will walk through Hell a flaming object of awe and reverence veneration while all abase themselves as you go by faces low in the cinders - an apparition of glory, and among the first of all the splendors of Hell." No wonder Ramon eludes the magician and returns to the land of light.Books classified as "fantasy" have been a mainstay of my reading interest for many years. I will not attempt to define just what constitutes "fantasy" except to say if you read it you will know it and will never inquire again. I must admit that so far my readings do not venture into the modern authors whose works seem to be taking over increasing amounts of space on the retail bookshelves.As anyone who develops an interest in a particular subject or themes will eventually read comments or opinions by other aficionados and authors. The one author that keeps being recommended is Lord Dunsany. During the period 1960-1975 the recommendations were usually followed by the disclaimed that, oh well, he's a great author, but none of his wonderful fiction has ever been published in the US. Fortunately this situation has changed but you still have to troll the Internet to find his books but thankfully they are available.

The following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "Grant and Sherman The Friendship That Won The Civil War" by Charles Bracelen Flood and narrated by the author. Harper Audio Book copyright 2005.This audio book consists of 5 CD's with a total play time of approximately 6 hours. Each CD is indexed into numbered tracks of approximately 10 minuets lengths. The audio quality is uniformly excellent. This listener found the author narrator a good speaker whose clear pronunciation and moderate pacing adequate to listen too. I have listed to quite a few audio books and it is very infrequent when an author reads his own works. I would of preferred a "professional reader" but that is just a personal preference from this listener.From their humble origins it is difficult to imaging that Grant and Sherman would achieve General rank let alone lead the North to victory. Flood spends considerable time informing us of the pre war years of these two individuals. I particularly enjoyed the story about Grant, who after resigning his commission because of drunkenness and reduced to selling firewood door to door in order to support his family is approached by a General officer he knew. "Good God, Grant what are you doing", Grant replies, "I'm trying to solve the riddle of poverty".The abridged story of these two Civil War Generals makes for an excellent companion on those long car trips or walks on the treadmill. You may, like this reviewer, want to read the book without abridgements.

I enjoyed this book for its humor. The talking horses here remind me of Mr. Ed. -full of droll comments and convinced they are smarter than their owners.Mr. Lewis expands the credibility of his fantasylands with his descriptions of Calormen, the city of Tashbaan and it's intriguing ruler The Trisroc (may he live forever). Calormen reminds me of 19th Century India which is not surprising since Lewis, an Englishmen, lived during the period when India was still part of the British Empire.As an adult reader I was amazed that the author would employ so many implausible coincidences to propel the plot. Whenever Shasta or Aravis found themselves with their backs up against the wall, well, time for another miracle. Certainly Lewis wrote these books for children and as an allegory for Christianity so in that context his plot convolutions are appropriate.

Brightness Falls From the Air - James Tiptree, Jr. (Alice Sheldon)"People talk about body language, but his perceptions are subtler that that... In the same way he knows the two passengers who are supposedly enraged at being dumped off here, aren't really angry at all. And that silent-so called-artist stinks of death. And the dear little old jolly Doctor would cut your throat for a half credit." from "Brightness falls From the Air"This story has some admirable qualities that I find very appealing in a science fiction novel. For one thing it takes place on a believable alien planet, has intelligent non-humanoid beings with a intriguing history and culture, involves a stellar event of considerable significance and the characters and events are set within the framework of credible space exploration.The story concerns some very unsavory occurrences associated with 13 tourists who are visiting the planet Damiem to observe and to be affected by the passing of the light and energy from a human caused Nova event. The tourist are, well, different: 4 teen "adult video stars" and their producer/director/cameraman, a very wealthy lady and her sister who has been in a coma for years, a doctor that reminds one of Dr. Strangelove, a light sculptor-not sure what that is, the young heir to the royal throne on another planet, two very suspicious characters claiming to have been being dumped off on Damiem and an attractive ship officer with some very serious emotional problems.Although it combines elements of detective fiction melodrama - a group on strangers in an exotic location - some innocent some maniacs - it is nonetheless an exceptional science fiction novel and highly recommended for interested readers.It did occur to me that those observing the passing of radiation waves from a Nova - especially on a planet with a very troubled history of alien-human relations would of been restricted to a highly screening group of scientist.A rarity in science fiction novels is an appendix detailing the cast of characters, glossary of terms, titles, places and things. I was constantly refering to it since the author is very imaginative with character names.Brightness Falls From the Air"(1985) was one of only two novels written by author James Tiptree, Jr. (1915-87). Triptree was the pen name for Alice Sheldon.

The science fiction novel "All Flesh is Grass" (1965) by Clifford D. Simak(1904-88) is an entertaining and thoughtful story. It begins with an attention grabbing science-fiction concept: a sleepy Midwest town, Millville by name, is suddenly surrounded by a transparent dome that allows inanimate objects - cars, food etc to past but, of course, not humans. Through our protagonist, Brad Carter, were become acquainted with the town's somewhat stereotyped characters: the officious mayor, the bully of a policeman, a weasel of a banker, the town drunk, the overworked, dedicated family doctor, an ex high-school girl friend attempting to rekindle a lost romance and many others. Thought a series of highly improbable circumstances we discover along with Brad Carter why the dome was put in place and by whom. The whom turns out to be an evolutionary freak of nature-flowers that are intelligent who wish to bridge the gap to our earth, an alternative earth through a slip in time.The author ruminates and explores several themes that permeate many of his other novels. In no particular order: mankind as a newly evolved sentinel race in a universe consisting of many ancient intelligences who look upon us as we would look upon a germ or a virus- see"Goblin Reservation" (1968); "A Choice of Gods" (1972) and "A Heritage of Stars" (1977). The concept of an infinite number multiple earths tangent to one another but with slightly differing evolutions - see "Mastodonia" (1978); "Special Deliverance" (1982) and "Ring Around the Sun" (1953) and oh yes, a evolved, intelligent vegetation - in this novel flowers but in several others trees : see "A Heritage of Stars"(1977) ; "A Choice of Gods"(1972) and "Highway To Eternity"(1986).A couple of notes concerning this book I found of interest:The town in the book Millville, is described as a small community in the mid-west where everyone knows one another. Cliff Simak was born and raised in Millville, Wisconsin current population 147. In addition to this book his novel "Way Station" is also set in Millville.The title "All Flesh is Grass" is a much-quoted phrase from Isaiah 40: "A voice says, "Cry out." And I said, "What shall I cry?" "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field. This is related to Palms 103: "As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field so he flourisheth; For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, And the place thereof shall know it no more". Simak knew his bible and the story of an alternate earth where man has disappeared and been replaced by sentinel plants - flowers - has a resonance with these verses. It should be noted that religion plays a very minor role in this story except for an off-hand remark by the priest, Father Flanagan - an interest choice on names for a Midwestern Catholic priest.I have read 22 of his 26 novels and I can tell you that book endings are problematical for this author - many of his books have, in my opinion, very unsatisfactory conclusions. I was delighted to find that this early novel had an appropriate endings that left this reader smiling.

These comments are for the Naxos CD of music composed by the Englishman Hubert Parry (1848-1918) consisting of "The Overture to an Unwritten Tragedy", Symphony No.2 and Symphonic Variations in E. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Andrew Penny made these recording in Glasgow, Scotland during August and September 1995.My introduction to this composer was throught listening to the on-line classical music programs on KUSC in Los Angeles. I am at the computer several hours each day so I listen to KUSC at I work. When I hear something that the appeals to me I look at the play list and make a notation. So much of the on-line rotations are from the standard repertoire, which is wonderful, but I believe that I need to expand my musical horizons occasionally. I purchased this disk through Amazon and greatly enjoed the music. I intend to increase my collection of Baron Parry compositions in the future.I cannot recommend this music based upon formal musical education or comparisons with other versions of identical pieces of music by different orchestras. I can only say I enjoyed listening to Parry's musical compositions and suggest that you may like them too.

Little FuzzyThis 1962 novel by H. Beam Piper (1904-64) was first published as an Avon paperback # F-118. The cover of that paperback by Victor Kalin provided, I believe, the reader with a reasonable accurate depiction of what a "little fuzzy" looks like - about two feet tall, humanoid, furry and very cute. Images of this cover are available for viewing on the web.This novel was nominated for a Hugo award in 1963 - it did not win but being nominated is an honor in itself. Surprisingly the books popularity had not greatly dimished since it was initially published having been reprinted numerous times - at least 14 editions by Ace publications alone. The book is now in the public domain and can be downloaded for free to e-readers.The popularity of this title has to do with two factors - an easily identifiable demarcation between the forces of good and evil and the author's depiction of the Fuzzies as loveable midget-like humanoid beings.Piper's human characters are either stout fellows, self sufficient and distrustful of authority or self important weasels, usually in positions of leadership more interested in there own fulfillment that the public good.Once made aware of the existence of "The Fuzzies" the planetary leaders scheme to disprove their intelligence since a formal declaration of the existence of intelligent "native" beings would invalidate their exploration charter and terminate a very lucrative and mining franchise.The defenders of the Fuzzies are without fault - paragons of virtue. When these cute, cuddly, furry humanoid just show up one day on a crusty old prospector's doorstep; without as much evidence as you can put in a thimble he is convince they are intelligent fellows and if your don't agree then your the enemy. Honestly you would like to believe that the discovery of a new intelligent race on a recently discovered planet would be such a momentous event that certain strict protocols would be enforced to protect humans from unknown microbes and the beings from social and cultural contamination - think the American indians for example. This is not the case.The foregone conclusion of Fuzzy intelligence is determined in a long, uninteresting legal proceeding that occupies the last several chapters of the book.

Pathways To Elfland: The Writings of Lord Dunsany by Darrell Schweitzer is a consicise guide to all the writings of Lord Dunsany.My main purpose in purchasing this book was to acquire some knowledge of Dunsany's fantasy writings. I have come to greatly admire this author although I have only read two of his fantasy novels. Mr. Schweitzer covers the author's fiction - and everthing else - with succinct plot summaries and personal reviewer's comments/oppinions.I was amazed to read that Lord Dunsany wrote extensively, and successfully (that is he made money selling his writings) in many fields: plays, essays, autobiography, (3 volumes) poems and straight fiction - even a few detective stories. He was more that just another fantasy words smith toiling in "that" fictional ghetto.Certainly this is a very specialized book and probably has limited appeal but if you are so inclined I would recommend it.A few words about the actual book: the one and only printing of this title is a scrumptious hardbound edition published by Owlswick Press in 1989. Let's start with a wonderful Tim Kirk color cover, rich boards, thick, cream colored pages and excellence binding, well, it screams quality. Alas, I own a Kindle and I read recently that sales of books on this E-reader exceeded printed books, too bad, to say the least. Honestly there is just something about the feel of a well made book.

Science fiction author Charles Platt has dreamed up a novel idea for handling the mammoth mountains of trash generated by our ever-affluent societies. In his future the garbage in loaded into "blimps" and towed and deposited upon one of the larger asteroids. A problem ensues when the inhabitants object to the ten-mile high deposit of earthly trash accumulation on their adopted "home". One solution is to split the asteroid: trash goes away and peace is restored to the inhabitants - of course there are complications.Although not a book I would recommend an environmentalist I did not trash it. It is an interesting story with a somewhat unbelievable premise.

Surprisingly my wife and I, both in our sixties, have never tried Nabisco's Mallomars cookies. Thanks to Amazon we ordered a box and found them to be much better then expected. We were anticipating a very "sweet" treat, which we don't care for. Instead the cookie had a robust semi-sweet taste. I attribute that to the chocolate used. It taste almost like baker's chocolate. Recommended if you have a desire for something sweet but not overpowering.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a fantasy adventure story set in the land of Narnia. We embark upon a voyage of discovery and danger with Price Caspian, Lucy, Edmund and the mouse Reepicheep. One of the distinct pleasure of reading this book is how the author, with economy of words, transports us as a passenger on the Dawn Treader - "when they turned aft to the cabin and supper, and saw the whole western sky lit up with an immense crimson sunset, and felt the quiver of the ship, and tasted the salt on their lips, and thought of unknown lands on the eastern rim of the world, Lucy felt that she was almost too happy to speak".A word of warning to new readers your enjoyment of this story will be greatly enhanced if your read the Narnia books "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" and Price Caspian" before the "Dawn Treader".As an adult reader of fantasy I can, without reservation, recommend this novel to all age groups. I surmise that many adults pass on the Narnia books because they "appear" to be written for pre-teens. The continuous popularity of the Narnia books long after the passing of Lewis and well before the recent films suggest to this reader that these books were intended for all age groups.

In my individual oppinion I would rate "The Penultimate Truth" a novel worth of the interested readers time. As characteristic of Dick his characters are secondary to his premise of political, religious and cultural alienation. In this book we are drawn into a vortex of paranoid stratagems as post atomic war "leaders" via for supremacy in their above ground villas while the majority of mankind are condition to live in underground "tank" city with wonderful PKD names like "The Tom Mix" and "The Judy Garland". The leaders fabricate bogus historical documentaries broadcasted to the tank dwellers to convince them that "above ground" is way "too hot" for human life. As one of the characters states: "We have created a machine that kills, that also lays down false clues: only in this case the false clues are authentic. We have here, Adams, the ultimate in fakery, the last stage in the evolution of an organization created for the purpose of manufacturing hoaxes."Dick adds to this strange yet intriguing story some unfathomable allusions to his abiding interest in religious mysticisms.I would caution potential readers that Dick takes about 50 pages to sort out his characters; detail the narrative conflicts and fills us in to the history of the era. So hang in there, the "trip' is worth the effort to let Dick be Dick.This title was first published in 1964 PKD's most productive year as far novel titles released. The other PKD novels first published in 1964 were: - "Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch", "Martian Time Slip", "Clans of the Alphane Moon", "The Simulacra" and "The Unteleported Man/Lies, Inc". When you consider that "Man In The High Castle" was published in 1962 and "Game Players of Titan" in 1963 it is safe to conclude that the 1962-64 was a peek period of creativity and activity in Dick's career as a science-fiction novelist.I have been endeavoring to read all the novels by Philip K. Dick - PKD. It is a guilty, and admittedly somewhat meaningless pleasure I can indulge in now that I am retired. "The Penultimate Truth" by Philip K. Dick is the 17th of his 36 science fiction that I have read. Not as good as "Time Out of Joint" (my personal favorite) or Divine Invasion" or "Radio free Albemuth" but still recommended.

For this reviewer "The Devil in the White City" was a noteworthy reading experience. This non-fiction story of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago and the cunning serial killer who used the fair to lure his victims to their death is a page-turner. Like his other book "Isaac's Storm" I was immersed in events and experiences of America's history that were completely unknown to me.As a reader of history my goal is the acquisitions of new information and perspectives, which this book fulfilled. I found the details of the World Fair's enormous construction project built with late 19th Century technology most noteworthy. I regret that the published had not included more photos and maps of the Fair and a description of its major attractions.Be warned Mr. Larson covers many themes and issues, which are described in great detail. This is not a book to blast through in an evening but one to read and reflect upon. I will admit that I found a few sections in need of a good editorial hand and the title seems to imply it is a novel but these are minor criticism and does not prevent me from recommending it to the Amazon community.revised 2012-01-11

Humor and satire are commodities in short supply on the science fiction shelves. It was very refreshing to find this delightful tale well written by two of the better authors in the field.Two members of Congress from opposite parties are reviewing veteran's pensions. Both decide to make political capital over an eleven-dollar pension to a Mr. Isachar Joyleg residing in the backwoods settlement of Rabbit Notch. The Democrat espouses upon the paltry sum while the Republican suspect outright fraud, Ike Joyleg indeed!After considerable bluster both Congressmen decide on a visit to Rabbit Notch in order to ascertain the facts of the matter. Much to the Democrat's consternation it seem that Mr. Joyleg has been receiving this pension since the Revolutionary War. When questioned about his apparent longevity he reveals his secret: a good soaking in moonshine for a few hours a day.I will now reveal any more details except to say the diction and dialog of Mr. Joyleg is a readers delight.Sad to say after the magazine version [Fantastic April & May 1962] this book has been only publish in paperback twice the last being 1973

Dreadnought - Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great WarThis book discusses the period in European political and military history from approximately 1860 to the outbreak of WWI in August 1914. Author Massie has made a valiant attempt to sort out the complex intertwining of European nationalism, colonialism and militarism. Add to this devil's stew Kings, Kaisers and Tsars who were related by blood and marriage - no wonder the pot boiled over.This is a massive book. The trade paperback edition has 908 pages of text with another 130 pages of supporting documentation. The author engages the reader by his clear prose, extensive use of appropriate quotations and his chapter organization. Each of his 46 chapters centers around one major participant in the military or diplomatic history of the era. We are presented with a detailed biographical sketch of the individual, how they achieved their position and their interaction with other statesmen or members of Royalty. Although the majority of the text is devoted to diplomatic issues the navel competition between Germany and England is fully discussed.In a few years we will be commentating the centennial year of the beginning of WWI. It will be a gloomy and sad day for those acquainted with the true facts of the origins of this conflict. We all desire for a simple answer to complex historical question such as how did the war start, and, of course, who was to blame? Some will say blame Kaiser William, or Bismarck or the Bosnian assassin or Sea Lord Fisher or even British Dreadnought fleet. This book provides the reader with a more nuanced idea of what caused this catastrophic war. I concluded that the collective European mindset of power, place and position deeply rooted in the aristocracy, senior civil service and the military resulted in the inevitability of the World War.Sir Edward Gray England's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated at the outbreak of the war: "Thus the efforts of a lifetime go for nothing. I feel like a man who has wasted his life" and "The lamps are going out all over Europe" and "We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime".

I have read several books concerning the New Deal and President Franklin Roosevelt. All commented upon that extraordinary political phenomenon from Louisiana: Huey P. Long. FDR is quotes as remarking that along with Douglas MacArthur, "He(Long)was one of the two most dangerous men in America". Huey Long is today just a footnote in American History. His assassination in 1935 under very mysterious circumstances ended a promising political career.I cannot comment as to the veracity of any of the "facts" presented in "Every Man A King". The reality is that Long was a consummate politician in a State and Era where "politics" was played fast and loose. Long had Presidential aspirations. What better way to burnishing one's image and extol one's political wisdom than in a self published autobiography.It is hard to dislike this book. It has the "sound" of a 1930 southern politician dictating his thoughts, which were then typed verbatim. No wordsmith polished these sentences to appeal too more "educated" readers. Long includes extensive quotes from newspaper editorials and numerous footnote to buttress his case. The inclusion of several relevant Louisiana political cartoons from 1930's and photos of Long's public works projects add to the considerable charm of this book.The De Capo Press edition is an exact reproduced of the original 1933 publication - including the attractive 1930's style typeface.

I have always been curious about just what exactly happened in California in 1849. I could tell you that gold was discovered and there was a "rush" to travel to the gold fields and that many people ended up very disappointed. That was about the extent of my meager knowledge on the subject.I was pleased to pick up this excellent book by Dale Walker. The basic facts are about as I surmised but as they say the devil is in the details.The author devotes many pages relating the time consuming and dangerous journey to the California gold fields north of San Francisco. At the time the vast majority of the county's population resided east of the Mississippi. Therefore you had three unappetizing choices to get there: a mule train across the western desert and mountains; a sea voyage around South America or a slog across Central America and then a journey up through Mexico. The author's inclusion of eyewitness accounts of encounters with jungle fevers, storms at sea and searing desert treks confirms that there was no easy way from the East to the West in 1849.In another section the author discusses the typical 49er. It is easy today to dismiss these men as naive, gullible, greedy and the dregs of society looking for the "easy money". The fact was that most men in 1849 were being crushed by poverty in the cities or barely surviving as farmers. The possibility of making a fortune far out weighed, for many, their inevitable short and hard lives. Puffed up press accounts telling of "tripping over golden nuggets" also helped motivated many thousands to undertake the treacherous journey to the gold fields.As the author tells us some few did make a fortune but the vast majority traded in one life of poverty for another. Working the gold fields subjected men to inevitable encounters with the most unhealthy of life styles. If they survived the poor sanitation, inadequate diet and lack of adequate shelter then the total lawlessness of the towns awaited them. Some few with a modest accumulation of gold soon found the allure of liquor, gambling and "sporting ladies" would quickly relieved them of their hard earned mining success.The author places the gold rush in the historical context of the War with Mexico and California's Independence. He also includes biographical discussion of key players such as John Sutter, John Fremont and others. This is a fine overview of the subject that satisfied my curiosity and greatly contributed to my meager knowledge of the subject.

The title of this book "Roosevelt and Churchill Men of Secrets" is very accurate as to its contents. Both men consumed vast quantities of intelligence, planned espionage, initially oversaw vast networks of spies and code breakers and utilized the secrets or "golden eggs" as they are referred too, to hastened the defeat of the axis powers.This book is a good antidote to the sterile version of WW2 history that focuses on battles won and lost, territory gained and weapons destroyed. The fact is that without "intelligence" the allies' efforts would be like a blinded boxer wildly swinging against an opponent.The author's focus is on the principles, Roosevelt and Churchill. But it was the British and later the Americians spy masters that provided the data, managed the networks, planned the strategy, selected agents, and lived with the consequences inherent in this deadly game. The author weaves their story into the text, which adds, in my estimation, to the readability and usefulness of the text.Interesting, informative, useful and, in places astonishing - what more could you ask for in a non-fiction book.The following comments are for the unabridged audio version of this title. The reader is Richard McGonagle who, when quoting directly from Churchill or Roosevelt, changes his voice to imitate the cadence and tone of the leaders. I have listened to numerous non-fiction audio titles and have always found the reader's attempt at changing his voice a major distraction, but not with this title. Mr. McGonagle's talent adds immensity to the pleasure of listening to this audio book.

The following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "Theodore Rex " by Edmund Morris. This is the 2nd volume in author's 3-volume biography of Theodore Roosevelt. Harry Chase reads the book and Random House Audio markets this item. It should be noted that "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" in the title of the first of three volumes in author Morris's biography of President Theodore Roosevelt. It is highly recommend that the books be read or listened too in sequence.This listener was pleasantly surprised to find that the narrator, Harry Chase, did a better job reading this volume of the trilogy. I did not enjoy his voice on "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and thought he did a marginal job with the material. I noticed that on the next volume in the series, "Colonel Roosevelt", he had been replaced.This abridged audio book consist 8 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 9 hours. The disks are secured in two standard cardboard multi CD holders. These two inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD. To make life easier for myself I add an identifying sticky note on the CD holders.This book covers the period from Roosevelt's becoming President upon the assassination of McKinley to the day he leaves office at the completion of his 2nd term. This audio book provided me with many hours of entertainment and education. Prior to listening to the first two volumes the person of Theodore Roosevelt, the events and the era were terra incognito to me. Volume 3, if the reviews can be trusted, should be as rewarding as the first two audio books.

Storm Over WarlockAndre Norton (1912-2005) was a prolific writer primarily in the field science fiction and fantasy. She has written well over 100 novels, an amazing fact in itself, but more impressive is the high regard readers have for her stories.Norton wrote many novels in related series. The book under review "Storm Over Warlock (1960)" is the first in her Forerunner Series, which consist of the following additional novels: "Ordeal in Otherwhere (1964)", "Forerunner Foray (1973)", "Forerunner (1981)" and "Forerunner, Second Venture (1985)".The story protagonist is a hard scrapping young man, Shann Lantee, who signs on as the roustabout and animal handler on an initial survey expedition to an Earth-like world. Surveys teams of Earth-type planets include highly trained mutated animals, in this case two wolverines, which are used as scouts and guards.Other that a full measure of innate common sense and street-wise survival skills Shann has no professional expertise and is generally looked down upon by the expeditions highly trained crew members - Terran Survey Corps personel. As the story opens the insect-like Throgs attack the Survey Corps encampment and kill all in the camp. The space faring Throgs are in a deadly competition with mankind for habitual planets which are scarce and far between.By sheer luck Shann and his two Wolverines were away from camp and avoided the massacre. Shann only goal is to stay alive and evade the Throgs who suspect a survivor of their butchery. Shann eventually teams up with another Survey Corps officer that coincidentally crash lands near where he was hiding out. The officer, Thorvald, seems to have his owe agenda and assumes a condescending attitude towards Shann.You may suppose upon reading the plot outline of this 50 plus year old story that it's just another dated "space-opera" of no interest other that to dedicated fans or academics.Saying anything more about the plot would spoil the pleasure of discovery but I would make the case that this is a novel that admires of intelligent and entertaining science fiction should consider reading. There are a number of reasons that lead me to make that statement: a sympathetic, believable character that propels the plot, a carefully crafted lurking, sense of unknown dangers beyond normal human experiences, detailed and credible encounters, some beneficial some deadly, with alien flora and fauna, enigmatic confrontations with mystic-like aliens and enough weirdness that begs additional explanations in future stories. The book ends with a evenhanded finale that does not short change the readers.Reading this book will not change you life but it will provide a few hours of wonderful entertainment.

Reaching for Glory" by Michael Beschloss is an edited transcription of secretly recorded tapes made by Lyndon Johnson during 1964-65. This is the second volume of these tape transcripts the first being "Taking Charge - The Johnson White House Tapes 1963-4". Readers with an interest in the seminal events of the 1960's: Kennedy assassination, civil rights, Vietnam to name a few will find both books riveting and eye-opening. Beschloss provided numerous footnotes, which is very helpful since many of the players are just footnotes themselves and have long exited the arena of the living. Also helpful are introductions to each transcribed recording putting the events and players into context of the events and times.Although in my oppinion there is generally no substitute for reading a book I must admit to an exception in this case. I have a copy of abridged versions of both books on audio cassettes and to hear Johnson, wheel, deal and cajole the likes of Eisenhower, Hoover, Dr. King, George Wallace to name a few is just amazing and revelatory.LBJ was a consummate puppet master. Listening to him manipulate and humiliate Vice President Hubert Humphrey or attempt to cozy up to Jackie Kennedy for example provides a disturbing picture of this very talented but devious man. The book or the book-on-tape versions are both highly recommended.

McNamara - Henry L. TrewhittAuthor Henry Tredwhitt was the diplomatic correspondent for Newsweek reporting on the Berlin crisis, the Department of Defense and Vietnam. His writing has the reporter's immediacy, a pragmatic impression of "I was there" authenticity.This volume was published in 1971. That fact was considered when I purchased this book in 2010. My purpose was to read another knowledgeable viewpoint of McNamara's shaping of defense policy and in particular the issue of our involvement in Viet Nam. Certainly the author never had access to then classified documents or the many subsequently published memoirs written by Kennedy and Johnson principals but, nonetheless, my expectation was that his first hand knowledge and perspective would give him a clear vantage point of the subject. I was not disappointed. The chapters covering Viet-Nam were interesting to this reader.Although this book is subtitled "His Ordeal in the Pentagon" it also provides the reader with a detailed biography of McNamara's career and family history prior to joining the Kennedy cabinet in 1960. It should be mentioned that Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to former secretary Robert A. Lovett; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. The author also includes a useful history of the office of Secretary of Defense and a biographical sketch of all previous office holders.McNamara early enthusiastic support for the war was a lighting rod for harsh criticm by both the left and the right. The liberal student at Harvard booed him off the stage and Goldwater in a campaign stop in Michigan in 1964 dropped this gem: "A one time looser with the Edsel right here in Michigan, a four time looser in terms of trips to Vietnam and a all time looser if his policies and the policies of the Administration are not changed in 1964". Unearthing that quote made this book worth buying.Although Robert Strange (his mothers maiden name) McNamara public perception is that of a tediously serious efficiency expert he did have another side rarely revealed. The author tells of a costume party for Averell Harriman where McNamara showed up with his head covered in aluminum foil. That picture would be priceless.The author includes a helpful index but considering the extensive use of quotes in the text the lack of footnotes and a bibliography does diminish the usefulness of the book for research. Nonetheless I would recommend this book - particularly if you are a student of the Vietnam War and of the key individuals that shaped war policy.

"Gary crouched in the airlock of the Space Pup, with the outer valve swung back. He made sure his pistols were secured in their holsters and cautiously tested the spacesuit's miniature proplusions units." from Cosmic ManhuntThe novel "Cosmic Engineers" [1950] has a curious publishing history that may account for it's uneven narrative. Astounding Magazine published a three part serial in 1939 titled "Cosmic Engineers" by Clifford Simak. The page count for the three parts were approximately 58 after you subtract the pages with story illustrations. In 1950 Gnome Press published this title in hardbound at 256 pages. I can only speculated but a possible scenario would have an author's agent offering Gnome an expanded version of a popular space-potboiler for it's upcoming line of "space novels". The agent informs Mr. Simak of the publisher's generous advance if he can turn his 1939 story into a novel. In any event the original story was greatly expanded. I have not read the Astounding version but did manage to complete the expanded version. In addition to the Gnome hardbound there have been 5 U.S. paperback editions - the last published in 1982 and several foreign editions.The plot concerning two men and a woman, currently on Pluto, summoned by the Cosmic Engineers, robots as it turns out, to prevent the collision of two universes. While the math whiz of a young lady, rescued from 1000 years of suspended animation, is designing a universe saving device all work is put on hold to defend against an attack by the Hellhounds of Space. In order to counter the Hellhounds a trip is made through time to the far future to talk to the last man living on earth. Yes, that's the plot in broad outline. To be honest I found reading and finished this novel a chore.Who would I recommend this book too? People like myself who insist there is some usefulness in reading all of Simak's 26 novels and individuals who out of curiosity would like a flavor of what "thrilling stories of super-science" were like and, of course, academics. Casual readers would be better off reading any other novel by Simak an author that I greatly admire.

Where the Evil Dwells - Clifford D. Simak (1904-88)The author situates the readers in a typical Simak fictional locale - an alternate earth. A fiefdom is being crossed by Roman legionaries heading north where the barbarians are massing. The Roman Empire is ruled by a weak, indifferent, Pope. The motivating tension in this tale is "The Evil" who resided in "The Empty Lands".The plot stimulus is established very early in the story. Our intrepid hero, Harcourt, heir to the local fief, sets out on a twofold quest: find his lost love and recover Lasandra's prism within which is housed, according to legend, the soul of a saint. Legend or not that's sufficient motivation for the local Abbot, Guy, to join the quest. Harcourt's life long friend is the cryptic Knurly Man - he signs on and jousts with the Abbot on points of theological hair splitting. To round out the fellowship is young Yolanda - an orphan with mysterious talents. The problem is that the objects of desire are in the before mentioned Empty Lands where the Evil dwell.Almost the entire book details the quest: meals consumed, weapons tested, obstacles overcome, hills crossed and enemies opposed. In fact this narrative tension, detailing the complex relationships between the quest members, strange beings encountered and comprehensive battle descriptions results in an entertaining couple of hours of reading.As mentioned the motivating tension in this story is "The Evil" who resided in "The Empty Lands". Notwithstanding the pleasure derived from this entertaining novel I have to fault the author for completely omitting any explanation concerning the origin or motivation of "The Evil". It would be simple to speculate that "The Evil" is mankind's sinfulness and the story is an allegory of our redemptive struggle but that does seem too pretentious and does not square with Simak's statements during interviews.Just for the record, as they say, readers who may have read Simak's 1978 novel "Fellowship of the Talisman" would recall that the fantasy opponents were also referred to as "The Evil" and the quests for the Talisman was throught their lands. Also his "Enchanted Pilgrimage" (1975) was a fantasy quest.This novel was the next to last of Simak's 26 novels - the last being "Highway to Eternity" in 1986. Reader's farmiliar with his fiction will be either elated or disappointed to find no robots, extended pastoral ruminations or references to Minnesota, Wisconsin or newspapers in this book. Theological banter, in a whimsical tone, abounds between Abbot Guy and the Knurly Man but philosophical ruminations are wholly absent.

"Mr. Graves..." "What is it?" "You think there are people out there? Out on them stars?" "I wouldn't know. No one knows. It stands to reason there must be other life somewhere." "Like us?" "No, I don't think like us." from They Talking Like Men"They Walked Like Men" (1962) concerns a number of incredulous events that befall a Mr. Parker Graves the science reporter for a large metropolitan newspaper in the mid-west. Interestedly author Clifford Simak was for many years a science reporter for the Minneapolis-St. Paul Tribune. This accounts for the vividly detailed descriptions of the inner workings of a busy newspaper. We find Graves hard at work in the newsroom - dealing with deadlines and cantankerous co-workers. This opening section of the book has the sense of autobiography and drew this reader into the story.Mr. Grave makes the acquaintance of alien humanoids whose true appearances are bowling balls with a peculiar aroma. These aliens in human form are very clever interstellar real estate tycoons. Utilizing the proper and correct titles and deeds consistent was the legal requirement of the real estate profession they are buying up commercial and residential properties at whatever price necessary. Graves is warned by another alien being - a big shaggy talking dog- that the bowling balls want to not only buy everything but evict homeowners and shut down businesses - all legal like - in order to in effect evict mankind from the Earth.This book has the feel of an extended short story that had be padded out to "fit" the publishing requirements for a novel. As a short story with its snappy dialog, interesting aliens-talking dog and bowling balls, and the quirky ending - well it could of been excellent. As a novel it lost it's effervescence for this reader after about 100 pages. Nonetheless it is by Clifford Simak so if you are so inclined by all means read it and form your own oppinion.

c 11 hours 9CD's Edward Herrmann Simon and Schuster AudioThe following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of " The Great Bridge - The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge" by David McCullough. The reader is Edward Herrmann. Simon and Schuster Audio markets this item.Over the past several years I has listened to many audio books. They have been my faithful companions on many extended business trips and along innumerable miles walking the treadmill. In my oppinion Edward Herrmann is, by far, the best narrator for these products. His easy conversational voice is, to me, like a good friend sharing with you a wonderful story just for your personal enjoyment. I never had the notion he is reading from a script - although, of course, he is. He also refrains for the most part from trying to mimic voices of characters in the story - for me that rarely works. He does change his tone to convey emotion just as we would in a conversation.This unabridged audio book consist 9 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 11 hours. The disks are secured in two standard cardboard multi CD holders. These inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD. To make life easier for myself I add an identifying sticky note on the CD holders.John Augustus Roebling (1806-1869) and his son Washington Roebling (1837-1926) designed and engineered the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge 1870-83, which in itself is a fascinating chronicle. That part of this audio book is covered in approximately 5 hours of the 11-hour total playtime. Intertwined with the actual construction details is a plethora of information concerning: history of construction techniques of other bridges, the composition of the Brooklyn Bridge board of directors with biographical information, analysis of various lawsuits brought against the Bridge corporation or Roebling, New York City political corruption as exemplified by William F. "Boss" Tweed of Tammany Hall and several other topics. I found these issues very informative and felt they enhances the overall story of the bridge. Other listeners may feel these topics contain "too much information" and could have been edited.

War That Made America - A Short History of the French and Indian War - Fred Anderson - Penguin paperback edition"When a desperate Indian chief murdered a French ensign before a young Virginian's horrified eyes in 1754, then, an old world - one in which native peoples played a determining role in diplomacy and war - began to pass away...That we remember so little of this earlier world - and understand so little of its peoples and their ways - bears witness to the evanescence of all historical worlds...to grasp the story of the great transformation that the French and Indian War began one must understand it as a cautionary tale...that demonstrates the unpredictability and irony that always attend the pursuit of power." From the epilogue of "War That Made America""The War That Made America" (2005) was a revelation to this student of American history. Author Anderson goes to extraordinary lengths to convince the reader that a lucid understanding of the motivations of the three principles in the French and Indian War - Native Americians, French and English - is essential to understand what takes place several years later - The Americians Revolution. I for one am convinced.The author's unambiguous story telling talent brings to life episodes and events of the War that seem to leap off the page with narrative force. Occasionally the author will step back from an event and put an issue into a historian's perspective without pontificating - see quote above for an example.With all its commendable points this book is, after all, just an expanded outline -the canvas is truly immense. I made several mental notes to follow up on certain events and individuals that peeked my interest. I was particularly absorbed with chapter 21 - "The Plains of Abraham". A pivotal battle, two seasoned commanders, events hinge on apparent chance and then both leaders are killed in battle - an amazing story told extremely well.One of the "extras" that makes this book so useful for students and general readers is the approximately 96 illustration and maps woven into the narrative. The maps were particularly helpful even for a person, like myself, who thought he knew his geography of the Eastern half of the country.One of the few history books I truly regret that I had not read years earlier - highly recommended.

One of the indispensable tasks necessary for a successful space opera is to reasonably convince the reader that the imaginary universe presented has the ring of plausibility. Jack Vance, a master in creating believable worlds and societies, excelled himself in this novel. One technique he employs is a quote from an imaginary encyclopedia at the beginning of each chapter relating to the background of the story.Malegate the Woe is a Star King, aliens masquerading as men, whose activities include enslavement of entire planetary populations. Kerth Gersen's family is a victim of one of Malagate's raids. Gersen vows to spend his life hunting down Malagate types in the lawless portion of space referred to as the "beyond". Vance uses the detective novel plot structure of isolating the suspects in a closed location [space ship] and allowing the guilty party to reveal himself. Vance is able to convey a real sense of evil in the personages of Malsgate the Woe and his disfigured sidekick Hilhemar Dasce or Beauty Darse.If you have read other Vance novels you are aware of his penchant for colorful character names. This book is certainly no exception: Malegate the Woe and Beauty Darse.A somewhat shorter version appeared in Galaxy Magazine copyright Galaxy Publishing 1963. The Berkley edition paperback published April 1964 is the first book edition. Vance went on to write 4 addition books in which Kerth Gersen hunts down the Star Kings. These books are referred to as The Demon Prince novels and all are highly recommended. The titles are listed in the order published: The Killing Machine (1964), The Palace of Love (1967), The Face (1979) and The Book of Dreams (1981).

These comments are for the Audio Renaissance book of "Theodore Roosevelt" by Louis Auchincloss. This audio book consists of 3 cassettes with a playtime of 4 hours. Ira Claffey reads the book and does a very credible performance. I was pleased to read on the cassette storage box that this production was unabridged.The three cassettes are not stored in individual hinged boxes but are secured in a sturdy plastic case with a paperboard cover that opens like a small hardbound book. In fact the case is designed to stand up on edge making it an ideal storage medium for a library shelf or your home bookcase.I would like to highlight two items I took away from this book.The issues we confront today with the progressive movement - taxes, business regulations, and social policy - originated with TR's "Bull Moose" third party campaign during the 1912 presidential election. We are still wrangling over the same issues and hundred years later.One of the chapters in this book consists of candid quotes from TR's letters. His way with words, caustic expressions and startling opinions are refreshing and surprising. I certainly enjoyed hearing them.This audio book is part of the series "The American President" with Arthur M. Schlesinger as general editor. Different authors write these short biographies of the Presidents so you a presented with an assortment of perspectives and styles. I have previously listened too the audio versions of Jefferson, John Quincy Adams and Eisenhower and have read the Nixon volume. If you are inclined these volumes provide an excellent introduction to our history and the politics that rule and, at times, confound our destiny.These volumes are certainly not the last word on the subject as I found out recently with I started listening to the Edmund Morris monumental three-volume biography of TR.

"The Beast Masters"(1959) by Andre Norton (1912-2005) is a science-fiction adventure story that does not seem dated since it's initial publication over fifty years ago. The reason for this is two-fold: the author's superb talent for fashioning intriguing characters and her disdain for phony-science terminology to justify the science-fictional aspects of her story.On the sparsely populated agricultural planet Arzor, isolated ranchers herd and harvest a highly desirable native animal -frawns, for meat and hide export to other planets. Over several generations the settlers, colonist from Earth, have developed an uneasy alliance with the humanoid intelligent natives called the Norbies. The natives assist the ranches rounding up the frawns but do not, except in very rare instances, socialized with the Earth born. Some ranches do not trust the Norbies and blame them for missing horses and slaughtered frawns.Hosteen Storm, the protagonist of this narrative, has quite a background: Navajo Indian, cashiered veteran of an interstellar war in which Earth was totally destroyed, leader of a Beast Master team - a group of genetically altered animals with whom he can control via telepathic connections, horse breaking expert and an inborn ability to survive in the wilds on an alien planet. The story of his many travails on Arzor including interactions with the Norbies, a battle with the arch enemy aliens -Xil and the discovery of vast underground alien gardens and artifacts are just some of the subjects of this page-turning book.Troubling to this reader is the fact that the only technological devices used by the ranchers in this book are "stun guns" but no portable radios or mechanized travel vehicles. The absence of radios, jeeps or helicopters readily available to a space traveling society particularly on a planet with many deadly carnivores and subject to flooding rains stretches my credibility. Putting that aside the story is pure escapist adventure and a recommended read for all ages. I was very pleased that Ms Norton wrote a sequel, Lord of Thunder.

Goblin Reservation by Clifford D. SimakThe Goblin Reservation (1968) by Clifford D. Simak (1904-88) is a jumble of science fiction and fantasy themes. Individuals are fetched from the past; grotesque aliens mingle with humans; a genetically altered saber tooth tiger purloins steaks off of restaurant tables; the hero's companions are a Neanderthal man with a thirst for moonshine and a ghost; and there is a seething dispute between the trolls and the elves over some doctored ale. Just to keep it interesting Simak add the fact that our protagonist, Peter Maxwell, had an identical duplicate the was killed just prior to his return to Earth from a mysterious "roofed-in crystal planet" and we cannot overlook the puzzling artifact found in the distant past that is causing quite a stir among the alien community. Simak, to his esteemed credit, can somehow maintain a level of credability and reader interest in this convoluted story.Readers farmiliar with Simak's fiction will recognize these reoccurring topics that woven into the text: the location is Wisconsin; comments about the beauty of the autumnal landscape abound and there some serious musing about the role of man in the Universe and the strong possibility we are part of a grand design.A lot of the story seems like the author was just letting his imagination create stream of ideas onto the page with little forethought or editing for that matter. Nothing at all wrong with that, I say. Not, in my oppinion, one of his better novels but worthy of study by students and fans of speculative fiction. First published as a two-part serial in Galaxy Magazine April and June 1968.

The Fallible Fiend (1973) by L. Sprague de Camp (1907-2000) is a modestly entertaining fantasy set in the land of Novaria. Readers of de Camp's "The Reluctant King" trilogy: "The Goblin Tower" (1968), "The Clocks of Iraz" (1971) and "The Unbeheaded King" (1983) or his last Novaria book "The Honorable Barbarian" (1989) will be farmiliar with the landscape, place names and the humorous - tongue-in-cheek tone of the story.Zdim, a demon from the Twelfth Plane is indentured to a wizard in Novaria. Zdim is highly intelligent and follows his instruction to the very letter - a commendable attribute that nonetheless entangles him in a bewildered confrontation among the contrary city-states of Novaria.Frankly this reader found the story line somewhat contrived and the plot overly drawn out. Also missing was some of the sharp and witty dialog that made "The Reluctant King" trilogy a favorite of mine.For those who may be interested a shortened version of this book was serialized in the bi-monthly magazine Fantastic in the December 1972 and February 1973 issues.

The Origins and Legacies of World War I - D.F. FlemingThis long out-of-print book, published in 1968, is a classic primer for serious students of European political and military history leading up to WWI. Dr. Fleming was an Emeritus Professor of International Relations at Vanderbilt University. He gears this book for history majors and readers with a deep and thorough knowledge of the convoluted politics, military rivalries and intertwining royal relations of the era.This reader found the discussion of President Wilson's inability to overcome Republican opposition to US membership in the League of Nations very informative. This was another example of the long history of isolationist sentiment that permeated US society for many years.To be honest general reader may find Barbara Tuchman's "The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914' and "The Guns of August" more accessable and easier to comprehend.

"We may find that there are, in actuality. no universal laws, that the universe may operate on pure randomness, or worst. from Special Delivery p9 of the hardbound editionSpecial Deliverance (1982) by Clifford D. Simak (1904-88) is a novel that severely tilts toward the allegorical.Professor Edward Lansing is "transported" to an alternate Earth by a talking slot machine. In a tavern he meets up with five other shanghaied travelers from other alternate Earths: a pompous military officer, an excessively pious minister, a lady poet, a female engineer and a strange robot. They begin a quest to find some meaning to their predicament. They pass a blue cube, an abandoned, decayed city and a singing tower. A strange beast trails them. It becomes apparent that the quest is a sinister and unforgiving test to select individuals for what is eventually revealed as admittance to the next level of galactic society.I enjoyed the book and I suspect Simak fans will appreciate the philosphical banter among the travelers. Mr. Simak is an author worthy of study but if this is your first exposure I hope you are not disappointed.After it's initial 1982 publication in hardbound and paperback this title has never been reprinted in the United States.

Howard Fast (1914-2003) was a celebrated and controversial American writer who, upon occasion, wrote science-fiction stories. 'The General Zapped an Angel",first published in 1969, is a collection of 8 stories - seven of which had never been previously published. The exception is the story " The Mouse" which was featured in the November 1969 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.In this reader's oppinion a science-fiction short story that keeps your interest and shows a commendable a degree of originality and creativity is a rare commodity indeed. The fact that the stories in this collection meet my subjective criteria is a detail I find quite amazing. I would go so far to say that this relatively slim volume would be an excellent text for anyone foolish enough to aspire to write short fiction.-The Mouse: Just what would happen if aliens infused a common field mouse with intelligence - and then left him as an abandoned experiment?-"The Wound": Using atomic weapons to release underground oil deposits may disturb more than sand and gas.-"The Movie": Some folks find reel life more real that, well, real life.-"The Mohawk": A Mohawk Indian parks himself in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral for some deep meditation much to the consternation of the local parish priest.-"The Insects": Our friends the bugs start broadcasting a disturbing message "You must stop killing us".-"The Vision of Milty Boil": A very short, extremely wealthy contractor keeps building vast high rise apartment buildings with lower and lower ceiling heights.-"Tomorrow's Wall Street Journal": Would you like a copy...well the Devil will give you one for a price.-"The General Zapped an Angel": One day in Vietnam a US General shot one of God's angles from a helicopter gun ship and then...-"The Interval": If our earthly landscape was one big elaborate movie set what would happen when the show was over?

The Earth Tripper by Leo P. KelleyThis amusing book proves the point that even the most overused and shopworn science-fiction theme if given a fresh slant and populated with out of the ordinary characters can result in a enjoyable story. This tale of an alien from another planet masquerading as an earthman in order to observe our culture and traditions is the case in point of this novel.We are presented with a "rebellious student" from another galaxy that strikes out on his own to explore earth's societies. The publisher and the author were, I suppose, trading upon the then - 1974 - stereotyped image of hippy students hence the dated title "The Earth Tripper". I can only surmise that the author's choice for a title might of been something very different based upon the story.Tock Von, an alien in human form, decided to reveal his true identity, which only results in skepticism and derision. Imposing home world logic he proceeded to free all the animals in the Central park Zoo and locks up all the human staff and visitors. Meanwhile he is parading around naked proclaiming his origin from another galaxy. This results in his admittance into an experimental mental hospital for "hard nuts" to cure that is. The book concludes with a somewhat conventional ending as Tock Von lead a group of patients in a rebellion against the staff.Overall I found this novel to be a very entertaining take-off on a familiar science-fiction theme. Certainly not a classic but a pleasant afternoon read from a little known author.Mr. Leo P. Kelley (1928-2002) wrote a total of nine science-fiction novels, which were all published during the period 1967-74. None of his novels were ever-reprinted so interested readers will need to troll for his titles in those specialized web sites dealing in used, out of print books.

This is Robert Silverberg is top form, in my opinion one of his most entertaining and thoughtful books.Lew Nichols is in the business of making political forecast based upon polls, computer simulations and intuitive gifts. He is not a soothsayer or a fortune-teller but a perceptive interpreter of trends and statistical sampling polls. He joins the campaign committee for the mayoralty of New York City. His candidate, Paul Quinn, not only wins big but also draws Lew to the font of power that he finds irritable. Groundwork is laid for a presidential bid with Lew feeding the Quinn campaign a choice of political alternatives and scenarios.Lew Nichols makes the acquaintance of Martin Carvajal who has true clairvoyant ability. Regrettable for Nichols Carvajal demonstrates that the future is preordained and this hazardous knowledge leads to despair and misery.The book is set in 1999 and was first published in 1976. In this light the author's views of the governance of New York City and its decadence is very interesting.

An objective review the US Army's combat role during the Viet-Nam War will surface uncomfortable facts that many people would rather ignore or wish were not true. The Army's mission was not to capture and hold territory or conquer a country but to inflict sufficient damage to the enemy forces to deter it from opposing the US supported regime in Saigon. The confounding reality was that the "enemy" was impossible to tell apart from the vast rural population of South Viet-Nam and that our combat operations disrupted and demoralized the semi-feudal society we proclaimed that we were defending. Even ardent supports of the war have to ruefully admit that the regime we installed in Saigon was rift with corruption and that the Communist claims that the poor would be better off joining the Viet-Cong had the ring of truth. In short order the enemy ranks swelled with "VC" nighttime combatants that by day were indistinguishable from the rural farmers and villagers.Those soldiers at the point of the US combat spear were ill prepared for the role they were expected to play in this facet of the global Cold-War confrontation between East and West. The vast majority were young draftees honestly fulfilling their military obligation. The 8 to 12 week training they were given and the equipment they were issued was geared for land war in Europe against a uniformed enemy - not in a tropical jungle were the enemy and the locals were impossible to tell apart. A twelve-month tour insured that any lessons learned were lost, as FNG's replaced those with hard-earned survival experience. Six-month duty tours for officer's insured that skilled leadership would be another essential commodity always in short supply.Our soldiers soon learned that the enemy was a master in the arts of camouflage and home made booby traps. Captured enemy villages or bunkers, paid with a hefty blood price, were quickly abandoned and soon reverted to the enemy. Exhortations to win the hearts and minds of the locals rang hollow when loading body bags of comrades killed by the sons of the village elders who recently swore allegiance to Saigon.Colonel Hackworth was assigned to command a unit with the one of highest causality rates in the Army. The battalion was full of rebellious soldiers - angry with the Army - whose only desire was to complete their tour of duty. Hackworth describes in this book how the low moral, poor leadership and a feeling of hopelessness played into the enemies strength resulting in careless troops ignoring basic combat skills and blundering into ambushes and booby traps. The author acknowledges the wretched circumstance of our involvement in Viet Nam. That situation was way beyond his pay grade.Upon assuming command Col. Hackworth instituted what would someday be called a tough love agenda. He clearly and forcefully told the troops that their goal of surviving their tour depended solely upon becoming a mean, hardnosed, combat efficient unit. They would through single-minded attention to jungle fighting skills inflict such a hurt on the enemy that Charlie would avoid tangling with them.Do not look to closely in this book for angry denouncements of the futility of our efforts in Viet Nam. I have a shelf of those books to sell you. This is an essentially heartbreaking but gripping story of how a man helped those he commanded survive in a lousy war by killing the enemy with murderous efficiency.

"Our Children's Children" (1974) by Clifford Simak is a story that attempts to fuse several over used science fiction tropes into something new and different. What results is a meandering tale with the distinct feel that it had been hastily contrived, with a truncated ending.Alien invaders have overcome our children's children some 500 years into the future. These aliens are very nasty. How nasty you ask, well, they love to kill, are super fast, breed like rats and eat people...nasty. Our peace loving progeny decide to evacuate their entire population of 2 billion, via time tunnels back to our time. ("How do you do, we are from your future escaping man eating aliens, do mind if we move in? Here is a bag of diamonds for your trouble.") Well, some aliens slip back along with the humans to our time. This unfortunate event keeps the story line lumbering along.The narrative is told from the perspective of the White House press office. This gives the author several opportunities to introduce us to various newspaper types. Actually these are the most interesting characters in the book. It's no surprise considering Simak's press background. There are several conferences with the President and his advisers that attempt to comprehend 'the big picture' and what to do about it...ho-hum. There are a few chapters with plot threads that read as it they could have been edited out the story with none the wiser. The "love story" plot line is so sappy I had trouble reading it with a straight face. The whole concept of time-travel, multiple "time tracks" going back and forward in time and the discussion of alternative universes is so unconvincing it reads like ragtime.It is noteworthy for Simak devotees that this story does not take place in the bucolic environs of southwest Wisconsin or near the Twins Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul but in Washington D.C.This 1974 story is still modestly entertaining and thankfully a quick read. It was first published in IF science fiction magazine (1973). It was last published in the U.S. in 1983 as a DAW paperback with a nifty Frank Kelly Freas cover.The author used the identical time travel concept [resettling Earth's population into the far past] in his 1978 novel "Mastodonia".

In 1961 Gordon R. Dickson wrote a very entertaining novel titled "Spacial Delivery". The narrative of that story concerned the planet Dildia an "earth-type" world that is an object of diplomatic contention for both the humans and their space faring adversaries the Hamnoids. Unfortunately Dildia is inhabited by fully intelligent beings, the bear like Dilbians. This results in elaborate protocols being enforced preventing the introduction of technology or direct interference in the local economy or governing bodies. Both the humans and the Hamnoids employ diplomatic skullduggery and various intrigues in order to curry favor with the Dilbians in order to obtain trading rights.In 1969 author Dickson returned to Dildia with his novel "Spacepaw". Since I read both book in quick succession I was familiar the "Spacial Delivery" plot. I was very disappointed that "Spacepaw" utilized almost the identical story line. The names have been changed but the plot is almost a carbon copy. I am not refering to the backdrop landscape summarized in the above paragraph but the actual story.Interestingly the page count for "Spacepaw" is 258 while "Spacial Delivery" was 138. The extra pages just add more fluff to a story that was told better the first time.My recommendation is to skip "Spacepaw" and read "Spacial Delivery" or read them both and you decide.

"The completeness of the destruction and the apparent methodical manner in which it was carried out indicate an unreasoning rage and a fine-honed fanaticism...Armed with incalculable engines of destruction, the major powers of that olden day possessed the capability to annihilate one another. This however did not come about. From all indications the collapse of civilization came about because of an outrage on the part of what must have been a substantial portion of the populace against the kind of world that technology has created." from "A Heritage of Stars".In "A Heritage of Stars"(1977) author Simak uses an extensive quotation from a long deceased historians text to postulates a future years after "The Collapse" of technological civilization. I was very impressed by the certain tenor of Simak's prose in these introductory passages used to introduce us to the place, time, location and atmosphere where the story takes place. The author's choice of words captures significant nuances of meaning that encourages one to appreciate the story he desires to tell us.Mankind has regressed back to the Stone Age from the space age in a few hundred years. It would be easy to just write about a war or a plague that derailed mankind progress and then jump into the story. Many a SF author has used, truthfully overused, that story device as many readers of this type literature are, I'm sure, acquainted. Simak's historian details in six pages how "perhaps five-hundred years ago, Earth was possessed of an intricate and sophisticated technological civilization. Of this nothing operational remains. The machines and the technology were destroyed, perhaps in a few months' time".The story that unfolds is engaging but fairly routine: a quest to find a remnant of man's technology - the fabled "Place of Going to the Stars". Our protagonist, the spunky, self assured Tom Cushing transverses though the Mid-West (in fact the journey starts and returns to Minneapolis-St Paul Simak's home territory). Along the way Cushing acquires a menagerie of fellow travelers: an elderly witch who questions her skills and her docile horse with very peculiar talents; the last upright robots who has overcome the prohibition to take life and now is a fearless bear hunter, and a man who converses with flowers and trees and his very strange grand daughter.It seems apparent to this reader that Simak wanted to convey to us some deeply held concepts about our current society and some dangers he perceived. Without becoming a shrill alarmists he presents this fascinating and engaging story. We can then mull over and decide if we "buy-in" to his world view. Buy-in or not the story told and the method of the telling make this a highly recommended book.

Oswald's Tale - Norman Mailer - Audio Book versionThere are very little editorial comments in this program. Except for introductory passages like, "the following was taken from the Warren Commission report on such and such date" the author is reading extensive quotes from historical sources which could by very dull, but in truth they are not. In fact this listener found the material fascinating. Approximately half of the program details Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union and subsequent life and marriage. This in conveyed to the reader by quotes from Oswald's diary, letters and transcripts of KBG bugging of his apartment. Using Warren Commission quotes we are walked through his life back in the USA up throught his murder by Jack Ruby. I can only conclude that Oswald was a very troubled young man to say the least!I was 18 and in the military when Kennedy was shot and remember it well. I have a laymen's knowledge of the sequence of events and know some of the controversy surrounding the Warren Commission findings. If you are, like this lisitner, not an expert on this topic you may find this program very informative and thought provoking. I appreciate the fact that Mailer does not take a position on the smoldering controversies that continue to this day. I found this audio book a compelling listening experience.These comments are for the Random House Audio Book version Oswald's Tale by Norman Mailer. The product copyright is 1995. The audio book consists of 4 numbered cassettes housed in the paperback book sized cardboard holder typical for these type items. The program is six hours long and is an abridgement from the printed version. The readers are Norman Mailer and his wife Norris Church Mailer.Both do a credible job with the material, speak clearly and are easily understood.In case you are concerned about the useful life of audiotapes these cassettes are approximately 17 years old as of 2012 and played flawlessly.

"My race is an ancient one...long before there was such a thing as human being...we had built a great civilization...we could have fashioned for ourselves a way of life beyond anything even we ourselves could imagine...facing a decision...we would not live for ourselves alone but for the other intelligence that might evolve throughout the galaxy," Mister," Jones said harshly, "I know your kind...do-gooders who make it their business to interfere with others". from "Enchanted Pilgrimage""Enchanted Pilgrimage"(1975) is a fantasy novel by Clifford Simak - a writer know primary for his science fiction. The story, while imaginative in parts, employs traditional fantasy tropes: an idealistic quest, magical beings, mystical artifacts, a virginal damsel and several apparent insurmountable obstacles blocking the completion of the journey. Author Simak keeps the action moving to its uninspiring conclusion. It was somewhat disconcerting to see a few science-fiction touches thrown in to propel the plot when things seem to bog down.Our hero, human Mark Cornwall, purloins an ancient document from the university library. Upon studying the tome Mark is inspired to travel to the Wasteland and discover there a purported Elder civilization. If you have read much fantasy you will not find anything new here: a magic swords saves the day, cryptic unexplained evils need to be dealt with, a unicorn's horn in the hands of a virgin proves very helpful, a godly hermit gives deathbed instructions and inspirations and a man from an alternative Earth shows up on a motor bike with a machine gun and a camera. Honestly that's is in the book - how absurd!Simak fans should read this book, others looking for a good fantasy novel may want to consider something else. I would suggest Lovecraft's "At the Mountain of Madness" or books by A. Merritt or Moorcock's Elric saga.

"Outpost of Jupiter" by Lester Del ReyThis interplanetary space adventure novel first published in 1963 has not aged very well. The story concerns a couple of teenagers residing on the moon Ganymede, combating a plague and making contact with beings from Jupiter. The last time this book was republished was in 1982.Author Del Rel (1915-93) add credability to an otherwise absurd tale with his expertise in medical research procedures and plausible descriptions of time-consuming and dangerous space travel. His realistic images of the struggling space colony and the near impossible logistics of obtaining life-sustaining provisions also adds to the modest enjoyment of this book.Adults may wish that Del Rey speculated in greater detail on the nuts and bolts of living in an isolated colony on one of Jupiter's moons. Alas, the juvenile market, for which this book was written, necessitated the insertion of several incredible challenges for our resourceful teenage boys "Bob" and "Red" to resolve.Mr. Del Rey authored a number of interplantary space adventure for younger readers: "Battle on Mercury"; "Mysterious Planet"; "Rocket Jockey" and "Marooned on Mars". Interested readers looking for these types of stories may be better served by seeking out books in a similar vein by Isaac Asimov (1920-92) and Robert Heinlein (1907-88).

"And now, Elric had told three lies. The first concerned his cousin Yyrkoon. The second concerned the Black Sword. The third concerned Cymoril. And upon those three lies was Elric's destiny to be built, for it is only about things which concern us most profoundly that we lie clearly and with profound conviction." Michael Moorcock, The Elric Saga Book 1Elric the last sovereign of Melnibone and the dreaming city Imrryr of the Dragon Isles is despondent and uneasy with his role as ruler. In order to fulfill his obligations he must practice and relish the cruel and decadent pleasures of the court. In addition he is an Albino addicted to certain drugs to sustained and maintain his strength. Prince Yyrkoon, Elric's cousin, plots for his death so he may assume the Ruby throne. Utilizing risky sorceries Elric avoids death at sea and returns to the Dragon Isles to confront the usurper. Prince Yyrkoon is forewarned and escapes taking Cymoril, his sister and Elric's Queen to be, into hiding in the young kingdoms. Elric peruses Yyrkoon and obtains the nefarious rune sword Stormbringer, the Black Sword, which starts his slow but inevitable spiral downward. A mesmerizing story, compelling characters, lots of dark undertones, fantasy at it's best.The publishing history of this book may be of some interest to potential or curious readers. In 1972 Lancer issued an edited paperback edition of this story titled "The Dreaming City". The editing was done without Mr. Moorcock's approval. Subsequently the authors approved text was published under the title "Elric of Melnibone" by DAW in 1976.There are eight books in the Elric saga; "The Dreaming City/Elric of Melnibone" is book 1.On a personal note the Elric stories are a favorite of mine and I recommend them to any reader when enjoys fantasy literature.

The following comments are for the short novel House of Iszm.To be frank this novel is not one of Jack Vance's better efforts. It was written in the 1950's, published by Ace and reads like a modest first draft in need of revisions.The author constructs a detailed framework to hang an uninteresting tale of inter-planet stratagems. What really exasperating are the possibilities inherent in the plot that are not developed.The saga is pure space opera; two planets vie to control a third to increase wealth and power. One of the planets is dominated in it's physical and religious aspect by an enormous tree; an idea ripe with possibilities that is discarded after a few tantalizing paragraphs. Fortunately for the reader Vance's extraordinary imagination shines through in spots preventing this book from being a total loss.Fans of Vance should read these early novels to appreciate the maturity in later books. Casual readers should look to later works; this story will disappoint.

"So the robots came out here and established their Vatican. They based it upon an Earth religion that had a deep appeal to them-not so much because of its teaching. Rather, I would suspect, because they admired its organization, its hierarchy, its long tradition, its dogma.' from Project PopeIn "Project Pope" author Simak grants himself an expansive canvas to ruminate on two of his most compelling themes: artificiality created human beings and the search for a collective truth that overshadows the universe. The fact that both topics are so intimately intertwined in this story, and successfully so I may add, makes this a seminal novel in the Simak collected works.Approximately one thousand years ago a group of robots decided to leave Earth and begin a systematic search for the Truth. One major motivation for this Exodus was that created human replicates were not allowed to participate in Christian worship since, after all, they had no soul and, therefore, could not be saved and achieve heaven. The robots deliberately ferreted out a remote and isolated Earth-like world where the plans for Vatician-17 could be nurtured without undo curiosity and interference. Yes, Vatican 17 since is a short aside we are informed, "At the time this establishment was built there may have been sixteen other Vaticians through as many solar systems settled by humankind, although as to that I cannot be positive".The search for a collective truth that would validate the efforts of Vatican-17 is supplemented by human "Sensitives" recruited to seek out interstellar awareness of the beliefs of alien beings. This information, recorded on memory cubes, is used to expand the database employed by the robotic Vatican. It is a discovery made by one of the Sensitives that brings the story to a crisis point.Some of the most intriguing aspects of this story are the methodical ways the author creates a sympathetic and rational robotic religion and the tension that develops between the "Sensitives" and more conservative robots that long for faith over truth.Now, aside from the philosophical discussions concerning the search for an ultimate truth and the evolution of robotic religiosity there is an intensely layered narrative tension in this story that propelled this reader to keep turning the pages long into the night.It would be unfair to conclude this favorable review without one negative observation. This reader found the ending, the last twenty pages or so, completely out of sync with the thoughtful and gripping narrative developed in the prior 290 pages. Nonetheless this book is abundant with compelling and imaginative speculations on the future. It strongly suggests that the author's intent was to convey some sincerely held conjectures within the context of a science-fiction novel. A very thoughtful, and at time reflective story that should be reprinted - or at least made as an e-book- and enjoyed be a new generation of readers.In my oppinion one of Simak's better novels up there with "Time and Again" and "Way Station".

The following comments are for the unabridged audio book version of "Inventing a Nation". Of particular interest is a fascinating afterword spoken by author Gore Vidal. In this relatively short book, I noted that the page count of the print version is 198; Gore Vidal attempts to place his literary arms around the efforts of those three principal actors in our early national drama Washington, Adams and Jefferson. This is by all accounts a book of non-fiction but I find his style very similar to his fictional prose - extremely fascinating and sometimes very frustrating. That comment is based upon my limited reading of his historical fiction: "Burr", "1876" and "Lincoln". Trust Vidal to highlight some the historical oddities that can challenge our uninformed assumptions:Washington gallantly waiver his salary as commander of the Continental Army but after the war submitted his bill for personal expenses of $100,000.Our bloody enemies, the mercenary Hessians, married local girls Western Pa and Delaware hence the many German family names found in those areas.Vidal broaches the rumor the Hamilton was Washington's illegitimate son. After all GW did visit the Bahamas once.The anti-Catholic Pope-hating Yankee Protestants thought an invasion of Canada in 1776, let by the redoubtable Benedict Arnold, would be a resounding success. After all would not the Popish Frenchmen rally around the New Englanders against the British oppressors?Vidal has a keen facility for discerning the eccentricity of human nature. His insightful observations breath life into the Founding Fathers. A fascinating read or listen, recommended.

Tales From Planet Earth by Arthur C. ClarkeArthur C. Clarke (1917-2008) was an extremely talented writer. My oppinion is based upon my reading of many of his novels. In fact his novels - "Sand of Mars", "Childhood End", "Rendezvous with RAMA" and others are one of his many claims to fame. I was not aware just how talented a short stories writer he was until I read this collection. Short stories, novels you say is there is a distinction? I belief there is. The short story form, done well, is a challenge that few science fiction authors have mastered with the consistency of Mr. Clarke.Each of the stories in this collection engages the reader within the first couple of paragraphs. Although many of the tales were written over 50 years ago they retain a timeless quality. What comes across in these stories is a writer bursting with ideas and concepts while retaining a solid grounding in our common humanity. I found many of the story themes and resolutions gripping and insightful.If you are new to Clarke's short fiction this collection will prove to be an excellent introduction.A few words about the book itself are in order. The 1990 trade paperback edition I read - Bantam Spectra ISBN 0-553-34883-3 is the only U.S. paperback edition. The book features a very humorous introduction by Isaac Asimov. Each of the 14 stories has an author's introduction detailing the publishing history and an interesting anecdote or observation about the story subject. If you are a fan of classic science fiction art you will be pleases to note the each story is accompanied by a full-page illustration by Michael Whelan who also created the wonderful wrap around cover for this edition.An excellent book in a lovingly crafted edition what more could a SF fan desire.

The Goblin Tower is book one in a fantasy trilogy titled "The Reluctant King" by the very talented writer L. Sprague de Camp (1907-2000) Since these "Reluctant King" books (The Goblin Tower, The Clocks of Iraz and The Unbeheaded King) have been long out of print readers may be reluctant from purchasing this volume since the other volumes may be unavailable. Nonetheless this book is, in my estimation, a very enjoyable reading experience that can stand-alone from the other two books.De Camp presents the reader with an outlandish whopper of a tall tale as justification for the actions and adventures of his characters. "A curious custom", said the barbarian, "to cut off your kings head every five years". Yes, but true. In Xylar City the custom was that, willing or not, the king has his head chopped off, and then the ghastly thing tossed into the crowd who had assembled to watched the ghoulish spectacle. The unlucky clod who catches or get hit by it is, well, he is the next king! Our protagonist Jorian was in the wrong place at the wrong time and ended up king. His background consists of failed accomplishments and bungled apprenticeships. His only real talent is as a storyteller, which as the plot unwinds is put to very good use.As the title of the series implies the kings, while enjoying the perks of office, are not too happy about their retirement package and attempt to escape what fate has in store for them. To prevent "reluctant kings" from missing their date with the executioner the court advisors employ a special legion of royal guards.King Jorian, who with the help of a bungling magician saves his neck from a very close encounter with an ax and confounds the kingdom's monarchial succession arrangements.Jorian's supernatural getaway just as the ax was swung comes with a price. A cabal of magicians requires an "ancient coffer called the Kist of Avlen, said to be filled with portentous spells from olden times". Jorian is charged with a supernatural curse that drives his to fetch the Kist of Avlen no matter to obstacle - therefore our story.Fantasy tales of this type are chock full of the standard rudiments: wizards, fantastical beings, a quest, seemingly insurmountable obstacles and the miraculous escapes. De Camp's considerable imanigation and wit, his versatility with language and word choice were greatly admired by this reader. What made this story extraordinary was the author's use of stories within the story told by Jorian to entertain guest at a reception, make a point or to cozy up to his captors. These 5 to 6 page long tales interspaced throughout "The Goblin Tower" are gems, and while not related to the plot add a sense of realism to the imaginary landscape and culture de Camp wants us to travel in.

This first hand account views the Vietnam War from the perspective of a medical doctor. John Parrish did not want to go to Viet Nam -who in his right mind would - but like millions of others he answered his draft call and performed his service to the best of his abilities.Doctors who were drafted for Vietnam received brief and perfunctory military training. This accelerated the movement of physicians to the very hectic and demanding field hospitals where their services were in great demand. Dr. Parrish describes in graphic and heart rendering details, the sights and sounds of wounded soldiers. He worked in a forward hospital so his unit received the injured right from the jungle battlefield. As the stretchers were brought in from the helicopters his task was to make an immediate assessment of the injured: some were stabilized and sent out to better equipped facilities; some were rushed into surgery and some were tragically beyond help and set aside to die.Dr. Parrish ruminated with his hooch mates about the absurdity of attempting to win the hearts and minds of a rural population held in contempt by the ruling clique in Saigon and more in sympathy with there Northern brothers. His oppinions are sharpened by experiences during sick calls in local villages. Much to his consternation he realizes that most of the medications being handed is being collected by the Viet Cong or taken by the ARVAN.The title of this books refers to a method used by medical corpsmen to alert the doctor's of the medical status and the number of incoming causalities: walking wounded, stretcher cases and dead. This proved to be practical shorthand in the pandemonium of a front line aid station of hospital unit.Dr. Parrish and his co-workers are constantly referring to the calendar countdown to the end of their 12-month tour of duty. It is with some surprise that the book abruptly ends prior to his leaving Viet Nam. The book begs for a postscript.I find that first hand accounts of military service in Viet-Nam facilitates my comprehension and appreciation for the difficult circumstances the war imposed on the soldiers. In addition to this excellent book other that I have read and would recommend are: "From Classrooms to Claymores" by Ches Schneider; "Time Heals No Wounds" by Jack Leninger and a favorite of mine "West Dickens Avenue" by John Colbert.

These comments concern the novel "Gods of Riverworld" by Philip Jose Farmer (1918-2009).Last year I finally was able to read the four Riverworld books in sequence something I have been meaning to do for quite some time. The books titles and year of first publication are as follows: "To Your Scattered Bodies Go" (1971), "The Fabulous Riverboat"(1971), "The Dark Design"(1977) and "The Magic Labyrinth"(1980). I was motivated sufficiently to post comments on each book here on Amazon.Speculative fiction aficionados and admires of Philip Jose Farmer's writings should consider reading theses intriguing books. Having said that I must be honest. I was disappointed with the conclusion. After four books Farmer leaves the reader dangling on a narriative cliff and then as a final shove informed us that "The Magic Labyrinth" would be the final book in the series. Well, authors can change their minds and this brings us to the "true" final volume "Gods of Riverworld" published in 1983. Perhaps not, wouldn't it be like Farmer to have his estate publish a "lost" volume found in his papers. We can only wish.First a word of caution. If you have not read any of the Riverworld" books you should do you self a favor and at least read "To Your Scattered Bodies Go" prior to "Gods of Riverworld" you have been warned."Gods of Riverworld" takes up at the conclusion of "The Magic Labyrinth". The story starts with an apparent murder and the survivors in the tower set out to find the guilty party. Farmer drops that plot thread until the end of the book and instead spends the next several hundred pages with lively intellectual conjectures and speculations concerning the nature of our souls, resurrection, afterlife, good and evil and an incredible replay of Alice in Wonderland with homicidal robots playing all the characters.For this reader the attraction of the Riverworld books is the thought provoking concepts the author proposes and the very obvious portions where the novel turns into autobiography.In my humble opinion this series will eventually be Farmer's true lasting literary legacy. Although I do greatly admire "Jesus of Mars" and his non-genre "Fire and the Night" the Riverworld" books are the first titles I would recommend to a new reader.

Across The Borderline - Willie Nelson - Music CDThis 1993 released CD was produced by Don Was and features Willie Nelson in collaboration with a number of musical luminaries; most notable Paul Simon and Bob Dylan.I have had the privilege to attend two of his concerts and have a sincere appreciation of Mr. Nelsons singing talents. To be frank I am not a great fan of joint "sing-along" type albums but I did purchase this CD because I am also an admirer of Paul Simon and Bob Dylan. My conclusion, and it is purely subjective, is that I would have preferred that Nelson sang alone on this album. The other artists that contributed their musical talents make this a worthwhile CD for the Nelson fan.

Jeb Stuart Magruder was a minor official in the Nixon White House and a player in the Watergate scandal. In 1974 his book "An American Life - One Man's Road to Watergate" was published. Reading it over 35 years later I was struck by the apparent objectivity of his opinions and observations. I was expected a very guarded self-serving - cover your backside - tract written in lawyer language. Instead he apparently felt that all his Watergate transgressions were already public knowledge so there was nothing to be gained by parsing the truth.He admitted he lost his moral compass in his efforts to serve the goals as set down by the President. Although there is no justification for committing a crime anyone who has worked in an organization must ruefully acknowledge that there is a strong tendency to "do whatever it takes" to prove you worth and value to that organization.I would recommend this book for several reasons:Magruder is a good writer. He kept my interest with his candid observations of the diverse individuals he worked with and descriptions of his White House re-election campaign duties.The first 55 pages are a biography with emphasis on his various political campaign activities, family and jobs descriptions. This could be very dull but his life story is interesting considering where he ended up - in jail.The author admits he was not one of the central players in the Watergate fiasco. Nonetheless he did have a good seat to observe and his comments are helpful to understand Watergate and the subsequent cover-up.A couple of items of passing interest for those considering reading this book:Mr. McGruder was named after his father's favorite civil War general but is not related. He is related to John Bankhead Magruder who served as one of Robert E. Lee's generals.McGruder includes several reprints of internal White House guidelines he was given as a new employee.Magruder's first major political job was managing the successful 1962 primary campaign of Donald Rumsfeld for the Republican nomination, preparing for the congressional election in the 13th district of Illinois, to the United States House of Representatives. Rumsfeld subsequently won the congressional election.

The approach of the millennium provided ripe fodder for cranks, news organizations and science fiction writers.Silverberg's premise is right out of SF101: on Christmas Day1999, in Rome, a man descends from the sky and claims to be from the future. He states he wants to observe us and to take the equivalents of a Middle Age's Grand Tour of out civilizations.Silverberg plays fair in that the reactions are consistent with plausible actuality: skeptics dismiss Vron-19, as he calls himself, as a outright charlatan while a growing segment of the population hails him as a religious figure sent to herald the new Century and the end of the world. Others don't know what to think.The U.S. Government invites Vrom to tour the country accompanied by "guides" who are in reality scientific experts. These CIA-types attempt to extract information and to ascertain if Vrom is a fraud or what. The government encourages belief in Vrom to counteract waves of hedonistic self-destruction by cults preaching doomsday at the end of the century.Thankfully Silverberg skips over the "lurid descriptions of riots and orgies in the streets" for thoughtful dialogs between the science-types and Vrom. At the end we are still left with the question is Vrom a fake or a true time traveler.Robert Silverberg book "The Mask of Time" was a thoughtful and exciting "what if" novel set in 1999. For fans of Silverberg it is well worth reading. The casual readers of science fiction may want to pass because of its "dated" theme.

The concept of time travel, one of the most conventional of science fiction themes, has been used and abused by numerous authors over many years. Truthfully I find these stories very challenging to take seriously. This book is no exception but the author's formidable knowledge of history, geography and religion does keeps the action moving along quite agreeably so you don't mull over the inherent absurdity of time travel and all it's related conundrums.Author Brunner gives time travel an interesting twist in these three related and connected stories. The Spanish Armada defeated the English fleet in 1588 resulting in the conquest England. Now fast forward 400 years we have North America as a Spanish possession being exploited for natural resources and Catholic Dons ruling England. Somewhat incomprehensible with the discovery of time-travel is that no technology has evolved from what existed in the 16th Century. Travel is by horse drawn coaches and telecommunications are non-existent.Brunner's attention-grabbing `alternate history" concept, participation by priests and Popes in the administration of the Society of Time and a sub-plot involving American Indian tribes did kept my interest on a superficial level.Just to keep the record straight you should know the evolution of this title because it gives an insight into how authors can "fix-up" their stories for future sales. On the copywrite page to this book we are informed that shorter and substantially different versions of the three sections of this novel were published as three separate stories in British SF magazines. Then the three sections, with numerous minor alterations were published in 1962 by Ace as part of a "double novel" under the current title Time Without Number. The 1969 version, the edition reviewed, had been completely revised and considerable expanded. The page count the 1962 Ace edition was 139 and the 1969 Ace edition 156. This is not uncommon for Brunner. Many of his earlier books are expanded from magazine stories and from prior editions.

Fellowship of the Talisman - Clifford D. Simak"I have longed all my life to be a soldier for the Lord...a holy zeal burned, perhaps not to brightly, in my breast, but at least it burned. I tried many things to prove my devotion. For years I sat staring at a candle flame...at times I nodded and singed my eyebrows on the candle's flame"...chapter 7"Fellowship of the Talisman", published in 1978, is a fantasy themed novel written by Clifford D. Simak (1904-88).This story takes place on an alternate earth that is similar to our earth except that no technological development has taken place - as the book introduction states "the Dark Ages has never ended". Although the setting is England in the 20th century we might as well be back in the 1500's. The reason for this lack of progress is attributed to "the Evil" a malignancy that occurs every five hundred years which for reasons not stated retards human progress.Our hero, Duncan Standish, is charged with a quest by his father the Lord of the manor, and by the local archbishop to deliver an ancient manuscript to a certain scholar at Oxford. The document could be irrefutable proof of the actual existence of Jesus. If verified it is surmised mankind would flock to the Church and "The Evil" could be overcome and humanity would resume its progress. Unfortunately the route to Oxford must pass throught areas controlled by the current infection of "The Evil". Duncan acquires an entourage of fantasy companions consisting of a hermit, a ghost, an imp, a harpy, a goblin and a woman related to a wizard.My short description of the plot may lead one to dismiss this book as a ludicrous fantasy. I found it very entertaining with the bonus of several very interesting theological discussions with the imps, witches and the holy hermit. Readers of Simak will not be surprised since religion; evil, and mankind's destiny play pivotal roles in many of his novels.For readers with a particular interest in the Simak novels I should inform you that many of the usual and customary elements he employs are missing in this story. There are no robots, lyrical passages extolling the wonders of nature, references to newsmen, newspapers, and as noted the location is not SW Wisconsin or the area around Minneapolis-St. Paul.The basic plotting of this story has a lot in common with his novel "Enchanted Pilgrimage" (1975). Both books concern a reluctant hero charged with a mission who acquires a gaggle of phenomenal beings as they overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to complete their quest.Author Simak wrote 26 novels three of which can be fairly classified as "fantasy" while the remainder are science fiction. In addition to the book under discussion other two are "Enchanted Pilgrimage" (1975) and "Where Evil Dwells" (1982). I know I'm on "thin ice" skating between the realm of science fiction and fantasy particularly with an author like Simak since some of his other novels have a mix of fantasy and science fiction elements. What you say, gentle readers?

Darkover Landfall by Marion Zimmer Bradley"In the stress and dangers of the crash-landing no one except the Third Officer had gotten a clear look at the planet from space, and she had died twenty minutes after impact. They knew that this planet was what was called a Class M planet - roughly Earth-type and probably habitable. The red sun, the four moons, the extremes of temperature, the mountains all had been discovered in the frantic intervals of digging out and identifying the dead and setting up hasty shelters while the ship was still inhabitable." from p6 "Darkover Landfall" by Marion Zimmer Bradley.I have had an abiding admiration for well-written, scientifically credible fiction novels that describe expeditions to the stars and the discovery, exploration or colonization of habitable planets. I presume you could call this a guilty pleasure, but nonetheless these stories still resonate with me to this day after over 50 years as a fan. Certainly there are many common elements, or conventions in these stories - the author must persuade the reader of the plausibility that life could survive, that the ecology, gravity, oxygen content, weather, solar radiation, climate, etc will be within reasonable bounds for humans and that the reason for the expedition and methods of travel have some credability. Finally and most importantly the author must provide an engrossing story line with characters and emotions that resonate with the readers.I am very pleased to state the Ms Bradley book "Darkover Landfall" is a success by all the criteria that I deem these types of stories must possess. In fact, this novel excels in all categories and I recommended it without reservations.An noted below this novel is the first of a series of books concerning the planet "Darkover". To the credit of the author and the editors this book can be enjoyed "as is" that is it can stand-alone. Certainly there are discoveries and mysteries aplenty but this particular story does not contain any cliffhangers that would force you to seek out other volumes for "answers".Of interest is the fact that the name "Darkover" is never mentioned in the text. Something to do with the fact that other books in the series were written prior to this book but the events in those book took place much later...it get very complicated!Marion Zimmer Bradley (1930-99) wrote seventeen "Darkover" novels and eight addition novels in collaboration with other authors. "Darkover Landfall"(copyright 1972) is, according to the ISFDB (Internet Science Fiction Database) the first novel in series although it was not the first written as far a copyright date in concerned. Fans and readers that may wish to parse this very interesting and readable series should consult the ISFDB and the WIKI article on Ms Bradley. In addition a Google search will located some excellent fan sites concerning "Darkover".One final word: Thank you Marion for sharing your wonderful stories with us.

Farmer in the Sky by Robert A. HeinleinIf you are a devotee of Robert A. Heinlein (1907-88) and enjoy science fiction novels with lucid extrapolations of the near future then "Farmer In The Sky" should be on your "must read" list.Overpopulation pressures induce the more adventurous, or more reckless families of Earth's teeming cities to apply for homesteads on the Terraformed Jupiter moon Ganymede. As Heinlein would state in another novel (Farnham's Freehold) TNSTAAFL - "Their Not Such Thing As A Free Lunch". Each homesteader-farmer must pledge several years of crops and labor to repay his passage and use of farm tools - the land is free.Heinlein deftly handles the narrative detailing the fear and uncertainty within the Lerner household as they leave the security of Earth for the life of a pioneer. His descriptions of the homestead activities on an alien world are engrossing.My only complaint, and a minor one at that, was the introduction of an "alien artifact" to give, I suppose, the story a real 1950's SF zing.This novel, although written for the teen market in 1950, can be enjoyed by readers of all ages.

These comments are for the classical music CD set "The Ultimate Tchaikovsky". The set consist of 5 CD's and was released in 2007 by Decca Music Group.Each CD is housed in a standard sized jewel box with the contents listed on the inside sleeve and the backing paper insert. Content listings include track titles, artist and track time. The total disk playtime is only listed on the inside jewel box sleeve and on the back of the storage box. There is no commentary or notes included with this set or with any of the Decca "Ultimate" sets for that matter. I regret that this is the case since I usually find this information very useful and informative. The five CD's come packaged in a snug fitting cardboard box, which is practical for storage and handling.I am not a musician or musical scholar. I do enjoy listening to classical music and the works of Tchaikovsky have always been a favorite of mine. In my opinion these are excellent recording of many of his well know works. I found two recordings of particularly exceptional: CD1 "Piano Concerto No. 1" with Edo de Waart conducting the Rotterdam Philharmonic and CD 2 "1812 Overture" with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, Vladimir Ashkenazy conductor.Decca has released several of these "The Ultimate" five CD sets. The Ultimate Tchaikovsky is my eight set. The physical design of the other sets is identical to the description give in this review. My assumption is that a reputable label like Decca issuing sets titled "The Ultimate" would only select recording from their library judged to be outstanding examples of that artist works. I have not been disappointed.I find the "Ultimate" sets an economical way to become familiar with some wonderful and timeless music. The quality of the recordings and the bargain price make these sets well worth purchasing for the classical music enthusiast.

The Magic Labyrinth (1980) is the forth "Riverworld" novel by author Philip Jose Farmer. The other three books are To Your Scattered Bodies Go (1971), The Fabulous Riverboat (1971) and The Dark Design (1977). For individuals who are contemplating reading this novel without reading the other three in the series I can only say you will be disappointed and somewhat confused. It is an investment in time and, yes money, to acquire and read the previous three books. If your are an admirer of Farmer's writings or just someone with a desire to become acquainted with one of the most intriguing concepts in science fiction your investments will be worthwhile.I will not attempt to summarize the plot - there are many better reviewers here on Amazon who can do that better that I. Also sometimes a detailed plot summary can spoil the sense of discovery and wonder that is one of the higher rewards of reading science fiction.I will state that I have been reading fantasy and science fiction for over 50 years and in my estimation this series ranks among the best the field has every produced. No it's not perfect by any means. Farmer can, well, describe something in 20 pages when 10 would do just fine. At times his Riverworld books read like first drafts than need to be edited. Nonetheless, if you sign on the Riverboat he will draw you into this world and open your mind to ideas and concepts that will resonate with you for a long time.

The novel "Dinosaur Beach" by Keith Laumer (1925-93) was first published in a much shorter version in Analog magazine in 1969.As a long time reader of science fiction I must confess that time travel stories are my least favorite. There is no way for the author to paper over the impossibility and improbability of traveling thru time, changing the past and/or 'seeing" the future. Our only hope is to ignore the "how" and enjoy the adventure.This novel is, to be kind, not very good. In fact it was a chore to finish. Laumer conception of "time-travel" is absurd, and the convoluted plot, such as it is, just blunders and stumbles to a very lame conclusion.This reader has the distinct impression the author slap-dashed together disjointed paragraphs, incomplete ideas and dull plot elements until he filled just enough pages to expand the magazine story to required book length. What resulted is a "novel" 151 pages in length with many chapters that end half way down the page, large fonts and chapter headings that fill that top third of a page. At least this padding reduced the mind-dulling verbiage.I cannot recommend this book to anyone except a die-hard Laumer fan. You have been warned.

"Slaves of the Masterery" is the second volume in the Wind On Fire trilogy. If you are hesitating reading this book because you have not read volume 1 "The Wind Singer" do not be overly concerned. "Slaves of the Mastery" can be enjoyed without having read volume 1. I would recommend that, eventually, you do read "The Wind Singer" since it is a startling wonderful story and the Hath family is featured prominently in both books.This story takes place approximately seven years after the events detailed in "The Wind Singer". Life in the town of Aramanth has taken a decidedly turn for the better after the Hath children restored the "key" to the Wind Singer statue. We are not informed exactly how restoring the key almost instantaneously transformed the entire town from an excessively stratified society to one where everyone seems to mix and mingle like one big happy family.Good times never last in fiction or real life. For the inhabitants of Aramanth the party is definitely over. An army of warriors sacks the town, burns it and then enslaves all living inhabitants except for Kestrel, one of the Hath twins. The story resolves what happened to the captives, the motivation of Masterery leader and the spiritual and leadership growth of the Hath family. We are introduced to talking animals, an order of monastic hermits and a strong dash of mind reading and supernormal powers.Author Nicholson has a real talent for detailing the love, tensions and conflicts within a family. These family relationships permeate this story and spark our interest and motivated the narrative. The allegorical foundations and spiritual allusions also kept this reader interested.

I finished this book about ten days prior to writing these comments and observations. I needed this time to let my thought mature - my wife would say fester - since I had so many "guilty pleasures" reading the book. Here I am well past 60 reading a children's fantasy and I was blown away.It is rare when I get emotionally involved with fiction characters but I did. The quest of the Hath twins Kestrel and Bowman and their odd friend Mumpo to find the key to engage a musical and magical artifact "The Wing Singer" sound like a fairly routine fantasy story line. The charm here is the emotional interaction between the three principals. The author has breathed live into the Hath twins. This life originates from the close loving Hath family that plays important roles in this story.The author does a very credible job creating a place alien. Everything is just a little odd and out of kilter. I was not overcome with a feeling of strangeness but in the book it was a subtle ambiance that permeated everything.Be counseled the author is serving up a hefty measure of arcane symbolism and metaphors in this deceptively straightforward story. It is very possibly why I enjoyed it so much.

Gilbert and Sullivan - Highlights - Telarc CDI have always considered that many of the Gilbert and Sullivan signature songs were very energetic, rousing and toe tapping. I found this Telarc collection of 28 selections exactly to my taste. These songs are from five different musical productions and were recorded during the period 1991-95.I cannot speak as to the technical aspects of this version contrasted to other collections nor can I ruminate upon this male or that female singer as compared to another. To be forthright I am not knowledgeable of these topics. I will just say I found this album very engaging and on that basis recommend it if you are in the market for a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan songs.I would suggest you turn up the volume, adjust the base and treble and be prepared to be entertained.

The River of Doubt - Candice MillardThis book chronicles the Roosevelt-Rondon expedition down the Rio da Duvida - River of Doubt - that began February 27, 1914. I was not unfarmiliar with the details of this river journey having just completed listening to the unabridged version Edmund Morris book "Colonel Roosevelt". Actually the Morris book aroused my curiosity to learn more about Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Father Zahn, Kermit Roosevelt, TR and the other distinguish members of this expedition and the deadly challenges they had to overcome.I do not intend to summaries the startling events and multitude of tribulations that were encounter by the explorers. After all discovering these events for the first time is one of the purest pleasures of reading a fascinating non-fiction book.I will comment on a couple of aspects of this book that I found of particular interest.One of the many pleasures of this book is the narrative style employed by the author. From the first page you are drawn into this story and the pages fly by.It would be no exaggerate to state the flora; fauna, geographic conditions and the climate assaulted the expedition. The author alternates detailing the group's progress, with short dissertations on the hostile natural environment they had to contend with. The author's clear narrative style made her discussions of the complex geological and biological adaptations easy to comprehend for this lay reader.At the end of the book the author provides a short biographical sketch detailing the lives of the principals after the completion of the expedition. I found this very interesting particularly the long and fulfilling life led by Rondon and tragic circumstance of Kermit Roosevelt's post expedition existence.This is an exception book and well deserves the many "Best Book of the Year" accolades it has received.

The Secret Service by Philip H. MelansonI have always assumed that the United States Secret Services only responsibility was the safety of the President, his family and other certain top government officials. Further more I had assumed that this was always the case since the founding of the Service. After reading author Melanson's informative book I soon found that I was wrong on both counts.President Lincoln founded the Secret Service in April 1965 as the "Secret Service Division" of the Department of the Treasury with its only mission to suppressing counterfeiting. This was a major problem during the Civil War. It was estimated that a third to a half of all currency in circulation in the 1860's was bogus. The Secret Service continues to be the agency responsible for curbing counterfeiting and arresting "coney men" as they were called in the later half of the 19th Century.Around 1900 the Secret Service started providing limited security for the President. How this came about and the resistance of Congress to allow this new duty is one of the very interesting stories covered in this book.The author goes into great detail evaluating the role of the Service during the Kennedy assassination. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to acknowledge that there were serious miscalculations. Of interest to this reader is the summary of all subsequent attempts on the Presidents life.The author provides considerable details concerning the training, recruiting and history of the Service. This book is not the last word on the subject but provides a handy overview for the interested reader.

Clockwork Pirates is a weak novel, but as a satire of SF and Fantasy it has a number of telling points.John Wesley Sand is a freelance gumshoe that is hired by the provincial governor on a planet in the Barnum System to recover his daughter who has been kidnapped by mechanical pirates. Mechanical pirates, well now that should be a tip off of some sort. With this breathtaking narrative hook firmly implanted the reader now embarks on THE QUEST. This allows the author to pad the story with useless plot meanderings disguised as "action" and "adventure" sequences that makes little or no contribution to the plot. As we approach THE END Mr. Goulart resolves a sticky issue by informing us that a wizard's attractive daughter just appeared with the jail house keys and the reliable invisibility cloaks both extremely helpfully for a climatic escape -what a girl!Mr. Goulart has presented for our amusement several forms of spurious and artificial plot devices and incorporated them into his storyline. What results, surprisingly, is a fluffy but enjoyable reading experience. If, perchance the reader is less that pleased just flip the Ace Double novel over for another, and hopefully, more entertaining tale.

"Why Call Them Back from Heaven" by Clifford Simak"Why Call Them Back from Heaven" (1967) concerns a near future where individuals are placed in suspended animation with the promise that they will be reborn when medical science can assure them of a prolonged life - that is, life everlasting. Simak's future is very bleak. Individuals are fitted with death notification devices that alert monitors to quickly bring the deceased to the Forever Centers for internment. The punishment for crimes against the state is removal of the transmitters. Citizens live frugally in order to accumulate wealth, usually in the form of Forever Center investments, in order to assure themselves financial resources when they are revived since, after all, they will be living forever. The plot is propelled by the search for a missing document that may reveal unfortunate truths about the whole concept of the Forever Centers.Admittedly suspended animation is not a very origional plot concept and the desperate search for a document is not a very exciting idea. What make this an intriguing book is the investigation and ponderings by the characters of the spiritual ramifications of the concept of eternal life in our present corporal state. Our religions assure us that after our short existence here on Earth in this "vale of tears" we will have eternal life with the Creator in a heavenly realm. What would happen to our religious beliefs and concepts of God if mankind could assure himself of earthly, eternal life? Simak does not provide any pat answers. His characters ruminate and speculate and we readers are invited to do the same. This concept of a supreme being and man's place in the universe is a reoccurring theme in many of Simak's novels and is one of the guilty pleasures I use to justify reading his fiction. I would recommend to interested readers Simak novels titled: "A Choice of Gods"-"Project Pope" and "Way Station".It is regrettable that the last printing of this book was in 1988. A generation of fantasy and science fiction fans haven't had the opportunity to read this extraordinary story unless, like myself, they ferret a copy off the Internet.Who should read this book? Well, for starters anyone who admires the writing of Clifford Simak and individuals with a curiosity about the effects of technology on religious faith. This is an aspect of speculative fiction that greatly interests this reader.

This short story collection by John Brunner features 10 tales all originally publish in various science-fiction magazines during the 1960's.According to the ISFDB- Internet Speculative Fiction Data Base - the 1973 Dell paperback is the only edition published. The themes of overpopulation and ecological disaster are featured in some of these stories. Years later Brunner would use these themes in several novels to great critical success: "Stand on Zanzibar" and "The Sheep Look Up" for example.It is very unfortunate that this excellent introduction to the speculative fiction of John Brunner has never been reprinted. There is an introduction by the author concerning his apprehension for the future written in a humorous vein.

JFK and Vietnam by John M. NewmanIn order to get ones academic hands around the issue of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War you must scrutinize the actions, statements and decisions of three Presidents: Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. Certainly Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Truman all had some dealings with Vietnam but direct military involvement draws us back to the later three individuals.Mr. Newman's 1992 book is, in my opinion, absolutely essential reading for anyone desiring awareness of the U.S.-Vietnam military involvement during the Kennedy administration 1961-3. The book is an objective overview of the diplomatic maneuvers and military shenanigans that took place on Kennedy's watch. This is a seminal work and Mr. Newman's research is evident on every page. I was particularly impressed with the extensive notes that were placed - not at the end of the book - but after each chapter. I found this very helpful since I was constantly checking citations and noted several books I wished to add to my "want list". In addition to the impressive notes the following listings are included that enhance the usefulness of this volume: acronyms, biography of key persons, glossary, chronology, bibliography and index. The subtitle of this book is "Deception, Intrigue, and the Struggle for Power" and indeed it was.A good case has been made that Kennedy had no intention to ever become trapped in a Asian land war. This is in spite of the hawkish advice and consul he was receiving from his national security advisor, Mac Bundy and the Joint Chiefs. Some memoirs by Kennedy insiders have stated the if he had not been assassinated all "military advisors" would of been withdrawn upon his re-election in 1964 and the Vietnam War would never have occurred. The author makes this point convincingly and it is hard to refute.

These comments are for the Naxos CD of music composed by the Philip Glass consisting of "The Light"(1987) and "Heroes Symphony"(1996). The recordings were made in 2006 by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra under the direct of Marin Alsop.As a long time admirer of Philip Glass I will be the first to admit that some of his works are not accessable to new listeners. I contend that the fault, if in fact it is a fault, rest with the listener. That is not the case with this CD. Both works will, I believe, appeal to individuals wishing to acquire knowledge of this composers intriguing style.

The Clash - Super Black Market ClashThis 1980 released CD came with a sticker on the outside of the jewel case - it stated "Over 77 Minutes of Music" - "2 Previously Unreleased Tracks" - 10 Tracks never before available on CD". I usually avoid these "complete you collection" type albums. I'm always suspicious that these are the songs the creative band members deemed "not good enough" for album release. Now that the band is broken up the suits decide to put out this collection of left overs in order to make a few bucks from the masses.Quite the contrary, this is a very good album and deserves a place in your "Clash" collection. No, there is no particularly dazzling song but the overall musical quality and variety of instrumentation is outstanding. When I state " variety of instrumentation" I mean that almost every song features a delightful instrument: gong, whistle, harp, organ, cymbals etc. - what a talented band "The Clash" were!This hour plus CD will provide you with some excellent company on a long car trip.

The novel "The Sinful Ones" has a convoluted history that has been documented by the author in an afterword to the 1980 Pocket paperback edition. The story was written in 1943 but was not published until 1950 in the science fiction magazine "Fantastic Adventures". The original title was "You Are Not Alone" and ran about 75 pages in the magazine. Leiber reworked and expanded the story and it was published in a paperback as "The Sinful Ones". My paperback edition was 170 pages a significant expansion of the original version. Not having the shorter version to compare I'm can only state my oppinion of the full up novel.I found "The Sinful Ones" by Fritz Leiber (1910-1992) uninteresting, convoluted and stuffed with unnecessary dialog and descriptive passages that contributed little to the story line. Perhaps "psychological thrillers" with supernatural overtones was a hot topic in the 1950's but I could not buy in to the author's viewpoint. Perhaps it was the fact that until page 93 we, the readers, were finally let in on the BIG MYSTERY which was frankly quite an anticlimax.As a long time reader of science fiction I was pleased to read this very early effort by Fritz Leiber. Nonetheless I would not recommend it to new readers unfamiliar with his major works.

Books detailing the wheeling and dealing that takes place during the selection of presidential candidates can make for absorbing reading. This book is no exception. 1940 was an election year and compelling historical events and political trends exerted an overriding influence on the selection of the major parties candidates. The proceedings described in Mr. Peter's book take place in an era - pre WW2 - well before our current presidential primary system relegated the major party conventions to coronations of pre selected candidates.Germany was overrunning Europe and England was pleading for military aid. A strong isolationist sentiment in the country and in the congress tempered President Roosevelt's ability to respond. Although he was still popular Roosevelt knew that political traditions and a strong anti-war sentiments weighed against his seeking a third term. If the Republicans selected an isolationist as the standard bearer in the Fall election any Democrat candidate with pro-British leanings would be in serious trouble.The selection of Wendell Willkie as the Republican candidate at the party convention in Philadelphia was one of those subtle pivot points in American history.Willkie was as unlikely a person as one could imagine becoming the 1940 Republican Party dark-horse candidate. He was a man who had never held elective office, was a recent convert to the Republican Party and had been an active participant at previous Democratic Party conventions that had nominated his 1940 election opponent Franklin Roosevelt. More importantly he was a man who supported the reinstatement of the military draft and acknowledged that Hitler had to be opposed - positions not held by the other Republicans seeking the nomination. With Willkie as his opponent Roosevelt choose to "allow" himself to be drafted at the Democratic Convention and proceeded to find ways to aid the British with material support.The author, Charles Peters, enlivens the text with his personal memories of the political and cultural events of 1940's.

My edition of this novel, Pyramid, fifth printing- July 1971 - states on the top of the front cover " One of the greatest science fiction novels ever written!' Well, I have to disagree. I found this book dull and a chore to read to the last page. In my opinion Sturgeon disregarded the narrative contract with the reader [creating characters you care about and a story line that keeps you turning the pages] in order to present his BIG IDEA. I have no problem with BIG IDEA books, science fiction bookcases are full of them, but the "greatest" have been entertaining. In 1960's I recall that this book was considered "very adult" in the small insulated SF community of that time. But the passage of almost fifty years has relegated this book to the level of an oddity - a footnote in the literature. Sturgeon [1918-85) was a gifted writer, sadly overlooked by reprint publishers. Most of his books are out of print but thanks to Amazon you can still pick up copies of More that Human, Case and the Dreamer, Sturgeon In Orbit, Sturgeon Is Alive and Beyond at reasonable prices. I have read these titles and recommend them as an introduction to this very fine writer but I don't recommend Venus Plus X.

"There are no facts other than two very simple ones and the first of these is that fifty years ago the greater fraction of the human race either went somewhere or was taken somewhere...The second fact: our lives are much longer now." from A Choice of GodsA Choice of GodsClifford Simak's novel "A Choice of Gods" is a compelling story filled with intriguing characters and startling concepts. The author asks us "what if you woke up and found that 8 billion inhabitants of earth disappeared without a trace or without any hint of where they went." It turns out that you and a few companions and all the robots were all that was left. You also discover that your life expectance has extended into the thousands of years.The first obstacle that this author, or any science-fiction author for that matter, must overcome is to encourage us, perhaps even seduce us, to shelve our sense of incredulity and buy in to his extraordinary concepts. Yes, concepts in the plural since Simak's story is brimming with ideas, side stories and astonishing personalities that ripple out from his first inspiration. Utilizing a cache of narrative techniques - numerous readings from a journal, plausible revelations of events, seriousness of purpose, persistent speculations concerning destiny and careful, unwavering expositions we are drawn in, let me say again seduced into this disconcerting future.It would be uncharitable to disclose specific plot twists or essential character particulars. The event of first discovery is one of the guilty pleasures of reading and who am I to deny one a dollop of literary bliss!

This is a bewildering book to comprehend let alone comment upon. It combines arcane mysticism, autobiographic asides and a convoluted, almost incomprehensible plot. Needless to say I liked it and would recommend it to readers who, perhaps, have read some of Dick's earlier works and dismissed him as a shallow hack.In my opinion the "Divine Invasion" is a borderline novel heavily layered with the author's theological conjectures. I found the mixing of metaphysical digressions, almost mini-essays, salted within the story narrative to be facinating - even if some of his observations were inscrutable. His theology is a passionate gumbo of Christianity and Jewish mysticism. It is sure to disconcert the true believer and baffle the rest of us.Many of the story's plot fundamentals just don't make sense. This seems to be a characteristic of many of Dick's later novels. I suspect the author is ridiculing the conventions imposed upon him by editors when he was writing "hard" science fiction stories early in his career.Dick includes several digressions that are purely of an autobiographical nature. Like his character Herb Asher, Dick had a troubled marriage, worked in a record store, liked classical music, audio equipment, heard voices and saw visions. It would be unwise to speculate what Dick's mental or emotional state was when he wrote this book. Although I occasionally felt like I was reading notes from a therapy journal.At times one has the sense that Dick used this book to work out his personal conjectures regarding End Times, the Second Coming and the conflict between Good and Evil. Near the end of the book Elias, Herb Asher's business partner in the music store tells Herb, "Maybe you have a message to deliver to the world from God." Perhaps Phil Dick was an imperfect messanger.

If I Die in a Combat Zone Box Me Up and Ship Me Home - Tim O'BrienStudents of the Viet Nam War will soon realize that books detailing first person accounts of in country military service are very numerous. I have read several of these and find them a refreshing remedy to the memoirs of generals and politicians. Each type of book certainly has it's place in our attempts to come to grips with the tangle of Viet Nam. Nonetheless the personal experience of young soldiers elicits for this reader a myriad of disconcerting thoughts regarding misguided patriotism and unmitigated heroism.The author shares his deep reservations concerning Viet Nam and warfare in general. He ruminates about the values instilled by a small Minnesota town upbringing contrasted with the possible necessity of taken a persons life in a foreign country for a doubtful objective. After some misgivings he answers his draft notice. After basic training and assurance that his billet will be Viet Nam his qualms resurface. During AMT (Advanced Military Training) he makes elaborated plans to escape to Canada. Be warned the author's introspection is a recurrent theme in this book so if you're looking for nonstop combat accounts you may be disappointed.Tim ended up in Viet Nam and volunteered for one of the two most dangerous jobs in a rifle platoons that of radio operator - the other being the "point" man. OK he was in the rear but what a target. The enemy knows that taking out the radioman was key to preventing air and artillery support and as a bonus the officers are always near by.The author has an admirable skill in detailing the absurdities inherent in our futile crusade in that sad country. Mr. O'Brien has written, in my opinion, one of the better Viet Nam books of this type.

The prolific English writer E. C. Tubb (1919-) is the author of 140 novels. He is noted for his 33 book science-fiction series the Dumarest Saga. It is quite remarkable to consider that this series began in 1967 with "The Winds of Gath" and the latest volume was published in 2008. It was reported that author Tubb died in October 2010.As a lifelong reader of science fiction I am chagrin to admit I had, prior to this title under review, never read one of Mr. Tubbs books. To be honest I have been reading science fiction since 1958 and have spent too many evening plowing through some very boring books.I approached this novel with some trepidation. After all it was written in 1967 and I was prepared for another pulp era potboiler full of stock characters mouthing space jargon like it was Holy Writ. I found this story and the series concept extraordinarily interesting and a joy to read. I can honestly say this was the first science fiction book in many years I could not put down and read it in a day.I will forgo detailing the intricate plot of this novel until I can provide potential readers some general impressions that resonated with this "newbie" to the Dumarest community. Some of my initial observations have been updated after reading several volumes in the series.Tubb's universe consist of hundreds (thousands?) of inhabited "earth-type" planets - to be more precise planets able to support human beings with a temperate zone, acceptable gravity, protection from solar radiation, absences of deadly microbes, and a breathable atmospheres. We are told these planets are scattered over an extensive volume of space. Interesting to this reader there are no "intelligent" beings, yes, numerous plants and animals that play important roles in each story but no extra terrestrial beings. This removes one of the irritating crutches most authors rely upon to spice up, and for many carry their plots. Tubb's future envisions mankind settling on habitual worlds and developing societies with technology spread via a sporadic influx of visitors using conventional space travel. The settlers on these worlds must adapt to the local conditions and, out of necessity exploit them to prosper and in some cases just to endure. The planet GATH survives by becoming a tourist destination. HIVE is managed by a syndicate of feudal houses that exports a useful drug extracted from bee-like creatures. On FOLGONE the settlers strictly ration access to a highly desired live extending enterprise. Toy is a decadent world where technology is employed to create perverted baubles for the jaded ruling class called stockholders.Tubb envisions a far future of autonomous planetary cultures resembling feudal city-states with a thin veneer of technology jealously confined to the ruling elites. The majority of the planetary population is usually exploited to support the ruling clique. There is no "Federation of the Planet" or "Rulers of the Universe" or even a code of ethics. Once settled on a planet the inhabitants are for all intended purposes at the mercy of the local boss, dictator, matriarch or despot. Most societies are semi-feudal with a clear delineation between the haves and the have-nots. Travel between planets is restricted to the wealthy due to the high cost of traveling safely. A small group of space vagabonds and some desperate individuals can travel cheaper but must subject themselves to the risk of traveling frozen with a 15% death rate.The hero of the book, "Earl Dumarest" is a Solider of Fortune, resourceful, perceptive, compassionate, wise and a man on a mission. His travels have a purpose; he wants information, clues, and rumors concerning his birth planet Earth so he can return. Just exactly why he must return is never adequately explained in the first 15 volumes of the series that I have read so far. Earl is not very introspective. He just tell people he is looking for Earth and wants to return there no matter what. To be honest this is a weakness in the logic of the story line but I am hopeful that by the time I reach book 33 it will be resolved.The PROBLEM with Earl achieving his goal is that the distance between planets are so vast, travel takes so long and the number of inhabitant worlds so numerous that "Earth" is unknown to most people or is shrugged off at a myth or urban legend of the space ways. He suspects some malice intent to keep the concept of Earth a topic not worthy of discussion by intelligent and refined individuals. As we soon learn the Cyclan community is behind the effort to discredit the concept of a "home' planet of mankind. In the books Dumarest travels from world to world surviving on his wits and physical skill while seeking out tantalizing hints concerning Earth.The author has Dumarest travel to a new planet -in some cases planets - as he continues his quest. Interestingly the issue of just "how" the ship travels between the vast distanced between inhabited planetary systems is not discussed. This is all for the good as far as this reader is concerned. Tubb avoids the spurious jargon about "hyper-drives" and "warping through the space-time continuum". Hey, the folks get on the ship and then it arrives, that's good enough. Let the reader assume whatever his wants as far as to the "how". It is stated that the voyages are FTL - faster-than-light - speed and Dumarest ruminates that due to his extensive travels he would be centuries old. Some passengers make the space voyages in a drug induced "fast" state where they mentally experience a substantially shorter elapsed time. For a much lower fee some passengers agree to be put in a suspended "frozen" state called "slow". We are informed the about 15% of travelers in "slow" die during space voyages.Tubb populates this series of books with some very interesting factions that structure the series since they appear in each story. There are the Cyclan, a group of emotionally neutered persons of high intelligence employed as advisors to the ruling families. The Cyclan have a "dark secret" and subtly oppose Dumarest's search for Earth. On the other hand The Brotherhood of the Universal Church a humanitarian organization whose "monks" roam the galaxy giving comfort and alleviating suffering wherever they can. The monks seem to know about "Earth" and assist Dumarest in very subtle ways. The Hausia and a informal syndicate of traders and deal makers that use insiders knowledge of a planet's commerce to acquire wealth and influence.ESP - extra sensory perception, mind reading, and clairvoyance, what ever you call it plays a role in these stories. Alien insects and small animals appear to have rudimentary powers to alert each other to danger. One human character, Derai, could read minds, which resulted in efforts by the Cyclan to use her mysterious talents for their perverted ends. Usually the introduction of "espers" into a story can be a problem for the readers. Hey, any time the plot bogs down the author can "see' what the other guys are thinking and the story moves along. So far Tubb has been judicious in his use of this plot-ruining device.I am convinced that the more effort an author put into creating a planet with an alien ambiance and inferred dangers, the more appealing his story will be to the SF reading public. Tubb, bless him, works hard at this and the extradinorary readability and fascination of his stories are the result.One of Earl Dumarest most admirable traits is his compassion. He goes out of his way to help someone in need even when it appears to be a futile effort. In "Toyman" a young man has a gut wound and is delirious. Earl is low on water and is in an isolated location. His healthy companion - the voice of reason - tells him not to waste the precious water since without medical attention the lad will die shortly. Dumarest acknowledges the truth of the statement but share the water anyways. The man does die, but compassion won over cynicism. These 'acts of compassion" by Earl is laced throughout the novels. I find this aspect of his character very commendable and interesting in the furtherance of the story line.One of the intriguing pleasures of "The Winds of Gath" was the riveting plot. Tubb has that rare knack to pace the story in such a way to make you anticpate to "just what the heck is going to happen next" and the pages keep turning. We are on the planet Gath a tourist world with mysterious crystallized rock formations that during the periodic 'storm time" resonate sonically such as to cause disturbing visions and hallucinations. Dumarest did not book passage to Gath but the ship was diverted to satisfy the needs of the wealthy Matriarch of Kund. Gath is devoid of employment opportunities that Dumarest requires earning passage on another ship. He becomes very involved in a plot to prevent the abduction of the successor to the Matriarch. We learn very quickly the outwardly impartial counsel provided by the Cyclan is a ploy to secure power and control for unspecified malevolent ends. Dumarest earns passage to another planet by assisting the Matriarch. Certainly the story is a "space opera' and hints and clues and given to entice the readers to read on. The fact is that it is done with great style and class.Tubb's style of writing is very economical. These books are not 800 pages doorstops. "Winds of Garth clocked in at 121 pages and I see that the next book "Derai" is a slim 116 pages. No fluff just sharp dialog and cracking action that propels the extremely well devised plot to its conclusion.It is very apparent that my delight with the ""Dumarest Saga" is not an solitary event. A search of the Internet will show several informative sites devoted to the series.These comments were revised and expanded on the following dates: 8-27-2010, 11-14-2010

A Maze of Stars, published in 1991, was the next to last of the 53 science fiction novels written by John Brunner 1934-95. Having read most of his novels I can opine that it is one of his best space-exploration themed stories. The fact is that most of Brunner's novels utilize the subject matter of planetary exploration as a backdrop for his tales. Surprisingly after plowing the same field many times Brunner, near the end of his life and career, was able to invigorate this theme with a unique perspective, sympathetic characters and fascinating planetary societies. To be candid I sometimes found his earlier works unimagitive and generic of the type published by other authors. I was very gratified that he was able to infuse so much imaginative creativity into this novel.The main character is the Ship. So large it cannot land, the Ship was designed to travel the "Arm of Stars" (presumably an spiral arm of our galaxy) and seed humanity on planets likely to support life. When the story begins we are informed that six hundred planets have been seeded with human stock over a five hundred year voyage. The Ship, as part of its program, surreptitiously revisits the seeded planets to observe how the experiment is progressing.Brunner employed a non-liner narrative method in this novel. Many short narratives describing the successes or failures of the humans "seeded" by the Ship take up the story line. The narratives are small gems in themselves. In a few pages Brunner details credible societies, emotions and ecological challenges and as sense of "otherworldliness'" that were lacking in many of his other full-length novels. The Ship cements theses story segments with observations and commentary while all along it is slowly questioning its ultimate goals. During the voyage the Ship rescues three different individuals for relocation to another world. As expected these folks dialog with the Ship and we learn some of the methodology used by the Ship to achieve its goals.Brunner avoids subjecting us to the easy crutch employed by most science fiction authors: intelligent, sentential, aliens good, evil or indifferent. You wont find any in this book. Humanity is alone and must contend with alien microbes, chemistry, flora and fauna but no BEM's. (Bug eyed monsters)I highly recommend this book because for this reader it rekindled the "sense of wonder and adventure" that is one of the private pleasures of reading.

This review is for the CD - compact disk - boxed set titled "Gustav Mahler - The Complete Symphonies - Leonard Bernstein" issued by Sony Classical.This boxed set consists of 12 compact disks each housed in a sturdy cardboard sleeve. Each sleeve features an image of Mr. Bernstein on the front and a track listing on the back. The track times are not listed on the sleeves.A 66 page CD size booklet is part of the set. This booklet has a complete disk, track and recording data listing. Noteworthy is a reprint of a very insightful article on Mahler by Mr. Bernstein. Also included are English translations of the songs lyrics.The 12-sleeved disks and the booklet are stored in a sturdy hinged cardboard box. This box is very compact - about 2 and half inches high and fits nicely on your music shelf either upright or on the side since the contents identification is on all sides of the box. On the box bottom is a summary of the contents of each CD. This is a well-designed boxed set!Of interest to this listener is that not all the recordings were made with the New York Philharmonic. Symphony No. 8 "Symphony of a Thousand" was recorded with the London Symphony orchestra and on Disk 10 Kindertotenlieder was recorded with the Israel Philharmonic.I am not a musician or a music scholar. I do enjoy Mahler and have several of his symphonies by other conductors in my collection. I have listened to this collection several times and recommend these disks.

Philip Glass - Itaipu - Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and ChorusOver the years I have acquired 16 different recordings by Philip Glass. Therefore I have an approximate idea of what to expect musically since most, but not all, of his works are similar in composition. There are repetitive themes, soaring choruses and a cacophony of electronic/musical sounds. The CD "ITAIPU" meet my expectations and as such I enjoyed the audio experience.I have his recordings loaded into one of my Sony 300CD jukeboxes and about once a year play some random tracks until I'm sated. I would say his music is an acquired taste, one that I prefer.If you are an admirer of Mr. Glass you should seek out this modestly priced disk and add it to your collection.

In the Partheon of under appreciated American Revolutionary Heroes General Nathanael Green (1742-86) is in the first rank. Green was so highly regarded, that Washington once said that if he went down in battle, he was his choice to succeed him. Yet until recently Green has been largely forgotten. One reason for his obscurity has to do with the fact that his voluminous papers and correspondence has only recently been gathered and published. Author Golway acknowledges that without these newly published volumes he could not have written this recent biography published in 2010.Utilizing extensive quotes from Green's correspondence with family, business associates and military leaders including Washington, author Golway has written a very readable and informative biography.For the interested reader and determined students there are abundant literary avenues available to pursue a study of the American Revolutionary era; and there are certainly no shortages of books to choose from. The ploy is to determine how to approach this vast subject. I have found that a biography of Washington's generals satisfies my interests in the era's tactics, soldering skills, logistics and political gamesmanship. If your interest is similar I can recommend, in addition to the book under discussion, the following title I have read: "John Stark Maverick General" by Ben Z. Rose; "Henry Knox Visionary General of the American Revolution" by Mark Puls and "Benedict Arnold Patriot and Traitor" by Willard S. Randall.

Ark of Empire The American Frontier 1784-1803 Dale Van EveryThe exploration and settlement of the Eastern half of the eventual United States is a fascinating subject redolent with villains and idealist. Dale Van Every (1896-1976) wrote a very informative and thought provoking trilogy that describes this turbulent period. His focus is on the "West" - the West being that ill defined movable boundary offering open spaces to individuals and families who wagered everything for a homestead."Ark of Empire" details the witch's caldron that was the American frontier in 1784-1803. Indians and settlers were in a death struggle while English and Spanish agents provoked and prolonged the turmoil for their hidden goals. Appeals to the Government were ineffective to say the least. The author calls out James Wilkinson, a scoundrel of the first degree, for special notice.It does not appear likely that these books will be reprinted - what a shame since they tell an essential story of the elemental human forces that shaped out country. We can only hope they show up on Kindle some day. These books are essential readings for people interested in Native American issues, the settlement of the country and the incalculable cost paid in blood and treasure to be what we are as a country."Ark of Empire The American Frontier 1784-1803" is book 3 in Mr. Van Every's American Frontier trilogy. Ark of Empire was first published in 1963 and reprinted in 1987.Book 1 is titled "Forth to the Wilderness: The First American Frontier 1754-74" published in 1962 and 1987.Book 2 "A Company of Heroes; The First American Frontier 1775-83 published in 1963 and 1988.The volumes are not identified by the author or the published as Volume 1, 2 and 3. I added this to order the volumes for interested readers.

"Firesong" is the last volume in the Wind On Fire trilogy. In this book the Hath family, and a remnant of their countrymen who reluctantly join them, head off into the wilderness for the promised homeland. No one is sure just exactly where the homeland is except that it will be found "over the mountains" as foretold by the Hath prophetess and matriarch Ira.It's not easy being a prophet. Many folks think you're a fool and even some of your followers voice strong doubts about your sanity, leadership and the credibility of your prophecies. Kestrel, Ira's son, leads the way, never doubting that the words of the prophet are reliable. During the journey the expedition must overcome temptations in the form of the seven deadly sins.It is apparent that the author has integrated many biblical themes in these stories. To his credit the actions and motivations of the Haths "fit" the story; that is characters don't turn aside and telegraph a "message" out of context.I found the trilogy a captivating and enlighten story. The author has created a marvelous world rich in mystery but grounded in unsentimental love of family and of community.I kept re-reading the prayer for the dead used twice in "Firesong": "We who are left behind watch you on your way. The long prison of years unlocks its iron door. Go free now, into the beautiful land. Forgive us who suffer in this clouded land. Guide us and wait for us, as we wait for you. We will meet again." What an intriguing book - highly recommended.

I read this book on my Kindle and it became readily apparent that the lack of maps was a severe determent. Volumes 1 and 2 of the Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant describe his experiences in the Mexican and Civil War. Grant was a stickler for details. He includes every river, creek and stream crossed and town, villages and cities entered. Many of the names of waterways have changed and some towns no longer exist. I did resort to my trusty road atlas to find some Southern locations but without period maps it is easy to lose you way! I recall seeing a printed edition which included maps. The Kindle experience with this book was disappointing. Nonetheless I did glean an appreciation and admiration of Grant that I did not have before. His reputation as President has regrettable tarnished his sterling military record.The book is truly essential reading for serious students of the Civil War. Make sure you have an illustrated edition or a if you read the Kindle version keep a Civil War atlas handy.

These comments are for the Simon and Schuster Audio book of "Back Hawk Down" by Mark Bowden. This audio book consists of 4 audio cassettes with a playtime of 5 hours. Joe Morton reads the book with an introduction by author Bowden. Mr. Morton does an excellent job reading. He has the rare ability to convey terror and danger in a vocal presentation without hamming it up. He adds an almost breathless sense that you are right there in the middle of the action.The events of Sunday October 3, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia involving the U.S Army are tragic and heart breaking. Why we were there, what were the issues, who were the enemy, is nearly lost in the fog of time - and who would want to look in that rear view mirror anyways. Who today remembers or for that matter thinks about the issues that seem so meaningless in retrospect. The cold hard facts that will never fade were that 18 servicemen died and dozens more were badly injured. The story of what happened to those men is dramatically told in this presentation.

The following comments are for the abridged audio book version of "Time and Again" copyright 1995 by the author Jack Finney and publisher Simon and Schuster. The audio book consists of 4 cassette tapes and total run time of 4 and a half hours. Cambell Scott reads and is, in my estimation, an excellent choice for this dramatic narrative.I must say I found this a marvelously entertaining presentation that kept my interest from beginning to end. I usually find time travel tales difficult to swallow but author Finney does a commendable job keeping the story line tense and exciting and, thankfully, the time travel elements mostly off stage. The "time-travel" portion of the story takes place in New York City in the 1880's. The best part of this tale was the effort the author made to describe the look and feel of long ago New York City. His prose was very descriptive of what one would imagine how the people dressed, the buildings the lived and worked in, and the street views of lower Manhattan. One of the considerable charms of this audio book was inclusion of scraps of period music and appropiate sound effects that enhance the illusion that the characters, and we tag along readers, were back in time.I was disappointed it was an abridged version but, nonetheless, it was still a very entertaining way to spend a few hours stuck in traffic and commuting.

From Time To Time by Jack FinneyThese comments are for the abridged audio book version of this story.Several years ago I listened to the Jack Finney audio book version of his novel "Time and Again" read by Campbell Scott. It was an enjoyable listening experience. Just for the record this is a science-fiction tale concerning time-travel. The story kept my interest and the author had a very creative method of bringing to life what it must have been like living in New York City around the year 1900.When I found the sequel titled "From Time to Time" in an audio book section of a used bookstore I purchased it with anticipation of another enjoyable listening experience. I must report that the actual results were very disappointing. Perhaps it was a very poor job of abridgement but the story made no narrative sense whatsoever. Characters appear and disappear, events start and end with no coherent plot structure. I would suppose the actual book may be better but the audiocassette version was a disaster.

A Knock at Midnight - Inspirational from the Great Sermons of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.The following comments are for the Time Warner cassette audio book version of A Knock at Midnight. The material presented is the original recording of church sermons delivered by Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.The audio book consists of 6 standard tapes cassettes. Each cassette plays 90 minuets; 45 minuets per side. Although these are standard 45 minuets per side tapes the actual audio content length varies from tape to tape. For example Tape 1 side A is listed at 37 minuets so the last 8 minuets are blank. Each side consists of an introduction by an associated of MLK followed by the sermon. Unfortunately neither the dates of the sermons nor the locations are documented anywhere in this audio book.The packaging is as follows: on each tapes side is listed the audio length, person giving the introduction and the usual commercial labeling. Disconcertingly the title of the sermon is not shown on the tape but only on the audio book packaging. The tapes are housed in standard audiocassette plastic boxes. The six tape boxes slip into individual sleeves in a three-panel fold out box. There was no insert booklet. The packaging provides sturdy protection for the tapes and allows easy access.The issues date from this collection was 1998. I purchased my copy as a remainder in 2010 and it was "factory fresh" in every respect. To my delight the audio quality of the tapes after 14 years in storage were excellent.It is apparent that some of these sermons were recorded 20 to 30 years ago and the audio quality is not "studio perfect" but nonetheless the clarity and pronunciation and enunciation by MLK are adequately captured on these tapes. You will soon notice that that each sermon has gaps. This is because I assume someone's tape ran out and the reel has to be replaced. I remember well those old reel-to-reel machines.We tend to forget that MLK was first and foremost a preacher of the gospel in a branch of Christianly that elevated preaching to an art. His convictions and subsequent action grew out of his preaching tradition. This collection of his sermons is just amazing.

Several years ago I was alerted to this CD by a segment Scott Simon featured on the NPR radio program "Saturday Edition". I was so intrigued that I immediately ordered a copy throught Amazon. I am usually not an impulsive purchaser but the whole concept of the music creation and the startling exceptional renditions of old "war horse" songs - well, I could not resist. I was not disappointed.The whole concept sounds so bogus that to explain it is just lame - but here goes. In the mid 70's a music teacher, Hans Fenger, in a rural Canadian school district decided that he would start a project where the students would use improvised instruments, sing pop songs, record the songs and sell the LP recording to fawning parents and other students. Flash forward almost 30 years and the album with wonderful notes is issued on CD and....well, you have to listen to the songs. This also sounds lame, but there is just something wonderful and haunting about the music on this CD in the context of the time and place and methods of it's creation.

The science fiction novel "Brain Twister"(1959) concerns the use of ESP (extra sensory perception) by spies as a method to obtaining secret information concerning US rocket research. FBI agents are sent out to scour all mental hospitals for individuals with "odd" abilities. It is never adequately explained why the hospitalized mentally ill are the only repository for ESP talented individuals. The unstated premise is that you must be "crazy" to claim to possess or exhibit these talents. Yet the author(s) take great pains to describe government and industrial research into the phenomenon due to their belief that the Russians are using ESP to "peep" secrets from the West. One elderly lady "liberated" from a mental hospital believes she is the Queen of England and immortal. She insists that her G Men handlers and the doctors dress as Elizabethan courtiers and provide her with a replica of a queen's throne room - they comply with her request. I found this story a chore to finish and do not recommend it to anyone but diehard fans of Randall Garrett. Aside from some amusing dialog the story was outlandish and dragged along until the uninteresting and easy to figure out conclusion.The novel that eventually became "Brain Twister" was first published in a much-shortened version as a two-part serial in Astounding magazine for September and October 1959. The title in Astounding was "That Sweet Little Old Lady" by Randall Garrett and Laurence M. Janifer. What started out as a 62 page long magazine story balloned into a 144-page novel. Pyramid Books first published the novel in book form as a paperback in 1962 by Mark Phillips - a pseudonym for authors Garrett and Janifer. British publisher Carroll & Graf published a paperback edition in 1992 as "Brain Twister" by Randall Garrett and Laurence M. Janifer. In 2011 Resurrection Press published a trade edition of "Brain Twister" by Randall Garrett and Laurence Janifer. Readers interested in this title can download it for free from Project Gutenberg look under Mark Phillips.

Johnny Winter - Scorchin' BluesI had recently resurrected my collection of Johnny Winter CD's from storage and preceded to play this 1992 compilation recording. Talk about a blast from the past these concert recording date from 1971-79. If you are into blues, but need an exceptional Winter album, or just curious, this is as good a place to start as any. One big bonus to this CD is the very detailed and informative biographical sketch printed in the booklet.I never had the privilege of attending one of his concerts but this album gave me the taste of what it must of been like back then.I was very pleased to see that Mr. Winter, now a shade below 70 years old is still touring - Summer 2012 - play on good man!

The Viet-Nam conflict has produced a large number of books by generals, journalists, historians, critics and participants.I have read a number of these and find that, overall, those books written by the enlisted soldiers detailing their combat experiences to be the most riveting, informative and heartbreaking.The lowest common denominator in the Viet-Nam era U.S. military was the draftee infantry soldier. Eighteen year olds sifted out by a draft system tilted against minorities and poor white that weren't "smart enough" to get a deferment. This is where the true blood price was paid for the decisions made in Washington. I am very cognizant of the arguments made justifying our reasons for drawing the line in Vietnam; and believe that in the context of the times those decisions were justifiable. Nonetheless those decisions resulted in subjecting young, trusting and patriotic men to a dreadful trial by fire.West Dickens Avenue was a street sign the author found while stationed at Khe Sanh and was used to identify and personalize his foxhole. As a Marine "grunt" he lived in that named foxhole during the 77-day siege subjected to relentless rocket and mortar attacks. His telling of personal experiences during this period, what he saw, what he did, how he survived, and how other died is compelling reading. His personal photographs snap our attention to the authenticity of his forceful text.I don't claim any extraordinary awareness or comprehension of this war. I am not a Vietnam veteran or a historian. Authors present their version of reality for the reader to ponder. I have read this extraordinary book twice and wince at the telling of certain incidences described. Highly recommended.

"PS a memoir" by Pierre Salinger was a disappointment for this reader. My only motivation to read this book was the fact that he was press secretary in the Kennedy and, for a few months, in the Johnson administration. Here was a man, a journalist by trade, whom I presumed would be able to provide candid insights from behind the curtain of myth and disinformation.I can understand reticence immediately after the fact but this book was published in 1995, thirty years have passed since his tenure in the White House, most of the dramatis personae have passed on - for histories sake sir, tell us what really happened, or at least what you heard or saw. Alas, Mr. Salinger is a keeper of secrets and a perpetuator of myths without equal. You will not read a disparaging word or even a hint of scandal concerning the Kennedy's. No bits about the scandal plagued West Virginia primary, or of Old Joe Kennedy meddling in his son's Presidency, Kennedy's health issues or of sexual trysts and Sinatra's rat-pack parties. I just wish the author gave a more balanced and truthful first hand report instead of the usual public relations jazz. No, I do not expect to hear about all the dirty laundry but in this account it never existed at all!I will admit the Mr. Salinger has had a full and eventful life. His breezy writing style and self-depreciating humor are welcomed. Ultimately though this book is next to useless to the inquisitive student of history and I seriously doubt it will listed in the bibliographies of Presidential historians.Mr. Salinger mentions his other Kennedy related books in the text. I think they call that product placement in the movies. I am not inclinded to read them because of my objections mentioned above. Nonetheless if you are interested just search Amazon and I sure to can buy them for a few cents..plus S&H; of course!

This review is for the classical music CD set of the complete opera Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner. This set consist of 3 CD's and was released in 2006 by Naxos. Leif Segerstam conducts the Royal Swedish Opera and Orchestra.Naxos, in my estimation, is the gold standard in CD package design and disk documentation. The front insert cover art reproduction, type fonts and type colors all contribute to ease of product identification. The back insert provides summarized disk information: tracks, total time and acts. A 12-page booklet included with this set is extremely useful. In addition to a detailed track listing it contains a synopsis of the opera. The events of each act and scene are described and keyed to the appropriate CD and track. As a first time listener to the entire opera I found this very useful. The sung text is not provided but on page 1 of the booklet Naxos provided a link where a PDF file can be downloaded.The three CD's come packaged in a large jewel box with individual cradles for each disk. This packaging is somewhat bulky but stand up nicely on a shelf and will take a lot of punishment without any damage to the disk. In addition the sturdy box makes a nice shipping container- if you ever were to part with these disks!I am not a musician or musical scholar. I do enjoy listening to classical music and I have developed an interest in opera. From my first introduction to classical music I have been a fan of Wagner - even if at first I didn't know whom the composer was, I was mesmerized by the overpowering themes contained in his music.The quality of the recordings; the bargain price and the Naxos packaging make this set well worth acquiring by the classical music enthusiast.

Ring Around the Sun by Clifford D. SimakBOSTON, MASS, (AP)-There may be another earth just a second ahead of us and another world a second behind us and another world a second behind that one...well you get the idea. A sort of continuous chain of worlds, one behind the other. That is the theory of Dr. Vincent Aldridge....from "Ring Around the Sun" Chapter 2,page 10Published in 1953, "Ring Around the Sun" was Clifford D. Simak's 4th novel.The protagonist of this novel is one Jay Vickers, a dedicated writer of fiction who, as it is revealed later in the story, was raised in a small town the Mid-West near the Wisconsin River -just like the author! Vickers, as he is referred too throughout the book, has only one goal, to complete his manuscript. His agent, the indomitable Ann Carter, want Vickers to write about the unbelievable but true "Forever" cars, houses, razors and carbohydrates that are being practicably being given throught "gadget stores". Without revealing too much of the plot I'll just add the Vickers become wrapped around the "forever" issue, well just about forever.This reader found the first 100 of this 200-page book absorbing reading - almost in the "could not put it down" territory. It did seemed to me that once the protagonist discovered the answer to the weird goings-on the rest of the book meandered to a discordant halt - like a top that slowly stopped spinning - I trust that is not a spoiler for anyone!In this early novel several of the narrative themes Simak used in many of his 26 novels are present: alternative Earths in abundance , arcane knowledge gleaned from the stars, robots with the manners of an English butler, and a less than nostalgic visit to his hometown. One of the secret pleasures of reading Simak's novels is to attempt connecting the dots and see what results - usually not too much but the challenge is the thing.This novel was first published as a 3 part serial in the American science fiction magazine GALAXY during 1952-3. The last printing of the title in the U.S. was an Avon paperback in 1969, which ran several printing. Fortunately for interested readers copies of the book are available on Amazon and E-Bay at reasonable prices.

S. T. Joshi, a noted Lovecraft scholar, is to be commended for this annotated collection of four stories. In addition to being a decidedly acquired taste, reading Lovecraft can be a monumental chore. Lovecraft has many times confounded this reader with his cryptic language, obscure references to early 20th Century scientific speculations and inside references to fellow authors. Editor Joshi tracks down all these lemmings and confirms that they are in fact cryptic and obscure BUT interesting. One would speculate that Lovecraft had little interest in "popular" success but wrote for his own pleasure and the favor of his correspondents and friends.The four stories in this collection are: "The Rats In the Walls", "The Colour Out of Space", "The Dunwich Horror", and "At The Mountains of Madness". The editor does not discuss his selections of stories. In my opinion "At The Mountains of Madness" which runs for 152 pages is so repetitious in it's descriptions and exclamations Lovecraft could of reduce it by 100 pages and it would have been a much more effective story. I found it an endurance test to read. I would have preferred my favorite Lovecraft story "Shadow Over Innsmouth" in its place.S.T. Joshi included some nice "extras" in this volume: 22 photographs, a bibliography, short essays about HPL by other authors, HPL on Weird Fiction and HPL in the Media.Anyone interested in Lovecraft's fiction would by advised to read this excellent book. I would also recommend the Necronomicon Press annotated edition of The Shadow over Innsmouth.Why read Lovecraft? Well this quote sums it up for this reader:"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation of flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age. -HPL "The Call of Cthulhu" 1926

"Cemetery World", published in 1973 by Clifford D. Simak [1904-88] envisions a far future where a devastating war will render large portion of Earth uninhabitable. During the lead up to this war the "intellectual elite" exited Earth and have established flourishing outpost on earth-like planets. Century's later great numbers of colonist return their loved ones to the home planet for interment giving rise to a self-serving corporation that manages the vast expanse of the Cemetery. Small-inbred communities of human inhabit the few wild lands remaining depending on odd jobs with the Cemetery for necessities. Fletcher Carlson, an artist, returns to Earth to create a multi-media composition with the help of two robots. The Cemetery Corporation is unhelpful suspecting that Carlson has other motives. Carlson eventually determines that the corporation has some dark secrets it does not want discovered at any cost. Complicating matters a young lady, Cynthia Lansing, joins Carlson and is convinced a mysterious alien race has secreted archaeological treasures somewhere on earth. As a science-fiction novel this is a well-crafted story with ample suspense and fleshed out characters.The underlying premise and motivations of this story, as outlined above, are both engaging and creditable in the context of a science-fiction novel. I was taken back when the ghost, or shades as they preferred to be called, started showing up and then proceeded to send the human characters back and forth through time. In the context of this story these fantasy themes appeared to be completely out of place. But as the old sailor said on many occasions "It is what it is like it or not"."Cemetery World" by Clifford D. Simak is a perplexing book to categorize. It is marketed as a "science fiction novel" but contains aspects of pure fantasy that some readers may find disconcerting. Actually more than disconcerting, ardent SF fans are a contentions and vocal lot and ruminated about this in the fan press and with the author. Of course this is all so much balderdash from 40 years ago but the issue still remains as, hopefully, you will find out upon reading. In a 1978 interview Simak addresses the issue: "I suppose ghost and robots do not mix, but I see no reason why they shouldn't. If a writer wants to interweave the old mythology with the new, there should be nothing to prevent it."Even so there is a lot to admire and enjoy in this novel. In case your interested Simak's mixing of science-fiction and fantasy elements shows up in several other of his novels: "Enchanted Pilgrimage"[1975] and "Out of Their Minds"[1970]. So either hunt these titles up on the internet or mark them DO NOT READ!This book was first published in Analog magazine as a three part serial in 1973.

I found Master of Everon (1979) by Gordon R. Dickson to be an exceptionally interesting novel. The author has taken a standard science-fiction plot theme - colonist from Earth settle on a alien planet and "terraform" it's ecology to be habitable - and pumps enough life and interesting ideas and plot twist to keep you up at night turning pages. I should not be surprised because Dickson is a master writer in the SF field.The plot outline is as follows: Humanity from earth is migrating to habitable planets. Prior to allowing colonist to homestead the Ecology Corps evaluates the planet for dangerous flora and fauna and them decided which earth based plants and animals can be introduced without destroying the local ecology.Jef Robini travels to the planet Everon with a native animal, a malot, he has raised from a pup. His brother Wil - an Ecology Corps employee, gave the malot -described as a large tiger-like beast - to Jef 8 years ago. Jef is a trained anthropologist and is studying the effects of introducing the malot to its native habitat. Jef is also looking for answers to his brother's death - he suspects foul play.The plot is reasonably interesting but the charm of this book is the author's ability to convince the reader that we are on an alien planet and that nothing can be taken for granted and mysteries abound- even with the most commonplace things. For example Jef runs out of rations he carried from Earth and is offered a meal of bacon, eggs, toast and coffee from a group of settlers. He notices every eye is upon him as he takes the first bite. The food looks fine but it was raised on Everon - grown in its soil, warmed by its sun. Jef remarks that yes it's good but different - the most common has been transformed its strange, different.Gordon R. Dickson (1923-2001) was one of the most prolific science fiction authors of the 20th century. During his lifetime his contemporaries generally overshadowed him. Now several years after his passing you cannot find any of his titles in brick and mortar bookstores or for that matter in your local library. If you are interested in well-crafted stories with a seasoning of thoughtful science fiction ideas and concepts I recommend you search out titles by Mr. Dickson.

Going DowntownThe title of this memoir "Going Downtown" by a veteran fighter pilot of the Korean and Viet Nam War refers to the pilot's terms for combat missions over the capital of North Vietnam, Hanoi.Author Jack Broughton provides us ground huggers a vicarious feeling of what it is like to put on a flight suit, climbed into a cockpit and blast off straddling tons of jet fuel and racks full of ordinances. Once airborn the "fun" is just beginning. Thunderstorms, fog, cranky electro-mechanical gremlins and those pesky anti-aircraft weapons keep the adrenalin pumping. It is amazing that the author survived so many combat missions in Korea and Viet Nam - he must have had good karma.The author makes his point repeatedly that the political consideration that resulted in restriction on the use of US Air Power in Viet Nam was detrimental to the war effort and materially contributed to the lost of planes and pilots. This issue has been debated since the end of the Viet Nam war and from my readings I believe the author is correct. Aircraft and pilots (and the whole US military presents in SVN for that matter) were "used" to somehow coerce the NVN to call off their efforts in the South and negotiate. Politicians like McNamara, Johnson, Rusk, Bundy and other were dead wrong in assuming that Ho would cave in to their gradual escalation and restrictive rules of engagement. The names on the Viet Nam memorial are mute testament to their arrogance and hubris.I have one minor complaint concerning this book. The author and the editor must have assumes that readers would be very familiar with flying terminology - which is used quite liberally in the text. Well, I am not, and a glossary of aeronautical terms would of been very helpful - not completely necessary, but nonetheless helpful.

L. Sprague DeCamp (1907-2000), noted science fiction and science author had published in 1993 a collection of his related "time-travel" stories under the title "Rivers of Time". The book consists of nine stories and an afterword by the author. Seven of the ten stories had been previously published between the years 1956-93. The BAEN paperback is the only edition ever published of this title to date - 2011.Each story concerns the adventures of Reginald Rivers co-proprietor of a business that takes clients way-way back in time on safaris to hunt big game - to be more specific dinosaurs and their kin and cousins. He relates to us interested readers amusing, and yes interesting tales of the nincompoops and dolts he has had to put up with in order to maintain his cash flow.Reginald speaks with a heavy dosage of Australian slang and a keen knowledge of the eras and the correct biological names for the inhabitants. While this is certainly impressive of the author's knowledge of science and "down-under" slang I found it at times, well, overwhelming and distracting. Nonetheless a good, quick read.

Voodoo Planet by Andre NortonVoodoo Planet (1959) is the 3rd book in the series detailing the adventures of the crew from the Free Traders Starship Solar Queen. The other books by Andre Norton and the first publication date are as follows: Sargasso of Space (1955), Plague Ship (1956), and Postmarked the Stars (1969).It certainly would be desirable to read these books in sequence but it is not essential. Each story stands alone but references are made to events that took place in the previous volumes. Unfortunately the books are long out of print but are readily available on used book sites like Amazon at reasonable cost.The story open with the Solar Queen being retrofitted as a mail transport on the planet Xecho. The Chief Ranger from Xecho's sister planet Khatka convinces Captain Jellico that an expense paid excursion to the exclusive game preserves on his planet would be beneficial for both the three invited members of the Solar Queen's crew and for the Ranger. Chief Ranger Asaki confesses that his society has a problem with an outbreak of voodoo and need the assistance of the ships medic Tau who has made a study of magic on many worlds.Norton deftly weaves into the opening chapter the startling history of Khatka. During the Second Atomic War on Earth all native Africans were herded into concentration camps for extermination. Some of the prisoners escaped and commandeered two Starships that eventually landed on the Eden-like planet Khatka. The new order is that the lighter your skin the lower you are on the social scale.Honestly I could not put this book down until the last page. This book is a tour de force of Norton's writing talents and is highly recommended to interested readers.

Author Farren proposes that the remnants of a post atomic war society are reduced to the point where the few remaining towns are semi-feudal enclaves struggling to holding off the barbarians. The book employed many themes familiar to readers of Western novels: gunfights, gamblers, horses, cowboys etc. Two elements held over from pre holocaust times add an interesting twist and make the novel somewhat interesting: the use of "crystal" probably heroin and the phonograph recordings of certain male rock vocalist being used as semi-religious text. The artists are referred to as prophets just in case we don't get the author's intent. This last item adds nice atmospheres to the novel but the author does not develop it fully - I feel that the concept is bogus since 99% of pop music is not subject to any other interpretation other than entertainment. Sounds silly but some cultural horses-asses claim to have received "messages "while they were "under to influence" listing to rock recordings.The story is a downer from page one. Hero's get wiped out, evil triumphs over "good" chaos over order. If it were a movie I wager the sound track at least would by great.If the topic of this title strokes your interest see author Farrens book Jim Morrison's Adventures in the Afterlife. (Honest title)The only US edition of this title - Avon paperback 27011 published 1975 - give a good overview of the book theme with this cover notation "Far in the Future a Decaying Freaked Out Civilization Battles for Survival Against Tribal Arcarny!"

Phil Farmer has cleverly used historical and fictional characters in many of his stories. This novel propels Ishmael of Moby Dick fame from the mast of the ship Rachel, sailing the South Seas in 1842, into the far, far future of Earth. Farmer attributes this "time travel" experience as a consequence of looking at the cryptic carvings engraved upon Queequeg's coffin. Additional references to Moby Dick show up throughout the story. Ishmael is saved from drowning by a providential appearance of the harpooners coffin and on several occasions he ponders about Ahab and his obsession with The Whale.Ishmael find himself in a future with a swollen red Sun, oceans evaporated to the point where islands appear to be mountains and the primary means of travel are lighter than air ships that rely on sails and air bladders. Ishmael quickly established himself as a warrior leader and after disposing several kinds of vicious predators gets a kingdom and the girl.To be honest this is a minor Farmer work; light and pleasant reading. I would recommend this book for some interesting comments about the idol cults Ishmael must contend with to win over the confidence of the natives. Farmer almost always works some perceptive observations pertaining to religion into his books and this one is no exception. Readers looking for some deep analysis of Moby Dick will be disappointed.

In this excellent novel by Robert Silverberg the inhabitants of the planet Earth have brought upon themselves two cataclysmic events: the animosity of a vindictive alien race and global chaos through misuse of attempted weather modification.The aborted climate control project resulted in then eventual melting of the polar ice caps and led to mass starvation, loss of technological expertise and mendicant status in the universe.The animosity resulted from the supreme vanity of humans in maintaining "zoos" of aliens beings considered inferior because of low apparent cultural, industrial or scientific achievements. One of the more embittered alien races obtains substantial financial rights to Earth's resources in return for help rendered after the weather system ran amok.The proceeding is only the back story for a tale of a society set adrift in a ruined environment, technologically impoverished and haunted by the remains of genetic experimentations.Silverberg, a master story weaver adds each plot embellishment so an to not overwhelm the reader or detract from the human drama unfolding. In my opinion one of his best novels - highly recommended.

Catherine Lucille Moore (1911-87), who wrote under the name C.L. Moore, was a science fiction and fantasy writer with numerous magazine titles published during the period 1934-56. In 1940 she married Henry Kuttner (1915-58). Afterwards, almost all of their stories were written in collaboration under various pseudonyms."Jirel of Joiry", is a collection of related stories first published in Wierd Tales magazine 1934-39. Jirel is a sward-wielding warrior in a fantasy world redolent with evil magicians and barbarian warlords. Reader's farmiliar with the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard or those concerning Elric of Melnibon&eacute; by Michael Moorcock know what to expect.It is notable considering the time these stories were written that Jirel is female. Aside from that noteworthy fact today these stories are, well, more of an historical curiosity for fans and students of heroic fantasy. I found these tales wordy, overlong, and frankly not very interesting or creative. To be completely fair in the 1930's I would imagine readers of Wierd Tales would have found them to be terrific. I will acknowledge the Ms Moore was a trailblazer in the field of heroic fantasy-fiction and she should be remembered and honored for that fact.

In this story Jack Vance has included all the components for another of his intriguing science-fiction novels - except for one. There is the carefully worked out interaction of off worlders and the natives, the interplay of geography upon culture against the fascinating backdrop of the Gaean Reach - what is missing is a exceptional plot to tie all these element together. The result is a somewhat pedestrian story that happens to be set on another planet.Two hundred years ago space explorers compelled cessation of huge tracks of tribal land from the nomadic natives. Today the lands are baronial estates and the natives, finally aware they have been swindled, are plotting to have their lands returned.The story focuses on one of the founding families and their struggle to fight off rampaging natives and their meddling off world supporters. Various stereotypical characters abound: the strong willed daughter, the handicapped son, and the faithful native servant - you get the picture.Nonetheless this is vintage Vance and I give it four stars. Not a classic but still a good read.

The story of three sheltered children who decide to leave the confines of their gated home and explore Zimbabwe 200 years in the future is a tale that will appeal to both adults and children alike. The pleasure of reading this engrossing story was compounded by the imaginative characters the author introduces to propel the narrative.Author Nancy Farmer resided in Africa for 17 years and has used her extensive knowledge of culture and folkways to infuse this novel with a tone of authenticity.The title of this appealing story refers to the three genetically altered individuals who use their mutated talents of hearing, seeing and limb elasticity to solve crimes. The fact that these somewhat clumsy detectives are usually always "a dollar short and a minuet late" add to the charm of this engaging science fiction/fantasy tale.

The Mercenary by Jerry PournelleTo be precise the book titled "The Mercenary" is a collection of related stories "fixed-up" as a novel. The stories were all published in the American science-fiction magazine, "Analog". Following are the individual story titles and magazine date of publication: "Peace with Honor" May, 1971, "The Mercenary" July, 1972 and "Sword and Sceptre" published as a two part story May and June 1973. First paperback edition was published by Pocket Books in January 1977.In summation this book is a militarized Space Opera: glamorous US marines of the space ways (referred to as the CoDominium) battle hired mercenaries on foreign planets.I will concede that author Pournelle's efforts at verisimilitude are laudable, but overall they ring hollow, reality is sacrificed to the yarn. This is not to concede that the story is tedious or uninteresting but what might have been a sweeping epic is just a good read - and quite honestly there is nothing wrong with that!Pournelle presents a future where political dissidents and felons are involuntary shipped out to become colonist on habitable planets. This is similar how Britain populated Australia. On Earth the electorate is being manipulated by unscrupulous politicians - not much new here folks. The story line concerns an ex-CoDominium marine discharged for "political" reasons who recruits a mercenary army that is hired out by the colony worlds to fight the inevitable wars.

11 hours 9CD's Edward Herrmann Simon and Schuster AudioThe following comments are for the unabridged CD audio book version of " The Great Bridge - The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge" by David McCullough. The reader is Edward Herrmann. Simon and Schuster Audio markets this item.Over the past several years I has listened to many audio books. They have been my faithful companions on many extended business trips and along innumerable miles walking the treadmill. In my oppinion Edward Herrmann is, by far, the best narrator for these products. His easy conversational voice is, to me, like a good friend sharing with you a wonderful story just for your personal enjoyment. I never had the notion he is reading from a script - although, of course, he is. He also refrains for the most part from trying to mimic voices of characters in the story - for me that rarely works. He does change his tone to convey emotion just as we would in a conversation.This unabridged audio book consist 9 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 11 hours. The disks are secured in two standard cardboard multi CD holders. These inserts slide into the external packaging box. The CD holders do not have identifications on the spine listing the CD numbers. I mention this minor point because a numbering feature is very useful when you're looking for the next CD. To make life easier for myself I add an identifying sticky note on the CD holders.John Augustus Roebling (1806-1869) and his son Washington Roebling (1837-1926) designed and engineered the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge 1870-83, which in itself is a fascinating chronicle. That part of this audio book is covered in approximately 5 hours of the 11-hour total playtime. Intertwined with the actual construction details is a plethora of information concerning: history of construction techniques of other bridges, the composition of the Brooklyn Bridge board of directors with biographical information, analysis of various lawsuits brought against the Bridge corporation or Roebling, New York City political corruption as exemplified by William F. "Boss" Tweed of Tammany Hall and several other topics. I found these issues very informative and felt they enhances the overall story of the bridge. Other listeners may feel these topics contain "too much information" and could have been edited.

Magic in Ithkar - A word to long time Fantasy readers [and fans of Andre Norton] we are treading on very familiar ground here - ancient visitors, priest and temples, legends of an ancient war, good magic, bad magic, intelligent animals etc, etc. If done adequately, spiffed up and handled with TLC these Fantasy elements can assist the authors to hang a good story on - and entertain the reader. I found the story quality quite good - that is entertaining. My real grip with this book is that several of the stories made references to people and places that the authors must of assumed the reader had prior knowledge of. Perhaps the background information concerning Ithkar provided to the authors was considerably more detailed than that printed in the introduction. My search found four Ithkar books all edited by Adams and Alice Mary Norton aka Andre Norton. Since the concept of Ithkar and the yearly fair could generate four books of stories perhaps one of the authors was motivated to write a related novel.

The Dark Design - Riverworld Book 3 by Philip Jose FarmerBook 3 in the Riverworld series, The Dark Design, is a complete departure from the previous two volumes: The Fabulous Riverboat - Book 2 and To Your Scattered Bodies Go - Book 1. The first two books were very good action-adventure science fiction novels. This book utilized the same background and some of the characters from the previous volumes but is primarily a series of philosophical essays and thinly disguised biographical sketches from the author's life experiences. Interspaced are bits and pieces of the Riverworld story line with several chapters at the end propelling the narrative to a cliff hanging ending.Some readers will be frustrated by what appears to be Farmer's long ramblings before the story line is picked up again, and then dropped. The author anticipated this with his forward where he tells us that he wrote what would amount to over 800 pages to conclude this part of his Riverworld story. Having read this book I could red pencil out about 100 pages and it would read better and the story would be a lot more interesting - for general readers. I suspect the author and the published decided to print the whole darn thing because of Farmer's stature as one the better writers in the field.I am a fan of Farmer and have read most of his SF novels. I know some of his biography and I enjoyed every pages of this book. I do believe that casual readers may be disappointed by, what would appear to be, meandering excursions from the main story line.Of great interest to me is that author Farmer includes himself as one of the main characters. I am not making this up - in the forward Farmer states "it is true that I am the basis for that character": Peter Jairus Frigate.I rated this novel 5 stars, but I can understand why others would rate it with less stars.

The following comments are for "The Choice" by Bob Woodward - audiocassette version.In retrospect the contest for the presidential election of 1996, Clinton vs. Dole, is for many an historical curiosity of marginal significance. Bob Dole got trounced and then faded into the sunset.My interest in this book has more to do with the man, Bob Dole, then the electoral outcome or the issues. Since I read his autobiography "One Soldier's Story: A Memoir" I came to the realization that Mr. Dole was not only a courageous survivor of crippling war injuries but an individual I personally admired a great deal.This book, presents the political Dole in an evenhanded manner that confirmed my high oppinion of him. Certainly Clinton is covered in great detail since it is, of course, a book about both candidates.Students of the 1996 election will find this book a helpful research tool.

The Visitor - Clifford D. Simak (1904-88)The novel "The Visitor" (1980) was first published as a three part serial in Analog magazine in 1979. It's subject matter, Earth being visited by aliens from outer space, is a topic that has been run to ground by many authors. It's somewhat surprising that an experienced writer like Simak, late in his career, would resurrected this idea into a novel length work. Well, he did and the results are mixed.A very large rectangular slap lands in the fictional town of Lone Pine, Minnesota. After ingesting some critters and a young man - soon to be expelled - the Visitor begins to consume trees, more and more of them. Eventually out pops bales of cellulous material and then miniature versions of the Visitor, which consume the bales. Needless to say this raised serious concerns in Washington.The book consists of 57 chapters of 2 to 5 pages in length. The action, such as it is, rotates between the following locations per the chapter titles: "Washington D.C." - as the crisis depends the President and his advisors mull over what to do and more importantly what not to do; "Lone Pine, Minnesota" - the town drunk keeps tabs on the Visitor for a bottle or a fiver and the town folks wish they would all go away; "Minneapolis" - the hard boiled editor of a major metropolitan daily obtains scoops and scoops from his fearless news-gal and photographer.Honestly there is not much that happens in this story once the Visitors lands and is discovered. The President mulls, locals observe and the news hounds sneak around and report. The author inserts some sentimental silliness near the end of the book when the Visitors start expelling cellulous autos and houses - yes it's in the book! Eventually the book doesn't end it, well, just stops - as if the author ran out of ideas or realized he has run this old chestnut to ground.Fans and admires of Clifford Simak should by all means read this book. You will enjoy the chapters titles "Minneapolis" since they all take place in a newspaper office, where Simak had labored all his professional life. Inquiring readers may be better served with some of his other titles that I greatly admire and unhesitatingly recommend: "Time and Again" (1951) - "Choice of Gods" (1971) and "Highway to Eternity" - his last book which was published in 1986.

For the vast majority of Americans, myself included, the D-Day invasion has faded into the shadows of history. We perceive it, if at all, as one of those many touchstones, or cultural icons, in the WWII story that helps us gain a viewpoint of what happened and what is about to take place. With retrospection we know D-Day was a resounding success. We are like a person who reads the last page of a novel, knows that the protagonist achieves success and then discounts all the trepidations throughout the text. This book is highly recommended because through the audio comments of participants on the two included CD's we are confronted with real trepidation and fear and anxiety. Success was not a predetermined conclusion.A note to those buying a used edition, make sure both CD's are included. Those disks tend to get misplaced and without them the book looses significance.

A Jew, a Moslem a Baptist and a lapsed Catholic are sent to Mars to investigate artifacts found by unmanned rovers. They are taken captive by beings from another star; the Krsh. 2000 years ago these same beings had captured a number of Jewish men and women from earth for study and observation. Another space faring race, The Sons of Darkness, attacked the Krsh, were defeated but caused the Krsh star ship to crash landing on Mars. The Krsh and the captives set up an integrated society in underground caverns. One of the captives is Jesus and everyone, including the Krsh believes he is God's anointed.Discussing any more of this story would spoil the pleasure of discovery for potential readers. I will only say that Farmer is very respectful of religious beliefs and exhibits a keen knowledge of the bible, ancient sects and Judaism. The real accomplishment is that he provides us a very interesting story with believable characters and does not get trapped in endless debates about religion.On the short bookshelf labeled Science Fiction Novels About Religion this interesting story will be found, well worn from repeated readings by the curious and by admires of Philip Farmer. If you have read any of the author's other books you already know that religion, the afterlife, speculation about individual faith and the Deity are common themes in his works. Sometimes these topics are in the foreground sometimes in the background but always a hovering presence.The premise for this story is, well, somewhat contrived and hard to swallow. The author makes a valiant attempt to rationalize it and in the end, I believe, succeeds.

A. (Abraham) Merritt (1884-1943) is known to experienced readers of fantasy and science fiction for his eight novels of which the "Metal Monster" was his second.First published as a serial in a pulp fiction magazine in 1920 author Merritt refused to have it published in book form until 1941. In the introduction to my Hippocampus Press edition the reader is informed that "Merritt was dissatisfied with it's writing and revised and reshaped the story and cut 10,000 words from the text". Undaunted I have read the "restored edition" and I can well appreciate the author's dilemma. After all I was warned, even the author was dissatisfied with the story.Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, fresh from his adventures in the South Pacific- see Merritt's "The Moon Pool", travels to the Trans-Himalayan region where he discovers "awesome beings of living metal". The author spends over 200 pages attempting to describe these metal beings that suck energy from the sun. The prose is just mind numbing, for example:"Out from the star shapes was hurled the bolts of emerald and of purple! Out from the crosses whirled and linked saffron and scarlet flame! Forth from the disks flew the blasting globes! The crater was threaded with their lightings- the lightings of the Metal Peoples was broidered with them, was a pit woven with vast and changing patters of electric flames!"The plot can be summarized in one sentence: Dr. Goodwin and his companions are captured by the Metal People, observe and comments upon inexplicable events and escape to tell their story to the world.One very curious aspect of this story takes place at the very beginning. A. Merritt imports himself into the story as a minor character. He is introduced to Dr. Goodwin as a writer who will chronicle the events of the mysterious journey to the Trans-Himalayan region.I cannot recommend this book to any but diehard Merritt fans. I found the story uninteresting, difficult to understand and over stuffed with esoteric phrases and description. New readers should instead seek out Merritt's "Dwellers in the Mirage", "The Moon Pool", "Ship of Ishtar" or "Face In the Abyss".

Inferno Nivens and PournelleAuthors Larry Nivens and Jerry Pournelle brainstormed a terrific idea for a science-fiction novel: a rewrite of Dante's Inferno set in the 20th century with the protagonist a science-fiction writer. I purchased the paperback when it was first issued in 1976. With a plot like that I could not pass up reading this novel.The author's are to be commended for successfully merging a certain amount of spooky supernaturalism with a busman tour of the neither region. I was somewhat thrown off balance when one of hell's subordinate devils is played for comic relief. Rather then provide an opportunity for sly wit and crafty dialog I found this character weaken the previously created infernal atmosphere.The reader is presented with a choice of two rationales for the existence of hell: either it is the creation of a sadistic being from another world for perverted amusements populated by robotic demons or it is in reality, Hell where presumably bad folks are sent for punishment. The protagonist mulls this conundrum while he journeys from one region to another. Crafty readers will detect that the author's want us to decide just what the hell - hell is, or is not.I wonder how Phil Farmer or Phil Dick or Phillip McCann would of handled this story idea.

This book is not, strictly speaking, a biography of Stalin nor is it a history of the Soviet Union during the life of Stalin. I read this book as a detailed chronicle of depravity and butchery orchestrated by Stalin and experienced by the Soviet people. Stalin, turned loose by the Communist Revolution, was a fiend who devoured everyone he came in contact with: comrades of the Revolution, leading generals during wartime and members of his own family.I found this book to be objective and well researched. The extensive use of quotations and footnotes contributed to the obvious conclusion: Stalin was truly evil personified.This book will, like a bucket of ice water dumped on your head, sober up uninformed individuals who harbor any abstract compassion for Communism or our "brother in arms" Uncle Joe Stalin.Highly recommended but depressing reading in the sense that this is not a work of fiction but a chronicle of millions of people murdered by the rule of one evil man.

All But The People - FDR and his Critics 1933-39 - published in 1969Four thousand years ago Moses said to his people: "Pick up your shovels, mount your asses, load your camels and ride into the Promised Land." Four thousand years later Mr. Roosevelt said to HIS people: "Throught down your shoves, sit on your asses, light up a Camel: This is the Promised Land." from an anti-New Deal business card.I found this book to be exceptionally noteworthy, and in some respects fascinating. For those of us who did not come of age during 1933-39 I opine that we have been conditioned by our culture, and in some cased by our education to look back at "Roosevelt's "New Deal" as a resounding success passionately support by the citizenry. The authors clearly and succinctly makes a compelling case that both Roosevelt and the "New Deal" were subjected to withering criticism and opposition from a full spectrum of individuals, organizations, political groups, leading newspaper publishers and, most surprisingly of all, many members of his own Democratic party - particularly those from the South. This is not to say that the New Deal had few supporters, it certainly did, but I was quite surprised at the width and depth of the opposition.This book is almost encyclopedic in scope. It contains hundreds of quotes, 27 pages of notes and a useful index. It is not, I would suggest, a book to read right through. After 20 pages or so I had to put it aside for a day. Although I did read the entire book it is more useful as a reference.The authors try to walk the find line between neutral objectivity and tilting towards Roosevelt point of view. They do make a clear case that objections to the "New Deal" programs were a legitimate and expected facet of our democracy. They also point out many cases where the negativity was extreme. It was one thing to say the "New Deal" was destroying capitalism and another to say Roosevelt was in bed with Joe Stalin, was a communist or a "damn Jew" who wanted to be dictator.If the subject matter interest you - you may like to add this book to your library.

"A Time of Changes" by Robert SilverbergThe planet Borthan was settled thousands of years ago by religious exiles from Earth. One of the inhabitants, Kinnall, has a rebellious outlook towards his religion which teaches that the self is to be despised, and it forbids anyone from revealing his innermost thoughts or feelings to another. The catalyst for his sedition is a trader from Earth who introduces Kinnall to a drug that joins it's users into full awareness...and then the problems and conflicts commence. This is a thoughtful and entertaining story and is highly recommended.The story was first published as a serial in Galaxy magazine March - June 1971. Its first book printing was a hardbound edition issued by the Science Fiction Book Club in 1971. There have been numerous paperback editions over the years the last being in 2009. It won the Nebula award for best novel in 1972.

The Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5 is one of those 20th Century wars that have faded into obscurity for many people.Prior to reading this book my knowledge of the conflict was limited to the fact that the peace treaty was signed in Kittery Maine at the Portsmouth Navy Base near where I reside. This little known detail has proved to be a useful trivia question I have used to astonish friends and family.The details of this conflict are of interest only to focused scholars and students, which is a pity. The outcome of this largely forgotten war has had a profound effect of the history of the 20th century and affected millions of lives. This is clearly summarized in the author's introduction. Japan's victory over a major power encouraged territorial expansion that was not halted until 1945. Russia imploded with the defeat sweeping out the Tsar and ushering in the Revolution.This book is not a history of the conflict, it's origins or it's resolution. The author, a Russian living in the U.S., only details the doomed voyage of the Russian fleet sent to intimidate the Japanese and reinforce the Russian forces at Port Arthur and Valadivosrok. The Russian Admiral commanding this fleet, Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was fully aware that his aging ships, untrained crew, unreliable allies and a corrupt admiralty full of political appointees could only result in a calamity.The fleet left Russia on October 2, 1904 and after sailing 18,000 miles was nearly completely destroyed in a few short hours on May 14, 1905.Despite the appalling conclusion of this voyage the author presents a compelling story full of fascinating details and insights. Highlights were discussions of the power political being played whenever the Russian fleet entered a port for re-coaling. I also found the several quotes from Admiral Rozhestvensky to his wife expressing his frustration and sense of impending disaster compelling reading

For those familiar with the science fiction writings of Philip Jose Farmer (1918-2009) this book will come as quite a revelation. It is a contemporary mainstream novel and as such contains none of the science fiction plot elements most readers would expect from a Farmer story. The story concerns race relations in a steel mill during WW2. Danny, a white man who aspires to be a doctor some day, works a manual labor job at the Mill. He had been discharged from the Navy after an accident. His co-workers at the mill are black men and women. Danny makes an effort to not let the prevailing prejudices affect his interaction with them. His complex relationship with an attractive co-worker, a black woman, is the core of this story.First published in 1962 as a Monarch paperback this novel was never reprinted until 2009 in the Subterranean Press Anthology titled The Other in the Mirror. The reason why this immensely popular author's mainstream novel was "buried", is a story a biographer will be sure to unearth someday.I found the story face paced and very perceptive as to the way racial relationships are affect by even the most innocent remark or social interaction. Recommended even if you expected a science fiction novel.

Admiral Stansfield Turner, Director of the CIA 1977-81, has written a very valuable book that cannot be labeled a history but more of a survey of the Agency he once led. To further refine his focus Admiral Turner looks at the relationship between the CIA directors and the Presidents starting with Roosevelt and "Wild Bill" Donovan and concluding with George W. Bush and George Tenet. Unquestionably upon that relationship pivots the trust and the corresponding utility of the intelligence provided.The real value of this book is to enlighten the readers of those key intelligence topics faced by each administration. Have said that I was disappointed with the very thin bibliography. I would of like to have seen included a listing of those key books that address intelligence topics such as the U-2 over flights and the Pearl Harbor attack just for example.Students and general readers looking for a readable, short overview of intelligence issues and Key CIA players will find this a helpful book.

These comments are for the abridged audio book version of "Pearl Harbor - The Verdict of History" copyright 1990 by HighBridge Productions. The audio book consists of 2 cassette tapes and total run time is 3 hours and 5 minutes. Tony Roberts reads and does a commendable job.I found the subject matter attention grabbing and the systematic method of analyzing the evidence compelling. Therefore I was extremely disappointed the audio book was abridged. Certainly I could purchase the text and perhaps that is the reason for abridgements - like previews of a movie. Nonetheless these tapes are worth purchasing for the history aficionado, student or just the curious.Concerning the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor December 7, 1941: How did it happen? - How could it happen? - Who was responsible to prevent it happening? - Was it "allowed" to happen? - Questions such as these have been asked almost since the day the event took place. There have been Congressional hearing, investigations, books and documentaries all seeking answers or at least credible explanations. This book from an acknowledged "expert" on the subject certainly adds a convincing voice to the discussion. I keep contrasting the "event" at Pearl Harbor with those that took place on September 11, 2001. It can reasonable be postulated that history will repeat itself if we ignore the lessons of the past. One aspect of this book that I liked quite a lot was the inclusion of numerous quotes from period newspapers concerning Japan, the attack and the aftermath. If for no other reason this book will stimulate and perhaps even infuriate some listeners, which in my view makes the book worthwhile.

The following comments are for the abridged CD audio book version of "Ship of Ghost - The story of the USS Houston, FDR's legendary lost cruiser, and the epic saga of her survivors" by John D. Hornfischer. Robertson Dean reads the book.This audio book consist 5 compact disks with a total playtime of approximately 6 hours. Random House Audio is the publisher of this item.The disks are secured in the standard fan fold multi CD holder. A plastic insert secures the holder into the external packaging box.On 28 February 1942 the cruiser USS Houston was sunk as a result of a navel engagement with the Japanese off of Java, an island of Indonesia. Out of the original crew of 1,168 only 368 crew members made it to shore and were captured by the Japanese, 291 would survive to the end of the war.The first two disk, CD 1 & 2, provide the listener with a realistic and factual description of ship to ship navel warfare. The far out gunned allies fought courageously but their valor was no match against the numerically superior Japanses forces.The remaining disks detail life in capativity as a Japanese POW. It must be noted that the Houston survivors remained in captivity for the entire war. Most of the survivors were put to work constructing the Burma Railway, also known as the Death Railway.I have just completed my second listening to this CD audio book. This is a sad but true story that need to be heard. War and man's inhumanity must not be ignored less we end up learning that painful lesson again.I would like to note a couple of fact from that book that have been resonating in my mind.The survivors stopped briefly as the Mitsubishi Shipyard were slave labor and POW's were employed to manufacture warships. I recently check WIKI and the article on Mitsubishi omits the use of forced labor...interesting.After WW2 Congress voted a compensation of $2.50 per day of captivity for those that lived - that's correct two dollars and fifty cents. It was suggested the Japan should also compensated the survivors but this was deemed not to be politically correct and nothing ever came of it.Those survivors that made it back to the United States formed an association and held yearly reunion meetings. That fact that many were able to resume "normal' lives is a tribute to man's capacity to survive any adversity.The USS Houston was associated with president Roosevelt because he traveled - and fished - on the ship several times prior to the out break of war.For several years after the Houston sank it was believed there were no survivors. Name of captives were not exchanged during that war.One ironic fact was that one of the captives from the Houston was a Japanese-American who assumed his captives would take him for a Mexican of a Korean. One day his luck ran out and the Japanese discover a Son of Nippon amount the captives. After a beating he was displayed to the officer corps -they were amazed that a full blood Japanese would joint the "enemy".

"He lay flat on his back, looking at the glittering points in the sky. he was content to watch. Up there, he saw the final phase of the human race. As segments of pure thought, humanity could survive the extinction of both time and space at the end of the universe. The intelligence of man would remain untouched in the emptiness and would persist forever. But persist for what? He tried to conjure up what might come, if anything could, after time and space were gone. He could think of nothing." from Highway to EternityThe subject matters that are ruminated upon in "Highway To Eternity" by Clifford Simak, his last book incidentally, will not be unsettling to readers familiar with his other novels. New readers will, I suppose, be at first somewhat mystified then perhaps startled and finally, hopefully, inspired to seek out his other books.Clifford Simak published 26 novels over the period 1950 - 1986. "Highway To Eternity" is his last novel published in 1986. The author died two years later at age 84.On the surface this appears to be a convoluted "time travel" escapade interspaced with extensive metaphysical ponderings. Add to that an assortment of gruesome extraterrestrial aliens, dimwitted robots some mystifying beings, well, what results is a fine story but more to the point a suitable coda to Simak's novel-length works.An extensive plot summary would not be very helpful so I will digress and outline some of the more relevant themes pertinent to not only this story but to many other Simak novels. These ruminations are based upon my readings as an admirer of the author.ROBOTS - Robots are biologically created and almost identical in appearance and function to human. They are equal to humans in intelligence and believe that their eventual destiny is to be completely equilivent to human beings. There is some conjecture that they will replace "real" humans as "the" evolutionary entities on Earth. There is one major distinction: they cannot reproduce and seem to be emotionally stunted. Their role is usually one of a very intelligent helper, co-worker or servant, which they seem to accept without any introspection. Robots play a major role in several novels and are minor characters in several others.TIME TRAVEL - Shifting through time is a common event in some novels. There is hardly any discussion as to the how, it just happens. In some cases the "mechanism" is stolen or provided by aliens or is an action performed voluntary or involuntary by an alien being from an advanced civilization. The event of time traveling is used primarily as a means to propel the plot and not a subject of deep introspection.CRIPTIC BEINGS - In many books a supernatural, almost, god-like being plays a role that is critical to the story. The reader must usually, ultimately, decipher just who this entity may be, although there is almost always speculation as to its origins and motives.MANKINDS FUTURE - Several books are deeply speculative concerning the evolutionary role of "intelligence beings" on earth particularly when there is interaction with alien beings.NATURE - The author assumed a reverential attitude towards nature, primarily as it occurs in the American mid-west. In "Highway To Eternity" two humans speculated that after millions of years man has come to an evolutionary dead end and that intelligent trees will become the earth's contribution to the destiny of the universe.I am lifelong reader of science-fiction/fantasy, an admirer of Simak's works having have read many of his 26 novels. However I claim no unique insights or privileged knowledge or association with Simak. My goal here is only to encourage individuals who are attracted to thoughtful and entertaining science fiction, and yes fantasy, to read the novels written by Clifford Simak.

The volume covers the 1775 military campaign that attempted to conquer Canada and make it the 14th American colony. The fact that a majority of the Canadians were French Catholics and that the Catholic religion was held in very low esteem by the American political establishment appeared to have been conveniently overlooked.There are several characteristics of these books that I found quite admirable and would recommend to an individual considering a purchase. The authors make extensive use of double page drawings, full-page maps and numerous period illustration and photographs. In addition timelines, an index and a very helpful section titled "The Battlefield Today" make this a very useful volume for the student or the armchair general hidden within many of us.I will add one caution, due to limited pages count, 96 for this volume, the text is compressed to detailing facts - dates, events, what happened, how many were killed, captured etc. Those generous author narrations that explore motives, personalities and detailed backgrounds are missing. In conclusion I found this book an excellent supplement to other books I have read on the American Revolution and Benedict Arnold and recommend it on that basis.

Anything You Can Do by Randall GarrettRandall Garrett (1927-87) was a prolific writer; the majority of his works were published in American science fiction magazines during the period 1950 to 1970. His novel "Anything You Can Do" was first published as a two part serial in the May and June 1962 issues of Analog magazine. It was substantially expanded and published in hardbound by Doubleday in 1963. There have been two US paperback editions: Lancer 1969 and Leisure Books as "Earth Invader" publication date unknown. Fortunately readers interested in this title can download it for free from Project Gutenberg and read it on an e-reader. Used paper copies are available for sale on Amazon.Readers of science fiction novels quickly become aware that most, but not all, stories tend to gravitate into broad categories such as: time travel, alternate histories, space adventures, or beings with extraordinary abilities. "Anything You Can Do" fit very neatly into those stories concerning an alien being loose in society. Usually the alien is masquerading as a human making detection nearly impossible but in this case author Garrett presents us with a three-foot alien with four eyes, a taste for human flesh that looks like a centipede . Further discussion of the plot would give away certain details that could spoil the pleasure of reading this book.Credit the very talented Mr. Garrett for writing a clever take on a well used theme. The story kept my interest and the pages turning to see how it all shook out.

Author Bohning paints a disturbing and ultimately depressing portrait of the Kennedy brothers, Bobby in particular, who used the full influence and power of the United States to eradicate the tyrant Castro.The time, money and talent spent on this fool's errand is staggering and disheartening. Apologists state, and correctly I believe, that Cuba was just another battlefield in the Cold War and we had to man the ramparts wherever we found them. Opposing Castro is really not the point; the issue is the obsession with which the Kennedy's pursued the matter.As the author clearly shows by extensive references and quotations it was a fixation way out of proportion to the threat. The paradoxical fact is that after all the sad and silly shenanigans directed at his removal Mr. Castro is still in power over forty years after the Kennedy brothers died.Kennedy haters need not read this book. The author's scholarly text and extensive quotes speaks crisply to the point without resorting to Kennedy bashing. For readers familiar with how Jack and Bobby misbehaved once in office this book's revelations will be no surprise. For reader's raised on the Camelot myth be prepared to have your believe challenged.The unanswered question is why did the Kennedy's focus so much personal time and energy attempting to remove Castro from office. Issues in Berlin, South East Asia and the Soviet Union were more critical to our security and deserving of the scrutiny lavished on Cuba.

"Wishing for the impossible in the future is a good exercise, I think, especially for children; wishing for it in the past is surely the emptiest and saddest of occupations." - Edgar PangbornEdgar Pangborn (1909-76) wrote six novels in his career and it would be safe to assume that "Davy" is the book most admired by his fans and critics alike.Davy is one of the select group of science-fiction novels that combines dynamic, identifiable characters, a well thought out "pocket universe" and a story that tells us about life without being pedantic. The central character, Davy, is writing the biography of his teen years. We are 400 years in the future in a post-atomic holocaust America. A strong religion, accepted throughout the region, has outlawed all scientific knowledge and books considered "old time". Dave falls in with rebels and is involved with an aborted coup. Throughout the book are interspaced connecting narratives with the novel "present" for story continuity. He is wise beyond years. Through his mature eyes we are given character and emotional profiles of a variety of inhabitants of his intriguing society. Hard to put down and you wish it would not end - sure signs of a classic.St. Martin's Press first published Davy in a hardbound edition in 1964. It has gone throught numerous paperback editions over the years. As a sign of it's enduring popularity it was reissued in hardbound in 2004 by Old Earth Books. It was nominated for a Hugo award in 1964.

For readers familiar author Moorecock's writings this novel will be greatly appreciated as a continuation of a story cycle that has been expanding for almost half a century. For readers new to Moorcock it could be a very confusing book since the author introduces characters and themes from many of his other "Eternal Champion" story cycles.I have 26 titles by this author on my shelves but it has been many years since I have read one of his books. The White Wolf's Son clearly assured this reader that Mr. Moorcock is still in top form and a pleasure to read.This story concerns a precocious young lady, Oonagh von Bek, who unwillingly finds herself to be the focus of a nefarious plot to upset the Cosmic Balance. It seems she is related to the Dreamthieft and villains von Minct and his evil sidekick Kolsterheim believe that her virgin blood in conjunction with other mystical icons are the key to achieving their goal.As Onnagh is perused across the "Multiverse" on the moonbeam roads she is befriended by an extraordinary Moorcock character, Lord Renyard, a dandified wolf wearing a monocle, caring a cane with a fondness for books.Aside from the attention grabbing plot the author's unique ability to describe "other worldliness", innocent female charm, and vile scoundrels made this book a page-turner for this reader. I also relished the "steam-punk" technology descriptions - what a hoot!Naturally we have references and guest appearances from many characters from previous books in the Moorcock "Eternal Champion" cycle. After many years it was a pleasure to be reacquainted.

The Fall of Berlin 1945 by Anthony BeevorBritish historian Anthony Beevor has written a compelling book describing the Russian military operation that resulted in the capture of Berlin. The Red Army offensive began in mid January 1945 and concluded on May 2nd when the city's defenders finally surrender. The details in this book, taken from German and Russian archives make this a fascinating and useful book for the interested reader. I would go so far to say this book is essential reading necessary to understand sheer horror of modern warfare.The author strikes a welcomed balance between the indespensable details of troop movements, rivers crossed, towns captured and enemy troops killed and quoting extensively from participants on both sides, military, civilians and prisoners. Frankly without the quotes, many of which are very poignant and some of the black humor verity (Red Army sappers took pride in recycling the contents of unexploded shells. Their private motto was "One mistake and no more dinners") the story would not of been as interesting or as useful for this reader. Overlaying this narrative are chilling accounts from Hitler's bunker recorded by his inners circle of sycophants and equally eerie eyewitness accounts of Stalin cold and bloody prosecution of the war.Although extremely informative this is not a very pleasant book to read. It was upsetting to read about Russian Armies casual and extensive rape of Germany women.My hardbound edition features 15 pages of maps, glossary of terms, 49 pages of photographs, notes, bibliography and an index. Obviously a very useful book for individuals who wish to follow up on this topic."To the victor goes the spoils" and "you shall reap what you have sown" are two simple quotes that for this reader sums up this books conclusions.

"I must cite an intrinsic condition of the universe. We set forth in any direction which seems convenient; each leads to the same place: the end of the universe."Jack Vance"Marune: Alastor 933" (1975) is the second of three novels written by Jack Vance in his Alastor series. For those new to writings of Vance Alastor is a star cluster ruled by the mysterious and all knowing Connatic. Those stars with inhabited planets are named and numbered. Vance wrote three "Alastor" books the other two being Tullion: Alastor 2262 (1973) and Wyst: Alastor 1716 (1978).In "Marune: Alastor 933" a gentleman, a Mr. Pardero, finds himself at the spaceport on Brusetansel Alastor 1102 in the worst predicament imaginable: no identification and no memory of who he is, where he came from or where he's going. In a very logical manner Pardero, as he is named, is psychologically "matched" with a world and society within the Alastor Cluster.In short order Pardero finds himself to be a clan-king among the Rhune of Marune; Alastor 933. The Rhune, an isolated and clannish folk, are repulsed by the common display of animal functions [sex, eating etc], adhere to strict codes of behavior and maintain an elaborate feudal hierarchy. Marune; Alastor 933 is within a system of 4 stars, each a different color. The various combinations of solar illuminations have a direct effect on the Rhune behavior pattern. As with most Vance fiction resolution of the mystery of who stole his memory and for what purpose is interfused brilliantly with the fascinating cultures and societies that are a major charm of Vance's writing.

Ten man and ten women find themselves awakening from green coffin-like containers on an apparent alien world. After the initial surprise and panic the following facts are noted: although many different languages are spoken everyone understands one another and a well stocked super market and hotel are at their disposal. After a little exploration two other groups are discovered - cavemen and medieval knights. Also discovered is a high, cold wall of fog surrounding the entire area of confinement.The plot evolves with no surprises - initial exploration by the humans, contact with the other two cultures and penetration of the "barrier' to confront the manipulatorsThe story keeps your interest but this ground has been plowed before many times. I found Mr. Cooper's "surprise ending" contrived and melodramatic. Nonetheless some thoughtful sciene-fiction ideas - modestly entertaining.revised 2012-01-11

"Alexander Hamilton" - Ron ChernowThe following comments are for the abridged audio book on TAPE CASSETTES of "Alexander Hamilton" by Ron Chernow. Grover Gardner reads the book. Penguin Audio markets this item. This listener found the narrator, Grover Gardner, an excellent speaker whose clear pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too.There are many excellent reviews here on Amazon that discusses the content and details of the book. My remarks will be solely to advise perspective customers of quality, durability and usefulness of the AUDIO CASSETTE version on this title.When this title was released in 2004 I purchased the TAPE CASSETTE version. This abridged audio book consist 8 tape cassettes with a total playtime of approximately 11 hours. Each tape plays for 45 minutes on each side.I have just completed my third playing of this title. The quality of the audio has not deteriorated over the 7 years I have owned this title. In addition there were no mechanical malfunctions with the tapes. I do store my tapes carefully - returned to the storage container after use and fully rewound.TAPE CASSETTES have gone the way of the VHS videotapes - both useful and functional methods of recording data that have been replaced in the marketplace by the latest technology. The fact is that there are still many excellent books available on TAPE CASSETTES at rock bottom prices. If you have a CASSETTE player I would not hesitate to purchases these books; if the tape shells look clean and undamaged that a good sign they have been stored properly and should be fully functional.I have a nice "walkman" type CASSETTE player that I use while on the treadmill. After several hundred miles both the listener and the Walkman are still functional.

Two FBI agents visit a museum curator, a Ms Tallahassee Mitford a specialist in African artifacts, and request an appraisal of an enigmaticly designed container of considerable apparent antiquity. While awaiting the arrival of an Egyptian art expert the object is placed in a safe. We are informed that the item is radioactive.Through a convoluted set of circumstances the safe is opened, the box breached to reveal a glowing ankh that floats in the air. At this point, thunder erupts, the light go out, Ms Mitford, is "guided' to an Egyptian exhibit with a ancient "rod" festooned with cryptic designs. Rod and ankh touch and our female protagonist is teleported to ancient Africa to confront a corpse that has a striking resemblance to herself. A few pages later soldiers with guns land in a helicopter-like flying craft and thing get more comvoluted. Eventually we are informed that Ms Mitford has be transported to an "alternate-earth" cotangent with our earth but separated by a veil that can only be parted with mystical powers. To say any more would spoil the plot resolution for potential readers.I have read many of Ms Norton's novels and would recommend many other titles before this one. I found this book overly long, the plot unnecessarily convoluted and, well, just slow going and uninteresting at times. Nonetheless it is a book by Andre Norton so fans should read it!The blurb printed on my Fawcett Crest paperback stated "Hurled through time to an ancient kingdom. She became a warrior goddess-enemy of evil". That about sums it up.

In 1953 Holt, Rienhart and Winston published this title as part of their hardbound science fiction line geared towards young readers. Lester del Rey writing as Kenneth Wright was the author. I recall reading several of these Holt science-fiction juveniles in the 1950's and they inspired my lifelong interest in astronomy and space exploration. I wish I could recommend this title to new readers but what were once novel speculations of possible future events and discoveries reads today like so much hocus-pocus and outright nonsense. The passage of 50 years has not treated this book kindly. One saving grace is a subplot concerning the ageless question of either war or peace with the Aliens From Outer Space. For the dedicated fan of speculative fiction this is a classic example of 1950's science fiction with the emphasis on fiction.

It's 1968; you are 18 years old, fresh out of high school and decide to join the army because you know you'll be drafted anyways. During the Fall and Winter you complete your basic and advance infantry training. You have never handled a gun before so your trips to the shooting range were nerve-racking. After two weeks leave you're shipped off to Viet Nam. From the frigid mid-west you arrive to a steamy tropical jungle full of dangers: human and non-human. You are assigned to a platoon. Being the FNG (f****** new guy) with no survival skills no one wants to associate with you; troops assume you have very bad karma and are a bullet magnet. Soon after arriving you are part of a patrol sent into enemy territory. There is a noise in the jungle; a whoosh and the other guys hit the dirt. A muzzle flash in the bushes or in the trees means the enemy is firing on the platoon. What the solider does next is the subject of this book.Our imaginary solider could return fire, freeze with his face in the sand, or remain standing and become causality. The Army would like to believe that stateside training produces warriors but that was not always the case. Some soldiers shot their weapons indiscriminately giving away their position or in a panic even shot their mates. Some refused to fire. Some went crazy. Combat does very strange things to people and the effects are cumulative over time.Using surveys and interviews the author endeavors to finds answers to the conundrum of turning young men from normal American households into killers of fellow human beings. I am not anti-military or anti-war but we have to state exactly what is going on after all the euphemisms are removed.This book, published by the Navel Institute Press, is a scholarly work complete with an index, notes, bibliography and 29 tables and charts of survey statistics. The author for the most part avoids military jargon and writes for the general reader and not for fellow academics. Those with an interest in the Viet Nam War and how men perform and react, or don't react, when in combat will find this book interesting and useful.

"Magic in Ithkar 1"This anthology of shared fantasy world stories consist of 13 tales. Three noteworthy authors are represented in this, the first of four "Magic in Ithkar" collections; authors C.J. Cherryh and Andre Norton contribute a novelette and Lin Carter a short story. The remaining authors were unknown to this reader. The Norton story is the best of the group. To this reader it reads like a chapter out of a novel that Ms Norton never completed. Now this is just pure speculation on my part but I could imagine an author's agent saying something to the effect: "You know there are some great ideas in your story, here is an thought, we hire an editor, have him create a prologue about the Fair, Ithkar, the Three Lordly Ones and then advertise in the trade for stories 10 to 20 pages in length". Just speculation, but writing and publishing is a business after all. Nonetheless I found this an entertaining book to read. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the stories and how closely each author adhered to the world-view set down by the editor in the prologue. If you are interested in this book see my series summary listed below:PUBLISHING FACTS:The "Magic in Ithkar" book series consist of 4 titles: "Magic in Ithkar"; "Magic in Ithkar 2"; "Magic in Ithkar 3" and "Magic in Ithkar 4". The first, second and third books in the series were published as a trade paperback; subsequently they were published as a mass-market paperback. Books 4 was only published as a mass-market paperback edition. The books were published during the years 1985-7. The first three volumes had two editions and the last one edition. The last printing of any edition was 1987. Andre Norton and Robert Adams are listed as editors of all 4 books.THE BOOKS:All four volumes are anthologies of shared fantasy world stories. That is they all take place with a common background, which is detailed in a prologue. In fact each book starts with an identical 9 pages prologue by Robert Adams. We are informed that The Three Lordly Ones visited over four centuries age. As a result of this visitation and subsequent pilgrimages, a temple was erected and priesthood to services the worshipers evolved. A yearly fair around the temple provides mercantile opportunities for tradesmen and pilgrims alike. The location is earth-like but not our Earth. Having read all four books I can attest that all the stories, 55 in all, closely adhere to the fantasy world described in the prologue.Each volume includes a useful map of the Fair and the temple environs. At the end of the book is a short paragraph about the authors.THE AUTHORS:The vast majority of the authors are women and the leading role, as you would suspect, and mostly young ladies. The majority of the authors have many additional titles listed on their ISFDB page although I did find eight authors who have no other credits other that their Ithkar story.RECOMMENDATIONS:This is an interesting concept: create a fantasy world centered around a country fair combined with a pilgrimage, add in magic elements, religious conflicts, no technology, semi-feudal and agrarian elements. Most of the stories are good, and a few almost outstanding. Considering the dates of initial publication, 1985-7, even the 'name" authors were almost rookies. If this is your cup of tea I would recommend the series for your consideration and reading pleasure.

The following comments and observations are directed towards individuals who are curious about author Abraham Merritt or who are contemplating reading the Moon Pool. This title, a fantasy novel, was first published in 1919. The story line, farfetched as it is, is easy to summarize: good and evil fantasy beings and their followers live in caverns far underground that can only be entered through mysterious ancient ruins located on as island in the South Seas. Several explores enter the underground realm and become caught up in the supernatural goings on. The resolution, good triumphant over evil is never in doubt.The curious may ask then why is this 90-year-old novel by an unfamiliar author reprinted so many times? In my opinion it is the stylistic, ornate way Merritt describes supernatural events and everyday occurrences that rates this book a classic of fantasy. If you find the following quotes from The Moon Pool fascinating and enticing than you should read the book. If on the other hand you find them stuffed with quirky affectations then you should skip it."We were enveloped by a silence; a silence so intense, so - weighted that it seemed to have substance; an alien silence that seemed to cling and stifle and still stood aloof from us - the living. It was a stillness that might have followed the long tramping of millions into the grave; it was - paradoxical as it may be - filled with the withdrawal of life"."There issued apparently from the air around us, a peal of sound that might have been the shouting of some playful god hurling great suns through the net of stars. It was like the deepest notes of all the organs in the world combined in one summoning, majestic, cosmic! It held within it the thunder of the spheres rolling through the infinite, the birth song of suns made manifest in the womb of space; echoes of creation's supernal chord! It shook the body like a pulse from the heart of the universe - pulsed - they died away."I gave the book five stars so onward with the "supernal chord" and bring me another book by Abraham Merritt! By warned you may get hooked and want to read his other novels.

I found the way this book was organized very useful. The author leads us chronologically through the noteworthy events of the Nixon Presidency. The use of extensive sources and interviews provides the reader with eyewitness descriptions of what transpired.The documentation records of the Nixon presidency are staggering. I am not referring to the tapes, which are still not fully released, but the written record. We are told that when a meeting was held in the White House everyone in attendance had to submit a report of their observations and reactions. Anyone delinquent with his report would receive a reminder in the form of a terse memo from Halderman. In addition Halderman kept a detailed diary and Nixon was an obsessive note taker. The author uses these sources to intersperse the text with relevant quotes from Nixon and his associates. This could by sleep inducing but Mr. Reeves interjects an odd personal observation or quirky comment from one of the meeting participants to keep the narrative crisp and interesting.Mr. Reeves does not appear to have an ax to grind. The written records of the Nixon presidency speak volumes concerning the opinions of the decision makers. Certainly political considerations were critical components of all discussions and are presented, for the most part, without editorializing. Ultimately the President set the tone and the direction for his administration. Nixon's political scheming and personal behavioral quirks are facts and blaming the honest historians for 'distortions or bias" is just self-delusional.Students of American history, and in particular the presidency, should avail themselves of several of the other excellent books concerning the Nixon Era. I would recommend "Nixonland" by Rick Perlstein the two volumes Nixon biography by Stephan Ambrose. In addition Nixon authored several book concerning his political experiences. I have only read "In The Arena" and although self-serving does offer some relevant insights and astute comments on the presidency.

This book was written to accompany a ten part documentary series titled Russia's War. Although I have not seen the series I can assure potential readers that the book, by itself, is well worth acquiring and reading.The subtitle of this book is "A History of the Soviet War Effort: 1941-1945". Prior to reading this book I was unaware of the catastrophic effect the war had on Russian society.My overall impression after finishing this book was one of deep sadness that so many Russian people were either killed, enslaved or tortured not only as a result the War, but on the orders of the Communist leadership headed by Joseph Stalin. The author details the ebb and flow of battle along with a running commentary of how many Soviet citizens were sent to Siberia or to the firing squads. Stalin's paranoid delusions compounded the devastating effects of the War on the Russia people.The book has motivated me to seek out the films. I found the subject matter so captivating that to see the archival Soviet footage would be remarkable.

The following comments are for the cassette audio book version of A Prairie Home Companion 20th Anniversary Collection. The material presented are the original recording selected from 1974-94 Prairie Home Companion shows.The audio book consists of 4 standard tapes cassettes with a total run time of 6 hours. Each cassette plays 90 minuets; 45 minuets per side. Each side consists of a selection of songs and "News from Lake Wobegon" monologues. The songs and monologues on each tape side are taken from different shows during the twenty-year period 1974-94. Note these are not entire shows but cut and paste segments from various shows over twenty years.The packaging is as follows: on each tapes side is a listing of the song and monologue titles and the run times; the tapes are housed in standard audiocassette plastic boxes. An insert sleeve in the tape box lists the titles and credits per side. The four tape boxes slip into a four-sleeve fold out holder. The holder "face" identifies the tape number, track title, show date and show location. The four-sleeve holder folds over and slides into a cardboard slipcase. Also included is a 22-page booklet with photographs, interviews and comments by the cast. This is a well-constructed, very sturdypackage. I purchased my copy as a remainder in 2010 and it was "factory fresh" in every respect.To my delight the audio quality of the tapes after 16 years in storage were excellent.I listen to "Prairie Home Companion" very infrequently. It was a shear delight to play these tapes. The humor and music was just wonderful. Some of the "News from Lake Wobegon" segments were so funny I was in tears. Mr. Keillor and company is to be commended for this terrific collection.

I have read the three books collectively referred to as the "Lord of the Rings" twice, and seen the excellent films several times. Nonetheless I am aware that there is considerably more history and minutiae that are only referenced by obscure comments or difficult to understand footnotes that most people ignore.I found this modest book very helpful as an introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth. It is certainly not intended for scholars or hard-core fans. It does fit the nitch for readers that desire to know more but don't want a concordance. The style of this book clearly suggests it is geared towards the young adults readers.I found the manner in which the book was organized very helpful. The author's 35 chapters attempt to answer question we may have wanted to ask the author if we could of had a conversation with him. The following are a few of the chapter titles: "Who is Gandalf?"; "Was Gollum ever good?"; "Is The Lord of the Rings based upon WW2?"; and "Why Do Dwarfs and Elves Dislike Each Other?" The chapters are short, to the point and illustrated will several appropriate drawings or illustrations.An index and a bibliography add to the usefulness of this book.

"Skunk Works" published in 1994 is a non-fiction account of Lockheed's then ultra top secret aircraft designing and manufacturing facility located right off the main runway of the Burbank Ca airport. This is an excellent layman's account of the difficulties in fabricating and flying state-of-the-art aircraft such as the U-2 and the Stealth Fighter. The book includes many 1 to 3-page testimonies from test pilots, military officers and government officials concerning an aircraft's peculiarities or how it's "spy photos" assisted decision makers during an event or a crisis.Having read several accounts of the "U-2 incident" and certain Stealth raids this book provided me an insight as to the capabilities and the limitations of these aircraft.I would highly recommend this book to interested readers. I was previously unaware that the U-2 was used in Viet-Nam. My only negative is the fact that it's almost 20 years old - so 4 stars. As a history from the build and design side and from the pilot's cockpit it's a great read.

Talk about stepping into the way-back-machine! This audio cassette of two complete original broadcast of "The New Adventures of Sherlock Homes" will transport you back to 1945. Turn you dial to the Mutual broadcast network on your mental radio and relive the actual broadcast of two shows. Included are announcer introductions, commercials and at the conclusion an appeal to support the war effort by buying bonds. The announcer states that the broadcast is being sent out on the Armed Forces Network. The audio quality is excellent - no hiss, snaps or pops. These recordings must be from master tapes not a re-record of a broadcast. As an added bonus the principles are Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce who many consider the best Holmes and Watson combo.For those of us that just missed the Golden Age of radio dramas this tape will provided an excellent and entertaining introduction.
