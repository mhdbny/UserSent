Soul Groove "Formerly G-Funk 4-Ever"
B00000ERNX
I am not gonna front, this is my first EPMD album, but I do have Erick Sermon's first 2 (1993,1995)solos and his Insomnia comp from 1996, and I am a fan of his production. Erick Sermon's production does not dissapoint here either as he handles the lion's share. PMD handles a little as does Rockwilder contributing some co-production. There is a lot of deeper more lyrical East Coast rap out there, but there is room for some fun, beat driven funk, and these guys deliver no shortage of it. Much of the lyrical content includes boasting and flexing rap skills, calling out weak mc's, and a little doe doe smoke here and there. "Never Seen Before" really gives up the funk with a twangy soul sample. I like PMD's flow here, and the 2 show that they are still comin' hard on the mic. The remix is tangy laid-back funk PMD's rolling, funk inflected beat is bangin' on "Last Man Standing." Again, PMD's flow is on point, and the title is pretty self-explanatory. Erick Sermon does a pretty good job on the mic, though I prefer PMD's flow though. I like the Zapp "More Bounce To The Ounce" sample on the tight "You Gots 2 Chill '97," a remake to one of their earliest classics. They tell other mc's to chill because they will be shut down by EPMD's funk if they try to step to them. We get a neat Def Squad collabo with Redman and Keith Murray. Redman serves it as raw as ever; Erick Sermon steps his flow game up a bit here. Keith Murray as usual rips it to shreds with his cool, raspy rap voice. All four come correct as they once again flex their mic skills. The beat has a deep underground vibe. "Intrigued" has a cool funky underground vibe too. Das Efx keep it sewasidal and raw, and Drays and Skoob's flows are intact, a fun listen; Das Efx seems to steal the show here. "Jane 5" has an appropriate background Rick James sample, yet with a raw, old-school boom bap beat. I may not call this album a classic, but I thoroughly enjoyed rockin' this joint. It is a very fun and listenable banger by a duo with a complicated history. Nice to see them Back In Business here. I now need to cop their earlier material to see them at the top of their game.

Suga Free releases his third album, Just add Water, without the helping hand of DJ Quik. However, the producers lace him up with some of the hottest, smoothest, and bounciest G-Funk beats in many years. It's hard to find such decent beats these days. But, Suga Free also does his part; he drops relentlessly clever, on point rhymes throughout. He may take the pimpin' persona very far, but that's what he's known for; he is very charismatic, and that helps us get into his albums. All in all, this is an essential album to ride to, chill to, or to get the party pumpin.' This album is a little better than the New Testament because there are neater beats here.

Rough House Survivers are not a well-known group, but drop a mad heated album in 1992. I believe most of the members come from both the east and at least one from the west coast. Tony Dofat drops some serious beats that rival some of Premier's and Pete Rock's best beats. The production on this short album is simply incredible: bass infused boom bap with jazz breaks and horns with good drum and kick arrangements. Lyrically, the album has a lot of skill flexing and battle raps and serves as a great alternative to the club rap of today. "Can You Dig It?" has an incredible horn and keyboard arrangement and cool flows by the Rough House click, and CL Smooth comes by to bless the mic with his trademark slick butta flow. The vibe is mellow and sunny, a perfect cruising jam. The whole album sounds dope while crusin in the whip. "We Come To Get Wreck" is pretty self-explanatory, a nice skill flexing track. "So! Survivors We Can Rhyme" sounds like a Pete Rock beat (and sounds nice). The title joint is faster paced and is energetic. Sure, the east coast boom bap style was popular with mainstream artists in 1992 (and was very well done of course), but the underground artists like these definitely had a lot to add to the long lost, far gone golden era. This is one of those magic, true to hip hop, slept-on underground gems that heads need to dig below the surface for, and the hunt for these gems is fun because there are many more from this time period (i.e. Top Quality- Magnum Opus (1993) among many others) out there that were sadly slept on back then. Quit sleepin' and wake up son. These guys would only release a single or two in 1997-98, and that is all I know of from these talented guys.

Killa Kali's Steffon definitely came out with a unique album in 1994, Trippin' Wit No Luggage on Ruthless Records. This album is hardly ever spoken of, and I just heard of it in 2006, and I am a serious west coast hip hop head!! I definitely had to cop this one. Rhythm D produces the beats on this album and for the most part slap hard with that West Coastin' G-Funk. But don't think that the beats are just your typical P-Funk samples; they take on a life of their own. Rhythm D laces some unique beats. Peep the beat on "Jack Of All Trades" which is odd but lovable! The beat on "P Hop Hour" is unlike any other G-Funk beat I ever heard, very electronic; I cannot even describe it. Rhythm D does lace up one of his mob style beats on "I Can't Stand It." Some more dope G-Funk beats like "Young And Trippin'" and "Uncut Funk" have some hot high pitched whiny synths. Lyricwise, Steffon has a decent flow over the beats with a cool monotone voice which complements the music. He discusses issues like a brotha trying to fit in with the white folks and how he takes abuse from his brotha folks in "Frost Bit" with an airy funky beat. Many songs are lighter and good for house party like "Funk Like Me" and "Uncut Funk" and the interesting but oddly outta place old school Miami Booty Bass inflected "Steffon's In The House." Steff gets his throwback on in "Remember The Dayz" and drops some street knowledge and also spits some game for the youth about respect and education. Overall a hella dope album, different, so it may need to grow a little on you. But when it does, you'll see it as a definite banger!

1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics. Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor. The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here. "Make It Last" has the same lushness of songs like "You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)" from Round 2. "Payback Is A Dog" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony. "Love Comes Easy" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love. "Rockin' Roll Baby" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk. Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively. A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo "I Won't Give You Up." Then we have a great jam with the slower "Let Them Work It Out," which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying. The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties. A somber joint is "Could This Be The End." It is another slower joint with perfect harmony. Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue. Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others. The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.

4-Tay comes off sounding really tight on this one. He is very introspective and often pushes being positive. His rapping is excellent, as are his smooth twangy g-funk beats. It is a shame that he gets slept on. It sure beats that mainstream hip-hop of today. If you love rap abouts changing, learning, and growing, as well as some party jams, this is tight, his best c.d. ever! Be sure to check out these tracks: "I Paid My Dues", "Off Parole", "Boogie Bang Bang", and the harder "Still Ph----- Wit My Folk$!"

Remember the days when a party hip hop song was a true groove? Well, here is some of it from a wonderful time in hip-hop music. Showbiz and AG deliver with the primer 1992 EP to their perennial 1992 classic (and one of my favorite hip-hop albums): Runaway Slave. Party Groove/Soul Clap has 2 mixes of "Party Groove:" The Instrumental and the Bass mix. The beats are bangin boom bap with a beautiful jazz horn loop. Both versions are available on the Runaway Slave LP. "Soul Clap" has 2 versions: the short and off-beat mix. The short one is on Runaway Slave. The off beat has a slightly different drum beat but the same samples as the other. "Diggin' In The Crates" is not on the LP, for there is a harder edged boom bap follow up "Still Diggin.'" Diggin (Pt 1) is a joint repping' DITC with Diamond D, a cool more mellow jam with more jazzy melody. "Catchin Wreck," also from the LP is a self explanatory battle jam with a beautiful soulful loop. The James Brownish funk sample on "Giant in the Mental" along with DJ Premier's scratches provide a great backdrop for A.G. spittin' about making up for his lack of height with his hardcore mentality and slick rhyme play. This one is also not on the LP. The "Soul Clap" mix, the "Giant in the Mental," and "Diggin in the Crates" that are not on Runaway Slave are excellent hip hop material and essential for collectors and fans alike. So if you already have Runaway Slave and do not own this EP, you will absolutely not waste any money on purchasing the EP. Both the LP and EP are necessities in any true hip-hop head's collection.

Smokey Robinson has that type of hypnotic voice that carries so much emotion and passion when he croons. This collective has many of his balads from the 70's and a few from the 80's. Keep in mind, these songs are his solos with the exception of "Ebony Eyes" which is Rick James' song featuring him, so you will not hear the Miracles with him. My favorite track is "Agony And The Ecstasy" which digs deep in the soul, showing you have to pay dues in the game of love. "Cruisin" is another timeless classic from the late 70's, perfect for the top down rollin' down the block on a sunny 70 degree day! "Daylight And Darkness" is another smooth one with a relaxed keyboard driven beat taliking about a girl with a heavy dual personality; how she can be "bittersweet" as he puts it. He is intelligent, romantic, and sweet, all rolled into one. Mos def, it's perfect to play back at the crib with ya girl!!! Nice collection of hits!

1972 was a wonderful year for soul music; too bad I was not even born yet. The dramatics drop a debut album full of sweet harmony,and a mix of soft soul, quiet storm, and uplifting funk. The title jam has a nice funky, latin tinge to it and sounds hot while cruisin or chillin. "Get Up and Get Down" is a cool groovin' jam to shake and jive to. "Thank You for Your Love" is the firs of many slower jams here. I love the soft harmony and the sitar like guitar riffs. "In the Rain" is the quiet storm staple here with the thundering sound effects before the gorgeous guitar riff kick is. The dramatics sound so vulnerable and emotion ridden, which makes for some real good groovin here. "Gimme Some (Good Soul Music)" is another fun jam with those strings and harmonies. This song really applies today with the drought of really tasteful soul music (at least in comparison to the 60's and 70's). I also love the sexually charged "Hot Pants in the Summertime;" the vibe is hot and steamy with a cool harmony and a splash of soft, subtle funk. This song really applies now as I write the review (June) as the weather heats up for the summertime. "Hot Pants..." is the definitive, groovy summertime jams. "Fall in Love, Lady Love" is a wonderful ballad-type jam, and Mary Don't Cha Wanna is a cool mid-tempo jam. This is an incredible album full of different vibes and great harmony. This is the start of many 70's soul classics by the Dramatics. Their next several albums after this were also straight fire.

The Dramatics release an awesome 1973-74 album Dramatically Yours. The one thing I really love about this one is the sweet ballad type jams on here. The choruses are simply uplifting and beautiful. They really made some deep reaching songs here dealing with the many facets of the game of love like relationship difficulties and heartbreak in "I Made Myself Lonely" and "And I Panicked" (my favorite here), and the uplifting effect of having a mate "Beautiful Feeling." There are less straight funk jams than in 1972's Whatcha See Is What Ya Get, but it also easily recaptures the magic of the classic ballads of that one. What this means is that they dropped another classic soul album with their consistent harmony and deep grooves. Get this one on cd before it becomes rare; I am glad I did. This one and Whatcha See.... are both essential soul albums that should be in every RnB fan's collection.

The Impressions' This is My Country (1968) is basically my introduction to Curtis Mayfield along with his famed group. I am new to Mayfield's music because I did not grow up in that era (born in the 80's) but am growing in my interest for good soul music. Previously, I only had one solo work by Mayfield, the classic 1972 Superfly soundtrack. This album is a bit different than the Superfly OST; since downloading this album I have bought more Curtis solo albums and more Impressions albums. I really dig this groovy joint. There are the traditional Impressions' harmony rich love songs and ballads mostly in the slower-mid-tempo style. "Gone Away" is one of my favorites here. The call and response harmony is impeccable, a relic from their doo-wop early days, as is the prevalent whiny strings in the verses and ruffled strings in the hooks (a staple of late 60's and early 70's soul). The lyrics are heartfelt, and Mayfield's falsetto/tenor is vulnerable (as it is with the painful songs). "Love's Happening" is an upbeat, somewhat hippie vibin' cool jam. "I'm Loving Nothing" is more of a later-age doo-wop song with background humming and a slower tempo, a heartbreaker for sure. The Impressions do indeed dab into social commentary and race relations in songs like the string laden "They Don't Know," and the title track. The title track is a cool jam with great harmony and is lyrically self-explanatory, and there are references to the earlier days with slavery and the struggles in American society. All the songs are cool on this album, and I feel that there is no filler here. I am sure most older generations already have this album, but if you are younger like me, it is good to check out our musical heritage because this music really resonates.

This album is da bomb! I bump this everyday. I love the smooth g-funk sounds and the strong rhyming. This is one of the best rap c.d.'s I have ever bought. If you love that Cali flava, then this is a must have. Gangsta Luv Pt. II is off the hook, and so is All Day Everyday, and so is just about everything else on it. Buy this album!

1994 was a high point in rap music, and this soundtrack proves it. The West Coast was at its high back then. This record features some of the dopest G-Funk selections. Snoop, Tray Dee kill it on "21 Jumpstreet" takin it back to growin up on 2-1. The beat itself is classic, laidback with a relaxing keyboard riff throughout the song. Tha Dogg Pound brings heat on "What Would You Do" with a bouncy, yet hard-core beat, perfect to lowride to. "Who Got Some Gangsta S---" is another banger, with Snoop, DPG, Swoop G and Lil C Style, with a smokin beat and killa rhymes. Quik's "Dollaz and Sense" also on his Safe + Sound LP, also bangs; I am also a fan of MC Eiht, but you got to admit, Quik's diss is hella hard, and the beat is hot. The R&B tracks range from o.k. to dope, like the neat DPG and Jodeci collabo, "Come Up To My Room," but I mostly bought this album for the G-Funk. "The Eulogy" with Slip Capone and CPO is menacing. The rap tracks bring the same magic as The Chronic and Doggystyle did in the last 2 years before this soundtrack.

These dudes keep deliverin with their albums, and this one is no different. 1997's Usual Suspects is fully heated with that Rap-A-Lot O.G. flava that made 1995's Rated G and 1994's Gangsta Funk classics (I still have not heard Ghetto Dope yet, but plan on checkin' it though). This album is rich with awesome, smooth funky beats mixing southern-fried twang and G-Funk melody, with polished hook vocals on many. Production goes to the Boyz themselves, Mike Dean, and Scarface. I like the menacing "Gangsta Sh--" with Spice 1 and Mr. Slim with neat heavy bass and sporadic twangs. This album is gangsta mixed in with some social commentary, some uplifting messages, and some hustler tales. I love the slick and smooth Suave House vibin' "F--- Strugglin'" with Eightball and MJG and the Boyz kickin some hustla game. "Live Your Life" is thumpin with some deep guitar twang and airy keyboards and sexy female hook vocals. This joint is a coming of age tale for them growin up in the 5th Ward, and the other theme of the song is evident in the title. Mike Dean's beat here is awesome. Scarface's beat on the socially conscious "I Know" is hella chill and beautiful. They keep it real in the hood here and rap about how not to let others get you down. The hook channels Marvin Gaye's "Inner City Blues" but is optimistic about better times coming. "Mama's Praying" is serious nature and is basically self-explanatory. Mama is praying for the survival and better life for her children. The beat is soulful and twangy. The Boyz take a harsher turn on "Got II Be Down II Die" where they "let the devil know [they're] comin.'" The beat is slower but menacing and has that background crackling sound many producers use for an old-school vibe. The you hear a screwed voice saying "I may be scared of jason, but I'm not scared to die" that gives off an eerie vibe. Then we got somethin for the playas and riders, the chill "Somethin' To Ride To" which is cool and mellow featuring Chicago's Rap-A-Lot trio Do Or Die and Rap-A-Lot RnB artist Johnny P's cool hook vocals. 5th Ward Boyz adapt their rapping style very well to match Do Or Die's rapid-fire delivery. All in all, this album is as good as any other 5th Ward Boyz album that I have heard so far(again, I have not yet heard 1992's Ghetto Dope). To me, this album is a classic underappreciated banger from H-Town. any Scarface or Geto Boys fan who doesn't already have this one will dig it.

The Chi-Lites are a fantastic soul group with sky high heavenly harmony and a wonderful, make-you-melt falsetto/tenor by Eugene Record. 1972's A Lonely Man is the epitome of soft, ballad soul. I love the strings and sweet melody of all the songs here. Each song is a winner, and there are a few here that are among my favorite soul jams all together. "Oh Girl" is one of those emotionally charged ballads that will make you tear up, even the hardest of the hard will well up to this one. The song shows the vulnerability of a man who worries about a woman leaving him and what he would do if she did. I love the harmonica, which adds to the emotional depth of the song. "A Lonely Man" is one of those 6 minute ballads that will also melt your heart, and perfectly exemplifies the perfect vocal harmony. This song is a little similar in tone and vibe to "Have You Seen Her" (1971) with the harmony and balladry of the song. "Love Is" is a song defining the aspects of true love based on how people act, yet again another beautiful jam. A noticeable difference between this and the previous album, 1971's (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People" is that there is less upbeat funk here, and more balladry (I am more of a fan of ballad/soft soul FYI: though that other album is another winner IMO). Any one who loves the Delfonics (my fav group), The Stylistics, The Spinners.... will absolutely love the Chi-Lites. This album definitely shows a soul group at its best. This remaster cd is well-done with awesome sound quality. This record showcases an immensely talented group from Chicago. It will remind you of the ballad soul of Philly soul. I guess most people who grew up in the 70's to the soul explosion probably already have had the album for decades and loved it, but young people could definitely groove to this classy soul. From the mind of a young 20 something, your parents and elders DO know what great music really is. For any hip-hop heads out there, Paul Wall, a Houston rapper, has a laid back song called "Girl" which samples "Oh Girl."

1992, Above The Law records an album that would help change the game on the west coast for the better; they definitely had a huge hand in the wildfire spread of G-Funk on the west and also, the south because many producers down south drew upon G-Funk's influence and popularized their own deep fried beats with deep groove funk too. But as for Black Mafia Life, Cold 187 um definitely gave up the funk with those P-Funk samples. Lyrically, the album is dope with killa flows from 187 and KMG. "V.S.O.P." slaps with sophisticated funk using a beat pattern similar to One Way's Cutie Pie, and a horn that reminds me of Tom Tom Club's "Genius Of Love," but 187 definitely gave it his own spin; this is my favorite joint here; these cats trade relentless spits over that sick beat! Get ya drank On to this one! 2Pac and Money B from the biggady bay trade verses with ATL over a P-Funk style beat on "Call It What U Want," perfect for one of those house parties. Eazy-E and Kokane come to kick it on "Game Wreck-Oniz-Iz Game" with the tripped out space alien, cosmic boogie funk beat. "Process Of Elimination..." is definitely on the gangster tip. ATL kicks in the door with some relentless venomous flows. ATL battles their egos and blames them for some of tehir problems on "Mee Vs. My Ego" with some tripped out funk with a crazy rasta verse towards the end of the song. This album should have been given more props for helping start the G-Funk craze of the early and mid 90's.

Its comps like these that allow younger generations (like mine) to hear true RnB music the way it was, and the comps make the music much more accesible. This comp, part one, spans from the first singles in 1968 through the first half of 1973's Letter to Myself (The second half is on Part II. The Chi-Lites are one of my favorite soul groups. Here we have the 1968 singles: "Love Me" is a groovy uptempo Motown style swinger. "Love is Gone" is one of my favorite Chi-Lites songs. Listen to Eugene Records's pain in the song, and the awesome strings and funky subtle guitar riffs. This song reminds me more of the Philly soul style that was about to explode on the scene. "(Um, Um) My Baby Loves Me" is a cool upbeat funky jam to cruise to, and "Price of Love" has a throwback to the early-mid 60's sound with the doo-wop influenced horns, and Motown uptempo style reminiscent of the Four Tops. "Baby it's Time" reminds me of early 60's doo wop with the harmony, but also with the upbeat tempo. That wraps up the 1968 singles. Then we have 1969's Give it Away, a classic album with some rock and psychedelic influences balanced with soft-soul (shows their well-rounded style!!). "What Do I Wish For" has thoise multi-layered strings and sweet guitar riffs. 1970's I Like Your Lovin' (Do You Like Mine?) has a harder edge to it with more rock and psychedelic influences: the title trach is a fun song with that harder-hitting edge, another perfect cruisin jam! I love how the bass and falsettos offset eachother here. 1971's (For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People has the perennial classic ballad "Have You Seen Her," and the uptempo, funky, socially aware title track. Then there is 1972's classic album: A Lonely Man, with the ballad laden title track recalling the magic of "Have You Seen Her," and the other famous groove, "Oh Girl;" this album relies more on soft-soul than uptempo funk of the predecessors. Then the first half of A Letter to Myself ends the comp. Record's falsetto shines really strong on "Someone Else's Arms," and he reaches some high notes on the soft and sad mid tempo joint. I thank Brunswick records for delivering the classics so a younger guy likeme can have access to the music when music was music. Vol 2 is also highly recommended, covering A Letter to Myself (side B), through 1975's Half a Love and 1975-1976 singles to round off the collection.

This album is unbelievable. It is a union of slow, laid back funky beats (often bordering on R&B) and hard core rhyming. Ain't No Luv Lost is the epitome of Cali g-funk. If you love music you can bump in the drop top, with the top down of course, this one's for you! It's perfect for one of those famed sunny Cali days! The best song is #5, "I Won't Go Down" because the beat and rhyming are the strongest. But be sure to check out the other 9 tracks. Cop this one!!

With only singles and appearances between 1996's Ridin' Dirty and this one in 2001, there was definitely time for UGK to serve an dope album. The game has drastically changed from 1996, when UGK's Pimp C produced funky beats that often drew upon the influence of G-Funk which was big back then. Pimp C and other southern beatsmiths like N.O. Joe and Mike Dean among others definitely go in step with the time lacing bouncy southern beats while still maintaining a Swang and Bang atmosphere that was created years ago, but updated for the new millenium. This album often takes more of a mainstream approach in tracks like "Money, Hoes, & Power" produced by Jermaine Dupri, and "Gold Grill," but they still want you to know they rule the underground in bangers like "Wood Wheel," a dope beat by Pimp C and John Bido, a perfect rider anthem for those caddies sittin on d's and 16 switches. The beat recalls the beat on the Geto Boys Intro and Outro tracks on 1993's 'Til Death Do Us Part." "Choppin' Blades" is real hot. The beat samples a speedy version of E-40's "Captain Save a Hoe" with a ounce of southern bounce. "Ain't That a Bi--h (Ask Yourself)" is a classic feat. Devin The Dude with a relaxing G-Funk inspired beat, a classic N.O. Joe beat; the only thing that sucks about it is that it is edited and the expletives are not filled in with alternate words, so you hear pauses in the lyrics but thankfully not in the beat. "PA N---a" has an odd synth beat by N.O. Joe, but it has definite slappage value; Bun N Pimp get it crunk while representing Port Arthur Texas. Bun B and Pimp C definitely have not lost a step as lyricists. The production and the rhymes definitely stand out in 2001, a year that many rappers went too mainstream. Bun N Pimp may cater a little for the mainstream, and that's fine, but they do not overdo it for the underground heads!!!

AmeriKKKa's Nightmare is arguable S.P.I's best album, if not, it's tied with his self-titled '92 heater. Over top notch beats coutresy of Blackjack, Ant Banks, Battlecat, and others, Spice 1 kills the tracks with his mentally insane and killer flows. The cat can really flow! It's tight when he starts rappin with a Jamaican voice in some hooks and verses in tracks like "Face Of A Desparate Man." The songs are laced with some awesome G-Funk beats. Battlecat creates fire on "Bustas Can't See Me;" it's perfect for gettin ya ride on down the ave. Ant Banks laces up Spice 1 with a banger in "Give The "G" Gat" The beat on "You Can Get The Gat" has more of an underground early 90's east coast beat paired with murderous rhymes; it is one of the darkest, hardest, most menacing tracks in rap music. Spice 1 takes gangsta rap to a whole new level with this and all his early albums.

The Moonglows are a truly interesting soul group from the doo-wop/early rock era. Look, It's The Moonglows from circa 1959 is an album full of soulful tunes with carefully crafted poetic lyrics and sweet harmonic backdrops from as early as 1955 or so up to the late 50's when the album was released. The album has a few different styles of songs. First, there are many memorable slow drag doo wop classics. I love "Sweeter Than Words" with a haunting, flawless harmony with a beautiful guitar driven beat and piano melody, a really classy number. In fact, most of the songs, especially the slow jams are of the highest classiness: beautiful symphonic melogy and sophisticated strings (on some), and slow guitar licks, which create a delicate, laidback atmosphere. The Ten Commandments of Love is another slow jam with spoken verse sprinkled amidst the singing of the commandments. "I'll Stop Wanting You" features some beautiful strings and melodies and truly poetic lyrics about the supernatural phenomena that would stop a man from loving his woman. "When I'm With You" is a true doo-wop gem. I love the harmonic "wee ooh wee ooh wee ooh's" and the echoing "my head keeps spinning, spinning, spinning" adding to the poetic lyrics about the power of a woman's love and mere presence in a man's life. On the other side of the coin, there are more upbeat, faster rock infused jams: there is the uptempo bluesy "Mean Old Blues." "Cold Feet" is a nice early rock-n-roll jam about the uneasiness a man has within his relationship. "Kiss Me Baby" is even more upbeat and uptempo with a swinging cool vibe for the dance floor. "Blue Velvet" is a really silky, smooth song, another real slow song for a classy dance. "Penny Arcade" is a nice story type song which involves old gypsies ladies telling fortunes of love. "Love is a River" also has those gorgeous strings, a sweet romantic song. To sum it up, this album is a gem. The Moonglows are truly a class act. Anyone wishing to explore the roots of true poetic soul music that would follow in the 60's and 70's should also check for the Moonglows from the 50's. These gentlemen are some of the original slow drag balladeers. The songs are carefully laidout and the vocals and harmonies are simply divine. The 1990 cd issue is pretty good in sound quality, especially since some of the songs are 55 years old, and the album itself is 50 years old. Man, not only are the songs awesome here, but even the group's name: The Moonglows, is a classy, cool name for a soul group. The cd reissue is OOP: be sure to snatch it up before the price skyrockets.

In the Mid-90's, There were a hot bed of rappers that hit the G-Funk bandwagon. Warren G was one for sure. But I have to say, he has just the right personality to make it big. He is intelligent, reflective, fun to listen to, and has a good, rhythmic flow. He spends less time cussing, and more time reflecting on life, having fun, and surviving in Long Beach, Ca. For only having 12 tracks (2 being skits), there is little room for filler. No problem, there is no filler here, just vintage west coastin' beats and awesome rhymes from G-Dub. G-Dub is a great storyteller. Every joint is the bomb! "So Many Ways" to me, is a nice lyrical joint where G-Dub and the Twinz wreck shop and buck down wanna be's over a sunshine gold'd's and palm tree's style beat that made 1994 my favorite year in rap. This album stands as one of them that made me a passionate G-Funk fan. This album is the definitive G-Funk album in my opinion! "And Ya Don't Stop" took awhile to grow on me, but the sweet beat took over and Warren's dope flow had me shook! He may not break new ground in a lyrical sense, but I love his flow, and his lyrics bring me to when hip-hop was tight; Warren G is hip-hop, and he shows it throughout. "This DJ" is the laidback party jam with the sweet whiny synth and smoked out beat. "What's Next" gets it a lil more gangsta with Warren G and Malik trading spitfires over yet another sweet sunny beat. Warren produces his own beats here, and his beats are among the best in the industry, especially here. How could any serious head hate on a joint like this one. Any hip hop heads should have this in their rap collection.

Above The Law has a neat and varied catalogue of music ranging from Livin' Like Hustlers 1990 to Forever: Rich Thugs Book 1 in 1999. They released some awesome, and often under the radar stuff, and helped change the rap game in the 1990's. Legends is their 1998 album after Uncle Sam's Curse (1994) and Time Will Reveal (1996). Cold 187 um continues his scientific beat experiments here as he did on all the ATL albums. I gotta say, his G-Funk beats definitely are original, not like many other producers. The beats are different here than any of the other beats I have ever heard. Lyrically, the album is definitely a ATL album! Now, they don't break any new ground; that was Uncle Sam's Curse's job, but this album is definitely enjoyable. Joints like "X.O. Wit Me" thump with a dope lowrider beat and ATL and Jayo Felony trading fire. "The Streets" is one of my favorite ATL joints ever with a nice laid back melodic beat with a nice Hawaiian motif in the background; perfect to tear the streets up or hit 3 wheel motion. "Soul Searchin'" definitely bangs with a beat only 187 can create, a nice twangy beat KMG trading verses with Yukmouth of Luniz fame with a nice female vocal chanting "can you see the light." The track drops intelligent street knowledge with some voodoo imagery while taking a look at their own souls. Some beats here are likably oddball, very original and experimental like "L.A. Vibe," the eerie hood anthem "Set Trippin,'" and "Karma;" just try to beat box to the latter; you simply can't because there is so much electgronic madness goin on there. "Adventures Of..." is interesting. Nicole Hithe drops some interesting and hella sexy hook vocals and some pimpin' verses that ATL are well-known for with another original beat. "In God We Trust" is what I believe, a bonus track. The song slaps with a heavy beat and a neat middle eastern motif. ATL kill the track with killa street flows. Beatwise, this album is as experimantal as any of their older albums. Definitely open your mind and please give this album a try! Get it before it sells for 70 bucks like Uncle Sam's Curse.

UGK has been doin' their thing since the late 80's, and since then UGKworked hard representing the South Texas rap scene. In the mid-late 90's, they finally gained some mainstream attention with 1996's Ridin' Dirty, a classic showcase of their skills. 1992's Too Hard To Swallow is one hard bangin' album. Most production goes to the late, great Pimp C with Bun B and Bismark adding some here and there, creating a deep, syrupy, southern fried soundtrack to spit over. "Pocket Full of Stones" is an early crunk classic with a deep rollin' funky beat and thick bass. Many may remember it from the 1993 soundtrack Menace II Society. "Pocket..." was also remixed with a sweet beat and censored lyrics in 1993 (Included on 2002's Side Hustles comp.) and there was a dope part 2 on 1994's classic Super Tight... Many of the other songs here also deal with slanging and using drugs like "Cocaine in the Back of the Ride," and "Feel Like I'm the one Who's Doin' Dope," and those jams have a hard core, dramatic soundscape for the rough lyrics. Those styles of beats would become standards in the early crunk movement that would soon ensue. The title track takes a more mellow approach but still with hard lyrics. The beat is similar more to twangy pre-early-G-Funk. "Use Me Up" is mid-tempo funk with lyrics dealing with being used (or in Pimp C's words "pimped") by women. There are dirty songs like the horny "976-Bub B." One misstep which could be easily skipped over is "Cramping My Style" with an overused and derivative Isley Brothers "Between The Sheets" (1983) sample, and as for the guest Infinity, I am not crazy about her verse. I would have to say that "Pocket Full Of Stones" and "It's Too Hard To Swallow" are my favorite 2 here. Fans of true gangsta style rap and hard core lyrics will definitely love this joint that came out in an era well before gangsta rap was watered down with RnB diva hooks and club beats. It took quite a while before UGK ever got mainstream attention, which they clearly deserved much earlier.

I know that many feel that these two albums were a little too juvenile, and that is why many look to their mid sixties albums for their more mature, yet still young and fun sound. I really love vibing and cruising to this two-fer. I feel like a kid again when listening to the albums. 1962's Surfin' Safari, I feel, has some great tunes. I love "Surfin,'" one of their very first recordings from 1961. I love the harmony and uptempo music and vocals. They do a decent cover of Eddie Cochran's 1958 classic "Summertime Blues." They can also doo-wop pretty well on "Little Girl (You're My Miss America)." I will admit that I find "Ten Little Indians" a little too silly for my tastes, but I do like the music and harmony. "Chug-A-Lug" is a little silly as well, but it is better than "Ten Little Indians," and it is a song about guys chasing girls comparing what they have under the hood of their cars, and naturally heading up to the root-beer stand and gulpin' the carbonated beverage. I think it is a fun song, and I blare it in my car when driving. I love "409," one of the many racing car songs the Beach Boys would record, which would also influence the then folkier Jan and Dean to expand their horizons in short order. the title track is another fun surfing song, and highlights them honing in their signature harmony. Though the album has some misteps, I totally love this album, and shows that the Boys are having so much fun recording it. Music can be lyrical and complex, or simple and fun like this. 1963's Surfin' USA is similar, but has many more instrumentals, and is also fun. The instrumentals are "Let's Go Trippin'" a cover of Dick Dale and the Del-Tones' famous instrumental from circa 1961; there is also Bill Doggett's "Honky Tonk." The Beach Boys also create their own instrumentals like "Surf Jam," which is guitar-driving, adrenaline pumping fun. I love the Chuck Berry musical composition on "Surfin' USA," of course with surf lyrics. Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen" is totally transformed into a new classic. In fact, So many of the musical elements found in their music is indebted to Berry's rollicking rock-n-roll stylistics. Are the beach boys juvenile in the first couple of albums? Sure, but that is because they are really young, having fun, and are developing their sound. I believe it takes nearly nothing from the pleasure of listening to their music, and often adds to it. I truly take my passion for hearing music seriously, and I seriously enjoy the fun sound of the Beach Boys, especially when day-dreaming of my kid days while stuck in traffic going to or from work. These 2 albums and their ensuing albums have along lasting legacy in music, for their sounds have been emulated in so many movies and shows that have scenes at the beach. Just sit back or cruise and enjoy the soundtrack of youth and reminisce.

Str8-G is a little known rapper from L.A. I believe (he talks a lot about chillin in the east too), and records an album for A&M Records in 1994, and the album is released in January of 1995 seemingly to little fanfare. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it does have its moments. Boogiemen do a nice chunk of the production along with some by Str8-G himself, and some by Dazzie Dee, Clint "Payback" Sands, and a remix by DJ Quik. For the most part, the beats are good, some awesome, save for a joint or two. The vibe is a mix of Cali G-Funk mixed in with some raw heavy East Coast underground bass and jazz horns. Lyrically, his flow is decent, but his topics bring little to the table. However, in some joints his lyrics bring a cool vibe along with the music. I love the chill "Everything's Fine (In The Summertime)" which employs heavy keyboard melody, slow, rollin' bass, and jazz horns for a sweet G-Funk classic. "Shadow Of A G" is menacing with some hard Dr. Dre influenced mobbin bass. The remix is more relaxing beatwise with a nice guitar twang with barry White steppin' in. "Bring The Funk" is vintage P-Funk inflected G-Funk, and is a good house party joint. DJ Quik does a remix for the song too. His beat is unreal. The guitar riffs, the whiny synths and his awesome talkbox make this song a fun uplifter. Str8-G and Quik have some good chemistry, for G can rap good over Quik's beats. An unnecessary joint here is "Pu--y Today" which is boring and unimaginitive. I can only listen to so many sex rap joints. The beat "Wild Trip" has an interesting menacing beat, and his flow and rapping voice is dope here. "Drama" is another hard joint with a beat reminiscent of heavy bass Erick Sermon funk. All in all, this album is dope. If he had more of a presence on the mic that stood him apart from other G-Funk artists from the time, this may have been a classic; still, this is a definite good listen.

The 1980 classic debut album by Zapp, with production by Roger Troutman and Bootsy Collins (of P-Funk fame)is a one-way trip to funkville. The 9 minute classic "More Bounce To The Ounce" introduces the world to Roger's trademark talkbox over a deep-groove lowrider ready beat. If you live in So. Cali, you'll hear this jam blaring out of Impalas' sound systems sittin on D's. The song does not have many lyrics except for a hook and some phrases here and there, a trademark of many of Zapp's jams. Those type songs are reserved for groovin' on the dancefloor, and are perfect as they are. I love the uptempo twangy, guitar-ridden groove. It is easy to hear a P-Funk influence here. There is an element of soul in the jam "Be Alright." It has a slightly softer vibe and has nice harmony and is cool for chilin' with ya boo. Of course, this song regained infamy as it was sampled in 2Pac's classic hip-hop joint "Keep Ya Head Up" from 1993. "Brand New Player" is a cool, twangy swingin' joint about a cat who is cool and has mad mack for the ladies. I love the jazzy hook with the ladies harmonizing. More talkbox madness abounds on "Funky Bounce," a self-explanatory jam which is tailormade for the disco clubs of the early 80's. "Coming Home" is a faster-paced harmonica laden jam that is for getting with the ladies. Zapp ruled the 80's with their deep-groove funk and dance floor ready numbers, and that all started here with this bangin' debut. Fans of P-Funk should definitely check for this one provided such fans have not already had this in their collections for decades.

In mid 1996, Mr. Mike, member of South Circle reppin' Houston and Suave House Records, gets his chance to go solo. He really goes all out here with wicked flows and sick gangsta rhymes. And, he is backed with excellent production. E-A-Ski and CMT, underrated producers from Oakland, Cali handles 40 percent of the beats, and Suave House (T-Mix) handles the rest. The beats have a mix of psycho funk and melodic G-Funk that will bang hard in the ride. This dude can spit. His style is hard core gangster, so fans of C-Bo, Spice 1, Scarface, DMG, Mac Mall should check for this one. There are a few laidback ones here too. "Where Ya Love At" is a fantastic G-Funker with E-A-Ski delivering a sunny, chill west coast backdrop with a nice whiny synth, and Mr. Mike drops some serious philosophy about life here. He brags flosses a little on the cool and breezy "Untouchable." The beat is also sunny and laidback with Suave House on the boards. Mr. Mike flexes his mic skills on "Can You Feel Me." The beat is menacing and hard mob funk. E-A-Ski and Mr. Mike show why the South-West connection ain't nathan nice on "Southwest" with a twangy E-A-Ski and CMT beat catered for both Texas and Cali styles. Again, the south-west connection fires up with Ice Cube steppin by on the title track to spit some more gangsta game. The beat is vintage Suave House G-Funk. I think it is cool how great southern rappers and west coast rappers collaborate because there is a similar general mentality between them, and they often have good chemistry. As Ice Cube puts it cleverly, "the westside's always been down with the south." Mike kicks some more harsh game on "G's Perspective" with a sick G-Funk beat perfect to roll to. Eightball and MJG show up on the last track on "Stop Lying" to warn heads about where their mouth could get them over a southern, deep-twangy meets space boogie suave banger beat. Any fans of west coast G-Funk, twisted gangsta rap, southern fried funk, and talented flow spitters should seriously consider this classic, if they don't already have it.

Coolio came out again in 1995 with the hit "Gangsta's Paradise" on the Dangerous Minds soundtrack. He then released his second album taking the same name. This album has some special meaning for me. It was only the second rap album I bought ever. The album is a fun pop-mainstream-style album full of great production and beats, and some nice rhymes by Coolio. Beatwise, the album is full of that Cali G-Funk courtesy of "Wino," Vic C, and many lesser-known producers, way too many to list here. "Gangsta's Paradise" is obviously a hit, but there are many other classics here too. "Is This Me" is hella twangy feat. Rated R from Thug Life discussing the hold the streets take on people who get caught up in that life. Coolio shows some love and respect for the women on "For My Sistas." "Sumpin' New" is just a plain good time at the club over a bouncy P-Funk sampled type beat, as fun as "Fantastic Voyage" from 1994. "Get Up Get Down" features longtime homie WC and homegirl Malika. The beat is smooth and swingin. "The Revolution" is hot with a bouncy lowrider beat dealing with social issues. "Bright As The Sun" is a track where the imagery brings up a helicopter (ghetto bird) has its bright lights searching for him over a woozy, twangy beat. I love "Exercise Yo' Game" with Coolio trading spits with Kam, E-40, and 40 Thevz, which has an oddball, but phat beat. I love the hooter and licqor joint "Kinda High Kinda Drunk" with another odd but tight beat. Coolio has some positive messages in many tracks. He has fun, but he also can bring up some serious, often sad, imagery on tracks like "Geto Highlites" which is basically what it is, runs like a news report in parts of the songs. The album brings back memories of growing up for me. I see many hating on the album for being too pop, but I disagree, it is a nice album regardless.

Above The Law has came out with album after album that changed the game each time. This one from 1996 is no different. The whole album is G-Funk, but do not think for one minute that is that generic P-Funk sampling that you hear hundreds emulate. Don't get it twisted; I love the P-Funk samples; they make for dope beats, but Cold 187um flips the script. His beats are always different than the other producers, and they are different on every ATL album! He experiments heavily and makes those off the beaten path boogie beats that bang! Now, the lyrics here are hella different from Uncle Sam's Curse from 1994. USC was politically heated, and this one is on the smooth pimpin tip. "Gorilla Pimp" is a prime example with a slammin' semi-southern fried inspired beat. Another pimp style song is "Clinic 2000" which is smooth and different beatwise. It seems to be a sequel to "Pimp Clinic" from Black Mafia Life. "Evil That Men Do" sorta reverts to more of a gangsta mentality, and is hella tight. The beat slaps hard with that L.A. style bounce. Another certified banger is "City Of Angels" remix with Frost. I love songs that represent for rappers hoods, and this one definitely puts it down for L.A. over a mid-tempo lowrider style beat. A good track to lay back and blow a sack to is "Endonesia" with a keyboard melody ridden lovably oddball beat. This album definitely is different musically, and shows another aspect of G-Funk. G-Funk is not as simple as many put it- P-Funk samples and gangbanger rhymes. Cold 187um definitely deserves a place in the rap hall-of-fame for his production skills.

After his success with "Gangsta's Paradise" from 1995-96, he comes back in summer of 1997 with My Soul, another dope album from Coolio. Many say he is too pop, but regardless, I enjoy him. He has a dope rap voice, and I do like his style, and he has great producers behind him. Sonically, this album is somewhat similar to Gangsta's Paradise, full of great G-Funk beats that are perfect for the ride. Wino and Vic C handle a couple songs, and Romeo, who handled much of Gangsta's.... handled a huge part of this one too. This album is definitely a good party album, for the beats and lyrics on many tracks reflect a fun vibe. "One Mo" (with 40 Thevz) is one for sure, a dope lowrider joint with a bouncy beat and a great vocoder riff in the hook. "Ooh La La" is a bump and grind sex joint with a phat funky beat, and "Throwdown 2000" is a nice party jam with a P-Funk type beat as is "Can I Get Down 1X;" both are also great for a nice 3 wheel motion ride! "Knight Fall" is a bit darker with more serious lyrics and a bit more pessimistic. "Homeboy" features Montell Jordan in the hook, and is awesome. Coolio wants to send some love to the homies, and he wants you to do the same. The beat is relaxing with a nice twangy riff. Coolio wants to keep in touch with his soul on the title track with a nice relaxing guitar ridden beat. C U When U Get There (w/ 40 Thevz) is serious and socially aware. The beat is fantstic with good vocal backing in the hook. Overall, this album is awesome, and fun to listen to. Definitely, this one is a party starter, with a couple more serious tracks.

1998, Fat Pat is killed a few weeks before the release of his first album, this one, Ghetto Dreams. This album is a balance of beautiful beats and fun loving lyrics, with a few serious joints. Knoke D and Double D produce the extremely high-quality beats here, and they are simply amazing. Generally, they are laidback smooth, but at times, bouncy Texas funk, and many of the joints draw a heavy influence from crunk and G-Funk. Fat Pat has a dope flow and neat deep voice. His rap topics may not be groundbreaking, and some hint at mainstream tendencies, but he is fun to listen to. The stuff today is played out compared to what's on here. This album is a dope gangsta party joint. The title track is fun, multi-layered, melodic funk. Pat flosses hard, but lets it be known that he had no hand-outs and had to really work hard to get where he did. Pat gets his mack on in joints like the Isley inflected "Peep N' Me." He flosses his mack more on the lowrider ready "I'm Tha Man" with the fellow Wreckshop homies Pimp Tyte. The beat is heavy G-Funk with a faint keyboard melody in the background. You can hear Biggie's sampled voice: "I'm the man girlfriend" from "Big Poppa." "Reality" is a straight banger dropping knowledge of the endless cycle of hood life and how he wants a different path for himself. The beat has a west coast beat pattern and a keyboard melody reminiscent of Snoop Dogg's "Who Got The Gangsta S---" from the 1994 west coast classic soundtrack Murder Was The Case. "Tops Drop" is a heavy electro-funk joint ready for the lowriders. "Friends We Know" has a sunny beat and discusses how homies can turn on you in a second. "Body Roc" seems like Fat Pat's fun, light hearted party remake of Bone Thug's 1997 joint "Body Rott" with an upbeat melody and crunkish bounce. A sad joint is the soft, sweet, and R&B inflected "Missing Out G's" which is haunting since Fat Pat is no longer with us. I believe that Big Moe does the singing in the hook. Even though Pat is hella flossy and playa, he is fun to listen to, and I really enjoyed this classic from Houston. The beats are simply outta this world. Beware of one thing; if you have the reprint, the track listing is incorrect. A few joints from his Wreckshop Family: Throwed In The Game are incorrectly listed here. Ripping on the computer will yield the correct titles in order. R.I.P. to a playa took way too young! This cat had heart.

My first E.S.G. album was Sailin' Da South from 1995, a perrenial classic from a Houston underground great. The album, and his 1994 classic, Ocean Of Funk, had sunny G-Funk era vibes to them and were fun From 1995 to 1997, E does time for what I believe to be manslaughter, and returns a different loc. 1998's Return Of The Living Dead is a change of pace for E.S.G. He still has Sean "Solo" Jemison on the boards, along with a new guy JP Nitty, but E goes for a grimier sound for the most part. From the album cover, you can see a gothic overture as opposed to the lowrider on the front covers of Sailin'.. and Ocean.. Now, his third album does not dissapoint either, beatwise or lyrically. He calls out heads who disobey the street code on "Snitch" over a rattling crunk-style beat, and you can hear an interpolation of Too Short's trademark "Beeitch," saying "Sneeitch" instead. Big Hawk RIP, and C-Note join him here. This album often has more of a Crunk influence, or a southern bounce vibe, but there are a few G-Funk songs recalling the magic of his 1st two albums. The awesome and deep "I Know I Should Change" mixes melodic G-Funk with Texas Swang N Bang. He introspects about the trappings of hood life and contemplates flippin' the script. Another joint for chillin' or ridin' is "I Luv N---az" with a soulful relaxed G-Funk beat. This song has as much magic as "Ocean Of Funk" (title track) due to the beat alone. Again, he keeps it real and and is joined by Lil Swift and Immanuel and all drop some street smarts, a banger! Light a spliff to the relaxed keyboard ridden "Lady Indo." E.S.G. drops some knowledge of jail life in "Jail Cell Tales" and is more menacing with E, Devios, and Big T most definitely not glorifying the life locked up. The beat is phat, and appropriate for a angrier, worrysome joint. The title track is where E spits venom. He is a lot more gangsta here over a twisted Zapp "So Ruff, So Tuff" sample. E.S.G. and guest Dark Vador turn heads with the direct lyricism that they are back with a vengeance. "Caught Up" is another hot-headed jam with a bouncy and twangy beat. Doing time definitely got him shook, and it reflects with the angrier tone. He does drop some laidback jams that recall the magic of the first two, but he is hot-headed for the better part of this one. It is his third straight banger, a potential classic, and his next album, 1999's Shinin 'N Grindin prove why E.S.G. was a slept on G that ruled the 90's Texas rap scene, and is one of my favorite MC's of all time.

It is not surprising that Gang Starr has had longevity in this game, since the late 80's to be exact. This has to be one of the best duos of all time because of the chemistry between Premier's beats, and Guru's nasal monotone delivery and sick flow and battle raps work hand in hand; and this album is no exception. Premier's beats have not lost a step; in fact, his beats keep improving. I have most of Gang Starr's albums (all except No More Mr. Nice Guy from '89), and by far, this has to be my favorite album of 2003. Premier still relies on soul samples, yet he elevates them to a level few producers can do. I love the 70's sample in "Skills;" beats like those remind me of the magic of hip-hop from a decade before. Premier and Guru stay true to hip-hop's artistry. Guru keeps his flow intact throughout. He drops knowledge, and stays true to the streets in jams like "Rite Where U Stand" with Jadakiss trading flows over a dope underground style beat. Some of Premier's beats here are stripped down and have simple beat sequences on joints like Nice Girl, Wrong Place" and "Who Got Gunz," but don't take it a s a negative. In fact, it shows the originality and the ability to think outside the box that Primo has. Those beats are different, and they rock! Other beats are full and sophisticated like the title track and the soul-inflected "Deadly Habitz." Where the heck do you find beats and real rhymes these good in 2003 and onwards? All in all, this album is a real underground classic in a time where classics are few and far between.

This is Ten Years After several albums deep still making the magic. A Space In Time 1971 is classic early 70's British rock at its finest. Many people label TYA as a blues-rock band. They do blues-rock style songs, and do them very well, but they are way more than simply that. Their styles are varied, from some songs with a touch of psychedelia, jazz fusion, hard rock, and mellow acoustic rock, sometimes in the same song. TYA is one of my favorite bands, British or American, and Alvin Lee is becoming one of my favorite guitarists. I like Jimi Hendrix, Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple) Eddie Hazel (Fukadelic) Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, and many other guitar-slingers, but I am impressed with Lee's own original arrangements that add layers of guitar sounds and effects. He can go hard as in the bluesy "One Of These Days," one of my favorite cuts here, and he can go acoustic and smooth in "Over The Hill." I love the trippy sound effects and spacy vibe, with acoustic guitar riffs of "Here They Come," which reminds me of an alien invasion of earth. "I'd Love To Change The World" is one of their most popular songs from this album, one of their best known albums. It is a pretty self explanatory song about changing conditions on earth. It is mostly mellow and acoustic, with some rocking riffs here and there. I love the fuzzy, muddled hook vocals. A cool jam it is for sure. One of my favorites here is "Baby Won't You Let Me Rock 'N' Roll You." If one did not know better, a listener may mistaken it for a Chuck Berry cover updated for early 70's hard rock audiences. It is in that rollicking, faster tempo style Berry is know for, yet it is a band original, and a great one (all songs here are band originals; no covers are present). Alvin Lee's voice is extremely versatile, and he channels Berry's style so well. It is easy to see that Berry's influence is big in TYA because TYA did cover very well Berry's "Sweet Little Sixteen" live and the track also appears live on 1970's Watt album. "Let The Sky Fall" has a somewhat country rock feel, and is also cool. "I've Been There Too" is another great jam. It also has its mellow acoustic riffs and harder rocking riffs as well, and the song deals with relating one's experiences with others and moving on in life. "Uncle Jam" is a jazz-rock instrumental which is cool vibin.' This is my first TYA album, and since hearing it, I have purchased many more, from the late 60's to mid 70's, and each album of theirs has a certain magic touch that will stay with the listener. Dare I say that I listen more to TYA than Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, The Beatles, The Stones, and just about every other Brit rock group, and I love all these bands too.

Born in the 80's, I was not around to experience some of the best guitarists, and some of the best rock bands/artists. But, it soes not mean that I cannot appreciate and groove out to them. Robin Trower's 2nd album, 1974's Bridge of Sighs (tracks 1-8)is in your face boogie/blues rock with multi-layer guitar sounds. James Dewar's blues style vocals are a perfect match for the band's diverse sound. I keep hearing that Trower's guitar sounds are heavily derived from Jimi Hendrix. I do hear some Hendrix acid rock influence in several spots, but it is just an influence. I feel that Trower has his own sound that is textual and deep that does take cues from Hendrix's multi-layer sound. Let me say that every (and I emphasize EVERY) single song on this album rocks hard and is awesome. All songs are band originals also. The title track "Bridge Of Sighs" is now one of my favorite rock songs. It starts with a mellow atmospheric sound for 3 seconds, then a whirlwind guitar riff kicks in, and then the signature slower-rolling, yet heavy, blues kick in, and Dewar's vocals take you to the "blues bar" in your mind where people go to process the hard times in life. Some songs are in the slower blues vein like the aforementioned, and the moody, twangy, slightly jazzy and slightly psychedelic "In This Place." There are some heavy, mid-up tempo boogie jams like the funky "Too Rolling Stoned." Dare I say that the first half of the song almost has a slight disco vibe in the tempo but with heavy and twangy giutar riffs(trust me, the funky soulful groove of the song works very well here). Then in the middle of the song, the traditional 12 bar blues riffs kick in for the remainder of the song. "Lady Love" has an upbeat boogie sound and is a great cruisin' song about longing for the missing element of a woman's love. The opener, "Day Of The Eagle," another Trower classic, starts off heavy with some of Trower's signature heavy riffs. The song mellows out towards the end. I love how many of the songs change tempo and style making the listening dynamic. After song 8, there are the bonus jams from around the same time. Another "Bridge of Sighs" version, without the windy 3 second atmosphere at the start, is present. There is also "Alethea," which appears from the band's For Earth Below 1975 album, a uptempo song showing some Hendrix influence but with more of a funk element, an excellent song that should be on Guitar Hero. The other bonus songs are cool as well. I have just started to listen to Robin Trower, Bridge Of Sighs being a starting place for me, and I am hooked. Trower is quickly becoming one of my favorite guitarists for his dynamic skills and his band's incredible chemistry, which is completely evident here on Bridge Of Sighs. I am ordering a few of the Robin Trower band's other albums and am eagerly awaiting them including For Earth Below.

Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire. This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel. The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs. Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments. They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track "Feds in Town" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. "Super Tight..." is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it. Don't sleep on this classic.

A lesser appreciated act from the East Coast, Fu-Schnickens drops its second and last album in late 1994 under Jive Records. The album is a fast, adrenaline paced album full of raw and funky boom-bap beats and often psychotic spits. Rod K.P. Kirkpatrick handles almost half of the production (his beats are real deep-groove, similar to Erick Sermon's beats), K-Cut, Jim Nice, Diamond D, and Lyvio G all handle a song or two each. The beats are real cool and heavy on the bass, so expect your trunk to blow up. "Breakdown" is a joint that got mad play on my native West Coast, as much as many of the better known west coast artists did in fact in 1995. When I originally heard it, I assumed it was a west coast joint because then I never heard of the Fu, and the beat has a Zapp inflected G-Funk feel to it. Anyways, the joint is the perfect party starter with the bouncy beat and fun, fast flows. Chip-Fu is an interesting character. He interpolates cartoon characters (especially Looney Tunes) and has a very different rhyme scheme, yet he still maintains with the beat well. The lyrics are off the beaten path, and can be grimy, but also funny. Joints like "Aaahh Ooohhh!" showcase some on-point flows and battle raps, and Chip's sound effects from his verse and rhymes add a humorous tone to the joints. Another good party starter is "What's Up Doc (Can We Rock)" with Shaquille O'Neal. The beat is pure and raw bass funk. If you like acts like Nice And Smooth and early Lords Of The Underground, you may just like this one. Lords may be grimier, but the vibes, beats, and flows are similar. All in all, an entertaining album, this will satisfy any real hip-hop head who likes furious flow schemes, great funky beats, and high entertainment value.

Too Short definitely has had a great mainstay in hip hop today, and has had one as early as 1993, his 8th album, Get In Where You Fit In. Too Short continues his formula of vocal pimpin on wax, and the sales do not lie, he has sold millions of records with his simple but engaging flows. His flows complement the syrupy G-Funk beats courtesy of Ant Banks (one of my fav's), QDIII(another great), The Dangerous Crew. My favorite Short song of all time is here on "Just Another Day." QDIII laces a smooth twangy funk beat with a great whiny synth in the hooks on this 7 1/2 minute classic. Short does a great job telling his life on tour all across the hoods of the U.S. A similar song is DJ Quik's "Jus Lyke Compton" from his 1992 classic Way 2 Fonky, where he tells the tales of touring all thru the U.S. hoods. I love "Way Too Real" where Short gets it raw and trill over an immaculate Ant Banks lowrider ready beat. "Gotta Get Some Lovin'" is where Short is horny and is sick of not having a woman to fool with over a slick syrupy beat; it's hella funny!! "BJ Betty" is raunchy: I believe it is a remake of an 80's song he made, but don't quote me on that! "All My B----s Are Gone" is self-explanatory with a twangy Ant Banks beat where you'll ride slow loud and bangin' to on the avenue! Pimp rap is not new in 1993 and especially to Short Dog, but his charisma and the G-Funk beats definitely make the album a definitely classic!! Banks and Short ddefinitely have great chemistry and I am glad to say they done made a lotta songs together!

Rappin' 4-Tay comes tight on his second album, 1994's Don't Fight The Feelin.' The production on the album is often raw, in contrast to the smoothness of 1996's Off Parole and onwards. Producers like Black C, J-Mack, JT The Bigga Figga, Fly, Franky J, Anthony, and Cyrus Esteban all draw upon the regional sound of Mobb Music, and twist in some G-Funk, but create a unique beat atmosphere. The beats sound different than many of the beats comin' out the area. Lyrically, 4-Tay has more gangsta and hard core than in Off Parole and onwards, where he is more positive and playa. He does have some jams for the honies, like the twangy, perennial G-Funk classic, "Playaz Club," my favorite. The beat is slower, rolling funk, perfect to ride to. "Sucka Free" is a Frisco anthem over another G-Funk scorcher beat. The beat has a faint whiny riff and some stomp to it, and a menacing hook. Another classic is "The Gift," a more melodic song with a nice whiny synth and again, slow rolling, twangy beat. "Keep One In The Chamba" is a faster paced old-school inflected thumper, a nice lowrider gangsta track with harsh flows by 4-Tay. Fly, a homie of 4-Tay, stops in the hard joint "I Got Cha Back" 4-Tay warns about runnin' up on him. Check his unfadable flow on "I'll Be Around" where he drops some social knowledge about life in the hood over a Spinner's sample. To be honest, this album did take a while to grow on me, especially the beats, because I had gotten Off Parole, 1997's 4 Tha Hard Way, and 1998's Bigga Than Da Game, all which have smoother beats, and mellower upbeat, positive, and playalistic rhymes. But, after listening to this one more and more, I gained to appreciate this one more. He is hungrier and harder here, and the raw beats reflect his style well here. Definitely a mid 90's classic.

E-40's EP is nothing short of a fun listen. 40's complex and varied flow is matched by none. He can be funny and sincere at the same time. Songs like, "Where The Party At," "Ballin Outta Control," and "Ballin Outta Control" (including the remix) are perennial classics with fun, funky, and bouncy beats. If you love Bay area rap, of west coast rap period, all of 40 Water's albums will offer something to entertain you and keep your head noddin!

4-tay comes through with his 5th album, and like all of the ones before, and the 2 after, he always brings the heat. I was blown away by the funky guitar riffs, and the wild west theme beat of "Like a Spliff," the hard, menacing beat and rhymes of "Hatin' Like That," the smoothness of tracks like "Spittin Game." There are also a few party jams like he always has-like "Whatcha Know Bout This" and deeper songs "Ghetto Bluz" (a bonus track). Rappin' 4-Tay's game has not fell off, nor will it ever. He is intelligent, self-aware, cool, and fun, and it shows in this and all his other works! Don't sleep.

Here you have one of my favorite producers in my favorite year for rap: Ant Banks in 1994! His lyrics are decent, but the production is out of this world; it is simply amazing how he flips those p-funk samples, and makes those syrupy, elastic, and almost celestial and galactic space boogie G-Funk beats! Is Banksta a distant relative of George Clinton??? I love the bouncy Zapp influenced "Straight Hustlin" with those interesting keyboard riffs, I can't even began to describe, along with a neat talk box. I love the slower rollin' "Hard As Hell" with a whiny synth in the beginning and first verse! "The Loot" with Too Short is a banger about grindin for paper; Short Dogg kicks in some funny lyrics. Banks gets on now rival Pooh Man in the ultra funky "F-----' Wit Banks;" the flow and lyrics are decent, but once again the beat is stompin' with that 510 funk. "Streets Of Oakland" puts it down for the O with a smooth guitar ridden beat. "Parlayin" kicks in game with sick flows from Banks and his cuddy Goldy. Both kill the mic over a smokin' bouncy beat. Banks is much better known as a producer than a rapper. He can rap, but those beats are better than 99 percent of all beatsmiths out there. He helped create that G-Funk explosion like Quik, Above The Law, and Dre, and spread it north to the bay area.

I hear a lotta heads hatin' on this cat for his skills, or lack thereof. I am an open-minded person and like to give different rappers a chance. I won't lie, Shaq is neither a great rapper, nor a horrible rapper at least here. Since this is my first Shaq album, I have little to judge him by. At times, he goes on too much about his ballin' skills. On a rap album, we'd rather hear other dimensions of his being, but there are times where he shines. 1994's Shaq Fu-Da Return does have a lot going for it and some against it. The pros are the beats, ranging from G-Funk on a few (Warren G's beats are awesome), there is some boom bap and some jazzy east coast funk. The beats are awesome here. Producers include Warren G, Erick sermon, RZA, Chyskillz, The LG Experience and LoRider, Redman (here listed as Reggie Noble). Shaq does get personal on a few joints and does have a nice mic presence on both versions of "Biological Didn't Bother," where he shows how a step-father came in and put Shaq up on game, one version a G-Funk Warren G version with a twangy, guitar ridden beat, and the other with a smooth east coast beat. Shaq is decent on the mic on redman's twisted-fonky beat on "Newark To CI" and flexes his skills with Keith Murray. "Shaq's Got It Made" has a jazzy Erick Sermon beat that rocks. His flow is not bad, but he does get a bit lack-luster with some excess braggadoccio. Shaq does flex more on "Freaky Flow" with Mr. Ruffneck and General Sha. I do not see why people see him as a horrible 1-star rapper. "My Style, My Stelo" features Erick Sermon and Redman, with Sermon producing a deep-groove funky beat. Shaq's raps here are not on par with other joints, as he is way outshined by Redman, and Erick Sermon flows better here too. On "(So U Wanna Be) Hardcore" is where Shaq flows pretty well. He talks about trying to be hard by being a knucklehead growing up. he drops some philosophy here. He says you don't need a strap to be hard. All in all, I feel this album is very good. Great beats, good guests, and Shaq can give us another side of his being here. if it weren't for a few lackluster moments, this album may have gotten a 5 star rating from me.

1994-1995 was an awesome period in hip-hop. Too Short definitely gets his pim strut on real big here. Now, I may not be a big fan of pimp/misogyny rap, and Short is huge on this, but I cannot deny it, he is cool; I have 11 of his albums! He flows easy and simple over the syrupy funk of the beats. Many complain about Too Short's rhyme schemes, but I do like his flow, and he does rhyme well. Now, the beats definitely slap with that 90's G-Funk syrupy vibe courtesy of the Dangerous Crew, Shorty B, Pee Wee, Spearhead X, Short himself, and of course, long time cuddy Ant Banks!! My favorite song here is the Banks and Short collabo, "Can I Get A B---h." The beat is that type you envision ridin' on 3 wheel with triple gold on a famed sunny Cali day! Banks beat here is one of his best ever. Banks also heats up the beat with some old school flava on the pimp style rider anthem, "Top Down." 2Pac, Father Dom, and Flint Mi.'s great MC Breed trade relentless flows over a bouncy Dangerous Crew beat on "We Do This." "Thangs Change" takes a different approach. Spearhead X and Short Dog create a slow bass heavy G-Funk beat while Short analyzes how screwed up life can be and how values in society have changed over the decades trading spits with Malik, Jamal (from Illegal), and the youngsta from Atlanta Baby D. "Paystyle" is hot with a slick rollin' beat and deep bass and Short gets his hustle on makin that cheddar while buckin' down mark azz MC's. I don't like the simplistic sampling on "Giving Up The Funk," for the sample has been overused and sounds so generic here. But for the most part, the beats are bangin' with that mid 90's bay area fonk! Pimp rap was nathan new to Short Dog in 1994/1995, but he always brings that charisma, and why change a winning formula?

E-40 is at his best on this album. He may rap about hustlin, sex, and violence like many of his peers, but the way he does it is inventive. He created much of the slang we use today. This album is laced with hard mobb beats ("Dusted and Disgusted"), melodic G-Funk laden with whiny keyboard riffs("Drank and Smoke"), and even a track with a beat hinting of what we call today "crunk" (1 Luv). He paired these neat beats with with his tongue twisting flow. Most of the songs on the album are classics; the ones that aren't are still tight. Bump this funky materpiece from the yay while sittin' sideways in a lac!

I may be primarily a fan of West Coast rap, but I got to say that I am a big fan of the East Coast's Redman (and also Nas and Biggie). Redman's debut Whut? Thee Album is really tight. He has funky deep bass beats, and an entertaining lyrical style. He is a huge fan of George Clinton's P-Funk, and that is clearly evident as he samples him a lot! He samples cleverly. It may be hard to use the term G-Funk (generally associated with Cali) and East Coast rap in the same sentence, but it has to be done here. It is one of the best East Coast albums ever, and his best, even though his other ones are great too! #10, "Blow Your Mind" is the best one on the album; he even samples Roger on this one!!!! Get it!

1995, New Orleans' Mystikal gets his chance to shine. This album is a far cry from his "Shake Ya A--" joint from 2000 or Tarantula album from 2001 (which I have, and is a fun and funny commercial album); this album is definitely gangsta and has an underground feel to it. Mystikal has a unique and original flow and at times, gives off an angry vibe. I do not know much about his rape charges from a few years ago, and some may let that color their opinions about him (people make mistakes), but that cannot take away from the quality of this album since the two have nathan to do with each other. Beats are simply fantastic southern fried funk and crunk. "Precise" Edwards produces these phat beats. "Y'all Ain't Ready Yet" has a dope N'Awlins jazzy, deep bass beat. He shuts down marks with funny punchlines and has a humorous bragadoccio. "Murderer" is whiny and rattly crunk-meets-G-Funk, and is lyrically menacing. He is angry about his sister, Michele Tyler being killed and wants revenge. The hook is angry with him moaning "Cops murder n----z at night." "Mr. Hood Critic" is melodic G-Funk with Mystikal calling out haters and how he won't let them get him down. The beat is relaxed and sweet, while Mystikal spits hard and fast. Mystikal also goes hard on the crunk inflected "Not That N---a." I like the scratches on "I'M" and the fast adrenaline rush paced beat, another crunk banger. See, the crunk from this period was different than now; now, it is over commercialized, but stuff like this is fun and exciting. I am relatively new to the sub-genre. I used to only look at as club mainstream crap like it often is now (not always though- think new 3-6 or UGK). Mystikal flows over the beats with ease. He can rap fast over the slower beats as effective as he can over the fast ones. This album establishes him as a force in the rap game. I never heard Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous off of No Limit/Jive, but I hear they are good too. This is a must-have classic.

1995, Spice 1 records another classic. Dude ruled the 1990's. He is a gangster rapper with a unique personality and dope killa flow. This album has a neat array of hot headed psycho imagery over neat mobbin' backdrops. The production ranges from Mobb Music (common in the bay in the mid 90's, to psycho funk, old-school sampling, and G-Funk. The producers range from Blackjack, Chase, Clinton "Payback" Sands, Bosko, to the great Ant Banks. The original "1990-Sick (Kill 'Em All)" is a straight gangsta rap with MC Eiht, and Spice's flows are relentless. This joint is representative of the great collaboration power between the 2 homies, and the chemistry is perfect. The beat is melodic Mobb Music with a faint whiny synth. I also love "Dirty Bay" with the twangy, menacing beat. The song samples the whistles from Otis redding's "Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay;" this joint is an awesome grimy bay anthem. "Mind Of A Sick N---a" is crazy good. The beat samples a pattern of Whodini's "Friends;" and the beat has a crazy psycho whiny synth; lyrically, this song is what it is, mainy! "1 800 (Straight From The Pen" has an awesome, more relaxed G-Funk beat, reminiscing on a cuddy in lockdown. Another relaxed G-Funker is "Ain't No Love." This one is a sweet keyboard, and again displays Spice's lyrical wordplay, and he drops some deeper knowledge. One thing, Spice keeps it real throughout this album, and it is why he consistently gets positive reviews. A fun track is "Funky Chickens." The beat is some nice lowrider G-Funk, similar in style to L.A. rap beatwise. He drops some spits about the drug trade. This album has no filler, in my opinion, and is another classic in his extensive catalog. If you from Cali, or like west coast rap, this one is essential.

Comin out of Texas, UGK's third full-length Jive album "Ridin' Dirty" is contradictious, because the rhymes are dirty, but the beats are clean as hell!! The album is bumpin' from start to finish. The production is some of the best I have ever heard from any region, south, north, west, east, whatever. Production is held by Pimp C, 3-2, N.O. Joe, and Sergio. Beats are heavy Southern G-Crunk and deep-fried funk, with some smoother joints. The lyricism is awesome. I love the way these two flow and complement each other. "One Day," produced by 3-2, is a deeper song about the unpredictable ways of life, and how some heads are really trippin' over a gorgeous, faster, twangy Isley sampled beat. "Murder" is a crazy and awesome crunk type joint with heated flows; check the bass on this one. "Hi-Life" is smoother, slow rollin' G-Funk dropping street sociology about the drug trade cycle, a classic! A cool street jam is "That's Why I Carry" over a heavy N.O. Joe (he also raps the hook); this one explains why they stay strapped. "Good Stuff" is a danceable, twangy sex joint. "Pinky Ring" is a dope pimpin' joint with deep twang; just listen to those guitar riffs, a nice joint to roll in the cady with the fuzzy dice hangin' off the mirror! You can hear the DJ Screw influence in "Diamonds And Wood," beat by Pimp C, a slower crunkish joint, an awesome rider anthem for flossin' your whip. 3 In The Mornin' is perfect for the late night cruise; the beat is relaxed G-Funk influenced, but with less melody. This has to be their best album. It just has an awesome vibe to it, and is one of my favorite albums in my collection, and the album is a pinnacle and a standard setter for southern rap! This is my first UGK album, and it solidified me as afan of theirs.

Celly Cel really does his thug thang on this album! He throws in his complex, loud, and often fast flow over tight G-Funk beats. A standout track is "What U N----z Thought." The song is laced with some of the hardest beats and rhymes in gangsta rap. A menacing foreground beat with a Dr Dre'ish whiny keyboard synth in the background. He sounds really angry and crazy on that song. "It's Goin Down" is a lot slower. It has a nice slow jam beat with the occasional faint use of a talk box reciting: "It's goin down" during the hook. Throughout the album, he shows the harder side of California life!

Just as Dr. Dre had been producing and rapping down in the LA area, Ant "The Big Bad Ass" Banks had been doing the same up in the bay. He is an excelent producer and comes up with some of the hottest westcoastin' beats you can find. Of course he produces for bay vets Too $hort, E-40, Spice 1, and too many others to mention. He seems to have the magic touch for music. His third Album "Do or Die," is no exception. It's laced with some of the neatest G-Funk beats ranging from the menacing, hard rollin beats of "Ain't No Thang", and "Hi Speed Anthem" to relaxing and more upbeat "No Time Fa BS." This album is perfect for blasting while rollin with the top down and joy ridin with the homies. Peep game 'n get this west coast classic!

Suga T's "Paper Chasin'" album is a G-Funk classic! She is sassy, sexy, clever, and hard core all rolled into one! She can hustle as well as any men out there. The variable beats on this album are neat; they range from melodic G-Funk ("F-----' Around Wit Suga"), to George Clinton influenced ("If You Don't Want None), and to even a touch of R&B ("Wanna Get Freaky"). This album shows a woman's perspective of how to strive in the game. Don't sleep.

I first heard of B-Legit on 2Pac's "All Eyez On Me" and 40 Water's "In A Major Way," and I am glad I did! B-Legit's 2nd album "The Hemp Museum," is tight. It is straight hard-hittin' g-funk you can bend corners to and lowride to! He keeps it old school on "Neva Bite" (#7)with whiny synths and a faint use of a talk box in the hook. #6, "Hemp Museum" is laid back, funky, and fresh, one to hit switches to, or ride with the top down!! "For So Long" (#3) is also tight with a kickin' beat and use of the whiny synths. Be sure "Check It Out," and cop it!

This is Houston, Tx's great E.S.G.'s 4th album, and let me tell you it definitely is thumpin. I have 3 of his albums, this, 1995's Sailin' Da South, and his perennial classic debut, 1994's Ocean Of Funk. I feel that this can't touch Ocean... or Sailin'..., but it definitely beats the hell outta 90 percent of anything from 1999 and on. Here, he leaves Perrion records and his legendary producer Sean "Solo" Jemison, and enters another legendary label Wreckshop Records, where Fat Pat (RIP) got everybody crunk with Ghetto Dreams in 1998. Fat Pat died in 1998 a year before this came out, and ESG definitely came thru. Produced by Dub D, Sin, Noke D, Chikken Hawk, the album sizzles with southern fried funk and bounce. The production slaps all the way thru with a mix of crunk style and funky beats, and a few beats border on G-Funk. My fav is the bouncy "Who's Next To Plex," an nice mix of lowrider West Coast G-Funk and southern bounce and E gets his floss on. "Shinin' And Grindin'" is a hot bouncy slapper with ESG kickin slick, flossy flows; the song definitely recalls "Swangin' And Bangin'" from a half decade ago. Now this album is flossier than his first ones, so it may have a more mainstream atmosphere than before, but it still bangs because ESG is a great rapper, easily one of my favorite rappers period. Of course, E has the obligatory rider anthem on what else, "Do You Wanna Ride?" with a smooth beat, laidback faint keyboard background, and R&B hook vocals. E does flex his gangsta and grind a bit too on tracks like "Ain't 2 Be F---d With." "Stay Playa" is hella laidback with a smooth, melodic G-Funk style beat with E and some of his wreckshop homies. This album is more for cats wanting a more laidback album to ride to or to bounce to at the club. Definitely a fun album to listen to! 1 Luv to E.S.G. for givin' us another banger to roll to!

Late 1997, Spice 1 delivers us with his 5th album, and his 5th classic in a row. Intact is his awesome wordplay and thuggish ruggish maniacal flow over great beats. This album rates high in his discog. Producers include Ant Banks, Paris, Clint "Payback" Sands, Hen Gee, Ali Malek, Rick Rock, Mike Mosley, and Femi Ojetunde, and the beats are a mix of syrupy and melodic G-Funk and mobb music. Lyrically, he has a neat array of thug joints and a few deeper songs. "The Thug In Me" is a nice dedication to late homie, 2Pac (RIP)over a melodic sample and whiny synth. Spice fires the cheeba on "I'm High" over a heavier, more mobbish beat. Spice 1 calls up WC and Big Syke from LA to kick some game about cali, the bay to LA anthem, 510, 213, named after major bay and LA area codes. Spice 1 flosses a little, but still keeps it hard on "Diamonds." The beat is different, bass heavy, but softer on the foreground beat with a faint whiny synth. "The Boss Mobsta" reminds me of 1995's "Mind Of A Sick N---a," partly because the beat pattern is similar, a Whodini "Friends" Sample, and the lyrics and Spice's flow are crazy like in the 1995 joint. Ant Banks' beats on the banger street joints "Recognize Game" (f/ Too Short, Ice-T), and "Fetty Chico And The Mack" (f/Mack 10) are among the best on the album. "Down Payment On Heaven" is awesome lyrically and musically too! The beat has neat soulful samples to give it a laidback, melodic, and deep feel. Spice 1 contemplates on life, death, and the things he has done, does, and may do. The drama in the hood and senseless killings that take place there are emphasized in a intellectual fashion. "2 Hands And A Razorblade" is another maniacal Spice 1 joint about life in the county jails of Cali. The beat has a whiny riff reminiscent of Snoop Dogg's Murder Was The Case, but the beat is some slick G-Funk that is subtle but with hardcore overtures. There is so much to like about this album. Spice 1 ruled the 1990's, and this classic is a testament to that.

Celly Cel's debut album, Heat 4 Yo Azz is yet another reason why 1994 is one of my favorite years in rap history. Mike Mosely, Sam Bostic, and Studio Ton set Celly up with some sick G-Funk beats that u can only find around this time, many are influenced by the P-Funk music of the 70's like "Funk 4 Life" and "What Am I Supposed To Do." Celly Cel has a sick flow and gives you pure gangsta rhymes throughout. The title track is sick, with the beat sampling the beginning of the One Way classic "Cutie Pie," but instead of becoming fun and relaxing like the original, Mosely and Bostic take it in a sav direction, one of the hardest Sick Wid' It beats with Celly Cel givin you front row seats to gun smoke and robberies. "Hot Sunny Day" is a more laid-back, summer bar-b-q, ridin thru the hood, fun time track with Levitti and Marjuna Mitchell, and "Bailin' Thru My Hood" with B-Legit is a sick rider anthem. Gangsta rap may not have been anything new in 1994, but Celly Cel has an intriguing and entertaining way of givin you the 411 on life in the hood.

Little Bruce's first solo album "XXXtra Manish" is nothing short of slammin'! His rapping style is rough and hard core. Even better, are his beats. Beats like "Mobbin' My Oldschool," "Raw Deal," "Foot Locka Crew," and more are some of the best of any beats from Sick Wid It Records. They are hard hitting, and they are ones you can lowride and hit switches to. They have a touch of old school feel to them. Even though it's hardcore, it's fun to listen to. It's a shame he was not as successful as E-40, B-Legit, Celly Cel, and the others.

1998 C-Bo comes back a year after One Life 2 Live and comes real hard. He is one of the sickest gangsta rappers of all time. He has a wicked flow and a even more wicked subject matter. The production varies quite a bit ranging from One Drop Scott, to JT The Bigga Figga, to Mike Mosely, DJ Darryl, Studio Ton,to BC and Ric Rock. The beats range from Italian Mafia Motifs like on "Major Pain and Mr Bossalinie" (ft/ Spice 1), to smooth G-Funk, to hard core savage like the beat on the title track, a horrorcore, violent classic, one of the hardest beats ever. I love the Bo and E-40 collabo on what else, 40 and C-Bo. "Money By The Ton" is a relaxed G-Funk beat perfect for the hustlers. "Big Gangsta" is also relaxing because of the beat. Bo can spit dangerous venom over such beats, so don't let the laid back vibes of the beats fool you. "Boo Yow!" slaps hella hard with some deep groove G-Funk. C-Bo had classic after classic throughout the 1990's. He hooks up with the best West Coast beatsmiths and spits some heat. C-Bo represents that set-trippin' side of Killa Cali and drops somethin' here for the riders and thugs out in the wild west.

Scarface does something tight here on 1998's My Homies. He does not hog the spotlight; he takes it and showcases some slept on southern, midwestern, and west coast talent. He appears on many; yet he also uis absent from many others. 2 discs and 30 tracks deep, there is room for filler, and there is some, but there are definitely some classic joints here too. The songs are generally hungry hustler and gangster tales that these cats are known for, and that works here. One of my favorites here is on disc 1, "2 Real" with UGK, 3-2 and the R&B voices of FLAJ. This track swangs and bangs with serious deep fried beat and all spittin trill rhymes about survival, keeping yourself grounded, and staying away from the fakers, and staying real, a definite classic. A-G-2-A-Ke kicks in the door from Milwaukee on "What's Goin On" (disc 1), and "Cocaine" (disc 2), with hard core rawness matched by few. If you liked these 2 tracks, check their only album Mil-Ticket, which the latter is featured on, another classic. Menace Clan, from Cali, rocks the block on "Menace N---as Never Die"(disc 2) Devin The Dude brings heat on disc 2 with "Do What You Want," a nice G-Funk track from his 1998 classic debut; he can be earnest and funny at the same time. Face and Seagram (from Oakland, Ca RIP)live cautiosly on "Sleepin In My Nikes" (disc 2)where they live life nervously, ready to shake the spot and mash if it gets deep. B-Legit shows up with K.B. on "Do What You Do" (disc 1). "Win Lose Or Draw" (disc 2) showcases DMG, Face, and Lo-Ke with Johnny P singing the hook, a well-grounded track discussing the ways of life, succeeding, failing, surviving, family, and looking for a better way to live; basically, it is a song about real life. The beat is a georgeous twangy Texas G-Funk smoker. A Couple songs may miss, but those are easily overweighed by the ones I mentioned, and a good or great many more I didn't.

In 2003, too many rappers went pop, with overuse of club and sex anthems with whack bubblegum pop beats. "The Lex Diamond Story" is different. Raekwon has some nice beats, a few even reminiscent of the older school mid 90's New York beats like "Clientele Kidd" and "Pa Blow Escablow". He does not go too pop. He does go "Wyld in Da Club," but doesn't overdo it. While his hard core raps like in "King of Kings," "Clientele Kidd," and others are not groundbreaking because gangsta rap has been around for so long, but he executes the songs well. His music sounds more like rap as opposed to pop! I have to give him mad props for that. If you love pop-rap, this one may not be for you; if you love classic rap, this one is definitely for you.

First off, why am I the only one to have reviewed this gem?!? Houston's Al-D hits hard on his 96,97 joint Mind At Ease. A short EP, it holds its own well. The beats are smokin here, produced by various cats, and generally draw upon a melodic G-Funk atmosphere. He is an intelligent MC and makes it known on "I Understand." This song is one of the best joints to come outta H-Town, and among the best period! Ronald Chandler laces a beautiful laid back, soul inflected, keyboard and twangy guitar driven G-Funk beat perfect for the ride. On this song, D Touches on subjects like people gettin on u while u down, missing fathers, and it is nice to see a rapper show respect for women like D does here! He shows that he understands the hardships of life in the hood and perveys it well and digs in your soul. Al-D, Lil Keke, Shorty Mac and ACT get it crunk and loc'd on "Mind At Ease" over a bouncy DJ Gold beat. "Shady Daze" bangs with gangsta flows by D's homie, Dren. He got nice flows over a space boogie beat. "Roll Models" is an interesting track featuring Lil Mel, a young kid who holds it down well on the mic. He discusses why youngsters lose their roll models to jail and other casualties of life. The beat is nice and laidback. "Y U Hate Me" is where D wonders why people waste their time hatin' n talkin smack. He takes the high road while others diss him as he rakes in the scrill and scales up the ladder, all over a nice smooth keyboard synth driven beat. In sum, this album should be a part of your collection, simply.

Lil Keke bursts in in 1997's Don't Mess Wit Texas with heat and fervor. Along with many guests like Al D, 3-2, and others from the Screwed Up Click, Keke kicks in some trill rhymes over slammin southern fried crunk-funk. He gets socially aware over a sweet laid back beat in "All In The Game." He gets his ride on in the bouncy "Bounce And Turn" over a nice southern fried funk beat. Keke and Big Pokey, along with some other homies get loc'd on "Serious Smoke" over a smooth melodic G-Funk style beat. Keke gets it crunk on "Call It What You Want" puttin' it down for the whole south, and does it again with 3-2 on "Something About The Southside." Keke also has somethin 4 the hustlas on "If You Wanna" where he shows that u can hustle legit by gettin into the rap industry, over a soulful G-Funk beat. I luv the original and screwed versions of "Still Pimpin' The Pen," perfect to lean to! Keke is a very good MC; he can get fun, but can also be serious and has some lyrical depth. Overall, the album slams from start to finish with those sick Southside flows and funkdafied beats.

Early 1997, Houston, Tx's Crime Boss releases his second album on Suave Records, well, now Suave House Records, and the production on this one is better than his first. If you notice a dope, mobbin' west coast G-Funk vibe on a great deal of the album, you ain't trippin'; Oakland Cali's E-A-Ski and CMT produce 60 percent of it, and the rest is by T-Mix, Suave's in house beatsmith, and his beats are equally funky and bangin'. Crime Boss' flow has improved since All In The Game from 1995. Lyrically, this album is hardcore with a lil' bit of hustler mixed in. He warns you that running at the mouth will get you clapped on the whiny synth laden "Please Stop." South Circle's Thorough stops by on the Suave mobb joint "Back To The Streets." The way heads can betray leaves Crime Boss in a state of wary over the lowrider ready E-A-Ski G-Funker "No Friends." T-Mixx laces a laid-back melody-ridden G-Funk beat on "Life Is Crying." The lyricism is serious and somber and held by a female rapper; I believe her name is Slim Goodie, but I am not sure, for there is no credit on the inserts of the guests. The whole album has a serious tone as you can see. The album breaks no new ground, for gangsta rap is nathan new in 97, but this album holds its own with its own grimy lyrics and gloomy funk, and Crime Boss delivers a better album the second time around that his good debut.

The legendary Philly soul group, The Delfonics had been in the game for at least a decade before dropping this 1968 major debut; Thom Bell's production genius, the group's impeccable harmony, and William Hart's beautiful falsetto were all ingredients for a sweet, classic debut, and 6 years straight with hit albums and singles. Albums like this one helped Philly soul bloom in the 70's. "Can You Remember" is one unbelievable jam. The song is a heartbreaker about a boy and a girl growing up together as best friends; the girl grows up and moves on, but the man is still painfully in love with her, and he reminisces vividly about their history. I dare you not to well-up or get goosebumps while listening to this one. When the bridge harmonizes "Baby I Still Love You" leading into the chorus, it gets me everytime. This is what perfect soul is: emotional and deep with great melody. "I'm Sorry" is where a man begs for foregiveness for mistakes made in a relationship. I love the cool concept and wonderful harmony of the title track. The cleverness of lines like "I don't wear a diamond ring;/ I don't even know what song you sing;/all I know is lalalalalalalalala means..I Love You" really make this joint a class act. Speaking of class, this group has soul, and a lotta class. This ain't kiddy pop; this is grown folk music, what real soul is. "Hurt So Bad" and "You're Gone" are sad, but with a more upbeat tempo a la Motown style (like Four Tops, etc), and they are just as wonderful. I like the strings in the chorus of "You're Gone." The Delfonics make some great breakup music that will definitely help you process your emotions after heartbreak. There are some cover songs that the Delfonics brought new life to. "A Lover's Concerto" is upbeat and melody driven, and sweetly romantic, and "The Look Of Love" is a slower mid-tempo Burt Bacharach cover, a "love found" joint. "The Shadow of Your Smile" is a real slow jam cover song (I do not know who did the original) for you and your honey. Next year (1969), they would follow up with the classic The Sound Of Sexy Soul with jams like "Ready Or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide From Love)" and "Somebody Loves You," and 1970's third straight self-titled classic with "Trying To Make a Fool of Me" and "Baby, I Love You." Music like this is timeless. The Defonics are my favorite soul group, shortly followed by The Stylistics (another Thom Bell-produced group full of talent).

AZ's first album: Doe Or Die follows a year after appearing as a guest on the classic Nas debut: Illmatic. Az does a fantastic job on his debut because he is a great lyricist; he keeps his rhymes in great timing with his beats; if the beat is fast, he will rhyme faster, and reverse for slower beats. His beats are variable, ranging from funky, underground, old school New York style on the classic cut "Rather Unique," which has one of the phattest rap beats ever, to gritty and raw on tracks like "Mo Money Mo Murder," and even to beats slightly reminiscent of West Coast G-Funk in the title cut "Doe or Die." Miss Jones kills it in "Sugar Hill" with her sexy hook vocals! Be sure to check this classic mid 90's rap masterpiece!

Breed came hella tight here on his 1994 joint, Funkafied. He is to rap what George Clinton and Bootsy Collins are to P-Funk. Just look at the cover of the album to see! Lyrically, he has a good flow and a dope raspy voice. His topics are not groundbreaking, weed smoke, girls, and the funk, but he is entertaining. If you like Too Short, his homie, you may just like Breed. Beats are very much funky, many are G-Funk at its purest form. Producers include DJ Flash, Brett Ski, Big C, Swift, The Hurra, and MC Breed (Eric Breed) himself. I love the bouncy P-Funk inflected "Back Up In Ya," a perfect house party jam. "Smokin'" is the hooter joint, nice twangy guitar riff and laid back beat. I love the bouncy Zapp sampled "Flava Uv Phony" (f/ Al Breed from DFC) with a sick battle type rhyme scheme and a sick old-school beat which falls in between a West Coast meets East Coast atmosphere. Occasionally, the album approaches a slight East Coast feel on tracks like "Shootin' From The Hip" and "Seven Years," and those beats are dope also. Overall, a dope album from MC Breed. MC Breed should not be slept on because he is entertaining and can tailor his style for heads on the West Coast, The East Coast, Down South and Up North, like where he's from (Flint, Mi).

1994 was a dope year in rap for sure. P.K.O., a lesser known rap group from San Antonio Texas, I believe(even though some say Houston), drops a heated album. These guys put it down for gangsta rap, and this album's definitely hard core. "Nino (Rox II Riches 2)" is horrorcore. The beat is menacing with screams in the background. "San Antonio Ain't S--- Like Compton" is especially angry toned. These guys definitely have heard the 1992 DJ Quik joint, "Jus Lyke Compton" and hated what he said about San Antonio, and they definitely shot back at him hard (I am a heavy DJ Quik fan, though, but I am not offended because beef makes for great rap). The beat is dope G-Funk. In fact, just about the whole album has an awesome G-Funk sound, which in 1994, was prevalent on the west coast, and down south, where these guys are from. One classic joint here is "Gonna Be Alright" which takes some serious looks at social issues. The beat is laidback, soulful, and beautiful, a great G-Funk staple. "Girlz Best Friend" is the pimp joint, not necessary here, but the beat is cool. A nice lowrider joint is "Redrum;" the beat is melodic and twangy funk with some gangster knowledge. "Ni--az In The Hood" reminds me of the Dre and Snoop duet from 1992, "Deep Cover" because it has that hard mobb sound Deep Cover had. "Lick Shot" is another dope track. The beat has a nice P-Funk inflection and a neat woozy synth line. The opener on the album "Shoot 'Em Up" has a neat southern fried crunkdafied beat. If you want hard gangsta lyrics and hella phat beats, this hardly known joint is for you. Real locs recognize real. This album unfortunately, is sadly slept on; I am the first one to review it, and it is 2007, 13 years after it was released.

In the summer of 1993, Vallejo Cali's Mac Mall releases his fully heated debut under underground bay legendary producer Khayree's new Young Black Brotha Records. Let's just say that this cat got flows for years, and he is the epitome of bay area mobb music. Khayree produces some sick and original beats taking on the life of deep groove, twangy mobb style beats and G-Funk. The beat on the intro is hella sick. Serious heads will hear it, and it will remind them of the intro to Dre's The Chronic. I actually like this one better because I like the whiny synth here better than the one on the Chronic. Khayree airs out business and leads into this rare out of print classic. Mac's subject matter may not be groundbreaking: hood livin, drug slangin, and hustlin, but his slick drawl and easy delivery make him fun to listen to. "Don't Wanna See Me" is wicked. The beat is bouncy lowrider funk paired with a sick whiny synth. He easily rips the track to shreds with his maniacal flow. "Sic Wit Tis" again flexes his game over the twangy deep-groove beat. Here, he shakes dudes for their hunnies, so he gives warning to other cats about it. Mac Mall gets a little deeper with "Ghetto There," where tames his aggressive gangsta flows and hopes to spread a message of heads making their lives better, and he discusses the trappings of hood life. The beat is beautiful, smooth, soul inflected G-Funk. Khayree creates some original and different sounds on joints like "Versatile" and the lovably oddball beat on "It's All Good." The obligatory hooter joint, "$$ On The Dank" has an extremely deep bass and a deep-fried guitar twang (few, if any, can do this as good as Khayree). Overall, this album is a phat example of the versatility of bay area and west coast rap. Peep his 1996 classic Untouchable for more of that 707 (Vallejo)gangsta game and mobb ish. Anything Khayree touches, seems to catch fire! Beware, this album is rare. The 2003 re-release goes for up to 30 bucks cuz it's outta print too. I downloaded mines, cuz u ain't gonna find the original 1993 album unless u hella lucky.

Lowriders get juiced to this one. This single came off the Thin Line Between Love And Hate soundtrack, and is the reason why I bought the soundtrack. The song features killa flows from LBC greats Bad Azz, Techniec, Tray Dee, and Nate Dogg, and a nice vocorder from Roger Troutman. The beat is phat. Nice electro G-Funk sampling from Roger's group: Zapp's "Heartbreaker." The song is a prime example of how great West Coast rap was back in 1995 and 1996, funky beats, dope lyricism and talk boxes! Too bad, the LBC Crew did not release a whole LP; I'd guarantee it woulda been a hit.

DJ Quik is easily one of my favorite producers of all time. He should have been given more credit for starting that G-Funk craze in the early 90's as Dre and Above The Law did. Fast forward to 2000, DJ Quik has 4 albums under his belt before him. He produces his own albums and beats, and is consistently great behind the boards. This album is no exception. He still keeps it funky, but updated for the 21st century. The beats are more electronic and deeper in bass, somewhat similar in some ways to 1998's Rhythm-Al-Ism. This album has a lot of hits and bangers on it. I love the first 5. Mausberg (R.I.P) and Quik spit serious game on the fun "Change The Game." "Did Y'all Feel Dat" is the joint. The beat is deep groove bass inflected electro G-Funk with Quik's trademark talkbox, definitely a fun classic to dip to. "Pitch In Ona Party" slaps with that twangy G-Funk sophistication, a top-notch party joint; it got mad radio play in my native Southern Cali in early 2000. In response to a fellow reviewer's comment on the bleeping on "I Don't Wanna Party Wit U," my copy has it too, and I cannot figure out why. The beat is hella phat, and the lyrics are cool, but the bleeping interrupts the flow of the song. "Roger's Groove" is a great tribute to Roger Troutman (R.I.P). Quik does not rap, but uses his talkbox to convey his appreciation for his legacy and the song runs like a Roger song; the beat is awesome and funky, and Quik is awesome on the vocorder. "How Come?" is neat with a typically great beat and a neat drip sound in the background. Quik's flow and lyrics are good, and the hook is tight. Another good party song is the joint "Do Whutcha Want" which has an old-school influenced P-Funk style beat eith Quik trading crunkdafied verses with AMG and Digital Underground. Another fun track is "We Came 2 Play" featuring AMG. This one got radio play out west too. Fun track and a lovably odd funky hook vocal. At first, many of the tracks had to grow on me, but, when they did, I began to really enjoy it. Never should any of Quik's works be slept on.

In 2000, E-40 drops yet another west coast masterpiece, his 6th album (including 1994 EP The Mailman). Once again, E-40 hits you with some great slanguage ("Flamboastin") and has some of the best west coast producers to lace him with cool G-Funk and Mobb Music. The beats on this album are some of the best out the west in 2000. Bosko, Battlecat, Tone Capone, Blaqtoven, DJ Silk, Rick Rock, Jazze Pha, and SMK produce some of the highest quality cuts for E to spit his game over. "Lace Me Up" has that vintage west coast G-Funk updated for the 21st century. He and sister Suga-T lace ya with real game; it seems like a cool sequel to 1995's "Sprinkle Me." "N---a Sh--" features Mack 10, D-Shot, Suga-T, and B-Legit and is a hard lowrider ready mobb joint. The beat simply slaps with that Bosko funk perfect to c-walk or b-walk to. Levitti provides one of his cool, vintage moany hook vocals. A nice gangsta joint is "Like A Jungle" featuring another lowrider Bosko beat, and Bosko's slick vocorder and Kokane's moany hook vocals, a cool mobb joint. "Pop Ya Collar" definitely bangs with some deep-groove, cool-breezy g-funk (cool funk samples). The Click (40 Water, Suga T, B-Legit, D-Shot) deliver a fun, party starting track here. "Flamboastin'" has a bangin' heavy beat and features Baby of Cash Money Records and floss hard, and 40 really busts out his slanguage like crazy here. "Nah Nah..." w/ Nate Dogg's cool hook vocals is a west caost classic. The beat is smooth Battlecat L.A. style G-Funk (one of his best beats ever), which E-40 raps over as good as he does to the bay funk. It is a song dealing with the drama with the opposite sex. This song got so much play in my senior year in high school 1999-2000. E flows real good over southern style beats too! He kills it on "Clown Wit It" f/ Mystikal. Bosko did a great job creating a pulsating southern beat, and the 2's different rap styles fit the beat perfectly. Jazze Pha creates a cool G-Funk smoker on Ya Blind, and he, E-40, Eightball, Too Short school ya about scandalous women. This album definitely has a lot going for it. I feel that this is one of his best albums, and he has had some real classics from the 1990's. I like this one better than the ones that followed, and better than 1999's Charlie Hustle: The Blueprint Of A Self-Made Millionaire, and maybe even more than 1998's double banger The Element If Surprise. Soak up some real game and get laced by E.

Suga Free comes out strong on "Street Gospel." If you love G-Funk and humorous rhymes about hood life and pimpin', this is one to consider. Doe Doe And A Skunk has the best beat on the album. It has a smooth beat with excellent rhyming with a relaxing tropical background beat. Dip Da is a dope track showing Suga Free's more serious side dealing with issues in his family and the hood. It has a really hardcore beat and excellent rhyming. Don't sleep on this album.

Real Brothas is one of those G-Funk albums that typifies what west coast rap is and should be, driving with firey and serious flows, and immaculate production. It is unfortunate, that Real Brothas is their only duo album. For me, there are many standout tracks. Personally, "Whose The 'G'" is my favorite; it brings to the table everything that I love about G-Funk. Produced by Vic C, the beat is amazing, hard mobbin foreground beat, and whiny keyboard riffs background. BG Knocc Out kills it with good old fashioned west coast mad gangster flows. This song is the definition of G-Funk. Most of the other songs are produced by Rhythm D and his beats are awesome throughout. The title track is another banger with a nice whiny synth and bouncy p-funky beat, Knocc and Dresta and kill the track about keepin it treal and straight in the game. Although I am a big fan of Long Beach rap, esp. Daz DPG, Snoop, etc, their constant animosity towards them makes (esp. on "DPG/K") for an entertaining listen. It's neat to hear what words rival rappers have to say to each other (also think DJ Quik and MC Eiht). Lyrically, BG and Dresta have and awesome flow and complement each other well. This album is definitely a classic. Anyone up on that west coast tip needs to have this one.

T.O.A.K. hits us in 1998 with a short but sweet album. The beats for the most part are laid back keyboard ridden G-Funk that rivals some of the best G-Funk beats from the west or third coast, although the sound and the bass of the beats are faint probably due to the equipment. "Gulf Is Coming Up" is an upbeat prelude to what we have realized in the past few years (esp. 2005 and on)that H-Town is on top of its game and has blown up big! "It takesa D.I.M.E." and "Rollin' Kandy" also add to the smooth effect. I love the suave, slower "M.oney O.ver E.verything" and the upbeat melodies of "Robbery." "Circle of Society" is an emotional slick slow rolling joint reminiscing on hard times and keeping ya head up. "Get Down" is an odd but interesting track because Flavor Flav kicks in some flava over an old school Public Enemy inspired beat. The club and original of "Say What" however, depart from the overall smoothness with bouncy, mediocre beats, and "Devil's Backbone" could have been excluded; this song is hardcore, but also departs from the smoothness. If these 3 had been excluded or replaced with more smooth funk, this album would have been a classic, and perhaps among the best of the best.

Coolio's homies, 40 Thevz, finally get a chance to spit some game of their own on Honor Amongst Thevz. The mid 90's had a neat and magical array of beats, for it was known as the G-Funk era. What does this have to do with Honor...? The album came out in 1997, not the mid 90's. Well, the album has the magical, funky feel and sound of rap in 1994 or 1995. The beats are superb, ranging from laid back as in "Let My Mind Be Free," to bass heavy lowrider type beats like in "Mad Doggin." They are lyrically clever and sound like they have a head on their shoulders. Sure, they get playerish and gangsta at times, but it's all good. They have their share of thought provoking tracks like "Crazy Love", "Thank God For The Children," among others. There is not one lame beat on the entire album, a seemingly impossible feat! You need to get up on some game! 40 Thevz packin' flava 4 your ear!

Man, Philadelphia is the city where some real musical magic was made. There are the Delfonics (my favorite), the Stylistics, Blue Magic, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, the Spinners (after Motown) and of course, the O'Jays. 1972's, Backstabbers is definitely a neat album. Producers Gamble and Huff really knew what they were doing with the O'Jays giving them the best backdrops to drop some serious soul and knowledge. Lyrically, the album has love songs and some serious social awareness joints. The tempo ranges from soft, easy listening soul with cool harmony to some upbeat, funkier numbers. "Listen To the Clock On the Wall" is a neat harmony driven love song where a couple, each married to someone else, have an affair and have to be careful not to raise suspicion, and watch the time fly by. The couple obviously has chemistry and they feel that they should be together in the end. I love the tick-tock's in the background. Examining the life of a argumentative relationship takes a serious, conscious turn in the mid-tempo "992 Arguments." I love the horns and harmony in the self-explanatory "Back Stabbers." Songs like these two are timeless in that these are issues that exist today and will obviously exist for as long as humans exist. "Who Am I" analyzes mistakes made in a relationship, a great slow jam. The slower and sweeter "Sunshine" is beautiful. The chorus gives me goosebumps. This is one to play while hangin' with ya boo. It is a sunny, melody driven soul classic. Songs like this are why I dig the Philly soft soul music so much. Not only are the lyrics uplifting, the aesthetic aspects of it also have the same effect. "Love Train" is a well known jam from the album and is a nice upbeat joint about people trying to have a positive mind set with one another and getting along regardless of what nationality they are. "When The World's At Peace" has that classic 70's deep groove funk and deals with issues of war, hate, and peace especially considering that this was out around the time of the Vietnam War. To put it all in perspective, this is simply an amazing album full of passion, chemistry, harmony and of course soul. Today, nobody has even a tenth of the soul these cats had.

Chi Town's own Da Brat created a scene with FunkDaFied in 1994. The album is fully loaded with mid 90's G-Funk jams that ah get your head noddin. Jermaine Dupri's production here is top notch, and Da Brat's lyrical ability is evident. She can flow tight, and even though her lyrics may not be the deepest, she really knows how to get the partay jumpin'. Interestingly, Some of her catch phrases may bring to mind Snoop Doggy Dogg. The title track, and "Fa All Y'all," got mad radio play back in '94 and early '95, but the album has much more to offer. She has sass, and she proves she is as tough as the next male MC, and she can hang. All in all, a dope, if slept on, release.

The Intruders are one of the original groups of the Philly Soul mainstream explosion in the late 60's to mid 70's developing a soft, romantic, and easy-listening style, along with the Delfonics (my favorite group). The Delfonics were working with Thom Bell, while The Intruders worked with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. gamble and Huff gave the intruders some nice slower to mid-tempo grooves to harmonize to. This collective ranges from 1966 to 1974. "Together" (1967)is my choice song here, since I have no actual albums by them since they are so darn hard to find at a reasonable cost. "Together" has a nice mid-tempo beat with some fantastic horns and some outstanding harmonizing in the hook. It is one romantic song with clever lyrics (some about being lost together on an island and not even noticing it because the couple is so intensely in love). The lead crooner, Sam "Little Sonny" Brown has a unique tenor voice that fits the mold of the songs perfectly, especially in "Cowboys To Girls" (1968). I love the comparison of love to a sport, not to mention the awesome vocal arrangements and harmony of "(Love Is Like a)Baseball Game," (1968) Gamble and Huff even interpolate part of the "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" composition and blend it with their own original composition of the beats. "Slow Drag" (1968) is simple marvelous. The man in (possibly Brown himself?) moves to his own beat while trying to romance women, even though some people shun him for not being hip to their standards. As for the 1970's songs, "Teardrops" (1973) is a sad but romantic heart pouring slow jam. "I'll Always Love My Mama" (1973)is a sweet uptempo jam about being raised up with a wonderful mother, and all that she endured trying to make a good life for her son. "I Wanna Know Your Name" (1973) is a great soundtrack for a guy who has a crush on an anonymous lady he dearly wants to know. The guy portrayed in the song tells a little about himself (interests and tastes) and how he wants to dance with the cutie. The harmony in the chorus is unbelievably breathtaking. On a lighter not, I swear that these guys could sing about dog dookie and still sound great. All I can say, as a 26 year old who loves and is still learning about these great soul groups, is that these guys are immaculately talented, and this collection seriously aroused my interest in getting a hold of more of the intruders music because they really represent every facet of what is classic RnB.

Scarface is one of those rappers that helped define an era of gangsta rap. He is a huge part of the Rap-A-Lot legacy. The World Is Yours from 1993, is one of the hardest albums from this legendary label. The beats slap with that southern hard core melodic early 90's G-Funk inspired horrorcore from the likes of N.O. Joe, James Smith, John Bido, and Scarface himself, with Mike Dean adding some additional mixing. Scarface's raps are laced with relentless mainy flows showing that the 5th Ward ain't nathan to mess wit. "Lettin' Em Know," "Comin' Agg," "Dying With Your Boots On," "He's Dead" among many others need no description, for the title tells all, simply put, angry gangbangin' over bass heavy slap. "Now I Feel Ya" is different though, a nice laidback softer G-Funk beat giving homage to those who helped him come up in life and who gave him game to realize where he was heading in life and to change it for the better. "Funky Lil Aggin" is o.k.; it showcases a youngster named 2 Low who would release his only solo joint Funky Lil Brotha later that year (1993); the beat is funky and twangy, and 2 Low's flow is good and hardcore. One of my favorites is "You Don't Hear Me Doe." The beat is melodic in the vein of early Compton's Most Wanted, but of course with a tangy southern lowrider G-Funk style beat. The beat is awesome, and Face spits fire like a tech, makin it known he ain't playin.' Overall, a bangin' classic that took Scarface and Rap-A-Lot to a whole nother level. Houston is home to Face, and many of my favorite rappers of all time; albums like this cement such sentiments!

Devin's 1998 debut is filled with such an entertainment value ranging from the beats to the lyrical content. The beats on most of the songs are awesome. Generally, they are laid back Texas deep G-Funk with a nice bass to them. He can flow tight and his delivery is funny and clever. The way he dsescribes his sexcapades, his obsession with dank, and even him boo boo'n will get you crackin' up throughout the album! Devin also has some deeper tracks about life and making choices in songs like "Alright," and "Do What You Wanna Do," and how people can be so scrutinizing and critical in "Write And Wrong." The guitar riffs on "One Day At A Time" "Alright" "Write And Wrong" and half of the other tracks are hella funky, so the album will also get you into a relaxed mood. Anyone into Old School Dirty South rap, West Coast rap, or G-Funk will have instant satisfaction with The Dude, but anyone into good, keep-it-real, witty rap, will dig this underground classic as well!

Mic Geronimo, straight out of Queens comes out in 1995 with a debut full of awesome beats courtesy of Buckwild, Mark Sparks, Chyskills, Beatminerz, DJ Irv (I believe this is Irv Gotti, the one with Murder Inc and Ja Rule.). The beats are some smooth, bass heavy boom bap, often paired with rich keyboard melody. On the mic, Geronimo, no pun intended, is simply sick with his grimy flow. If you love street oriented gangsta rap, this is for you. You even get a hungry and agressive Ja Rule, DMX, and Jay-Z featured on this album all together with Mic on "Time To Build" over a sparse, menacing DJ Irv beat. Ja, Hova, and DMX all sound so different then how they sound today, underground and mad angry, and they all shine. Mic flexes his skills on the title track over a heavy drum beat and sick scratching and relaxing background keyboard melody. OC and Royal Flush come and kick mad flows on the space boogie beat of "Men V Many." They all kick some sick philosophy. "Sh--'s Real" is thumpin' with a sunnier vibe beatwise with a twangy, soulful sample; yet, he does kick gritty lines here too. Overall, this album bangs with great production and underground street rhymes. A definite Queens classic along the likes of Mobb Deep and Nas, and LL Cool J's more street-oriented ish; this is essential material for real rap heads regardless of where u from, and I am mainly a Southern and West Coast G-Funk head.

Houston, Tx's Crime Boss' First album All In The Game came out in early 1995, by Suave Records, a quality record company in Texas with good rappers and phat production and beats. Eightball and MJG from Memphis were signed, so you understand why I say that. All In The Game is full from start to finish with that deep-fried, twangy southern Suave FONK! T-Mixx is a great producer!! The beats are great, and Crime Boss, an o.k. lyricist, has help from the Suave greats Eightball and MJG, and fellow labelmates South Circle. Lyrically, this is a typical gangsta album with hard lyrics, edged off with some fun '94-'95 style G-Funk tracks. A couple of the hooks are weak, though, on the album, but overall, the album is tight. My favorite jam is the laidback G-Funk jam "Big Chiefing," a perfect, sunny track to roll to with a nice melodic beat; there is a 2 minute RnB intro about loc'n up a sack of yay, and then the rapping starts. It is hella relaxing and fun to blare in the atereo. "Story Goes" is more of a crunk-inspired track with 8ball and MJG and CB trading killa verses. Another harder track is "Recognize," which is highly inspired by the G-Funk craze of the 90's. The beat seems to sample "Aqua Boogie," and employs a dope whiny synth in the hook. The hook vocals seem to interpolate the sampled song. I am not crazy about the hook vocals cuz they sound so generic, but to me that is a very minor issue cuz the beat is hella tight. Another hook I do not like is on "Put 'Em Up" which interpolates a P-Funk sample and again sounds generic and lame. The beat of the song, though, is once again, hot and funky. Another Mobb sounding track is "Going Off" featuring South Circle with a slappin hard mob style beat with twangy guitar riffs. One thing you'll notice is that 8ball and MJG are featured a lot here, perhaps a marketing ploy due to the duo being popular in the south at the time. I like them a lot so it is no issue to me! "Dreaming" is a neat woozy track with some high pitched, piercing synths. The beat is whiny and multi-layered and CB has a nice flow here. Overall, All In The Game is a dope effort with great beats. Crime Boss is not a great lyricist, but with the help of Ball n G, he drops a dope mid 90's album under one of the phattest label groups from the south.

MC Ren comes back for his fourth album just 2 years after The Villain In Black. Unfortunately, this is the only album of his I have as of Mar. 2007. But I gotta say it knocks all the way thru. Ren still kicks those tales of his Compton set just like he did with NWA. Even though he reps CPT to the fullest, the beats are just as Bay Area, and even Down South, as they are LA. Ant Banks laces fire on "N---a Called Ren," and "All The Same" with those melodic space boogie beats he's well known for. T-Mixx, of Suave House fame in Texas and Memphis creates heat on 3 songs (1/4 the album!): 1)"Who In The F---" (f/ 8Ball/MJG), 2)"Voyage To Compton"(what an awesome laid-back G-Funk smoker), and 3) "Must Be High." All Three slap with that down south funk flava. LT Hutton, Young Tre, Tha Chill,and a few others lace up some L.A. Flava on the remainder of the album. The beats are G-Funk with a syrupy taste. The production for the most part is awesome, even though I am not crazy about the beat on "So Whatcha Want." Ren still kills all the tracks with that gangsta flow. Definitely worth the scrill.

Hav and Prod's 2nd album is nothing short of smokin'. Prodeje produces some of the banginest G-Funk beats to ever come out the west coast! Many of the beats are relaxing, so you know this one is for the rider in you. The SCC group album N Gatz we Truss was a dope album, but the producion was more polished and smoother on this one. Robert "Fonksta" Bacon jr. throws in those awesome guitar riffs like he does in SCC's albums and in Quik's works and gives the album a great vibe. Plus, Hav and prod tear up the mic. Who says that West Coast MC's can't rhyme? LV lays down some dope hooks. This album was well put together, adn it will show throughout. If you like this album, you'll definitely need to peep SCC's All Day Everyday; there is a similar vibe in that album. This album is a classic!

This is the first album I ever got. I got it in Junior High School from a friend on cassette tape and back then I was a very casual rap fan unlike now, but I have to say I loved it. I now have the 2001 re-release with 13 tracks. Every song is a winner and definitely helped propel the rap industry into the G-Funk Era in 1993 and 1994. Snoop's drawl definitely complements Dr. Dre's awesome melodic funk. I like this one better than the Chronic, and that one bangs too! One of my favorite jams here is "For All My N----z And B---es" where Tha Dogg Pound and Lady of Rage kills the track with relentless gangbanger flows over a bass heavy mobbin beat and loud whiny synths Dr. Dre popularized in the early to mid 90's. "G'z And Hustlaz" is interesting, for the beat brings in elements of rock n roll guitars and Snoop kills the track. He has one of the best flows in the game on this album. I really can't say much more that what has been already said. "Serial Killa" again brings in that whiny synth and Tha Pound and RBX bring so much heat to the table; all 3 kick such mainy flows right out the mental ward, what a classic. "Gin And Juice," "Doggy Dogg World" are what they are, classic G-Funk that stand the test of time; songs like those were repeatedly looked to for influence on other West Coast and even some southern albums in the mid 90's era. "What's My Name" definitely is bouncy, anthemic, and catchy over a P-Funk type sample, another G-Funk stable. If only rap was as passionate as Snoop, Dre and his guests were in this day of age. Timeless classic is the best way to sum up Doggystyle.

Late 1994, a hardly known duo, Detriot's Gank Move deliver a sick, trill gangster rap album that is so hardly spoken of, it sickens me. The lyrics aren't groundbreaking, but it is a dope gangsta rap album with very good beats. Gank Move handles the whole production which draws upon sparse drums and G-Funk melody. "Real N---az & O.G.'s" is a laidback G-Funk classic with slick whiny keyboards perfect for the sunny top-down ride. This joint may remind some of Warren G's melody but with a sparse beat pattern. The video version is "Real Playaz & O.G.'s," and the video is cool; check for it on You Tube. "Trigga Man," like most of the rest has a more gangsta mentality. The beat has a neat bump to it. "Be Alright" has a similar vibe to "Real N---az & O.G.'s." "Hustlers" has another sunny beat to it and a slick whiny synth, and they drop some no holds barred street philosophy and dope flows. They get heated in "F--- You" and drop some warnings to the haters. The beat is an old funk sample and has a more menacing vibe than the sunny G-Funk on the others. They even have a "dedication" for the dopefiends in the directly titled "For The Fiends." The beat is twangy and sick, and they again drop some gritty imagery. If you like harsh midwestern rap, and good G-Funk beats, this album will not dissapoint. Fans of Dayton Family and similar acts will definitely dig this one.

3X Krazy's 1995 EP, Sick-O, is a dope under the radar release, with a few surefire classics. The high-speed anthem "Hit The Gas" is a G-Funk smoker with a bangin' beat and a menacing whiny keyboard riff through the song. "Sunshine In The 'O'" is an awesome, laid back G-Funk song perfect for ridin', slippin,' and slidin' down the Cali streets. Then we have "In The Town" a dope gangsta rap track with another smoldering beat. Bart, Agerman, and Keek Tha Sneak have awesome chemistry and all bring phat rhyming skills and unique personalities to the table. If you like this one, you'll surely like 1997's Stackin Chips even more.

Bad Azz brings heat to the table in 1998 on his solo debut. The beats are variable on this album, ranging from G-Funk you can lowride to, to some old-fashioned rap and hip hop beats. Ant Banks produces 2 of the hottest tracks on here "Ghetto star" and "I Ain't Concerned." "We Be Puttin It Down" is a fun bouncy collabo between Bad azz and Snoop over a G-Funk beat and a talk box I think that says "roll, roll, roll." Bad Azz does get contemplative in the phat track, "My People." The track "Livin It Up" is hot also; the foreground beat is bouncy and fast paced, and the keyboard driven background beat reminds the listener of old school G-Funk, perfect to play at a party. The beat at the very beginning of "My People" (before it changes to the actual beat of the song)should have been used as a beat on another song; it is the best beat on the album.

4 Years after Maad Circle dropped the classic 1991 joint Ain't A D--n Thang Changed, an album that is way outta print and something I have the misfortune of not owning, WC and Crazy Tunes drop another classic, 1995's Curb Servin.' Full of Parliament and other funk samples, the beats are the truest forms of G-Funk. Many of the samples are flipped into beats sounding as if they had come out in the 70's and 80's like the originals! So the album has an old school feel even for 1995. WC is the primary force behind the mic, and Crazy Tunes handles most of the production along with a little help from Ice Cube, Madness 4 Real, Dr. Jam, and Rhythm D (his joint is awesome). WC kills each track with top-notch flows and his humorous delivery. He, Mack 10, and Cube represent for the left coast on the perennial classic "West Up!" over a George Duke "Reach For It" sample. "The Creator" is awesome, Rhythm D laces a sweet laidback beat and Maad Circle gives it up for the Man Upstairs. "Taking Ova" is a bouncy faster lowrider track. "Put On Tha Set" is hilarious. The beat is bangin' and the lyrics explore Dub's entrapment in a television set; the way he objectifies Hillary from Fresh Prince will leave you on the floor bustin up!!! "Curb Servin'" is hot. It is a perfect rider anthem over a Tom Tom Club "Genuis Of Love" sample, amped up for the Cutlass or drop top 6 Fo. "Wet Dream" has a nice laidback funky beat, but the lyrics are enjoyably odd. He talks about his thang rising and busting during a dream about brothas banding together and dropping their gang problems and getting violent revenge on politicians and people who oppressed brothas. Interesting way to flip heated political lyrics. "Feel Me" is perfect to get your boogie on with a melodic, a nice house party jam. This album is interesting with nice funk to blast in the ride.

I am maninly a rap fanatic, and I am mad young, and I ain't gone front, I know litle about this great soul group, but I will say this, this collective has some great 70's soul jams with great vocals and sweet hooks and smooth jams. Fans of Delfonics and similar groups who have not yet checked the Stylistics out should. Russel Thompkins Jr.'s mountain high falsetto is cool. "You Are Everything" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. I love how songs like this build up to a musical and vocal climax from the beginning of each verse to the wonderfully harmonic choruses. I love the simple lyrics of the song, and how deep the emotions are behind them. It is such a beautiful song. This jam along with "You Make Me Feel Brand New (my close 2nd fav here) really captivate the soul. I would like to experience the emotions the singers and writers had while creating these classics. "People Make The World Go Round" is a cool jam dealing with social issues in society. "Break Up To Make Up" is a little sadder and slower and as emotionally rich as any other here. It analyzes a rocky relationship with sweet yet somber vocals. I would have loved to grow up in a musical era with such rich songs. I love the airy chorus of "Betcha By Golly Wow" and "Stone In Love With You" and the breezy, sweet vibes they give off. "You're A Big Girl Now" is a bit upbeat and funky adressing a love interest coming of age. For some reason to me, this joint sounds cool for lowriding. If you like slower soul jams with breathtaking heavenly vocals and instruments, then this Stylistics collective has all the cool slow jams to evoke those feelings for ya boo. These songs all have a magical feel to them and define real soul music. Anyone going retro like me and exploring older soul should start with groups like The Stylistics.

D.B.A. Flip is a rather unknown rapper from Inglewood, California, and his album Flip On This is rather unknown; it came out in 1996, and it is now 2007, and I am the first to review it. The album does not break any new ground lyrically, but it is fun to bump all the way through with very good production. He handles much of it along with some various co-producers. For the most part, it has that bouncy late '96 G-Funk to open up the late 90's underground West Coast G-Funk explosion, for the mid 90's were the years where G-Funk was much more mainstream. I love the "Just Got Paid" sample on "It's Friday Night (Just Got Paid);" the beat is twangy and laidback with a dope vocorder in the hook. "Pass The joint" is the hooter track a nice relaxer again with a talk box. The vocorder comes in a good few of the tracks, and I am a huge fan of it. "It Ain't Nothing Nice" is a dope one with Ras Kass and Flip kickin some gangsta rhymes; both flow great over a nice underground beat. "The Vapors" has a beat similar, but not as melodic as Snoop's "Gin And Juice;" it's decent, but not groundbreaking. "Stay True Damu" is where Flip is pretty hot; it's a bouncy G-Funk scorcher cautioning the youth about the trappings and temptations of fast money and crime; he has a decent, if humorous story in the last verse. He flows good over the beat and gets his point across. There is some filler like "I Got Money," but even tracks like that ain't all that bad. It still holds its own; though, it may take a little time for some to grow on you. Overall, a tight album from D.B.A. Flip. Get it for the ride or the party.

Philly soul legends, The Stylistics get their sophomore album out in 1972, a magnificent follow up to their classic 1971 debut. Once again, the harmony is perfect, and Russel Thompkins Jr.'s high falsetto reaches deep into your soul. There are songs here that made me wish I was alive in the 1970's (I was born in the early 80's) to appreciate this masterpiece. "Peek-A-Bo" is an all around fun flirty classic with unreal vocals. The beat is smooth, melodic, and funky and always puts me in a good mood, no matter how angry or stressed out I am. Play it when you're in a horrible mood, and I dare you not to break a smile. It is so uplifting. "If You Don't Watch Out" has another upbeat feel to it, but it deals with the issues of re-falling in love with a complicated relationship. I love the lush, exotic beat and the airy vocals of "You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)" where Thompkins Jr. pleads with a woman not to hurt him by alluding to the angels watching her every move, an interesting concept, and a beautiful song. "You're As Right As Rain" is a mellow joint. The choral backing is mad heavenly adds to the airiness of this beautiful song. The lyrics deal with issues about opening up to a woman, and how some women really make us men fall for them and their sweet personalities. I love the twanginess of the 7 minute slow jammer "Children Of The Night." It's sad how Russel sings about wandering lonely out at night lost looking for some company. Another classic here is "I'm Stone In Love With You" where he dreams up some schematics to please his love interest, a house on the moon, a big business so he can buy his heart anything she wishes, a sweet jam with fantastic choral chants in the hook. To sum it up simply, this is a masterpiece of the real soul era. This album will reach your soul, and you will get goosebumps when Russel hits the high notes. This one gets regular rotation, along with their first one, along with The Delfonics and Blue Magic when I'm ridin' or chillin.'

Houston heavy hitter Scarface comes out with another winner in 2002 with The Fix, which is a refreshing album considering they over-commercialized stuff out in 2002. In addition, the production is a breath of fresh air, especially considering the monotony of club beats that were prevalent that year. The beats are definitely in tune with the times, but there is a lot of soul in them. The sound varies a bit on some, ranging from bass-loaded boom-bap to R&B style beats and a couple of G-Funk type beats. Kanye West has some seriously ill beats here, and other producers here include Nashiem Myrick, Nottz, Mike Dean (on the mixing tip), T-Mix (Suave House), The Neptunes and a couple others. "On My Block" and "Guess Who's Back" (with Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel) are a little more mainstream saavy, with Nashiem and Kanye respectively behind the boards dropping some bangin' melodic beats reminiscent of boom bap, which Face sounds great over (He sounds good over many styles of beats, East Coast style boom bap included.). The Neptunes create a sweltering hot sunny groove in the RnB tinged "Someday" with some relaxing keyboards and synths. Faith Evans drops a sweet hook and Face discusses life philosophies and God, a beautiful track with one of the best beats on the album. Right after that one is the dope lowrider ready g-funk jam "Sellout," featuring a bouncy T-Mix beat which has somewhat of a West Coast vibe with the faint haunting synths well in the background, and the lyrics, which are a little harder edged, are about calling out fake people. Face keeps it real on the nice soul-g-funk type jam "Safe" (produced by China Black). Kanye West produces one real hot beat on the hard edged gangstafied "In Cold Blood," which has a nice soul inflected, rolling funky beat. Nas and Kelly Price joins Face in the bouncy g-funk infused "In Between Us." The Westside Rider WC kichks it with Face on "I Ain't The One" over a slower-paced southern style beat, and the two have good chemistry together. The beat is hot, but with WC on the mic, a bouncier beat would have done a little better. Scarface ranks high on my list of favorite rappers; he may not flow like Rakim or Guru, but without a doubt, he definitely does hold his own and does have a commanding Mic presence, and a hella dope raspy rap voice too. The Fix is definitely a highlight of 2002, and a great album to bump all the way through. He connects with rappers from all regions (Nas, Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel: East Coast; WC: West Coast; Kanye West: Midwest, Neptunes (Virginia Beach), Mike Dean, T-Mix: South) and so forth. It shows that he is not limited by the region from which he hails, the south; he branches out and drops a dope, well-rounded album of various sounds and atmospheres.

1993 and 1994, ESG records an album that goes under the national radar, but definitely laid it down for the local Houston rap scene, and helped in large part influence that swang and bang mentality we know of today. 1994's Ocean Of Funk is an outstanding album from start to finish. Sean "Solo" Jemison has so much funk in his blood; he burns the tracks with sweet, soul and P-Funk samples and flips them into melodic G-Funk style beats that will get you addicted. Some sound quality may be low, but just turn the beat up, and the bass will kick in! ESG's mic skills are untouchable; just peep his flow on "Ocean Of Funk." His drawl definitely fits the beats well. Now if you have this along with his 1995 classic Sailin' Da South, you will notice that some of the tracks are similar or the same. "Crooked Streets" is the same on both, lyrically and beatwise. "RIP" from Sailin'.. has the same lyrics as "Anticipation," but the beats are both different, and awesome. But, both "Swangin' and Bangin's" have different beats and many lyrical differences. Both are absolutely excellent. The parallels between the two albums SHOULD NOT be a reason to only buy one or another. The rest of the tracks on both are marvelous. "Flipping" is a bouncy, lowrider classic over an Al Green sample. "My Real N----z" is slick using the same beat DJ Quik used in 1991's "Dedication" from his Quik Is The Name Album, only with a whiny keyboard and sick flows. The South is a 3rd coast anthem over a Parliament "Aqua Boogie" sample, so it will have a slight West Coast feel to it. The title track uses a Whodini beat pattern with keyboard melodies. It gives me goosebumps; the beat is immaculate. ESG says to "Close your eyes and open your trunk and sink into the ocean of this G-Funk" to open up this banger, one of my favorite lines in rap! This album is hella rare now, it may go for $40-60 in some places. But I highly reccomend this one. If yopu can definitely get Sailin' Da South as well. This cat is one awesome MC and "Solo" is one of the best producers out there. Don't let those 4 similar tracks between Ocean and Sailin' deter you. Both are worth every penny!

Paris is a hard-edged political rapper from Frisco, Cali. This album is my intro to his work, and I hear his albums before this are even better. This album is a 2003 rerelease of his 1994 banger, Guerilla Funk, with the last 4 joints being songs from his 1998 Unleashed. Dude can rap and produces hella sick beats! He includes some sick social commentary and pulls wack MC's hoe cards. Anyone digging the likes of Kam, Ice Cube, Above The Law (Uncle Sam's Curse), Willie D, and E-A-Ski will definitely like this one. It is socially aware with a tough street flair. The title track is some smoked out George Clinton influenced bounce and is perfect for a house party, and he flows real tight here. This whole album, and the Unleashed songs here are awesome examples of Cali's G-Funk explosion. "It's Real" is hard edged and social and pro-black over a lowrider ready beat reminiscent of the beats E-A-Ski is known for, deep-groove mobbin' funk. Serious Hip Hop heads may recognize the sample on "Outta My Life." It is the same sample used on Nas and AZ's "Life's A Bit--," and Coop MC's "My Woman" from Master P's Down South Hustlers comp. Paris' own is sick. He drops some serious life and street philosophy. "Back In The Days" reminisces growing up when heads fought by hand and not by guns. He remembers the house parties. He also reminisces on political and social life back then too. The beat is chill and melodic. I love the sunny G-Funk with airy whiny synths on "Whatcha See?" Conscious Daughters come by and spit some street game on the southern bounce influenced "Bring It To Ya" with a piercing whiny synth in the hook. Paris also gets gruff and gangsta here and knocks America for its treatment of blacks. This album is phat all the way thru with that street knowledge game and bangin G-Funk beats. The last four joints here are from 1998's Unleashed are phat and still have that political and street fire Paris is known for. "Street Soldier" is heated G-Funk perfect for the lowrider. He's mad gangsta here. He keeps kickin social philosophy on the plight of blacks on the sunny chill G-Funk "Root Of All Evil." If you can, get the original Guerilla Funk and then check out Unleashed. I do not have Unleashed, but it sounds like it would be dope.

Blue Magic, yet another great Philly soul group, releases its 1974 debut. As a fan of The Delfonics and The Stylistics, 2 other Philly legendary groups, I finally heard of these guys and definitely dig them. They have style and class, and the harmony is wonderful. Teddy Mills can really hit some high notes with his falsetto. The joint "Spell" is fantastic. I love the sitars (an early to mid-70's trademark), airy beat and heavenly chorus. A woman's charm and style puts a "spell" on these guys and changes their lives for the better. Mills gives me goose bumps when he belts out "I'm lovin' ya power, baby,... aah....spell" in a mountain high tenor. "Sideshow" is clever and sad. The sadness of a broken heart is a spectator event and a window into a sad person's heart. Once again, the vocals are heavenly. We get an upbeat disco-like jam, "Look Me Up" which is fun and funky with some of Mills' best vocal flexing. "I Just Don't Want To Be Lonely" is self-explanatory, a great mid-tempo jam with a funky, rolling beat. We then get another upbeat, funky joint, "The Answer To My Prayer" where Mills declares that a certain lovely woman is "the answer to [his] prayer." "Stop To Start" is a song dealing with slowing down a tumultuous relationship so as to start over again on the right foot, a beautiful jam once again. Remember, this came out in an era where many more albums, like this one, were skip-proof. Every song here is a certified winner. If we could only return to an era where music had the real magic groups like these had. At least we can go and pull albums like these out.

There are many cd compilations of oldies artists' materials out there, but many of their actual LP's are hard pressed to see the digital CD reissue. Perhaps the reason is that the music industry was more singles-driven. This re-issue for a while was fetching up to 200 bucks, and as I am persistent on checking the prices of albums on which I have my eyes, after a year or two, I caught a break, and a seller was selling it for 20 bucks, and voila, a huge smile on my face! I am an 80's child, so I was not around when these songs and albums were released initially. I love the Moments, for their harmony is sweet. I already have cd re-issues of other Stang Records albums like A Moment with the Moments (1970) (paired with their lounge standards The Other Side of the Moments from 1971), and 1972's My Thing (oddly paired as well with Other Side...) (still worth every cent to me!). Those albums have the lineup of Ray, Goodman and Brown. Not on the Outside was before Harry Ray's involvement with the group, and Mark Greene was a vocalist here on Not On The Outside 1969 album. The album goes back to the Moment's first hit single, 1968's "Not On The Outside," a mid-tempo number. This is not the only classic jam here. The group relies less on cover material, and mroe on originals, often written by Sylvia Robinson, and with some lyrical help from the group itself. Here, we have the original Moments' version of "Love On A Two-Way Street" from 1968-69. Lezslie Valentine, another Stang Records artist did the first version in 1968, and her version is truly heartfelt and emotionally purging, but her version did not chart to the best of my knowledge. The Moments picked it up, and even it took a while before they gained fame from it as a smash: it took until early 1970, and the song was re-released on A Moment With the Moments album also in 1970. The song is truly one of my favorite songs of all time, and it rings with soft, sweet neo-doo-wop harmony. Another favorite from Not On... is the slow drag winner "Somebody Loves You Baby," a song with a sweet, string laden arrangement foreshadowing the soft harmony soul that would prevail in the early 70's. There are some phat uptempo grooves here as well, such as the groovy "Hurts On Me Baby," slightly reminiscent of a Motown recording of the late 60's. "Pocketful of Heartbreak" is yet another slower heartfelt jam, based on doo-wop harmony. I really love the slower jams, and there are plenty here. Now, 1970's On Top is another winner for sure. Again, there is very little, if any, cover material to the best of my knowledge, for Robinson, and even the Moments again writing the material. "Lucky Me" is a sweet winner with an upbeat, positive tone. "To You With Love" is a vintage, slow drag Moments ballad with poetic lyrics and sweet strings. "Candy Shack" is yet another slow drag ballad with exceptional harmony again drawing on the doo-wop and call and response of a decade earlier as a basis for the lyrical delivery. Both albums Not On The Outside and On Top are equally wonderful albums, and are worth each cent of purchase. A Mark Greene solo recording: "My Confession of Love" also appears, which is a bluesy sweet number. It is a shame this re-issue is so rare and out of print, for it is truly a remarkable find for Soul and RnB fanatics.

1998, Ruthless Records releases a comp of older fav's from its artists. The songs are tight, many are bonafied classics, but the selection is a bit lacking in my opinion. We Get MC Ren classics from 1993's Shock Of The Hour like "F--k What Ya Heard," a couple of H.W.A. joints from their 1994 album Az Much A-- Az U Want like "Great Tazte Less Fillaz," a real horny song with a dope G-Funk beat. You get JJ Fad's pump-u-up joint from the late 80's "Supersonic." You also get a couple N.W.A. joints of course, and definitely a few Eazy-E cuts. You also get 2 "new" Eazy-E cuts (old Eazy spits over 1998 tailored beats). "Black N---a Killa" and "24 Hrs. To Live," which are alright, nothing special. Michel'le and the D.O.C. are also represented here, as is Above The Law. ATL's cuts that made it here are "Murder Rap" from 1990's Livin' Like Hustlers, and their classic 1994 "Black Superman" from Uncle Sam's Curse, a great cut for this comp considering few can afford U.S.C. cuz it's rare and expensive. Now, I wish a couple of Steffon's tracks could have been represented like "Funk Like Me," a slick G-Funk classic or "Frost Bit." Those 2 joints coulda made a 5 star collective. But still, a nice reflection, or intro for some, to Ruthless Records extensive catalog. R.I.P. Eazy.

When many people think of the Manhattans, they often think of them as a 70's and 80's soul, funk, and disco group with great hits as "Shining Star" (1980), "La La La Wish Upon A Star" (1976), and "There's No Me Without You" (1973), amont many, many other jams. However, The Manhattans go back to the 60's harmony groups like the Temptations, The Impressions, and The Delfonics among many others that were steeped deep in doo-wop harmony. Dedicated to You (1966) and Sing For You and Yours (1968) are that very element, rich harmony, and string laden arrengements that were awesome in the 60's soul and rock n' roll scene. I truly love this 2-fer that shows the group at the top of its game, even though they were also at the top of their game through the 70's as well. There are several standouts from both albums. In Dedicated..., one of my favorites is the beautiful doo wop classic, "Can I." It is a emotionally moving song beseeching a minister to grant him permission to kiss his young bride. I love the "rat tat's" in the song, and bring the feel of the late 50's to early 60's doo wop. The song "Follow Your Heart" is also a doo wop winner with perfect harmony that ponders the "puzzling thing" that love is. "I've Got Everything But You" is another wop/rock n' roll beauty. The harmony is impeccable here and is a true winner. "That New Girl" is a little more uptempo, and has a more mid to later 60's soul vibe, and is truly gorgeous with poetic lyrics about a beautiful girl new to town. There are also some cool dance-type rock n' roll jams here like "Teach Me (The Philly Dog)," "The Boston Monkey," and "The Manhattan Stomp," which will make you move your feet. This album is incredible and stands as one of my favorites and most played in my cd deck. The second album Sing For You and Yours has some incredible songs as well. There is still some doo-wop type songs on this ones as well. "Betcha Caouldn't Love Me" is one for sure, with again that perfectly honed harmony and sweet string arrangements. I love the beautiful, original doo wop Christmas song "It's That Time of the Year," a sweet ballad type of song, perfect for spending your holiday with your sweetheart. This album also has some sweet uptempo songs that sound appropriate for the late 60's soul explosion. "All I Need is Your Love," is that very example with faster tempo and a girl group chorus, a groovy dance type jam. "Alone on New Year's Eve," is a truly sad song with emotionally drenched passion. It returns to the slower ballad type formula. This 2-fer is a true gem in soul music. It shows the harmony roots of the Manhattans that they would continue to use in their 70's classics. This is a truly excellent start for a wonderful group. Anyone only familiar with the Manhattans of the 70's and 80's should really look into this one. I have a few of their 70's albums like the other Kent 2-fer There's No Me Without You/That's How Much I Love You (1973/1974), and the Manhattan's 1976 self-titled album with "Kiss and Say Goodbye" and La La La Wish Upon a Star," all classic albums for sure, but these first two albums, at least to me, stand up there with these 70's albums as my favorites. The Manhattans are a true doo-wop to disco group.

OutKast's debut: "Southernplayalisticadillacmusik" is nothing short of fire! It is a combination of great rhythm, neat lyrics, and bass heavy, early to mid 90's Dirty South G-Funk beats. This album is great lowrider music. A standout track is "Ain't No Thang," which has really deep head nodding bass, and hard hitting, hot headed gangsta lyrics from the Organized Noize duo! Some of the beats hint slightly at West Coast G-Funk like "Claimin' True," but even with that, you can see that the deep southern influence is the prevalent as it is throughout. This album was the launching pad for OutKast's rap and pop success, and rightly so.

It is easy to see where the south got the crunk from; this album is it. Unfortunately, the sub-genre has gotten too much mainstream attention nowdays and has sold out. I like crunk from back then; the crunk out now rarely if at all impreses me. This may be the original crunk album. Listen to the beats, a mix of crunk, bounce, rattle and G-Funk often all in the same songs. Eightball and MJG kill the mic in each track with relentless flows. They rap with such a force and hunger; they are hard core here. "9 Little Millimeta Boys" and "The First Episode" are grimy and the beats rattle on with some dope medley samples. "Pimps" is smooth with a laidback G-Funk melody. "Comin Out Hard" has another soulful G-Funk beat and slick gangster flows by both with some background horns. The sound quality is low due to the album being older (from 1993), but the old Suave House team definitely brought the ruckus, and Eightball and MJG produced their own music here. Great old school beats and angry rhymes, albums are simply not made like this anymore. These guys are legends, and this is where it all started!

Ball and G came with nothin short of fire in 1994's classic On the Outside Looking In. The album is loaded with hard, political, trill, and fiery lyrics, so you know they comin' real. Beatwise, the songs for the most part are immaculate, with a mix of that syrupy southern twang and whiny G-Funk. They come bangin' on wax on "Lick Em Up Shot" with a menacing beat. I love the Issac Hayes sample on No Mercy, paired with an awesome whiny keyboard riff. Ideas of the black experience and racism is totally evident on the classic "So What U Sayin'" with a classic guitar riff and keyboard driven G-Funk beat. The title track touches on the "pen," the "system," or the "tank,"whichever you prefer, and the realities surrounding it, all over a sick, melodic beat. All in all, this album deserves classic status because of the top-notch lyrics and production.

1998, Houston's Fat Pat finishes his classic debut album, Ghetto Dreams, and then dies, unfortunately before he realizes stardom. Now, Ghetto Dreams is an album I have been trying frustratingly and unsuccessfully to get for a while now. I decided to get this single "Tops Drop" which has 4 tracks, 3 mixes for "Tops Drop" (radio, local Houston mix, and instrumental), and radio edit for "Ghetto Dreams." Let me say, I now really want the album more than ever. "Tops Drop" is a slammin good time song about cruisin and poppin' trunk and bouncin.' The song is a simply put, a great time and gets me pumped up. The beat slaps real hard with a southern bounce and an electro G-Funk atmosphere. Lowride to this joint!!!! "Ghetto Dreams" at a glance may seem to be only a flossy track, but listen to it. Pat has a message; he tells you that he had to work from the ground up and stay focused and had no hand outs to achieve his dream. The track is also fun with another bouncy lowrider ready beat. Platinum Soul Prod. really did it up with the phat beats, and Jus Fresh Studios did a dope job mixing the local version of the single. I have had nothing but bad luck trying to buy the album, and this single makes me want it even more. At least, I have this single to give me a taste of the genius of Fat Pat and his hunger on his debut work.. R.I.P. to a playa who got his life took way too early.

Big Syke's first album is a striking contrast to what you would expect from a member from Tupac's (R.I.P.) Thug Life Crew. One would expect that it would be hard knock gangsta rap. However, Syke takes a 180 turn and throws out conscientious minded rhymes. In songs like "Why", "Wasted Talent" (f/ Mac Mall),he seems more concerned with educating youth about the reality of life and politics. He seems intent on helping young people think about the decisions they make in life. He gets reminiscent of his youth in "Good Timez." Overall, the album is sonically good. He puts in laid back g-funk beats, a few of which border on R&B and Soul. He does get a little gangsta in songs like "Highdollaz" with harder rhymes over old school Roger and Zapp like beats laced with the whiny keyboard synth in the hooks. It is a total lowrider song. He seems a little more upbeat and positive than his fellow Thug Life alumni!

Jay-Z's debut in 1996 with "Reasonable Doubt," was just a preview of the success to come to Jigga in the following years. This is a great album because he has really neat mafioso, bass heavy, classic New York style mid 90's beats. He has a tight rapping voice and a great, easily understandable flow. This album is at least as good as Nas' 96 album "It Was Written" simply for his clever lyrical style. He raps in an almost conversational style at times, and still manages to rhyme! The best song is "Dead Presidents II" because the beats are hard and heavy, and his flow is complex, but comprehendable.

The Delfonics are a classic Philly soul group from the late 60's and 70's. Primarily a rap fan, I was not even close to being born when these guys were doing their thing, but I feel that these times were the best for R&B. Lead singer William Hart has such a dope tenor voice, and his group drop some of the best choruses I have ever heard. The choruses complement Hart's solos so well. The music is slower to mid-tempo, my favorite style in R&B. This collection is perfect for anyone reminiscing on the good old days, or for any novices like myself who want a history lesson on the legacy of soul. "Trying To Make A Fool Of Me" (1970) has to be one of my favorite soul jams of all time, or should say, favorite song of any genre of all time. I love the funky beat and sitar twangs, and the heartbreaking lyrics. The chorus is simply amazing. "La-La Means I Love You" (1968) has a simple but gorgeous chorus. The harmony is simply amazing!! The beat is sweet for cuddling with ya boo on a gloomy, cold winter day, or riding with the top down. The horns on "Ready Or Not Here I Come" add a cool effect. These guys are some of the best crooners of all time. "Tell Me This Is A Dream" has an airy, and the vocals take you sky high. Anyone digging sweet soul music with awesome vocal ranges and harmonic choruses, the Delfonics are a group that had it goin' on. Too bad they were so underrated.

4-Tay comes back a year after "Off Parole," and does it again. He incorporates that fly g-funk sound you can ride to. He even adds the talk box to three of the tracks ("What's Wrong Wit The Game (w/E-40), "What Fo'" (even though it's faint), and "Shake It" (a great party jam)). There are a few filler tracks, but for the most part, it's tight. Some tracks are tight to lowride to!

The Autopsy was C-Bo's second album from 1994. It's only 6 songs deep, but is slams hella hard from start to finish. Each song has that slick, syrupy, and hard core G-Funk from the likes of Mobboss Prod. Mike Mosley is a hella tight producer for the yay and the Sac. C-Bo kicks in the tales of hood life with his unique flow. Even the laid back "Groovin On A Sunday" mentions having his "45 cocked." The radio edit of "Groovin.." is on his next full length, Tales From The Crypt (1995). The song "Ghetto Fligt" is sick with Bo and Pizzo tearing up the mic. The beat was also used on Bo's 1997 song "Ridin On My Bumper." The idea behind "Stompin In My Street" was also redone in 1995's "Stompin In My Steel Toes" but the latter features Marvaless, and the lyrics are different. Both versions are equally tight. This EP is short but sweet, and is totally hard throughout.

After dropping an street level classic in 1995 (The Natural), Mic Geronimo drops Vendetta in late 1997. There is a significant difference here than in The Natural. The beats and rhymes seem more tailored towards the mainstream audience. The beats are pretty dope and are more relaxed for the most part. Some beats still have that phat boom-bap flava like on the first album, yet many have more of a funky vibe (similar to G-Funk on a few). Production goes to many names, so a few include Irv Gotti, Puff Daddy, Buckwild, Pete Rock (yes!); even Twista's homie, the Legendary Traxster does a beat. One thing to note is that there are more playa, girl flirtin' joints here, which may be good or bad depending on the listener. The beats on those are cool and smooth with RnB hook vocals; joints like that include: "Single Life" f/ Jay-Z, and Buckwild's surprisingly almost G-Funk like "How You Been?." Pete Rock creates fire on the old-school boom-bap inflected "Unstoppable." Mic battle raps and kicks some reality with his trademark flow. "Nothin' Move But The Money" is the most commercial song here produced by Puffy and "Prestige." The lyrics deal with hustlin' and Puffy adds in some hook vocals. The beat is funky and upbeat. Legendary Traxster produces a maniacal keyboard and violin laced g-funk beat on "Vendetta," and his beat brings out a sick, fast flow and menacing lyrics by Mic. "Life In Lessons" has a serious tone to it and deals with issues in life and karma, and the beat has a nice vibe to it. "For Tha Family" has a neat soulful Boom Bap beat to it and brings the magic that The Natural brought 2 years before. "Usual Suspects" is a posse joint with the LOX, Ja Rule, DMX, and Tragedy Khadafi with a twangy beat and some background horns. All kick some gangsta flows. This album is definitely tight to bump, and mainstream and underground heads will both find something here that they will like.

Foesum really spit serious game in this album. The lyrics are tight, but even better, are the smooth g-funk beats often paired with silky R&B hooks and whiny keyboard synths that all fit together to make a solid album! On "Just Get Down," there is a nice funky P-Funk influenced bouncy beat with use of a talk box intermittently through the track. The album has some profanity, but it is not as pervasive as in many albums. If you like laid back Cali G-Funk, this one is for you!

May of 1997 brings a hard hittin and leanin H-Town banger by the Botany Boyz, homies of the Screwed Up Click. The album must have took a long time to make because there are some references to 1996 and even a couple to 1995. But the album simply slumps with that mannish mobb and G-Funk flava with a deep groove southern fried overture on some. This album is perfect for that gangsta lean and for lowriding down the avenue. The beats are unreal, some of the best from down south. I love the straight hood feel of "Botany Is Tha Block" with the sunny G-Funk beat, killa flows and whiny synths. There is a screwed vwersion by DJ Screw on the end of the album. "Cloverland" has a phat beat, a neat sunny background vibe with a Whodini beat pattern, a phat Texas anthem. The Boyz spit about the permanence of playa hatin' in the hood life in the lowrider whiny synth laden "Ain't Nu'in Changed;" the beat has a semi-west coast vibe to it as do many other joints here, and they do it well. "Smok'n N Lean'n" is a phat mobb-style joint with another whiny synth (there are more here than in a Dr. Dre album, which makes me happy because I love the whiny synth). Another mobb joint is "Snitches" with Bun B from UGK and another rapper I know little: Straight Texas Hoodlum. with a menacing beat and lyrics, with yet another dope whiny synth!I love the Zapp inflected title track, but the beat is slower than the actual sample for that leanin' feel. This album is not groundbreaking lyrically, but it is just so fun to listen to; the beats, vibes, and the dope flows will keep your head noddin' for hours. Let it blow ya speakers. Gangsta rap fans will love this and even west coast heads would like this one too.

Chicago soul legend Jerry Butler has a great career resume. He was doo-wopping with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions in the late 50's, and one of my favorite songs of all time is 1958's (or 1959's) "Gift Of Love," a gorgeous ballad with Butler's pleading lead vocals, and the song always without fail sends goosebumps up and down me, and the song was also re-released on Jerry Butler's solo album He Will Break Your Heart from 1960, and he made solo magic through the 60's and well beyond. Well at the end of the 60's, Butler hooks up with Philly soul magicians Gamble and Huff (Intruders, Blue Notes, O'Jays, etc), and again the listener is treated to another side of Mr. Butler. This CD is a 2-Fer of his end of 60's albums The Ice Man Cometh and Ice On Ice. Before the listener even opens up the album, he or she can see how classy the music is based on Mr. Butler's dapper appearance on both album covers, and yes, the music is just as classy. Gamble and Huff co-write with Jerry Butler and produce these albums. The production is immaculate, and Mr. Butler's baritone voice is extremely well-suited for the music. The Ice Man Cometh (tracks 1-11) is my favorite of the 2 albums here, and I believe is from late 1968 (I was born in the 80's, so I was not around for it), and has several classic RnB jams. One of my favorite songs here is "Never Give You Up," a great slower groove for the slow dance. "Hey, Western Union Man" is one of the lead singles here from 1968 and has great string orchestration, and deals with sending a message and candy and flowers to a loved one trying to get in touch with her. "Lost" is another cool song about being "lost ... but found in the nick of time" with respect to a difficult time finding a good romance. It is uptempo and uplifting. "How Can I Get In Touch With You" has again that magic Gamble and Huff orcestration, and the title is self-explanatory. Ice on Ice (tracks 12-22) was from 1969, and is another cool album. "Moody Woman" has some tropical background, somewhat islander, with a slight sitar like guitar twang, and is a cool mid-tempo groove. "What's The Use of Breaking Up?" is a midtempo song, dealing with the issue of not even bothering to break up because the relationship will just be made up again anyways. "Don't Let Love Hang You Up" reminds me a little of an up beat soul-rockabilly-rock soup of a song, with its tempo and instrumentation. In short, both late 60's album show off Jerry Butler's versatility and showcase Gamble and Huff's up and coming as producers. Any serious soul and RnB fans should check this 2-Fer set out for real music.

Well, I cannot say much more than what has been said about this 1992 gem. Pete Rock laces some great boom bap beats with loaded bass, and CL has a smooth flow and cool voice. Mecca and the Soul Brother is one of those albums that hit every emotion, and Pete Rock creates perfect soundscapes for each different song/theme. We have the emotion of love with the cool and breezy "Lots of Lovin," with rich and organic sunny orchestration. We also have the horny side of the duo with "Skinz" with a rich funk-loaded beat. Grand Puba makes an appearance as well. Another emotion is nostalgia and missing those who passed on like the jazzy-horn looped They Reminisce Over You. We have the tone of anger in "Anger in the Nation" with a harder, bass loaded, faster, and more tense tempo, and CL's voice and flow also represent some intense emotion. Pete Rock creates an interesting soundscape on his solo "Soul Brother # 1" with nice piano samples and screechy synths. He has the right to brag here about his capacity for soul. Pete Rock is extremely well-versed in soul, funk, and jazz: his more than obvious love for oldies is well-represented here. His samples will make any true music fan and hip-hop head dig in the crates. A fan of just about any type of music can find something about this record to love. And any rap, and hip-hop heads can branch out their music interests after listening to Pete Rock's production. CL Smooth is a true poet on the mic and writes some intricate rhymes and adds as much soul to the album as Pete Rock's beats do. 1991's All Souled Out EP, and 1994's The Main Ingredient are also absolutely fabulous and essential hip hop material and will have the same goosebump inducing effect as this masterpiece. This record stands the test of time as an all-time classic hip-hop album.

Flint Michigan's DFC came out with an interesting album in 1994. Backed with production by Warren G, DJ Slip, Swift, among others, you know it will have an inherent G-Funk influence. There are however, a few songs that didn't have the best beats. "Pass The Hooter" was produced by Warren G, and surprisingly, the beat and lyrics were only average! But, there were a few songs with beats and lyrics that are among the best of the best. "Mo' Love" is an absolute classic, with a soulful, laid back Dj Slip and Swift beat, georgeous G-Funk song about showin and gettin love in the hood, a perfect rider song, and one of my favorite G-Funk songs of all time!! "Caps Get Peeled" (prod. by Slip) f/ MC Eiht is a sick hood anthem over another soulful beat! "Roll With The Clan" is another sick rider banger. The title track has a fair beat, but Nate Dogg adds in sick vocals as usual in this track about the vicious cycle called the hood; the lyrics are decent. Overall, a tight album with a handful of bangers, a few classics, yet some dissapointments. The benefits way overweigh the dissapointments though! If you liked this one, I would reccomend MC Breed's Funkafied, also from 1994; that one is hot.

The Artifact's second album, 1997's That's Them is nothing short of fire. In fact, with the better production here, I find myself enjoying listening to this one more than their 1994 Between a Rock and a Hard Place. They bring a lotta heat with this one. Tame One and El Da Sensei both have a rich chemistry on the mic, and both combine for a great, entertaining listen. This, and the hot beats make for some ill boom bap straight out of New Jersey. The album opens with a brief dj cut produced by Rob "Beef" Tewlow, and scratches by DJ Kaos. The beat has a deep bass, and Kaos cuts up the beat nicely. Kaos does more scratching throughout the rest of the album. Production credits go to a lot of different names, but a few include Ken "Duro" Ifill, Buckwild, Lord Finesse, and a remix by Showbiz. My choice cut here is Showbiz' remix for "The Ultimate." Showbiz's beat is slammin,' as is the beat to the original. The beat is dramatic and laced with as hard bassline, and menacing drums. That joint along with the original is, and many other songs here are fierce flowing battle raps and full of braggadocio definitely merited. Remember, these guys have skills, and also consider that the "jiggy era" was in full effect. That's Them is a refreshing alternative to all that stuff. I totally dig the "Collaboration of Mics" with Lord Finesse and Brand Nubian's Lord Jamar. The beat is raw and unadulterated boom bap, not glossy and shiny as many joints were in 1997. They trade vicious flows and stomp out the competition. "Ingredients to Time Travel" with a somewhat abstract type beat, which provides a cool atmosphere, and it sounds like doo wop horns or something of the like in the background. They represent again who reigns supreme in real hip-hop. They revisit the 1994 "Wrong Side of the Tracks," with a sequel: "Return to the Wrongside." I like the beat to this one better; it is smooth and sophisticated, although I liked the funkiness of the 1994 one too. That's Them definitely represents what I love about true hip hop, great beats, good chemistry on the mic and between producer and emcee. This is an ill album that flew under the radar, although "The Ultimate" did appear on a 1996 soundtrack High School High. This album will pump you up, and definitely sounds hot in the whip. Between a Rock and a Hard Place is also definitely a must have for hip hop purists and fans alike. Heads that are bored with hip hop now who had never heard this one will be restimulated and reenergized by this one.

1974's Mighty Love album again shows the Spinners on right track with Thom Bell, Linda Creed and Bruce Hawes along with the smooth harmony, and Bobbie Smith and Philippe Soul Wynne's leads. The sound is very well polished. "Ain't No Price On Happiness" is a great song about the games played in love. "I'm Coming Home" with the famed Bell/Creed production/writing, has a down home southern funk feel, upbeat and lively. "I'm Glad You Walked In My life" is a little slower, and a real sweet ballad for the ears. "Since I've Been Gone" is a nice mid-tempo jam about losing love during a hiatus. The title track is a sweet mid-to-uptempo jam and will get you pumped. On this cd release of the album, there are a few bonus songs left over from early 70's, and they are decent. I like the Jimmy Roach(think of some of the Dramatics produtions) laced "(Oh Lord) I Wish I Could Sleep" with a nice midtempo vibe and light strings.

EightBall & MJG came out with a certified banger in 1995 with On Top Of The World. These southerners bring the heat with nice pimpin' flows over smooth bass-heavy beats. Some of the beats approach a west coast, even better, a Bay area feel to them such as in "Top Of The World" with a vocoder in the hook. The beats throughout the album are fun and perfect to ride to. "Pimp In my Own Rhyme" is a little harder showing how they are on top of the pimp game and are in charge. "What Do You See" is a funky, melodic track, a perfect hood anthem. E-40 and Mac Mall appear in the track "Friend Or Foe," so you know that this south and west connection is comin' tight with each's unique flows. I love the beat in "For Real;" with whiny synths and a funky guitar riff, an immaculate combo in G-Funk. The dynamic duo talk about keepin' it real and shakin' the fakin' in the rap game and in life. This album will satisfy any west coast and southern rap fan. Really, any rap fan will find enjoyment in On Top Of The World.

New Orleans' BG comes out hard on his 2nd, yes, his 2nd album: Chopper City from 1996-1997. Mannie Fresh brings those hot beats, drawing upon the Southern Fried funk of the 1990's with a G-Funk twist. "Retaliation" brings BG trading verses with Juvenile and Bun B from UGK over a laid back G-Funk beat, a certified southern classic. "Uptown Thang" puts it down for the N'Awlins. "Order 20 Keys" is the drug track with hot fast beats and a whiny synth. "Play'n & Laughin'" is an interesting track beatwise; musically it is very distinct. The beat is fast in the background with an interesting beat sequence in the foreground. "So Much Death" is sadder; BG kicks in tales of hood casualties and how they hit close to home; he also discusses how his late father put him up on game and was there for him. The beautiful beat samples Zapp "Be Alright." All in all, this album is awesome with that late 90's Cash Money type beats. Mannie Fresh's early beats are tight and original, and BG's delivery and rapping voice are tight and distinct.

New Orleans native, but Texas bred Big Mike goes out on the solo tip after 1993's Geto Boys Til Death Do Us Part, and his 1991 collabo with 3-2 on the Convicts album. With producers like John Bido, Mike Banks N.O. Joe, "Pee Wee," Simon Cullins, u gotta a tight team on the beats, which draw upon the southern fried funk nature For the most parts, the beats bang, but a couple leave a little more to be desired. Big Mike though is on point throughout with his slick drawl and decent flow. He gets flossy on "Havin Thangs" over a raw but funky beat. He gets his ride on in the bouncy "Creepin-Rollin.'" He discusses love and romance in the ghetto on what else, "Ghetto Love" over a nice G-Funk beat. He deals with absent fathers in "Daddy's Gone" with Mr. Scarface. Big Mike can be serious when discussing social matters, but he can also be fun and relaxing in other songs. He also gets his thug on on "Smoke Em and Choke Em" with an old-school funk inspired beat. All in all, it has near classic potential. If u like this one, u need to check out "Still Serious," his next album from 1997. The production on that album is a bit better. Somethin' Serious is a definite must buy for your collection, especially for heads on the 3rd and West Coast.

Houston, Tx's DMG has his chance to represent for the Rap-A-Lot legacy in 9-Trey, and does it real well. N.O. Joe peoduces 99 percent of the album and laces it with deep-fried Texas funk that is heavy and hard. If you like the hard spits of Scarface, C-Bo, and Brotha Lynch Hung, you probably will like this one. Like fellow reviewer CTRX explains, his voice is even real similar to Scarface's, and his flow is similar at times, but his voice is slightly higher-pitched. The whole album is full of raw and hard core gangbanging imagery. "Prison Riot" has a P-Funk type sample, and sounds a bit like G-Funk. He is angry about maybe not getting out of prison to see his baby be born, and exclaims the harsh reality of life behind bars, and heads plan a violent breakout. "Rest In Peace" is a somber reflection on homies deceased with a more relaxed, but gloomy G-Funk beat. "Buck Em Down" features 2-Low, Geto Boys, 5th Ward Boyz, and 3-2 and is a stompin hard mobb joint by the Rap-A-Lot thugs, one of my favorite joints. The beat is raw and hard with a neat whiny synth to add to the menacing feel to it. The bass is crazy here! The realities of the drug trade from a non-glorified view (not like today's trap-rap) is are analyzed on "Pure Dope, No Cut" over a deep groove, twangy beat. DMG really keeps it raw and trill here, and this album rivals some of the best albums by Rap-A-Lot. He does not release another solo album for a whole decade (2003's Black Roulette), but appears on Devin's 1998, The Dude, Facemob's 1996 The Other Side Of The Law (as a member), and Geto Boys 1998 Da Good, Da Bad, And Da Ugly (as a replacement for Bushwick Bill). This album is mad rare and expensive, but it is highly recommended for the quality of music. Save up the extra scrill and get this.

Bushwick Bill finally goes solo in 1992 with Little Big Man. With production by John Bido, James Smith, and additional touches by Roger Tausz, and Mike Dean, you get some tight southern fried gangsta beats. "Chuckwick" and "Skitzo" are crazy personifications of his alter ego, with a crazy beat. Bushwick is very sexually explicit and he has a huge boastful personality on joints like "Take 'Em Off" and the title track. "Stop Lying" is dope. The beat is slow rolling, similar to G-Funk, and the lyrics are funny. He pulls a dude's hoe card about boasting and lying about his sex life. "Dollars And Sense" also has an early G-Funk vibe. The beat is P-Funk centered with a slick Dr. Dre-like whiny synth in the hook. Bill holds nothing back on the album, and censors nathan here. Dope album with some funky fried beats for your trunk. Be sure to check his 1995 classic album Phantom Of The Rapra, a hella great album full of more of this fire he spits.

Kokane comes out in 1994 with what I believe is his 2nd album: Funk Upon A Rhyme. Many heads nowdays recognize him as cat who does the hook on many West Coast rappers' songs. He has that moany whiny but likeable voice you hear 100 times on Snoop Dogg's Tha Last Meal and on some of Above The Law's works. His 1994 Ruthless release is very unique. Some of it is hard to define as to whether if it is rap or just funk. Overall, there is a heavy P-Funk inflected G-Funk flava to it. Cold 187um from Above The Law definitely produces some interesting beats. A couple beats are hard to get into such as "From The Funk To The Back" and The Rasta inflected "Funkinmuffin," but there are some beats that are simply unbelievable!! My fav is "Aftermath" where Above The Law steps in and spits some gangsta game over a bumpin lowrider beat. "S--- G--d--m" is a hot party jam with a bouncy beat. Kokane lights a spliff on the "Slow Burnin 22.5 Degrees Farenheit" with a semi disco-funk beat. Now, there are some weird songs here where he does too much whining, which takes away from the listenability of a couple like on "I Need Representation," even though the lyrics take on subjects like brothas deserving some help dealing with issues in their lives and how the system can be unfair and biased. Despite the drawn out vocals, the beat is some nice slow funk perfect for the ride. This album has taken some time to grow on me, but I am starting to get into the groove with it though. Not flawless by a long shot, but definitely interesting and different. Definitely off the beaten path. The thing is, this album is hella rare now selling for as much as 60-80 bucks. I like the ambition and efort Kokane put into this album, and eventhough it does not work all the time, it is a neat endeavor throught the space boogie of tripped out funk. This album will continue to grow on me as I listen to it more and more.

Teddy Perndergrass's Greatest Hits is a good way to experience Teddy's music for the first time, like I did. It includes several of the highlights of his career like "Love TKO," "When Somebody Loves You Back", "Joy" and many others. I recommend this to anybody just getting into oldschool soul and funk, or into Teddy himself. Teddy has a gruff, but romantic voice, and has a great vocal delivery skill. The beats are clean too.

The album We Are The Imperials predates my birth by 23-24 years (1958 or 1959-1982), but I do recognize where good music comes from: Litlte andthony and the Imperials represent good music. We Are... is an album filled with different styles witin the doo-wop/early rock realm. I am sure some of the songs are covers, like "Somewhere over The Rainbow" and a few others, but regardless, each song is handled with craft and the utmost class. Little Anthony Anthony Gourdine) has a great tenor/falsetto, and the Imperials provide perfect harmony. The most racognizable song here is the perennial classic "Tears On My Pillow," which is a staple in RnB and soul, a classic slow drag. Another doo-wop winner is "Two People in the World," which rings with innocence and true love as opposed to the relentlessly blatant sexual prowess of many RnB acts of today, and is a refreshing change. "Wishful Thinking" also has that sweet innocence but with heartbreak lyrics about a relationship gone bad. "What Did I Do" also has a similar vibe and tone. I love the guitar licks on this one. We also have the faster paced rock jams like "Cha Cha Henry" and "Oh Yeah" which are cool. Little Anthony's lead on the latter is some pure poetry and is a fun jam to vibe to and will make your head not incessantly. We Are The Imperials is a fun album to listen to, and represents a period of time when Doo Wop, Rock and Roll and early Soul and RnB were branching out, an exiting time of music I was not around to experience.

Being born in the 80's I did not get the chace to grow up with classic RnB soul and doo wop, but I feel closer to those types of music than any other music besides classic 50's and 60's rock, and yes, hip-hop. Formerly a totally hip hop obsessed guy, my tastes over the last few years have leaned heavily towards RnB and oldies rock leading me to soul greats like the Stylistics, Delfonics, Four Tops among countless others, and to lesser know soul groups like the Brothers of Soul. The Brothers of Soul comprise a late 60's and early 70's RnB/neo-doo-wop harmony group that was overlooked for sure. "I Guess That Don't Make Me a Loser" (1968) is a wonderful neo-doo-wop classic with sweet strings and perfect harmony, dealing with staying strong after losing a relationship, one of my now favorite soul grooves. "Try It Babe" (1971) is a beautiful mid-tempo groove and exemplifies the intricate harmony the guys have. "Can't Get You Off Of My Mind" (1967) shows again the group's doo-wop influence with its beautiful simplicity. Every other song on this compilation is also a winner, and is a refreshing change of pace from the overly complex and synthetic electronic arrangements that pervade music today, also including "autotune" vocal enhancement. Back in the day singers had voices to be heard, and these guys perfectly exemplify that. This compilation receives much rotation in my collection alongside more famous groups like the Delfonics, Temptations, Intruders and many, many more. It took me a long time to even find out about them, and boy am I glad I did. Give these lesser known soul brothers a chance. Their soul will blow your mind.

1995, D of Trinity Garden Cartel drops a straight, loc'd and looney heated album under Cartel Records. This album is rare because it seems to be long out of print, but it is a Houston winner. The lyrics are straight up in your face gangsterism. The beats were recorded on inferior equipment, like on the Trinity Garden Cartel album, Don't Blame It On Da Music from 1994, but despite some lower sound quality here and there, the beats are straight up bangin' southern fried funk straight out the Bayou served by Michael Banks (most of the album, just like on Don't Blame It...), Loranzo Samuels, and Reginald "Smoked Out Reggie" Hackett. D ain't nathan nice on the mic, and he comes agg throughout. DMG stops by and kicks some serious ish with D on "Sittin In My Cell." The 2 drop some serious flows about being behind bars and facing the reality of it instead of rejecting it. D drops some spits about coming hard up as a youngster and how it all caught up with him. "Texas Tray" is a sick joint with a minimalist menacing beat about dealing with the Texas justice system (being on parole), and staying strapped on the shief streets. "For You People" seems a little more upbeat with a unique G-Funk style beat and Mike Dean adding a vocorder in the hook. D analyzes the trappings of the hood and how to learn from them to move on in life. The title track is where D flexes his gangster over a menacing twangy G-Funk beat. We have a nice hard beat with a deep, deep groove twang from out the swamp on "I'm So Cool." He does a cool job telling a story comin' up in the game. "Rollin' Gruesome" is pretty self-explanatory, and is a sick psycho joint with a nice rollin' beat. If you like real gangster rap with menacing beats and sick spits, then Straight Texas Hoodlum is recommended if you save up some extra ends because this one often goes for more than 50-60 bucks. This one is a sick, underrated gangsta classic from H-Town.

In late 1994, Sacramento, Cali's Marvaless answers her earlier 1994 album Ghetto Blues with a 5 track EP. She can hold her own on the mic as well as C-Bo, her homie from Sac Town. She can spit and for a rediculous reason or another, she went under the radar. She can hold her own very well with Lil Kim and Foxy Brown any day. She represents that Cali lifestyle well here and has good production by DJ Daryl, Mike Mosely and Sam Bostic which draws on a hard knock G-Funk sound similar to C-Bo's albums, so fans of his will find a familiarity with this EP. The title track has a funk sample that has been sampled millions of times, and the beat is a little derivative, but the joint is cool. The rest of the beats on the EP are much better. She lays down how she came up in the game. She flows hella tight here. "That's How We Creep" features her and Pizzo tradin' gangsta spits over a menacing beat. "Ride With Me" is a cool, laidback keyboard melody ridden G-Funker perfect to roll to on a sunny day. The beat is chill, but her flow is fierce here. "Hard Core" is another menacing whiny synth ridden joint with C-Bo flexin their skills and their gangsta buckin' down wack MC's. C-Bo would also have this song on his 1995 Tales From The Crypt with a slightly different beat. "Jealous B--ches" is a cool faster paced joint with a cool whiny synth puttin' green eyed ladies in they place. This is a cool EP and any gangsta rap and G-Funk fan will find a lot to like about this lil' gem. Time to give dap to a trill MC.

C-Bo comes real tight on his 1995 album "Tales From the Crypt"(re-released in 2002). He has a hard flow, and even harder, menacing beats, with frequent use of the whistly keyboard synth. His beats are generaly hard core, bass heavy G-Funk. If you love lowrider music, this one is premium!

Kurupt's third solo effort: Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey has something for just about every hip-hop fan. It has some mainstream pop-rap: "It's Over," The album also has G-Funk: 1)"Can't Go Wrong," (DJ Quik heats up the production! Nice funky beat with a jazzy hook.) 2)The title cut, which you can lowride to! and 3) "Sunshine" with an old-school beat. and finally 4) "At It Again" with use of a talk box and a fast party beat! The album also caters to the hard-core fan: 1) "The Hardest" 2)"On Da Grind." The album has appeal to even rock fans: 1)"Lay it on Back" w/ Fred Durst (does have a hip-hop beat, though). The album also has a few songs with an underground feel like "On, Onsite" w/ Lil 1/2 Dead. The different styles and Kurupt's unique personality make this album a neat addition to your rap collection. This album is not so much set trippin' and gang banging as in Tha Streetz Iz A Mutha (though that one is tight too!) This is his main party album, something to relax to and party to!

Queens, NY duo, Havoc and Prodigy came out with a tight album in 1995. They have a tight, complex flow, and extraordinary beats that are menacing, and at times, scary. The album starts off and ends with a bang! There is virtually no filler, nor any whack beats here! This is one of the best East Coast rap albums ever. It is a shame that Mobb Deep had to live in the shadow of Biggie and their queens neighbor, Nas (no offense to the both of them).

Xzibit's first album is great. He sets the standard higher for underground rap. He is a lyrical wizard and has a tight rapping voice. He does not follow the commercialized conventions of rap. He is a Westcoast MC who sees no beef between the West and East (for this album came out in 1996, the height of the so called "coast battle"); in fact, most of his beats sound similar to the hardcore East Coast beats of the mid 90's, but with his own witty twist. He is intelligent and well spoken, and lets it be known that he will be around for a while.

Believe it or not, this is my first album, essentially, my intro to Rodney O and Joe Cooley, old school west coast legends. This album was released in early 1998. But, this album is a collection of the last studio sessions the 2 had together. A few songs are as old as 1995, as many of the songs have the mid 90's vibe. This album is all G-Funk straight thru with a bouncy vibe perfect for the lowrider and a house party. The beats are hella phat!!!!! If you like old school 80's style funk samples twisted into talkbox ridden bounce, this west coastin thumper is for you. Like the other reviewer states cleverly and on point, that fans of the Zapp and Roger legacy, and fans of Zapp sampled hip-hop will absolutely dig this one. "Funk In Yo Face" definitely slaps hard with that Cali Fonk that helped me fall in love with G-Funk in the first place. These 2 have great chemistry and a decent flow on this whole album.. It will not break any new lyrical ground, but that is not their plan. They want you to get your boogie on, and they want you to sit sideways and roll slow, loud, and bangin down the avenue as you floss your whip! This album is perfect for the sunny Cali ride. If you have a tricked out chrome trimmed Schwinn Lowrider Bike (or tricycle) fitted with a stereo system, bump this album; the two elements go like butter on toast!

D-Shot gets more cuddies from the bay and LA to put together his second installment of Boss Ballin. The first (1995)was an absolute classic with the creme de la creme of West Coast artists. This one is a minor step down. "We Came To Rock Ya Body" is a sick 707-310 collabo w/ The Click, Dogg Pound and Snoop over a melodic Studio Ton G-Funk beat. In fact, most the album has sick G-Funk beats that by 1998, the year of this comp, were becoming scarce. The sickest song here, is E-40's solo, "Watch Where Ya Lay Ya Head" with a talk box in the hood and a sick, bouncy lowrider beat, another Studio Ton masterpiece. Kurupt lays down some deep rhymes about life in "Keep Tryin" over a slick, smooth, laid back scorching, Studio Ton beat with Deon's sexy voice in the hook. Other bay cats like The Mossie and Messy Marv lay down some sick verses. Ton even laces Redman and Keith Murray a beat in the hot East meets West scorcher, "Rollin'." Levitti and Deon have a cool R&B track, "Life." Ant Banks lays an interesting beat for Too $hort and Baby D in "Twisted." Shot Calla may have not beat his first comp, but this one certainly has a lot to offer the West Coast rap fanatic.

DJ Quik hits the mainstream with a bang in "Quik Is The Name." Here, he starts his trademark old school P-Funk vibe that would be prevalent in most of his future work. Sure, Dre deserves a lot of the credit for starting the G-Funk craze of the 90's, but Quik deserves at least as much of the credit too!! His beats are nothing short of phenomenal. The beat on "Tonite" is ahead of its time; it sounds like it could have came out in '95 or '96. He keeps it old school on tracks like "8 Ball" and "Quik Is The Name." His rhyming is good and his style is entertaining. The songs are funky, laced with the twist of the turntable. He isn't too hard core, but he still has a street credibility. Cop it!!!!

O.C. drops his 1994 debut Word...Life to no fanfare in 1994. I am definitely a late bloomer to this one. Better late than never. I have heard nothing but praise and hype by underground heads. I definitely had to check this one out. I love Omar Credle's word play; he can definitely flow with the best of them. The title track will prove that. There, he explains real life situations, and he drops philosophy about rap and pulls wack MC's hoe cards. Buckwild's beats are off the wall, and have a deep groove boom-bap with cool jazz and funk inflections. DJ Ogee and Lord Finesse add their magic touch to a few others also. "Born 2 Live" has a neat soul sample, and The Organized Konfusion produced remix is my favorite beat here because it has a cool but energetic pulsating feel to it. This song discusses the pitfalls of life and comes straight from O.C's heart. He discusses growing up and death and many other things here. "Ga Head" is a jazz horn-laden boom bap banger where O.C. knocks on a woman who did him wrong. His tone here is angry and painful. On "No Main Topic" he battle raps and exclaims that the only way to get him is with a gun. He rightly boasts about his rap skills with a slick butta flow. He then goes on about the mass confusion of being chased and caught by one-time (police) in what else "Constables" with a menacing drum laden beat. He has to watch his back for fear his skin color will make him an easy target, even though he commits no crimes. "O Zone" is a cool-spacey keyboard and horn laden banger with O.C. dropping poetry about having skills on the mic. He then tells a chilling tale of crime getting caught up with Colombian crime lords in "Story" with another eerie, haunting beat. I know the original 1994 album is rare, but there is no excuse not to cop the 2008 rerelease because this album is full of intelligent well phrased rhymes and excellent production. I was geekin' when I heard this one for the first time. Is it worth the aforementioned hype? Yes, without a doubt. The mid-90's were called the golden era because of classics like this one.

1994, Cleveland, Ohio's, Bone Thugs record their first album for ruthless with their current group name, a short EP. They had an album from 1993 under the name of B.O.N.E. Enterprise, called Faces Of Death, which I have yet to hear. I'm glad Eazy-E signed these cats so they could blow up. Creepin' On Ah Come Up is full of great harmonization and killa spits by BTNH over G-Funk beats that couldn't have better suited their style. The pairing of slow to mid tempo beats really complement their often rapid speed and when theyb rap slower. DJ Yella produces the most of the album, while Rhythm D does 1, and DJ Uneek does 2 joints, and BTNH produces one and co-produces another. The title track is a slow rollin' beat with a nice whiny synth to roll slow to at night. "Foe Tha Love Of $" features Eazy-E over a smooth beat and is one that helped the group blow up. They do what they gotta to get paid, even if it is illegal and bloody. "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" is one that also helped them blow up and is a standard setter for their music here and later on. Yella laces a nice whiny synth lead beat, and you can hear BTNH rap on beat even while slowing or speeding up their flows, a hard feat. Rhythm D laces a stone-cold, mobbin' beat on "Down Foe My Thang" with a piercing whiny synth only he can do, and Bone rips the track with harsh, violent flows, a phat "get yours however you can" joint. Their flow ability is definitely showcased here. "Moe Cheese" is an instrumental of "Foe The Love of $." "No Surrender" is bangin.' I love the dark keyboard ridden beat and the vocorder laced hook. Here, they paint gothic and dark imagery like they do pretty much on this whole album. Out of the 8 tracks, 5 are songs, and the other 3 are the intro and 2 skits. This album definitely showcases their hunger, their hit-making potential, and their beloved harmonious, at times sing-rapping style that would be popular for the next half-decade. This album is a must have for any BTNH fan or any other serious rap fan.

40 Water is an OG in the rap game, and it shows in many ways. He has been rapping since the 80's; he has several hit records, and he is the godfather of that slang you hear everyone biting off of today. This album is loaded with that flow we love from 40, humorous, rapid, and firey. While this album has a few weak beats and some filler, there is definitley some classic material here. Bosko laces some phat, old-school-meets-new- school G-Funk beats in the bangers "All Tha Time" and "Doin' Dirt Bad" (both w/ B-Legit), both perfect for lowriding. The hard core track "Money Scheme" shows Jayo Felony and 40 killin' the mic with their unique flows. "Hope I Don't Go Back" is a timeless G-Funk classic. Here, E shows his vulnerable side contemplating what he may have to return to if his success ran out. "Ballin' Outta Control" is a classic re-release dug up from his classic 1994 EP The Mail Man. "My Hoodlums and Thugz" is a fun bouncy G-Funk selection with Mack 10 and WC. Another classic is "From The Ground Up" (w/ Too $hort and K-Ci and JoJo), where Short and E reminisce about blowin' up in the game with phat hooks all over a smokin' Ant Banks beat. If it weren't for the filler, this one would get 5 stars and rank up there near In a Major Way.

Possibly one of the best soul groups in history, The Isley Brohters have countless music from a half century span of time. My favorites of their work consist of their slow and slower mid-tempo love jams, which is why I am so into this love songs collective. Most of my favorite songs like "For The Love Of You," "Between The Sheets," "Footsteps In The Dark," "Make Me Say It Again, Girl'" and a personal fav, the spiritual and mystical "Voyage to Atlantis," one of the best songs of any genre ever conceived. Unfortunately, "Caravan Of Love" by Isley, Jasper, Isley is not here, perhaps for it not being a slower jam. Regardless, Love Songs is an awesome intro or reflective of the Isley family genius.

Long Beach has been for a long time a breeding ground for smokin hip-hop artists and groups. Snoop Dogg gets Goldie Loc and Tray Dee and creates a rap supergroup. Tha Eastsidaz come together for a fully heated debut album. The album features those clean cut G-Funk beats that could only have come out of Long Beach, Cali. In fact, even though the album came out in early 2000, it has the magic and funk of a mid 90's G-Funk era album. DPG and Eastsidaz put the west back on the map with a phat album. Phat tracks like "G'd up" & "Got Beef" got mad radio play out in the west. Other standouts are the smooth "LBC Thang" where the homies rep their city. Then, there is "Be Thankful" where the trio, along with Warren G, Pretty Tony, and kam, give love to the ones that put them up on the game of life, over a nice, relaxing slower beat. it is a long album, 22 tracks (a few skits), and it is well worth the used space. The album is a G-Funk classic. West coast rap fans need to have this, and any rap fan could appreciate this hot release.

Herm, a street activist from San Francisco, Cali, gets some cuddies from the yay area to drop a phat compilation for the 1995 season. Primo drops a sick joint "City Of Da Players." The beat is a mix of Frisco Mobb Music and G-Funk with killa flows and a dope Dr. Dre influenced whiny synth. N.O.H. Mafia drops some mainy knowledge on the bouncy "Voices In My Head." Hitman, from RBL Posse, drops us a classic horror joint "The Reeper." You can find this joint on his solo debut: Solo Creep, also from 1995. T-Lowe and 187 Mob hits us with "Creepy Crawling," a phat horror joint with a slick whiny synth; this cut can also be found on T-Lowe's 1995 album Keep It Real. Lets put it simply, if you want a collection of hard core, hot headed, Frisco Mobb music by some dope underground, lesser-known rappers, this is a prime album for you. You also get U.D.I., 3-Deep, Female Fonk, Young Life, and many more also here. Don't sleep.

Kam's 2nd album, Made In America is an absolute classic. He raps about life, and focuses many of his bars on solutions. One prime example is the classic "Keep Tha Peace." First, Warren G laces Kam with one of the best G-Funk beats in rap history. I love the keyboards and the background rap samples in the hook. Kam spits fire about trying to maintain unity and not let negative outside influences color one's self. Battelcat also burns the wax with a few smokin beats. Just listen to how the beat develops in the beginning of "Way'a Life" and "Trust Nobody." Those are also among some of the finest G-Funk beats ever conceived. A lot of times R&B hook vocals in G-Funk may be average, but the hook vocals in both tracks sound dope. Kam is an intelligent and humble rapper, and it's fresh to hear him compared to flossy, Benz drivin' gangbangers. Phat Bay Area producers E-A Ski and CMT lace up a melodic beat in "Pull Ya Hoe Card," where Kam raps cleverly about dishonorable bustas in the game. DJ Quik serves heat in the "That's My N---a" beat with that P-Funk influence he is well-known for. Made In Americe is an absolute classic from start to finish with much more to offer than what I just mentioned. One can write an entire essay about this release.

1996, A hardly known L.A. rapper Dazzie Dee releases a cool, cruisin album full of fun rhymes and great production. DJ Battlecat, a real reliable beatsmith out west produces half of the album, and his beats really showcase his skills. His G-Funk here is among some of the best out there. Chances are that at least half the times you see a lowrider cruisin' by you in L.A., there will be a Battlecat joint blaring in it. Dazzie handles a nice chunk of the production, and does it very well too. Clint "Payback" Sands does the beat for the bouncy opener "Tha Ultimate Drive-By." Many of Dazzie's rhymes are about flirtin and sex and with getting caught up with bad women, and there are also some gangsta joints here and there. His lyrics are not mind-bending, but are more for a fun and relaxing listen. "Knee Deep" is a deep groove Battlecat banger and includes his trademark vocorder. He gets a little gangsta, but still lighthearted, and the song is a prime ride banger. One of my fav's here is "Ain't No Bustas This Way," a P-Funk vibin' Battlecat thumper with Dazzie, K-Dee, and Ice Cube trading spits and calling out fake mc's. Dazzie Dee laces a real tight melody driven beat on "Once Upon A Time." His flow is pretty tight here and is another cool, cruisin joint. "On My Cide" is for the ladies with Dee, Coolio, and Chill MC (Compton's Most Wanted) and a cool deep Battlecat vocorder laced beat, a nice cool laidback joint. The title joint has a great electro laced G-Funk bouncer beat by Dee himself. He touches upon some of life's hardships especially growing up in the hood. If there were more deeper joints like this on the rest of the album, I may have given it 5 stars. "Unda Da Table" has yet another bangin' Battlecat lowrider ready beat with some sick whiny keyboard riffs. The lyrics are horny and sex charged. Let me re-iterate, the beats on this album are on a classic level; each beat is on another level. Beats like these are why I have been such a G-Funk fan for awhile. Overall, this album is a slept-on G-Funk banger lost among better known artists like Warren G, DJ Quik, Dre, Snoop (I love them too though!). West Coast heads should really check for it.

Hi-C comes back 2 years after his debut, 1991's Skanless. 1993's Swing'n is an interesting album with a neat mix of sex rhymes, some social commentary, some boasting, and some neat funky beats. Production is held by Hi-C, homie Tony A, and the Half Heads. My copy is the 2004 re-release with 2 bonus tracks. The album is a neat early G-Funk era album with dope production, raw at times, since it was made in '93. My favorite joint is "Got It Like That." The beat is raw and old-school style, with a great whiny synth, not unlike the ones Dr. Dre did on The Chronic and Doggystyle. The beat is phat and is fun to listen to. A neat social comentary track is "What's Going On" with a soulful beat and deeper lyrics about life in the hood. "The Devil Made Me Do It" is eerie, with a crazy, twangy beat. "Wannabe" is harder edged. The beat is phat with a broken whiny synth with a P-Funk sample, and Hi-C bucks down fake bustas who wanna be him. "F--- A 40 Oz." is neat; Hi-C would rather down a half gallon (64 oz) of malt licquor. "Stank" is raunchy about the women's spot, and I am not big about sex rap, but the woozy beat and whiny synth line is tight. Hi-C maynot be a great lyricist, but he is funny and entertaining, and the beats rock. The bonus 2004 tracks at the end are cool. Lyrically, not groundbreaking, but the songs are tight regardless. "Get The Money," is a lighthearted hustler track produced by DJ Quik. The beat is phat G-Funk updated for 2004. Ph Ph is the other bonus. The beat is another G-Funk smoker by Quik, and is a party starter. Overall, the album, original or rerelease, is a good listen, not flawless, but fun and funky.

First of all, I mean to give this album 5 stars. Swoop G takes the LBC by storm in 1997 with Undisputed. he is a tight lyricist, and adapts well to his variable beats. Beatwise, the general feel is, of course, G-Funk. A few beats may be a little weak, but then there are several that are surefire classics. The standout track is "G's house." The beat takes you back to a time when the West was on top, and fun, relaxing G-Funk beats were blazing in stereos all around. it is perfect for lowriding around the town. Some Bay area heavy hitters like 3X krazy, Cydal, and The Luniz rap on the album, and some others like Bosko produce hot tracks like "Gangsta in California," and JT Bigga Figga creates fire on "Who Got the Gangsta S--- pt.II." So, there is a medley of a Long Beach and Bay Area feel to the whole record. So, despite a couple of songs with weaker beats, the album is a definite late 90's banger!

AllFrumTha i's self titled debut is nothing short of slammin. It is a typical Westside Connection-type album with production be Mack 10 and cameos by the WSCG bunch (10, Ice Cube, WC, Comrads.....) but it outshines most of the others' work because the beats are strong. The album is hard core G-Funk. "County Jail" is tight; they tell a chilling tale of going to jail among enemies over a sample of Roger and Zapp's "So Ruff, So Tuff" you can lowride to. "Caps" is a hard core song with a tight beat. Too bad there weren't more songs on this 14 track album (4 of them being inserts). This album is one of the best late 90's rap albums out there.

Retaliation Revenge And Get Back comes in early 1998, most definitely not at the height of the G-Funk era, but of course, the album has the feel of it. The beats are bangin from start to finish, with a hungry Daz killing the mic with his killa flows. Daz is both a rapper and producer, both he does extremely well. The best joint is "O.G." where he, Snoop and Nate Dogg unite and bring that mobbin Death Row style they all brought years earlier, over a smooth, both laid back, yet mobbin' beat that defines the LBC sound! "Baby Mama Drama" is a serious analysis on how some fathers get stiffed by their baby mamas, even when they are there for their kids and provide for them, over a laid back G-Funk beat. "Gang Bangin A-- Criminal" is another classic. After a long intro, the song rolls on with a hard knock mobbin' beat and serious flows from Daz, and a whole gang of his ESLB cuddies like Bad Azz, Tray Deee, and many more. Daz puts it down for Cali, on his classic anthem, "In California," over one of those hot lowrider beats, a definite West Coast anthem. There is much much more to offer through the rest of the album. Definitely a must add for your G-Funk and gangsta rap collection.

On 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, with some production by Daz Dillinger and DJ Quik, and various LA and Bay area guests, we have a powerhouse and a well rounded album. Just about every song on here is listenable, and many are classic. The album ranges from contemplative life and death ballads ("Life Goes On"), hard core gangsta rap ("Ambitionz Az A Ridah," "Shorty Wanna Be a Thug"), fun lowrider music ("Thug Passion" with DJ Quik's Talk Box), to the sex anthems ("Ratha Be Ya N---a")all rapped over smooth to hard G-Funk beats sampling Roger and George Clinton Jr. The beats that are sampled are well done. One standout track is "Ain't Hard 2 Find" because the beat is strong, nice smooth G-Funk, and it hosts a variety of Bay Area rappers (Oakland's Richie Rich, Vallejo's D-Shot, E-40, and B-Legit, and Sacramento's C-Bo). Tupac is great lyrically as well, and that is apparent in every track here!

Ssssh, Ten Years After's fourth album (I believe) was released in 1969, one of 2 albums released that year (The other being the interesting Stonedhenge), and this album rocks hard. Alvin Lee goes totally insane on that guitar and lead vocals, and the rest of the band Ric Lee, Chick Churchill, Leo Lyons create a widely varied soundscape that keeps the listener fiending for more. This album seems to be swept under the rug in mentioning considering it was released in 1969, a big year for bands that made it big at the time or earlier, like Led Zeppelin (I and II both that year), The Beatles' Abbey Road, Blind Faith (eponymous), Stones' Let It Bleed among many, many more albums. I believe this album to be a contender for the greats like those considering the raw musical passion infused into this record. As I said, the soundscape is varied. There are many blues-rock songs (which I love), like "Stoned Woman," the Sonny Boy Williamson (and lone) cover "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl," with a crazy extended guitar solo, and the slightly country-blues flavored "Two Time Mama." My favorite song here is the crazy "Bad Scene." At the beginning there is a weird sound effect akin to some kind of animal like a raccoon cooing/whine (???) (I am not a technical audiophile/expert), and it sounds strange, and then a psychedelic guitar explosion then ensues with the energy one becomes accustomed to from Mr. Lee, with trippy vocals. The tempo changes a few times to a few seconds of blues-rock in the middle of the verses, and a guitar solo 3/4 the way throught the song, and I love it. For someone with a short attention span like me, this song keeps me energized. "I Don't Know That You Don't Know My Name" is more acoustic with a slightly psychedelic Middle-Eastern vibe. "The Stomp" is another keyboard ridden blues-rock jam akin to their earliest days, similar in style to some of the music on 1967's debut album, mellow with a slight tinge of jazz. "I Woke Up This Morning" is hard blues-rock with serious guitar work and vocals with as much power as the blues greats. It deals with waking up to see that your gal is long gone and dealing with it. This jam proves that those British blues-rockers can do the blues (and compose like Lee does this song here)as good as the original blues artists of the past. It is sad that this album does not get mentioned as one of the greats because in my opinion, this is some awesome music. This album is a time capsule into the variety of rock 'n roll styles of the end of the 60's, and a perfect example thereof. I highly recommend any TYA album (60's and 70's), and this one especially so.

O.C. comes back and hard on his second set, 1997's Jewelz is another banger full of straight hard-hittin flava produced by the likes of Buckwild, Ogee, Show (of Showbiz and AG), Beatminerz, Lord Finesse, and oh yes, Premier! The beats here are serious: bass heavy boom bap. Again, O.C. shows his versatility on the mic. IMO, the album is nearly equal to Word...Life but for different reasons. Lyrically, Word...Life has the edge, but productionwise, this album has it by a little. Dude got an ill flow and he again flexes it well over the beats. He and Bumpy Knuckles (Freddie Foxxx) get wreck on both dj Premier laced "Win The G" and "M.U.G." The latter has an ill, orchestra influenced beat with swirling melody over a slammin' boom bap beat. Who says hip-hop producers aren't musicians? "Dangerous" features Big L rippin' the mic with harsh flows over a flashy, and poppy beat. It has a little more cross-over appeal than the others, but still is ill. "Far From Yours" shows what happens to cats who try to bite O's style. "It's Only Right" has a more old-school vibe, but still with the sophistication of a new school beat. He shows it is only right that he rock the crowd with his style. The crazy jazzy style of the beat of "You and Yours" by Ogee reminds me of the rawness of Word...Life, and it does have a 1994ish sound to it. O.C. really lays down some ill flows about celebrating life. Jewelz is yet another banger in O.C.'s sparse catalog. Make sure to cop this one before it is out of print and sells for an abominable amount second-hand like the original 1994 pressing of Word...Life often does. O.C. is truly a gifted MC lost among the Jiggy, pop rappers of the late 90's.

Snoop Dogg comes real dope in Y2K with this one. Believe it or not, this is only the second Snoop album I got; I bought Doggfather and the No Limit albums after! This album compared to his late 90's albums, and his ones after this, is one of his best in my humble opinion. He has that passion and great production that make this second to Doggystyle. In fact, this album has an insert comic strip of him awaiting execution by chronic injection, hella funny, and it reminds me heavily of his debut. The beats are awesome and even though they are timely (for 2000 standards), they are awesome. Snoop hooks up with Dr. Dre, Battlecat, Meech Wells, Scott Storch, Soopafly, and these guys all deliver some top-notch G-Funk beats. Timbaland drops some phat mainstream style electrofunk on a couple, and Carlos Stephenson (of No Limit fame) drops an o.k. beat on "Back Up Off Me" which is mediocre, but not bad. Master P, who I do like, esp. in earlier works, drops a funny hook with his grunty vocals. There are many phat tracks that bring back that Long Beach Cali sound, like "True Lies" with a nice laidback keyboard ridden Dre beat and Kokane dropping some dope moany hook vocals (It's dope to see Kokane, Snoop, and Dre working together esp. considering the beef Ruthless records (Kokane was a memeber of) had with Death Row Records (Dre). Kokane drops a bunch more vocals on this album too. Kokane is also on the banger "Hennessey N Buddah" another funky twangy track giving an ode to the drink and weed. I love the C-Walkin' "Wrong Idea" with Bad Azz and Kokane, a nice bouncy hood anthem. Scott Storch drops real heat on "Y'all Gone Miss Me," a vintage G-Funk track with a slow rollin' beat and phat whiny synths that remind me of the early-mid 90's. Scott Storch also creates a dope beat on "Ready 2 Ryde" w/ sexy Eve and Snoop trading g'd up verses over a heavy East Coast meets West Coast inflected thumper. There are some P-Funk inflected tracks too! Scott Storch produces a space boogie beat on the lovably odd pimp anthem "Brake Fluid." Timbaland produces his electrofunk beats on the mainstream tracks like "Set It Off" (w/ Ice Cube, MC Ren, Nate Dogg, and Rage); definitely a party jumper, and Timbo did the same on Snoop Dogg (What's My Name Pt. 2) giving the album a track for the radio and video circuit. Then, there is the "Aqua Boogie" sample, a staple in G-Funk, on the funny, lovable, but odd "I Can't Swim." The beat is not a simple sample; it is given a life of its own! This album is too long to go track by track, but it is definitely worth lookin' into. Dope production and Snoop's best luid flow and lyrics since Doggystyle definitely turned my head and made it nod. This is as close as he has ever gotten to matching the intensity and passion of Doggystyle. In my books, this album is right there with the classics!

1994 definitely brought out the best in artists, and Houston, Texas' Big Mello definitely delivers on his 1994 classic: Wegonefunkwichamind on Rap-A-Lot Records. The vibes and beats on this album are straight up smoked out G-Funk that rival some of my favorite West Coast classics. There is a phat P-Funk inflection on most of the beats, and I wonder if Mello and George Clinton are homies or long lost relatives. Half of the album is produced by Mello, and the other is by Crazy C. "Dat Killa" is a dope self-produced hooter loc'n joint with a chill, sunny beat that reminds me of a mix of my favorite west coast producers like Warren G, Dr. Dre, and DJ Quik all rolled into one! It is easily one of my favorite G-Funk beats! "Wind Me Up" also gives off that magical, sunny vibe reminiscent on the magic of Snoop's Doggystyle album and some of Parliament's or Funkadelic's flava, with some hoodsta lyrics. The end of the album features "Southside" a phat posse joint of underground rapper homies clocking in at 8 minutes! The vibe is harder and more mobbish and gangsta. A dope joint with a disco-inflected beat is "No Hidin Place" with some smoked out vocals and some jazz horns. Intersetingly, the lyrics are gangsta but given off with an easy delivery that is not menacing. It sounds like he rapped the vocals over a phone like Mac Dre and X-Raided did around the same time. The title track features a nice whiny synth and a smoked out sunny beat and fun lyrics. If you think that by reading this that the album is simply a west coast rip-off, you are wrong. Big Mello creates his own vibe, and the beats are simply mezmerizing! Many also do have that deep-southern-fried feel too. Mello and Crazy C really delivered the funk and this album is a G-Funk era masterpiece. I know fans of The Chronic, Doggystyle, Regulate...G Funk Era, and old-school 70's funk and soul will definitely dig this one.

Seagram (R.I.P.), representin' East Oakland, Cali, definitely delivers on his second album, 1994's Reality Check On Rap-A-Lot Records. He is a great lyricist and has a good, loud rapping voice and a good flow to go with that. This cat can spit. Beats are vintage bay area G-Funk, and are relaxing and melodic. Production goes to Seagram, with instrumentation by Troy White, Mike Dean, Mark Anthony, Eaton Fox, and Seag himself. A great summertime cruisin' G-Funk era anthem is "Eastside" with cool layers of keyboard melody. Another one is "Gangstas and Players" (f/ Too Short) both kickin some street oriented, pimp game. The beat is cool Oakland swingin' with a neat whiny synth in the hook. With styles so different, the 2 go well together here. "Gangsta Livin'" is a cool joint where Seag discusses life in the hood without glorifying it. He flows really hard here/ "The Town" (F/ Angie and Gangsta P) is a dark anthem of Oakland. The beat is vintage Rap-A-Lot almost southern style. "13 Deep" has a mega-relaxed, smooth, twangy guitar diff driven G-Funk beat. The lyrics showcase Gangsta P and seag trying to keep their head up living in a crime ridden neighborhood and growing up in the legal system (California Youth Authority). "Birth" definitely rings true. This joint is about loving the children you give birth to and being there for them. The beat is upbeat and melody driven funk. This song definitely touches the heart. It has an Isley Brothers "For The Love Of You" sample. Another deep song is "Where Do We Go From Here" where Seagram analyzes the plight of losing friends and family members and tries to move on. The beat is sunny R and B inflected with a great hook by Suzette. "No Matter The Cost" has a cool G-Funk atmosphere with a sweet and sunny beat perfect to roll to down the avenue to. I would say that this album is as sunny Cali G-Funk era as Warren G and Snoop Dogg with respect to the vibes the beats themselves give off even though the lyrics can be hard core. I love the emotional and lyrical depth Seagram puts into this classic. It is expensive and rare now, but I recommend saving up some extra ends now before it goes for 100 plus dollars. Fans of 2 Pac, Scarface, Big Syke and the like will definitely dig Seagram. Too bad, he had to fall victim to the game. RIP to a real rapper.

Late 1993, Scarface younger brother, 13 year old 2 Low, who has appeared on Scarface's awesome 1993 The World Is Yours, and DMG's 1993 classic Rigormortiz, gets his own and only chance to shine on Rap-A-Lot records. Do not simply expect a radio-friendly album in the vein of Kriss Kross and the like. He is a kid and it shows, but he is also street tough and sometimes reflective. As for production, it is excellent, drawing upon a deep fried G-Funk feel often paired with P-Funk samples and whiny synths. Beats are produced by John Bido, Tony "Big Chief" Randle, and James Smith. "Throw Ya Hands In The Air" is a phat funky party joint with an "Atomic Dog sample. "Da Hood" is harder with Blac Monk's 3-2 stoppin' by and droppin some street ish. "Send Ya Fa Ya Mama" is hot with a P-Funk sample and a sick whiny synth. He ain't playin around here and is menacing for a youngsta. "Class Clown" is appropriately juvenile and funny over an old funk sample, and Devin The Dude supplies the funny hook vocals. "Growing Up Ain't Easy" is what it is, a coming of age joint that is reflective over a sweet G-Funk beat, and Devin again provides the hook vocal. Overall, this album gives a neat perspective of a child growing up in the hoods of 5th Ward Houston paired with excellent beats and samples.

Trinity Garden Cartel hails from Houston, Texas and lays down some reality and controversy on Don't Blame It On Da Music. I read somewhere that the album's cover portrays Houston Police Officers in a negative way, so it caused some tension and heat. These dudes were signed for Priority and Rap-A-Lot for this 1994 banger. Since it is from 1994, expect a great amount of funkiness, and this album has no shortage of it. Michael Banks Darrel Williams, and James Foster produce the music with mixing from the great Mike Dean and Mike Banks. The only problem is that the album sound quality is not the best, perhaps due to the equipment? Now what sets this album apart from other H-Town and Rap-A-Lot albums from Texas is the beats. G-Funk is nothing new in the south in this time frame, and this album has no shortage of it, but this album often has a straight west coast feel, for the beatsmiths often sample P-Funk and George Clinton. "Gangsta Stroll" has elements sampled from "Aqua Boogie" and "Atomic Dog" and has a straight L.A. feel to it similar to South Central Cartel songs from the same year on their N Gatz We Truss album! "Gank Town" and "Play Lil Funky" also have a similar vibe, and the title track has a whiny synth over a slick mainy beat. Lyricwise, the album is straight hard core gangster flows. "The Ghetto My Hood (remix)" is deeper over a more southern twangy beat. "Fire It Up" is the hooter joint, nice and laidback, and yes, funky! The rider anthem, "Gangsta Stroll" is perfect to bend corners to. "Rollin' Deep" is definitely more southern sounding with that rattling beat and twangy guitar funk. All in all, a dope gangsta rap album, not groundbreaking lyrically, but not lame or played out either. The beats and production are dope.

Geto Boys alum Willie D came out with an interesting album in 1994: Play Witcha Mama. Produced by Derek "Grizz" Edwards, Crazy C, and many co prod. by D himself, the beats are sick. They range from hard mobbin, to southern fried funk, to smooth G-Funk. If you dig the political and social commentary of Ice Cube and the rawness and violent and sexual explicitness of Eazy-E, this album is for you. In fact, Ice Cube guest stars on the title track and the 2 have hella tight chemistry. I am not crazy about raunchy sex rap, but the beats of "Throat" and "Something Good" are sick, so even though the raps are explicity nasty, the beats slap with that laid back G-Funk heads from the south and west will roll to. I love the sophisticated G-Funk beats of "Creepin,'" "Whatcha Know About That," "Smoke 'M" and "Is It Real (My Mind Still Playin' Tricks On Me)." As for the lyrics, D does a hella good job touching on social and political issues like welfare, gang violence, and social problems in "N----s Are Dyin'" problems with the church "Guess My Religion." He gets gangsta on bangers like "Recipe 4 A Murder," "Smoke 'M," among others. He gets your tears goin on "Is It Real" beccause he brings up him imagining himself being with his beloved grandmother and family; then, he realizes he's at the cemetery looking at their tombstones, another installment in the Mind Playin Tricks epic (1) Geto Boys original, (2) Scarface's version, (3) Willie's. All in all, this album is a nice underappreciated gem from H-Town.

1994, Memphis' Gangsta Pat drops Sex, Money & Murder. I believe Pat is a former homie of 3-6 mafia (I know little about Gangsta Pat and his history with 3-6). He drops a crazy, maniacal album full of terror and hot-headedness. I love good gangsta rap albums, and this is one for sure. The production is held by Pat and Patrick "Too Big" Hall, and the beats definitely had that early pre-crunk vibe, raw and heavy, even though the music sound is low probably due to the equipment. This guy drops heavy madness in joints like "Homicidal Lifestyle" with a more melodic keyboard driven beat, a little lighter beatwise compared to joints like the heavier and twangier "Real G's Don't Die." He gets on the marks who think they can take him down in "Can't Mess Wit Me" with a heavier southern-fried beat with jingle bells in the background. Pat gets a little more romantic and sensual in "Gangsta Luv" with a little more of a laidback, slower vibe, a nice cut to chill to with ya boo. On the other end, he gets on a woman he sees as a trick real hard in "That Girl" and verbally tears her down, not as nice(I am not real crazy of women demeaning songs as many rappers do), but the beat is cool. "The Saga Continues" is a crunk type jam with dope scratches and some angry spits. "Shootin' At Narcs (Part II) is a hot-headed bouncy crunk joint. "Natural High" is a coming of age hustler joint with a hook interpolating Curtis Mayfield and how the money he stacks gets him some of the things he never had before. Now, this album is not groundbreaking lyrically, but it is a neat gangsta album by a hard MC who holds nathan back and who has a "I don't give a ---- attitude." The prodction on this album is an early indication of the development of crunk with phat, raw beats, and when crunk was not overblown and overly commercialized as it often is now.

Flint, Michigans's MC Breed comes back right after 1994's Funkafied with another one- Big Baller. This album is funky like the last one, but in a different vein. When I bought it, I expected some more deep fried funk like his last one The last one had a G-Funk (down south, west coast) feel to it; this one has a little more East Coast vibe, which is cool because Breed can adapt well to it, even though there is some G-Funk here too. The beat and vibe on "Real MC" is serious; the beat is hella hot and Breed lays down some slick flows; it is one that has a mesh between Down South and East Coast beats. "Sea Of Bud" is the loc'n joint with Too Short and Jibri; it has a G-Funk feel to it and is nice to ride to or to chill to. "You Slippin'" has an East Coast beat in the vein of Erick Sermon or The Roots, very jazzy, a neat battle rap collabo with Mighty Joe Riz. "What Do You Get" is mad funky with a mob style gangster hook and nice funky somewhat southern or west coast beat. Another East Coast vibin' song is "Game For Life" with dope scratches and decent flow from Breed. This album is tight, and I highly recommend it, but Funkafied is even better. Also, check out DFC's 1994 thumper Things In Tha Hood for more of that unfadeable Flint Michigan Playalistics and Gangsterism!

Finally this long awaited album has been released, the first UGK collective since 2001's Dirty Money, and like that album, it was delayed for quite a while and pushed back. Dirty Money was hot, but I think this one may even be better, dare I say it. The whole 2 disc set features UGK stickin to the script lyrically, good rider anthems, fun pimpin joints(unlike the played out dry ones that plague the airways today), some good gangsta tracks, and some deeper tracks over high quality production (for the most part). The producers include, Pimp C on a big chunk, N.O. Joe, 3-6's Juicy J and DJ Paul, Scarface, Jazze Pha, Lil Jon, and a myriad of lesser knowns, and even though the album is in step with the times, for many of the songs have a mainstream crunk and bounce beats, others pay hommage to the old-school ways. There are some smooth funky joints that reminisce of the UGK of the 90's, many of which were produced by N.O. Joe, Pimp C and Scarface. There is more of a mainstream feel lyrically on many; guests include, Too Short, OutKast, Dizzee Rascal, Slim Thug and a few others. I will say, more mainstream or not, I love the vibe of this album. Too Short and UGK remake Short's Life Is...Too Short in "Life Is 2009," with a similar beat to the original, but with more twang and bounce. Marley Marl produces a funky beat with Big daddy Kane and Kool G Rap dropping some old school style rhymes on "Next Up." Juicy J and DJ Paul create a Crunk-soul atmosphere on the relaxed banger "Int'l Players Anthem (I Choose You)." UGK exclaim why they have the streets sowed on "The Game Belongs To Me" with a smooth Texas Swang N Bang beat. N.O. Joe creates a slow rollin and twangy beat on "Cocaine", and Pimp C discusses how he was maintaining until Cocaine entered his life; Bun B drops some knowledge and history about it, while Rick Ross hustles it. UGK and Willie D pump up the south and explain why it rules, and if you don't like it, tough; the South is on hit, and is here to stay. "Shattered Dreams" is another smooth joint by Pimp C with some deeper life philosophy, dropping serious knowledge. We have the obligatory funky fun rider anthems like "Candy," produced by Scarface, which are for the six-fo's. Some mediocre mainstream crunk joints like the Lil Jon produced "like That" and like "Hit The Block" with T.I. with a weaker Swizz Beatz beat are too mainstream for me. Even if they are not for you like it they are not for me, do not let joints like those deter you because the other joints are phat. Overall, the filler is not enough to overpower the good ones. This album is definitely a UGK album, and the beats and lyrics are vintage UGK, and remind you why THEY are the kings of Texas, the south, and the underground, and hopefully, they will rule the mainstream!!! Pimp C's and Bun B's flows aer in tact, and they never fell off in my opinion. I hope this album sells at least 5X platinum! This album is a fitting album and what the mainstream needs, some trillness! Let's hope we don't heve to wait until 2012 or 2013 for the next album. Maybe they will hook up with Rap-A-Lot, who won't screw them over, and release an album sooner with as much ambition and fire as this one.

The Ill Mannered Posse comes back 4 the 9-6 season with a heater! The album is loaded with ill rhymes from Cougnut 'n C Fresh. Musically, the album ranges from laid back G-Funk to hard core gangster. The track "Shinin' Star" is the top joint; it has a nice relaxin' beat and rhythm. It brings to mind, a gorgeous sunny Cali day ridin with the top down hittin switches. "The Bay Way" is a fun bouncy track spittin game about the yay. "The Last Breath" is a G-Funk classic with a melodic but somber beat reminiscing on a homie that died due to violence, and how revenge is carried out. "Wild Ass West" is also dope, with a menacing bass, and a eerie keyboard synth. Make sure to peep this album; it's full of west coastin' game.

1996 DJ Screw releases a second installment of his classic series: 3 'N The Mornin' and screws some of the classic southside joints from the mid 90's. He screws classics from Botany Boyz, Point Blankk, Al-D, E.S.G., and others. He even takes Mack 10's spits from "Foe Life" and puts them on his own "Foe Life" over an Al-D "Lost In Tha Hood" beat from Al's debut album Home Of The Free. I love the slowed and throwed version of "Cloverland" (Botany Boyz), and I love the added twangy guitar riff and keyboards. Screw will sometimes mix different beats together like here, and it works because the different samples go together well. Sometimes, the beat from one leads into the following joint, like the beat from that Al-D sample leading from "No Way Out" to "Foe Life" and to "Servin A Duce," but it never gets old because he adds more samples to the mixture. He is a master DJ and he can scratch and mix with the best of them. I also love the slowed version of E.S.G.'s laidback G-Funk rider anthem "G-Ride" and gives it that syrupy lean feel. There is even a sample of an Ant Banks beat mixed with E.S.G.'s beat and lyrics on "Sailin' Da South." The Ant Banks beat is from Spice 1's Face Of A Desparate Man" from 1994. DJ Screw definitely had a following in H-Town and he still lives on in fame. Paul Wall, Lil Keke, Mike Jones often have screwed samples in their songs, and chopped and screwed versions of their albums. I slept on him for a long time, especially being a west coast native, and I finally woke up to this man's great legacy. R.I.P. playa!

Scarface comes as hard as ever on his 3rd solo. First off the beats, ranging from deep syrupy G-Funk, to steady, hard mobbin' produced by N.O. Joe, Mike Dean, Uncle Eddie, and Face himself bring to mind the magic of mid 90's gangsta rap in the tradition of Dr. Dre, Sam Sneed, Ice Cube, and many others. Face's hard rapping voice, and relentless flows are enganging. There are two hella short but slammin' G-Funk tracks that standout because of their beats and ferocity: "No Tears" and "The Diary." In fact, these are among my favorite Scarface tracks, brecause they are to the point and are not too long and drawn out. "Hand Of The Dead Body" is a hard core classic collabo between Ice Cube, Face, and Devin that touches on politics, and who the OG's in the game are. There is a neat remake of the Geto Boy's classic 1991 hit "Mind Playin Tricks On Me." I love the beat to it, perfect for a top down ride. "G's" is smokin, over a smooth but hard G-Funk beat, with a funky, faint, twangy guitar riff in each verse. All in all, Face's album slams all the way thru.

Daz and Kurupt make up the legendary Long Beach duo Tha Dogg Pound. 1995 was the year they dropped the album that further changed the game that The Chronic and Doggystyle did the 3 years before. The production on this album is 2nd to none and handled by mostly Daz himself (DJ Pooh, Soopafly, and Dre add some mixing and production as well), one of the best producers in the game. This album is some of the finest examples of G-Funk ever conceived. The sad thing, is that it took some time for it to grow on me before I was a more serious rap head like I am now. But I now recognize fully that this album is a masterpiece. My favorite jam is "I Don't Wanna Dream About Gettin' Paid" where Daz and Kurupt tell stories about trying to make it. Daz' verse is the best because he paints a nice picture about ditching a loser job to follow the drug trade to make faster scrilla. The beat is laidback, melodic, and soulful with Nate Dogg providing a nice backdrop in the hook. Daz and Kurupt can battle rap very well, a style often associated with East Coast rap. They do so against the Ruthless Camp on "Dogg Pound Gangstaz" over a hard mobbin beat. "Cyco-Lic-No" has one of the deepest and smoothest beats that are loud enough to blow ya speakers; just listen to the bass! "Reality" kicks in some trillness by DPG over another beautiful Long Beach style banger beat. "One By One" is another classic with an airy beat with both kicking serious flows. They battle rhyme with precision. Kurupt has a sick and fluid flow; he can flow complex, yet make it sound so easy. This album is a total testament of the Death Row legacy; better yet, it is a testment to the Long Beach rap legacy. Don't sleep. This album is the definition of G-Funk and why the sub-genre is so great.

JT The Bigga Figga, a local San Francisco celebrity, and bay area rap entrepreneur comes out with what I believe his second album in late 1993 Playaz N The Game under Priority Records and his own label: Get Low. This album is chock full of hard gangsterism and hustlenomics. I like JT's rapping style and flow, and his dedication to great rap music. This album is mostly produced by him, and his beats are phat. His beats here stand out more for me than other 1993 West Coast artists' albums because many of them seem a bit ahead of their time (more like 1994 or 1995 style beats, which are my favorites). The style is Mobb Music, which takes heavy cues from G-Funk. "Peep Game" is where he flamboasts and hustles, and the beat is nice keyboard and dj scratch ridden G-funk, a perfect lowrider jam. Mac Mall comes in and spits fire as usual on "Game Recognize Game." Rappin' 4-Tay comes in on the hooter joint "Did You Get The Dank." A few hooks are weak and overly repetitive like on the two aforementioned, but to me that is minimally improtant compared to the hard rhymes and great beats. "Foul From The Start" or as noted on Amazon "Youngsters" (track 10) is a coming of age story in the hood with a neat whiny synth and bouncy lowrider beat. Overall, this album is a dope standard setter in Frisco and Bay Mobb Music, where a lot of influence came from in the mid 90's in terms of style and substance. If you like this, check I.M.P's 1993 Back In The Day, 4-Tay's 1994 Don't Fight The Feelin' for more of that mobb madness.

San Quinn, a homie of bay rap entrepreneur, JT The Bigga Figga, and member of his crew, The Get Low Playas, drops what I believe is his 2nd solo album: 1996's The Hustle Continues. Let me tell you, this cat can flow. He flows fluidly over the bouncy mobb'n beats which often interpolate the G-Funk sound and tailored for the bay area rap scene. JT The Bigga Figga handles most of the production, with a few exceptions, and does it well. I dig the joint "No Glory." Quinn drops some street knowledge over a nice keyboard ridden G-Funk melody. The beat is laidback and sweet. He also rises above the negativity in "Overcoming Confrontations" with another laidback scorcher beat. San Quinn gets his grind on in the bouncy banger "The Hustle Continues" over a phat T-Super beat. "Mob Style Musik," is what it is, Frisco Mobb Music (Frisco's common sound: bouncy beats similar to G-Funk but harder), another banger! "Shock The Party" is another banger with a bouncy beat, perfect to get the party crunk. "Hitz I'm Makin" samples HIPS by Mtume, and is decent but not necessary. Overall, this album is a great representative of the Frisco Street Hustler mentality that JT The Bigga Figga pioneered. JT did great by signing this cat up. He spits fire over already hot beats.

For a G-Funk fan like me, you'd expect that this was my first rap cd. To be honest, I was exposed to Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle much earlier than this one. This one came out a few years before I even started listening to rap, and I was quite young. I even heard 2001 before this one! When I heard this one finally, it hit me hard. I couldn't believe that I had slept on this one. Dr. Dre has a way of flipping those P-Funk and soul samples, some of them from love songs, and turning them to West Coast gangsta anthems that still prove relevant today. Many of the beats were ahead of their time, and it is easy to see where so many rappers and producers got their ideas from for their own albums. Every song is delicately crafted and well tailored. The lyrics are dope, but I believe that the chemistry between Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dre that makes this album worthy besides the beautiful beats. Now, there is a debate between the origins of G-Funk. Many schools of thought believe Cold 187um from Above The Law started the sub-genre with their early 90's albums, for the sound is evident on and Black Mafia Life from 1993 (another classic). That album was made and finished in 1992 like The Chronic, but wasn't released until February 1993. That train of thought states that Dre took the sound from 187 and made it his own. The other school says that Dre started it himself, and 187 was influenced by it, and these disagreements between both parties helped further a long lasting beef between Dre (Death Row) and Ruthless Records (Above The Law). Who started it remains to be a question. However, the funk here is awesome and sounds organic and original. "Nuthin' But A "G" Thang" is a staple of G-Funk, and I still hear it in car stereos (including mine) today; the sweet twangy leon Haywood sample is awesome and relaxing. "Little Ghetto Boy" has a smooth, relaxing beat and is lyrically dope. There are harder tracks too. "The Day The N---az Took Over" has a crazy beat, and the lyrics are inspired by the Riots of 1992, and are still politically relevant today. "Lyrical Gangbang" has no Dre (as a few don't too) hits real hard with a bass beat, and Rage, Kurupt, and RBX kill the track with vicious flows. That joint also features the whiny synth Dre is well known for . Whiny keyboard synths already existed before in a few joints, but Dre poplarized them out west, and even sown south and midwest producers incorporated them into thir beats. The intro and "F--- Wit Dre Day" get hard on Eazy-E, Tim Dog, and Ruthless Records. Dre even gets at Ruthless on the bonus "B----es Ain't S---" where the other verses by Daz and Snoop go women bashing and on sexcapades. Overall, this album, along with Above The Law's Black Mafia Life and DJ Quik's Quik Is The Name ushered in a new era, The G-Funk Era. This one happened to bubble the most. Do not sleep on this classic. At least, a great album that got the sales it deserved and a respectable chart position.

The Delinquents brought serious heat to the table in 1997's Big Moves. It's hard to believe that I am the first to review this album, since it is awesome, and it is 2006, 9 years after it was released. These cats come correct with hard and firey flows with tight guests like Richie Rich, Bart, Agerman, Harm, among others. Interestingly, the album starts off with a bang with hard knockers "Puttin It Down'" and "We Bring Drama" and ends on the laid back tip with "Big Licks" and "Let Me Touch It." My personal favorite is "Big Licks," which is the album version of the single released early 1996. The beat is simply immaculate. It is a nice smooth, flossy, keyboard heavy G-Funk selection that brings to mind the magic of G-Funk classics like Warren G's "Regulate" or "This DJ," 3X Krazy's "Keep It On The Real," or Suga Free's "Doe Doe and a Skunk." The song is about flossin and hustlin, perfect for a house party. "Sounds Like?" is another dope but dirty track, with a bouncy beat. The West Coast and Oaktown anthem gives love to the town and shows the harder side of Oakland life in "East Oakland, West Coast" over a hard beat. All in all, this album is smokin;' west coast rap fans need to have this!

Mack 10 drops his second album in late 1997, and it is an underrated classic with great G-Funk production and sick spits by Mack 10. Beat credits go to Ant Banks on 1/4th of the whole album (his beats simply bang here as usual!), Binky (of Allfrumthai), Tray, Soopafly, Ice Cube, Bob Cat, all do a song or two. I like the beats here better than on his self-titled debut, and those beats ranged from o.k. to a few classics. Mack 10 gets his brag on in the adrenaline paced "Mack 10, Mack 10." E-40 and Mack get they hustle on in the deep-groove Ant Banks laced banger "Can't Stop." They flow well, and even though they have different styles, they complement each other and have dope chemistry. "Only In California" f/ Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube is a simply bangin' lowrider classic with slick spits (especially Snoop's verse). Cruise to this on the palm lined avenues on 3-wheel motion. "W/S Foe Life" is a brief, more menacing banger with a loud whiny synth in the hook. "Backyard Boogie" is a certified classic with a sweet funky beat and imagery of chillin at the BBQ with hunnies and homies. I love the loopy, whiny synth that gives it a slight space boogie feel in the hook. Mack 10 and gets his mash on in "Tonight's The Night" with a unique and slumpin Ant Banks banger beat. Banks reworks the beat on the phat remake of NWA's "Dopeman," and Mack 10 does a good job interpolating it, and adds in a few of his own lyrics here and there. The beat on "The Guppies" is slightly awkward, but very original; it is fast and pulsating, and Ice Cube comes by to represent. I love "What You Need (Dopeman '97)." He pushes dope and shows his wide variety of "retail" on the laidback, sunny G-Funk banger, perhaps his own original version of "Dopeman." All in all, this album is full of bangers throughout, and the production is awesome and really gives him a good backdrop to spit. If you liked his debut, you may like this one better.

Ant Banks comes up with his 4th "album." The thing is, he does not really rap, but he produces all the tracks. His beats are so awesome, they make classics alone. He takes G-Funk to another level. Another thing, Ant Banks beats fit all the rappers' styles ranging from the bay's 4-Tay, E-40, Too $hort, all the way down to the L.A. area's heavy hittas CJ Mac, Mack 10, WC, Allfrumtha I, Ice Cube. My favorite 2 tracks are "4 Tha Hustlas" (Too $hort, 2Pac, and MC Breed. The beat is so syrupy, and the twangy and rock and roll guitar riffs add seasoning; it is easily one of Banksta's best beats ever. And the other is "Hard Knox" with WC and J-Dubb. Banks laces them up with a mobb-style-yet-funky beat, and J-Dubb and WC kill the track with harsh, relentless flows. It's too bad the beat on the intro was not a beat of an actual song, because it would have made a classic fo real. It would have been nice to cut the interludes and include Ant Banks rapping, but it is undeniable, even though, he does not rap, he is the star!! Don't get me wrong, the rappers do an awesome job too.

Blue Magic does good on the third album, Thirteen Blue Magic Lane from 1975 following 1974's classic self-titled album and equally classic Magic Of The Blue also from 1974. Teddy Mills still hits them high tenor notes again. This time around, the album's motif seems to touch upon Halloween. The songs centered around Halloween topics and imagery are also the neater ones here. On the slow jam "Born On Halloween," the love interest was born on 10/31 and seems to have a spell over him, and on another slow burner,"Haunted by Your Love" discusses a strong love for a woman again using references to Halloween hauntings. The opener is a sad jam about a lonely man living alone. This jam is beautiful, if not heartbreaking, and opens the album with a classic slower mid-tempo jam with fantastic harmony, nice and poetic. We get an uptempo jam more appropriate for dance and pop crossover, "We're On The Right Track Now" with great harmony, a neat change of pace from the slow jams and ghostly references on side A. "Stop And Get A Hold Of Yourself" is slower and keyboard synth driven during the verses, and then there are faster and funkier hooks with a gruff vocal. "Magic Of The Blue" ia another faster danceable jam on side B, a disco type funker. Although the first 2 albums to me were a bit better, it was nice to see Blue Magic experiment with the Halloween imagery and incorporate it into love songs, a nice original idea. How well it fits depends on the individual listener. I like how they vary the pace from one side to the other here, delivering a solid album with variety, soul, dance, and some funk.

Roger's 1987 album, "Unlimited," has some great funky flava along with some classic R&B and pop tracks. The song "I Want to Be Your Man," is awesome; it is sweet, passionate, and believable,laced with Roger's talkbox. "Thrill Seekers" is a daring and fun track with a bumpin old-school funky pop beat. "If You're Serious" is a nice slower tempo song with great singing and a relaxing, romantic beat. There is no song that can match the classic song "Computer Love," from 2 years before on "The New Zapp IV U", but this album is a testament to Roger's genius work. I love rap a lot, but this is a nice alternative for when I am in a different mood!!

I may not be big on mainstream albums because I mainly listen to under the radar stuff, but I gotta say, Ludacris is a dope MC. This dude can flow relentlessly over those bouncy beats. His one liners make u laugh so hard it will hurt ya stomach! He can get hard core and hot headed in tracks like "Catch Up" "1st And 10," but he still throws in funny lines like "Did I do dat, or was it Mystikal and Urkel?"!! He even calls himself "Slick D--- the Ruler, women in need!" He can get raunchy like that, but no matter what, his delivery is hilarious!! I luv "Southern Hospality;" I first didn't like it when I heard it in 2000, but I warmed up to it and rocked it constantly. It is fun and bouny over a Neptunes scorcher beat. Do I think it is a classic? Yes, Ludacris is what the hip hop industry needs, some well-deserved humor. His non-stop flows with his homies from DTP put it down 4 ATL. Nice production, sick flows and funny rhymes!!!

Mausberg comes nothing short of bumpin' on his only solo album. Unfortunately he did not live to see it be released, being killed in Compton months before its release. Just about all the beats (many courtesy of the funky dope brotha Q.U.I.K) on this album slam. His beats are the ones that remind you of what made you fall in love with that West Coast G-Funk years before! His album is fun, naughty, deep, hard core, and playerish all rolled into one. In fact, this album is one of the best albums to come out of Quik's camp. Excellent production, awesome rhymes from the Realest himself really help put the West back on the map for the new millenium. Most of his guests are from Quik's camp of course: AMG, 220, Quik, Playa Hamm, Suga Free, and so forth. Make sure not to sleep on this classic!!!

Keep It On The Real has 2 singles (both in song and instrumental) from The album Stackin Chips. The radio edit for "Keep It On The Real" is a G-Funk Classic, perfect for ridin' down the avenue, music steady on blast; the only thing is the cuss words are cut out for radio play, but the song is still hella sick. The other single is "Can't F--- With This" with Harm, Pleasure, and the OG Seagram R.I.P. The beat is seriously menacing, and the rhyming is stone cold, a gangsta rap classic. If you dig this, you definitely will find much more of the goodies on Stackin Chips.

In late 1993, Ice Cube releases his 4th full length album (5th if you count Kill At Will EP). He still has some heat in his often angry social and political lyrics. But, he does chill a litle more, as do the beats. Beatwise, this is my favorite Cube album. Sir Jinx, Laylaw (Above the Law), QD III, Madness 4 Real, 88X Unit, and Brian G lace cube up with some smokin' G-Funk beats. His previous albums had some funky beats that were more pre g-funk and more raw, while these are more polished. QD III laced "You Know How We Do It" is one of my favorite g-funk songs of all time. The beat is sunny and laidback with a touch of soul, and there is a piercing whiny synth making the joint a great one to roll to. Cube's rhymes add to the relaxed effect of this classic. "Ghetto Bird" is a pulsating joint where Cube flees the cops, ducks the police chopper, jacks someone's ride, and goes to his woman's house and digs her out. The beat is bouncy with another whiny synth. "Make It Ruff, Make It Smooth" (f/ K-Dee) is a raucous good time. Cube is the ruff loc, and K-Dee is the smooth mack over a bouncy, twangy lowrider beat. "When I Get To Heaven" is a little more controversial. He discusses the corruptness and emptiness of the church declaring it "nuthin' but a fashion show." He knocks on religion. Take it how you want you to. The beat is chill and twangy and has a cool vibe with a flute in the hook. "Lil A-- Gee" is a tale of a younster growin' up fast and causin' trouble and panic mad young. "Cave B----" is an angry, controversial, and somewhat humorous knock on white women and how Ice Cube wants nothing to do with them. The beat has a little more East Coast bump to it and sounds dope in the system. Then we have the full album version of "Bop Gun(One Nation)," a p-funk meets g-funk classic with George Clinton adding his gruff vocals and Ice Cube gettin' it crunk, a dope g-party jam. This version is 11 minutes long! The beat "Enemy" has the early Ice Cube vibe to it with angry lyrics and an old-school beat sounding circa Death Certificate. Ice Cube still uses the c-word towards white folks like on the older albums here. This is the 2003 re-release, and there are 4 bonus tracks- mixes for "What Can I Do" (Westside Mix, and Eastside Mix), the former a lowrider ready bouncer, and the latter a jazzy a-la-Tribe Called Quest, QD III's awesome remix for "You Know How We Do It," and N.O. Joe's Eerie Gumbo Funk mix for "Lil' A-- Gee," and his version has that Texas Mobb style he is known for and a sick whiny synth. As for the album, I feel it's a classic for anyone lovin' gangsta rap, G-Funk, controversial and social aware rap because it caters to all those milieu.

Lil 1/2 Dead went all out in 1994 with his debut The Dead Has Arisen. This one and his 1996 album "Steel On A Mission" are rare and sell for 40-50 dollars. The cost for me to get this one was 41 bucks. It was more than worth it. As a huge G-Funk fan, this one fulfilled all my expectations and then some. The production was top notch and the beats bang!!! Tracy Kendrick handles most production along with extra by Dj Silk, Clever, K Phlx, mong a few others, and they lace HD up with some fire on wax. HD is a tight rapper with a laconic flow and smooth delivery. I love the smothness of "Had To Be A Hustler", which recalls mashing and slanging and banging to survive coming up in Long Beach over a bella Long Beach type beat!! The bangers "Eastside Westside," and "That's What You Get" employ sick, Dr. Dre influenced whiny synthesizers along with some sick gangsta flows from Half Dead. "Still On A Mission" is awesome; I love the old school rawness of the foreground beat, and the smooth relaxing keyboards in the background, and the erie ghostly extra keyboards recall "Getto Jam" by Domino. The other tracks are awesome as well. I recommend saving up extra money, bacause it is well worth the high cost!!!!!

Late 1994, Ice Cube releases a collection of songs and remixes on Bootlegs and B-Sides. Many songs are not on any of his original albums, and several are remixes of joints from 1992's The Predator and 1993's Lethal Injection, and most of them are fire. The only one I don't like is the remix for "It Was A Good Day" because the beat was lacking for some reason the magic that the original had. The 1994 remix for "You Know How We Do It" remixed by Cube himself (originally produced by legend QD3) is just as slammin and has a slightly different G-Funk beat and loses ther potent, loud whiny synth of the original and replaces it with a much softer one in the hook. The remix to 1993's "When I Get To Heaven" is bouncier and funkier than the smooth original, is remixed QD3, and has a good deep groove to it. I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers sample in "You Ain't Gonna Take My Life" which is another dope gangsta boogie beat dealing with crooked and violent cops. "Robbin' Hood (Cause It Ain't All Good)" may have a humorous title, but is serious and adrenaline paced with a neat funky beat and whiny keyboard loop. "Chack Ya' Self (Remix)" features boom bap legends Das EFX over a bouncy funk sample and features cool battle raps by Cube. Das only appears in the hooks unfortunately, but still a dope old-school inflected jammer for the lowrider. I love the cool, bouncy remix to "What Can I Do" perfect L.A. soundtrack music. "Can't F--- Wit These" is an unreleased 1993 pre-g-funk banger with heated lyrics he is famous for. At the end, there is a cool mega-mix sampler of many of Cube's classics giving 30 about seconds of songs like "Ghetto Bird" (1993), "Who's The Mack" 1990, "Wicked" (1992), "You Know How We Do It" 1993 that mix in and lead in from one another smoothly, a fitting tribute to Cube's already legendary status. This may not be an album per-se, but definitely represents Ice Cube as a legend in the rap game and has some classic jams and remixes.

Ice Cube's soundtrack to accompany the 1995 movie is a well-balanced mix of gangsta rap, g-funk, and cool R&B (some of it old-school soul). Dr. Dre's "Keep Their Heads Ringin'" is an all around fun time classic that got constant rotation in my native Southern Cali in spring of 1995. The beat is some sick deep-groove funk produced by Sam Sneed, a sick g-funk producer from Pittsburgh, Pa. Ice Cube'e "Friday" is a classic house party joint with a flamboyant lowrider beat. We also get Rick James 1978 classic, the laidback and soulful weed ode, "Mary Jane," a song sampled 1000 times (or more) for rap joints. We also get some Miami booty bass on ther raunchy "Hoochie Mama." We also get to sample some sweet Rose Royce, the soul packed "I Wanna Get Next To You," a cool jam with sophistication. Roger, from Zapp, kicks in his slick talkbox in "I Heard It Through the Grapevine." Cypress Hill lights up a spliff on the raw underground boom-bap vibin' "Roll it Up, Light It Up, Smoke It Up." E-A-Ski kicks in some deadly verses on "Blast If I Have To" with him and CMT producing a menacing, loud G-Funk beat. The Isley Brothers get it new school on the cool, swingin hood livin' anthem "Trying To See Another Day," and Ronnie Isley still has that dope, tenor voice that made so many hits decades before. The beat is guitar driven and deep-groovin' New Jack style; at times, it sounds like a rock beat. One of my favorite joints is Scarface and Mad CJ Mac's party starter "Friday Night," over a deep-twangy, Texas style G-Funk lowrider ready beat by N.O. Joe perfect to roll ya 64 down I-10 from L.A. to Houston. The rest of the songs ranging from the Alkaholiks, to Bootsy Collins, to Mack 10 all bang and bridge the gap between the old-school and newer school and display different styles of music.

Houston's E.S.G.came thru with a 1995 album, Sailin' Da South, one of those few albums you can listen to through without skipping, a feat hard for many of my other favorites, even other classics, where I skip a song or two. First, ESG hits you with sick and serious flows throughout; he gets your tears jerkin on "Crooked Streets" and "R.I.P." where he reminisces on homies that didn't make it. He also gets upbeat on tracks like "Let 'Em Know," "G-Ride." Beatwise, the beats are among some of the best 3rd coast, and hip-hop period. Producers Sean "Solo" Jemison and Jermaine "Mr.Optimo" Chretien lace up melodic G-Funk beats that'll get ya head noddin for a short but sweet 50 minutes. Beats like "187 Skillz" and "Beauty and the Beast" are hard and menacing. But for the most part, the beats are musically beautiful, combining west coast whiny synths with laid back, sunny, slower, and at times, twangy, Texas beats. Listen to the beats on "Baller Of The Year," "R.I.P.," "For All The G's," among most others to see what I'm sayin'. Don't forget the original and screwed versions of "Swangin and Bangin," a perfect southern anthem over a gorgeous, melodic southern beat. This album slams all the way thru. E.S.G. shoulda got mad more dap for Sailin' Da South! Being primarily a West Coast rap fan, I dig this album more than a majority of those albums; that is how awesome this one is.

Long Beach has a history of being the breeding ground of top-notch rap and hip hop. Rappers from Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg, Twinz, Domino, Foesum, Dove Shack, and many many more have made big strides in underground and mainstream rap. The Long Beach scene helped make G-Funk popular in the mid '90's with Warren G's regulate. 1996 has had its moments, like with "Steel On A Mission." Lil Half Dead kills the tracks with killa flows over dope beats. Using many of the same producers (K Phix, Tracy Kendrick, Courtney Branch, etc) from his 1st album, 1994's The Dead Has Arisen (check that review too), one of the best rap albums of all time, Half Dead comes correct with some nice, heavy G-Funk beats. The album is only 10 songs deep, but it holds its own. "Steel On A Mission '96" is a dope follow up to 1994's "Still On A Mission" with a melodic, twangy, bouncy beat. "Southern Girl" is tight; Hald Dead gets sexual in the song, but he also shows respect for her, and that is refreshing. The beat is hard and bouncy with a nice whiny synth. "Back In The Day" takes a step back to younger days with a whiny synth. "Gotta Git Cha" took a bit of time to grow on me, but now I like to rock it. It steps up the hard core factor with a hard mobbin' beat. "Cavvy Sounds" is a prime example of Long Beach rap, with a dope party style LBC beat, a nice bit of flava for a house party. Lil HD also lets it be known in "If You Don't Know" with arguably, the best beat on the record. "Still Rollin" is a hot one with an eerie keyboard riff in the beat and an airy whiny synth. This album is a dope example of how good G-Funk production can be, and HD's laconic but versatile flow fits the beats well. However, 1994's Dead Has Arisen is a much better album, and that says a lot because this album deserves possible classic status. This one now goes for more than 100 bucks (as of 4/24/07); it's that rare!!

Bigga Figga does what he has to do to strive. He is a vet in the rap game, and hustled his way from the bottom to the top. Dwellin' In Tha Labb is full of hustler anthems and reppin' for the biggidy bay. He handles the general production on the album; the beats range from hard core savage ("Beware Of Those," "Root Of All Evil") to smooth G-Funk ("The Mack Hand," "It's Going Down"), and bouncy ("Ain't Something Wrong"). JT The Bigga Figga represents all ideals of independent hustle, and this album is testament to it. The album is tight, and there are a few surefire classics, like the slick "It's Goin Down" which demonstrates his hustler mentality and optimistically trying to succeed. "Bay Area Playas" is sick because JT gets major figures fromm the yay like Master P, Mac Mall, Pizzo, Link Crew, Seff The Gaffla, among many others to hold it down for the area. "The Mack Hand" is a faint keyboard driven laid back beat paired with JT's killa flow perfect to hit the streets in your SS or Caddy.

1995, Master P did a great job gettin homies from all over the south, mostly from New Orleans and Houston, who all deliver A-1 performances over extremely well-produced beats by various beatsmiths from the south. The beats are awesome, great southern fried flava and a heavy dose of G-Funk. Eightball and MJG mobb out in the hard edged west coast vibin' "F' Dem N" produced by Smoke 1 Prod. The Dayton Family from Flint, Mi come south to kick some gangsterism on "Stick N Move," a hard joint from their 1996 album F.B.I. Master P, Gangsta T, Silkk, and King George be settin the party mood in the bouncy crunk joint "Bounce That A--" with a heavy bass beat. There are a couple of joints featuring the No Limit homies that will get your tears jerking. R.I.P. has a slow and gloomy, but melodic atmosphere with Master P, CCG, and Silk all remimniscing over fallen soldiers over a beautiful beat. "So Much Pain" is another sad G-Funker with P, Tre-8, Mia X. C-Loc, a New Orleans legend strikes fear in the whiny synth laden "Who Am I?" E.S.G., from Houston, serves you a phat Southern rider anthem "The South" from his 1994 classic album Ocean Of Funk. The joint has an Aqua Boogie sample and is perfect to lowride to. A creepy, woozy joint is "Murder Weapon" by Hounds From Gert Town. The beat is heavy and crunkish with a hard whiny synth. 20-2-Life and PSK 13 serve ya street knowledge in "The Backstreets" over a gumbo pot of funk. There are way too many songs to go trough and review, but the album is full of hard gangster tales from the south, some struggling hustler joints, a few party joints, and a few reminiscent cuts, and little to no filler too! Don't let this one get away from you. It is rare and getting more expensive as time goes along. This album is a good description of the versatility of southern hip hop, good beats and harsh spits!

Foesum bring back that tight g-funk sound that made them great in 1996. The album is laced with laid back grooves sprinkled with faint whiny keyboard synths throughout. There is only a slight mainstream influence in I Know This Game, sort of a South style, with fast rapping and beats. A huge theme is Long Beach life through the album. These three have the right to be proud; Long Beach, Ca. has been a pool of rap talent, and these three are testament to that. They do step up the hard core factor just a little from Perfection, for the lyrics are just a little harder throughout; think of the songs "Hit a Lick" and "Playin Foe Keeps." Don't sleep on these LBC greats!

Mac Mall came real hard in 1996 with "Untouchable." With str8 sav mob style beats from Khayree, Mike Mosley, Ant Banks and one by Cold 187 um ("Opening Doors"), u know u gonna be noddin ya head for an hour. And then there's Mac Mall himself. He has one of the best flows of any West Coast MC. He's menacing, but treal throughout. Check out his wordplay on the title track. I love the Ant Banks space boogie beat on "Playa Tip." Mall shows you the real deal of strugglin and strivin for thrivin on "Ghetto Stardom" and "Opening Doors" (with Kokane's funky hook vocals). Mac Mall serves str8 lace game through tthe album. U can't fade this Crestside Mac.

1995, Houston's duo, South Circle drops a heated album on Suave Records. SC is Mr. Mike and Thorough. These guys can hold their own on the mic with relentless and wicked flows, and their lyrics can paint a crazy picture. Now there are 2 polar opposites of styles of production and lyricism: first, there is the laidback playa, rider, and smokin' G-Funk component; then, there is the tales from the darkside, and there is some social commentary here. On the lighter side, "Pimp Thang" is a laidback classic. The beat is bouncy G-Funk with some awesome whiny synths, a perfect lowrider anthem. There are a lotta whiny synths on this album, enough to fill a Dr. Dre or West Coast album, and I love it! I love the vocorder on the upbeat "New Day." The title track is a slow rollin' joint perfect to roll sideways to. A perfect smoked out chillin' joint is the Bar Kay's sampled "Attitudes," perfect for the pimps and playas. The production on this album is absolutely awesome! We have some social commentary on "Gotta Maintain" (f/ homie Eightball)with a nice laidback twangy G-Funk style beat about the struggles of life and society and coming up trying to keep one's head up. I love "Everyday Allday;" the beat is mad upbeat and pumps me up. Listen to the multi-layered keyboards on this joint!! Now, there is the darkside. There are some horrorcore songs here too. Eightball and MJG join in on the hoddsta anthem "Unsolved Mysteries." Mike and Thorough paint a vivid picture of a jail break and riot in "No Escape." Mike and T flex their lyrical skills on "Neva Take Me Alive" and let it be know they won't go down without a fight, and they won't let the possibility of a murder case deter them. One problem I have with "Mental Murder" is they talk about slapping Mother Teresa (RIP) and pullin' a gat on the Pope (John Paul RIP), so despite the lyricism, I skip this one. The beat is gothic funk with eerie keyboards. The diss towards the religious figures is the only spot I do not like about the album. The production is perfect, G-Funk to eerie horrorcore, and these 2 have good lyrical abilities.

Dayton Family's 2nd album "F.B.I. is nothing short of being a gangsta classic. They are from Flint, Michigan, and are not very well known, unfortunately. They mesh various styles of rap, often on the same track. They flow somewhat like a mix of Midwest and East Coast rappers over a medley of Midwest beats (fast beats, similar to Bone Thugs at times) and West Coast G-Funk. The song "Hand That Rocks The Cradle" is an example. It has a complex lyrical content with a mobbish Midwest foreground beat paired with a West Coast classic background beat: a whistly, whiny keyboard synth. They consistently use this method of meshing styles throughout the album, and that makes this one refreshing. They are very hard core, and are very clever lyrically.

In 1996, Oakland's Pimp Of The Year, no, Pimp Of The Century, Dru Down comes out with a sick album full of bay area fire and funk. With producers like Lev Berlak, DJ Fuze, DJ Daryl, Soopafly (credited by his name Priest Brooks), Battlecat, and a few others, you get a neat mix of Mobb Music and laidback G-Funk (Bay and L.A. inspired), and a plain out good time. Dru Down spits heat throughout and has great guests here too. "Playa Fo Real" is the joint. Battlecat really did up the beat, bouncy G-Funk and a slick whiny synth, one of his most original beats ever, and he is a phat beatsmith. DD gets his mack on nice and smooth. He calls out Too $hort on the mobbed out "Mista Busta" over a syrupy beat. This song contributed to the Luniz, C&H, Dru Down vs. Too Short beef that would prove violent thru '96 into '97. A slappin good time is found on "Heads & Shoulders" with DD gettin it horny, crunk, and disorderly over a "Smurphie's Dance" sample. The smooth but raunchy sex joint "Freaks Come Out" has a phat, smoked out laidback G-Funk beat with LV (from South Central Cartel/Coolio fame) dropping a hot and smooth hook. Then, we have the bay mobb music joints "500 Mobsters," and the bangin' "The Mobb." This joint is long but tight. The beat is nice and slick with neat keyboard melodies. "Suspect One" is another with more of a laidback beat but harsher rhymes to offset that atmosphere. The title track is cool with a neat coming of age story, but a predictable sample "Can You Feel It." Another classic is "Underestimated" where Soopafly adds a Long Beach G-Funk bouncy beat and a slick verse about how heads underestimated the 2 rappers. Overall, this album should be in anyone's collection. A phat album that should never be slept on. This album is smoother than Explicit Game from 2 years earlier and fun and humorous.

1993 and 1994, The Dayton Family straight outta Flint, Michigan makes some cuts and finally releases an album in 1995, their debut, What's On My Mind? Bootleg and Shoestring come real raw and hard on the mic. The beats produced by Steve Pitts are hard and heavy midwestern madness and many have an early crunk and southern vibe mixin some G-Funk here and there. The beats are cool for rollin' hard and are perfect driveby soundtracks as are the lyrics. Anyone lovin' hard core gangsta rap and horrorcore will love this one as it is definitely violent. "Watch Yo A--" is one of those prime examples as TDF peelin caps and pumpin' fear into ya ear. The title track is real hard. What's on their mind is some gruesome bloodbaths. The beat is a mix of rattling midwestern bass and crunk. The only issue I have with this song is about raping a girl, which is something I do take some offense to. I can always skip over that part of that song. "Smoke For Free" is the hooter joint with a swangin' G-Funk style beat with an eerie keyboard riff and a whiny synth perfect to ride to. They warn that hunnies comin to kick it can't smoke for free without having sex. "Potato Chip" has a slight reggae flava and drops some offbeat lyrics personifying bustas, snitches, and marks as favorite brand name chips. It is a hard, energetic joint. "Billy Blunt" is another crunk joint about loc'n off the weed with cool scratches and an interesting "Inspector Gadget" keyboard sample. I do not have to go too much into detail about all the songs here because the album is consistent in subject matter, but it is definitely worth a listen. Anyone listening to rap by Ganksta NIP, C-Bo, Brotha Lynch Hung, Gangsta Pat, and 3-6 Mafia will definitely dig this banger. The cool thing is that it can be found in stores still today, so get it before it goes outta print. If you dig this one, check out TDF's 1996 classic FBI for more of that "Dope Dayton Ave" game.

I don't mean to sound like everyone else, but what can I say, the album is on hit!! He has smooth, funky beats paired with very well-executed rhyming. "The World Is Yours" is the best becuase the beats are really sweet; he creates that classic older school jazzy New York style beat with the twist of the turntable. The other songs are on the same level of greatness!

Late '98, this album was released several months after Fat Pat passed, and it features him and some Screwed Up Click homies. As usual, Wreckshop in-house producers do up the beats real good. The beats often have a sunny and bouncy feel to lift your mood. Now, there is a lot of playerism and flossin in the lyrics, which I am not always a fan of, but this album is certainly a fun listen, and it bumps in my slab. The rappers deliver fun lyrics that complement the beats well. "Dreamz" is a classic, sunny relaxed joint with a sick RnB hook vocal. Pat, Hawk, and Mack all spit about wantin' to come up in the game. There is another mix on Fat Pat's Greatest Hits (2001), but the beat is different. "I'm a Slicka" is a bragadoccio, hot lowrider G-Funk banger, perfect to get crunk to at the party. "Jammin' Screw" gives dap to the late Houston DJ over a twangy, upbeat slumper beat. "Dirty South" is a hustler joint, a cool, bouncy anthem for the 3rd Coast. "Wreckshop" is a fun joint with a more mobbish, yet cool swingin beat, and Pat, D-Gotti, and Pimp Tyte represent for their record company. "Throwed In The Game" is a chill, keyboard ridden banger. "If You Only Knew" is a mega-relaxed "holla at a hunny" type joint with a sweet beat. Mainstream heads will definitely enjoy this album, and people who just want to have some laid-back fun will love the cool vibes and easy listening of the album. I often unwind after a hard day with this playin.' If you like this, then Fat Pat's solo debut, Ghetto Dreams from earlier in 1998 is essential material. R.I.P. Pat; keep hittin' swithches in heaven loc.

Mac Dre drops his debut, 1993's Young Black Brotha, now known as a yay area classic, and for good reason. Khayree provides a bangin' backdrop for Mac to drop his rhymes. Lyrically, Dre has a good flow and complements the beats very well, and even though the subject matter deals mostly with hustling, sex, gang life, and survival in the hood, he executes it very well making for a great listen. This album is definitely a soundtrack for life in Cali (especially in the bay). Since his affiliation with the Romper Room Gang in Vallejo, Ca (he references his affiliation many many times here) had him caught up in the system, many of the songs were rapped over the phone in the pen and timed to the beats. His rapping over the phone in joints like "Im N Motion" and others adds well to his street cred. I love the twangy G-Funk of "California Livin'" which gives off a sunny rider vibe. "2 Hard 4 The F----- Radio" is mad ill with another cool rider style funky beat, and ill flows showing why he ain't on the radio dials. Khayree takes time to create one of his great instrumentals in what else "A Piece From Khayree," a nice laid-back guitar ridden beat. He proves here to be a versatile producer, and would be sought after time after time from here on. Another phone rap is on the rider anthem "My Chevy" where he talks about "Chev strikin'" a bay area classic. My only criticism is the annoying "radio" interruption in the middle of "My Chevy," but in the second half, homie Mac Mall comes in to drop some game. If you like fun gangsta rap with bass heavy g-funk and mob beats, this album will NOT disappoint. Mac Dre and Khayree created a cult following for good reason. This album is tailor-made for bay area fans, but anyone on the west coast (or anyone period) will appreciate this banger. Mac Mall's Illegal Business? from 1993 has a similar vibe and is also essential bay area game for ya to bump.

Warren G still has that G-Funk passion in his second album. He puts more songs on this album, thank God!! He still has that fun, easy listening, rhythmic flow that makes him fun to listen to. His standout track, "Transformers," has a faint, whistly keyboard synth, and a neat use of a talk-box, and a funky, bass-heavy beat. He refuses to become a gimmicky rapper, and for that I give him props. He sounds calm and collected in the nice chill-out track "Relax Ya Mind." He does step up the hard-core factor a little since his first album. Songs like "What We Go Through" and "Reality" get into more of a gangsta mentality, but he does not overdo it. So, he offers something for gangsta rap fans, and fans of more laid back rap.

Over the last few years my musical tastes have changed. I used to be closed minded to rock music and listen mostly to rap and hip-hop and 60's and 70's soul and RnB. I do not listen to hip hop as much as I did before (still do from time to time), but my love for soul music 60's and 70's is as strong as ever. But then I started listening to oldies rock, 50's to early 70's and have fallen in love. I have albums like Midnight Ride 1966 to thank. I absolutely love cruising to this album at full blast, and love Mark Lindsay's gritty and bluesy voice. Most songs are originals (as opposed to covers). "I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone" (also done by the Monkees) is a cool song written by Bobby Hart and Tommy Boyce is a cool bluesy rocker, and I believe that the Raiders recorded it before the Monkees if I'm not mistaken. I love the energetic pulse of "Ballad of a Useless Man," again employing the use of bluesy instrumentation. "Kicks," written by famous pop composer Barry Mann and long time partner Cynthis Weil, co-composers of other artists like the Righteous Brothers at the time, was one of the most famous songs from the album, and the Raiders were the original recorders of it. It has a twangy up tempo vibe and also will get your head nodding. Most other songs are composed by band members, and are equally worthy of listening. "Get It On" is an advisory song about living one's life, and has a cool keyboard melody. The other songs are really cool as well. Depending on which re-release version you buy, there are some bonus songs that are cool like "Corvair Baby," and "Shake It Up." This pop-garage rock band surely makes some fun cruisin' music, and for that I have bought other slbums of theirs like Something Happening (1968), Spirit of '67 (later in 1966), and a few others. Great music it is for sure.

Many say Gangsta Rap fell off from 1997 and on (after 2Pac and B.I.G's deaths); I couldn't agree less. This album came out in mid 1998, and it is just as hard core as any Cali early to mid 90's album. He rhymes great as he spits hard knockin' lyrics over hard-core G-Funk beats. He has a hard voice, so it sounds appropriate when he spits G'd up rhymes. If you love music to lowride and hit switches to, this is good rider music. in my opinion, this is his best work, even better than "Killa Kali" ('95), and that was a really tight album too! The best track is "You Neva Know," where he discusses the unpredictability of hood life, or the loss thereof, over a smooth G-Funk beat laced with a faint background whiny synth. He is so slept on. I am glad I gave this album a try!

Bullet Loco comes tight on his second album. He still brings that underground heat, while appealing to mainstream heads as well. "Whatcha Gonna Do" (w/ DMX and Method Man) and the remix (w/ Mack Dime, WC/ and Redman) are surefire hits with the bangin west coast foreground beat with some hints of east coast beats in the horns in the background (esp. on the remix). The track "I'm Deadly" has the mobb style beat, like something Sam Sneed, Dre, Ice Cube would have used in the early to mid 90's; it is hot. It is old fashioned gangsta rap, plain and simple, and it works. "Nobody On dry Land" is a neat, melodic, underground feeling track. There is some element of G-Funk on tracks like "Love Don't Love" (w/Kokane)and "Lovely." The South East San Diego element is evident on the beat "Easy To Get In" which slams in the trunk. The track with EightBall and MJG "How Angry" is also cool with a neat southern influenced beat. all in all, jayo and his production team have hit us with a late 90's powerhouse with all the well roundedness of the production of this album.

1994, my favorite year in rap, features a short EP by these Rap-A-Lot O.G.s from Houston. Lo-Life, E-Rock and A.G. come thru with some dope g'd up flava over dope deep-fried G-Funk (hence the name of the EP: what else, Gangsta Funk); beats are produced by Mike Dean, and N.O. Joe. N.O. Joes are more southern fried, while Mike Deans are more P-Funkish. The beats are hella dope and these guys all get the party crunk, and keep it gutter through this short banger. I love the P-Funk centered "Once Again It's On" with the bouncy beat and whiny synth, a phat lowrider ready joint. The title track is a little slower over a N.O. Joe twangy beat and is perfect to roll the SLAB to. If you want some gangsta, peep "Reason" over another N.O Joe beat with a deep, mobbish feel. "Lo-Life In The Street" is a hard edged track where Lo-Life looks over his shoulder in the hood. This EP is a phat example of good southern gangsta rap from the 90's, but of course, these guys were horribly slept on, and continue to be. If you like this, peep their Rated G from 1995 and Usual Suspects from 1997 for some more of that southern-fried gangsta game by some real O.G.'s.

E-A-Ski is a dope Mobb Music-G-Funk producer from Oakland who never gets the credit he deserves. His beats are hard, yet often melodically sophisticated. He is a gangsta rapper too, and flexes his skills with Montell Jordan's cool hook vocals on 1997's "Showdown." It was supposed to be from a 1997 or early 1998 album called Earthquake; I wonder what happened to that album!?! The beat is hard and heavy, with keyboard twang. There are 4 other tracks that dissapoint, not because of the beats, but the length. They average a minute and a half long each! The beats are his typical mobb-funk, and are very well done. I like the whiny synths on "Earthquake" f/ Ice Cube, and the twangy P-Funky "Mad Doggin" f/ Jayo Felony and "Welcome To California;" it just sucks that they are not full-length joints because they woulda been hits in my opinion. The beats and spits are hard and tight. The single gets 4 stars due to the beats, and the full-length banger "Showdown." I wonder if the album was never released, or if it is one of those hella rare, can't find anywhere albums . I bet it woulda been a straight banger.

Compton's MC Ren comes hella hard on his 3rd album, The Villain In Black from early 1996, even though most of the songs were recorded in 1995, givin' the album a 1995 feel to it. The album is short, only 9 songs (2 skits), but it is interesting. Ren still kicks in those trill gangster tales with an underground feel. I Love "Keep It Real" the most. Dr. Jam kicks in a twangy, bouncy west coastin' G-Funk groove with a slam of lyrics about keepin it authentic and shakin' the phony busters. Cold 187 Um from Above The Law handles some of the production here, and does it well. The beat on "It's Like That" is some seriously hot and original sounding G-Funk as he is well known for. 187 also heats up some more serious, experimental fonk on "Mind Blown" and "Bring It On" (the latter featuring Above The Law). Other songs have less of a G-Funk feel and more of an underground rawness giving the listener a menacing feel. The beats and rhymes on "Still The Same N---a,"Mad Scientist" "and "I Don't Give A Damn" definitely border on straight horrorcore; the latter has a beat bordering on a mix of G-Funk and a west coast version of boom-bap. Ren can flow decent and he makes for good gangsta rap, perfect for a hood soundtrack. Gangsta Rap and underground heads should definitely check this one out before it skyrockets to 50 dollars like many other rare classics. Check out Ruthless For Life, his next album from 1998 for some more gangster tales, but with more of a G-Funk atmosphere.

1994 certainly was an awesome year on all coasts (west, east, south), and up north. Uncle Sam's Curse was horribly slept on, and thanks to the internet and a much more commercialized hip-hop scene, now everybody wants to buy this one. Cold 187um serves you with some experimental and original beats drawing upon that G-Funk sound that the Pomona Playas helped popularized a few years ago (Was it Dr. Dre or Cold 187um who started G-Funk? The debate remains) Many of the beats are hella different than the other G-Funk of the time, and some are different period (but in a lovable way)!! Lyrically, the album is less pimpin and more political. "Uncle Sam's Curse," the title track is prime example, analyzing the plight of the brotha and sista in the U.S. "Black Superman" is definitely the joint here. I love the lyrics depicting a brotha getting his mother out of the ghetto and trying to make a better life. It is moving when they dropped a line about a mother calling her son her black superman! They discuss the gang truce and drug dealing and hustling from a much different perspective than most rappers do. The beat is hot with a slick whiny synth and a tight vocorder. I also love "One Tyme Two Meny." The beat is bouncy, and the hook features a wierd, but dope vocal. Listen to the dude's hella raspy voice as he recites "you don't know why one time's always trippin." They bring up a scenario where a homie has a hot girl in his car and he brags about the drugs he and his cuddies has, and to his surprise, she is an undercover cop, and he is busted. They take on a social stance on how police officers always assume the worst about black folks, and how it upsets these Pomona playas (hence the slang term for police (one time)). Above The Law kills each track with relentless flows and spits discussing social issues. Definitely, this is a lyrical album. They discuss the proverbial fork in the road in "Rain Be For The Rain Bo." They rap about choices in people's lives and discuss the trappings in the hood life and make references to the government as having a part in that cycle, and Kokane adds his moany hook vocals as he does in much of the album. Tone Loc steps in with ATL on "Who Ryde." "Concrete Jungle" is a little more gangsta with some harder lyrics. There is a couple of pimpin type songs though, like "The "G" In Me" with a nice old-school inspired funky beat. Definitely more of a lyrical album than many other G-Funk albums. The beats are different, and a few may take some time to get used to, but they will grow on you and you will recognize Cold 187um's real talent.

WC finally gets a chance to release a solo album, 1998's The Shadiest One. Ater about a decade in the rap game at this point, WC has several group albums with Mad Circle and earlier (in the 80's) with Low Proile. This album came out when the West Coast was losing popularity in the game and the shift in focus went back east. This album is full of fun and bouncy G-Funk and crazy spits by WC. Production goes to Battlecat, Ant Banks, Daz Dillinger, Barr 9, Crazy Toones, among a few others, and all bring their A-game to the boards. Battlecat's "Hog" is an upbeat bouncy lowrider joint with cool keyboards and a vocorder. "F--kin' Wit Uh House Party" is simply a phat joint. Battlecat again provides an energetic lowrider beat, and WC spits funny rhymes about going to a house party with a hoochie amongst rival gang members and gettin beat down, and he gets revenge. The beat is some of the phattest G-Funk I have heard in a long time. Young Tre laces a sunny laidback Cali beat on "Keep Hustlin'" with WC, Too Short and E-40 all delivering their trademark styles, and 40 Water really spits here. All their different rapping styles make for an entertaining listen. "Just Clownin'" is another Battlecat joint with a bass-heavy, deep-groove beat; WC describes about "snatchin' muthaf----s outta Nissan trucks" when Run-DMC starting out. He drops funny lines like that throughout the album. He may be humorous but he is definitely street and both elements create what we like about WC, along with his changeable flows that stay in tune with the beats. "Cheddar" is a fair Westside Connection hustler joint that sounds like it would be good for the clubs over a Mo' Suavea' southern bounce beat. Ant Banks produces the title track feat. CJ Mac. The beat is almost identical to Banks's beat on the title track his own album, 1995's Do Or Die, only the whiny synth is more prevalent here and the beat is a little faster. CJ and Dub drop some crazy street flows. "Betta Days" is a relaxed, soulful, smooth G-Funker, and WC gives an A-1 performance with a sick flow. The lyrics are deep. Dub can't believe that he made it to the year 1998 considering how crazy life was in his hood, with the loss of friends and gang violence. He drops some philosophy about how to carry on with life. Ron Banks from the Dramatics drops some dope hook vocals. "It's All Bad" is menacing with a hard beat and angry, loud, pessimistic flows by Dub. All in all, if you want an entertaining album with fast gangsta flows, great, funky beats, and some humor mixed in, then this one is for you.

Erick Sermon brings heat on his first solo after EPMD split. 1993's No Pressure has a lot going for it. He may have competition in the MC department, but the production is what we like most about his albums. The beats are simply immaculate. I love the East-West collabo with Kam and Ice Cube, on "The Ill S---;" the title is self explanatory with each givin' A-1 performances rippin the mic to shreds, and the beat suits each one's styles well. All 3 have aawesome chemistry together. I love the Zapp and Roger samples on tracks like "Stay Real" where u can hear Roger's talk box sampled in the hook. Redman and Keith Murray make appearances, and that just adds to the entertainment. All in all, simply, this album slaps all the way thru!

Redman comes more raw than ever with his second album. Laced with bass heavy P-Funk samples, like his first album, Redman tears up the mic with his unique flow and eccentric subject matter. His lyrics really do come from Darkside! Dr. Trevis is hilarious in the interludes and the intro! The beats will have your trunk thumpin for quite a while.

Slick Rick comes back in 1994 with another album amid judicial woes, the appropriately titled Behind Bars. I am not an expert on Slick Rick, for this is the only album I own by him, but he is entertaining. With production by Paul Huston, Vance Wright, Easy Mo Bee, himself, and some remixing by Warren G and Pete Rock, the beats are bass heavy and funky and will rock ya system. Ricky has a dope flow and adapts it well to the beats. He can definitely tell a story, and by listening to Warren G and Snoop Doggy Dogg on their albums, it is easy to see where the influence came from. Behind Bars (title joint) is phat and jazzy boom-bap, and the way he uses his voice and flow, it is almost like there is two of him rapping trading verses! His story is funny. The remix is a Warren G G-Funk beat with Warren G giving a west coast perspective of the county jail. "Sittin' In My Car" is funny too; I love the way he analyzes his relationships with women. Doug E. Fresh adds his slick beat box over a jazzy, soulful background, and his singin' in the hook had a dude rollin on the floor bustin' up! "A Love That's True" is another funny way Rick goes over his relationships with the ladies and wants a good relationship instead of the bad ones he goes through. The beat is lovably odd ball: bumpy, bouncy, with earth shattering bass and intermittent whistles. His relationship with women is a huge theme in this album. "I'm Captive" is mad energetic, and he seems to be stuck in wierd relationships. To really understand this album, you need to really pay attention to his oddball stories because if you miss a word, it will be hard to keep up. If you want an album full of funk and fun, this one is for you.

Dove Shack's solo release "This Is The Shack" is nothing short of slammin. It combines laid back G-Funk like the cut "Smoke Out" (with a nice, heavy bass and whiny keyboard synths) with smooth R&B as in "Summertime In The LBC," adding in bumpin, funky party tracks like "East Side Party," and throws in some harder gangsta flava for your ear in tracks like "Rollin Wit A Gang." The album is well-rounded production wise, and the beats are awesome. The album is prime for a top down ride down the AVE! There is something great about Long Beach; it has spawned yet another super rap act and album. Too bad, these cats haven't released any more since this one came out in 95! If you love the styles of Warren G, Foesum, Twinz, DPG, this is an essential addition to your LBC/rap collection!

"Conversation" is one of the most slept-on, but best albums to come from Long Beach, Ca. If you love smooth G-Funk and Warren G, then this is a surefire hit. The songs are loaded with great rhyming and smooth whiny g-funk beats that epitomize Cali funk. "Good Times" is a dope track with the Twinz reminiscing of the positives in coming up in such a rough neighborhood. "Don't Get it Twisted" is also strong; it has a harder beat with a whiny, whistly keyboard synthesizer implemented in each verse before the hook.

E-Dubb brings it in 1995's Double Or Nothing. Many say he does not have a good flow or deent lyrics. If you want killa flow, try Nas, Biggie, Snoop, E-40, Mr.Sermon's homie Redman, Big L, or whatever. Erick Sermon is decent on the mic; he can bust some rhymes when he wants, but he wants you to know, his fortay is production. The beats slam all the way thru with that Cosmic Slop!!! His beats range from deep groove funk, to bass heavy almost boom-bap. This music is definitely great house party or rider music. He is easily one of the best producers on the East Coast, if not across the continent. Beats like those on "Welcome" "Boy Meets World" almost approach a G-Funk atmosphere. Other beats such as the ones on "Bomdigi" "Do Your Thing" have that awesome bass shakin' East Coast thump. Any one from the East, West, South, or Midwest should find at least something to bump here. Also, check out his solo debut, No Pressure from 1993 for that funk fo ya trunk.

Reggie Noble spits nothing but fire on his third solo release. The beats are a little less based on P-Funk samples, but they are still funky enough; they tend to hint more at old school bass heavy East Coast beats. Redman is as entertaining as ever with his witty and eccentric humor. Method Man nakes an appearance with Redman on the hit track "Do What ya feel." The two have an incredible rapping history, and make great hits together. Don't sleep on this classic album

South Central Cartel has a dope underground thing goin' on despite signed to Def Jam for this 1994 joint. Havoc, Prodeje, Havikk, L.V. DJ Gripp and DJ Kaos represent for that So Cali to the fullest. Beatwise, some of the beats may leave a little more to be desired; some may need to grow on you for a while. Then again, there are many that slap while in the deck! Prodeje is nathan to mess wit on the boards and Gripp and Kaos come correct too. Havoc, Prod, and Havi-double-k tear the mic up with those loc'd azz gangster tales. One classic is "Servin' Em Heat" with a loud, bouncy Zapp sample. Dope rappers Big Mike and 3-2 from Rap-A-Lot and southern fame come kick in some g'd up game in the G-Funk-da-fied melody "Gang Stories." "Gangsta Team" is a long but dope track with what else, a team of the best from the west, 2Pac, Spice 1, Ice-T, and MC Eiht trade in verses with SCC makin' a hella tight Bay 2 LA connection over a fast and hard beat. SCC represents the set in "It's A SCC Thang" over one of the best G-Funk beats I've ever heard, perfect to swerve thru the streets with the melodic beats and relentless flows. Gangsta Rap may not have been nathan new by '94, but SCC definitely delivers with their especially heated lyrics. Cali heads should not sleep on this one! G-Funk classics like this should not be slept on, but are. If you like this one, check out Spice 1-AmeriKKKa's Nightmare, Havoc and Prodeje-Kickin Game, Pooh Man- Ain't No Love, Big Mike- Somethin' Serious all from 1994, and G-Funk classics in the gangster vein.

Richie Rich comes out strong on his '96 album "Seasoned Veteran." It is good music to lowride to. "Funk"(#2) has a really hard-core beat and excellent rhyming. "Let's Ride" (#4), is a funky anthem about the Cali rider mentality! Of course, 2Pac's appearance in "N---az Done Changed" (#9), paired with a menacing beat and Richie Rich's hard, but laconic rhyming, makes it a hit. He rep's the Oaktown to the fullest.

DJ Quik does it again in '98, 3 3/4 years after Safe+Sound! Even though he does refine his sound to be more with the times, there is still an inherent influence of, and tribute to, the old school. Funky songs like "I Useta Know Her" run like a Roger and Zapp song with Quik's talkbox and fast party beats. Quik still makes those deep-bass G-Funk grooves as in "So Many Wayz," "You'z A Ganxta," & "We Still Party." He also gets very sexual and pimpish on songs like "Medley for a "V" (The P---y Medley)" and many more, but the beats are addicting. The song "No Doubt" is interesting; the beat sounds a little computerized. And "Hand in Hand" is another G-Funk classic citing the balance and relationship between hustling, money, power, and sex in the game over a different but bumpin' beat.

I may be mainly a West Coast and Southern Rap fan, but I definitely dig the East Coast sound too. Pete Rock is easily one of my favorite producers with his boombastic, bass heavy beats and perfectly tailored scratches, and CL Smooth's butta flow fits the beats sweetly; this EP from 1991 is no exception. "Good Life" is a cool jazz-horn laden banger with CL droppin knowledge of heads trying to up their stations in life. The Group Home mix has a cool drum-laden boom bap beat. "Mecca And The Soul Brother" is a sweet melody driven classic that clearly displays the chemistry between MC and producer. CL flexes his skills hard here. I love the adrenaline paced Pete Rock solo, "The Creator" with a cool, fast paced drum laden boom bap beat with jazz horns in the hook, and Pete Rock really flows here. The joint is upbeat and has a cool swagger to it. He shows that he leads, not follows. CL lets sucker MC's know they can't fade his flow on what else, the funky "Go With The Flow." The title track has another fast paced vibe. When CL can talk about watermelon seeds and felons in the same sentence and make them relevant, you know he got skills. This EP is a classic primer for the 1992 full length banger Mecca And The Soul Brother. After 1994's classic The Main Ingredient (yes, 3 straight classics), there would be no more Pete Rock and CL Smooth duo albums, just a few songs here and there together; what a shame because the rap game could use them united as a duo right now.

D-Shot brings together a sick comp disc of some of the best underground acts from the West Coast, ranging from Mac Mall to Spice 1, 3X Krazy, to South central Cartel's Prodeje and Havoc, and DMS from Seattle. The standout tracks are the 1) G-Funk classic "Streets Made Me" by D-Shot and Spice 1, with that funky smooth beat by Prodeje 2)"Hit The Gas" by 3X Krazy (also on their album Sick-O), and 3) Prodeje and Havoc's "I Puts It Down." Since it came out in 1995, you know there will be no shortage of that Cali G-Funk. I liked the variety of artists and production. This album is perfect for any West Coast rap fan.

2nd II None's second effort,"Classic 220," is yet another tight DJ Quik production, Like in most of Quik's productions, there is an inherent light-hearted G-Funk sound laced with fun, partyish themes. KK and Gangsta D spit nothing but game here. They party in "Up 'N Da Club" (w/ Quik and AMG, who is hilarious), "Pawdy," and the talk-box laced "Back Up Off The Wall." They Get sexual in "Whateva U Want," "Don't U Hide It." They get reflective on the hard life in the hood in "Y?" rhymed over whiny synthesizers and a funky background beat. Don't let this one slip by you!

As a heavy fan of G-Funk West Coast and Southern rap from the 90's, many may think I have no love for the East Coast. That can't be farther from the truth. I have this 1994 timeless classic, as well as PR and CL's Mecca And The Soul Brother, and I like these guys as much as my west and south coast fav's. Pete Rock's beats and scratches are fantasy come true, pure funk-jazz, soul, boom-bap bass, and smooth, cool keyboards. The only other producer who has as much talent behind the boards may be DJ Premier from Gang Starr; well, Erick Sermon has deep groove funk seepin' out his veins, and his beats rock too. But, The Main Ingredient has beats that take hip-hop to another level. CL Smooth has such a slick flow throughout, and his rapping voice just fits in like a piece of the puzzle. His raps are as smooth as the beats. CL is lyrical, and his rhymes are among the best on the East Coast. He is as much for the playas and pimps with his butta lyrics on "Caramel." Pete Rock's beautiful beat on "Take You There" are as smooth and melodious as G-Funk but the beat has that perfect East Coast bass and keyboard tang, and CL spits some fire to perfectly complement the music. Just like on Mecca, Pete Rock has brief instrumentals at the beginning and end of many joints. A nice rawer boom-bap joint here is "Sun Won't Come Out." CL has a harsher flow and a more menacing atmosphere. He really flexes his battle skills here. The title track has a mad different beat. Twangy foreground beat laden with horns has a refreshing and original vibe with some beautiful whistly vibes in the middle of the verses. CL kicks some busta-free battle lyrics again. "I Got A Love" is vintage old-school influenced bump and bass, and CL kicks some playa flava. There is not one joint I skip here, a rare feat in hip-hop. This one gets more play than many of my fav West Coast joints. This album definitely sets the standard of the East Coast, and for anywhere for that matter. This is a memorable album from my favorite year in rap: 1994. Any one from anywhere should have no trouble lovin' this masterpiece. Mecca And Soul Brother from 1992 is also essential.

The Isley Brothers hae been putting out quality, classic material for several decades, and this album, which came out in 1983 is still on hit today! Of course, there is the silky smooth R&B classic, "Between The Sheets" that rapper/producers like Jermaine Dupri sampled on Da Brat's "FunkDaFied," and like Sean "Puffy" Combs did on Biggie's "Big Poppa." But this album is more than just the title cut. There is a nice mixture of styles, like the fast paced party funk tracks like "Way Out Love" and "Rock You Good" make you want to dance or lowride with the top down. There are other silky tracks here as well, like the slow tempo "Choosy Lover" and "Touch Me." The Isley's vocals are among the best of R&B past and present, and they showcast them extremely well through the album! The mid-tempo track "I Need Your Body," is smooth and fun to just chill to! Overall, the album is just pure acoustic and lyrical fun (feel good music!). This music is also a good romantic mood setter to play when on a date!

Dead End Alliance "D.E.A." as presented by The Screwed Up Click, is a nice smooth album to slap in the ride. With a mix of decent though not groundbreaking hustler, flossy, and gangster tales over awesome production, you have a nice album. The beats range from southern fried to laid back whiny G-Funk. "Sun Hit Da Fade" is my favorite, a perfect lowrider anthem on a sunny day. "Money Money" is a hustler anthem with a nice bouncy G-Funk beat. "Full Time Playa" a silky smooth, laid back anthem for the ballers; the beat is simply amazing. All in all, the album is a bangin. Houston Ain't Playin!

When mentioning the soul greats from the 60's and 70's, rarely do the Continental IV (4)receive mention. My first exposure to their charming harmony and soulful vibe was with a song "I Don't Have You" (1970). I was immediately struck with the ethereal harmony and sweet instrumentation. I found out after some research that they did release an album, this one, Dream World. I believe that the album was released in (or around) 1972. The vinyl is rare, and the cd reissue is too. I finally came into extra money a few months ago and sent probably the best 70 dollars of my life. I truly enjoy the whole album from the first to last track. "I Don't Have You" is on this album indeed, as are a few other songs I have heard previous to buying the cd reissue. "How Can I Pretend" (single issued in 1971, and "Day By Day (Every Minute On The Hour)" (also 1971) are 2 other sdongs I heard before buying the album. All three songs I mentioned have the heavenly early 70's neo-doo-wop close harmony that I love. But there are other great songs as well, often with different vibes too. "Nite Moods" has a sweet jazzy and even slightly psychedelic vibe to it. "Escape From Planet Earth" is funkier and even more psychedelic and trippy with fun, spacy lyrics. "The Love You Gave To Me" is even funkier and more uptempo hinting at the funk/disco influence starting to spread circa 1972. One of my favorite songs is "(You're Living In A) Dream World." This song reminds me of other groups like the Thom Bell produced Stylistics (at the time) with the use of the sitar guitar and the dreamy musicscape. "Running Away From Love" again has that doo-wop inspired harmony, and the sitar laced in the song. "Take A Little Time To Know Me" is another sweet harmony song. There is a neat Motown cover, "Heaven Must Have Sent You," originally done by the Elgins in 1966, whose version I have hear and love as well(I believe their version is the original; it is well-known that Motown artists cover each others' songs). The Continetal IV's version is classily handled with the added lush Philly vibe this time. I believe the album as a whole is basically a collection of songs dating back as early as. Whatever the real story is behind the making and release of the album, I find it to be a delightful Philly Soul classic which I proudly blast in my car or even at work, and other people hearing me play them, most of whom are much older than I am who also grew up on this soul music(I was born in the 80's and love this music with a passion) absolutely love it when I play this album. Being a huge Intruders, Delfonics, Blue Magic fan (among countless popular and under the radar soul groups), I really enjoy Dream World. It is rare and expensive but worth every cent to save up and buy. Keep supporting the artists, popular or under the radar, who have given rise to true RnB music like the Continental IV. One can even download a couple songs from them on Amazon.

Al-D came out with a tight album in early 1996 called Home Of The Free, a bangin 12 track album. This one is the 2006 rerelease, with 3 bonus tracks at the end of D's 1997 "Mind At Ease." As for Home..., Al D does a great job representing H-Town to the fullest. I don't see the production credits, for they are niot given here on the rerelease, and I do not have the 1996 original, but the beats bang one after another, so the producers heat up the tracks with fire. "Lost In Tha Hood" has a nice West Coast influenced G-Funk beat and relentless gangster flows by D. "Let Me Blow" is hella sick, a nice bouncy G-Funk beat and whiny synths, a banger to light a spliff, or ride to on sunny day. "Can U See This" is another scorcher, with a nice soufside beat with socially and politically heated lyrics. Just let the trillness hit u upside the head. DJ Screw (RIP to an original)throws in a few screws in to end the original 1996 portion of the album. "Screw 1" is a screwed version of "Lost In Tha Hood." "Welcome 2 Tha Jungle" closes off the original with a dope Tyrone Davis "In The Mood" sample and a sick slowed down beat. The last 3 are classics "Y U Hate Me," " Mind At Ease," and "Shady Daze," from his 1997 EP as I mentioned above. If you can get this one, do it. I want my hands on the original 1996 Jam Down Records album. It is hella rare and outta print. Get this and 97's Mind At Ease for some real rap music! I just cannot believe I am the first to review this one!!!

Chicano underground great Slow Pain puts it down for So Cali in 1995 (rereleased in 2004) in the Baby O.G. The beats are awesome G-Funk with much bounce to the ounce. My favorite track is "Ride With Me," a smooth rider anthem with a nice whiny synth; this banger epitomizes the laidback mentality of the Cali lifestyle. "My Trigger" is another tight one. It features fellow chicano rapper ALT and Foesum's T-Dubb who all kick in gangster flows. "Saturday Night Ballin," is hot, perfect for a house party, and it has a remix, which is a hidden bonus track. The Remix is hella bouncy with a nice beat for the six-fo. "Slow Pain (To The Left, To The Right)" is a perfect one for old-school and new school heads, with the tight beat and non-stop flows by Slow Pain. All in all, The Baby O.G. is a fun under the radar classic, awesome bouncy funk, perfect for the tricked up, chromed out lowrider Schwinn bikes with stereos hooked up on them you see riding down the Cali Streets.

This album is not a new (for 2000)album between Top Dogg and Last Meal; this is a collective of older material. Believe it or not, the songs are dope to classic Snoop Dogg, but if all the reading I did is correct, this album was released without Snoop's desire (perhap's Death Row's Snoop Doggy Dogg's Greatest Hits was too), perhaps by Death Row's faltering empire trying to squeeze out as much money as possible. The songs are dope though, and the music is not why this album garners a 3 star rating. I respect Snoop Dogg's legacy, and if I found out about this before buying this I would just have to refuse buying this make due without classic tracks like "Hit Rocks" a real Snoop banger with a fantastic G-Funk beat, and "Change Gone Come" and the bouncy upbeat feel of bangers like "May I" gangstger inflected "Gangsta Walk." The beats on this album are hot as are the songs which remind the listener of the old Snoop, the loccest crip outta LBC with that laid back flow. The 3 stars are for the good music, and the missing 2 stars are for the rip-off of Snoop's music. If I'da known it, I probably would of passed this on in support of Snoop.

It is extremely hard to find any of the Intruders' albums reissued on cd. I am too young to have even been born when the Intruders were in their heyday, but I truly love their music, and Gamble and Huff composed some awesome, breathtaking backdrops for these true soul crooners. 1973's Save The Children is a gorgeous, harmony rich album with melodies for millennia: the title track is a song that Gil Scott-Heron originally made in 1971, and the Intruders keep it classy and smooth just like Heron's original. There are a few other covers here that are also well-executed: "Teardrops" from Lee Andrews and the Hearts in the 50's gets the smooth Philly treatment. Paul Simon's "Mother and Child Reunion" also gets a proper Philly makeover. I am not crazy about covers (I love originals the best), but at least the Intruders choose songs that accentuate their crooning and harmony style, and they make them delightfully sweet. Of course there are several wonderful Gamble and Huff and the Intruders originals. My favorite song here (probably one of my top Intruders and Philly soul songs), "I Wanna Know Your Name." "I Wanna..." gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. It is the epitome of slow-drag dance songs. The harmony is absolutely impeccable. When I get to the track, I often repeat it several times. The song is so soft, sweet, classy, and innocent, as opposed to the over-sexed autotune laced RnB posturing of today. In my opinion, this song itself makes it worth the cost of buying the cd. "I'll Always Love My Mama" is the upbeat early disco type song which will elevate your spirits. The elaborate orchestration makes it a lush dance winner, as does the positive message in the song abot showing love to one's mother. "Memories Are Here to Stay" is another gorgeous song with a nice piano by TG Conway, and other production by Theodore Life, of MFSB band fame. The production backdrop allows the Intruders to really shine on this heartbreaking song about a lost love. "To Be Happy Is the Real Thing" is a mellow mid-tempo winner with beautiful string orchestration. "Little Sonny" Brown makes a wonderful lead singer, and the rest of the group backs him up wonderfully. The Intruders were never as prominent as the O'Jays, the Stylistics, and even the Delfonics (my favorite soul group), but they sure had talent and beautiful harmony. One interesting note, the greatest hits package, 1995's Epic Records: Cowboys to Girls: The Best of the Intruders has almost the entire Save the Children album except for one song: "Memories Are Here to Stay." I say that you'll miss out on a lovely song if you still do not have the Save The Children album though. Snatch it up before it ends up at and wildly expensive price: it surely is a classic in my book. The cd reissue has wonderful sound quality, and will sound clear and crisp wherever you may play it.

The Philly legensds, The Delfonics release their 3rd album, their self-titled 1970 classic. This album has some real memorable cuts here. I really dig William Hart's falsetto "Trying To Make A Fool Of Me" is such a beautiful track; it has some of the best choral harmonization I have ever heard. The beat is nice, rolling funk with a nice sitar and horn added. The joint is kinda sad where a guy needs to be let go in a head-game filled relationship. It is one of my favorite soul jams ever. "Didn't I (Blow Your Mind this Time)" again employs the early 70's sitar trademark. Again, the harmonization is outstanding, and the chorus has a heavenly, airy feel to it. A sweet slow jam is "I Gave To You." William Hart really digs deep into the soul with this romantic charmer. "Baby I Love You" is a nice, mid-tempo joint lush with melody and a upbeat vibe. When the group "bop bop bop bop's" early and later on, it will give you goosebumps. "Down Is Up, Up Is Down" is faster paced deals with more hardships of the romance game using an interesting metaphor. "Funny Feeling" is even faster paced, cool for dancin' to. All I can add is that the album is wonderful; I hear nothing today that even gomes a hundredth of the way to measuring up to this one, and this album is 12 years older than I am. The Delfonics are one of my favorite soul groups (along with the Stylistics).

As a proud owner of all Snoop's solos, 2 Eastsidaz albums and the 213 album from 2004, I can easily say this one is one of his better albums. The production on this album rocks with some dope latter day (1999) G-Funk from a bevy of dope producers. "Snoopafella" gets his story tellin' on over a sick Ant Banks (he rarely if ever dissapoints!) sampling "Dazz." "Gangsta Ride" feat Silkk The Shocker is a hot rider anthem over a bouncy Meech Wells westcoastin beat. DJ Quik heats up the boards with his melodic funk on "Buss'n Rocks" and the silky "Don't Tell" (f/ Mausberg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G). "My Heat Goes Boom" is a nice Gangsta track with Snoop kickin some real game. Snoop seems at ease and comfortable and his rhymes reflect that. A couple tracks are weak, such as the boring "Ghetto Symphony" with the No Limit homies and the overly slow "Somethin' Bout Yo Bidness," but Snoop makes up for them with tracks like the Dr. Dre banger "Just Dippin'" a nice way to bring the 2 back together over a nice laidback rider beat and the fast paced "20 Minutes" with Goldie Loc; both kick in some fast paced gangsta rhymes over a bouncy beat that could only come outta Long Beach; it was produced by Goldie Loc too. "I Love My Momma" is really self-explanatory with a nice older sounding G-Funk beat from Meech Wells. Overall, a good album by S.N. dubble O. P.

I love the Motown Two-Fers. This one is no exception. This cd is a re-issue of Gladys Knight and the Pips' 1967 album Everybody Needs Love and 1968 Feelin' Bluesy album. Both albums are chock full of that Motown charm blessed with the harmonies of the Pips and the gracious soulful voice of Gladys Knight herself. The first album contains what I consider to be the best and most definitive version of "I Heard It Through The Grapevine"(among seemingly countless versions from within the Motown camp or from out of it for that sake). I think either Smokey Robinson and the Miracles or Marvin Gaye were the first to record the Norman Whitfield composition, but Gladys Knight and the Pip's version is the best to me. Their version is so energetic, and the musicianship on this version shows what was to come a year later: the psychedelic soul movement, and this song here shows the beginning stages of it with the funky, groovy vibe it creates. This is one of my favorite Motown songs of all time. "You Don't Love Me No More" is a moody, softer ballad, with pleading vocals. "Do You Love Me Just A Little, Honey" shows Gladys Knight and the Pips' doo-wop roots with the soft, sweet harmonic vibe and the background "Chonnie on chon's," another soulful winner here. "Everybody Needs Love," another often covered Motown tune, recorded previously by acts such as the Temptations, is a jazzier, yet more raw at teh same time, yet then also cool vibing version.The other songs are cool as well. Now for the 1968 Feelin' Bluesy album, there are also cool cuts here. "The Boy From Crosstown" is another driving soulful number with a rolling bass about a crosstown boy whom a woman loves, and whom the people in her town think to be taboo. "The Boy..." also foreshadows the psychedelic soul sound about to explode much more loudly late that year with The Temptations "Cloud Nine." "Ain't You Glad You Chose Love" also has a similar vibe, yet is more uptempo, and is even a step closer to that psych soul sound. "It Should Have Been Me" is a sweet harmonic groove with the nice call and response gospel flavored sound often associated with Gladys Knight and the Pips. "Your Old Standby" is a sad song about a woman on the outside of a man she loves and his on and off girlfriend. This song seems as if it was recorded much earlier (than 1968). It has more of a 1963'ish sound to it, for stylistically, it treads the line between the doo-wop Motown of 1959-63, and the mid 60's soul explosion, so I am curious as to the recording date of this cool "oldie." "It's Time To Go Now" explores the necessity of moving on from a relationship that was fun. This one sounds musically like it is from the late 60's but is in the sweet doo-wop harmony style. It is a sad but beautiful groove. There are a few bonus songs at the end of the cd, like a circa 1970 re-recording of Gladys Knight and the Pips' own 1961 doo-wop classic "Every Beat Of My Heart," retaining the doo-wop vocal style. This Two-Fer is sure a trip back to when RnB music had so much soul and groove, and when Gladys Knight was just beginning to become more popular, a trend that would continue in earnest through the 70's. The albums show Gladys Knight's versatility and soulful singing talents, and the sweet harmony with which the Pips back her.

C-Bo's One Life 2 Live is a neat endeavor throught the streets of Sacramento's hood. The beats range from hardcore G-Funk, to a few more laid back funky party beats. Lyrically though, he sticks to the script and delivers us good old fashioned gangsta rap. Fans of West Coast hard core and G-Funk should find satisfaction in this release. Club Hoppin' is a fun, bouncy track with a beat reminiscent of Mtume's or George Clinton's 80's work with a funky guitar riff on the side. I Can't See the Light is dope, with a menacing beat and stone cold rhyming.

It's 1996. Khayree creates pure magic over an immense array of raw and funky beats, while Young lay tears up the mic. These 2 elements create the masterpiece called Black 'N Dangerous. Lay holds nothing back and delivers an unapologetic and uncensored look at hood life. The tracks "Playah's Mode" and "Black 'N Dangerous" are bangin, his flow is unstoppable over hot lowrider G-Funk Beats. YBB creates another hot album; any West Coast rap fans needs to peep and add to their colletion.

Sho, a homie of Willie D of the Geto Boys, releases a solo album to little fanfare in 1993 under Wrap/Wize Up Records, the same label Willie D would release his bangin' 2nd album Play Witcha Mama the next yeat (1994). The beats are deep-fried southern funk. The production by the 2 Horsemen and Willie D ranges is pretty good for 1993 standards, but the equipment may be to blame for some bad sound quality on a few. Subjectwise, Sho is real serious, and similar to Willie D. He is socially aware on joints like "Trouble Man" (feat. Willie D)where he is pessimistic about the future of his life in the hood over a somber twangy beat. He gets even more somber on "Fiend In The Family." He explores he effects on drugs in society and within the social unit over a beautiful laid-back G-Funk style beat. "Mississippi" is crazy. Over a soulful backdrop, he discusses a trip to distribute drugs and has to look over his shoulder because he is on probation while leaving the state. He sadly contemplates how if something were to go wrong, it would devastate his family. "Miss Thang" has a laidback soul-inflected backdrop, and he macks to a hottie without fake flossing. He is honest and humble and even a bit vulnerable even though he is upfront about "knockin' the boots." If you are looking for a personal and sobering account of a real loc from the hood, this is it. If you are looking for crunk, party starting club hits, this ain't finna do it for ya. If you like this album, check out Willie D's Play Witcha Mama. Sho is a regular guest on that album, and the beats are better.

DJ Quik comes back in 1995 with his third album "Safe+Sound." This, arguably, is his best album. He still uses his old-school p-funk samples, but refines and matures them. His rhyming is so entertaining; he is light-hearted and funny. His high-pitched rapping voice is tight and amplifies the entertainment value of the album. This album is all G-Funk with a touch of jazz and rock & roll. This album is the one he introduces his Roger-like talkbox that would be trademark of his later work. I may not be a fan of "pimp" rhymes and constant "sex rap," as are commonplace in Quik's work, but even I am won over because he has such tight beats in those songs. He also puts in several party jams that make the album fun to listen to. He also has a few hard-core songs with awesome beats. It's a shame he is so underrated!

Quik sure gets his funk on with "Way 2 Fonky." He draws on from what made "Quik Is The Name" so great: elaborate P-Funk samples. This album may not be on the same level as his 1st, be does have surefire hits. The title track and "Amerika'z Most Complete Artist" are awesome with nice beats exploring what it takes to keep it real and funky in the rap game. "Jus Lyke Compton" is where DJ Quik synthesizes his experiences touring in other cities, and how they are not that much different from his birthplace, all over a deep bass beat with jingle bells adding to the funky feel to the song. He also has his fair share of dirty, naughty songs like "N---az Still Trippin'" and "Mo' P---y." This album is an essential addition to your G-Funk set.

1992, a year of top-quality hip-hop comin' out the east coast was the time for a neat duo, Dres and Skoob, namely Das Efx to drop their debut under the guidance of executive producers EPMD. The duo have mad skills, but are not afraid to use hip hop as a way to have fun. The hook for "Dum Dums" will prove that. It is a fun album to listen to through. I love the funky bombastic vibe of "Mic Checka" with that deep groove, twangy beat and verbal flex, and that continues on "Jussummen." I love the melodic Emotions "Blind Alley" sample (often used in east coast hip-hop) on "Klap Ya Hands." The funky sample on "Straight Out The Sewer" provides a raw soundscape for Das Efx to bring the darker street rhymes that they would continue on Straight Up Sewaside a year later. Their debut album is full of fun bouncy boom-bap beats and raw if humorous battle ready rhymes. The "diggity" phrases would be influential in other hip-hop groups of the 90's as well.

Kam, a rapper from South Central, Watts I believe, comes correct on his debut in 1993 under Ice Cube's guidance. Under a wide variety of producers, the vibe is funky, but not as much G-Funk in the vein of his 1995 album Made In America, which is some of the finest lyrical and musical G-Funk around, but this funk here on Neva Again is more raw, and some of the beats resemble underground East Coast rap. There are plenty of P-Funk samples and Zapp samples. Now in comparison to Made In America, the beats on Made... I like a little more, but as lyrical as that one was, the lyrics here are a little more heated, for Made... was a little tamer. Kam may not flow like Redman, Biggie, Guru, and the like, but he is hella lyrical. Peep his crazy take on the holidays on "Holiday Madness." He sees no point of those Eurocentric celebrations and how his folks are too broke to care. A wonderful gem here is "Still Got Love 4 'Um." He brings back memories of the homies growing up, and as their lives take different paths, and they change, he still remembers them. "Neva Again" does take more of a G-Funk vibe. The beat samples Zapp's "Heartbreaker." He takes on America and it's social innequalities and embraces Islam. He also takes on why he looks after his own people first, which is his answer to his alleged racist views, can you blame him. He may appear as racist on some joints here, but listen to his views. He is deep, and he deserves to vent his frustration with the situation in America. The beat on "Peace Treaty" is another of the few G-Funk selections here. The beat is hella phat, and almost resembles an Erick Sermon beat but west coastafied. "Stereotype" is crazy too. He takes on stereotypes of black folks. He is serious, but his bluntness can be humorous. All in all, this album is bangin' with some deep groove funk, and political and social lyrics.

I am starting my second year of formal Latin study this fall, and with the Latin textbooks I use, the vocabulary words basically make up the dictionary section in the back of the books. I came across this "dictionary" in a Barnes and Noble, a knew from skimming through this among many others that this is the ONE! As I review my notes from my first year's study over the summer, this book also has grammar references, such as verb tenses and moods, dipthongs and pronuncition of vowels and consonants, popular and lesser known Latin sayings. The book also covers woer order, adjectives, and adverbs. Oh my, the dictionary even has a Roman history timeline, a perfect refernce as a Latin major to reference and review what I learned in Roman Civilization last spring. It has a great, broad selection of words from Latin to English and then a section translating from English to Latin. This book is livin' proof that Latin is not a dead language; to me it is alive and one hella beautiful language and helps me understand my native English, and helps me with Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, languages I have some knowledge in. This dictionary also has Latin names for places formerly part of the Roman Empire, a reference for Latin Writers, and a family tree covering from trivatus, trivatia (great great great great grandfather and mother respectively); all the way to pronepos, preoneptis (great grandson, great granddaughter). Not only can you look up words you don't know, you can review grammar, history and much, much more!!! This one is a certified keeper. Librem carpe statim antequam deficiat! Get this book immediately before it runs out! Gosh, I love this language, and this reference guide.

Philadelphia seemed an impeccable and unbeatable place for soul acts in the early 1970's. Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes and Teddy Pendergrass really delivered on their 1972 debut album. Unsurprisingly, Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's production gives the group a great backdrop to sing. This album has much of that soft ballad soul that I crave (like with other artists of the time like The Delfonics, Stylistics, among others), but instead of a falsetto lead, we get the deep, gruffy, emotional, painfully beautiful crooning of Teddy Pendergrass (aka TP), while the rest of the group provides awesome harmony. The 8 1/2 minute opener, "I Miss You" is a sweet ballad to get things started. I love the heavenly chorus and uplifting vibe of "Let Me Into Your World," not only romantic, but also perfect for cruisin,'and the lyrics are poetic, comparing the lady's eyes to a "pot of gold." Realizing now that he has a woman in his life, TP feels the blues fade away and all falling into place on "Yesterday I Had The Blues." "Let It Be You" features a brief falsetto along with TP, and it is another sweet slower mid-tempo burner. "If You Don't Know Me By Now" is agreat slow jam again with goosebump inducing hook harmonizing. As a whole, we have here, a true soul album chock full of beautiful soul and no pop filler at all, all sweet balads. Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes is one classy and stylish group on top of it all. They have powerful lyrics backed by heavenly melodies; this has to be one of the best early Gamble and Huff produced albums. Thank god it is available on cd now and available to download for younger generation guys like me to enjoy and groove to because I am not feeling the RnB game today.

I am a young person who mostly likes rap, but I am trying to widen my musical tastes. Rap often samples older soul and funk. Being lost in a "shorty look good, shake it" era, I wanted to find out about real RnB from a great generation. I finally heard of the Philly soul greats, The Delfonics, and got a greatest hits comp and I was hooked. Then, I downloaded this (I know, cheap, huh), and this album is a sweet delight when i a in the mood for soul with true emotion and fantastic harmonization. William Hart really has that falsetto that will give you goosebumps. This 1968-69 album features some great slower and mid-tempo jams that will get your emotions swirling and your head nodding. Many of the joints here deal with heartbreak "Going Out Of my Head" is a cool cruisin joint. The chorus sounds so great and harmonic. "My New Love" is where a guy moves on after a tough relationship with a prior romance, and now the old one wants him back, and it's too late. The song is a slower jam with a faster paced hook. "Somebody Loves You" is simply awesome, the quintessential slow, love jam. It's songs like this that get me more deeply with older soul. "Hot Dog (I Love You So)" is more upbeat and tempo, not my fav, but still a good pick me up and still cool tune. We get another tear-jerker in "Face It Girl, It's Over" filled with deep emotional singing exploring the behavior of a girlfriend who is bored in a relationship, to the point of no repair; sad but beautiful and true. I get more goosebumps when I hear "Everytime I See My Baby" because it is such a sweet, yet sad heart breaking joint with some of the best melodies and harmonizing. "Ready Or Not, Here I Come" has fun upbeat feel to it. Anyone going retro with me will definitely love this soul classic. It is also available on a 2001 reissue. Delfonics are my favorite soul group, and that's why. Stylistics fans will probably like this album too.

1972 and 1973 were the years that the Spinners finally got the chance to breakthrough to a wide audience after years on Motown without any huge success. Now with producer/writer team Thom Bell/Linda Creed, and a deal on Atlantic, they Spinners' hard work finally paid off after years. This joint is surely a winner, with some heavy hitting mid-tempo soul jams. This one contains some legendary jams like the rolling funk of "I'll Be Around" and "Could It Be I'm Falling in Love" heavily laden with strings, a staple of Philly Soul. "I'll Be Around" is one of my favorite soul jams of all time, and even though I am 10 years younger than the song is, I remember listening to it and loving it in junior high school (in the mid 90's) when L.A. hip-hop station Power 106 FM had time set aside time for old school jams. Rapper Rappin' 4-Tay also made his own version of it in 1994, a wonderful hip-hop jam which took the funky rolling music and some of the hook vocals for the rap song. Another one of my favorites here is "Just Me and You Baby," a slower, ballad type jam with heavenly harmony. "Ghetto Child" is heavy mid-tempo jam exploring the bad side of growing up in the `hood, very sad and timeless. "How Could I Let You Get Away" is a sadder lyrically rich song laden with sitars later in the song. Phillipe Wynne, Bobbie Smith (great singers), and company surely deliver a rich album full of lush Thom Bell production and sweet harmony and melody; the transition from Detroit to Philly surely was a lucrative one. 1974's Mighty Love is another wonderful soulful album as is 1975's Pick of the Litter. The Spinners are definitely essential listening in order to truly experience what Philly Soul has to offer.

DJ Screw's older screwed material is well represented here. I am originally from Cali, so I did not grow up listening to his screw tapes. Unfortunate for me! But this 3 disc set displays his talent to slow up songs, and from H-Town and southern rap of today, it's easy to see his influence live on. Now, West Coast and Midwestern often get chopped and screwed. On 11-16-00, Screw screws Songs like Marvaless' "Jealous Bitches" which becomes "Drama" here, "187 Skillz" by ESG, which becomes "Bow Down" here. Screw fixes up Sean T's "Top Notch," which becomes "Everybody Gonna Do The Same," and South Circle's classic joint "Everyday Allday,"which becomes "Southside On Choppers." He even screws the beat of Nas' If I Ruled The World [Imagine That]" on "Blowing Big" but incorporating southside lyrics instead of the original Nas ones. Many scewed beats have the original artists' lyrics, but some have different lyrics added. Here you get a nice taste of the talent that is DJ Screw. RIP to a legend I am now finally starting to recognize as a great part of hip hop history, better late than ever for me, right?

Baby Gangster BG from New Orleans comes thru again on his 4th album, late 1997's It's All On U Vol.2, his 3rd album in a year's span! Dude been hella busy in 1996 and 1997! U may think, it has to be rushed with all those albums all in a year. I have to say, this album rocks. Mannie Fresh has so much funk in his blood; his beats bang one after another with that southern fried flava with a rattling sophistication that many other producers drew upon in the late 1990's. "Livin' Legend" is a hot one, cementing BG as a legend in the rap game over a melodic, twangy G-Funk inspired beat. He may get flossy and hot headed like many, but his voice, flow, and delivery are interesting and unique. "I'm Try'n" shows BG trying to keep his head up, survive, and make his bank over a funky guitar ridden beat. "What U Want Do" gets it crunk with a neat rattling beat. Another G-Funk inspired scorcher is "Plan Went Sour" where BG hustles and gets his grind on over a tight twangy laid back beat. Hustler anthems are hardly new in 1997, but BG's song is tight with dope production! Make sure to check Chopper City from early 1997 and It's All On U Vol.1 from half a year after that and before this one. All came out with only a few months between them, but all are hella dope. 1 Luv Mannie Fresh, BG and the Cash Money crew for a dope 1997, a underrated, yet awesome year for underground hip-hop.

1971, The Stylistics,a legendary Philly soul group drops the debut, a 9 track classic full of wonderful harmony-driven soul from the center of the heart. Russel Thompkins Jr. has one of the coolest, goosebump inducing fasetto voices around (like The Delfonics' William Hart, it digs deep down in you and evokes a lotta emotion. My first musical love is rap and hip-hop (I am considerably younger: mid 20's), but since I have expolred some of these old-school treasures, I am really getting into soul music with a passion. My favorite joint here is "You Are Everything" (one of my favorite soul songs of all time). It has such an airy, heavenly feel to it, and I like how the verses build up to great chorus and sweet harmonizing. "You Make Me Feel Brand New" and "Betcha By Golly Wow" do the same exact thing; I get goosebumps evertime I hear them and repeat them time after time. There is real emotion behind these songs. "Ebony Eyes" has a cool funky vibe with a small guitar twang. Russel hits some high notes from time to time. "If I Love You" has such an exciting upbeat vibe, and is a great mood lifter. I love the nice, funky rolling beat of "You're A Big Girl Now." The song deals with a young love interest coming of age. "People Make The World Go Round" has a neat socio-political edge with a sweet funk-soul beat, and Russel really hits the right notes in the chorus and hook. I cannot sing enough praise for this early 70's gem. I recommend that any youngster get up on what real soul music is all about.

1998, Houston's Black Monks drop No Mercy, a long-awaited folow-up to 1994's Secrets Of The Hidden Temple. Now what distinguishes this album from Secrets..., is the production. Both albums have neat and original lyricism, but No Mercy has much better production. The beats are smoother and more melodic. John Bido, Wendell Springer, Pedewestra, Jerry Muhammad, and Itche all produce some phat beats. Lyrically, these cats, 3-2, AWOL, Raheem, D.A., and Storm drop more of those jungle style metaphors and make the album interesting. "Jungle Funk" is a nice, fun, bouncy G-Funk joint perfect for lowriding. The laidback "Natural Herbs & Spices" is phenomenal. The vibe is relaxed; the beat is so laidback and cool, it deserves classic status by the beat itself. It reminds me of G-Funk from a few years before (mid-90's). Another G-Funk scorcher is "Paper Chase" which is fun to listen to, and definitely stands among the best among southern rap joints. "Steppin With Your Weapon" is also phat; the beat slaps with that southern-fried funk with some gangstafied spits. Can you imagine a gorilla splittin wigs? Well, here, you can! If you want an album with some different imagery and lyricism and great beats, look no further.

This 1995 single is one sick banger. Erick Sermon's beat for the original song (LP version from The Show soundtrack) is deep groove funk, and the remix is even funkier. The remix has a radio edit. There is an acapella (unfortunatelly edited though) at the end; to really appreciate Meth and Red's lyrical skills, listen to the acapella closely. They both have a gruff and grimy flow, trade off back and forth in each verse, and display great chemistry. Erick Sermon really took his board skills to the max here. East Coast heads already have it, but even west coast heads will appreciate the funkiness of the vibes and references to smokin.'

Domino came out of the Long Beach scene early before the mid 90's blow up of artists like Warren G, Dove Shack, Twinz, Foesum, etc. It came out close to when Snoop's explosive solo debut, Doggystyle, came out. Domino's main known jam was "Getto Jam," definitely a classic with a raw but slick G-Funk beat and eerie, haunting, ghostly keyboard riffs, but smmoth rap/singing. He does sing, and decently well, and he can rap too. He balances both throughout the album, as he will do in subsequent albums. Battlecat handles most of the production, and he does it well. The beats are well suited for 1993, G-Funk with a raw edge; though "Raincoat" is soulful, warning those not hip to using protection while having sex. "Long Beach Thang" is what it is, a nice bouncy anthem for the famous city. All in all, a decent album with nice production.

CMDubb's 3rd album, Music To Driveby is easily one of the top albums of the early 90's, thumpin beats and awesome rhymes. DJ Slip, Unknown, and DJ Mike T serve the beats in different flavas, raw, smooth, funky, melodic , jazzy (at times), and hella funky! Productionwise, this is one of the best albums of 1992, in my opinion. All three layer soul and funk samples one on top of another and Mike T dices and scratches them up with precision. Musically, this album resembles a West Coast DJ Premier of Gangstarr. Here in 1992, West Coast and East Coast beats diverge musically, and G-Funk was starting to pop up in West Coast albums. This album shows those tendencies while remaining raw at the same time. MC Eiht is game tight throughout the album. He can hold his own, and he gets hard on DJ Quik (who to be fair, I am a big fan of too)on the short "Who's Xxxxing Who?" and "Duck Sick 2," the latter is a funky classic. I love the Issac Hayes "Walk On By" sample by Slip on the melodic "Hood Took Me Under," an absolute classic where CMW shoots game about the trappings of the hood. Another classic is "N 2 Deep" with Mr. Scarface, another one of my favorite rappers; they both serve heat over a soulful funky beat. I love "This Is A Gang" which beautifully samples the beat sequence and hook of NWA's 1988 classic "Compton's In The House," and Slip adds a soft funky flute to add to the effect. This album sets a high standard for West Coast rap and often takes a back seat to other West Coast albums like The Chronic. It should not be overlooked.

The Comrads' debut is loaded with those west coastin' beats so hard, they'll knock the pictures off people's walls as you roll down the street. The album is loaded with hard rhymes, and bangin beats. The track "Homeboys" is a prime example. K-Mac and Gangsta's rhymes are on point, and the beat is hard knock. The album offers great rhymes, awesome tunes, and something for the player or party in you ("Hey You" "Call Me") Gangster in you ("Bustas" "Die Hard" "B----- Made N----"). and the hustler in you ("Big Ballers"). The production is tight on the album. The album is perfect for the lowrider.

The Comrads' single "Homeboyz" hits hard with a bangin, bass heavy window shakin beat and dope rhymes about stickin' together and ballin' together. It's a slammin track to roll up the avenue to! As they holla in the hook,"You can take the boy out the hood, but you can't take the hood out the homeboy." Peep serious westcoast game 'n copp dis one! In fact, you should get the whole album cuz there are a lot more bangin tracks on it!

Pooh-Man came out with furor in this 1994 set. He may not have the best flow in rap, but he does paint you a nice picture of gangbanger life. My favorite track is "Just Another Drive By," where he represents the gutter mentality of Killa Cali. Take the album for what it is, mid 90's Gangsta rap over twangy G-Funk beats. The beats are awesome. Too bad, Pooh-Man had a falling out with Ant Banks and Too Short; they would have all collabo'd awesome on this set, possibly making it a big classic. Still, it is a tight mid-90's album.

I am relatively young, for I was born the decade after the Main Ingredient became popular, but as I explore the great soul groups of the 60's and 70's, I continually come upon groups that enthuse me: The Main Ingredient is one of them for sure. Their harmony is flawless and airy, a heavenly ensemble. Before purchasing this comp, I previously bought their Stevie Wonder tribute album, 1973's Aphrodisiac and was taken aback by their sultry grooves and great melodic songs, so I wanted to delve deeper into their discog. The Everybody Plays the Fool: The Best of... for me is a great start because it has the obvious hit: Everybody Plays the Fool (1971-72), one of my favorite soul grooves, a mid tempo,melody driven classic. It also has some fantastic ballads from the early to mid 70's such as 1974's "Let Me Prove My Love to You" (1975), a heavily doo-wop influenced song with high, heavenly harmony, and the even more airy, 1971's "Spinning Around;" check the unbelievable chorus on this one! We get songs here from when Donald McPherson (RIP) and when Cuba Gooding were heading the group. Many of the Stevie Wonder tributes are here, including "Super Woman," and "Girl Blue," which are fantastic 1973 re-makes of Wonder's 1972 songs from Music From My Mind. The Main Ingredient make the songs their own by re-injecting the grooves with their own heavenly styles. We do get some more upbeat jams like "Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing" (1974),and other good re-makes such as their interpretation of Blue Magic's "I Just Don't Want to Be Lonely." I am upset that the cd reissues of most of their albums such as 1972's Bittersweet and 1971's Spinning Around, and L.T.D. (1970) are extremely rare and or non-existent because they would sound so good in my car and in my home right now. But, at least us newbies have this compilation to keep us company. I truly enjoy having been introduced to such a fantastic group even it nearly 30 years late.

Zapp's 4th record is slammin. It includes one of my favorite songs of all time: "Computer Love" which includes the lovely voice of Shirley Murdock and the Gap Band's Charlie Wilson. That song is a perennial classic and is lifts your spirits because it is so upbeat and fresh. Other funky, great tracks include "Radio People," "It Doesn't Really Matter," and "Itchin For Your Twitchin." These songs alone give it The New Zapp IV U a 5 star rating. These old school jams stand the test of time. Just see how many rappers sampled Zapp's work in the last 15 years or so! It's great party music. RIP Roger

In late 1996 Snoop finally releases his 2nd album, Tha Doggfather, after beating a murder rap. Unfortunately, this album was slept on compared to 1993's Doggystyle. You hear much more about Doggystyle than this. Now, this one does not touch Doggystyle, but you need to give it a chance. Some of the album will have to grow on you as it did on me, but it does have some classic joints. Daz, DJ Pooh, LT Hutton, Soopafly, Arkim and Flair, Mark Freeman, Dave Aron, and Sam Sneed all create some interesting beats. My favorite is "Up Jump Tha Boogie" where Snoop gets it crunk over a bouncy DJ Pooh lowrider beat and a talk box. Pooh's beat on "Snoop Bounce" uses a Zapp sample and is perfect for the house party. There is some good old G-Funk on tracks like "2001" and the funny and raunchy "Groupie" with Warren G, Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg, and Gap Band's Charlie Wilson. The beat is melodic and laidback courtesy of Daz. The song reminds me of a part 2 of "Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)." "Tha Doggfather" has more of a mainstream appeal but is hot with a bouncy party beat and Charlie Wilson singing the hook. There are some odd selections here though. The beat is out of place and wack on "(O.J.) Wake Up;" it samples a Run DMC beat, but it does not feel right here though; I just cannot get into it. "Gold Rush" has a weird beat, sort of like a Wild West theme, but it is likeable however after a few listens. "Doggyland" is hot. It has a nice, twangy G-Funk beat and is upbeat, definitely one of Snoop's best songs perfectly laidback and fits his lyrical style perfectly. "You Thought" is a Soopafly banger, with Soopafly, Snoop and Too Short trading pimped out verses over a Zoot Suit Riot old-school style beat. Definitely an album worth checking out. Give it a chance.

Scarface comes out hard on his 1997 set, The Untouchable. This may not be his best, or best known work, but it is solid. He often continues his simplistic, but bumpin bass-heavy G-Funk beats with hard core rhymes. The title track is tight. The beat is sparse, but he features Roger Troutman (RIP) singing "Untou - chable, oh dear baby" with his trademark talk box (similar to, but slower than Zapp's "So Ruff, So Tuff"). "Money Makes the World Go Round" is an outstanding cut featuring Daz Dillinger and Devin The Dude. It's a twangy, deep groove G-Funk selection with a more sustantive beat than many of the others. The album is a nice addition to either your G-Funk set, your Dirty South set, or just your rap collection.

A-G-2-A-Ke comes out real hard and hungry on their first release, 1998's Mil-Ticket on Rap-A-Lot Records. Let me say, it is awesome! These guys put Mil Town, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the map. These guys let it be know that they are hustlers; they get their grind on thru the whole album. Productionwise, this album stomps hard with a mix of laid back G-Funk and rattlin and bass heavy midwestern funk, sometimes meshing with a nice southern influence due to the label being a southern empire. The beats are awesome, mostly handled by 88 Keys, a few by Scarface (Brad Jordan, namely the ones he appears on), and Mike Dean adds a litle somethin too. The lyrics are hardcore and raw throughout, even though they light up a J on "R U High Yet?" with Yukmouth over a relaxed G-Funk beat perfect to slide n glide to. They also reminisce about one of the homies on "C-Lo" over a serious, whiny relaxed beat. These cats get a litle flossy on the laid back "Big Balla Society" over a twangy G-Funk style beat. A-G-2-A-Ke gets cautionary on "Tommorow Ain't Promised" and "Can't Nobody Change This" all over nice melodic beats, the former produced by Face. Now, these cats can rap a different speeds, from normal to fast like many midwestern rappers do, and each has his own flow; G-Mone and Mac Fee spit venom throughout. "Cocaine" is menacing with a bit about how drugs rule the game and the hood; you can also find this track on Scarface's 1998 album/compilation My Homies, also a recommended listen. I believe they have a second album, Ball $treet from 2001, but I know little about this one; it seems rare and expensive. It could be good, but I have never heard it yet. But as for Mil Ticket, definitely support the Rap-A-Lot legacy and scope up this slept on classic; this album did not garner a 5 star train for no reason!!!

Texas' own legend Roy Orbison makes some great music, hence the simple title of my review. I have just started listening to Roy Orbison just over a month ago. I am in my 20's and I love oldies, especially doo-wop, Motown and Philly Soul. I have heard of Orbison before, but previously never heard any of his songs. I heard his 1963 "In Dreams" song on an oldies channel, and really dug it. I decided to check out some of his other music. I love early 60's music, and I have music like his to thank. I came across this album here on Amazon, and bought it without even sampling any of his songs, something I usually do not do. I totally have fallen in love with this music. He has a deep fantastic voice and it shows throughout this 1960 debut album. Most songs I believe are originals (I am not crazy about covers unless they are done differently and originally). Most are written by Orbison, Joe Melson, with a couple others like Boudleaux and Felice Bryant contributing a song, with a few Don Gibson covers. The emotion and passion in his voice make this album top rate. The first song is the awesome mid tempo "Only The Lonely" starts off with the cool refrains (dum dum dum duddley doo wah); I love rock and doo-wop refrains. The strings add an cool dimension to the music. Roy Orbison is great at singing heartbreak songs, and he truly shines here. One other classic is "Blue Angel;" this song also has the refrains (dooby wah's and etc), and is wonderful. He talks to a lovely woman who has been heartbroken, and he tells her to forget him and join him, he who will treat him much better. "Raindrops" is an earlier song, from 1959, and is cool. it has a little folksier edge to it, and again draws upon the theme of heartbreak. This album is a perfect means of catharsis for those who are heartbroken. Don Gibson's "Can't Stop Loving You" is executed perfectly, which was also covered by Ray Charles in 1962; both Orbison's cover and Charles' versions are enchanting. he also gives Gene Pitney's "22 Days" a classy treatment. There are 4 bonus tracks here, two of which are Orbison originals recordere also in 1959. "Uptown" has the bluesy doo-wop vibe, and "Pretty One" is a slow, sweet ballad, which is a treasure. I highly recommend that fans of good music who do not already have this pick it up now. Roy Orbison represents everything that I love about music from this time period, and from music in general. Also recommended, his 1962 album Crying is also excellent, and has even more original Orbison material (less covers). he is the epitome of late 50's and early 60's rock music, a style of music I fall in love with more and more each day I hear great music like this.

MC Eiht goes "solo" in 1994 (the CMW name is attached to his on the album cover), with We Come Strapped, and what a year to release an album out west, east, or anywhere for that matter. DJ Slip produces some real gems here, often with a stripped down forebeat and a melodic backdrop, and the formula works very well. The beats have a raw, yet musically beautiful sound to them at the same time. "All For The Money" is one of the mellowest rap jams I ever heard employing a Tyrone Davis "In The Mood" (1979) sample. "Compton Cyco" is the opposite with a stripped down beat, and a harsh flow by an angry Eiht. The beat is adrenaline paced, a drive-by soundtrack. "Def Wish" is where he gets hard on DJ Quik (another rapper I enjoy listening to); it seems this beef gets lost among the higher-profile beefs like Pac v. BIG, Jay-Z v Nas, etc, but Quik and Eiht's beef was mad heated in its own right. One of my fav's here is "Nuthin' But The Gangsta" feat. Spice 1 and Redman. All deliver harsh flows, and Redman steals the show starting his verse by "Check it out;/Oh my god,/ I destroy cities like the blob." Redman adds a rough tongued east coast New Jerz flava to this raw g-funk track. "Can I Still Kill It?" is a mellow g-funk jam about sex, and the beat is hot. He fully represents his Compton roots on the whole album, especially over the RnB flavored mellow beat of "Compton Bomb." On the whole, this is a wonderful album full of a hard core Eiht over interestingly mellow beats. The beats reflect the g-funk tendencies of the west coast in 1994, but are distinct, have their own flavor, and are very original. DJ Slip has his own style and stays true to it; he and Eiht have awesome chemistry and it shows here. 1996's Death Threatz has more of that chemistry and is an essential west coast record too.

B-Legit finally answers after a few year hiatus following 1996's classic Hemp Museum with it's apparent sequel, 2000's Hempin' Ain't Easy. I believe that this album was supposed to be released late 1998 or sometime in 1999, as it has a 98-99 feel to it. It was apparently pushed back much to the detriment of its sales. It is a dope album, not as good as Hemp Museum, but it has some gems here. The album is full of that Northern Cali Mobb music that makes the bay area so awesome. Production slaps and is held by Sam Bostic, Tone Capone, Studio Ton, Ant Banks, Meech Wells, and a few lesser known beatsmiths. I like the woozy synth driven, bouncy mobbster, wreckless livin' joint "Hard Head N---a." "Rap Star" features Little Bruce and has a semi-crunk vibe, and the 2 get they floss on with hunnys draped over them livin' the good life. B lights a fat J on "Blaze It" over a twangy, bouncy beat only he can rap over! One of my fav's (if not, my favorite together) is the south-west collabo on "I'm Dying With Mine" featuring Lil' Keke and Archie Lee of the Texas group Herschelwood Hard Heads. The beat is a sophisticated G-Funk scorcher with a nice range of laidback keyboard melodies. All 3 get their grind on with relentless spits. I also like Bosko's lowrider beat on "It's In The Game." Kurupt and Mack 10 show up on the L.A. lowrider style "Where The Gangstas At." Overall, B-Legit does real good with quality, just not so in sales, for this album is hardly ever spoken of; what a shame. If it were released on time, it may have done better in sales.

DJ Yella from NWA finally comes out with his own album "One Mo N---- Ta Go" in 1996. The only real problem with this album is that it has way too many interludes and not enough songs. Other than that, the album is a great tribute to his dear friend Eric "Eazy-E" Wright 1963-1995 RIP. The album is often heartbreaking, and at times really sad, because he speaks so highly of his friend that he lost to AIDS. Yella puts so much passion into honoring his late friend in songs like "4 Tha E" featuring Kokane. His beats are smooth, laid back G-Funk which are refreshing breaks from the seeming endless selections of hard core beats that prevailed in 1996. One song, "Send 4 Me, with the lovely voice of Traci Nelson, is not even a rap song at all, but an excellent R&B track. He also has a good rapping voice. It's too bad he didn't come out with more albums!

Come on, no reviews for this one??? The Delfonics do it again on their 1974 Alive & Kicking. I have heard and read that this album lacks the magic of their earlier late 60's early 70's albums. I will be honest; this album cannot touch La La Means I Love You (1968), Delfonics (1970), or Tell Me This is a Dream (1972), my fav 3 albums by them, but as usual there is some real magic on this album, and to be really honest again, Alive and Kicking is not that far behind them. There are some surefire classics on here. A hit, "Think It Over" is one for sure. William Hart belts out a tune about advising his boo to think before she acts and leaves the relationship, a beautiful soft number. I love the string laden, rolling funkiness of "First Thing on My Mind," again with Hart's tender falsetto, and the sweet harmonies on the hooks and bridges. Wilburt Hart also takes the leads with his rich voice on the hippie/flower child influenced innocent number "Pardon Me Girl;" I love the soft sitars and sweet strings and harmony. "Love is" also has a similar vibe with a groove hook I dare anyone not to move to. William Hart takes the lead again on "Start All Over Again." This number is a slow drag ballad which brings back the memories and magic of the earlier classics, and is one of my favorite Delfonics songs. "Can't Go On Living" has the strings and vibes reminiscent of a late 60's song, and is another winner: I believe it is Major Harris doing the lead vocals here, and the vocals are smooth as butter. As I type my review I am loving it even more before I had started reviewing it. This one may need a little more time to grow on you, but best believe me it will. This is another great Delfonics album, and is the last album that would spawn the big hits for them unfortunately, since they are an awesome group.

Major Harris releases his debut album My Way in 1974-75. He has a cool vibin' voice and flows easy over the melody: no wonder why the Delfonics had him join them in the early 70's after Randy Cain (R.I.P.) left. Here, he gets some solo shine and makes a wonderful record with different tempos and styles. The hit single: "Love Won't Let Me Wait" is a cool-vibin, jazzy, classy number, with some orgasmic girl moans at the end of the slow drag. "Sideshow" is a mellow cover of a Blue Magic classic jam, and Major Harris handles it well. Other slower jams include "Just a Thing I Do" and "My Way." The other songs are more up-tempo and also are spirit and soul up-lifters. "Sweet Tomorrow" is gorgeous, poetic, and romantic. The swinging vibe of "Loving You Is Mellow" with the heavenly chorus chants is another mood lifter. All the songs on My Way are great: Major Harris has a great voice. Anyone who loves anything from Motown to Philly Soul and even softer Disco will love this wonderful album.

Eightball finally releases a solo debut in 1998 with Lost. Suave Records released classic after classic in the 1990's, and even though this 2 disc set does have some filler (esp. in the second disc), there are so many dope joints still warranting a 5 star review. The production is hella phat with that smooth suave flava. What else you expect with a Suave record? Ball holds his own on the mic and his southern drawl and dope flow complement the beats well. There is a 3rd bonus disc with some Suave affiliated acts and underground homies, but I rarely listen to it, but it is o.k. As for the album, "My Homeboy's Girlfriend" is a dope story where his homie's girlfriend hits on him and they do it. He contemplates what's gonna go down if homey finds out. He tells a good story here. The beat is jazzy and sweet. "Stompin' And Pimpin'" is a sick space-boogie inflected G-Funk banger and MJG and Ball flex they mackin.' "Put Tha House" has a smooth overture too, with a Spanish guitar and a semi boom-bap like beat. He lets it be known that he can't be messed with with some harsh flows. Ball gets deep on joints like "If I Die" with a beautiful, if gloomy, keyboard ridden G-Funk beat. He wants the relentless hood cycle and mentality to stop. "Get Money" has an upbeat vibe to it and more of a mainstream feel with Busta Rhymes stoppin by and kickin some flows with 8Ball. I do not know if they work too well together, but the beat is cool. As for disc 2, there is more filler like the cool reggae vibin', but lyrically unneccesary "My First Love." Then he returns with a gangsta banger, "Get Bucked," with a classic, space boogie beat. "360" is a sick west-south collabo with E-40, Rappin' 4-Tay, Spice 1 and RnB hooksters Otis and Shug (I love those type of collabos), and the beat is produced by the legendary bay beatsmith, Ant Banks. The beat is vintage bay area, and all spit serious game. "Ball and Bun" is a sick rock n roll inflected banger with 8Ball and Bun B of U.G.K. kickin some mobbin street flava. "Coffee Shoppe" features Redman, who I am also a fan of. The simplistic beat is not my favorite, but both really spit hard here. A cool party joint with a nice lowrider G-Funk beat is "Put Your Hands Up" with homie MJG. "This Is Dedicated" is so smooth the disc may slip out the player. Phoenix Johnson gives some silky, sexy hook vocals, and Ball gets deep on the mic again droppin' philosophy. All in all, with a few fillers, this album is an essential for any hip-hop, rap head. The production is second to none, and 8Ball keeps droppin' sick rhymes. This rivals many of 8ball and MJG's duo classics too.

This is CCR's first album from 1968, an album full of raw, down home, bluesy and countrified harder rock music that made me a fan of theirs. This is also the first album of theirs I ever listened to. The album has much more cover material than their other albums, but their covers are performed with precision, and of course, John Fogerty wrote most of the rest of the material, which is of course, awesome. As for the covers, "Susie Q" (Dale Hawkins) stands out as an 8 1/2 minute epic, a great treatment of a classic rock jam from 11 years prior. The original material to me is the best, and shows the accomplished composer/writer John Fogerty was and that there was promise of even better songs ahead in CCR's tenure in the music world. "The Working Man" is a driving blues-rock number with witty lyrics about growing up quick to make it on in the world alone, and upping status in life on one's own accord: "I don't mess around with magic child; what I got is mine" I love the " don't take me on Friday Lord cuz that's when I get paid" and if it is his time to go to take him "on Saturday night" before "Sunday get [his] head." All in all, a fun listen. "Get Down Woman" is a straight blues-rock jam about a woman who isn't acting right with her man. "Porterville" is a relic of a song. It is from 1967 when CCR was called the Golliwogs. It is a nice swamp rock jam. "Gloomy" is as close as CCR ever approached to doing psychedelic rock (remember, this IS 1968, the head of the psychedelic era), for it has some trippy sound effects. I love the instrumentation and guitar use through this jam. "Walking on the Water" is a classic CCR song with its again down home musicianship. The lyrics are mystical and at time fantastical, and beautiful. "Call It Pretending" has more of a Stax Southern Soul late 60's feel to it, with call and response vocals, and shows CCR's ability to do Rhythm and Blues style music more than proficiently. This re-issue has a couple of bonus tracks, like "before You Accuse Me," which is found on 1970's Cosmo's Factory, a driving bluesy rocker. There is also a 1969 live nearly 12 minute rendition of "Susie Q." I thank this album for showing how great a band CCR is. I ended up purchasing all their other albums right after this one. This album shows a band evolving from cover songs to mature song writing, and their ability to create different atmoshperes of music, which I call well-roundedness. To me, this album has just about everything I like about Rock and Roll.

Roger is the epitome of funk. He always has tight beats you can lowride to, just chill out to, and dance to! His use of the talk box is a big part of what makes him interesting and fun to listen to. Along with George Clinton Jr. and Funkadelic, Roger and Zapp are the essential godfathers of the G-Funk movement in the 90's hip hop scene. So many rappers adopted the style of beats and the use of the talk box. Rappers like DJ Quik, Dr. Dre, 2Pac, and even Redman in his first album in '92, among many others were influenced by Roger Troutman. In fact, Roger makes appearances in 2Pac's "California Love." Roger's funky mix of funk, soul, pop, and R&B is a fantastic way to get you pumped up. This compilation could've used a few more tracks, but overall, it is a good showcase of, or introduction to, Roger's style. It helped get me more into him, especially with me being primarily a rap fan and not a fan of much else!

The Temptations' first album from 1964 is a wonderful "introduction" to an extremely talented group whose star was about to be on a vertical rise in the coming years. The truth is that the Temps have been releasing singles since 1960 or 1961 (to my knowledge), and this album features some of their earliest group songs. Berry Gordy handles a lot of the composition as he did on many of the earlier Motown groups at the time. Since most of the songs precede 1964, there is a heavy Doo-Wop sound, for the group's early sound was indeed deep rooted in harmony call and response, such a sound heavily influencing their later records in the mid and even late 60's. "The Way You Do the Things You Do" IS from 1964, and has that upbeat mid 60's style tempo and is an uplifting song. Eddie Kendrick's lead falsetto is wonderful here. One of my favorites here is the upbeat "Paradise:" one other song comes to mind while hearing this song: "Sherry Baby" from the Four Seasons, but the Temptations' song, as similar as the tempo and tone may be, is a beautiful original: Melvin Franklin's Bass opens up the song, and Eddie leads this beautiful doo wop winner. Eddie also leads "May I Have This Dance" but in a slightly lower tenor. It is a humble, classy, charming, and innocent song about getting with a love interest. Paul Williams really rocks on "Farewell My Love," and as with any other Temp who takes lead, he handles it with easy finesse, and he shares some leads with again wonderful Eddie. Eddie again leads on the slow drag ballad "Dream Come True" with dreamy doo wop harmonies and sweet strings and easy tempo. There are a few faster tempo songs with a rock `n roll flair: "Romance Without Finance" from circa 1961, a cool jam, and others like "Isn't She Pretty" have a faster tempo. The minor drawback of this album is the lack of two gorgeous doo-wop ballads, the heart wrenching "Tear Stained Letter," and the sad-then-hopeful "My Pillow," but back then LP's had limited time space I guess. Whatever; this early collective of fine Temptations' songs is more than worth its weight in any precious stone and is priceless in my opinion.

1998, Nate Dogg drops a double disc of game, G-Funk Classics Vol. 1 & 2. Now, there is a sad history of this album. Nate Dogg Was supposed to release disc 1 "Ghetto Preacher" around 96, and Death Row shelved it until 1997 as G-Funk Classics Vol.1 and was never successful since G-Funk lost it's commercial heat even though it was still hot, in my opinion. It seems that the industry was in line for the next fad, Puff Daddy and the East Coast late 90's revival. Hip Hop constantly evolves, so G-Funk went more underground. Disc 2, "The Prodigal Son" was made in 98 and was released with disc one. I love Nate's soulful voice, and his music runs a fine line between G-Funk (since there are some rappers here with him)and R&B soul. Both discs are great, but I like Disc 1 a tad more. "First We Pray" features Kurupt's firey flows and is hella gangsta over a sweet lowrider beat. "Bag O' Weed" with Tray Deee is fun and funky. Nate, Tray wanna hook up with some honies and hopes they bring the wine as he gets the dank. Nate is real playa, pimp, reflective, and can be socially aware on this one. "Who's Playin' Games" from disc 2 is cool with a nice cooing by Nate over a bouncy beat. He exercises and flexes his swinging personality and analyzes a player's ways from back in the day. Nate, Warren G, and Snoop takes a look at trusting friends as they evolve and grow up, but you can see that Warren G, Snoop and Nate (213) stayed true to each other. The beat is relaxed and sunny. "Hardest Man In Town" from disc 1 is hard with a dope whiny synth, and Nate Dogg personifies himself as a gun. "Me & My homies" from disc 1 is also a classic. The beat is sunny and laidback. Nate and 2Pac spit about why they put their truest homies so high on their priorities. "Dogg Pound Gangstaville" (disc 2) is twangy and has a neat, original beat, and Snoop and Kurupt come by to spit some gangsta game. "Crazy, Dangerous" (disc 1)fateures a Nate and Nancy Fletcher duet over a slow twangy southern-fried inspired beat. "G-Funk" from disc 1 is what it is, twangy, deep groove funk about Nate's style, a classic. There are cool R&B/Soul joints like "It's Goin' Down Tonight," and "Almost In Love" without any rappers or rap inflence. There are way too many songs to review, but this album is definitely worth the high cost it is now commanding now since it is out of print. Nate Dogg has style and a cool swagger, and he employs his homies, fellow Long Beach rappers. Too bad, he never had the chance to blow up as a solo artist.

213 takes a trip back a decade to re-visit that G-Funk sound that was popular in the 90's, and they do it well! They do this in opposition of most rappers' tendencies to go bubblegum pop style in 2004. Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg,and Warren G have great chemistry and still use that same reminiscent lyrical style that made them popular way back then. The beats are G-Funk, reminiscent of the old-school, yet updated enough for the 21st century. One track really stands out: "Appreciation" it has a nice, bass heavy beat with faint use of the whiny, whistly keyboard synthesizer in the hooks reminiscing of 1990's hip-hop. The lyrics are superior; they give love to those that have helped them grow as people and artists. Nate Dogg's R&Bish hooks sound tight on each song. Don't sleep on this one!!!!!!!

I do not have any other albums by this hip-hop crew besides this 1992 trunk thumper and their follow-up Nuttin' But Love (1994). I am aware that Heavy D and the group make a lotta songs for the honeys with smooth production to back them up. I gotta say this bangs. It has a neat mix of smooth jams for the honeys and some raw, heated joints. We have some heavy weight producers here such as Premier, Pete Rock (two of my favorites), and Tony Dofat, and Jesse West. They produce a wonderful array of bass heavy boom bap. Heavy D really rips the tracks with his butta flow. A raw joint is "Talk Is Cheap" where he rips hard into cats talkin' ish with an aggressive flow and tone. He does have moments of bragadoccio on "Who's In The House" over jazz-horn laced Dofat banger beat. Pete Rock laces a mad heavy, jazzy atmosphere in the slick "Love Sexy." This jam is cool to cruise to while flossin' in ya whip. TRhe beat is among some of Pete's finer works, and that says a lot knowing his discog. Pete Rock does it again in the stripped down drum heavy "It's A New Day," where D and the Boyz touch on the day to day life in the hood. "A Buncha N-----" is a phat, raw posse cut with Busta Rhymes, Notorious BIG (his verse is killer here, listen to him flow), Guru from Gangstarr, 3rd Eye, and Rob-O. They all flex their battle skills and flows. Blue Funk shows a side of the group in that they can be versatile and discuss issues about life and the cycle of violence in the hood without (glorifying it). Anyone sleeping on them because they mae love/sex joints should not. This is a fine golden era classic from NYC.

In early 1995, King Tee releases an album full of real hip-hop flava. He is from Compton, Cali, and represents L.A. as hard as any other west coaster, but the musical vibes are different than your typical mid-90's Cali G-Funk. The beats are straight raw and funky boom-bap, so it will appeal to east coast and underground heads, but west coast heads wil find familiarity in his Cali reppin' and terminology in gangsta joints like "Down A-- Loc". The beats are real cool and will blow ya speakers. He can also flow and spit along with the best of the east coast rappers and has a cool mic personality. "Dippin'" is a cool Four Tops sample with nice east coast bass. The joint is a cool cruisin anthem. The remix at the end of the album has a more west coast G-Funk feel, but the keyboards and loops still have an east coast. Cali heads will love the beat to the remix because the beat has a relaxed and sunnier atmosphere. "Super N---a" has a funny Richard Pryor sample of the same name and DJ Pooh and Rashad (from the Boogiemen)create a beat simialr to Wu Tang style only less dark. Rashad, Pooh, and Tee flaunt their slick flows while pullin wack MC's hoe cards. "3 Strikes Ya Out" takes on California's 3 Strikes law and legal system and how blacks suffer worst with it. The beat reminds me of something Erick Sermon would produce for Keith Murray to rap over: raw and heavy. The beat, however, was produced by TR The Funk Ignitor and Big Moe X. "Free Style Ghetto" is a nice melodic boom-bap joint featuring Xzibit, MC Breeze, and the Alkaholiks all forming a posse spittin' flows of relentless game. "Check The Flow" definitely rocks showcasing Tee's battle rap skills and will also get the party going with an old school Big Daddy Kane sample. "Duck" is hard and street, a perfect driveby or 211 joint with a heavy bass beat by King Tee and DJ Broadway. I will admit, the G-Funky "Dippin' Remix" was the one that got me hooked into buying it, but I will say I definitely dig the deep-groove boom-bap east coast vibe of the rest of the album, and this album is one of those slept-on gems that any serious head will need to check out before it sells for 100 bucks or more soon enough. Anyone from NYC to L.A. will find a lot to love about King Tee, his NY flow, West Coast mentality, and the rich beats will get anyone hooked.

R.B.L. spit nothin' but game in this album. The beats are phenomenal, especially the first 5 tracks, which are some of the tightest beats I ever heard in rap history! If you love music to bend corners or lowride to, this is a must. The beats and rhymes are menacing and hard, showing these guys are nothing to mess with. This is the epitome of Cali gangsta rap!

The Miracles had been around since the 50's and made 2 decades worth of great music together before Smokey left for his solo career. One of their earliest released songs is 1959's "Bad Girl" a beautiful and rich doo-wop song. Their full debut album, 1961's Hi, We're The Miracles is a great, harmony-driven set of doo-wop style soul. Smokey Robinson handles a lot of the songwriting and of course, singing in his trademark falsetto. A sad slower paced love lost joint, "Who's Lovin' You" rings true for all who have messed up in a relationship and regret it. My main jam is the lyrically rich metaphor filled, upbeat, string laden "Way Over There." The complex string arrangement here is simply marvelous as is the cool vibe of the song and lyrics. A cool joint is "Won't You Take Me Back" is a nice, guitar ridden, slow rolling joint with a nice doo-wop style harmony. Another wonderful doo-wop song here is the "After All" lead by Smokey's wife Claudette, and she handles her own extremely well here! Of course, the most famous joint here is the fast paced "Shop Around," which is still heard today on retail store commercials. Of course, the song is not about literally shopping; it deals with keeping your options open in love before committing and settling down. Make sure you buy into a woman or a man who is true. "Money" is an upbeat pop-savvy cover song of Motown's own Barrett Strong. "Depend On Me" is a true jam. It is a slow jam that is self-explanatory. One thing about the song, listen to the emotion and vulnerability in Smokey's voice; vulnerability is what makes soul jams so worthwhile. He is a great purveyor of emotion, which he handles so delicately with his voice. The group harmony also complements his vocals making for a undisputable classic. To put it all in perspective, Hi We're... is a true doo-wop gem full of style, class, and emotion. This is the start of some great music by the group.

1995, The Delinquents release Outta Control, a short EP a year after 1994's Alleyway, an album long OOP. Luckily, this one is still available. The East Oakland G's drop some serious east bay game over some dope production. The title joint is a str8 G-Funk classic with a nice melody and a bouncy beat. This is the fun-time, sunny, laid back cruising jam that reminds you why G-Funk is the ish. "Gotta Go" is a dope, more serious jam about 1-Time (cops), and also has a nice bouncy lowrider ready g-funk beat. "Independent" proudly describes their place in hip-hop. They drop knowledge about the shiesty industry over another beautiful laidback, sunny g-funk burner beat. The rest of the beats have more of a mob feel and have some harsh gangsta lyrics. There is a hidden track that brings memories of past joints mixed together. Each sample lasts a half-minute. It is sad that these guys were lost among the countless g-funk and gangsta rap west coast artists.

Gang Starr's 4th album Hard To Earn takes a harder, more raw edge. DJ Premier really embarks on his more experimental production. He showed a few signs of it on Daily Operation, but really pushes the envelop here. Guru's rhymes are more harsh here with more profanity. Guru's monotone is perfect for the monotonous but banging funk of "ALONGWAYTOGO." Premier's beat on Tonz'O' Gunz is straight heat, and I love the screeching sound effects on the beat. Guru explains the phenomenon and ramifications of the easy access heads have to guns: Guru's rhymes and Premier's dramatic screeching effects seem to be a "state of emergency adress" based on the vibe the combination gives off. Jeru the Damaja straight rips his verse to shreds the "Speak Ya Clout" track while flexing his skills. Premier's beat changes from another drama siren sounding soundscape to 2 different more relaxed boom bap style beats after Jeru's verse. Premier's flexibility and transition between beats is flawless with scratching indicating the changing beats. "Mass Appeal" was a hit song from the album. I love the looping beat,and the lyrics really hit home today with rappers trying too hard to appeal to the masses with overcommercialized cookie-cutter beats and lyrics. "DWYCK" is a hot boom-bap banger with a cool beat and Nice and Smooth stopping by delivering some humorous lyrics. Nice's verse will make you laugh with his "ooh wee wee's." "Mostly Tha Voice" is where Guru talks about mc's voices (how they sound on the mic), especially his own, and how they are important in addition to skills (of course Guru flexes his skills here and boasts about them). Guru sends a harsh warning to wack emcees on "Suckas Need Bodyguards," and deploys angry battle rhymes here. Overall, Hard To Earn is a highly recommended album with heated lyrics, harsh flows, and great bass heavy boom bap beats. The beats here are the transition between old-school premier and new school Premier on The Moment of Truth.

Willie D rejoins the group after a few years hiatus, and is back with fervor! Willie D, Face, and Bushwick Bill once again have that passionate chemistry and deliver a hard faced album with stone cold rhymes and great beats. As for the production, you get Mike Dean (who does the majority), N.O. Joe, Scarface, Derek Edwards, all great beatsmiths. Stylistically, the album is Southern style G-Funk, like many Houston albums are, but the beats range from a few laidback cuts to some blood curdling horror beats that stomp and shake the ground. The horror joints are the awesome "Still" and "Open Minded" (f/ DMG). The beats are really hard and loud, and the rhymes are lyrical terrorism. "Geto Fantasy" is gumbo style with lyrics about dreams about making it out the hood. "Time Taker" is real chill. The beats is laidback and phat, and the trio deliver some deep knowledge about the meaning of life, how time can just flow away, and judgment day, and making the most of time on earth. Bushwick Bill gets really personal and heart drenching on his solo "I Just Wanna Die." The beat is crazy, gothic, and stomach churning as are Bill's suicidal lyrics. I love the beat on "N---as And Flies" with Derek Edwards delivering the funk. I love the whiny synth in the hook and Willie drops some street and social knowledge. Facemob drops in with GB in "Hold It Down" for a nice mobb joint with an airy but simple beat. All in all, this album is a great reunion of the Houston legends, and the nice beats and crazy spits make this an easy mid 90's classic.

Eric B. and Rakim's third album is one of my favorite albums. I cannot say much more to add to what has been already said, but I am proud to say that I own and love this gem. It is crafted with such finesse, and a flawless chemistry between Eric B and Rakim. Rakim's flow is relentless and ruthless. He has a dominating mic presence, which most people already know. Eric B's beats are straight legal dope. He is one of the original masters of boom bap. His beats are heavy with horns jazz breaks. Some of his beats are mad fast, which gives Rakim the perfect backdrop to spit his sound barrier breaking flow like in songs like "No Omega". B's beats can be slower like "In The Ghetto" and "Step Back," and Rakim's speed adjusts to each beat perfectly. He is a premier battle rapper, and represents the true sense of hip-hop. I always love hearing the dj cuts on their albums, and "Eric B. Made My Day" is no exception. This cut is pure uncut dopeness. There is so much energy and ambition with the beat, and it sounds dope in the ride. The title track is dope, as is its remix. The original has a menacing beat, and the remix is upbeat with dope jazz horns in the hook. Rakim's monotone voice also adds to the serious effect of his rhymes. His voice is dope. Some say monotonous rapper voices may show a lack of charisma, but I disagree here with Rakim, and with others like Guru etc, because it complements the music really well, especially here. All I can really say is that this is PURE hip-hop, and I definitely was hit by the rhythm. Now that overly-commercialized rap plagues the radiowaves, I can always reach for albums like this one, and so can you. Their 1992 Don't Sweat The Technique, or anything else by them for that matter, is essential material.

The Dells release a cool vibin' album here in 1968, but their history goes way back to the early 50's, and their original style was more doo-wop/harmony/early rock n roll(think 1956's Oh What a Nite and another classic "Why Do You Have to Go?"(1957)). There Is still contains the original harmony and Doo-Wop type singing on many tracks, yet their sound is well-updated for the late 60's ballad and uptempo soul/funk style. The title track is a groovy uptempo number with strings and melodies for years. "Stay In My Corner," one of their late 60's classics, a sweet sweeping ballad is an enlongated remake of their own original from circa 1965. Both versions are lovely; this one adds strings and more melodies, and ad libs. "Run For Cover" is another uptempo with a nice funky beat. "Close Your Eyes" is a beautiful love ballad, a perfect slow drag. It sounds like from the early 60's in the doo-wop style. The cd liner notes state that it may be as old as 1962 (which sounds appropriate). I love the "Take a deep breath... woohh.. aah's." "Love Is So Simple" is later doo wop winner possibly from 1967. The ruffled strings in the bridge will send chills down your spine, and the harmony is top notch. "O-O I Love You" is another ballad in the lovely late 60's style with nice guitar licks, yet again with the doo wop harmony. There Is is a surefire soul classic. The Dells stay in tune and in step with the times, yet stay true to their harmony/doo-wop roots. Albums like There Is are the reason why the 60's are some of my favorite years in music even though I wasn't born until the early 80's.

Mad Cj Mac (now just CJ Mac) spits nothing but fire in his debut album "True Game." "True Game" has angry, hard-core rhymes set over an interesting array of G-Funk beats, ranging from laid back as in "Come and Take a Ride," to jazzy as in "Powda Puff," to bass heavy and menacing as in "I Can't Stand a Rat." Of course, it may be gangsta rap, a genre hardly new in 1995, but CJ Mac throws in his own especially angry persona, which makes the album awesome. The use of the whistly, whiny keyboard synths in about half of the songs adds an even more gangsta feel to the cd! Of course, this album is one of many great non-mainstream albums slept on! Despite being from South Central LA CJ had to holla at Lil' J in H-Town to get this record, and aside from the West Coast mentality here, there is a certain third coast influence on many of the beats like the hella sick "Dead Man Walkin'" and the seriously political "Let My N----s Out Tha Pen" and even the classic track "Come And Take A Ride." All in all, the neat mix of Texas and West Coast beats and CJ's firey flows will satisfy any real hip hop head. Another Rap-A-Lot classic!!

5th Ward Houston's own Bushwick Bill comes so hard on Phantom of the Rapra, he'd even give Freddy Kreuger and Jason a run for their money. He holds nothing back throughout the album. He is as gritty as Brotha Lynch Hung, and as stone cold gangster as C-Bo. The beats are a whole other issue. The beats are awesome throughout the album. Generally they draw upon G-Funk; some hint at West Coast; some have the syrupy Texas feel, and some have dark piano and whiny Keyboard riffs that would even scare Dracula. Mad CJ Mac (his name appears as Mad Mac in the liner credits) produces a nice laidback soul inflected G-funk classic with a contemplative Bushwick spitting fire about reality of trying to make enough to make ends meet and surviving in the hood on "Times Is Hard." Swift creates a moody, gothic beat and Bill hammers you with blood curdling terror on "Already Dead." Bill lights up a spliff on "Inhale Exhale, with an awesome melodic mobbin beat. Another classic is "Wha Cha Gonna Do" is a nice hard track showing what he'll do if the world ends, and that he is not afraid of death, and will live life to the fullest without a care. Any serious rap fan should have this. Awesome raps and immaculate beats, what more can you ask for?

Poppa LQ is a lesser known rapper from South Central LA. He rapped alongside CJ Mac (aka Mad CJ Mac in 1995)in CJ's True Game's classic track "Come And Take a ride." Also signed to Rap A Lot, LQ released this album the same year (1995). Like CJ's album, there is an inherent G-Funk feel throughout. However, the beats often tend to be more laid back, and at times, bouncy and party-oriented than in CJ's album. He does have serious subject manner, like tracks such as "Die Like a Gee or Live Like a Trick," or "Killa 4 My Hood" over gangster beats. The album is a fun listen; it offers something for the player, party animal, gangster, or rider in you.

In early 1996, Houston's Ganksta NIP drops his 3rd solo album, Psychotic Genius on Rap-A-Lot/Noo Trybe Records. This album is only one of 2 of his I have (the other is 1998's Interview With A Killa), for his others are hella expensive. I gotta say, what sets him apart from his fello gangsta rap peers is his sheer, bold, terrifying persona. Fans of Brotha Lynch Hung, Spice 1, Bushwick Bill, and X-Raided Locc will probably love this one, but this guy is on another level. He takes the psycho identity to a higher level than the others do. He is a gangsta like the other ones I mentioned, but he more of a psychopathic anti-social than they are. This beats are straight gothic G-Funk mostly produced Swift, with a song or two by each of the following: N.O. Joe, Mezeio Jackson, Mike Banks (Mike B), Gregory Jackson. The beats suit his horrorcore style percfectly. N.O. Joe produces the cool offbeat deep gumbo-funk beat of "Hollograms." The lyrics are as offbeat and menacing. I think it's wierd but cool when NIP uses his gruffy and grumbly alter-ego-voice as he does repeatedly on the album. "Slaughterhouse" is deep-groove dark G-Funk with a screechy whiny synth that would scare Frankenstein, and the lyrics are violently gruesome as the title suggests. "Peep Da Game" is also hard, but more gangsta than gothic, and has a deep-fried southern beat. He also tells us of his 2 personae here. "Hood Talez" has a less boastful beat, but is still hard enough. There is another nice, but less screechy whiny synth, and the lyrics are more gangsta also. "Peace To Da Young G's" again brings in the whiny synth and a nice woozy, G-Funky beat; NIP flexes his mic skills here pretty well. If you are in a depressed mood, then this dark-dungeon vibin' album may either be perfect for you or it may make you even more depressed. This album may also be perfect catharsis for a messed up day. It depends on the listener. I happen to get pumped up by the album. Let's say, Houston, Tx has spawned a wide variety of different styles and acts for the rap scene, mainstream saavy, G-Funk, crunk, gangsta, and horrorcore, and NIP is the prototype of the latter 2 styles. Gangsta rap fans should have no trouble enjoying this one.

5th Ward Boyz are underground legends in Houston and the south. They were not signed to Rap-A-Lot for nathan. They hold it down and keep it gutter throughout. This 1995 album is straight up gangsta rap from E-Rock, 007, and Lo-Life. For the most part, the beats are hella funky, but at the end there are a few crazy, horror beats. Production credits go to Mike Dean, a legend, Scarface, the 5th Ward Boyz themselves, Roger Tausz, Derek Edwards, and Pimp C on one song. My favorite one is either "Swing Wide" or "Concrete Hell." "Swing Wide" features a slammin G-Funk style beat by Pimp C which slaps, and showcases some killa flows from Pimp C and Bun B of UGK along with the 5th Ward Boyz, a hot rider anthem. "Concrete Hell" takes a more serious approach and features cautionary words about the hood over a laidback twangy smokin' beat produced by Mike Dean, 5th Ward Boyz, and Roger Tausz. Another hot one is "5th Ward", where them boyz put it down for their setover a Mike Dean smoker beat. "The Streets" stomps hella hard with a thumpin hard beat and relentless flows by these O.G.s in the game, a perfect gangster anthem. Everything about this album screams H-Town to the fullest. If you like sweet southern fried funk and gangster rhymes, this one is for you.

Rap-A-Lot has been putting out classic after classic in the 1990's, ranging from H-Town's Scarface, Bushwick Bill, Ganxta NIP, Devin The Dude, among countless others, to Cali's Mad CJ Mac and Poppa LQ, and to in the midwest, these guys and A-G-2-A-Ke. Picture This is Do Or Die's first album from 1996. Go Chi Town!!! The production is varied, but hot. The beats range from laid back G-Funk to rattling hardcore with loud whiny keyboard synths. These cats can rhyme fast too. I love the lac thump of the smoking Po Pimp with relentless flows by Do Or Die and Twista perfect for the sunny ride down the ave. "Paperchase" is another laidback rider anthem with a nice guitar riff ridden beat. Then, as for the had core tracks, you get "Kill Or Be Killed;" these guys drop dog eat dog sociology knowledge of the hood over a menacing beat with a Dr Dre influenced whiny synth. "Shut 'Em Down" and "Alpha and Omega" also represent the hardcore side of Do Or Die. "Money Flow" is a slick anthem with a Zapp "Computer Love" sample and an accompanying talk box. These guys are lovers and fighters all the same! This album is underratedand should be in anyone's collection. Support the Rap-A-Lot legacy! These guys helped put it down for Chicago with the help of a legendary label!!

H-Town's own, Tre Deuce, hooks up with legendary producers like Swift, John Bido, Mike Dean and the always awesome N.O. Joe and delivers us with an album full of nathan but fire! The Wicked Buddah Baby is the quintessential rider album. His loc'd up flows and the awesome melodic G-Funk beats get you in the mood to tear the streets up. The album is fun to listen to, not too overly violent or depressing, he can get serious on tracks like "Them Against Me", but he can also be a little humorous and at times laid back on other tracks like "Kickin Flowz." Standout tracks include the relaxing "Buddah Nature (remix)," the bass heavy "Welcome tp the Slab," the sick rider anthem with UGK "Do You Wanna Ride," and "Comin' Down;" heck, just about everythang here slams! Rap-A-Lot is a legendary label and albums like this are testament to it!

Stackin' Chips is an absolute classic from start to finish! These three cats all come together with tight chemistry to spit fire on wax. As for the beats, producers from Tone capone, Ant Banks, Lev Berlak, and even N.O. Joe, and many more work magic in the studio to create some of the phattest G-Funk beats from Cali. "West Coast S---" puts it down for the left coast, over a fun, sunny beat that will make you get the cd, put it in the car and let it shake the trunk as you ride down the avenue! The title track is another classic, with a bouncy, funky beat with faint keyboard whining in the background, perfect to bounce in a lowrider! "Next N----s H-" has a beat that reminds me slightly of the LBC, similar to something Daz Dillinger might produce (although it was produced by Tone capone). All in all, a smokin album by 3X Krazy!! Makes me proud to be raised in California! Don't sleep.

New Orleans born and raised, and Texas bred, Big Mike from the Geto Boys puts it down in 1997 fior his second album, Still Serious. He keeps it playa and smooth here and it works very well. Using many of the same producers from 1994's Somethin' Serious (Mike Dean, N.O. Joe, Mike Banks), and a few new ones like Lorenzo Samuels, Big Mike does it big. The beats are simply fantastic. With that syrupy southern funk, Big Mike kills the mic with awesome flows. "Southern Comfort (On & On)" with Mystical puts it down for N'Awlins over a gumbo pot of funk by Mike Dean. "Still Serious" shows Mike ain't fell off and that he's still here over an airy N.O. Joe beat. Big Mike shows an upbeat side on "It's Alright" with a bouncy G-Funk beat and faster rhymes by Big Mike. Mike gets it playa in "Black Lacquer" and makes it smooth for the hunnies. "Southern Dialect" is where Mike shows how he rose above and got his money on. The beat is twangy Mike Dean funk so you know it'll slap while you roll. "'Burbans & Impalas" is a hot rider song with a Mtume "Juicy" sample. Mike Banks adds his own funk to that song, very melodic and sunny. Whether he is playa, hustler, socialist, Mike's lyrics are good. Productionwise, it is fantastic. Rap-A-Lot doesn't play with booty beats and busta lyrics, and this album testifies to that fact. Pick this up along with "Somethin' Serious" for some trillness and some thump'n funk fo ya trunk.

in 1997, Lex A.D., a very little known rapper from the bay area quietly releases a dope G-Funk album that is hardly ever spoken of. Just like the fellow reviewer G Funkin mentions, Silenced By The Greed is an intelligent and often socially aware album. It does have some great rider and gangsta anthems, and it does have some sunny beats that are cool to listen to. The thing is that the album is heavy on guests, so at times it is like a compilation. It is not a problem, because the guests hold their own as well. My joint here is "Side II Side." The beat is one of the G-Funk beats ever conceived. It has a beautiful sunny feel to it, and it is the perfect anthem to ride and chill to, and it stands as one of my favorite west coast songs of all time. This joint is one of those definitive Cali type 1990's rap songs. On "Side II Side," Lex and Ceese send a positive message to the youth about persevering in life. "Bay Luv" is another cool vibin' G-Funker with another sunny beat with Drizo, Lex A.D., and Cougnut (RIP) all showin luv for their stompin grounds with a cool R&B hook. "Slow Your Roll" is a cool, twangy joint about the reality of life in the hood without glorifying it as many gangsta rap joints do. Ceese and Lex send a message to not run too wild so to not get caught up in a destructive life. "Playa's Blood" is a smooth, bouncy banger perfect for the lowrider. "S--- In The Game" has a more mobbish feel to it. Lex, Drizo, and Ceese buck down a mark MC and schools them on real game. The all spit hard here. "West Coast Thang" puts it down for the left side of the map (especially for Oakland) with a bouncy, Zapp influenced lowrider beat. This joint is also so cool to roll to on a sunny day. Simply put, this album is a diamond in an large expanse of rough. The cd version of Silenced By The Greed now is long out of print and is rare and goes for up to 100 bucks!! But, you can download it here on Amazon. It has that sunny G-Funk vibe, and it has good lyrics to back up the beats. Don't sleep on another classic like this. Download it if you have to.

San Francisco's RBL Posse releases its 3rd album in fall 1997. These guys are known for their dark, mobb sound over hard beats. Anyone reading this who has heard the first 2, esp. Ruthless By Law from 1994 will agree. Ruthless... had a horror-core mobb music overture with loud, piercing whiny synths and violent imagery. This album can be gangsta too, but there is a more laidback, sunnier G-Funk feel to it. Richie Rich stops by on the playa and hustlin' "More Game" over a smooth guitar ridden beat. Another game spitter is the Mtume "Juicy" beat sampled "Straight Lacin'" which is str8 fire. The beat is sunny and has a good rider vibe to it. "You Can't Hang" has a One Way "Cutie Pie" beat pattern, and is a bit darker and more gangsta. "Concrete Jungle" has another laidback funk feel and has a contemplative feel. RBL wonder what could've happened if they did not have rap to go forward. They drop street philosophy over the sweet keyboard ridden beat. RBL get positive on the smooth "Strictly This Game" and look at staying true and trying to stay on top of the rap game without selling out. This joint is so cool to relax to or ride to on a sunny day, kinda like a Warren G joint it's so chill. "How We Comin" features Mystikal and Bigg Lurch. There are 2 mixes, the Southern which has an odd beat, and the West Side mix which is talkbox ridden G-Funk, and they all get their mobb on. "Gone Away" is a reflective joint over another sunny, relaxed keyboard G-Funk beat. They also drop some lines about unity how many do not think about consequences in hood life, and how they don't want to see their homies fall victim to the cycle of gang life. All in all, this album is another classic in their discog. It is chock full of great G-Funk beats, an interesting alternative to their harsh Ruthless By Law, which is also a classic gangsta rap milestone from the bay.

DJ Pooh gets some LA and Long Beach rappers together and spins some cuts and drops some beats for them to rap over in 1997. For the most part, the beats are phat, and many are unlike any I have heard before. I do not like every beat, but some are simply irresistible. The rappers are cool, but Pooh steals the show. His style is deep groove G-Funk with his own individual style. My fav here is "Bump Yo Speakers;" the beat slaps with that LA lowrider funk with Threat's verses gettin you in the mood to sit sideways in a lac I love Charlie Wilson (of Gap Band fame) steppin in to deliver a brief but crazy hook vocal simply stating "bump bump bump bump" with his throaty voice. Kam busts on mark MC's in "Whoop Whoop" with an old school sample; his flows kill. T-Lee busts some flows on the title track where Pooh drops some straight syrupy and twangy sauce. This cat can scratch! Many joints have cuts scratched with absolute precision. My favorite thing, you can see, is the beats on the album. Mista Grimm also takes his turn buckin' down bustas in the whippy funk of "MC's Must Come Down" with some dope background horns. Pooh creates a more laidback atmosphere while Kam drops some more knowledge on "Who Cares" with an Marvin Gaye interpolation in the hook. A scorcher oldschool meets G-Funk era joint is Threat's 4th outta 5 appearances on the bouncy Nowhere 2 Hide. The beat is crazy awesome. I am not too crazy about the beat and lyrics on "No Idea," but Roger Troutman's talkbox and Shirley Murdock's lovely hook vocals are redeeming qualities here! Overall, Pooh and his guests drop a nice G-Funk party jam while droppin some knowledge here and there. Riders, get ya whips juiced, and blast this one on 3 wheel motion!

This is a sweet 1998 single by Syke on Thump Records. There are 3 tracks here. The first one is the single "Hittin' Cornaz" produced by Frankie Peay and Wron G. The joint is a smooth melody driven G-Funk rider anthem with smooth flows by Syke and great R&B vocals by Riley. The second one is a remix done by Scooby Doo with an original sounding G-Funk beat. Honestly, I like the original a lot more, but the remixed beat is pretty cool too. Then, the last track is DJ Rectangle's "Turn Table Terror." The beat is cool lowrider funk with dude spinnin and scratching like a lunatic. Rectangle can scratch like the best of them. This single is a good party starter, and it is also perfect to bring with your 64 to the carshow to floss when hittin' switches.

Tyrone Davis has a neat voice. My favorite track by far is 1979's "In The Mood," what a nice, smooth and uplifting track; as a rap fan, I noticed the sample used by MC Eiht and DJ Slip for the 1994 G-Funk classic: "All For The Money," which turned me on to this song. He has some disco inflected tracks, which I am not a big fan of, but this cat can hold many a slow and mid-tempo jam. "Heart Failure" is a nice slow jam for the hunnies. "Ain't Nothing I Can Do" is another slow to mid tempo soul scorcher with a nice funky beat and nice rhythm. I am mainly a rap feind, but I can appreciate a good soul jam. This collective is a nice intro to Tyrone Davis. Nice to cruise to on a sunny day or when chillin with ya girl!

The Miracles' 2nd full length album, their second in 1961, is yet again another winner. The recipe again is nice doo-wop style harmony and a mix of ballad and more up tempo rock and soul. This 1994 cd re-release has some pretty good remastering considering that the album was 33 years old at the time of re-issue. The album itself is a rockin'good time and represents a great time in Rock `N Roll and Rhythm and Blues music. Smokey Robinson is a master songwriter and crafts some memorable songs here. I was not alive during the doo-wop era but really love that style of music, and Smokey and the Miracles are one of my favorite doo-wop acts. "Mama" is an upbeat rocker where Smokey sings about addressing his mother and telling her that he found a wonderful woman, and though they will struggle financially, they will make it. "Everybody's Gotta Pay Some Dues" is a rich string laden number about what everyone will have to endure in relationships: pain and loss. I love that the 1994 cd issue has a bonus track from circa 1960-61: "Mighty Good Lovin'." "Mighty..." is a wonderful rock n roll/doo-wop jam with a nice guitar riff and uptempo vibe. Songs like this are why I love oldies. "Broken Hearted" is another string-rich number but with a slower, bluesy tempo. Smokey's voice is honey smooth here and displays a tender emotion about a relationship gone wrong. I love the "shoo doo bop bop's" and the heavenly harmony in "The Only One I Love," a sweet ballad with a slower tempo and guitar ridden beat. "Embraceable You" is a classy jazz standard/cover and is sweet and slow for your honey love. Cookin With The Miracles is definitely a highlight in Motown's catalogue. CD copies are hard to come across and are really expensive, but for soul collectors like me, are more than worth it. For what it's worth, for the budget minded, most of the songs, save for a couple tracks can be downloaded off of The Complete Motown singles 1959-1961, here on Amazon. But, I feel that the album is best experienced as a whole. If you do purchase it get ready for a delicious meal cooked by Chef Smokey and his Miracle cooking staff.

I was not even close to being born when the latest dating joint on this collection was made. This collective for the most part is their 1960's classics, with one from 1959 and 2 from the early 70's, a decade before I was even born (1982 FYI). This music is Rhythm And Blues in its purest form. I can relate to this music more than the RnB of today. "Bad Girl" from 1959 is such a beautiful doo-wop style harmony, and Smokey Robinson's voice has such a passion in it. The simplistic beat is just so relaxing and cool to chill or ride to. "Tracks Of My tears" (1965) is such a beautiful love lost ballad. I love the harmonization in the hook, especially the "do-do-do's" with the deep voices. There are some tight party type joints like the fast-paced "Going To A Go-Go," (1965) which was the way to "get it crunk" back in the '60's. "I Like It Like That" (1964) is a slower, yet cool party joint. This one I envision playing in an old-school impala sittin on 3-wheel motion. The tempo is so cool as is the swagger of Smokey and his Miracles. "Ooh Baby Baby" (1965) is marvelous too. He and the Miracles really push their vocals. The song is about a lost love due to mistakes made in the relationship, and the hopes of getting that love back. There are 25 jams from 1959-1972, and it definitley got me geekin' for more of their works, for this is essentially my intro to their genius works. Also, for the listener getting more interested in Smokey Robinson, or for those who know his music and want a good greatest hits comp should check his solo The Ultimate Collection, from the same Motown collections as this one is. This group has left a good legacy for RnB and Soul and Oldies. Great listening for that sunny summer ride or trip, or whenever you want to reminisce when RnB was unmatchable.

What a loss when Fat Pat got killed in early 1998! This young cat from Houston, Texas had a charted album, his 1998 debut, Ghetto Dreams; he did not even live to see that dream come true. Now, if you have had the same bad luck getting his debut like I have had so far, this may be a great, temporary substitute. This is his greatest hits collection. Good news, this joint has most of the songs from Ghetto Dreams, save for 5 or so joints. There are many joints from Dead End Alliance's 1998 joint album, Screwed 4 Life, which Pat was a member of. Now, Fat Pat is a flossy rapper like many mainstream rappers, but he has a dope, engaging personality and is fun to listen to, and Wreckshop Records inhouse producers, esp. D-Wreck, lace Pat with some phat, funky beats; many bear a distinctive G-Funk influence with a southern twist. A real classic, "Reality" from Ghetto Dreams has a straight up west coast beat, and a woozy synth line similar to 1994's "Who Got The Gangsta S---" by Tha Dogg Pound, Swoop G, and Snoop from Murder Was The Case soundtrack, and a phat lowrider beat. Pat spits some knowledge and even sings the hook!!! Another classic, and I MEAN CLASSIC, is "Friends We Know" which touches on homies turnin' against you, and trusting others, is sick. The beat is absolutely awesome!!! The beat is laidback with multi-layered melodies giving off a sunny vibe, another classic from Ghetto Dreams! I'm not yet sure where "Jammin' Screw" is from, but the joint is relaxing and fun with a dope guitar-ridden beat, and a smooth bass line. I am relatively new to Fat Pat right now, but am definitely hooked!! A few Dead End joints here are the classics "Full Time Playa," a relaxed G-Funk joint, the serious contemplative joint "Better Place," and "Screwed For Life" among others. A nice sweet love joint is "If U Only Knew," a softer, and laidback joint 4 the hunnies with a beautiful, melodic beat from His Fat Pat and The Wreckshop Family album: Throwed In The Game, an album with a few songs featured here too. You get "Tops Drop," a phat lowrider joint from Ghetto Dreams. Simply put, get this joint; it is 2 discs of material from a great fallen soldier who coulda recognized his Ghetto Dreams if he hadn't been killed. R.I.P. Fat Pat. Hope u sittin' sideways in a Six-Fo in heaven loc.

The bay is well-known for independent hustle and their numerous compilation discs, and this 1997 compilation definitely brings some heat to the table. It definitely draws upon the mobb music sounds and themes that were popular in the 90's. I gotta say, the beats rock. The atmosphere is a mix of mobb funk and a heavy dose of G-Funk. Lyrically, there is nothing revolutionary here, but the rappers definitely make it a fun listen. B-Legit and Kaveo kick some serious flows over the smokin' gangsta joint "Gladiator Tank." The beat by K-Lou is zapp influenced G-Funk with a neat whiny synth reminiscent of Dr. Dre's keyboard whines. "Throw Your Hands Up High" with Rodney O and Suga T is simply an awesome gangsta party lowrider joint. Celly Cel as usual kicks some harsh flows with Levitti delivering his vintage hooks over a neat beat perfect to b-walk or c-walk to (Levitti does the beat, and it reminds me of a Battlecat beat). "Raise Up Off These N--s" is interesting. Some rather unknown artists Akil Truso and Ashley Moten kick some serious flows over a neat guitar ridden beat. A verse by 2Pac (RIP)from his underground joint "Static" opens up the joint. "Tha Fatha Figga" is a real laidback G-Funk scorcher with JT The Bigga Figga and Snoop Dogg trading verses. JT kicks some hustla flows, and Snoop kicks his slick laconic flow and both's flows complement the beat. Other guests include E-40, The Mossie, Dru Down, N2 Deep, Baby Beesh, and some other major underground bay figures. If you want some good slumpers to roll sideways to, some joints to chill to, or get ya boogie on, this banger will get it crunk.

RBL Posse's first album is loaded with heat that'll get your stereos thumpin all day. The lyrics are menacing, straight up old fashioned gangsta rap, totally unlike the candy MTV rap of today. All of the beats beats courtesy of Black C (G's By The 123's by TC) are neat. I love the old school P-Funk samples, so you know the beats are bouncy, perfect for lowridin down the avenue. In fact, some of the beats and samples slightly hint at old school Ice Cube, but with a bay area twist. G-Funk gems like this were sadly slept on, and are still so today.

1994, Spanish Fly puts it down for Harbor Area in L.A. with some latin-tinged low-rider ready hip-hop. Spanish Fly and Brian Dobbs (I believe maybe Brian "Wino" Dobbs of Coolio fame but not sure) lace up old-school influenced hip-hop rich with some soul and doo-wop samples from the 60's, and mix in some Latin flava to spice it up. Many of the samples are easily recognizable. My favorite jam here is "Kill 4 Thrillz," a hard core g-funk jam which features their homie Lil' Chill from Compton. The beat has many layers of samples along with a twangy background beat and faint whiny synth. "Murder Goin' On In The Area" has the same twangy g-funk vibe and has a menacing vibe. "The Wrong Side of the Tracks" employs a sped-up sample of the Miracles "Tracks of My Tears." It deals with a guy from one hood getting involved with a girl from another hood, and the dangers and ramifications of crossing gang lines. Another Miracles sample "You Really Got a Hold On Me" comes in the "Dope's Gotta Hold On Me" and channels the doo-wop vibe in the beat. They personify the dope as a woman. "Tequila" features some Latin lowrider vibes that sound cool in the ride perfect for flossin' down the ave in L.A. "Smile Now I Won't Cry Later" samples Ben E. King's "Stand By Me" only with a faster, bouncier beat. Spanish Fly is def savvy with their soul music and it reflects in the samples used. Trust No Man is an album full of straight forward gangsta rap and fun lowrider ready jams. This album, sadly, was lost among the insurmountable wave of popular west coast gangsta rap and g-funk albums of 1994-1995.

Jayo felony's debut album, Take a Ride slams and satisfies from start to finish. He is raw and rugged throughout. The beats here are hard core G-Funk, with vicious and rapid fiery flows. Songs like "I'mma Keep Bangin," "They Got Me On Medication," "The Loc is On His Own," show cases his hard, but unique persona. He put San Diego on the map, and shows no mercy!

Compton's Forty Thevz dropped a quiet but classic debut in the shadow of their homie Coolio in 1997 on Mercury records called Honor Amongst Thevz. Come early 2000, they finally come out with another album on their own label (40 Thevz Records), Lef 4 Dead. The album is hella short, only 10 songs, so there is little room for error. This album is not flawless, but there are a few definite bangers that are potential classics here. A couple tracks have weird beats like "Slang 'Em On A N---a," and a song with a weird hook, "Say Ah Prayer 4 Me" with Rated R with decent lyrics and a nice beat, but who I believe to be Spidaman delivering an odd vocal. My favorite joints are the classic cuts "Appreciate" and "For The Homies Locked Up." The former is awesome with a laidback, keyboard driven G-Funk beat dropping some love for those who have helped them come up. The lyrics and the beat play great together, and the beat's great for a laidback ride. The latter is also laidback G-Funk, and drops some knowledge. The beat is perfection!! These 2 beat anything else I have heard from the year 2000. "Hay Hay Hay Hay" is bouncier funk. The beat is phat, and great for a house party. "Come Up Outta That" gets it crunk for the hunnys with a smooth, melodic, Cali style beat. Overall, this album is good, with a couple weaker tracks, offset with some classics, and a few fun ones, a dope post-G-Funk era album.
