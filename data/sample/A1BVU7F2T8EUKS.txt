Maybe cause I heard this album way back in the day and for Christian music it was lightyears ahead of most anything else - I still think it gets 5 stars. The first half is fine but my favorite is the second half.Now newly remastered and with extra material.So "worldly" sounding and so good and still spiritual impact.I love it.(As far as Hendrix comment on Keaggy - see snopes.com)

Great album with the best at the end. Phil Keaggy (who claims Jimi Hendrix never said that Keaggy was the best in the world-but it IS a believable statement once you have heard him play), Dan Pecchio and John Sferra play some music of their time but it is done so well it still stands up today.Hints of Yes, ELP, and other bands - but fresher and more satisfying to my ears.

The Penguin guide, which seems to like the Lindsays (as do I) says this set ranks alongside the finest. Less mistakes than the Lindsays make. Slower in some parts than other first rate quartets. Depth of feeling as good or better than any other version. Great sound.Also good are The Italian Quartet and the Talich - but they both are older recordings that aren't quite as good as the two quartets mentioned above. But some still claim them to be the best.

I can't add more than just another 5 star review. The vocals don't seem so unique or possibly grating on this cd as on their earlier discs. Not that the singer's voice is bad - it just took a little getting used to on, for example, Picaresque.The songs are better than ever before, and the tasty prog rock touches were lovely! I was thoroughly impressed and salivating while listening to this disc. Picaresque and Castaways may be just as good - but this was quicker for me to take a liking to.

First, CR likes this TV line naming one of their larger models a best buy. So, yes quality is very good for the price.There is no discussion here about size. I have read (in CR) that many/most people who buy tvs smaller than 40 inches wish they had bought bigger models. In my small apartment 40 inches is too big, but a 32 inch would be ideal, and this 27 inch tv would be fine, I think.From another site:"Is this the right size HDTV for your room? Standard calculations suggest that the viewing distance between set and seat should be roughly 3x to 5x the screen width. By this measure, any 32" set would be ideally viewed from around eight to ten feet away"But, by my calculations up to thirteen feet way would be okay for 32 inch sets. And, 27" sets ideally are viewed from about seven to eleven feet away.Any discussion of this point?

Interesting for a beginner. Part of the "In Classical Mood" Series which also includes other titles like "Air of Spring."CD contains some pieces related to a theme. The music is performed by people like Swiss Chamber Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Trevor Pinnock and "the English Concert", Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Vienna Symphony Orchestra. They may be older recordings - no way to know.Small hard cover book explains a little about each composer - like one paragraph on the composer, one paragraph about the topic of one of the pieces, one paragraph about maybe the city the composer was from, one paragraph about another famous piece by the composer, and one definition of a classical music term. All parts relate to the one piece, and there are four or five parts for each of 12 musical selections. With pictures.Great for an introduction. A nice gift for a young classical music enthusiast, or an older neophyte with mild attention deficit like me! The substance of the text is lacking and the music is not the newest recording, but it is designed to wet your appetite without throwing too much "learning" at you, I think.

Good gregorian chant singing songs by Simon and Garfunkel, Eric Clapton, Metallica !!, others. They have more than one disc.I thought they pulled off this stylistic "mashup" very well. I don't know how seriously you can take the words - it isn't a worship aid. But it is interesting and well done.I played Nothing Else Matters to my prayer group and some of the younger participants almost fell off their chairs laughing, while others (older people) thought it was nice.

My first cd was "Mary Jean and 9 Others" - great hook laden pop. Maybe too hooky - like eating candy.Then I went to his classic first album - I liked it.Now a two cd greatest! Yay!His other collection is the one cd "This is Easy" which is also good, but this one sounds better I think.

A collection of the best of their two albums before Avalon, with two all time classics (Love is the Drug and Do the Strand)thrown in to make a great collection.This (on LP) was my first introduction to Roxy Music. If you want instant pop classics - start here.There are no songs from Avalon - probably their best cd - because Avalon came next. And their whole catalog is well worth hearing. The earlier you go the more adventurous they were. Nothing from Country Life on this collection and only one song from Siren. So it is not a greatest hits cd - for sure.There are a few later collections that have more songs. But these 10 songs never let you down. One of the good places to start!

Oh my! I have been waiting for this cd. There was a rumor and in fact a listing for "The Tooth of the Crime" a few years back - that was supposed to be his greatest hits - or was it a soundtrack to a play he was working on? But it never was released. Too busy producing other great artists. Now it is here.I like all of T-Bone's cds - except for Talking Animals. I have heard each of these songs in their original forms on the previous cds and vinyl. This is a great collection. The re-recordings of the Proof songs are going to be a let down if you are used to the originals, though. Be forewarned. I think they are well done - we are all just so attached to the original versions. If the original is ever released on cd, this won't be a problem at all.My one peeve - Trap Door was not available on cd up until now - here half of the songs are available. We need the other songs!Trap Door (EP) Track Listing----------Hold on Tight - not on Twenty TwentyDiamonds are a Girl's Best Friend - yesI Wish You Could Have Seen Her Dance -yesA Ridiculous Man - not on Twenty TwentyPoetry - not on Twenty TwentyTrap Door - yesSame goes for Proof Through the Night - there are still GREAT songs not on cd!(edited on May 19th, and June 1 2006)

ICE magazine recently contacted some people who worked with McCartney on this compilation. The record company asked Paul to drop &quot;Give Ireland Back To The Irish&quot; because of some bombings that happened immediately before the release. So, they dropped it even though prerelease info said the song would be included.Also, a lot of the songs were edited versions - in hopes of getting more songs on the discs. Dropping &quot;Give Ireland&quot; at the last moment left about five minutes that could have been used - but time was short and the TV special of the same name was about to start.Not that that explains every song included or omitted here, but then taste is somewhat relative.Thank you all for your reviews on this and other albums. They are very helpful to me.

Dr. Weil has about as good a summary as any you will find on this partially researched substance. Google Dr. Weil dot com and then d-riboseSafe, some research that supports it, and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that should not be dismissed.These are handy orange flavored tablets 1.5 grams each. Usual recommended dose is 10-15 grams/day in 2-3 doses. But maybe less if less works for you.They taste ok - not great and not bad. Do they work? Depends on your body, apparently. I just started taking them for energy. So, it may take a few days to a month to work, from what I have read.

GOOD------phone seems fine,battery life is good,sound is good.Radio included comes in handy sometimes.KEYBOARD MAKES EMAIL EASY - how would you do it without bluetooth to another device or taking soooo long to type in the letters? This keyboard is easier to use than the Treo models design - though, they aren't too bad.POOR----Kind of slow. Nokia is soon to release the new 6800 series (6810 and 6820 I think) which will use edge technology - much faster.Screen is pretty low quality. Hard to read much beyond a sentence at a time. Not a problem, but could be much better.Overall - a phone you can actually use to email. Very handy. With more resolution in the screen and speed in the service it would actually be a viable way to surf the net. As is it is adequate for on the road.

The cd started out fine but got noisy and by the time I got to "Hopeless" I was thinking - "this better improve or I will sell my copy." I listened to it four times, no improvement.Metacritic site rates it as one of the best of the year, but it was too noisy and tuneless for me. Guess I am mellowing in my old age.No doubt it is a great album, but I did not like it. My copy is sold to someone with better music appreciation skills.

I like piano trios. Some of the Beaux Arts Trio recordings seem a little boring, even though they are one of the most popular and positively reviewed trios. I do like the Florestan Trio recordings.Well, I had never heard of the Arden Trio - but I like this cd very much. Good material and excellent playing."The Arden Trio's 1987 debut recording of Saint-Saens and Ravel Trios on Delos prompted The Strad magazine to comment, 'If there is a recording of a trio that sounds better than this, I haven't heard it.'"

David Russel and Jason Vieux may be better, but to my ears Sharon Isbin is the most appealing classical guitar player in the world. Segovia is the master and the breakthrough artist, but those that came after are better. Ms. Isbin is my favorite so far.(By the way, this set contains 6 of the 23 tracks on the Bach Lute suites - so you might do well to pick up that wonderful cd as well. I did.)

I had a wrong view about the school bus series - I just didn't like the school bus always being in the books and shows and then Ms. Frizzle wasn't my favorite character. So, I never really watched or read one of these movies/books.We got this book at a yard sale and my 4.5 year old loves it. I like it too - I learned things I didn't know. Just don't expect to like Ms. Frizzle - she is a tool. Of the author!

The Album: Not their best but still goodCD players: - Rex made all the right points - if all you have is a cd player - you might want to skip this rerelease. There is no upgraded sound version for you.DVD players: You can get surround sound from your dvd player, but it won't be as high quality as a DVD-A player (of course some people say there isn't much difference - that it is all in the remastering of the disc and not so much in the better technology of the player.DVD-Audio players: are not that expensive as of now (2006) but may soon go the way of the quadrophonic record player! If you have a DVD-A player this is worth getting, in my opinion (again as Rex spelled out).MP3 players: I have not yet seen a computer drive that will record in surround sound or in DVD-A quality sound - so on the Ipod it won't do anything more for you than the cd you have had for years now, as Rex said. Maybe they will come out with new drives - or maybe they are already out - I haven't heard or seen them.

I was intrigued with the 2nd album and songs like &quot;On The Air&quot; and &quot;DIY&quot; and the fact that Robert Fripp was involved. But, this album does not really hold up well enough IN MY OPINION to have anything on a greatest hits album. Maybe &quot;DIY&quot; should have been included just as a representative.And, in my opinion, &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Big Time&quot; could have been left off, and &quot;I have the touch&quot; and one or two other songs added! All just personal preferences that do not represent others opinions.All in all it is hard to fault the selection based on my preferences. Gabriel is so worth listening to, and that is why we are peeved at the song selection.Why not a disc three - with all the missing favorites? Maybe a fan club can take a poll and suggest a selection for a third disc.

I keep reading reviews that say this album will take many listens to unfold - and then you will appreciate it. Not in my experience. I listened to it once so far and I love it!It sounds like a cross between album #3 (&quot;melt&quot; or &quot;melted face&quot;) and the album &quot;Us&quot; with some new sounds added in.So, if you liked album #3 and want something even more up to date - get &quot;Up.&quot; If you like Peter Gabriel because of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and &quot;Big Time&quot; then you might have to let this one unfold for a while. Or you might want to listen before you buy.By the way, the Barry Williams Show sounds good also. I don't know why people knock that song.

Owned for three weeks and decided there wasn't enough bass (no seal problems here). Even classical sounded lacking without decent bass.Also lacked ambience - transients - the sound of notes decaying and richocheting around your ear drums. I got used to this, though, and didn't mind it.The bass I minded - even if just for classical, but there is also rock where bass is even more important!Decision made.

This is a wonderful movie - with much more artistic content than the earlier shorter Christmas story video. It is great except that for half the movie people are calling Charlie Brown names. Blockhead, worthless, etc etc. We had to stop the movie while our four year old was half through. I should have prescreened it.I don't trust peanuts videos now - for my impressionable four year old. Maybe when she is older...(P.S. - read the thoughtful comments to my review. I guess the problem is not necessarily with the movie but with my daughter's age)

While this is not true research - no double blind, or placebo controls - this is pretty impressive anecdotal evidence. 500 psychologists and therapists recommend what self-help books really do help, and which are mediocre or downright dangerous. My only complaint is that it is now 9 years old - many new books have been written based on good research (see John Gottman - "Why Marriages Succeed or Fail" and Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross - "Changing for Good")Where is the second edition?Edit - "Authoritative Guide to Self-Help Resources in Mental Health" by Norcross and Santrock is the updated version. 2000

Volumes 2 and 3 are excellent (though not sacds). I assume this (Volume 7) is about as good.The cds in the series are "recorded at DCS 24-bit A to D convertors at a sampling rate of 176.4Khz." This is not a 16-bit 44.1 Khz recording!SACDs have "a high sampling rate system with 1 bit resolution of 2.8 Mbps" but sound equivalent to DVD-Audio discs which have 24 bit / up to 196Khz specs. (from what I gather on the web).The recording done for this cd seems like a very pretty good recording quality if microphoned correctly. So what if it is not DSD - it is pretty close, and may be equal or better, right?If someone out there knows more, please correct this discussion. Thanks.

Some of the critics recomend geting the live but well done Oil On Canvas. I like this one much better. It is fuller. I would have added Cantonese Boy (Tin Drum), Sons Of Pioneers (Tin Drum), Swing (Gentlemen Take Polaroids) and Taking Islands In Africa (Gentlemen...). I won't bother you with what songs I would have taken off.But this is still a good selection. The night I brought home the vinyl - back in 1987? - I was astonished at how artful and beautiful it was. I like Sylvian's Gone To Earth and Secrets of The Beehive better - but this album is up there with them.So, I bought this one and then got Gentlemen and Tin Drum. I haven't heard Quiet Life - so maybe that one is worth getting as well. (Which might make this one unnecessary.) But, start here. Not with Oil on Canvas.

I too was swept into being a Waterboys fan with This is the Sea and Fisherman's Blues. I would rate this right up there with those albums. Maybe not as consistently great musically as FBlues (there are two songs that go on too long in order to tell a story - City Full of Ghosts and Edinburgh Castle) but the songs that click amaze me.Try Bring 'em All In" and "Building the City of Light." Wow. A very personal and spiritual album. Every time I see a copy in the dollar bin I buy it to give to someone!

I don't know much about classical music or string quartets, but I have read a lot of reviews. The Quatuor Mosaiques get consistently great reviews. This is their first Beethoven SQ cd and I love it. It seems the bass (cello and Viola) is louder than usual in SQs and I really like this balance.The Takacs are also VERY good and have a complete cycle, now. But I had to buy this one as well.

Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though.

This was a special acoustic release - probably under pressure from the new record company (Home Sweet Home/Chris Christian).But what a great album. Sounds like James Taylor doing better material than James usually does.If you want rock - go for the good Dominoes or the great Victims of The Age album. If you want modern sophisticated pop rock get Ashes and Light or Mosaics. If you want folk rock get one of the last three albums. If you want pop ballad acoustic style this is the album - until Appalaichan Melody gets released.

I am not much of an Al Green fan and don't know "black gospel" or "R&B;" that well. I just happened to have the Higher Plane record years ago and thought it was mesmerizing !A couple songs that I didn't particularly go for, but the rest showed me why Al is so highly regarded. "His Name is Jesus" is one of my all time faves !Just my two cents. I don't know the "Lord Will Make a Way" tracks at all.

Sure Caillou sounds like a four year old once in a while - that is, a bit "whiney." That is why my daughter loves him and why she always prefers to watch Caillou to other cartoons - he is fairly realistic with frustrations and occasional tantrums (though only two I have seen in the whole series).That is a big part of why my daughter loves to watch Caillou - he has the same issues and joys that she does and she learns how to deal WELL with reality from this show.That is why I like Caillou - though I have seen them all about 15 times now and hope she outgrows Caillou soon. But, this is much better than Barney and Blue's Clues, better than the Wiggles, and about as good as Angelina Ballerina. (The lineup on our movie shelf).I avoided Caillou for a while cause of the "whiney / tantrum" reputation. I think it is unfounded.We have all but one dvd of the series. "Caillou's Holidays" is particularly good and it and the more recent releases have no puppets - which is the one part my daughter is not wild about.

I am not a seasoned classical music fan. I only got into it about a year ago. So, I don't know much about how this piece should be played, period versus modern instruments, etc.I do like Kurt Cobain and think he should not be dismissed so lightly, by the way. He has HUGE respect from all the music critics I read.But anyway, I like period instruments for some unknown reason more than modern ones. I like Gardiner's renditions of this and the other Beethoven symphonies. As one reviewer said about the 3rd and 5th disc:"Gardiner's band clubs you on the head. His Beethoven is an all-out assault on one's musical sensibilities. For me it works."So, the comparisons to Hendrix and Cobain may be apt to some degree - but, certainly not to the degree the liner notes would have you believe. (Sid Vicious? I don't think he wrote or played much of anything well. That is a really poor comparison.)

Dancing in the Shadows was wrecked on the previous compilation. This two disc set is the real deal (a couple songs on the first album were shortened to fit everything on two discs).The first album is not as good as the other two - they got better as time went on. The last album is great! (The outtake "bonus tracks" are welcome but most are not that good.)If all you've heard is the American releases you are missing more than half of the great songs they put out!

For Christian music fans the crossing over of Kerry Livgren from the mainstream Kansas to Christian Rock Artist (if that tag is fair) was a great cause to rejoice.There were songs about God on many old Kansas albums, then came Seeds of Change (in it's entirety on the first cd here). Wonderful, with guest artists like Ronnie James Dio, Mylon LeFevre and David Pack.Kansas put out two more albums with Kerry in full evangelism mode - Vinyl Confessions (GREAT) and Drastic Measures (pretty good).Then Livgren left Kansas and formed AD and released Timeline - also in it's entirety on this collection. Again, great stuff.There are a few previously unreleased cuts on this set and some cuts from later albums - Art of the State, Reconstructions, Prime Mover and One of Several Possible Musiks.If you like Kansas then you will probably like this if you don't mind the Christian messages.

Some may give this two cd set five stars, but the overtures and a few of the other songs stray too far from my particular taste in music. But, some of the quiet songs are very good musically, to the ears of the rock n roll lover. And others are very impressive because of Card's ability to get across heart felt theological thought in a winning alignment of words. One of the few albums I could listen to solely for the words.I also recommend "Present Reality" which is from about the same era - stunning mix of quiet music and meaningful words. I haven't listened to any of his more recent cds, but a greatest hits package will be fine as well.

If you read reviews of other editions of the Movie Theater Storybook and Movie Projector series (Disney Princess Movie Theater) you will see reviews like,"This is a frustrating toy ... it does not work terribly well." and "...the projector is SO mini that it needs to be very close to the wall or screen in order to be seen (2-3 inches) and the image is very small."and"The projector image is so tiny and blurry, its sometimes impossible to recognize the characters."It was really helpful to read these negative reviews, because when it came with all it's faults my expectations were so low that I was happy with it.In my daughters book, the reading light didn't work at all. I had to sand down this white tube that holds the contact metal piece for the light to make contact and work. Also the reading light is aimed sideways and up (??!!) not down at the page. Who designed that??But the images can get as big as 8-10 inches in a dark room, the focus can be adjusted (and readjusted and readjusted if the screws holding the thing together are not tight) to make them reasonably clear. And I think the book can be read, with some difficulty, while showing the slides - even with my failing eyesight (1.5 glasses).So, in the end I think when my daughter gets this for her birthday I will then be able to say what another reviewer said about the Disney Princess Movie Theater:"I still give it a high mark because of the many hours my kid has spent playing with it. She is rough on the projector and the disks and they have taken it well so far."

First of all, ad hominem arguments have a place when people are being asked to follow and fund and vote for someone. So, I think there is a place for this information.But the more I search the internet the more I find that the author made up the facts - to some extent at least.Al Franken wrote this letter to the National REview:I do not rail against audiences for not employing more minorities. What Schweizer was referring to is a joke I tell when I give speeches at a lot of corporate events. The joke is: "First of all I want to congratulate (name of company) for not giving into that whole affirmative action nonsense."There was a "non-white" student who helped research Lies and the Lying Liars. I was never executive producer of SNL, but when I served as producer for the 1985-6 season, we hired Danitra Vance, who was both a writer and a cast member and was African American. (Danitra has since passed, although National Review did not give it the attention it gave to Belushi's death, because, I assume, she was black.)One of my researcher/producers on my Air America show is black. When we first started, the second researcher I hired was black. He left to finish Yale Law School. Our archivist is black.In his book Schweizer makes up some statistic that I've hired something like a 107 people during my career and only one has been black. First of all, it appears that Schweizer came up with his number by rather creatively manipulating the definition of who I've hired. For example, he counts the writers of my projects. Well, I am a writer, often the sole writer, on all my projects. So he counts me several times. And, yes, I admit it. I am always white.Also, he includes the producers of my projects, almost all of which I produce. Since the projects I produce are those for which I am a writer, he counts me twice for each of those. And again, when I produce, I am always white.For some reason, Schweizer doesn't include Sanaa Lathan, a cast member of my sit com Lateline, nor Lenny Garner who directed an episode of that show. Sanaa is now a movie star, but not because of Lateline. Schweizer doesn't include any of the skilled crew of that show or any of the other projects that I've been involved in.I thank you for the opportunity to correct the record, particularly since Doubleday refuses to do so for the paperback version of Schweizer's book.Your pal,Al FrankenMinneapolis, MinnesotaThe facts on Pelosi may not be totally fair and accurate, either. More as I find more...

In my opinion - Larry has had many good cds worth buying. But there are three GREAT ones:Only Visiting This Planet is possibly the best. Rock and Pop and ballads. Amazing!Second up for pop fans - In Another Land. More pop oriented and the production sounds a bit home made at times, but still excellent.Second place for blues and hard rock fans - Something New Under the Son. Blues and hard edged (psychadelic at times) blues. Another killer album (if you'll pardon the expression). The song "Watch What You're Doing" impressed Frank Black of the Pixies so much that he named their first album "C'mon Pilgrim" after part of the lyrics of that song. IT IS THAT GOOD!Other cds worth buying (check out Larry's site at guess where) are Upon This Rock, So Long Ago The Garden, Home At Last, Stranded in Babylon and Tourniquet. I own all these except So Long Ago - I liked the original version better. The one available now is Larry's preference. There may be others that are good or great but I haven't heard them.

This was the first Nick Drake album I really liked and I attributed it to the improved sound. I always thought he was good but I got a bit bored with him over a whole album of songs.Subsequently with a new better stereo I am in love with all of his stuff (at least the three studio albums, so far).I think the sound is pretty good for early seventies / late sixties recordings.I liked this better than "Way To Blue: An Introduction" though now that that has been remastered maybe this disc is only to test out your surround sound.

I really liked the first version of this book and this latest revised version has even more information.Rosenthal writes in a way that keeps your interest high and gives you a summary of the latest research. Wise advice on a shiny silver platter (to mangle a proverb).Dr. Rosenthal seems to be a good guy. His wisdom, humor and compassion are reflected in his books. I doubt you will be dissapointed!By the way, I didn't come to this page to review the book - I came to buy it after reading someone else's copy. (Here comes winter!)

Ok for walking around, but not while you are driving:Is having a cell phone pressed to your ear while behind the wheel the equivalent of driving while intoxicated? According to a study by University of Utah psychologists, the answer is, unfortunately, yes."Just like you put yourself and other people at risk when you drive drunk, you put yourself and others at risk when you use a cell phone and drive," writes David Strayer, a psychology professor and the study's lead author. "The level of impairment is very similar."The study, published in the June 29 issue of Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, found that drivers talking on cell phones, either handheld or hands-free, are more likely to crash because they are distracted by conversation.Using a driving simulator under four different conditions: with no distractions, using a handheld cell phone, talking on a hands-free cell phone, and while intoxicated to the 0.08 percent blood-alcohol level, 40 participants followed a simulated pace car that braked intermittently.Researchers found that the drivers on cell phones drove more slowly, braked more slowly and were more likely to crash. In fact, the three participants who collided into the pace car were chatting away. None of the drunken drivers crashed."This study does not mean people should start driving drunk," said co-author Frank Drews. "It means that driving while talking on a cell phone is as bad as or maybe worse than driving drunk, which is completely unacceptable and cannot be tolerated by society."

I just heard this today in the store. I thought this cd wasn't coming out for another two weeks. So, while looking for Tchaikovsky cds in the store I heard some of this and it sounded wild but very appealing. I thought - I should find out who this is and buy it. Then the sounds got a little more familiar - of course - it is the Lips!It doesn't sound that different from the last two - just different enough to be really appealing. I have already just about memorized Yoshimi and the Soft Bulletin.I didn't really like the cds that came out before the Soft Bulletin. I like this one. I found it easily accesible while still pushing the boundaries of their sound in a very tasty way.

I know very little of classical music. About the only stuff I like is Baroque style. Mozart and Beethoven bore me. (Sorry). So don't look here for an in-depth review.I heard this cd on the radio and it was riveting. A nice mix of oboe, violins, harpsichord, etc. It is going to join my Four Seasons cd and my couple of Bach cds. Wish I could find more classical that I liked.

Interesting - The book kept me up late into the night reading it.Funny - some things, when he wasn't being rude, were very funny.Good Info - aside from the almost total lack of critique of democrats, the info seems sound to my partially informed mind. Micheal Moore has a more balanced view in this regard, but doesn't write as well.Harsh - telling the truth is one thing. Truths in this book alone will bring on a lot of attacks. But he adds some name calling, though not too many ad-hominym (spelling?) attacks.It is the sarcasm that will limit the effectiveness of this book. If I gave it to my Republican leaning friends they would probably throw it out after a few pages (just as I would any book by Hannity or Limbaugh). Franken is unnecessarily rude, in my opinion.But, if you can get past that, and his (hypocritical) cry for a nicer tone in politics, this book has a lot of good information. I like the book. I like the guy. He just needs to find ways to be funny without being caustic.As his son said in the chapter on Bob Jones University, &quot;Dad leave them alone. What have they ever done to you?&quot;(Hmmm - well, maybe the Republicans have done horrible things (See Michael Moore's movie Bowling for Columbine), but so have the Democrats (ditto) and why return evil for evil? Why not try to be fair and balanced in tone as well as information?)

I have heard this is highly recommended by a njumber of sources. Classics Today gave it a 9/9, but Classics Today gave the Reiner version a 10/10 for sound - even though some folks say there is audible tape hiss!?!This one is 5.1 channel surround sound, while Reiner's is 3 channel. Probably can't go wrong with either version. This one has the piano version of the Pictures as well, and two versions of Night.... The Reiner version has a variety of pieces by other composers in addition to Pictures and Night.I hear Karajan's and Szell's versions are also top notch - but haven't heard them.

Great playing and great sound? At least when I read the reviews (look at almost any book of reviews) I see that the critics agree.Have the Mosaiques ever released a bad album?

As mentioned in other reviews, this is the stuff that has been tested in clinical trials. Other brands may or may not work, the FDA still does not (is not able to) test the quality of supplements. Though the LA Times did a few years back and this was found to be good. Search for "Testing St. John's Wort LA Times" and for more up to date info, "Evidence supports St. John's wort" Nature's Herbs, Natures Resources, Safeway Select also were potent options in that long ago test.

Which is, of course, another story. But she liked the music. My wife insisted I not sell our copy (which I had no intention of doing). I even played it very loud and no one minded!I am a Jordi Savall fan, so I saw this sampler of his stuff for such a great price and bought it. It has a nice variety - beautiful vocals, mostly nice instrumental pieces, but all very nice. Even the one (?) opera sounding piece was nice (and I don't like opera).Anyway - for the price how can you go wrong? Read some of Jordi's other reviews and then jump on it! (Just my opinion)

I bought two of these due to reviews and price - and it was the only option at local Bestbuy with a bag. First day the hose got mangled badly (see picture) and has been a problem ever since. Otherwise it is fine. We use it daily in a big house with lots of folks.Look elsewhere

This 5 disc set has gotten some good reviews. It has some of the same material as the Espana Antigua 8 disc set (not available except by import), and some different material. (See listings of material in photo section). Disc 6 and 7 in the 8 disc Espana Antigua are the same as Discs 1 and 2 in this 5 disc set.As the original reviewer mentioned - the same picture is used on both sets but they are significantly different - so beware. Some discs in the sets appear to be identical (I don't have the Espana Antigua set)- and these discs have gotten good reviews (check out amazon uk site for reviews of Espana Antigua). The enitre 5 disc set listed here gets a "bargain" assessment from medieval dot org.I figure it is Jordi (early Jordi when he was on EMI in the 1980s - but still...), and it is 5 discs worth for the price of about one disc. Definitely a bargain. And wonderful music - Savall doing chamber music!

Maybe for 10 year olds and up. GREAT MOVIE - but I, too, thought it was aimed at kids due to cartoon images on cover ("super busty" or not). My mistake.GREAT MOVIE - but includes dialogue like "your ass is grass", "lovely, huge juicy breasts", wife beating, "he didn't force himself on her", etc. And that is only in the first half of the movie.Get it, watch it, just think about whether you want your kid to see it yet.

Larry is one of the best Christian artists ever and this may be his best album. Great blues through and through - sometimes simple but well done, other times psychadelic.Frank Black named the first Pixies album after the line "C'mon Pilgrim, you know He loves ... stop acting like an idget" in the song "Watch What You Are Doing"

It sounds like Kemper tried to update his sound to the current (at the time) pop rock sound. He ends up with a very good album, but to my tastes missed the classic status of The Vigil and ArkAngel.If you are a fan - definitely get it. There are some very good cuts And the quality is consistent.But sell your TV if you have to and get His first two cds. "The Vigil" is wonderful and mellow - John Michael Talbotish - but better. "Ark Angel" is a bit like J.M. Talbot singing lead with Pink Floyd or some other top notch 70's band. (Sorry for the JMT comparisons - the only thing I could come up with. I like Kemper's voice better than JMT)I haven't heard his newer discs - but plan to get them, based on the reviews they get.There is another listing on amazon for this cd which might be cheaper: ASIN: B0002B0C96

I read this book about 15 years ago and am going through it again now. It could use some editing, in my opinion. He goes over certain topics again and again.But still 5 stars! It deals with the missing important link in social services - love and attachment! How to provide family or something family like to people who are broken.Also, another theme is valuing people over success - that caring for and living life beside the weakest of us is "where it is at." Turning culture on it's head in a way.Start by being with the broken, living in the same house as the broken. And then finally realizing you are also one of the broken. And that it is hard, but GREAT!Or something like that. Vanier can tell the story much better than I can. I have heard him speak on three or four occasions and met him twice. He seems even more genuine and loving than his book is. One time he took a "sabatical" from his work leading the L'Arche Federation and lived in a house with one of the most challenging people in his community. Sabatical?Anyway, having been around L'Arche now for 11 years and having seen not only the book and the man but some of the communities his vision resulted in - I think this book is very worth reading. Kind of a thick book - but not hard to read.

I know little about classical music but a search of reviews reveals that Kashkashian does a pretty good job playing music written for the Viola de Gamba - on the Viola - transposing the lowest notes up an octave so she can play them. Jarrett, though immensely talented and almost a household name, does only pretty well here.All in all satisfying but could be better.By the way - the Viola de Gamba is still used today - see Jordi Savallsee ASIN: B000025FOY for more info

This cd is not as easily accessible as some others. When I first bought it I thought I had made a mistake. I loved &quot;Dancing...&quot; so much that I went right out and got Humans and Inner City Front. They didn't work for me at first. After some time I came to think they are the equal to Dancing. Charity of Night is another great disc.Not that the cd is too listener unfriendly, I was just into happy pop back then. Dancing was extremely good happy jazz and folk flavored pop music. This album has some of that but also songs like &quot;strong one&quot; and &quot;loner&quot; which at first I avoided but soon grew to love. The electric violin on some of these songs is amazing! Guitar is great as always. Intelligently written music and lyrics.Definitely don't start here. Try a greatest hits or Dancing. Then seek out the Cockburn era you are most drawn to. The early folk, the lovely live Circles in the Stream, the Jazz/folk/pop of Dancing and the gradual change into rockier protest music. Latter day Cockburn doesn't do much for me - save for Charity of Night. But that is probably just me.I haven't heard much difference in the remastered version, but have only listened to it a couple times - probably not very attentively.

And deservedly so! On top of that it was so rock and roll that Christian Bookstores often refused to carry it. Produced by the George Martin Production team (yes - the Beatles producer George Martin).In my opinion - Larry has had many good cds worth buying. But there are three GREAT ones:Only Visiting This Planet is possibly the best. Rock and Pop and ballads. Amazing! Listen to anything on the "second side" for proof. Or the "first side."Second place for pop fans - In Another Land. More pop oriented. The production sounds a bit home made at times, but still excellent!Second place for blues and hard rock fans - Something New Under the Son. Blues and hard edged (psychadelic at times) blues. Another killer album (if you'll pardon the expression). The song "Watch What You're Doing" impressed Frank Black of the Pixies so much that he named their first album "C'mon Pilgrim" after part of the lyrics of that song. IT IS THAT GOOD!Other cds worth buying (check out Larry's site at guess where) are Upon This Rock, So Long Ago The Garden, Home At Last, Stranded in Babylon and Tourniquet. I own all these except So Long Ago - I liked the original version better. The one available now is Larry's preference. There may be others that are good or great but I haven't heard them.

updated 6/5/08I have had this phone for more than a year, now.The good-----+The keyboard is pretty good - it could have more height on the key domes but it works okay. Probably one of the best of the qwerty - or any phone keyboards.+The Screen is nice - 2.8 inch diagonal+The Device is small- smaller than the MDA which is almost the same+The coating looks and feels good+Some helpful programs+My faves might save you some money+Battery life is decent+T-Mobile customer service is about as good as phone companies get. Usually tied with Verizon for the best (JD Power) or just barely behind Verizon (Checkbookdotorg).+T-Mobile rates are cheaper than Verizon and ATT, and usually are as good if not better than Sprint.The not so good------------------Edge - it is okay but T-Mobile does not have 3G or faster connection yet. Sprint, Cingular/ATT and Verizon all have comparable or better devices with 3G / Ev-Do speeds. (May 2008 3G on T-Mobile NYC and soon to spread)-Memory - usable memory gets low pretty fast. You need to close programs before you open other programs usually and remember to restart it every other day. Also there is some lag time when turning on programs or waiting for the screen to change to horizontal when you open the keyboard. (UPDATE - go to howardforums to find free programs to speed up your Wing and a procedure to fix some of the memory issue. These fixes make it a four star phone I think).-Phone buttons get pushed easily in the provided holster (even with lock screen enabled - the green and red phone buttons are still active and they stick out and so you will answer calls without meaning to, or hangup occasionally).-Processor is a slow 201mhz by todays standards. While this makes for good battery life, it is disappointing to see Cingular with the 400mhz Hermes/8525 and Sprint with the 6700 and set to release the upgrade to the Hermes - the 6800 in October. (Verizon has the XV6800 now as well). All are faster machines with faster connections. And, of course, there is the iPhone with a 600+mhz processor.-T-Mobile help just told me that the darn phone will not always sync recurring appointments correctly. This is of course not a T-Mo or an HTC problem but a WM6 problem. Apparently if you put a time limit on the recurring appointments it solves the problem. Say - this recurring appointment will end after 999 ocurrences.=============Bottom line (so far for me): if you have a Dash or MDA (ATT 8125) or something comparable that is still working - save your money and wait for the next ppc. Certainly the various 6800s are better than this.If you want a qwerty ppc with touch screen - you might be pleased. It may be the best T-Mobile could do given their limited technology (no 3G in my city yet) and customer preferences (small phones are more popular).

THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE --VHS-- VERSION (Amazon will put it on both listings)(the DVD version gets 5 stars)My daughter loves Caillou (and tolerates the puppets - but that is not a big deal).I like him myself - much better than Dora, clearly better than the Berenstains and Clifford (though they are closer).This is a 40 minute tape. The DVD version is 80 minutes. Probably more expensive but you get twice the Caillou!

"Mannequin Virtue" sounds a lot like the Police in parts. Probably faster paced but less reggae influence? High pitched lead vocals, reminds me a lot of Adrian Belew's voice. Altogether pretty darn good. Sorry I can't be more descriptive."Please Stand By" is more appealing to me, but I don't remember Simple Experience - will listen again and update

(I did not see this dvd but saw the TV presentation. I am assuming the dvd does not have extra footage, which may be an incorrect assumption.)I personally enjoyed it as an adoptive father of a girl born in China. In fact we met our daughter for the very first time in the exact same room shown on this video in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province. How could I not like this?They did a much better editing job on their footage than I did on my footage!! But I still like my video better :)Especially moving to me is the mother who puts up a poster proclaiming to whoever might see it (hopefully the birth mother) that the girl she adopted is doing fine. Then a discussion ensues with local people. I wish I could find my daughter's birth mother.Also moving is the footage of the foster mother sobbing because the adoptive mother did not bring the girl to see her one last time. I understand why the new mother didn't bring her - it would have been VERY painful one more time for her daughter - but it made me think of the kind looking woman who raised our daughter for the first year of her life. We have a few pictures of her and my daughter but were unable to meet her or to contact her - still to this day.They could have added so much more, as the first reviewer said, but for what it is - it is good. Kind of glossy and feel good and cable channel quality - but still good - it does in fact hit the painful issues of previous mothers and the problem of the lack of girls in China and what that will mean in the near future for Chinese society.Some of my fellow adopters had strong feelings about parts of the movie - the footage of the foster mother in particular. But, I don't remember their points well and would not want to speak for them.And I agree about the Lucy Liu comment being innappropriate - especially considering this footage was professionally edited with a person of Chinese descent in charge! Oh well. If Ms. Ling didn't mind - should I?All in all - if you are considering adopting from China - well worth the look. Not real deep but interesting.

Amazing is a word that gets over used. But this movie is about an amazing guy. Tony Melendez is a musician who sings and plays guitar with his FEET! He was born without hands due to his mother being prescribed thalidomide.The above short summary sounds so knee-jerk over sold. But, the movie presents him as a real person who was drifting along but generally ok in his life - until he realized he could make a living singing and playing. Then he met the pope and became a celebrity of sorts, and seems to have a very healthy warm music ministry. In other words, he seems to be presented fairly and authentically.I thought the movie was well done and the story was told honestly and movingly. WELL WORTH WATCHING.

No - it isn't as good as argy bargy or east side story, but it is very good and sounds very different from those albums. The 2007 rerelease with "extra tracks" is just one extra track - a live version of 'loves crashing waves' - from the Difford and Tilbrook duo album. Not worth the cost since the original is now available at not too steep a price. I have not heard the disc - maybe the sound is better - but it was pretty good on the original disc.

I am not sure St. John's Wort will work for most people (see NIH study on SJW), but it works well for some. I was using a cheaper brand - but then that brand seemed to lose it's effectiveness. Was it me? Was I too stressed out?I switched to the brand used in testing - Kira. The SJW effect came back strongly. This works well.Start here for a few months - then try cheaper brands if you want. They may not work as well, since there is no government regulation ensuring quality.

I think Peter Gabriel tried to get his cds out on the new SACD format too fast - this one came out in early 2003 I believe. So it is not multiformat, not multichannel, and doesn't sound that much better than the remastered version IMO.A number of reviewers thought it did sound better than the remastered version - but I cannot tell much difference.

(Guess I was so excited that I found a discounted DVD-Audio that I didn't look at it carefully).The sound - even on a regular DVD player is very good. I almost kept this dvd but I really don't like opera - so despite how good Ms. Bartoli sounded I sold it. But the singer, the recording and the format sound great!

One of the best recordings of Hesperion XX (now Hesperion XXI), and the Chapel Reial de Catalunya; and in fact one of the best recordings of the music of Victory. Hesperion XX maintains the spirituality and religiosity of the works in a skillful way. The musicians and singers here are all true virtuosos. Maestro Savall is musicology in his perfection, especially in a difficult recording like this, thank you very much to the Savall teacher and his musicians....

I don't have much info to add to Todd's review. This book came out in 1988 so it has been 18 years since the stories it covers. But it does a good objective job of covering the Vineyard / "Third Wave of the Spirit" movement by covering a number of people's stories.There is a fair amount of theory in the introduction that seems both fairly deep and still readable. Then all the stories - particularly from some scholars and some previously "anti charismatic" Christians.Since a lot of the stories happened in a graduate school setting they were very impressive to me. Seminary tends to teach you to think critically, so this is not some fly by night pentecostal experience that appeals only to the uneducated.Particular tenets of the Vineyard movement that I found helpful:1) not every one gets healed or is supposed to get healed. (Wimber himself had cancer for years.)2) Tongues is fine but not the essential mark of being filled with the Spirit.3) Healing ministry is not just for the big tent or the TV but for the laity and is sometimes better done behind closed doors or one on one in privacy.4) God wants us to focus on ministry and love to the whole person - not just on healing.5) Ministers need to adhere to Biblical guidleines for exercising the gifts or the situation can become unhealthy (Wimber had to go correct a church in Kansas City cause it got out of hand).There is more - but that is enough for a flavorInteresting and informed is what I thought of the book.

Christian new wave in a style somewhat like Steve Taylor and Elvis Costello. Received rave reviews when the first disc came out. Some of the songs are ballads speed - mellow. But the better ones "kick" and have some stinging guitar. Excellent for it's era and genre. I am happy to have bought these twice - LP and CD. A popular Christian music blogger calls this his favorite album ever.

This is like John Lennon and George Harrison coming back from the dead and Paul McCartney and Ringo joining them after many years. Happy Days, and they still can put out the gems!This album does not have as many gems as the previous one - 1988's 16 Lover's Lane or the one after it - 2002's Bright Yellow Bright Orange, but it is still good to hear!

Why would anyone need to beware?I have no idea why the people reviewing here don't love this cd. I guess one guy liked it and one wasn't sure - so it gets an average rating?Oh well.

A friend who knows a lot about classical music said he was talking to the Takacs Quartet after a performance and they said they had not done this Franck piece because they believed they could not improve upon this version.If true - this is quite a recommendation.

I agree with all of what the other reviewer - James P - said. We had another video that was kind of absurd that we used for training in our agency. This one is better - but it has a low budget 70's type of feel to it. Probably cause they had a low budget and it was made a while ago.The opening dramatic presentation is very corny but to the point. The woman who stars in this video has lines that make her seem like a doofus - and so might offend some people, but no one seems too offended about it when I explain that it is hard to find good fire safety videos.The ending may seem a little over the top - 15 minutes of a real life worst case scenario - but them's the facts. This is real and important.Could be better - but it is fine for our puposes.

Side one (back when there were two sides to every album) had good country flavored pop rock. Side 2 has the amazing eschatalogical smorgasbord. Very interesting, catchy and wonderful.Alarma, doppelganger and Horrendous Disc may be better, but you have to put this one up there as well!

When it comes to classical music I don't know much. I generally like better quality recording, with good instrumentalists and that certain something in the composing that catches my interest and keeps it.This cd set qualifies on all three counts.

Seems that the Tackacs and the Talich come in at the top of every critics recommendations for Beethoven string quartets.The main point of this review is to point out that this is the Talich Quartet and it is of No 15 and 16 of the quartets.The title is incorrect and incomplete

From what I gathered after intensive (obsessive) research - there are five good makers of subwoofers. Hsu and SVS are the most highly recommended under $1000, but there are other good ones.The STF-1 is the Hsu Research lowest priced sub and is superb. The STF-2 is even more highly recommended (goes lower but is bigger).Both were more than I thought I needed. I bought a Velodyne CHT-8 (one of the other of the five good subwoofer makers) cause I didn't need "perfection" and wanted to save some money. A year later I sold the Velodyne (not a bad subwoofer) and bought this (a very good one at a good price).ecousticsdotcom is a good place to read up on subs and to search easily for professional and user reviews. Also here at this site.

I think Harville Hendrix and his line of books that started with "Getting The Love You Want" have much to offer. He posits a series of lenses or hoops that if your potential mate has a the specific qualities that will attract you - then he or she is "the one." And, if "the one" then also the one that will wound you in ways your parents did.But this is only one of the things we are unconciously looking for, he says. There are others. This is no simplistic theory.I think a lot of his ideas need research so that in the 21st century one could base their couples' work on science and not just on theory. (See John Gott). But, he does offer plenty of practical tools that can help any relationship.This is my opinion having read two of the books and gone through counseling with a therapist trained in Hendrix school of therapy (couples counseling with my significant other at the time). Many friends have really liked his books.

Like a number of other reviewers - we adopted a daughter from China and she listens to it every night as she falls asleep. Since we stay in the room with her till she falls asleep - we listen to it too. None of us have gotten tired of it after almost a year.I bought it based on the reviews here. So I am back on Amazon today to see if there is another cd by them anyone would recommend. No reviews for any of their other cds are on Amazon. Any suggestions?Thanks

Randy Stonehill albums always seem to rise to the level of the producer. Larry Norman or Terry Taylor produce = classic Stonehill album. The same with Mark Heard, at the helm for this one. Acoustic in many parts with a moving presentation of the pathos of life, this is wonderful, IMHO.

I have three Tommy Keene albums - and I wonder how he didn't become a big star. His songs are great and this is another prime example.One star deducted because his songs all seem to go to the same sound - a great sound - but after a whole album's worth it is a little redundant. This may be due to the fact that I just started listening. Sometimes with more time invested the differences unfold themselves to my untrained ear.So, well worth buying - but don't expect it to be the only cd you will ever want to listen to. It may become ONE of your desert island discs.

These are made to match the B1 speakers that are often recommended as one of the best in it's price range. The B1s have an incredible amount of bass and treble for the price and while they are not "audiophile quality" (whatever that is) they are certainly very good for the price. I should sell my B1s since I have two sets of more expensive speakers, but am reluctant to do it.The R1s - seem to match the B1s well. No drop in quality from the B1s that I can tell.The newer B1.2 and AS-R1.2 are supposedly the same as Athena did not feel the need to change this line any (said one executive). There is some talk that the larger speakers (F series) were made less heavy and therefore maybe less in quality, but it is not clear yet I believe.At the Athena website they have links to some independent reviews for more information. athenaspeakersdotcom/modelASR1Reviews.phpBy the way - when I first wrote this review I was also selling my pair to get a more expensive and better sounding pair. They sold long ago and I still feel the same as I did back then.

We had to get rid of this video - our four year old loved it but there is one short part where Linus and Snoopy hit and kick and hurt each other. Maybe back in the 60's / 70's that seemed okay for young kids to watch - but my four year old started imitating the behavior immediately after the movie. Maybe when she is older she can watch it.There is also a short boxing match between Lucy and Snoopy that seemed merely designed for Snoopy to hurt Lucy - but that one is less troublesome to me.It is a shame - pretty good movie. The crying over Snoopy leaving is a little drawn out - but otherwise it is pretty good. Just not in my house right now!

I watched a different tape - which had the Invaders but not Nothing in Dark.The Invaders is a good acting performance and it is interesting but SSLLOOWW and a little silly looking now. Little versions of the robot from lost in space attacking this woman with little flashlights and a carving knife??? For it's time it was probably good, but not now - in my opinion.

Closed headphones keep sound out and in. Sound around you doesn't disturb you and sound from the headphones doesn't disturb those around you.It is easier to make and therefore cheaper to buy open headphones. But the isolation can be real important.The A900s have one of the best reputations of closed headphones. Slightly recessed midrange sound and very large size, but comfortable and good sound.See head-fi.org and headphonereviews.org for more information and options.BTW - I modified mine with some putty and cotton to tone down the bass some - my preference. I thought the bass was too overpowering. See headfi for the mod.

I am a fan of Pinnock and Savall. I had never heard of Preston before this cd, but having Pinnock and Savall on the same cd was worth the investment for the Musical Heritage Society version which costs less than the price here.I can't say I am as floored as I am with Pinnock's work with Rachel Podger, or as swept away as I am with most of Savall's work. But I am keeping this one. The flute is not my favorite instrument, but I think this will grow on me.

Video = 3 starsDVD = 5 starsMy daughter enjoys this cartoon much more than any other video.She doesn't particularly care for the puppets - but that is not a big deal - they are only about 30% or the show. The live action segments are pretty good. The Caillou parts (cartoons) are very good.The DVD probably will cost you more but you get two vhs length show in one dvd.

I bought some M3s, then upgraded to M22s (Axiom let me return and upgrade them). The M22s are more detailed but larger. M3s would make plenty of people happy - especially for the price.I never really liked classical music till I got Axiom speakers. I had Bose and cheap Paradigms before that - both had bloated bass (though Paradigm is a good speaker line, generally). After getting the M3s and then soon after the M22s my classical cd collection grew and grew. Sometimes good speakers (and a decent receiver) can make quite a difference.I also have some Ascends which I like very much, and some Athena B speakers - which are reasonably good for the price but much cheaper than the other ones I like.

4.5 starsI like these very much - they sit in my living room (I got the beech color from the scratch and dent part of the axiom website).I also have some Ascend cbm 170s - comparable in price for their black plastic finish. The Ascends are a little better in sound - but you will pay more to get a nice finish.All told - nice speakers. Some people will say that the Energy C3s are better than these Axioms. Some people like the Axioms better than the Ascends. I think the Ascends are slightly better than the Axioms (I haven't heard the Energy speakers) but the Axiom reputation is a lot of speaker for the money.A great buy.

This is very nice stuff. I have really enjoyed disc one and disc four and plan to hear the other two discs tomorrow. Very nice oboe, viola de gamba, violin, flute, etc - all in small ensembles of 2 or 3 or 4 instruments.Telemann has a very good reputation - suffering only by comparison to Bach. Camerata Koln seems to be one of the three or four groups to pick from in Telemann chamber pieces (see penguin guide, etc.) It is very hard to find a review of this set other than the one below (rated 4 out of 5). I think it is very well done and if you like Telemann and small chamber pieces - it is great.A poor translation of the only review I could find (Amazon-France)"This anthology, that does to alternate sonatas for instrument soloist (with or without low continuos) and sonatas in trio, constitutes a magnificent example of the work prot&eacute;iforme of Telemann, so in regards to the variety of the structures (certain sonatas are in reality of the continuations) that the one of the stamps. Violin, viola de gamba, flute to beak (?)and traversi&egrave;re (old style flute), oboe and harpsichord hold alone the top of the paved or ally themselves two to two in an expressive fan that proceeds at once will of the composer to post the range of his mastery and of his desire of never to weary and to surprise also a little the listener. The Camarata K&ouml;ln dominates perfectly his subject and I will underline gladly the talent of Michael Schneider of which the flute to beak not only does not pierce the eardrums, but shows constantly an exquisite sensitiveness. An excellent general level maintains itself from one end to the other of the anthology, even if some anthologies punctually went more far in the vigor and the sonorous drunkenness (cf. S. Marq and the brothers Hanta with Astr&eacute;e). Although it in, Telemann springs grew of the listens body and the price of the set is particularly attractive."

This is one of the most beloved cds available in Christian Rock. Sounds a lot like the Eagles, and some like Larry Norman (also great - he produced it) and a lot like Randy Stonehill.Randy always seems to rise to the level of his producers - Larry does a great job in letting Randy shine. This was his first official release and the standard that all subsequent cds were judged by.

THIS IS A RANDY STONEHILL ALBUM produced by Larry Norman.Incredible album - especially created so early (1977 I think).A lot of Eagles sound but with Randy and Larry Norman's sound as well.VERY worth the investment.Note - I don't think Daniel Amos (Terry Taylor, et. al) had anything to do with this album. Larry Norman produced it. Mark Heard had no input either (though he is great as well).

At least not in the 2003-2004 edition of the Penguin guide. The Lin / LAPO / Salonen cd did.But this and the Vengerov/Rostropovich, the Chung/Previn, the Shaham/Previn and the Mintz/Abbado all seem to be neck and neck - depending on who is listening. The Ricci/Ansermet gets high praise, too.I have this album and like it very much. Might as well be a rosette in my book.

Darn - no samplesThis is one of the DA / Daniel Amos / Terry Taylor albums that straddles their avantgarde and their pop sounds. Right in the middle is where they are brilliant. Later albums were also brilliant, but less accessible.I would start here and with Alarma, Horrendous Disc, and possibly Doppleganger if you can ever find it at a reasonable price. Then, move forward from there to their more recent cds. Or try their "world famous hits" album. They shouldda been world famous and shouldda had hits.

Also well worth getting are Small Graces, Bright Avenue and Non-Fiction.

I ordered an SD card holder for my wallet that holds three of these. Include the one in my phone and I can carry around almost 16GB of tunes. Equivalent of 2 IPhones or almost as much as one 20GB mp3 player.Edit: The 6GB card is out now (9/07) ASIN:B000VUPUOUSandisk 6GB MicroSDHC (MicroSD High Capacity) Memory Card w/ MicroMate Reader (SDSDQ-6144-E11M, Retail Package)and the 8GB card should be here soon.Edit: 8GB card now (Feb 08)A couple minor problems -1) as the first reviewer mentioned - it did get stuck in my phone at first (T-Mobile Wing). But it pops right out now that I have pulled it 6 or 7 times. Whatever made it stick has worn down a bit so there is now no problem.2) I did not realize I needed an SDHC compliant card reader in order to use this card efficiently. So, I had to load mp3s on my card by connecting it through my phone - a pretty slow process. The card reader to get (so far) is the SanDisk MicroMate Reader (for SD cards) for under a twenty bill.But all the storage is great for people like me - addicted to music!

This cd gives one a taste of many different groups/solo artists who play English folk. Richard Thompson (the impeccable one!), Ewan MacColl, Albion Band, Martin Carthy, etc. No Steeleye Span or Fairport Convention, but still a good listen.A good place to start, one could also try cds 1 and 3 of this series (which I have not heard) and/or buy the individual artists. I would also strongly recommend the All Along the Ledge double album of the best by Thompson's old band - Fairport Convention. GREAT STUFF!

Japan, from their second album onwards were tremendous. I love the studio versions. This live album is worthwhile to have alternate versions of the songs. But, unfortunately this was my first Japan album years ago. Mistake. Luckily I also got Exorcising Ghosts (a best of) at the same time and was blown away.Saw it in the store a few weeks ago and realized it was highly rated by reviewers so I picked it up again. I like it since I know the songs now. But, my advice is to start with the studio albums.
