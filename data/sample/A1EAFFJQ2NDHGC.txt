Neil Young's albums have often been uneven, to say the least. Lately his recordings have sounded rather tired, with maybe a flash of brilliance here and there. Prairie Wind continues this pattern.First, if you unfold the CD booklet, you'll see a beautiful sepia-toned photo of a young woman hanging laundry on a windy day in a flat, flat land. This photo illustrates the title song, but the photo is far more compelling than the song, which chugs along for an interminable seven minutes, with a chorus of background singers pointlessly repeating "Prairie wind blowin' through my head."Most of the songs on the album are lyrically quite ordinary, the day-to-day observations and thoughts of an aging troubadour about wide open spaces, country life, family, juxtaposed with the insanity, greed, and corruption of city, politics, business. The music -- the melodies, chord structures, and song structures -- are also rather ordinary. But it is well-recorded, and it flows pleasantly. It just never seems to go anywhere.There is one song on Prairie Wind that might be construed as a classic Neil Young composition. No Wonder has enough lyrical complexity/ambiguity and musical power to be worth repeated listens. I saw Neil perform this song on the Conan O'Brien show, and it was effective.Neil sings to an old friend about his appreciation of their friendship. He sings about Elvis. He sings about an old classic guitar. He sings about the fading dream of the world he grew up in. It's all very heartfelt, but ultimately just plain boring.When God Made Me, I read in another review, might be an expression of Young's atheism. If you didn't know that, you might think it was a sincere question about how people have misconstrued or failed to see the Creator's intent, and to live accordingly. Again, this is quite sincere, but hardly another classic like Imagine.OK, you die-hard Neil Young fans -- go ahead, you can click the "No" button now. (Was this review helpful to you?) I know you've been dying to do it. Feel free, but I tell the truth. This album has one very good song, and that is not enough to justify the purchase of an entire CD. When Neil puts out another record as good as Harvest Moon, I'll be the first in line to give it five stars.

I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.As all the men on the detective squad are so "shocked" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.

I own this movie on 12" laserdisc format. Unfortunately I haven't had the laserdisc player hooked up in a long time. I've always loved this film. Certainly far above average. I only wish Nicol Williamson would have finished the Granada television Holmes series after Jeremy Brett died. That was sort of a fantasy casting idea. He is superb as Holmes in The Seven Percent Solution. And what can you say about Robert Duvall? You know he's up to the task.The DVD is out of print in the USA as of this writing (August 2009), and it costs an arm and a leg on the used market.However, if you have a region-free player, I would check the UK amazon site. You can probably get a Region 2 PAL copy of this movie for about $8 plus shipping. It's also been re-released on DVD in Australia (which the site I'm looking at says is also PAL format -- I don't know, I've never bought anything from Australia).With most DVD players, you can find a little trick with the remote to make it region-free (Google is your friend). Wikipedia's article on "DVD Region Code" states, "Most freeware and open source DVD players, such as VLC, ignore region coding. Most commercial players are locked to a region code, but can be easily changed with software." Likely you could view it on your computer with VLC player. So, if you're a fan of this movie, and you don't mind a small technical challenge... it is available at reasonable prices. I think I'm going to get the import.Update 10/2011: I did indeed buy the import, and the picture quality is fine. Since I only watch movies on my computer, it was no problem to convert it to a format that can be played with common software players. The movie appears to have been filmed largely through a gauzy lens -- i.e. the focus is soft, there is not a lot of detail. I don't believe it is a flaw in the mastering of the DVD. That's just the way the original film looks. I'm very glad I bought this from amazon.uk, as it is one of my favorite films, the best non-canonical Holmes ever done.

The Astrud Gilberto Album has a better selection of songs.Getz was surely more inspired on Getz/Gilberto and Jazz Samba.Nevertheless, this is relaxing, enjoyable cool jazz. Astrud sings on five of these tunes. She sings very well, with the classic sound we love so well. I hate the English lyrics to One Note Samba, but that's not her fault. Anyone who knows these artists probably won't be awed, nor with they be disappointed by these performances. A solid 3 to 4 stars.I have no idea where the songs were recorded. Some of them are obviously studio recordings, because the acoustics are pretty dead -- with a little artificial reverb added. Also, the fact that there is no applause after the instrumental solos is a dead giveaway. Why would they paste applause recorded on a club date at the end of these studio recordings to try to fool the listener into thinking they were live tracks? I haven't a clue.A few of the tracks are clearly live performances recorded in a small club. The sound quality is not quite up to the standard of the studio-recorded songs, but audience reactions and the acoustics of a jazz club are evident.This is a pleasant album to add a little variety to your collection of Stan Getz or Astrud Gilberto. It is a document from an era when bossa nova burst onto the American scene, and jazz songs could actually get airtime on top 40 radio and turn into big hit records.

If you want to see Fred Astaire dance, watch the movies. If you want to hear him sing -- this album (or the much pricier &quot;The Astaire Story&quot; 2-disc set from which these songs were selected) gives Fred the chance to match his many years of experience on stage and screen with just about the greatest jazz backup band in existence at the time. Oscar Peterson on piano, Ray Brown on bass, Barney Kessel on guitar, etc. This is an all-star jazz band who give their utmost to back up a singing star they respect, and Astaire, with his inimitable stylism, is obviously &quot;in heaven&quot; because he sings better than I've ever heard him sing. There is a palpable sense of mutual love and joy and respect between the musicians who made this album.To hear it is to love it. Not to knock the big band and orchestra arrangements over which Astaire sang many of these songs in his musical films, but this modest-sized jazz ensemble is obviously more suited to Astaire's singing, in my opinion. It is warm, intimate, and thoroughly enjoyable. Of course, if you like bombast, look elsewhere. If you love subtlety and the highest levels of technical improvisational musicianship, this is it.

This is a good live recording of the classic Oscar Peterson Trio with Brown/Thigpen supporting. It certainly captures the atmosphere of a small jazz club.Oscar Peterson has two sides. There is the lyrical and sensitive interpreter and accompanist. And then there is the speed-demon who perhaps overuses his gift for fast runs and embellishments. The latter I find to be a bit taxing on the ear and the ornaments a bit repetitive, tedious after a certain point. But that's my taste. Maybe you'll love it. Just be prepared on the mid and uptempo songs for flurries of notes wherever Oscar can cram them in. It sounds cluttered after a while. I'm from the school that believes the notes you don't play are as important as the ones you do, because silence creates contrast and drama.In The Wee Small Hours is an example of Oscar's more sensitive and restrained side. This version of it is a near masterpiece.Oscar is also great when he's recording as an accompanist for other artists -- for example the Verve sessions with Fred Astaire. He holds back and supports the singer, never calling undue attention to himself. I find a similar spirit reigns on his Very Tall album with Milt Jackson. There he's a true partner with Milt, and neither player steps on the other's toes.On this trio album, Oscar is center stage. Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen get little time to solo. It probably would have been a better album if they had all traded licks a bit more. I can't understand the comment from one reviewer who complained that Peterson couldn't swing. This is almost nonsensical. If anybody knows how to lay down a swinging groove, it is the Oscar Peterson Trio.The Trio Live is good listening music, and Oscar sounds very energized on the night this was taped. But honestly, this won't be one of my favorite Oscar Peterson albums. On Very Tall and Night Train Peterson holds back a little, and it makes all the difference to me.

I cannot top Charles Houser's spotlight review. He nailed it. This film is bleak as a Russian winter -- the characters are mostly family members trapped together in a house, all venting their frustrations and disappointments. And yet the viewer is made to feel sympathy with the characters and is drawn into their conflicts.I've seen this film several times, and I'm not tired of it yet. Every two years or so I will pull it out and view it again. The DVD does not greatly improve on the video quality of the VHS tape edition, but it is nice to see it in widescreen instead of pan-and-scan.Like the Beatles' Anthology CDs, this movie draws people into a rehearsal -- no costumes, no sets, virtually no props -- as if we are eavesdropping on the creative process. But the actors speak, the drab surroundings of the decaying theater fade away, and the mind begins to paint a picture of a country house, with these weary souls sniping and pleading and commiserating with one another. Though this is a film, we see the power of theater -- great actors creating an entire world with only their voices, facial expressions, and body language. Vanya on 42nd Street doesn't seem incomplete. I think a full production with sets and costumes would be a distraction. That is the canny charm of it -- using that which is missing as an asset. We are forced to focus on the performances, because there is nothing else!All the actors are superb. I wish we saw more of these people in film. Except for Juliane Moore, none of them are classically beautiful, but they are a heck of a lot more interesting than the pretty cardboard cutout people who seem to populate Hollywood and suck up all the money for their "star vehicles."

There is no point in criticizing an album for being what it is not, apparently, intended to be. When Oscar Peterson and his bandmates did their take on West Side Story, it was serious work. Part of it I liked, part of it I didn't, but at least he was thinking about how to put those songs in a dramatically new light.We Get Requests, on the other hand, is mostly well-executed fluff. I can picture sixties exectives and their wives together in their penthouse apartments, putting on this album -- to show their exquisite taste, of course -- and ordering Jeeves to bring another round of martinis. Of course, they wouldn't really be listening to the music -- it would be a pleasant tinkling in the background, an element of the carefully planned atmosphere.Part of Oscar Peterson's problem was that he had such a command of technique that his improvising was often annoyingly glib -- though very sprightly and superficially fun. It sounds as if he let his fingers do the walking, but I don't think he made much effort here to work into the guts of these songs.From my exposure to a half dozen Oscar Peterson albums, I conclude that he was usually best as a backup player for other soloists, when he had to listen hard and work around what the main voice was playing or singing -- with healthy doses of subdued chording and quiet support for the band as a whole. This imposed on him a restraint and discipline that he found hard to apply when he was the main soloist. As examples I would cite his Very Tall album with Milt Jackson or his work on Fred Astaire's The Astaire Story sessions.On We Get Requests, the trio weaves its happy way through several of the big hit songs of that era (People, Days of Wine and Roses), completely misses the bossa nova groove on two Jobim tunes (Corcovado, Girl from Ipanema), and generally seems to be having a grand time -- we're told in the liner notes that most Oscar Peterson sessions were pleasant affairs, with jokes and smiles all around. The result was the highest-class elevator music ever recorded. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It all depends on what you're looking for, and what mood you are in. Five stars!

For me, the definitive Blade Runner so far is the theatrical release. That's the one I've been enjoying on laserdisc for lo these many years. Obviously I won't be buying this DVD.I won't argue a matter of taste. If you really thought the movie was better without narration and other changes in the Director's Cut, then it is still questionable whether you should own this. If you agreed with Ridley Scott's first attempt to tamper with the film for home video, then surely there is a good chance you will appreciate his expanded editions even more.Either way, it is a good bet that you will be happier if you wait for the ultimate, primo, all-in-one set to come next year. Maybe the director will wow me with one of his new edits, but I consider Harrison Ford's narration to be a classic and integral part of the movie. You just can't tamper with that without losing the character of the original.

Of course, in the DVD format, there is no reason there should not be a director's cut release. But there are legitimate reasons that people might prefer the theatrical version. I found the director's cut to be flat without Ford's ironic noir-style narration. A lot of the classic lines from the film are from the voiceover narration, which does not appear in the director's cut.And personally, I don't feel the original ending was a &quot;Hollywood happy ending&quot; either. They are driving off into the wild blue. Whether Rachel lives 100 years or 4 years, it is not going to be a bowl of cherries. That's just the point. Deckard didn't know how long she would live, or how long he would live. That's life. And now they are fugitives. This is a happy ending?For me, Deckard was not an android and never will be. He was a crotchety, burned-out human blade runner who fell in love with an android.So I will add my voice to the chorus of people begging for a proper DVD release of the theatrical version. There is no excuse for its unavailability. The public should have its choice, just as it did in VHS. I personally own the laserdisc release of the theatrical version, and visually the mastering is not that great. We need the DVD. But hear me now, Mr. Ridley Scott, you cannot make me buy your director's cut.

Wes' playing is always great. The problem with this album is the songs and the arrangements.Wes shines when he has a great composition to work from. The middle 5 or so cuts on this CD are not impressive compositions, and the brass-heavy big band arrangements border on the kind of camp we heard in Quincy Jones' Soul Bossa Nova for the Austin Powers movies -- but Movin' Wes is cheese without the wink and the nudge. I confess a weakness for Maynard Ferguson's 1970's work, which some might consider cheesy, but I still think it was classier than this stuff. Movin' Wes I and II, Matchmaker, Matchmaker -- I could do without those.At the beginning and end of the CD, the arrangements (by Johnny Pate) are more appropriate, the songs are better -- it is four or five star material. Caravan really jumps with big band brass, and I defy anybody to stop their toes from tapping. It is only 2 1/2 minutes, but what a blast! Jule Styne's People is a beautiful slow cut, and Wes makes the most of it. The last four songs are a return to the quality of the first two. Making, as I said, a cheese sandwich.I have nothing against a jazz artist doing a pop record. Is Getz/Gilberto less of a masterpiece simply because it is easy to take, and it sold a zillion copies? Of course not. Wes' later album Tequila is also an excellent easy listening jazz record, but the songs and arrangements are more consistent than Movin' Wes. (I believe Tequila was arranged by Claus Ogerman.)Movin' Wes would have made a good Extended Play album. Skip the middle, and you've got a very nice, but very short record.

This version of the album (the original Verve CD release) combines what was -- in the old days of vinyl LPs -- the Look To the Rainbow album (11 songs) and the first half of Astrud's album with organist Walter Wanderly, A Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness (6 tunes).For me, the latter six are much better. What's wrong with the first 11 tracks? The best of these are available on other compilations. The arrangements on some tracks are a little agressive and I might even say strange, and do not mesh well with Astrud's soft gentle style of singing. Astrud herself sounds just slightly out of tune here and there on some songs, which may not bother others, but it bothers me.There's an indefinable energy, a rightness and confidence of interpretation, on her first album, the Astrud Gilberto AlbumThe Astrud Gilberto Album, that is missing on tracks 1-11 of this effort. Oh, the songs themselves on The AG Album, being largely Jobim compositions, are better than these as well.I recommend A Certain Smile, A Certain SadnessA Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness, and in fact I own it. Having that CD will make the last six tracks of this album redundant. If you own Astrud's other early albums and still want more, then go for Look To The Rainbow. It's not her best, but there are still some joys to be found if you're a dedicated fan.

I will not comment on the series content. There are plenty of reviews which cover that aspect.The image quality is very poor. Why? Because previous seasons have been pressed on dual layer DVDs, with twice the data capacity. More data means a smoother, cleaner picture, all other things being equal. Season Eight, I imagine for reasons of cheapness and utter lack of respect for the quality-conscious video consumer, was pressed on single layer DVDs. To do this requires more filtering and data compression, which in my opinion was very poorly implemented. It all leads to a fuzzy and smeared image with pixelation problems. If you're watching these episodes on a quality monitor and you have any sense of what the image ought to look like, you will be appalled.I recorded my own Season 8 of NCIS in DVD quality (720x480) from our local digital broadcast CBS affiliate. Obviously I like the series very much. The only reason I resorted to the official box set is for subtitles for a family member who is hard of hearing. It is frustrating that the quality of the commercial product is much worse than the episodes I recorded myself.There is no excuse for this shoddy presentation. Sure, people want to see the shows, and this is the easiest way to buy them. My advice -- do not pay a high price for this set. It just sucks. This is penny-pinching to the extreme on the production end. It is absolutely the worst picture quality of any television show DVD set I have seen.

The lyrics are a mixed bag -- not exactly down, but not joyful, either. I don't see many of these as great poetry. In another singer's hands, the material might fall flat. "You hit me! / Yeah, you hit me really hard / Man, you hit me! / yeah, you hit me right in the heart" (No, I do not think this song is sado-masochistic. It's a metaphor, guys.) Nina Persson is able to pull this stuff off, but I think few others could. Her ability to express longing, despair, grief, compassion, irony, all with the little quirks and twists in her beautiful girly voice is what keeps these songs rolling.Frankly, I find the musical composition better than the lyrics. I don't know what to compare it to. It has the richness and complexity that I admire in some of my favorite bands -- XTC, for example. The songs will often surprise and delight you with their harmonic changes. The production is well-done, but not overdone. As another mentioned, sound quality is superb.There is nothing on this record like Lovefool. Certainly the Cardigans are moving away from the fluffy pop candy of before. This is deeper and richer, musically. Most of the songs are moderate in tempo and volume. I don't know why some of the songs have a slight country and western flavor. It is not objectionable by any means, but a bit surprising for a Swedish band. Persson's English pronunciation is remarkably pure. She has a great ear.For me, a few of these songs will be favorites, with a lot of repeat play. The lush pop opener, Communication, is certainly a highlight. In Feathers and Down, Persson shines in a hypnotic, slowly pulsing song of encouragement. These are classic songs that grab the listener by the heart. I find many of the others musically astute, performed for all they are worth, but ultimately a little bit lightweight in lyrical subject matter. Not that this isn't fun sometimes, as on Live and Learn. I think the band would admit that they leave the philosophy to others. They are only here to entertain.The bonus DVD is a little extra treat. The videos are silly, as videos often are, but they're nice to look at. Three live tunes give you an impression of what the Cardigans are like in concert. I'm sure they put on a very competent show.This is my first Cardigans album. I am intrigued enough to sample others. They are all serious musicians, but not too serious. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I love a good kids film. Often I like them better than films aimed exclusively at adults. There is less objectionable material. Plots are not convoluted. Often there is genuine sentiment, and a moral to the story. What I do not enjoy is the increasing tendency of movies for kids to rely on kinetic energy (or wild special effects) as a substitute for good writing and acting. I think that is part of what happened with Zathura.Zathura is a movie like Jumanji -- where kids start playing a board game (called Zathura, naturally) and they enter an alternate reality -- the world of the game made real. They have to finish the game to get back to the normal world.The acting isn't very good. Haley Joel Osment and Dakota Fanning have raised the bar so high now that what used to be a passable job of acting for a child now looks silly and amateurish. I got bored about halfway through and started fast forwarding furiously to the end.Zathura is supposed to have a "moral," but that aspect is so ham-handedly written and acted that it almost seems pasted on.The game involves a series of challenges and threats, as the children journey to outer space and confront robots and lizard aliens and friendly stranded astronouts. It is mostly a succession of strange things (involving expensive special effects photography) happening every time a kid takes a turn at the game. The kids then react badly (or badly act) in fright and stumble their way through until the game ends.I don't know why this movie was made. The only thing it has going for it is a lot of action whenever the game play results in peril. In between the peril, the dialogue is dull.There are so many great kids movies, or even mediocre kid's movies, better than this -- almost any of the animated classics directed by Hayao Miyazaki, or Secondhand Lions. I kind of enjoyed Holes, and The Sandlot, too. The old My Bodyguard. The Incredibles was very entertaining.I don't know how the kiddies reacted to Zathura, but it seems like a waste of time to me. You may find yourself wishing the kids did get pulled into the black hole, just to end the movie early.

There's something to be said for the EP format -- five songs, short and sweet, reduced price. There should be no shame in releasing an EP if you can't come up with an album-full of worthy material. Think of the great debut EP from the band Ivy (Lately) or the debut EP from Air (Premiers Symptomes) -- five star efforts with five great tracks each.The best songs on Siberia can't be praised enough. They represent the best of pop music in this decade. After the fifth or sixth track, though, the music continues on, playing is strong, singing is strong, but the lyrics sound forced, the rhyming too-clever. So, the band ran out of things to say after five songs.I am mightily impressed with this music, which is my first exposure to Echo and the Bunnymen. It's got melody, a great beat, I love the way the guitar lines counterpoint the vocals, and songs like Parthenon and Stormy Weather touch me with their maturity and self-awareness.There is one other flaw with Siberia. The sound quality is very poor. The CD barely sounds any better than the MP3s of some of the tracks that I had before I bought the CD. Usually I expect the CD's higher inherent resolution to clarify the individual instruments and reveal more of the recording space. This just sounds like mud -- everything is compressed to the same volume level, the bass doesn't go very low, the highs don't go very high, and all the instruments and vocals mush together into one great mash of hash. In spite of this poor recording and/or mixing, the music itself shines through. I'm sure it would shine through more if greater care had been taken to preserve the original acoustic waveforms present in the studio at the time the record was made. Maybe the producer and the engineers need to be taken out and have their ears cleaned.

A few of the songs on S&A; seem like they fit together nicely. Too many of them seem like odds and ends of song ideas stitched together poorly. I'm talking about the music. In this respect it resembles a lot of Test For Echo, an album I listened to once and never again. I call them "Frankensongs" -- a piece of this, a piece of that. Sew it together. It's a song! Not.The frequent complaint with Geddy's excess harmonizing is valid. It is grating on the ears. Unlike Gordon Lightfoot, a choir of Geddy Lee's is just annoying. Also, I simply don't like the musical intervals he tends to use for harmonization. Further, the harmony vocals clutter the mix unnecessarily. Better a solo voice, especially in Geddy's case.I loved most of Vapor Trails, apart from the sonic sludginess, because the songs were well-conceived. A better producer could have prodded the boys to make more of the material they had for this album. Perhaps if they had reduced it to ten songs, and smoothed over some of the musical rough edges, I could be more enthusiastic.Rush has a rich creative legacy. At their age they are entitled to experiment. You are not obligated to like it, or to buy it, though. I heard my friend's copy, and that cured me. I will not buy this. Please, listen before you buy. Otherwise, you encourage them in their mediocrity.Because most of the album is such a musical turn-off for me, I didn't delve deeply into the lyrics. I find comparisons between the "fundamentalists" of the West with the religion of "convert at the edge of the sword" rather thoughtless. But beyond that, we already know Peart doesn't believe in a higher power. He's self contained, self-sufficient, the New World Man. He needs nothing but "love," but doesn't define that word. But we've heard this about fifty times before, and frankly it is just stale.That about sums up the album. Some creativity here, no doubt, but not fully-formed, and the message is starting to wear thin.

I love the Beatles and I love Cirque Du Soleil. I haven't seen this show, but I believe the remixed music would be a tremendous background for their acrobatic arts.As a music album divorced from its stage performance, I can't be very enthusiastic. The remixes are very clever. There are some very amusing juxtapositions between instruments recorded for one song added to a new mix of a different song. But I don't find these new creations having the power of the originals. Still, this is an artistic judgment and many will disagree, thinking the new equal or surpassing the original albums we have known and loved.On a purely sonic level, it was a disappointment to me. I expected greater clarity and dynamics, since George Martin's son went back to the multitrack tapes used to mix the master tapes of the original albums. That is one analog generation closer to the source, and ought to be that much clearer.In an effort to make sounds from two different songs meld into one, and trying to make all the songs have a similar sonic signature, it appears that the high frequencies have been somewhat rolled off, and the dynamics reduced a bit. It is all very homogenous from one track to the next, but I thought the end result was less immediate in most cases, less "alive" than the tracks on the original LPs and CDs we are so familiar with.As a soundtrack for a Cirque stage production, I'd have to give it a full five stars. I believe it is perfectly suited to the task for which it was created. The new mixes brought something new, creative, viable, a great canvas on which to paint with color and movement of the wonderful Cirque Du Soleil performers.As an attempt at remixing and remastering that helps us hear more detail in those vocals and instruments laid on tape in the 1960s, it is not very successful. Sometimes you can hear more of a particular instrument because it is mixed far right or left, away from the other instruments in the sonic soundstage. But that's a rare occurrence. And it honestly doesn't sound very clear. It sounds homogenized, like what compressing a CD to a low bitrate MP3 will do to the sound quality.I don't think this album will have any lasting value for me. I listened through it, hearing all the very familiar melodies and instrumental parts, being somewhat amused. But not amazed. To me it is a curiosity, and perhaps a bitter reminder that what I really crave are remastered versions of the original albums that preserve all the detail and dynamics possible, without altering the proper balance between all the individual sound elements. In short, something that gets us closer to the original master tape.

For a five star Neil Finn CD project, check out the album Woodface by Crowded House. This album is promising. The songs are very good, but the production sounds just a little too "home-grown" -- like something I might produce with an 8-track reel-to-reel tape deck in my bedroom. Maybe this "underdone" effect was deliberate, I don't know. But I think the songs deserve better treatment than they get on this record.And, lucky for music fans, these songs DO get a better treatment. Check out Neil Finn's DVD, "Live at West 54th." Here you will find Neil in fine voice, with a great band, apparently well-rehearsed, all playing with skill and heart in a small studio setting in New York City. The arrangements of the songs are better, and Neil sings them with more passion on this live disc too. Most or all of the songs from the Try Whistling This album are on that DVD. They should have touched up this concert and released it as a CD, instead of the original studio CD.If the Neil Finn DVD did not exist, then I would think this was a decent (though not stellar) album. But in light of the DVD, the CD pales by comparison. In fact, I am going to record the soundtrack of the DVD and burn it on an audio CD. Then I may never desire to listen to the studio versions (i.e. this CD) CD ever again.

The problem here is that there are five movies, equivalent to ten episodes of the TV series in length, that vary in quality. The cost is a bit high to call this a good value.Thirdspace is pretty good. In The Beginning is great. I've watched it many times. The rest are just average. Last night I saw Call To Arms, as a prelude to watching the Crusade series I just bought. It sets up the premise of Crusade, but I thought overall it was missing something.I'd recommend seeing these shows before buying the set. I can however recommend In The Beginning without hesitation. (It comes with The Gathering on the same DVD.)Babylon 5: The Gathering/In the Beginning

Too many of the reviews here sound a bit breathless, written apparently by victims of Dave Brubeck hero worship. This is a very good jazz concert, and the recording is very clean, which I appreciate. It is not, however, Perfection Incarnate.I understand that some of the cuts were edited in the earlier LP release, and that might have been a good thing. In Blue Rondo, for example, Brubeck's solo runs on and on and eventually degenerates into a slam-bangy pounding pounding pounding to little ultimate effect. Desmond's solo on that number is very sweet, but overall I think I prefer the studio version. The situation is reversed on Take Five where, oddly enough, Desmond (credited as the composer) meanders and Brubeck is the most creative.Credit is due the bassist and drummer, who really keep the show cooking. I think jazz records often slight the drummer -- drummers should be given more solos. Joe Morello gets a few beautiful chances to shine on this album.The Brubeck Quartet were more melodic and less self-indulgent than many jazz performers. But in a live performance, soloists are often tempted to wear out their welcome, continuing long past the point of having anything useful to play, and wandering off into the dissonant stratosphere. Brubeck yields a bit to temptation, but doesn't get terribly off track. He just doesn't edit himself enough. Compare and contrast with Diana Krall, a tremendous soloist who keeps her live solos generally short and sweet, and seems to have trained her band to do the same. OK, Krall doesn't generally play in 13/8 time or something, but whooop-dee-do! Brevity is the soul of wit, musically or verbally.This is an excellent jazz concert, so don't let my reservations deter you. It is not, however, a five star performance. The gods of space-time did not converge on Carnegie Hall on a February night in 1963 and inspire the penultimate extacy. But a very tight and talented jazz band did play some classic tunes, and this album superbly documents the event.

When I was a kid, I'm sure that I read some of the Star Trek books several times -- The Making of Star Trek, the original novel Spock Must Die by James Blish, to name two.As an adult, one of the books I come back to again and again is Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. This book is quite unique. It is a narrative about a father and son taking a motorcycle trip circa 1968. A real trip. You can even see pictures taken on the trip on the web, so now a reader can see the actual characters in the story. I don't know if the story was altered much to fit the design that Pirsig intended, but the trip serves as a metaphor for a rambling lecture on the nature of reality itself and our interaction with it.It is a metaphysics book. The motorcycle trip narrative is interspersed with talk of Greek philosophy, calculus, Poincar&eacute;, Pirsig's own descent into madness and return to a brittle sanity, flashbacks to Pirsig's years as a student and a teacher, and his musings on the concept of "quality." Loosely speaking the viewpoint is Buddhist, though Pirsig's metaphysics is really his own creation. I suppose one might say that he attacks a purely mechanistic view, that this way actually leads to madness. He demonstrates that there is at least one logical flaw in the scientific method, and shows why following that method slavishly cannot lead to solid, certain truth.It is very heady stuff. Not having a photographic memory, it does not stay in my mind. One can reread and marvel at the revelation of one subject after another, pulling it into his lecture (or "Chautauqua" of the mind as he calls it) about reality and quality. As the voyagers ascend the Rocky Mountains, he gets more and more abstract. In the high rockies they stop for a while, look around, rest, and then they head down to the west coast and sea level, where he tries to bring the discussion into a more down to earth, everyday realm. What does this mean for living on a day to day basis?If you are a Christian, you might wonder, how does a Buddhist book apply to me? Why should I even read this? While Pirsig aims for a combination of intuition (feeling) and experimentation, the Christian must rely on the Holy Spirit for revelation, and the Scriptures for grounding. That is for his moral life. But for everyday things like... oh, fixing a motorcycle, for example, there is not a moral or immoral way to fix it. There is a right way and wrong way. There are effective ways and on the other side there is failure. Here is where Pirsig might be more practical, for everyone. And as another reviewer pointed out below, this book might be more social commentary than philosophy anyway.Mostly though, the book is an intellectual thrill ride, a roller coaster for the brain. People ride roller coasters again and again. Or jump out of airplanes. Or climb mountains. This is a mountain climbing book -- where physical and philosophical and scientific mountains are scaled, and then you come back down, exhilarated and exhausted. And then you say, "We gotta do that again sometime!"

This is a great film. A classic. Incomparable acting and staging. Blah blah blah.This film has an English language soundtrack. It also contains two options for subtitles. French, and Spanish. HUH???I thought in the 21st century it was standard for major motion pictures released by major studios to have a closed-caption or subtitle option for English speaking persons who are hard of hearing. My hearing is quite good, but to understand the odd language of Shakespeare delivered with British accents of varying clarity is not something one can count on 100%. To say nothing of my parents, who are getting on in years and do not always understand dialog completely in the absence of subtitles.This oversight is inexcusable. And this being Shakespeare, the lack of English subtitles is far more galling than it would be on another release.MGM, confess your sin. Remaster this superb movie -- I agree it is Brannagh's best so far -- with English captions and I will recommend that EVERYONE who values culture the least little bit buy a copy.

I'm not a giant Fiona fan, but I acknowledge her raw talent, and depending on the production, her work can be impressive or disappointing. For me this album is six of one and half dozen of another. Pros and cons. On the plus side is Fiona's unique vocal phrasing, unlike Joni Mitchell's but equal in inventiveness and expressiveness. On the minus side, her voice is not as pleasant as Joni in her prime. That quaver of Fiona's needs taming as well.On the plus side, Fiona knows her music. She can craft a song with an interesting chord structure and a decent melody. Her vocabulary is fantastic, and her lyrics finely tuned. On the minus side, the subject matter of the songs is limited seemingly to introspection and romance.The big sticking point is the debate about whether the bootleg Jon Brion-produced version of the album is better. Frankly, half of these songs do not hold my interest in either the Brion version or the official version. The new producer definitely ruined the track Better Version of Me. The Brion version was not perfect, but much much better. Try to find a copy of this track -- it is worth the trouble. I can't even stand to listen to the album version. What were they thinking? The piano sound is horrible, the rest of the band sounds bored and sickly.Some great songwriting is on display. Extraordinary Machine (the song) is a little chamber-pop masterpiece. The artistic highlight of the album is Red, Red, Red. This syrupy-slow lament kicks me in the gut every time. Amazing. Some complained that this was toned down from the bootleg Brion-produced version, but my recollection of that early track is that it verged on histrionics. The new vocals are more subtle, and way more effective. In fact, I would describe most of the vocals on this album as more thoughtful than the ones in the bootleg mixes. Some people apparently interpret this as lack of passion, but that's a very superficial read in my judgment.Get Him Back runs on just about a minute too long, but apart from that, it's a great song. O, Sailor also runs on too long. These are good songs, but they wear out their welcome after four minutes, as almost any song does, no matter how clever. Fiona attempts to use dissonant piano chords in several songs on Extraordinary Machine, for effect. This device is successful in Get Him Back, but all it does for O Sailor and Oh Well is make them sound off-kilter and out-of-tune.Not About Love is not dissonant, but it is needlessly stop-and-start jerky, changing tempos and moods every few lines. Bah! This is not songwriting. It is musical schizophrenia.The album ends with a nice normal song, Waltz, which might sound right at home in some Broadway musical. Given her innate theatricality, perhaps that is where Fiona should direct her efforts in the future. Sure would beat Andrew Lloyd Weber, at least.All in all, this is a problem-plagued album. Some of the problem rests with the songs themselves, some of the problem is with underproduction or overlong repetition. The highlights are Extraordinary Machine, Get Him Back, O' Sailor, Parting Gift, and Red Red Red. Is that enough to justify the album? Some of the songs are so good, I was really rooting for the rest, but they simply did not make the cut. I give a 3 star rating, plus an E for effort. Like the artist herself, this album is an uncontrolled force of nature, sometimes awesome and sometimes annoying.Fiona shows many signs of maturing, musically and lyrically, compared to her previous album, When The Pawn. I hope she'll keep writing, and someday she is bound to find a producer who can show her work in the best light by taming her excesses. In some ways, both producers she worked with on this album failed her. Jon Brion might have done a better job on average with this new material, but ultimately that doesn't matter. If they released the Brion mixes, I couldn't recommend those as a whole, either. Perhpas it is best to pick the tunes you like and buy them separately, if possible.

I'm not really sure why Bonnie Raitt continues to make studio albums. Apart from the title track, I thought the last record was a dud. This one? Some pleasant tunes are covered here (nothing but covers, Bonnie composed none of the songs), but only two or three that I might consider listening to more than once.Road Tested was/is an amazing album. Get the DVD if you can. Preceding it, you have Bonnie's classic 1970's work, Nick of Time, and a few tunes on the albums that followed it, which stand the test of time.Clearly, she continues to be a compelling performer, but she's at the mercy of the material. Most of these songs do not inspire me or even entertain me that much. None can in any way be compared to the bumping, grinding Love Letter, the raucous Thing Called Love, or the gut-wrenching I Can't Make You Love Me.The recording quality and production on this disc are excellent. Better, in fact, than on Nick of Time. But production cannot turn a mediocre song into a classic. My advice is to listen to a stream of this album somewhere on the internet if you can find it, or check out a copy from your library to preview it. Make sure you know what you're buying.I would love to purchase a Bonnie Raitt CD of new material that met the standards of her older work. This is not that CD. When I want a dose of Bonnie, I'll have to content myself with another listen to Road Tested or Sweet Forgiveness.

This Jimmy Stewart star vehicle was released in 1965, so I could have seen it as a kid. But I didn't. Usually we attended blockbuster musicals and comedies.When I say this is a star vehicle for Stewart, I mean that he gets more lines than anyone else, and he gets all the good lines. There are a fair number of good lines in this movie, which tells the story of a Virginia farmer who tries to keep himself and his sons out of the Civil War raging all around him. He is successful at tending his own business exclusively (he doesn't believe in slavery and finds no reason he or any of his should fight for it) until the war finds him. The South tries to requisition ("steal") his animals, which leads to an altercation. His youngest boy is carried off by mistake by the North as a prisoner of war. Dad sets off to find his son. The family does not remain unscathed, due to bad men and bad luck.Shenandoah is probably one of the last Hollywood films that is unabashedly religious in underlying orientation, in the old style of the 1940s and 50's. Though Stewart's character has, shall we say, a strained relationship with God, he keeps his family tied to the church -- to fulfill his wife's final wishes. There's a very effective scene at the end where he talks to his wife Martha at her grave, longing for her to be there to give him some comforting words to help him deal with the tragedy he has just endured.It's a simple story, effectively told. You could say it was an anti-war movie, but without the trappings of modern anti-war films, which tend to end up being anti-American. This film is more anti-government, in my opinion. Libertarian in outlook.A fine film that is true to its era and still holds up today. Stewart knew how to pick his projects.

I thought Luc Besson directed this, but it turns out he is the producer (and a writer). I do like some of Besson's movies, particularly Femme Nikita and The Professional. Likewise, I've always felt Liam Neeson's films had a certain level of class.Taken is written at a surface level. The characters are not developed very deeply, and the movie is mostly about intrigue and action -- a bit of the former, but mostly the latter. Action is of the Jason Bourne type -- walk into a roomful of bad guys and render them all helpless in 15 seconds. A little unrealistic for a man of any age, let alone Neeson's. Think Indiana Jones in revenge mode.As a pure action movie, it is competent and exciting, if a bit formulaic. I'm afraid that I've seen enough of these types of films that the sheer kinetic energy of some of the scenes is not enough for me. I think a quieter, more sleuth-like sniffing out the trail leading to the hero's kidnapped daughter would have been more dramatic, even if it induced less adrenalin. And a lower body count, with slower kills of the really really bad guys might actually have been more cathartic.The ending seemed a bit abrupt. For example, there's no exposition on how the French authorities cleaned up the messes our hero exposes and leaves behind, and how they deal with the corruption in their midst. I wanted to see that resolved.And while the cause seems just, I'm still just a bit uncomfortable with the special forces-style vigilantism that is glorified here.If you don't want to think too hard, and watch a lot of nameless sinister folk get quickly shot or pummelled into submission, Taken will occupy you for an evening.

This is a charming album. The sound is dated, yes, but the remastered edition is luscious. The instrumental and vocal timbres are very warm and sweet.The only caveat I have is that the vocals are not as solid as The Astrud Gilberto Album. That one sounds very confident throughout. Here, some of the singing sounds tentative. Maybe that by itself may be appealing to some listeners. I do not have that reaction. It sounds like Astrud was not entirely comfortable with the some of the songs or wasn't thoroughly familiar with them.Also, on Fly Me To The Moon Astrud never sounds exactly on-key, which is a bit disconcerting. Who Can I Turn To is similarly afflicted. It makes me wonder if she was unable to hear the orchestral playback properly. I don't know the cause, but it should have been corrected before release.Still, some of the songs here are utterly confident and among the best Astrud ever recorded. Manha De Carnaval floors me with its beautiful guitar arrangement and simply wonderful unadorned vocals. The title track and Aruanda are complete successes. I have always loved The Gentle Rain -- I even own the original soundtrack LP. Astrud's version is a worthy variation on the song.For me this is a worthwhile CD, one that I come back to repeatedly, in spite of its objective flaws. I only wish Verve would release a reasonably priced remaster of Astrud's first album that equals the sonic authority and beauty of Shadow Of Your Smile. Review Update July 2009: Last year, Verve did just that -- remaster The Astrud Gilberto Album. High time they did.The Astrud Gilberto Album

Ben Stein is a "celebrity" of sorts, and his name is associated with money, hosting the TV game show Win Ben Stein's Money. It is only natural for him to write an investment book. I don't know why Stein and his co-author decided to promote this particular investment strategy. Nevertheless, I think this book would familiarize novice investors with some essential terms and concepts, so it might be a good introductory lesson in investing.For a system to use for real investing, I would recommend perusing the columns of Paul Merriman and Mark Hulbert on the CBSMarketWatch website. They have tracked the performance of a simple moving average market timing system. It is about as good as buy and hold, but with less risk, because it takes you out of the market in severe downturns. You have to religiously follow it, of course, even when all your emotions are telling you the opposite. This is a problem with any trading system, of course.Another system followed by Hulbert is seasonal investing -- only being in the market at certain times of the year when gains are most likely.With a little effort, one can find better market timing systems -- the information is free on the web. However, I've read Stein's books for basic knowledge. I refuse to follow his ideas slavishly, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else do so, either.

Having enjoyed the first two seasons of Roswell, I wanted to enjoy the third season. I did up to a point, but objectively the series fell apart in the third year, and was brought to a merciful end after 18 episodes. This makes the season three set a poor value in both quantity and quality -- four shows short of a normal season of television, and deficient in imagination, continuity, and overall execution.I believe the young actors in this series improved throughout their tenure in Roswell, but this is against the backdrop of declining script quality. The writing ignored logic at so many points, that anyone not in the grip of blind fannish adoration for this series would be quite annoyed.To top it off, Jonathan Frakes produces some of the most inane audio commentary for a TV episode I've ever heard. Announcing the characters and actors as they come on the screen -- like we don't know who the stars of the show are???What led to the demise of Roswell is probably the lack of a good story arc for the third season. For the first half of the year, Max was looking for his son, taken from him in season two by the duplicitous Tess (played by Emilie de Ravin, currently appearing in LOST on ABC). Then, Max loses interest in that quest. Isabel inexplicably abandons all caution and common sense, marrying a man she has known but a few short months. Inevitably this leads to conflict, since she decides to deceive him about her alien heritage. When her ex-lover from the home planet shows up on their honeymoon, more silliness ensues. Michael and Maria are together, then they split up, then they get back together, kind of, and finally Maria decides to commit. Colin Hanks comes back as a ghost (sort of) in one episode -- which seemed like an act of desperation to me.Certainly there are enjoyable moments, and fans of the first two seasons will want to see the third. But keep your expectations low. Probably one of the best shows of the year, the one that is truest to the characters, is the episode about what the gang did on New Year's Eve. Maria and ex-Sherriff Valenti get to show their musical talents in several shows, Valenti with his country rock band the Kit Shickers, and Maria with her guitar in an aborted attempt at a recording career. I actually enjoyed the musical bits. The band Ivy puts in a cameo appearance in the wedding party.Season three was a year of crazy capers, confused lovers, badly choreographed fights and action scenes, and villians with about as much depth as cardboard cutouts. And don't forget a healthy dose of stupid, stupid writing. None of it really adds up to much, and in the end, a prophecy of doom leads the aliens and their human posse to abandon Roswell. The epilogue, which informs us via a voiceover that Romeo and Juliet eventually marry, is hardly fitting. We wanted to see the series mature and actually experience that wedding in a future episode. The first and last episodes of the season are reasonably good, but overall Roswell ended its TV run with a whimper, not an antimatter explosion.

I enjoyed the original album tracks much more with the cleaner, remastered sound on this Deluxe edition. The individual guitars and keyboards and vocals stand out more, whereas on the original CD release they seemed to blend in together into homogeneous sonic pudding. The remastering lets you hear the complexity and mastery of the mixing. And the soaring vocals are purer and smoother as well. I should add that the original US vinyl (if in prime condition) is more detailed and vivid than the Deluxe Edition CD, though that might not be a practical option for a lot of buyers. The Deluxe CD sounds very good, and if you can reproduce it properly, the original vinyl sounds very, very good.Few of the Deluxe extras are of much use to me.Most if not all of the B-sides are available on the earlier release "Saturnine, Martial, and Lunatic," which I already own. I found the B-sides so-so, except for Pharaohs, which is a beautiful keyboard chord progression mixed with a recording of a British weather report and snippets of guitar phrases from Everybody Wants To Rule The World. All in all, it's a fine combination. Unusual, but peaceful and pretty.Some of the 7" single mixes are nice, and would make nice tracks to transfer to your MP3 player for a bit of variety. The 7" single mix of Everybody Wants to Rule the World seems exactly the same as the album mix, except perhaps the equalization is a little different. I'm not sure, but they are very very close.I had a hard time getting through the 12" singles. They were elongated, stripped down, and/or weirded-up versions of the originals. They simply didn't sustain my interest, and artistically, I thought they took away from the originals rather than added. Honestly, I think 95% of all song remixes are inferior and not worth the bother. Nothing in this Deluxe Edition has changed my mind on that.The booklet contains one article/interview about the band and the making of this album. When asked how he feels about the album today, Curt Smith says, "...I just think we're a lot better at what we do now. So it's like looking back at schoolwork you did."That is my impression of the album as well. There are some brilliant spots, and overall it is a good album, but I think Tears For Fears went on to greater heights artistically following Songs From The Big Chair. The better mastering on this new release helps me appreciate what they achieved, but it still isn't my favorite TFF album, and the Deluxe Edition contains a lot that is only of interest to hardcore fans and completists.Four solid stars. Although, I really ought to deduct another half star because there is NO LYRICS INCLUDED IN THE BOOKLET. Grrrr. For this price? No lyrics? Hmmph.

I thoroughly enjoy Oscar Peterson's playing in certain contexts. He is a very respectful collaborator -- backing up Fred Astaire on the Astaire Story album, or sharing the stage with Milt Jackson on the Very Tall sessions. Oscar is more enjoyable to these ears when he holds back a bit.Here, in a live trio club date, Oscar is unbound, unleashed. What that means most of the time is unending flurries of notes. They are very well-played notes, mind you, but to me it gets a little tedious compared to a soloist like Ahmad Jamal or Miles on Blue In Green, where space is given its due, and improvised lines are heard without as much baroque ornamentation. This is a matter of taste, and you may prefer the excitement of Oscar's full-on "never let 'em catch their breath" approach in this classic trio record. I only want to describe the sound of this album to help customers know what they're getting. This is not an album like Night Train. Oscar stretches out, plays with greater intensity and less melodicism, and the songs are longer, so this can lead to a bit more rambling in the solos.To be fair, Oscar does slow down on more melodic pieces like Jim. And I like a lot of his inventions in On Green Dolphin Street, though his opening and closing on that tune is grandiose -- it's a bit much. Billy Boy closes out the album, short and sweet.It's likely that some jazz fans are able to decipher Oscar's quick runs better than I, and will derive much more enjoyment. In building my collection, I am going to try to focus on the albums where Oscar's lyricism is uppermost. Therefore, I will not be buying this. Again, it may be perfect for you.

Here is a record of 16 mostly too-long examples of an artist playing with himself. They have the character of a late-night experiment in a musician's home studio. Some of these songs actually have a melody, which is repeated over and over and over and... you get the picture. Other tracks seem to float along on an endless chord progression with little identifiable melody or structure. Undoubtedly there is a melody and structure, but one is not motivated to listen a second time to draw it out.This album is sparse, moody, reverberant, funereal, repetitious. As the title might imply, bits of these songs would be appropriate as a soundtrack to a ghost story set in a western ghost town. Frisell plays a variety of electric and acoustic guitars, with some tape loops of feedback and other guitaristic oddities, noises, and fretwork. This is a solo project, but not solo guitar -- Frisell accompanies himself with multitracking. I like his guitar sound, but it needs to be placed in the context of a full quartet or band to make a complete musical statement.Was this album made as an act of self-indulgence or for the purpose of revenge against his record company? Listening to this will take an hour from your life you can never get back. I find some of Frisell's other work to be modestly interesting, but very little is happening on this record other than the effect of spontaneous and absent-minded jamming. This comes out as the audible equivalent of sexual "self-pleasuring." I hope it was good for him, because I was bored out of my mind.

The first season of 24 was very manipulative, but that manipulation was so skillful that the viewer didn't mind. I had never before watched a TV show that got me as emotionally worked up, waiting for the next episode to continue the story.Whereas season one strained credibility, season six took credibility out in the alley, beat it senseless, and then shot it in the head -- which sounds like something Jack Bauer would do.For me the show started to become almost laughably bad by the second half of the season. I felt that the characters had become cartoons, fumbling their way through ridiculously contrived new plot developments to fill out 24 shows.My friend still wants to see this season against my advice. I will give him my broadcast TV recordings of season six to watch, but I don't believe the DVD set is worthy of a purchase. I give two stars because there are isolated parts of the show that are satisfying. Unfortunately the plot was unable to integrate those occasional good pieces into a coherent whole.

Byrd and his band are their usual musical and highly competent selves. Hamilton's sax is smooth as silk. It's hard for me to review this album because I can't really find anything to criticize.The recording quality is very good. The songs have strong melodies, and the improvisations never veer off into atonality or astringency. It is relaxing, but not boring. Perhaps it isn't the ultimate in virtuosity, but I think I could call it near-virtuoso. The ensemble has a coherent "tight looseness" -- the musicians are all together, but the music isn't mechanical.I'm sorry to see this album is out of print and not a big seller. For my money, and for my listening pleasure, this album is better than Byrd's huge 1960's success Jazz Samba with Getz.The biggest compliment I can offer is that I've played it many times and I'm not weary of it. When I see it on the shelf, it is like an old friend that I want to spend some time with. When I play it, it makes me smile inside. If you're looking for avant garde, look elsewhere. If you want straight ahead jazz in the smooth lyrical Stan Getz or Vince Guaraldi mode, I think this fills the bill.

I will concede that this was one of the best pictures of the last year. It is a great Batman movie, though perhaps it has received more praise than it deserves as a "philosophical statement." Primarily it is a great action movie that does not cheat characterization and motivation of the characters.My comments here are on the technical quality of the DVD visuals. I watched on a 900x1440 monitor, and while some scenes looked very good, on other scenes there was easily visible quantization noise (mosquito-like noise) and detail was washed out in some background items like buildings -- i.e. they looked a bit blocky. This looked like a careless transfer to DVD to me, compared to other hit movie DVDs I've seen.I have not seen the Blu-Ray, but from all accounts it is very good. Based on what I see, I will probably wait until I have a Blu-Ray player before I purchase this movie, unless I can pick up a used DVD copy for a few bucks.It's a five-star film, but the DVD is average, at best, in transfer quality. So let's make it a four-star rating on the DVD package. By the way, it needs to be mentioned that the DVD has been mastered with built-in data corruption (in the name of anti-copying measures) which may cause some computers to balk at an attempt to view it. (My PowerDVD6 OEM was able to manage the disc just fine.)

Lost in Translation has many things going for it. The cinematography alone justifies the movie for me. The film is understated and quiet. If you have the attention span of a squirrel, then do not rent or buy this film. If you have any sense of patience, allowing a film to organically unfold, you will be rewarded.Bill Murray is great, playing what I think is essentially himself. I think the core of the movie is his interaction with the Japanese people and culture, not the friendship/romance. The relationship with Scarlett Johanssen consists of them simply recreating together -- drinking, dancing, karaoke. Only in one scene is there any serious conversation between the two. Is there any *there* there? Not really. Johanssen doesn't have much to do, either, except mostly react to walking through Tokyo and Kyoto and staring out her hotel window.Still, the film doesn't take any wrong turns or destroy its credibility. It is just a quiet, sweet meditative little movie. Probably the great reviews and excess hype will work against it now. People will expect too much.And, I'm sorry, but the Japanese as depicted in this movie are just plain weird. From our point of view, inscrutable. So we have a good-natured and affectionate chuckle at their expense. Not having been to Japan, I cannot say how much the film exaggerates their strangeness. Even if this film is essentially accurate, I wonder if the Japanese themselves would be able to explain their behavior. The film does not even attempt to help us understand.

I won't attempt to describe the film's philosophy or deeper meaning. The greatest tribute I can give is that I've watched it over a half-dozen times, and I'm not tired of it yet. It is one of a handful of films I go back to repeatedly, and revel in the atmosphere, the characters -- brought to life so vividly in this film with expert writing, beautiful cinematography, and flawless performances by the actors.I find the acting in so many films of this era rather corny and amateurish. Perhaps it is the direction, perhaps they were inspired by the script, but the subtlety and believability of the acting measures well against modern standards.Technically this is nearly the best one could hope for in a DVD transfer. However, on a double layer DVD such as this one, with a capacity of 9 gigabytes of data, even more space could have been devoted to the film itself, less to the extras like two vintage Third Man radio broadcasts, which should not need many bytes. Because the film is so grainy -- authentically so (and I personally like the effect of film grain, especially in a noir film such as this) -- technically this requires a lot of digital bits to properly reproduce. The DVD looks great, but it would look even better if raised to "SuperBit" data rates in the encoding stage. But, this is a minor quibble.I love the look of the film and the people in it. The only thing I don't care for is the zither music, which I find slightly annoying at times. However, I believe it captures somehow the atmosphere of postwar Vienna, and as such I accept it.Finally, the centerpiece of the film -- a conversation between Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten -- is such a classic that everyone should see this movie once, if only to hear Welles' speech. I wonder how many Star Trek fans noticed that this dialogue was ripped off by Deep Space Nine writers in the episode Business as Usual, where Quark becomes an arms dealer who faced with the moral dilemma of killing millions for the sake of profit?For the cinema afficianado, this is one you want to keep and cherish. The casual movie lover needs to view this classic film at least once. I believe it is deserving of as much praise as Casablanca.

This album is not what I was expecting, but it is mostly well done. Deodato did the arrangements and conducts throughout. This is really HIS album, more than Astrud's. Astrud is absent on two songs. (One of those -- pure instrumentals -- is a tasty arrangement of Steven Stills' To A Flame.) Turrentine shows up only on only four cuts. There is probably less improvisation on this album than on Deodato's hit CD Prelude, but the Deodato touch is very familiar. He makes arrangements that are easy to listen to without becoming completely cheesy, and he leaves room for the instrumentalists to improvise. However, I didn't feel that the spotlight was on Astrud. She became a central voice in Deodato's little symphonies.Astrud's vocals range from wonderful to a little embarrassing. Zazuiera in particular sounds tentative and sort of dashed together. She is rarely exactly in tune on this song. On the other hand, Burt Bacharach's Wanting Things is just beautiful, touching. The best cut on the album is probably Brazilian Tapestry, bringing together the best of Deodato's arranging, Turrentine's sax, and Astrud's vocals.I don't like the way Astrud's voice was mixed. Ponteio and Traveling Light sound normal. On some of the other cuts, her lower range is boosted, and the upper middle and higher frequencies are sucked out, removing any hint of breathiness or reediness in her voice. What's left is the fundamental note, plus the sibilants at the extreme high end. It sounds heavy and thick. The audio engineering could have been improved on in this regard.What we're left with is an album with many good individual tracks that make for pleasant Sunday brunch-style jazz listening, but is not in any sense a cohesive whole. I recommend the album. In fact, I've enjoyed it very much. I just wasn't prepared for Deodato being the mastermind.By the way, I would recommend the European Import "Master Series" version, ASIN: B0000AM6RE, currently available through Amazon marketplace sellers for less than $9 plus shipping. Look carefully through the Amazon listings, and you will find it. It contains three bonus tracks, not very consequential ones, but still. Also, the overal sound quality is quite pure and clean, apart from the heaviness apparent on some of Astrud's vocals. (It is an HDCD disc.)

I'm giving this a generous three stars for an album that would make pleasant background listening for grilling steaks or sorting the washing. Other reviewers must be given credit for detecting spot-on the problems with this album. There is, as one put it, little melodic or rhythmic innovation, including the meandering guitar solos, which seem to be the rule with WB these days, not wanting to bother to craft anything with a melody, like the stunner he did for Josie back in the days. These new tunes all seem to blend into one another in memory -- they all sound like variations of the same song. Sorry, but nothing here grabs me.To even mention Aja (the whole album) in the company of this new CD is to point out just how far standards have fallen. Each one of those old tunes was a model of composition, crafted with perfectionism that bordered on insanity. And I can't believe the reviewer who slighted Two Against Nature for including Cousin Dupree, clearly the best track on that disc. Yes, this one seems to lack anything as catchy or slyly perverse. In a word, it sounds tired.In fairness, kudos must be sent to the boys for putting a stream of Everything Must Go online, so that people could decide if they want to shell out full price for such a modest effort. I for one do not, and thank Becker and Fagen for the preview. Perhaps when it is legally available for download at a modest price (i.e. when the record industry finally comes to its senses) I would consider purchasing. Or, I will wait to get it through the CD clubs for an average price of $ or under.The last album took 20 years. What was the rush?

I'm giving this new mix 4 stars, whereas the original Let It Be would get 3. The new track order is better, and the sound is very clear. However, if you own the Phil Spector-produced original and The Beatles Anthology 3, I think this new mix is mostly superfluous.Get Back, Dig A Pony, For You Blue, Two Of Us, I've Got A Feeling, One After 909, and I Me Mine, all sound substantially the same as the classic Let It Be CD. The sound is undeniably cleaner, and Ringo's drums seem to have more kick, but on I've Got a Feeling, the engineers have removed the some of the necessary bite from the electric guitars. Solo instruments are mixed lower in volume, like the slide guitar on For You Blue. The new &quot;Naked&quot; mix giveth, and the new mix taketh away.Don't Let Me Down was always a throwaway song to me, and its inclusion here doesn't add any value. The version on The Beatles' Past Masters Volume Two is sufficient, and probably superior.Anthology 3 was mostly a collection of archival junk that should have stayed archival, but it contains George Martin's remixes of The Long And Winding Road and Across The Universe that beat the Naked remixes. George Martin was a genius, and the team of producers for Let It Be...Naked cannot match his judgment.I am forced to conclude that the only song on Let It Be...Naked that substantially bests previous versions is the rousing Let It Be, which now closes out the set in the new track ordering. But even this track is marred by a lackluster George Harrison guitar solo, clearly inferior to the solo on the original CD and the other solo that graced the original single.This is a fine purchase for those who do not own the first &quot;overproduced&quot; version of this album. For Beatles fans who already own the previously released versions of these tunes, it hardly seems worth the bother. At the very least, it would be wise to borrow a friend's copy before paying good money to go... Naked.

Three and a half stars, really. This was a romp for the XTC boys, a bit of fun, a bit of a joke, with fabulous songs that both pay homage to and poke fun at the psychedelic pop era.But this is not serious enough, it doesn't have the lasting value to merit the five stars that many overenthusiastic reviewers have given.Don't let me discourage XTC fans and fans of pop in general from buying this CD. It is better than 97% of what is released into the marketplace. Still, you can't honestly put this on a level with XTC's Oranges and Lemons, a true five-star effort.

I haven't heard all of Stan Ridgway's albums, but I was apalled to find that Partyball was one of his lesser-rated efforts according to customer reviews. I am determined to set that record straight. At the outset, I should state that I found Wall of Voodoo to have little appeal. Apart from a few cuts on the Call of the West CD, Wall of Voodoo was Stan Ridgway in the sandbox, playing around with words, sounds, and noises -- a preparatory step toward making real music. I bought two Wall of Voodoo CDs, and sold them both. After Stan left the band, they actually improved, especially the purely musical aspect of their work. Stan's songs for Voodoo were sparse, vestigal, primitive. This is mostly where I find fault with Voodoo. The lyrical tales may have been adequate to make great songs, if the musical accompaniment had been better. But I couldn't get past the poor guitar playing and bad arrangements.When Stan went solo, the quality jumped. Each album saw a step forward in sophistication, with Partyball at the peak. It is almost a fully realized effort, with excellent production, track sequencing, clever little interludes, tremendous energy in performance, and breadth of subject matter -- always with the point of view a little askew, but suiting perfectly Stan's oddball vocal style.Partyball begins with Jack Talked (like a man on fire), a herky jerky tale of insanity, which Stan punctuates by half shouting, half singing, and twisting his mouth around the strange lyrics ("he took personality tests, and stapled them to his lower lip"), sounding as if he is on the verge of an appointment with a straightjacket himself.I Wanna Be A Boss remains Stan's magnum opus. This tale of dreaming castles in the sky builds to a near-symphonic climax, never faltering, perfectly expressing the escapism of the working class trapped in 9-to-5 drudgery.The hits keep on coming, with Roadblock, a classic Ridgway "fugitive song," a verbal portrait of small town America. A community lies in wait to ambush a man with "crazy eyeballs jumpin' left and right in time to an 8-track playing Foghat" as he drives unsuspectingly into the sherriff's trap. But at the end, everyone gets an unpleasant surprise.Stan gets a bit more abstract on the creepy Snaketrain and the tender (I See) Right Through You. These are also beautiful songs in their own way, the latter a genuine heartbreak that I find strangely moving.With Gumbo Man we are back into the subject of shady underworld characters. The cheesy 60's organ solo beats all, and Gumbo Man is so infectious they actually played it on the radio in our town.Harry Truman is more muscially contemplative. If its meaning is obscure, it is no less seductive. John Lennon's Come Together never made any sense, either. The slithery guitar playing oozes cool -- this song slides down like an oyster.Overlords is a like a little science fiction movie. The characters are counterparts to the poor grunts in I Wanna Be A Boss, only this time their bosses are intergalactic slave-drivers. I suppose this song is a little mundane, but it's still fun.If Partyball flirts with insanity at the start, at the end, it dives right into the deep end of the pool. One can make little sense of Uba's House of Fashions, but I cannot resist Stan's psyched and psycho delivery, as he sings about the strange goings-on in this high-class dress store, long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away. The music marries beautifully with Stan's vocal histrionics, and then the song starts running BACKWARDS, complete with guitar solo. To my mind, this is another Ridgway classic.I consider Uba to be a fitting end to Partyball. Beyond Tomorrow is more like a bonus track. The band sets up a groove and Stan raps for six minutes, lyrics that sound like a cross between Futurama and notes scribbled on an LSD trip. Surely this is the weakest cut.Partyball is produced by Stan Ridgway. This is his vision, and he deserves the glory. It sounds as if he had a bigger budget on this album, and used it wisely, to craft the arrangements and songs with changes in mood and instrumentation and vocal delivery to keep things interesting. At the risk of repeating myself, I Wanna Be A Boss is a masterpiece. Stan is magically on target with Partyball -- he could do no wrong. The songs are melodic -- as melodic as Ridgway gets, anyway. He knew exactly how to voice the band and his own vocals so that everything "gelled." I haven't heard all of his subsequent albums, but lately his production style has been a little too spare for my taste. (There is some beautiful work on the Anatomy CD, though.) If you want prime Ridgway, this is the collection you should buy.Five stars, without reservation. (And pay attention to Robert Moore's review, below. Oddly, he was as perplexed as I that this album did not rate higher among the fans.)

I was going to give this album three stars, but I saw the other two reviews and wondered, 'Could I perhaps be wrong???' So I'll grant it four stars which is probably over-generous. Honestly, the last two cuts are great. The rest of the songs didn't make me want to come back for more. Blossom gives them as good a performance as they could be given. That's not the point. The songs themselves seem kind of... well, ordinary. Your mileage may vary. I think I could safely say, though, that if you are new to Blossom Dearie, this album probably would not be the best representation of her art.

This record mostly grates on me. Often Osborne is pushing and straining her voice, which is good for expression when used moderately, but a lot of the songs plug along at the same intensity for 5 minutes, and it is just tiring, even on a pretty good song like Right Hand Man.Lumina is also probably a fine song, but it sounds like a demo, with a poorly recorded vocal and a lone unadorned electric guitar. This composition never has a chance to get off the ground.Let's Just Get Naked also seems like it could be a fine song. Joan affects a different character in this vocal, evoking a ditzy, drugged-out groupie type of girl. But the tempo is too slow, the dynamics never change much, and the whole mess grinds on for five minutes without anything to break the monotony.Man In The Long Black Coat is one of the few classic Dylan compositions of the last 20 or 30 years. Joan's version doesn't even begin to touch the creepiness of the original. Pointless.The song that drew most people to this album, One of Us, is really a very amusing song, and raises some interesting questions. As the theme song to TV's Joan of Arcadia, I didn't even know Joan Osborne sang it -- she sings so sweetly, with none of the strain and grit in her voice that she so often uses. She sings it sweetly on this album version too. Obviously much care was taken in production to get this signature tune just right. I like it.This record shows potential, but her album Righteous Love was a greater success musically. The song Running Out Of Time from the Righteous Love CD is more exciting than anything on Relish. There is enough material here for a decent EP, but it could have been so much more. There isn't enough for a main course, just some relish on the side.

I confess I don't know quite how to review this album. I'm not a New Age music fan by any means. When I found this album at the thrift store in brand new condition, I decided to give it a try. I knew it had been a big seller.I can't say anything bad about the music. The recording is very clear and clean and dynamic. The tunes generally have a pattern of chords and a melody of sorts, this theme being repeated with variations, sort of like jazz. Sort of. If these are improvisational variations, they strike me as a bit amateurish. However, they are harmonious and flow well with the music. I suspect that is part of the intended effect. There is meant to be nothing disturbing or jarring. Likewise there are very few phrases that stand out like a strong melody. In Carol of the Bells, with which most people are already familiar, the brain supplies the melody, which is almost buried at times in the variations and ornamentations.This is quiet, cool, flowing, melodic, gently propulsive piano playing. Forty minutes of it.Since I am the sort of person who often sits down and actively listens to music with full concentration, I didn't find a lot here for my mind to latch onto. Even the simplest of Beethoven's piano pieces are meatier than the fare on December. In this context, I'd give the album somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. Listenable, but unremarkable.However, as background music to set a certain mood, as an accompaniment to hanging tinsel on your Xmas tree, or washing dishes, dusting the knick knacks, or looking at coffee table photography books, George Winston's December might be just the ticket. Another reviewer called it sonic wallpaper, and it is pleasing wallpaper that will not jar or distract you from your meditations or the menial chores you may be performing while you've got the CD on. Maybe in this uninvolved, multi-tasking context this album should be five stars. A New Age classic.That's really the best advice I can give. It all depends on what you want music to do for you. This is the right tool for a certain job. For other purposes, it may be a blunt or useless instrument.

The energy of this series starts out strong and doesn't flag through the series ten episdoes. It's hard to compare to the first seasons, since hardly any of the cast is left. Is killing off or retiring characters due to burn-out becoming a crutch to create drama in the program? So far, it doesn't seem to have hurt.I think they've picked up the pace of action in season four. In many of the climaxes they are fighting a ticking clock down to the final seconds. Episodes from earlier seasons seem to develop at a bit more leisurely pace, which is more realistic, but less riveting.Whereas 24 has gone downhill over 6 seasons, MI-5 has improved. This may be the best espionage series on TV. If you liked previous seasons, there is no reason you shouldn't like season four.

Good King Bad shows several pre-echoes of Benson's big hit album Breezin', but without the vocals (except on the last track). Jazz purists may not be happy with the fact that it isn't as adventurous as some of Benson's other CTI-era albums. But didn't Ahmad Jamal prove that music doesn't have to be hard on the ears or played without restraint to be good jazz? All right, this is meant to appeal to a less sophisticated audience. Call me less sophisticated, then, because it appeals to me.I don't think there are any weak cuts. The sound of the band is familiar to those who know CTI releases. A solid in-house band, with Benson up front. File this with The Other Side Of Abbey Road -- two albums that deal in rhythms that can make you tap your toe and melodies you can hum. Commercial? Yeah. Also wonderful!

The producers of Homeland said they did not want to get viewers, they wanted to create addicts. Certainly the show is engaging. It does draw you in, and you want to return to find out what will happen to these characters. Mission accomplished, then.Homeland is more realistic than 24, more human, more deliberately paced for the most part. The writing and acting are top notch. The first season is a solid success, and I surely hope the show won't go off the rails in seasons to come.I'm taking one star off for the basic premises behind the main characters -- the Marine Brody and the CIA gal Carrie Mathison. Could someone actually rise to that level in the CIA while keeping secret her mental condition and the drugs she had to take daily to keep it under suppression? Could a Marine actually contemplate an act of terrorist revenge at the cost of tearing his own family apart? I won't reveal the answer, but the audience is being asked to contemplate the possibility. We are kept guessing, of course, but this is what we're asked to buy. For me, it's a bridge too far. I can imagine some Marines being quite offended at the show even floating the concept. In this respect, maybe Brody and Mathison are at their core as unreal as the indestructible Jack Bauer in 24.Apart from that problem with the premise, everything proceeds on an even keel, deliberately building the story, the conflict, and the suspense. The plot is very clever. It's escapist entertainment at the peak of the spy genre.Perhaps I also balk at the show's hints of a moral equivalence between our military actions and the actions of terrorists like the Abu Nazir character in Homeland. This is to be expected from the entertainment industry these days, but you don't have to be some sort of jingoist to notice it and be at least a little put off. It's just one more thing you might have to swallow and put out of your mind in order to enjoy the drama.

There isn't much to say about the CD -- if you have these songs already, you don't need to buy another copy. For the casual fans who want some of Elton's best, then this may be just the ticket.Others may be wondering about the Bonus DVD. From my perspective, having all of Elton's early CDs, and having seen him circa 1981 when he was probably at his absolute peak, the Vegas Red Piano show videos here are shocking. Elton's singing voice has changed so much he simply cannot sing the old songs anymore. I don't even like his phrasing. The piano playing is still good, and he does get the house bopping around on Saturday Night's Alright. His attempt at Your Song sounds like a parody of the stereotypical Vegas lounge singer trying to do a cover version, though. Tragic. For me, seeing these five songs from his Vegas act cures me of ever wanting to see Elton live again. Just enjoy the old records, and salute him for the good run that he's had.There are five other videos on the DVD -- an earlier live performance of Your Song, with full symphony orchestra behind him, is much better. The other four contain little of note. I found Robert Downey Jr. lip-syncing an entire song was a little disturbing and pointless. There are two Too Low For Zero-era videos probably made for MTV which are OK, but clearly dated.In short, the CD is great if that's what you need. The DVD really offers no incentive to own this new/old collection.

Norah Jones can still work magic with a song, breathing life into an old classic or a new tune. But you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and most of the tracks on Norah's latest were penned by Norah with bassist Lee Alexander, and related characters. Frankly, the quality suffers. What Norah needed here was another dose of Jesse Harris, whose special contributions to her debut CD not only yielded her hit Don't Know Why, but rounded out a nice selection of standards and songs of other artists. Norah's heavy reliance on herself and bandmates to supply the songs for this outing has severely handicapped it.Oh, the songs are pleasant enough, but just that. There are few gems. The country music duet with Dolly Parton is just embarrassing, I think. I always skip that one. I don't mind Norah singing country music. Her cover of Why Can't He Be You on the Patsy Cline tribute CD was a shining jewel, but that was a much better song.Probably there was a conscious effort to tone down the "jazz" aspects of her work. That's neither good or bad. However, Norah has an appealing piano style which is an essential complement to her singing, just like Mark Knopfler's guitar -- as if the voice and the instrument are playing a duet. She should use that and develop her improvisation. The production here is too stripped-down. The band as a whole should have more room to stretch its legs improvisationally.I do not understand the reason for choosing these mostly sedate, mostly average songs for the record. A bid for more publishing money by writing most of it with your boyfriend? I doubt it, but one wonders. I have no doubt that Norah and Lee can write some wonderful songs, but I doubt they can write enough of them to ever fill out an album, unless we wait for five or ten years between albums. Actually, Norah and Lee did write some great songs on the first album, but they wrote them alone, not in collaboration. Perhaps that is what works best. Given the number of great songs already written, and given that Norah is a natural prodigy in interpreting great material, she should move in that direction. The genre doesn't matter as much as the inherent quality of the material.All this advice is only a long way of saying I was let down. Also, the tactic of releasing a new version of the record with extra songs and a bonus DVD only a few months after the original release is very disappointing, especially to the millions of fans who already bought the stripped-down original. Just another grab for cash to compensate for the summer tour which sold fewer tickets than hoped for? I don't know. You be the judge. What I do know is that Norah Jones needs to crank up the volume and tempo a bit, and cherry-pick better songs to play.To the people who gave this five stars: You are too easily amused.

At the time of this writing, there is an option to buy this Deluxe Edition at the "club price" of $7.99. I happen to own the club edition, and I never bought the original CD, so I didn't end up buying most of the music twice.What you get over the non-Deluxe original release is three extra songs and a bonus DVD. The DVD is pleasant, with four performances from a Madrid concert and two music videos. Also included is a 17-minute Norah Jones interview. All of this is non-essential, in my opinion, although Norah's live version of the Gram Parsons song She is a great addition to her expanding repertoire of country-tinged material.On the audio CD, two of the three bonus cuts also have a country flavor. Moon Song is superior to those two. It is a sweet little tune that should have been on the original release, as a bookend to Sunrise. Why wasn't it?Oddly, the sound quality of the bonus cuts is more brilliant, dynamic, and immediate than the cuts from the orignal CD release. Puzzling. You may not notice, but careful listening will reveal that this is true.Norah's debut was not exactly jazz. But it was more jazz-influenced than Feels Like Home, which tilts toward the folk and country side of the musical spectrum. I cannot give this album five stars for that reason. Norah's talents are greater in the jazz-influenced arena, even though she has an obvious affection for other musical styles as well. I think she would do well to choose more cover songs, rather than originals written by herself and bandmates. They are good songwriters, but not great songwriters. Chances are you'll find yourself getting bored of these tunes quicker than the songs on Come Away With Me.At the right price, the Deluxe version of the album is the obvious choice. Three extra songs and six videos cannot justify the list price, though.

Style? The cell animation is great. The computer animation is great. But the two are in completely different styles -- a disturbing clash. As pointed out before, the characters are drawn in a style that went out-of-date at least 40 or 50 years ago. The story requires numerous amazing feats of animation and many different visually complex and arresting backgrounds and settings in the different levels of Metropolis. And there are tremendous chase scenes and the climactic destruction at the end. These are all impressive as an expression of the art and craft of animation. If you want to watch the movie simply to appreciate this craft, that is a legitimate reason to see it.However, the substance of the story did not interest this viewer. The premise does not make particular sense. Granted, Duke Red wants great power (not too sure why -- he doesn't seem particularly megalomaniacal otherwise), and perhaps has delusions of grandeur, thinking he will make the world a utopia under some kind of worldwide network of control. But I can't understand why he thought the way to accomplish this was to contruct a robot in the image of his deceased flesh-and-blood daughter.The boy Ken-ichi and the robot girl look admiringly at one another, and they have a bit of adventure together, but what is the attraction between these two? Their characters are less dimensional than the animation cells they were drawn on.For me the movie stands, or in this case falls, on the quality of the plot and the degree to which one can identify with the motives and emotions of the characters. For example, why does the anti-robot faction so vehemently hate the innocuous and cute robots in this fictional metropolis? They hate them because they hate them. The story has many elements which seem thrown together in a blender, sort of like the visual style. All to no particularly cohesive purpose.This is not great anime (like Miyazaki) nor is it particularly good cinema. Hats off to the animators. The writers and director earn no praise. Essentially boring and forgettable. Even the original Metropolis by Fritz Lang, a very dated silent film, is more involving than this.

Kagemusha is a great movie, and for my money it is more entertaining than Ran. Kurosawa was trying to be too artsy in the latter film, which always puts me off just a little. Kagemusha tells the story in a more straightforward fashion, the acting is less exaggerated, and I think it's just more fun. However, what prompted me to review it was the visual quality, which I found a bit below what I'd expect from Criterion.I saw the original shortened version in the theater when it was first released in USA. That was so long ago, memory won't allow me to compare with this Criterion DVD. However, the film, as noted by other reviewers, is a bit grainy. Nothing wrong with that. I like film grain, myself, as opposed to digitally smoothed visuals, which look less "organic" to me. The problem is that if you want to preserve accurately the whole visual character of the film, including the grain in the film, you need a lot of digital bits to do so. Kagemusha is three hours long. As a result, the average bitrate of the video on this DVD had to be shaved down somewhat. This leads to some "artifacts" of digital compression.It is a small point, perhaps. But the lower bitrate does make the movie look slightly more grainy than it already is, due to digital compression. Perhaps you won't care, or even notice unless you watch on a high definition monitor, however the movie is not quite as sharp and clean as it could be.My own preference would be for Criterion to have divided the movie in 2 parts on 2 DVDs, allowing the highest quality image possible. I don't think they quite achieved that goal with Kagemusha. Alternatively, Criterion could have applied more digital filtering to reduce the grain, and still put a three hour film on one disc.

I hate to be a party pooper, as the new Criterion Collection edition is the best and only in-print DVD edition of this classic film available. The movie is presented widescreen 16:9, but the aspect ratio is 1.66 to 1, which means little black bars on the right and left side of the widescreen image. It's the way the film ought to be presented.But... the original film appears to be incredibly grainy in the low-light restaurant shots -- i.e. 95% of the movie. Almost every shot is simply swimming with grain. I'm sure the Criterion edition faithfully reproduces this, but honestly I think a little digital processing to reduce the grain might have been more aesthetically pleasing. In some movies, perhaps film grain is part of the texture of the movie, and somehow adds to the artistic presentation. I can't see how this argument could be made for My Dinner With Andre.The special features on disc two are excellent. Anybody who has watched the movie over a dozen times, as I have, must have grown to love the characters in the film. Those characters are based on Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory, but only represent an aspect of their true selves. It is a joy to see each actor interviewed today for 30 minutes each, to hear them talk about their experiences in creating the film with Louis Malle, and how they look back on the film today. (Wallace said that he cannot stand to watch himself in the movie -- that Malle brought out things in him that he didn't know were there. Apparently that makes him uncomfortable.) The second feature on disc two is an hour-long documentary: Wallace Shawn interviews the director about his career and what he tried to achieve in his films. It is certainly an interesting character study, and perhaps reveals some of Malle's motivations in making several controversial films.As for the main feature, perhaps others can describe it better than I can. Andre Gregory, in the interview on disc 2, describes it as like Lawrence of Arabia in scope. The viewers are taken to Tibet, to the desert, to Poland, to many varied and strange scenes and happenings, but they are taken there through the power of words, not images. Each person sees a different version of these scenes, through an act of creation in the mind, responding to Andre's wild tales as he relates them to Wallace.It is also difficult to classify the discussion of society that occurs toward the end of the film. As the two men open up and express their fears and loves and annoyances, I find their worries about humanity, living in this dream world of comfort and endless distraction more relevant than when the film was first made. Perhaps it will become even more so in the future. For that reason alone, I think My Dinner With Andre's place as a cinema classic is secure.At the very least, the thoughtful student of society and cinema needs to see this film once, maybe twice, to grasp what these two artists are trying to say. For myself, I will enjoy the performances and the message for many years in repeated viewings.

For people who must have everything Stan Ridgway recorded, this is another item for their collections. I only want the good stuff. Apart from Beloved Movie Star, this is material that never goes anywhere. Reviewer Lon Jones was objective about this album -- it is a mish-mash of inconsequential and incomplete work. I won't discourage people from buying the CD, however, this should be the last Stan Ridgway album on your list to purchase. First get Partyball, Anatomy, Mosquitos, then The Big Heat, Black Diamond, and Snakebite. If you're still hungry for more, then Holiday in Dirt is just the ticket for you.

This band has a lot going for it on The Fast Rise And Fall Of The South. There is a good balance of acoustic and electric instruments. Good hooks, good rhythmic grooves. I like the lyrics, which tend to be a bit obscure and elliptical. Overall, this album tends to be fairly mellow and mid-tempo. Often I was reminded of the quieter material by the Kinks, say Muswell Hillbillies-style.Some of the tunes are put together very well. What I don't like is that some of the songs run on too long with repetition of specific grooves or lines. Standouts for me are the tracks And What Fallout, 10008, and Nova. Perhaps if the musicians were good at improvisation, they could have turned some of the longer songs into jams that would hold the listener's interest a bit better.Don't get me wrong. This is solid work. It is pleasant, comfortable listening. If they could edit things a little more tightly, kick the energy level up a bit, they might be quite awesome.

All the virtues of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy are present in the Smiley's People miniseries. I'm in awe of Alec Guinness. As a leading actor, this production was probably his swan song, but what a way to go out!Smiley seeks to unravel the mystery of one of his old commrades who turns up face down in the park, dead. He does this through a series of extensive interviews with friends and likely suspects, like a combination of James Bond and Sherlock Holmes. The end of this knowledge may enable Smiley to set a trap for his old nemesis, Karla.Guinness has perfected the art of naturalism in acting through minimalism. There is no distracting gesticulation and exaggerated emotion. Guinness brings Smiley into three dimensions simply by intelligence and quietness.This is a complicated story that unfolds over nearly six hours of programming. Patience and attention will be required to enable the viewer to enjoy and understand the plot progression. Movie fans who favor large explosions, kung fu fighting, and car chases down the wrong lane of a freeway ought to look elsewhere for entertainment. They will probably find the "talking heads" nature of this miniseries boring.Personally, I'd rate this in the top ten miniseries ever done for TV. It beats most academy award winning films of the past two decades.Technically, the image quality is superior to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. It is slightly sharper and slightly less grainy. There is a problem with the audio. On my set, the soundtrack to episodes 1 and 4 were somewhat muffled, leading to a bit more difficulty in deciphering the dialogue (especially given that many of the characters have accents -- Russian, French, etc.). I cannot explain why the other episodes sounded perfectly adequate, but 1 and 4 were muffled. Shoddy work in the mastering! Turn up the treble on your amplifier when listening to part 1 and 4.Apart from that glitch, this is a five star program. I rate it slightly higher than Tinker, Tailor, because I found the plot slightly easier to follow, probably due to better editing.

I give this thumbs down, because it's uninspiring in every way but one.As a technical achievement, Sky Captain is everything the producers hoped for, I'm sure. What was it exactly they were trying to achieve? Using computer animation, they've produced what looks like an old black-and-white vaseline-on-the-lens live-action Saturday afternoon popcorn flick made in the 1940s, subsequently given a bad colorization job by Ted Turner. Yes, the color, such as it is, is truly horrid. Old movies never looked like this -- so I really don't know why the visual designers made the color choices they did. Mainly, the film is black and white and gray and a kind of sickly washed-out orange. Bleah.The scale of production, with flying aircraft carriers, secret islands full of fantastic creatures, Shangri-La, gigantic retro-style space rockets, six-story robots marching down the streets of New York City wreaking havoc, is as large as one can imagine. And all this is generated in the computer. The actors were on a soundstage, surrounded by backgrounds and foregrounds covered in blue -- the blue parts being later removed by color separation and replaced with buildings, sky, military control centers, caves, or whatever the scene required. The integration between live and animated is virtually seemless -- probably the best that has ever been achieved.As a viewer, I found the story and characters two-dimensional, and frankly I was continually distracted by the visual style of the film. This two-dimensionality might have been better served, at much less expense, with conventional animation, perhaps in the art deco style of the Batman animated TV series and their subsequent straight-to-video motion pictures (Mask of the Phantasm, Batman and Mr. Freeze, The Batman-Superman Movie) -- I might have enjoyed that kind of film a bit more, if only through lowered expectations.The story itself is a blend of Buck Rogers and early 1950's sci-fi with a dash of James Bond. The dialogue is tolerable as a vehicle to move the story forward, but tries too hard to be clever. Or maybe, when you think about it, it doesn't try hard enouh. So much of the writing in old movies was rather poor -- today we only remember the good stuff, but most of it was pretty bad -- and I see no reason to emulate that cheesiness in a movie produced in 2004.I can't fault the actors for falling flat. Given the lines they had to read, and the fact they had no visual cues from their surroundings to work with, their failure is excusable. Any movie that ends with the line, "Lens cap," obviously has serious problems with the script.The average Adam Sandler movie will move me more than this film did, and that ain't sayin' much. Like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury (in this case beautifully animated sound and fury), signifying nothing, this film is a failure, but a spectacular failure. But yeah, they did save the world, and Sky Captain gets the girl. But you already knew that's how it would end.

Every voter should read this book, because everyone should know who it is they are voting for or against. What defines this candidate? Not merely a set of position papers. In my case, I am voting against Senator Obama. That does not make his book any less valuable and compelling. Now more than ever I know why I am making another choice.Some of Obama's musings in between the strictly narrative sections can be a bit ponderous. The scenes of his life, as described in this book, are full of detail, highly readable, novel-like. As such, they strike me as having been embellished, because only a man with photographic memory could accurately remember conversations and thoughts and feelings in such detail. However, I'll give Obama the benefit of the doubt that these scenes are truthfully described according to his overall memory. And frankly, I doubt the book would be as readable if such fine details were not included, whether they are strictly accurate to the letter or not.I see a parallel between Obama's life history and his political philosophy. Obama longed to know his absent father. Obama looks to government as more than "Uncle Sam." Government is to be Daddy to us all. Progressives may sympathize with this view, and libertarians/conservatives will recoil from it. Nevertheless, Obama's early "community organizer" days are well-covered in this book, and from the start Obama looked upon government as a solution to nearly every problem (housing, schooling, jobs, health, etc.). It is unclear to me what evidence leads Obama to believe this can ever truly lift poor minorities out of their miseries, when it seems so clear that character and lifestyle choices can undermine any gifts or advantages the government may bestow on poor communities. And that without families -- read intact families with present, functional fathers -- most poor children will never reach their full potential, unlike Mr. Obama.Also, it is clear from the description of Barack's first service in Jeremiah Wright's church in chapter 14 that Barack was fully aware of the reverend's "blame the white man" tendencies from the start. Those tendencies may not have been addressed then in the offensive manner that ultimately got so much media attention, but the die was plainly cast. Did Wright really bring Obama literally to tears with that first sermon? I believe he may have, as described in the book.There's no way any of us can really walk in Obama's shoes, but this book is the next best thing. Barack describes an inside view of what it was like to grow up black in American society, yet also feeling an outsider because of his multinational, multiracial origins and upbringing. It is good for all of us, of all political persuasions, to understand those kinds of struggles, and to honor Senator Obama for all he has overcome, and for his intentions to try to change things for the better.How the reader ultimately views Obama's methods for achieving such change will depend a lot on the philosophical premises he or she brings to the reading. Still, this book is an effective tool for understanding the origin of candidate Obama's personal ambitions and his politics, whether you like them or not. Further, it serves as a sore reminder of the mental and emotional plague that is inflicted on children when their fathers are distant or completely missing in action. If only all men could understand that before they become fathers!Barack Obama is a rich man now. For writing this book, he deserves to be. There are lessons for all of us here.

I'm not a big fan of Extended Play (EP) albums. You usually tend to pay almost as much as for a full album, with fewer songs. But unless every song is a winner, you can feel a little cheated.There are probably 5 or 6 very good songs on Shine. Then there are some spooky, lazy, moody instrumentals that would probably be more appropriately placed on Lanois' Belladonna instrumental album (which honestly I thought was a bust). A few of the songs are merely OK, and they sound underproduced, slightly unfinished.Highlights for me were the quiet Sometimes, Shine, and San Juan. Also worthwhile are the first three songs. As I implied, this set would make a good EP.The sound is what you'd expect from Lanois. It has a character similar to the quieter material on Dylan's Oh Mercy CD, which Lanois produced, without so much echo and distance. Lanois has a formula -- he has certain sonic preferences, and he doesn't change or mess with them much from record to record -- certainly not on his own record.There's nothing really bad here, only varying degrees of good. If you're not too demanding, this can be a pleasant listen, a nice way to unwind when that is the type of music you need. Still, I am not that happy with this set as a whole. I can only express enthusiasm for the individual songs I specified. Clearly, Lanois main talent is producing.

This record is an interesting historical document of a Brazilian artist digesting many of the influences of pop music in the late 1960s and applying it to his art. In other words, it is both derivative and original at the same time.It is melodic, the arrangements are nice. The styles represented are rather ecclectic.I can't make any judgments on the lyrical content since it is sung in Portugese and there is no translation of the extensive lyrics on the enclosed lyric sheet. The music alone is not enough to hold my interest on repeated listening, and with no lyrics, the album is of limited value to me.By the way, the album is monophonic, and it sounds like many pop music efforts of its time -- attempting to squeeze vocals and multimiked orchestral arrangements and guitars/drums all into one center channel. The sound is dated: compressed, and a little tinny.I'm sure that at the time this sounded groundbreaking to some people. Listening in a modern setting, apart from the fact that it is melodic, whereas other pop music at the time of its releast was getting increasingly agressive, it is good music but not great.

This is the first NIN album I have heard, so I cannot put it in context with what has come before from this artist. Other newcomers to NIN will want to listen to this before purchase, advisable for almost every new album, but especially here. My musical and lyrical context is great pop music (XTC, Beatles) and progressive rock like Canada's power trio Rush -- that is the standard I am using for comparison.The music is mechanical and fairly monotonous with beats, bleeps, bloops, other electro-mechanical sounds, distorted guitars, distorted voices. A few of the songs have interesting melodies, Great Destroyer for example, though this is marred by a descent into mostly rhythmic noise.If this is an attempt at some artistic statement against the politics and religion of America, I would judge it rather pedestrian. As a Christian, I thought I might be offended, but Reznor never draws much blood as far as I'm concerned. He doesn't really compete with the visceral attack of an Andy Partridge ("Dear God... Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? Did you make mankind after we made you? And the devil too!"), or the straightforward anti-religion of Neil Peart's Fear (Witch Hunt being the most famous of the four parts of that work).As a new listener, I have very little feeling about this. It isn't particularly good, it isn't particularly poor. Musically it is a little monotonous, but it isn't unlistenable. Lyrically it seems pale, and Reznor's delivery is often rather low-key spoken or whispered. If this moves anyone, I'm at a loss to know why. If Reznor worries about a religious [...] world empire, he should probably focus his attention more keenly on Islamism. In an Islamist state, he might not be able to make or hear music of any sort, or express any disquiet or dissent about the leadership. No alcohol, no free love either. Is it Trent's purpose to cast doubt on the only world empire ready to defend him from real fascism so that he can be free to whine about oppression? I'd say from Reznor's or anybody's point of view, that's a bad strategy.

Toni Collette and Shirley Maclaine are great actresses. Cameron Diaz is believable here, but how hard is it to play a ditzy blonde, anyway? (For a great Cameron Diaz performance, see Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her.) So, the performers are up to the task. The script does not overdo it -- it doesn't veer off into unbelievability anywhere.The only thing to complain about is the pace, the overall low energy level that continues on throughout the movie. Even the scenes that should be dramatic, like the older sister walking in on her boyfriend cheating on her with her younger sister, seem to have less impact and excitement than they ought.I'm not one who minds movies with little action -- one of my favorites is My Dinner With Andre, consisting of two people having a two-hour dinner conversation. In Her Shoes just drags. Not horribly, but it drags.If you have the patience, this is a pleasant movie. But I think it could have been so much better if it had been shortened by 25%.

I have nothing against live albums. Sometimes an artist's best work is in live performance. Paul McCartney made two very good live albums, Wings Over America and Tripping The Live Fantastic. I own both of those, but I can't find a reason to purchase Paul Is Live. Why?First, while this is a very professional, workmanlike, more-than-acceptable performance, I can't quite shake off the feeling -- listening to the offhand way Paul sings some of these -- that Paul put little inspiration or passion in performing this set. Perspiration, yes. Passion, no. It's a job to be done, and he does it. The crowd goes wild. Mission accomplished.But still, I can't think of a single track here that I wouldn't rather hear from the original studio CD recording. In fact, now that I've heard Paul Is Live once, I feel no urge to ever hear it again. That's not true of Paul's other two live albums that I named. Wings Over America, for example, begins with Venus and Mars/Rock Show/Jet that blazes with raw intensity not found on the original albums. I can't say they are better performances compared to the original studio versions, but equally enjoyable.Second, the sound mix on Paul Is Live is not as appealing as it could be. The presentation is more like what you would hear from a good seat near the mixing board at an outdoor concert. In that sense, it might be a more realistic presentation of what a live concert actually sounds like. Usually, I like live recordings that are mixed with a perspective that's a little less distant.My advice, based on the many McCartney albums I own and enjoy, is to pass on this one. At least hear it first to make sure it is worth it to you. I give three stars because there is nothing bad here. But nothing inspiring either.

If you've heard Jamal's early work and are expecting something in that vein, you are bound to be most disappointed with After Fajr. I found this music difficult and unfulfilling.In the 1950's and early 60's, Jamal was a jazz phenomenon. The main virtue of his work in those days was taking a popular song (or even one of his fine originals) and interpreting it in a simple, melodic, and powerful way. It was user-friendly to the non-jazz audience, and impressive to the mainstream jazz lover as well. There are two collections that represent an excellent sampling of this work: Cross Country Tour and Ahmad's Blues. This is the peak of classic Ahmad Jamal artistry.The melodies on After Fajr can be extremely difficult. One song has a vocal part that even a classically trained vocalist would have difficulty executing in a confident fashion. Jamal's piano playing has become increasingly "flighty" for lack of a better word. He flits across the keyboard from one mood and one style to the next with no seque or warning. It is the performance equivalent of attention deficit syndrome.If you want the easy listening cocktail-music style of Ahmad Jamal that made him famous, avoid this latest CD. I'm sure that some listeners will have an academic interest in this new release. It doesn't swing. It doesn't soar. It does not move me at all, except to the CD player, to take it out of the machine and put on something more tuneful.

I won't say much about the content, as others have covered that subject well. She gets help here from Ruth and Charles Brown, Bruce Hornsby, and Jackson Browne. The band is completely tuned into these songs -- everything is right on cue, sympathetic to Bonnie's vocals and solos. Slammin'!!True, Bonnie doesn't sing classic blues on this album. She filters it through the rock and pop genre. So what? Anyone who can't hear the blues in her slide guitar is just constipated.I own both the CD and the video version on laserdisc. The CD set is very reasonably priced if you buy it used, but you might do well to consider buying the DVD to get all the visual excitement too.I've seen Bonnie live once. She is a professional. She is a natural live performer. Arguably these live takes are better than the album versions. I think she thrives on an audience. If you like Bonnie Raitt, above all don't miss *this* album. It may be her best, in addition to being one of the best live albums I've ever seen/heard on film.

I'm not sure Earl Klugh ever topped Finger Paintings. Every track is a gem, from the funky "Keep Your Eye On The Sparrow" to the mellowest lyrical numbers. Some may say this is overproduced. I think it is gorgeous. Superficially this may resemble MUZAK in spots, with the strings and woodwinds, but Klugh communicates his heart through his playing. I don't play this disc often any more, but I haven't tired of it yet. It stands the test of time.For the most part, the melodies are simply beautiful. Yes, the improvisation is virtuoso and harmonious, too. I have nothing but good feelings about this disc.Dave Grusin is a "commerical" artist. I guess that means he writes music that appeals to a large audience. I can't find anything wrong with that, as long as it isn't at the expense of your soul. Grusin infuses his projects with an underlying gravitas, and this is no exception. The two Klugh albums preceding this release (the self-titled "Earl Klugh" and "Lining Inside Your Love") are also fine choices, but Finger Paintings tops them both.We need more albums like Finger Paintings. The world is challenging enough. A lot of the music made today does not soothe the savage breast like it should. Earl Klugh's jazz relaxes and soothes, without triteness. *cough* Kenny G *cough*

This is pretty much a bare bones DVD featuring extended London concert footage. I have no beef with the camera work. It is simple, but effective, and much preferable to so many concert videos where the camera moves so much and cuts from one angle to the next occur so quickly it threatens to give one vertigo, or at least a headache.The choice of 4:3 aspect ratio, in an era where even run-of-the-mill TV shows are widescreen, is inexplicable. The video quality is good, but not great. [A customer has reported that some sets offer a 16:9 version. That is good news, but be sure what you're getting before you buy. Mine is only 4:3. With a widescreen disc, I would bump up the rating to 4 1/2 stars.]The audio could have been better. Happily, an uncompressed LCPM stereo track is available (the default) on the DVD, which should make for maximum sound quality. But the disc producers chose to muck this up, too. The sound is dynamically compressed, i.e. the soft parts are made loud so the dynamic contrast between soft and loud is blunted. When the band gets going full blast, the sound is congested -- it loses some clarity. Nevertheless, I would rate the sound as good, not great -- equivalent in sound quality to a musical segment on the Letterman show or Tonight Show on digital TV.The concert is great, and Leonard is full of warmth and grit, whatever is called for. Leonard Cohen appears to be having the time of his life, and the band is perfect. His angelic choir, a trio of female backup singers, is magnificent. The guitarist provides Knopfler-esque lead lines, and his "wind instrument" and keyboard players add richness to the mix.This is the perfect introduction to Leonard Cohen. It represents his best compositions (though I am disappointed that Joan of Arc is not part of the set list). At age 74 Cohen's voice is a bit husky, but these performances are as good as any I've ever heard on his studio albums or live material. (Granted, I do not have a large collection of Cohen albums, however I appreciate very much his songs, including those performed by other artists.) It's hard to imagine him ever topping this.If you are unfamiliar with Leonard Cohen's music, it is generally quite simple, with common chord progressions and easy melodies. You might quickly find yourself singing along with these tunes. Cohen's strengths are his poetry and his delivery of the poetic line. He has always loved embellishing the simplicity of the songs with female choruses and fuller arrangements, while the structure retains the essence of folk music. Sometimes he favors a Spanish rhythm.For me, this is the definitive Leonard Cohen live performance, much as Joni Mitchell's Shadows and Light concert DVD highlights her best songs and best performances a with dream team band. That DVD is also deficient technically, but the music shines through. So it is here. It's a five star concert with one star deducted for technical quality that does not measure up to the artistry of the performance.

I've heard an earlier CD edition of this album, and the way it was mixed or mastered really ruined it for me. The instruments seemed to be compressed and mixed together in such a way that they were competing against one another in a very unpleasant way. I just couldn't hack it, honestly. (Like the new Rush album, Clockwork Angels, I think the music had merit, but the mixing/mastering of it made it nearly impossible for me to enjoy.)The 40th Anniverary edition of Sunflower sounds like a vast improvement, at least on the first four tracks. The various instruments sound much more pure and distinct. I really enjoy the music now. (Unfortunately, the copy I ordered was damaged, and I had to return it. This was the fault of the vendor, not amazon -- who only handled order fulfillment. I will be looking for a replacement when I see it available at the right price.)The last track sounds like it was derived from the previous master, and is not nearly as pleasant. It sounds dynamically compressed.The stable of players here is the typical CTI bunch, all top notch players. This is not difficult, outre jazz. It amounts mostly to jamming on simple chord progressions, but it's very good jamming by very tasteful and talented players. Really a delight.

I'm in much agreement with David Pearlman's spotlight review. The bonus disc is non-essential. The demo cuts only prove that Jackson had a clear vision of what he wanted this album to sound like before he started officially recording it. That makes me respect his talent more, but there's no way I prefer the demos to the main album.Likewise, I found the Mike's Murder tracks to be lesser songs than the nine gems on the original Night and Day album. And the live cuts... I guess you had to be there. Once again, I would prefer the studio versions of these songs.On the other hand, the remastered cuts from disc one -- the classic original Night and Day album -- sound as good as or even better than my original vinyl. The dynamics have not been squashed (but keep in mind that the original album did not have tremendously wide dynamic range), which is always a fear these days with remastered CDs. The clarity is excellent.The songs? They probably represent the best set of tunes Joe Jackson ever put on disc. This is an album you listen through all the way, not feeling the urge to skip tracks. It is pop music that hasn't been dumbed down. Jackson is a bit weak vocally on the songs that require a real crooner. Perhaps Sinatra would not have been the right fit for this material, but someone of his caliber could take the music to new heights. Still, Joe does his best, and he gets the point across. The arrangements are exciting, rhythmic, complex.This package isn't the best value. Obviously on some of these deluxe editions, the record company is trying to squeeze some extra bucks out of the customer. As a practical matter, that is their right, though I deplore it as much as the next buyer. If you love the album and can find it for a reasonable price, I would say do not hesitate. You'll probably listen to the bonus disc once and then ignore it. If you value sound quality, you'll probably appreciate the fine remastering job on disc one. If you're not one to fuss about sound, you're probably better off buying the single-disc release.

I've listened to Abbey Road dozens of times. Tonight as I listened to the CD, I was motivated to write about the sound quality. It sounds like a poor transfer. I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl, and though it has been a long time since I listened to it, it is much more tolerable than the CD. Why? The CD sound is a plastic imitation. Ringo's cymbals sound like white noise. The drums are all stick and no skin. Bass is flabby and indistinct (granted, even on the Mobile Fidelity release it is not anything to praise, but the CD is worse). The organ on Harrison's "Something" sounds more like a Casio keyboard than a Hammond. There's a smudging of everything and very little sense of open space around any of the vocals or instruments. I could go on and on, but if anyone can get a superior analog version of this album, they can make their own comparison. I think in almost every category, any trained listener would find the CD sound worse.Yet, I have trepidations about the inevitable remastered versions of the Beatles catalog that are rumored to be just around the corner. When they remade the Let It Be album (Let It Be Naked), the sound had more clarity, but it also seemed dynamically compressed. I could live with it, if they did that to the other albums, but I would not be completely satisfied.Most people will think I am just nitpicking. But good music deserves a decent transfer from the master tape. Comparing the CD with the vinyl, this didn't happen when Abbey Road was transfered to digital. I find the CD convenient, but it is always a strangely unsatisfying experience. The CD gives an impression of this great album, but the unnatural timbres of instruments and electronic quality of the voices deaden the beauty of the songs.If you buy this, just remember that there is more to this album than you will ever hear from the CD. We hope for better... maybe the remastered version. But I may just digitally record my vinyl copy. It may well outdo any future remastering.UPDATED MARCH 2011: The 2009 remaster of Abbey Road is not perfect, but in bass quantity and quality, in smoothness, overall clarity, and organic wholeness of the sound -- it beats the earlier release handily. The 2009 CD remaster even beats vinyl versions I've heard. There are new vinyl releases of this album coming, which may best the CD, but that is just an audiophile hope at this point. In my opinion, the original CD release has little to recommend it. I'll never listen to it again. Go for the remaster.

Moving Pictures is a classic album of great songs, performed with unmatched innovation and artistry by the classic power trio Rush. I've loved the album for over a quarter century. This review will concentrate on the sound of the new remastered version -- the release now being sold by Mercury records.I read on the Steve Hoffman forum last week about fans' differing opinions of the original mastering of the Moving Pictures CD, "The Rush Remasters" series, and the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Gold CD (out of print). Not having the Mobile Fidelity, I can't comment on that. But the discussion prompted me to obtain a copy of the original CD from a friend, to compare to my Rush Remasters edition, which is the current release available on Mercury.The original master was a bit dark, with less midrange than remaster, the cymbals and hi-hat sounded just a bit "tizzy" -- a bit more electronic and less organic. The original is less clear, and Geddy Lee sounds as if he's a little farther away. The remaster is cleaner and clearer. It is easier to distinguish the individual instrument lines. And Geddy sounds like he's closer to the mike, a little louder.What I find a bit disturbing is that the remaster, while being cleaner, is also a bit less dynamic. The drum beats don't have the same impact. This is noticed more on some songs than others. It was very evident on Tom Sawyer. Not as much on Red Barchetta. And so on.I have respected Robert Ludwig's mastering work a great deal. I have many vinyl albums he cut the LP masters for. I have a Canadian pressing of Moving Pictures Bob Ludwig mastered that I've played countless times. It has as much or possibly more dynamic punch than the original CD. Now I'm losing my faith in Ludwig. Perhaps he bowed to what the band required when making The Rush Remasters. I think the apparent dynamic compression subtly but significantly diminishes the artistry of the music.If you are buying this album on CD, you have a choice between the dynamic but slightly veiled sound of the original release (you'll have to buy it used, but they are quite inexpensive), or the current clearer remastered CD, which blunts the dynamic force of Geddy's bass and Neal Peart's drums. The Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab Gold CD version has the dynamic strengths of the original release and the clarity of the remaster -- so really it is the best of both worlds, but that is a pricey out of print collector's item.This makes me a bit sad. Maybe it also explains why after I bought the Rush Remaster edition of Moving Pictures, I didn't play the as much anymore. On the plus side, the dynamic compression of the remastered CD will sound better in noisy environments like an automobile, or listening on an iPod on the bus. The quieter musical subtleties won't be as buried by road noise.The remaster represents progress of a sort, but a qualified kind of progress. And in some ways, it's a step back, because the dynamics of the original master tape, as judged by the original vinyl LP, were not fully preserved.

Customers searching the reviews here should take seriously the descriptions of other reviewers: "slammin'," "one-chord jamming," "blow out," etc. The musicians are great. I like all of them in other contexts. The two main numbers on Straight Life are relatively long jams -- a little bit of theme and then Hubbard's horn, Benson's guitar, Herbie's electric piano, and sax take their extended turns riffing. Nothing wrong with that. While the solos had a lot of energy, they didn't seem particularly inspired or innovative, personally. I can appreciate an energetic blow out, within reason: Michael Brecker's screeching sax on Dry Cleaner From Des Moines (on Joni Mitchell's Shadows and Light live set) is absolutely classic and I would say inspired. But mostly, I like some melody with my jazz energy. Maynard Ferguson's more accessible work, for instance.If these are your sensibilities, too, then you might find this album a little tedious, except for the lyrical final cut, where Hubbard solos and George Benson quietly accompanies on the beautiful and relaxed Here's That Rainy Day.The recording -- strictly with respect to sound quality -- is typical CTI. Close-miked instruments, not a lot of ambience from the recording venue. It sounds like a Rudy Van Gelder deal to me. No complaints really on that count.I haven't heard a great deal of Freddie Hubbard's music. Actually, he's a recent discovery for me. I can say that I didn't like this album as much as some of his others. That's too bad. He had such a group of great band-mates here.

I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. I can't say I actually remember the cinematography specifically. Certainly the VHS release was never much to brag about -- grainy and awful, really.I had higher hopes for this DVD. Although it won't matter to many, my copy, purchased last year, claims on the back of the box to have two versions of the film -- anamorphic 2.35:1, and full screen. There is no full screen. False advertising, not that many will care, but the discrepancy is strange.The video quality is mediocre on an absolute basis, and compared to contemporary DVD releases it is poor. Watching it, I keep having the sense that several gradations of color intensity have been smudged over -- what's dark is dark, what's light is light, and in-between I have the sense that a lot of detail is being lost. Mostly the picture looks a bit indistinct. The color is fine as far as it goes -- a little on the washed out side, if you ask me.Yes, another viewer noted that the sound quality is uninspiring. Plain old stereo, possibly from an optical track, as far as I can tell. Pretty shabby, considering the caliber of the stars involved and the technical standards DVD buyers come to expect these days.If you haven't seen Year of Living Dangerously, I agree with those who have praised the quality of the film, and you should rent it or borrow it. Any movie that quotes the gospel of Luke and Tolstoy in the first five minutes is obviously a cut above the average entertainment film. Linda Hunt! What can I say! You believe, absolutely, that she is the diminutive male photographer, Billy Kwan. Linda is the narrator, and more of a star of this movie than Mel Gibson, though Gibson is not shabby at all in his performance either.I hesitate to recommend a purchase. This beautiful film badly needs a proper remastering. My counsel is to wait for that before laying down your money on the barrelhead.

I wish I could be more enthusiastic about James Taylor's debut with Apple records. No doubt the two best songs here are Carolina In My Mind (overproduced here) and Something In The Way She Moves (this version is rushed). The best songs, yes, but these are not the best performances of those songs.James re-recorded them both for his greatest hits album, and he leaves these earlier versions in the dust. And of course there are various live versions which outclass these studio efforts.The little chamber music interludes between songs seem to add an air of preciousness or pretentiousness to the project as well. There is quite a lot of variety in the songs here. The blues number is entertaining. Still, the difference between this album and the album he made two years later for Warner Brothers is a quantum leap forward.I loved James Taylor from his first Warner Brothers LP onward, and bought them all. I'm not sure I can name any artist who has put out such consistently high quality work over such a long span of time, with the possible exception of Paul Simon. This album is a document of an artist in his developing stages, who was I think a bit overwhelmed by his producer and the production. It is an interesting document of 1968. I am listening to the album as I write this, and I am amused by it. However, I can't see it having any replay value for me. I gladly go back to J.T. or even James' Mudslide Slim album again and again. This album? Not so much.I wouldn't discourage a fan from buying this CD, but don't expect to find much of a calibre equal to his future efforts. It presents James' music in a gestational phase, but not fully hatched.

I feel other reviewers have been a little too kind to this product. My friend taped this series when it was first shown on HBO. I watched his tapes and enjoyed it very much. It aims at greatness and almost hits the target. Hanks probably told this story as well as it could be done while still maintaining historical accuracy. When I saw this on DVD at Blockbuster, I had to rent it for a second look. For me, it does not hold my interest as well the second time around.Additionally, I was slightly disappointed with the DVD picture quality. I had just seen the Sex and the City first season DVD set, where the picture quality was great. The DVD of From the Earth to the Moon is definitely a step down from there. The colors seem a bit desaturated (except in special FX scenes), everything slightly defocussed, and there are often &quot;moire&quot; patterns (I think this is what they are called) in areas of the picture where there are black and white lines close to one another. The special effects scenes seem to be sharper and better looking than the normal photography. I'm not sure why. HBO should remaster this as pennance for not lavishing the care on mastering this material that it deserves. And let people trade in the first edition for the properly mastered one.The package is very good. But I can't possibly give it 5 stars -- that would put it in a category with works of art like Lawrence of Arabia, or Vertigo. No, it is not THAT good -- let's be realistic.And the less than stellar (no pun intended) quality of the video must take away another star. So this is how I arrived at three stars. If I was allowed, I'd give it three and a half stars. If we are to have any perspective about this video in comparison to the entire universe (again, no pun intended) of great DVDs of great films, this is a completely fair rating.

Babylon 5 had four 4-star seasons, but the fourth season concluded a bit abruptly. Much was compressed into the final episodes to finish the main story arc, just in case the series wasn't renewed for the planned fifth year. That was sub-optimal, but the writers pulled it off. When the series was resurrected on cable for the last year, there was a bit of a vacuum in terms of a story to tell.The logical progression would have been to concentrate on the looming war between humans and telepaths (a war telegraphed in season four when ex-Security Chief Garibaldi was mind-screwed by telepath Bester, and planted in the top levels of a mega-corporation secretly developing a biological weapon specifically designed to kill telepaths). The fifth season was a perfect opportunity for this war to finally come to fruition, though admittedly it might have been difficult to tell this story from Babylon 5, being as the action probably would have occurred mostly on earth. Nevertheless, I feel this would have been a better option than the modest plot developments season five was wasted on.In the first eight episodes or so, instead of a war between telepaths and normal humans, we got a conflict between Psi-Corps telepaths and non-Psi-Corps telepaths, occurring on Babylon 5 itself. Then Garibaldi finds he has been blocked from taking his revenge on Bester, and falls back into the whiskey bottle again. The other major plot theme in season five is the mysterious attacks on Alliance vessels, attacks which are eventually discovered to be coming from Centauri ships. Yet we learn more as time progresses -- not all is as it seems. The Centauri are falling victim to covert influences, and Londo himself eventually succumbs. A new captain of Babylon 5 is brought in by Sheridan, so that Sheridan can devote his time to the alliance. The new captain is given little of substance to do, however.All these plot arcs and sub-plots are quite an anticlimax compared to the galaxy-changing conflicts in season four. The writing suffers and even the actors are perhaps not up to their usual standards because of it. The special effects are better than ever, but this is a minor triumph, as it is in the service of substandard Babylon 5 stories. All dressed up and nowhere to go is the motto of Babylon 5 season five.Many have praised the final episode, Remain in Light, as if it justifies the mediocrity of the rest of the fifth season. Honestly, I found the series finale in the same mode. It was slow, and positively dreary. Yes, I felt a lump in my throat at the end, too. If you have followed Sheridan through the previous four seasons, how could you not be moved when his number finally comes up? Still, it all plays a bit like a wake for a man who isn't quite dead yet.Also, I don't think I will spoil anything by saying that as John Sheridan passes from this life to "beyond the rim," his beloved Babylon 5 is being demolished because it is a "menace to interstellar navigation." Huh? How is a Babylon 5 turned into tiny pieces of space junk orbiting the planet LESS of a menace to navigation?! It's just stupid. They should have crashed the station, as a whole, into the planet, to remove the obstacle. That kind of inattention to detail is emblematic of the problems of season five.Fans will want to see these shows. They certainly aren't BAD. I cannot believe they will have the same replay value for me as the first 88 episodes from seasons 1-4. I rate those seasons four stars, because they had their imperfections (there is a lot of "grade inflation" in the ratings at amazon.com). Yet, they represent perhaps the most consistent and endearing episodic science fiction TV ever made. In season five, the show was coasting on its laurels. Lateral drift. Three stars.

There are two DVD versions of LoA. The Limited Edition contains extra documentaries and "making of" features. However, the Superbit Collection release (now out of print, but readily available) offers no extras but higher picture quality.I have owned both versions. The extra features on the limited edition are nice, but you'll probably only watch them once. The film is the thing, and the Superbit edition really does offer an improved picture quality. If you are watching DVDs on a small TV, it won't make a real difference. If you are watching on a high definition computer monitor or projection TV, I would recommend the Superbit version. If you want to see the documentary features of the Limited Edition, rent it from Blockbuster or Netflix.It appears that all the reviews for LoA are being placed in the listings of both the Limited Edition and the Superbit Collection. I am adding this info so that hopefully people can choose wisely in their purchase. Even the Superbit version has some flaws in mastering, but it is cleaner and clearer, so bear this in mind.As for the artistic and entertainment quality of the film itself, suffice it to say that I believe it is in a tie with the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the best movie ever made. But whereas the Lord of the Rings had to rely on digital trickery for its vast battle scenes, Lawrence shows real people, hundreds if not thousands, in a story that is both a sweeping epic and a personal journey. (Much like Lord of the Rings.)Whichever version you buy, buy and study this wonderful film -- more relevant than ever now, with our intense involvement in the Middle East.

As noted, this product is the 4:3 aspect ratio (full screen) edition.If you have a home theater with a wide screen display, you may prefer the 16x9 "Deluxe Widescreen Edition" that appears elsewhere on amazon.com (no panning, scanning, or letterboxing).Full Metal Jacket (Deluxe Widescreen Edition)This is only available new or used from amazon marketplace sellers, but it is readily available. This version will fill the screen of your widescreen television. It is the theatrical aspect ratio.Your money, your choice. Yes, Kubrick did approve the full screen version for home video, but that was in the days of standard definition television, VHS video, etc. We have better options now. Again, your choice.

I would likely give this album a higher rating, but Charlie Byrd usually plays a more full-bodied classical guitar. On many of the cuts on Blur Byrd, it sounds as if he is playing one of those very thin-body guitars meant exclusively for amplified performance. And, to my ears, it sounds too much like rubber bands twanging against a plastic box. Of course, this is hyperbole, but the timbre of the instrument is just plastic-y and unpleasant. Your mileage may vary. Frankly it ruins the listening experience for me on quite a few cuts on Blue Byrd. I'm far from an expert on the Byrd discography, but I don't recall hearing Charlie play this instrument on any other album.Word to the wise, and heads up. Hopefully it won't bother you as it did me.

I bought the 12" laserdisc release of this movie some years ago, and the colors are vivid, the edges are sharp, and I could find little to complain about except they messed up the subtitles in several spots -- they were actually missing in certain scenes.But laserdisc is a dead format. Now comes the DVD, and they've ruined the movie. The colors are washed out. Edge enhancement is very prominent and annoying. If you are watching on a progressive monitor -- the deinterlacing is bad. The picture looks fuzzy, in spite of the edge enhancement.I thought the Return of Sherlock Holmes DVD transfers were bad, but this is worse. Shame, shame on all who had a hand in releasing this DVD edition.EDITED as of 11/09/2007: There is a new version, a new transfer of this movie, in a combination HD-DVD and standard DVD package. I believe there is a Blu-Ray version too, also containing a standard DVD in the package. They have fixed the video problems I complained about in the original DVD release. I'm glad they finally got the mastering right. It's a beautiful rendering of a beautiful film. Overpriced, though.

Why haven't people given this film more credit? Because it moves at a leisurely pace, and there are no great chase scenes with crashes and explosions? No fight scenes with wire-fu and impossible gymnastics?If some of the themes of The Majestic are cliched, it doesn't matter when the actors are so good at conveying their characters, and eliciting genuine emotion in the audience. But I guess it is just too much to expect a modern audience, raised on "reality TV" (which is about as fake as you can get), to appreciate subtlety and hometown values. Harumph!This film deserves at least four stars, maybe a bit more, in view of the truckload of gutless artifice that passes for art in Hollywood these days.

This stuff is like an endurance test. How many times can *you* listen to the same theme repeated over and over and over, without screaming, &quot;Change the chords, for crying out loud! Vary the tempo. Add a new melody. Anything!&quot;This is not music, as such. There are snippets of songs here which build up a tension through repetition that is never released. Then the track ends. Musicalis interruptus. Except that they could not completely ruin Violane. They tried, though.I cannot believe this material is from the same period as Cocteau Twins' Milk and Kisses album. The weakest song on that record is ten times better than anything here. Beware that this material is not representative of the other songs Cocteau Twins were releasing at the time.

Kim Possible is not a consistent show, but it had its moments. This movie makes a fine finale for the show. I think of Kim as a kind of teenage Sydney Bristow, without Sloane as her evil overlord. Maybe an alternate title could have been "Alias 90210."The two plots in So The Drama involve Kim looking for a romantic partner for the school dance, and Drakken's plot to distribute toys to children throughout the country via the Bueno Nacho restaurants --then sending a signal that turns these toys into evil robots bent on world domination. Pretty standard Saturday morning cartoon fare. Well done, though, with reasonably intelligent dialogue and good pacing.Kim solves both her romance problems and her evil robot problems in the next-to-last scene, where she opens a can of wire-fu style butt whipping on Drakken and Shego, finally putting them in the clink for good (we hope). The voice actress for Kim Possible also sings the final song, as Kim and Ron attend the school dance together. While I'm not a great fan of bubblegum pop, I find this song a lot more appealing that the stuff being scooped out by Ashlee Simpson and her ilk.There is another Kim Possible episode on this disc, a normal-length show about a giant samurai ape that is just about the dumbest KP show I've ever seen. Really, this adds no value to the package. There are also two music videos of songs that appear in the film.So The Drama is a solid Kim Possible movie, worthy of 3 stars. (This is on an absolute scale, not grading on a curve comparing it to other TV cartoons.) I think the DVD is overpriced, though. A better value would be the Batman Beyond videos -- only 10 bucks a disc, with six episodes per DVD. So The Drama at a $20 list price for a 70 minute animation? Seems a little greedy to me.-----

I heard the first four songs from To Where You Are on the internet, and bought the CD hoping the rest of the album would live up to that fine start. This is guitar-based rock. Jangly guitars, roaring fuzzed-out guitars, a synth added for a little texture, soaring solo guitar notes. Nothing virtuoso or flashy here -- it's all for moody effect, bathed in a full reverberent soundstage. Through it all, Kaitlyn Ni Donovan's pure smooth voice focuses the songs. Her diction is a little soft, and that tends to obscure the lyrics (not to the absurd level of Cocteau Twins), but I don't care. Her harmonies make Chinese Letters letters one of the prettiest and ethereal songs I heard all year.I was not quite as pleased with the second half of the album. The melodies and arrangements didn't strike me as addictively as those first four.I'm still glad I bought the album to encourage this band to keep refining their music. I can't think of any way they could improve the basic sound of their records. It envelopes and engages you, daring you not to listen. I could hope for more development in the lyrics, or maybe just better enunciation. And keep writing great simple melodies and harmonies. Much of this record is top-class and deserves a wider hearing.There aren't too many bands to which I could compare the sound of the High Violets. It is vaguely similar to some of the early work of Ivy, but sonically it is a little heavier and full-bodied than that. And yet, the High Violets is clearly "girl rock" with its pretty voices and melodies and sentiments. Long may they wave.

It is unfortunate that amazon is lumping 280+ reviews of the original CD release of this album in with the new remastered product. The old release was monophonic, and the 2009 remaster is stereo. (A remaster of the mono mix is available only in an expensive limited box set.) Today I purchased the new stereo remaster, and this is my report. The main reason to purchase the remastered CD is for the sound quality, so I will focus on that question.Overall, this is an improvement over the original 1987 mono CD. The bass and drums are much more distinct. The guitars are generally clean, maybe a little too clean. I could say the same about the vocals. The dynamics are compressed, but this is true of the 1987 mono edition. The compression is not extreme, but noticeable.What about a comparison with the UK stereo vinyl release? I don't have immediate access to any UK stereo pressings, but my best friend has a box set. My recollection is that you hear more subtle detail and natural reverberation from the recording studio on the vinyl than the new CD remaster. To some extent, this may be a limitation of the CD medium. (Yet my digital recordings of vinyl from my own turntable do not seem to suffer as much from this defect as commercial recordings, which is hard to fathom.) I think the new CD sounds a little too clean, too processed, with some details smoothed over a bit too much. I had the same reaction to the Beatles Let It Be... Naked album, which remixed the Let It Be album without the orchestrations and embellishments added to the original. Some of the guitars did not have the same raucous bite they had on the original CD.On the plus side, I'll reiterate that the bass and drums come through very naturally and clearly. It sounds good. It sounds clean and smooth. The best vinyl copies of A Hard Day's Night, played on an expensive turntable, will likely sound more relaxed, more dynamic, more detailed, and retreive more of the natural studio ambience of Abbey Road studio. I am unlikely to ever own the best vinyl so I'll make do with the remastered CD. And I have mixed feelings about that.

I was a Beatles and McCartney fan 30 years ago. For some reason I never got around to listening to this album until today. I probably could have just as well waited another 30 years.When McCartney's musical mind is firing on all cylinders, the result is a five-star album like Ram, Band on the Run, and Tug of War. I don't begrudge the man a little experimentation, but I find the musical and lyrical content of his first solo project rather sparse. Maybe I'm Amazed is a great song, and it receives a credible treatment here, though I frankly prefer the live version from the Wings Over America set. Junk is an endearing and perhaps enduring little ditty. Apart from those two, you may be bored out of your skull (or skulls, if you are Zaphod Beeblebrox).McCartney's most devoted fans will of course want to have this album and McCarney II, which is in the same minimalist vein. For people who have their McCartney-worshipping tendencies in check, I'd advise avoiding this record, unless you want to have it on hand to play when you have unwanted guests you want to encourage to excuse themselves and leave.Better to listen to Band on the Run for the umpteen thousandth time than this collection, most of which is throwaway material -- most of these songs could be, at best, a germ of something better. This is the sound of a great artist floundering.

George Harrison exited the Beatles with a backlog of songs he'd written but had not been able to record. Lennon and McCartney hogged most of the space on all of the Beatles' releases for their own songs. All Things Must Pass, Harrison's first major solo effort, is a solid pop/rock album with several classic tunes. The production, by Phil Spector, does seem slightly overblown, as Harrison himself notes in the CD booklet of this new Y2K remastered edition. But that was the style of the times -- the famed Wall of Sound.Many of the tracks on All Things Must Pass feature two drummers, several guitars (including an uncredited Eric Clapton), brass, woodwinds, keyboards by Gary Wright and Billy Preston, and orchestral arrangements. I like to think that this "superband" approach lends weight and impact to Harrison's songs, unlike Phil Spector's work on the Beatles' Let It Be album, which were excessive, with pointless orchestrations and choral arrangements.The remastered sound brings added clarity to what was a very dense mixture of voice, rhythm, and the twanging of many guitar strings. Still, the sound is not all that great, being positively overloaded to the point of distortion on louder songs like Wah-Wah and Let It Down.The original release featured two LPs plus a bonus LP record of studio jams. All of that material is represented in this remastered edition on 2 CDs, with additional demo recordings and a re-mix of My Sweet Lord. To quote another famous Harrison lyric, "It's all too much!"The studio jams are expendable, the demos interesting but not essential. (The quiet demo of the song All Things Must Pass found on the Beatles Anthology 3 collection is excellent, a valid alternative to the full-band treatment the song gets on this album, and I think it is unfortunate they did not include it.)George Harrison wasn't really a prolific songwriter. Good, but not prolific. He simply didn't have enough exceptional songs to make All Things Must Pass a consistent double album. The main problem with this album is a lack of editing.Disc One is where you'll find the big hits and the best material. Harrison begins with a song he co-wrote with Bob Dylan, the soft rock MOR romance I'd Have You Anytime.Next up is the superhit My Sweet Lord, which runs on repetitively like a mantra, successfully though. So does Isn't It A Pity, which reaches an orchestral and choral crescendo, repeating and repeating with variations like the outro to Hey Jude.Next comes What Is Life, a punchy pop tune with the memorable fuzz-box guitar phrase and classic slide guitar riffs. Slide guitar features prominently in the next song, Dylan's If Not For You, which turns the album toward a country music mood. Behind That Locked Door is a credible attempt by Harrison at a genuine country song.In the song Let It Down ("Let your hair hang down around me..."), the mood changes back to the sexy, slinky vibe of Harrison's hit song Something. The chorus of Let It Down is a little too agressive. It doesn't fit the tender feeling of the verse. Listen to the demo tape of Let It Down, also included on Disc One, and you'll see what I mean.Disc One highlights George Harrison's versatility as a songwriter. Disc Two is ecclectic, but more erratic in quality. It starts powerfully enough with Beware Of Darkness, but then quickly descends into whimsy with Apple Scruffs. I Dig Love ("I Dig Love... I Love Dig") is disappointingly silly. Then there's the preachiness of Awaiting On You All and trite religiosity of Art Of Dying and Hear Me Lord. Also disappointing is a second and more threadbare take on Isn't It A Pity. All Things Must Pass is pretty much the highlight of the second CD. Though listenable, the rest of the tunes are hardly top quality material.In sum, All Things Must Pass is a fine album, but only a few of the songs reach the level Harrison hit with the Beatles -- Taxman, Piggies, Here Comes The Sun, Something. Editing out some of the weaker material would have made for a tighter single-disc album. Four stars.I'm a great fan of Harrison's late-1970's work, namely his albums 33&1/3 and the self-titled George Harrison. Although the song subject matter is not as heavy on those releases, the recording and production is cleaner and tighter, and I felt the lyrics and music were more sophisticated. As good as Harrison was on All Things Must Pass, this was not his peak as a solo artist.

I recently compared the new 40th Anniversary edition of this classic CTI album with the original CD release (from 1990, I believe). I was very surprised at the differences I heard.First, the high frequencies of the 40th Anniversary have been rolled off, as if the treble control on your amplifier had been turned down substantially. On some songs, the cymbals seem to virtually disappear, and the overtones of the guitar and saxophone become muted and clouded.Second, on the majority of the 40th Anniversary tracks, the instruments of the quartet have been all bunched up in the center of the soundstage, as if the album was mixed in mono. The original CD release has a more open soundstage with sax and guitar usually on opposite channels, Ron Carter's bass and drums in the center.Third, the timing of the songs is not the same. Nuages is nearly a minute shorter in the 40th Anniversary release. Other songs vary in lesser degrees. I do not know the reason for this cutting and trimming. I don't like it.This revisionism really puzzles me. Perhaps it is closer to the original vinyl, though I do not have the vinyl so that would be speculation. Other 40th Anniversary CTI releases I have found pleasing. But this one falls short. The original CD release sounds more detailed and open. The 40th Anniversary sounds tends to sound like a 1950s recording with the highs rolled off to hide the tape hiss. But there is no bothersome hiss on the original CD to hide.They really dropped the ball on this release, in my opinion. However, if you are the type who thinks mono is better than stereo, and who is irritated by the upper overtones of the saxophone (even one played as sweetly as Paul Desmond does), then perhaps you'll find the new 40th Anniversary issue nearer to ideal.The music is great, but you probably knew that already. You'll have to choose the presentation you prefer. If you thought the earlier releases were too bright, you'll probably like this one more.

This album is not unpleasant. Grant Lee Phillips can be a great entertainer. I own his first two solo albums, and am quite happy with them.Grant has a very distinctive style of singing and some peculiar vocal affectations. His singing is as distinctive as Alanis Morrisette or Tom Waits. Once you know him, he is instantly recognizable. In his own songs, he seems to be able to make these quirks work for him. With this collection of cover songs, the result sounds slightly odd to me.Mostly the problem here is monotony. Nothing seems very lively. Grant sounds a little burned out. If these are tunes Grant really loved, he hasn't convinced me. Maybe with some inspired backing musicians and about ten cups of coffee, Grant could have laid into these songs and wrung something new and interesting from them. This may be pleasant music for relaxing, or background for doing household chores, but I'd really expect more from Grant Lee Phillips.

If you don't like progressive rock, stay away from this. The lyrics are kind of hippy-trippy. The musicianship is superb. I was blown away by the clarity of the Rhino-remastered CD. If you have the gear to appreciate it, I'd recommend the CD rather than the download. Frankly, some modern recordings are so poorly recorded and mixed that I don't sense much difference between the CD and a compressed MP3 file. (U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind being a case in point, but it is typical of many hit albums nowadays.) The Yes Album is nearly 40 years old, but the sound has a richness, detail, and sparkle to it that is remarkable. It's a great album either way, but if you get the MP3 you may not know what you're missing.

I've heard the The Yes Album's major works presented on other CD collections -- like their earlier non-Rhino box set, but Rhino's careful remastering has taken the songs to a new level of clarity. Everything -- voices, guitars, drums, keyboards, and especially Squire's bass -- sounds more detailed and at the same time more meaty, rich, and beautiful. More subtle harmonics unmasked for all to enjoy -- the sounds of fingers on strings, the Sting-like breathiness of Anderson's voice. The band's musicianship is revealed as better than previously heard -- tighter, more harmonious. Well, except that Howe's guitar solo at the end of Starship Trooper is still completely lacking in elegance and vaguely out-of-sync with the background drone of the band. Oh well, everyone has a bad day.In a word, the new Rhino remaster of The Yes Album is glorious. Probably this is the most that can be wrung out of the old master tapes. In a year they will probably try to sell you another copy of The Yes Album in SACD or DVD-Audio format, but I doubt it will improve on this. If you love The Yes Album, do not hesitate to buy the Rhino edition, which makes the old fresh as new.

I'm disappointed with the tepid reviews posted so far, and feel compelled to add my two cents. I bought this album when it first came out. Enjoyed it a lot. Then I picked up the CD later on. It is mostly solid pop music. The production is superb. Ever hear of Arif Mardin? Mardin produced million-selling, even multimillion-selling records for Norah Jones and Carly Simon, to name a couple. He knows what he's doing.Granted, the style of music varies quite a bit. It's a potpourri. There's country music (Cryin'). And mariachi (Las Brisas). Reggae-tinged (Cookin'). Fifties-style (Hey Baby, Pure Gold).All is not pure gold. This Be Called A Song is perhaps a bit optimistic for a title. It's an Eric Clapton composition, and sounds like a throwaway to me. I'll Still Love You is a bit trite, I will admit.This album simply shines with Ringo's happy-go-lucky musical personality. It doesn't have stellar songs like his previous Goodnight Vienna platter, but it's above average. Sadly the CD is out of print as I write this. Maybe sample the MP3s, avoiding the duds I mentioned?If you're new to Ringo, this isn't the place to start. But if you like Ringo's style and his other albums, give this a shot.

This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the "action" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain.

What you get here are two chock-full CDs of the best of Ahmad Jamal's trio output during the late 50s and early 60s. Maybe his absolute best output, period.Ahmad plays smoothly, melodically, adding quirky interpretations of the melody a little at a time. Sometimes he improvises by subtracting, leaving out notes or lines instead of cluttering things up with lots of notes. Then, out of nowhere will come lightning fast runs or accented notes, struck loud and proud. This is the excitement of the Ahmad Jamal Trio. Melody. Space. Silence. Surprise. Delight!This collection also contains 3/4 of the classic album Live At The Pershing -- you don't absolutely need that album if you have this one -- the essential stuff is here.Cross Country Tour is on my personal list of the 100 best albums of all time. The recording quality is a little dodgy here and there, but you can't beat the music. It has had replay after replay in my house for years.

As a casual listener, I had difficulty getting into this album, or at least I had difficulty with the drum solos, which were difficult to follow. I'm not a drummer. I enjoy many other kinds of jazz, and in fact I enjoy the albums that preceded this "collaboration" with the same participants.I'd say Elvin Jones stretches out and does his own thing a lot more on this CD than the others. This might be very instructive and entertaining for drummers and jazz technicians. For me, not so much. I don't fault the playing ability or even the interpretations here. I'm only saying that I didn't find them as enjoyable as other Great Jazz Trio outings.

Diana Krall recently gave an extended interview for National Public Radio, available at their website (you can still hear it there in streaming Windows Media if anyone is interested), and I learned that Diana started singing relatively late, professionally at least. Possibly that explains why I always judged that her singing and her piano playing were on two different levels. Both are precise and technically proficient and entertaining, but her piano playing moves me more than her vocals. I consider her piano improvisation more advanced because she is better able to communicate emotion through that vehicle. However, there is a point where she began to come into her own as a singer, and the turning point is right here, Live in Paris.This DVD documents a superb concert, the best kind of jazz imaginable. Krall is not one of those jazz artists who will indulge herself in ten minutes of instrumental noodling -- good, bad, and indifferent -- boring her audience and stealing time from her bandmates. Krall sings her part, plays her little variations, and generously lets the guitar, drums, and bass into the conversation too. An orchestra adds texture and schmaltz for pop tunes where such is appropriate -- this is not a criticism at all. The arrangements are gorgeous.Back to the singing. On many of these standards, Diana gives what I would call a bloodless rendition. (But then I would have characterized the entire Look of Love production as bloodless.) She delivers the lyric without acting it out in any sense. I'm thinking of a kind of Carmen McRae coolness here -- a precision that can blunt emotional involvement. (Not that Carmen was always detached, but she did tend to project that quality.) Watching Diana's facial expressions, I don't often see joy or melancholy as she sings, but more bemusement or detachment or maybe a wince or frown that seems more like affectation. This is the same impression I had of Diana Krall even when I couldn't watch her perform -- when I heard her Look of Love CD and her CD tribute to Nat Cole.I wrote before of a turning point. On The Look of Love, oddly enough, a classy tune but hardly a jazz standard, I begin to hear Diana start to truly sell the lyric. And again on her closing number, Joni Mitchell's A Case of You, she let's her hair down and steps right into the song, letting us feel it too, through her voice. These are the seeds of Diana Krall's evolution as a vocalist -- seeds that are obviously blossoming on her new CD, The Girl in the Other Room. I can only applaud this, and hope for more. I was very enthused with The Girl in the Other Room.Overall, the vibe was right for these performances. All the players are consummate professionals, and they are obviously having a great time -- which means that it is hard for the audience not to have a great time watching them have a great time. Normally I am bored with bass and drum solos, but the team here swings with gusto, and their dynamic and melodic variations add genuine interest. Everything on this disc is consistently good, period.I am almost prepared to pronounce Live in Paris the best concert DVD I've seen. No one could fault the song selection. Diana is obviously pleased to be working with her band, pleased that her parents are in the audience, inspired by an orchestra and fine arrangements to back her up. The concert stretches a generous 110 minutes, with extra footage from rehearsals and two music videos. If you like Diana Krall or smooth jazz in general, this disc should have much replay value. I'm looking forward to many reruns myself. I can only give it 4 stars because for me, five star ratings are to be reserved for classic DVDs like Lawrence of Arabia or Fellowship of the Ring. In the music DVD genre, this title has few peers. Get it, watch it, love it.Thank God I have friends with great taste who loan me movies like this!

Many good and true things have already been written by other customers. The sets and props tend to look a little on the cheap side. The special effects almost always betray their computer-generated origin. But none of this really matters. These are characters and conflicts we can care about, stories that play out the great themes of and human experience and history, carried into the future of 300 years hence -- making sly comments about contemporary society in the telling of those tales. The acting is adequate to fantastic. But the story's the main thing.I am a Star Trek fan too, but the technobabble on various incarnations of that show is a major annoyance. In Babylon 5, there is a refreshing lack of any need to explain unexplainable technology in Babble-on-speak. Hyperspace is hyperspace. We accept it. The less said the better. The weapons blast and zap, we don't need to know why. Do we? Babylon 5 does not obsess about propulsion systems, particles, warp fields and cores, and the viewer is better able to focus on the characters and their motivations within the events around them. Also, Babylon 5 does not fall back on stale time travel stories when they are at a loss for plot lines. As it should be.All seasons of Babylon 5 were good, but Seasons 3 and 4 were the best of all. All serious fans of science fiction owe it to themselves to see this series.

Apparently this adaptation of Mansfield Park is not faithful to the book, which I've not read. Well, even Lord of the Rings, as great as it was, deviated from the book.I would prefer to take this film on its own terms. This evening I finished watching it for the fifth or sixth time. I appreciate as much or more now as the first viewing. Perhaps I just have a "thing" for Frances O'Connor, but this film has many virtues beside her performance. The photography is beautiful, with several artful uses of slow motion. The dialogue is well-tuned and well-delivered. The plot is not confusing. There is subtlety, sensitivity, a hundred little finely-honed details. Above all, the movie ingratiates us to the main character, her spunk and her feelings of inadequacy, her sweetness. Those qualities carry us through the movie. This is a film I want to revisit because this is a character I'm endeared to.I'm not saying you have to love it. Give it a chance. If you must have near-purity to the original text, look elsewhere if you must. For my money, this version beats the new Billie Piper BBC edition hands down in every category.

First, the sound quality: Bob Ludwig is one of the best mastering engineers in the business, but there is only so much he can do with a poor master. This album suffers from poor recording, poor mixing, and possibly poor recording technology. It has all the earmarks of early digital -- especially the tizzy and brittle high frequencies. Ludwig seems to have filtered these out somewhat, bringing the midrange to the fore. That makes Sting's voice more natural. Generally, the sax and keyboards do not have the definition and impact they should. The drums come through with a fair amount of impact, though the timbre of the drums is not at all natural. You can hear the bang and the "thwack" but not so much the skin and the distinctive metallic shimmer of the cymbals, which sound more like white noise. In other words, the remaster tries to minimize some of the deficiencies of the original recording, but it cannot remake the record. The microphones were perhaps poorly placed or poorly equalized, and the instruments arise out of a kind of indistinct general foggy cloud. The piano and sax were mixed a little too low at times -- lacking body and not cutting through in the mix during solos -- especially the keyboards.OK, the sound is what it is. We can't change it. But your enjoyment will not suffer much if you buy the old out-of-print first CD release. Yes, the remaster is better. Not massively better.These concerts were recorded in France and Italy in 1985. Sting chose a band of some of the finest jazz players for his bass, keyboard, drum and sax backing band. Sting plays electric guitar on this tour. After all the critical things I said about the sound, the band itself is great. The songs are recognizable tunes from Sting's Police and early solo days. But here they are re-imagined, re-arranged, and in many cases amped up in energy. The drumming in particular has both the slam and slap of rock but also the intricacy and subtlety and syncopation of jazz. The late Kenny Kirkland's piano/keyboard solos are energetic and rhythmic and complex. Branford Marsalis adds a harmonious saxophone counterpoint to Sting's voice.This may be the best band Sting has ever played with. There is much to recommend this set. It has a great deal of energy and infectious musical grooves. The arrangements are, as I said, different and imaginative -- though more jazzy/bluesy at times. Highly recommended on this basis.If you want to hear the subtleties, you'll have to listen hard through the muddle of a mediocre recording. I've heard bootlegs that sound better than this. Still, it's very enjoyable, it's a great concert, and worth hearing if you like Sting/Police much at all.

Nice spacious sound. Infectious beats. Some of the tracks take a run at avant garde jazz with stabs of trumpet, flute, clarinet fluttering around the mix.The music definitely creates a mood.Where does the album fall short? The songs are rhythmic jams on one or two chords. With very limited melodic lines, the vocals resemble rapping as much as singing. Within the very limited overall musical structure, the production is very sophisticated and well-arranged.Hypnotic to a degree. With the ability of these tracks to invoke a moood, it would be perfect soundtrack material for a film or TV show. (The track Black Cat Bone was featured on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.) I bought the album and I'm enjoying it. It's worth 3 1/2 stars, and honestly it is superior to many other contenders in the electronic loop-based music genre. Ideally I prefer something a bit more akin to a traditional pop song structure and production. I can appreciate Laika as well.Give it a try if you think this might be up your alley.

One of the few perfect pop music albums made in the past 25 years. If there was a college class on how to make a pop record, Utopia Parkway should be the primary textbook.There are no filler tracks on the album. Zero.Great melodies. Great hooks. Sly little songs like Denise, Laser Show, and Lost in Space don't wear out their welcome. They come in like a cool, refreshing breeze and are gone in less than 2 minutes. Never does this album drag. A few semi-serious songs will make you think, like the nostalgic Prom Theme. Mostly FoW is about having a good time, describing ordinary life with wit, in a perfect musical context. They know exactly when to use acoustic guitars, electric guitars, a cheesy synth, or a soaring string part.Fountains of Wayne are able to express genuine pity in songs like Go Hippie and Fine Day For A Parade, but even here their sense of humor and intelligence never flags. Hippie contains a classic guitar solo that recycles every stereotypical riff and effect from the psychedelic era and spits it out in one minute. I love it! You will smile with recognition and thrill to the beauty of it.Sometimes it is easier to list an album's flaws than its strengths. Honestly, after a dozen listens to Utopia Parkway, I can't find any flaws. If pressed, I would say that lead vocalist Chris Collingwood's voice is slightly thinner and weaker than on FoW's latest studio record, Welcome Interstate Managers, but for this type of music, it is hardly necessary to have the chops of a Billy Joel or the power of a Springsteen to pull it off. And Chris does, in spades.Red Dragon TatooIt's just about on meI got it for youSo now do you want meWith nothing to proveWill you be my honeyOh yeahIn you I confideRed dragon tatooI'm fit to be dyedAm I fit to have you?This chorus from the second song on Utopia Parkway sums up the humor, simplicity, and cleverness of Fountains of Wayne. Like Interstate Managers, Utopia Parkway's songs are written from a middle-class suburban perspective. And what's wrong with that? FoW are us. Arguably this is a better album than their latest and more famous Welcome Interstate Managers, but really both albums are five star efforts. Don't be in the dark about this great band.

This album shows a wide range of lyrical and musical talent -- a talent for whimsy and humor, sympathy, melody, harmony, and rich production that overlays guitars, keyboards, and vocals into a beautiful pop soundscape. They can rock out too, as on Go Hippie and Denise. I suppose one could say it is a little lightweight, but writing the pop music equivalent of The Wall is not Fountains of Wayne's forte. It is what it is.The Asian import adds a beautiful romantic bonus track, I Know You Well. It is not a throwaway song -- it stands equal in quality to the rest of the album.The sound of the import, on my system, seems to be tilted more toward the midrange and bass, with a bit less zing in the high frequencies. That's not necessarily a bad thing. The USA release is a little on the bright side.

Composers are not necessarily the best performers of their own work. A songwriter's songwriter like Jules Shear or Jimmy Webb comes to mind -- surely the best representations of their songs are on other artist's albums.This album is charming in its own way -- a taste of the music and performance style of a bygone era. Someone complained that these rolls were edited. So what? I'm going to review the final product, now how it was made. Do you eat sausage? Ask not what's in it!I like to listen to this CD in short bits -- a few songs at a time. For some reason I find it to be fatiguing if I listen for more than 20 minutes or so. I'm not absolutely sure why this is so. Possibly the meter is just a little too metronomic on many of the songs. This lends a "mechanical" quality to the performances.Additionally, I felt that the dynamic range was restricted. The music does get louder and softer, because of the piano rolls themselves and because of the computer programming used to read the piano rolls -- the dynamics were deliberately adjusted by the record producers in some spots, if I read the liner notes correctly. And yet. And yet. Still these songs do not dynamically "breathe" fully in and out the way they ought to. I find this disappointing, but I think it has something to do with inherent limitations in piano roll recording technique. I'm guessing.Taken for what it is, it is an interesting concept, and the sound quality is very pleasant. The performances are very good for piano rolls, but fall short of what a good interpreter could do. Take, for example, the Rhapsody in Blue from Woody Allen's Manhattan soundtrack. Listen specifically to the piano part -- the dynamics and variations in rhythm. This is not by any means the best performance of Rhapsody, but it is better than the Gershwin rolls.

Paul Mccartney is still a great live performer. He gives a rousing performance of mostly old Beatles tunes and a few Wings hits. I have no problem with the performance or the sound. If you close your eyes, it is a very good live album. But the whole point of a DVD is to be able to SEE the concert, and on this level it is going to be very unpleasant for a lot of people.Every bleeping second they switch cameras, the camera pans or zooms, or there is a boom shot where the camera tracks across or down. There is no doubt that a little camera movement can add interest to a concert film. And cutting to different cameras allows the audience to see views of the other players and different angles one might not ordinarily see. In this Red Square concert, these principles have been overdone time ten. Watching this video gave me a headache, literally. The eye cannot focus on anything, study anything, or really enjoy anything because the objects you are trying to view are always moving around on the screen, or are there so briefly (one or two seconds) that you barely get a chance to see them before the image is snatched away. If this sort of editing bothers you at all -- stay away from this DVD, because this is the worst example I have ever seen.I like McCartney and the Beatles. I'm not one of those snobs who looks down on McCartney's silly love songs and melodic compositions in comparison to the gutsier quality of some of Lennon's work. I own all but the early Beatles CDs, and most of McCartney's solo albums up through Tug of War. The man is a musical genius and a fantastic performer.But, I think the worshipfulness and praise heaped on him by the Russians in the documentary sections -- which are annoyingly and needlessly sandwiched between the Red Square performances -- is way over the top. To listen to these babblers, you'd think that the Beatles were the prime cause of the fall of the Soviet Union. And that McCartney personally tore down the Berlin Wall. For McCartney to have approved these segments proves that McCartney is all about polishing his own idol these days. It's nauseating.Regardless, people go to concerts because they want to be entertained, and McCartney did that for the lucky Russians in the audience in Red Square and also the bonus tunes from Saint Petersberg. On this DVD, the quick cut/pan/zoom editing impedes the enjoyment I might have had. That's inexcusable. I've seen other McCartney concert films that were not afflicted with this editing disease. I'm going to seek those out instead.

IN Search of Shakespeare is a 4-part documentary shown on PBS recently. I missed the first part, but watched with increasing interest the last three. Rarely have I found a documentary so engaging and ultimately moving. I should also mention that it is beautifully photographed.It was written and presented enthusiastically by host/narrator Michael Wood. Wood travels to the original scenes, sometimes the original buildings associated with various stages of Shakespeare's life. He goes into the archives and lets us see with our own eyes original documents like wills, legal documents, contemporary books, theater schedules, etc., that pertain directly to Shakespeare. He follows the modern Royal Shakespeare Company on tour, and we see scenes from Shakespeare's plays and other plays contemporary with Shakespeare. Most importantly, we learn about the events of history, politics, and Shakespeare's personal life that intersect with the plays and sonnets he wrote.Can you really "know" Shakespeare by watching a four hour documentary? Hardly. I think his true beliefs are enigmatic, and whatever he expressed in his plays was necessarily limited by the censorship and political expediencies of his time. But his was a great art, and this biographical documentary gives us at least a hint of what lay behind that great art. Context is always helpful.Even Shakespeare's greatest rival -- in a folio of Shakespeare's plays published after his death as a tribute that would allow future generations to remember and appreciate hitherto unpublished works -- wrote of William S., "He was a man not for our time, but for all time."

Yep, those animated dogfights are spectacular. The rest of the movie is a bust.I like slow contemplative movies, but only when there is substance in the film to contemplate. The whole premise for this movie fails the suspension of disbelief test.I would have enjoyed watching Ghost in the Shell for the umpteenth time more than I got out of seeing Sky Watchers once. I suppose it is worth a Netflix rental just to see the dogfights. You can safely skip everything else.Also, there's a discontinuity that I found odd, some may find jarring. There is a tremendous amount of realistic texture and detail in the backgrounds, the furniture, the airplanes, the clouds, etc., which I assume is a triumph of computer aided animation technique. The human characters appear as if they are traditional cheap hand-drawn animation cells -- with minimal detail and texture in the skin, clothing, etc. This is a flaw -- if you're going to go for hyper-realism in animation, then go all the way.

My Dad was a Sinatra fan. We twice thoroughly enjoyed watching a tape I made of a PBS Great Performances broadcast of Sinatra's best television appearances (sadly unavailable on DVD). My own appreciation of Sinatra has grown over the years. When our library purchased this CD, I was eager to audition it.I agree that Sinatra was at a peak vocally when he recorded this album. Some of his live performances are more loose, but in later years his voice was not up to par. It's a matter of taste. I am perfectly happy with the subtle yet expressive variations that Sinatra uses to perform these songs, many of them classics.I was less happy with the Nelson Riddle arrangements. They seem excessively busy. They call attention to themselves when they ought to lay back and let the focus be on the soloist, i.e. Sinatra.Riddle infuses his charts with little ornamentations, flourishes that strike me as a bit hokey, even clownish at times -- invention and variety for its own sake, rather than supporting and deepening the underlying rhythm, chord structure, and melody of the composition. My description here perhaps makes them sound a little more annoying than they actually are. Certainly some songs on this album evidence these flaws more than others. I am far from having encyclopedic knowledge of the big arrangers of the era gone by, but I've heard many by Claus Ogerman, and as a point of contrast, I think he was more serious and at the same time laid back in his charts. Here again, it is a matter of taste. I thought the orchestra called too much of the wrong kind of attention to itself too often on Songs for Swingin' Lovers.In the final analysis, with great songs and Sinatra himself in great form, I still have to dock one star off a perfect five for the arrangements, which distract me from time to time with their obtrusive, pointless, sometimes silly little flourishes.On the topic of sound quality, although I have not heard the original CD release, the remastered version truly does sound sub-par. Sinatra's upper registers, brass, strings, all seem to suffer from some subtle distortion that smudges detail and creates a sort of odd, artificial electronic haze. Really, hearing-impaired people should not be involved in mastering classic albums. Whoever did the job on Songs for Swingin' Lovers should probably be doing something more suited to his talents, like driving a cab. Although it is hard to put your finger on it exactly, there is something most definitely "wrong" with the sound. I'm fairly familiar with what recordings from the mid-50s sound like, and I can't believe the original master tape of this Sinatra record ever sounded as bad as this. I may buy this album -- its reputation as a classic is deserved (with my reservation about the arranging) -- but if I do, I will seek out the early release, not the later remastered CD.

Norah's debut was special, her second was a bit of a sophomore slump, but at least half of it was very entertaining. This is just substandard. Mainly the problem here is the songs, which are mediocre at best. Norah and her bassist/boyfriend can write good songs, they just can't write an album full of them. Plus here they seem to have had writers block, but continued to churn out songs anyway. Everything about this album sounds tired, listless. It has a going-through-the-motions quality. I don't care that it is slow and dreamy. I like slow and dreamy. What I don't like is slow and boring to the point of tears.Norah did a kind of grunge rock thing last summer, playing surprise gigs in New York clubs under the name "El Madmo," which was much more fun than this. There's no El Madmo album, but you might still be able to find a couple of songs floating around the internets or on MySpace. Also, she was in a band called The Little Willies, and some of her work on that record is worth a listen. If you haven't heard it already, her album with the Peter Malick group, New York City, is decent as well. My point is that this album would be a waste of cash, because there is nothing memorable here. Nothing at all. But if you need a Norah Jones fix, you would be better served by buying one of those other albums I recommended.Norah is best suited to recording classic songs and putting her spin on them, as she did with wonderful results in the case of that Duke Ellington tune on the previous album, and Cold Cold Heart on her debut. It would be better if she took the Madeleine Peyroux route, by adding her own songs judiciously, as much quality output as she can compose. But with this album, it sounds like the well has, for the moment, run dry. Norah has finally become Snore-ah. ZZZzzzzzzzzzz. "Wake Me Up" indeed!

I would not have bothered to write a review, except that other opinions were mostly extremely negative or extremely positive, which does not represent the movie fairly, in my opinion.This movie has a cute, fairy-tale plot which neither repulses nor excites. A lot of action. It might be fun to see this film remade in live action. A lot of fantastic Indiana-Jones type of chases and escapes. The dubbing is adequate, but certainly far from the top-notch job Disney did on Kiki's Delivery Service, for example. Miyazaki's films are always beautiful to look at. Oh, I did find the music a little on the schmaltzy/cheesy side.It is fun to watch once or twice, but I honestly can't see what anyone would find to strongly love or strongly hate about this product. The greatest animated movie ever? Nah. Just a sweet, watchable, passable Miyazaki effort that doesn't take itself too seriously (which Princess Mononoke possibly does do).If this sort of thing is your cup of tea, don't be deterred by the nit-pickers who only gave it one star. If you are hoping to be blown away, you'll probably be disappointed. Before seeing this, I had seen Totoro, Kiki, and Mononoke, and I considered this a lesser film, a slight let-down. Still not bad, though.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is not as overtly funny as Small Time Crooks, and the concept is a little dated.Woody plays a claims investigator/detective for an insurance company. Dan Aykroyd is memorable as Woody's boss, and Helen Hunt is a driven efficiency expert aiming to tighten up the corporate ship, possibly by outsourcing the investigations and firing the in-house talent.Curse is an homage to an earlier, gentler style of comedy, appearing to be set in the 1930s or 40s. The humor depends on suspension of disbelief regarding a hypnotist who programs Woody to behave totally out of character, and the old movie plotline of love developing between opposites who attract is resurrected. The story resolves when the investigator solves the mystery of his own behavior.I found the characters loveable, the dialogue snappy. The whole film has a kind of warm human glow. Don't expect to fall on the floor holding your sides with laughter. But you ought to smile, and Woody is out of fashion enough to give us a happy ending.

If I were able to completely suppress all my critical thinking skills and accept whatever is happening on the screen, perhaps this would have been an amusing movie for me, instead of a maddeningly frustrating one. But I am not able to do that.Can you accept the premise that a super-rich mogul would spend a "trillion dollars" to finance an expedition to an earth-like planet in search of ancient astronauts who might, just might, have been the parents of the human race? Fine. Then can you accept that for this trillion dollar mission they would pick the most unprofessional, unscientific, incautious staff who proceed to ignore every sound principle of archaeological investigation, lab quarantine, and common sense?If you can't accept supposedly educated, trained, technically skilled people doing one moronic and dangerous thing after another, then about halfway through this film you just might be fighting the urge to throw heavy objects at the screen, or bang your head against the wall.On the other hand, if you enjoy typical horror films where people, through their typically unthinking behavior, put themselves in greater and greater danger and end up running from said danger until they meet with dismemberment and death, this is the sci-fi equivalent.This is a blot on Ridley Scott's filmography. Also, the slipcover on the DVD claims that Roger Ebert rated this four stars and called it "magnificent." If this is not an out-of-context quote, it is another sign that Roger Ebert's opinion is no longer of any use to the movie going public.The special effects are indeed magnificent. If that's all you're interested in, Prometheus is five-star material. For me, it fails to meet even the lowest standard of suspension-of-disbelief necessary to enjoy a proper science fiction film.

I've seen some of the new CGI effects, and some are very nice. Others, flat and artificial. In that sense, they aren't any more "real" than the original grainy footage done with mattes and models.But even if the new effects were state of the art, they are married to an old series where the sets are obviously plywood and cheap paint. The heavy makeup is not subtle either. Some of the medical instruments are literally oddly-shaped salt shakers. The rocks on the planet surfaces are a plastic or styrofoam-type material. This show was not meant for high definition. It was meant for standard definition analog television transmission. If you like seeing all the flaws, fine. That's not my bag, and maybe not yours either.For me, the remastering is an exercise in futility. The show was what it was -- episodic S-F done quickly on a relatively modest budget. I loved the show, and spent a lot of my own time and effort trying to get the show revived back in the 1970s. All of you who enjoyed The Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and the motion pictures can thank me and those like me -- who convinced Paramount that there was a real market for the continuing franchise.But I've bought the first DVD sets of The Original Series, and I think they are a better representation of the show. Feel free to buy what you like, but newer is not necessarily better. Higher definition is not necessarily better. Why is it better to see all the pores on Captain Kirk's nose? To me, that's a distraction. The script's the thing. The acting is the thing. The anachronistic sets and costumes and grainy shots of spacecraft models... well, you're going to have to suspend your disbelief. Shakespeare had the worst special effects and sets imaginable back in his Globe Theater days. Imagination beats CGI any day of the week. Ultimately, the CGI does not look "real" either. And it clashes with the style of the live-action footage.I fear that many purchases of these remastered editions will be knee-jerk responses by fans enticed by something new and different, without regard to whether it is truly an improvement. If you think the new mastering and effects significantly adds to the joy of this classic series, then that is certainly a valid reason to buy. I only want to caution people that they may have the same tepid reaction I have.

I'm not that familiar with Phish or any of their players except Trey Anastasio. I am familiar with Kottke, especially his better outings on the Private Music label -- namely, Regards From Chuck Pink, My Father's Face, and Peculiaroso. Compared to those records, this one is aimless piffle. Kottke sometimes has a problem developing musical tension in his music. It starts out at a given volume and tempo, clatters along for awhile with his busy sixteenth notes, and then quits. I think there's a similar problem here, along with a lack of appealing melody. Most of these songs bored me before I even got through the track. Skip to the next. More boredom. Skip to the next. Yawn.I won't even describe the abomination of copy protection software Sony/BMG has infected this disc with. Others have justly expressed their disdain.Anyway, I like Leo Kottke, just not *this* Leo Kottke. I borrowed this from the library, and it is quite a disappointment. If Kottke would record another Chuck Pink-level effort, I'd buy it (if it wasn't infested with malicious software). I am pleased to own the albums I mentioned.

I did not have high hopes for this film. It is mercifully short (85 minutes), which almost merits a star by itself -- filmmakers today cannot just tell a story and be done with it. They think they must add layers and drag it on for over two hours.The movie opens on a street corner somewhere in Ireland. A guy with a guitar is playing his modern folk tunes (what we'd now call "indie music") with his guitar case open for tips and contributions. After an altercation with a druggie who tries to steal his guitar case, cut to the nighttime, when he is wailing out a very personal song of woe, strumming loudly and emphatically. A young woman walks up and throws ten pence in his case, asking him if he wrote the song. An acquaintance is struck -- she is a Czehk immigrant who sells flowers on the street and does domestic cleaning. He's a vacuum cleaner repair man by day, working in his Dad's shop. But they both love to sing/play music, and dabble in writing it. Over the course of a couple of weeks, they work together to flesh out some songs he's written and record them, as the guy starts moving seriously toward trying to make it in the music biz.This film is one of the most charming things I've seen in years. It is a small film, a simple story about simple people with dreams, struggling with heartache and poor circumstances, who create something together, and in the process learn a bit about themselves and find a sudden, new, and deep friendship and love. It is amazing how authentic and real it comes off, amazing because this was a tiny movie, probably shot on video instead of film, cheap to make, with unknown actors. Yet Hollywood cannot seem to make a film that takes the audience into a friendship with living, breathing, real characters that you can't help but have immense affection for by the time the final credits roll. I can't say it never happens, but usually I'm painfully aware of contrivances and manipulations, poorly disguised.The central theme of the movie, the core around which everything revolves, is The Guy's songwriting and The Girl's collaboration with him in creating and performing it to make a demo recording. It is not really my kind of music. It is the music of simple feelings, performed by people who do not have perfect, trained voices. Forgive my Irish, but I'd call it "sad b*stard music," because it's about heartache and longing and misunderstanding and reaching out for connection and love. The melodies are sometimes pretty, but it's main virtue is that it is sincere, if not often very poetic (by my standards). The great thing about it is that you can believe that these characters could write these songs, because they aren't that sophisticated. (Unlike the recent August Rush, where a child who has never played an instrument suddenly becomes a performing and composing prodigy. Talk about a leap.)And that's what stands out about this movie. Sincerity. Hard to find in a modern motion picture. I may not watch this multiple times, but I found it very moving, in a positive way.There is some bad language, perhaps authentic, but totally unnecessary. This could easily be redubbed and turned into a PG or even a G film.

When I finally saw this DVD on a Netflix rental, I was amazed at how good it was. I was expecting disappointment based on the reviews here, and I think that's because most of them were too focused on what was missing.This DVD is getting low marks from many of the 380 reviewers here because it is not the same as the Babylon 5 TV series. Certainly this was done on the cheap. The WB people have made tens, maybe hundreds of millions on the original series, but still they didn't want to spring for a full budget made-for-DVD release. Those were the constraints. Therefore, JMS (don't ask me to spell Babylon 5's creator's last name) wrote a script that could conform to the budget -- very few sets, very few actors, lots and lots of computer generated backgrounds.However, this "movie" tells two great stories set in the Babylon 5 universe that do not require many sets or a large cast. For success, it only needed good dialogue and good acting to deliver that dialogue. Think back to one of the better Star Trek Original Series episodes, "Court Marshall." This was largely a courtroom drama. It consisted mostly of people talking. The cast of Babylon 5 The Lost Tales is perhaps equivalent to Court Marshall, with fewer extras. And there's a lot of talking. If that sort of thing bores you, you can skip this DVD. But if you can't enjoy two very good little dramas just because there aren't any space battles or people blasting phasers at one another, or attacking each other with swords and knives, then you really are missing out.The first "tale" is a little bit like an Outer Limits episode, about the B5 Captain calling in a priest because she fears one of her crew may be possessed and may require an exorcism. The second tale is about President Sheridan's return for an anniversary celebration on B5. A technomage shows Sheridan the future in a dream, a future of destruction and death for millions. Sheridan can stop this future, but only by committing murder.Both of these stories are well-told and well-acted. The demon-possessed man and the priest in the first tale are both superb. In the second tale, Boxleitner's President Sheridan displays the kind of authority that comes with power, the annoyance with its downside, and the plot hinges on the moral dilemma, 'Would you have killed Hitler as a child, if you had the chance?' The technomage is well-played, too. The first tale also involves a moral dilemma: Exactly how do you deal with evil and how do you extract the truth from a confirmed liar?What this DVD movie IS, is two excellent stories, told in a way that does not require an extensive cast or lots of interior sets. We can hope for future movies that will include all of that. But these stories almost *could* have been told effectively with sock puppets, as JMS jokingly hints. Our imaginations can make up for what is lacking, if the actors do their jobs. With the computer graphics on display here, we need not even imagine anything. It's all been done for us.Is this DVD worth purchasing? Well, it is certainly worth seeing. I watched it twice before returning it to Netflix. I am notoriously cheap. Compared to the value you can get by buying one of the B5 season sets when they go on sale for $20-25, this is not a good value. Still, I would pay $5-6 to own this. Perhaps I will buy it through a DVD club.

I consider this show to have had great potential. The special effects are great. Everything has the look and feel of a gritty ship, a collection of people on the run in spaceships. And the acting and dialog is very good, believable most of the time. This season suffers from several flaws that knock it down from fantastic to merely ordinary.First and foremost, the lack of any heroes. I'm not sure there are any characters in the show I have much affection for. Starbuck was annoying from day one. When she was written out of the show (I assume she's probably back in season four, but I don't have cable, so that will have to wait), I was happy that I'd get a break from her for at least a few episodes. There is hardly any joy on Galactica, and little reason for any. They're going to all connive and bicker and backstab and frak and booze their way back to Earth, apparently. Just when I start liking any of the characters, they go off and do something half-cocked or mean or stupid or selfish, and I return to ambivalence or outright hatred for them.In season three, there are too many (one would be too many) soap opera-ish episodes focusing on the sordid personal affairs and traumas of the sordid characters. As a result, finding the way to Earth and trying to understand what the Cylons are playing at -- the main plot arcs -- get cheated. In other words, they do a lot of treading water.Visually, the frequent use of handheld cameras that bounce around -- the field of view veering off left, right, up, down, jerking, jiggling constantly -- is irritating. If one were watching this on a big screen it could induce motion sickness. I can't remember the first season's visuals, but I'm sure this criticism applies to season two as well. If you've made it this far into the series, you've gotten used to it. It still can be an annoyance.But for all that, the show has its moments. Some of the courtroom scenes in the trial of The Great Weasel Baltar are particularly effective. The first few episodes telling of the escape from slavery to the Cylons on New Caprica are almost worthy of a motion picture. These successes make the weakness of the episodes in between all the more glaring.I'm looking at season three as something I had to mostly wade through to get to what will hopefully be an impressive conclusion to the big mysteries they've developed in the series.

Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in the early 1950s. This one-hour feature documents Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl's voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a balsa-wood raft, to simulate how South American natives might possibly have voyaged west and settled in the islands of Polynesia.Crude, black-and-white grainy 16mm film, simple English narration. The production is bare-bones. But I've seen this film two or three times. Instead of "reality TV" which is far from reality, this is reality. Five guys who set out in a boat they did not know would be able to survive the distance, finding out by hard experience what it might have been like for any ancient mariner who tried to do the same.Many days were calm, and the crew could lash the steering paddle down, letting the wind and the current carry them toward their Polynesian goal. They could get in a basket below the water line and watch the ocean life, or float lazily away from the main raft in a rubber lifeboat.Every morning they got up and picked up the flying fish that had landed on the raft and been stranded. Breakfast! At other times they speared and clubbed dolphin fish (not dolphins) for a change of meat. They caught many sharks, mainly to discourage them from following the raft. They worried about whales and other large fish, but were never troubled by them.In about three month's time, they arrived in Polynesia and were driven toward the coast of a small island. They very nearly were wrecked on the reef. It was by no means certain that they would make it safely to shore, but finally the raft came to rest and they were able to unload the important equipment, set up on shore, and radio their successful landing and their position. They met natives (wearing Western clothing) and eventually a boat was sent to retrieve them.It is a simple story, told in a straightforward way. It doesn't seem especially dramatic, but it is authentic. Five men in a raft, surviving the elements, testing themselves, reaching their goal and a place in the history books.

Let's see. Three solo albums for Fagen in 24 years. So he's not churning them out so fast that quality has to suffer.Admittedly The Nightfly from '82 was and is a masterpiece album. It holds up to repeated listening even now. Kamikiriad, 11 years later, was well-crafted, perhaps less well-loved, but I listened to it a lot when it came out. I'm not drawn back to it, and perhaps the very cold, dead, ultra-digital sound has something to do with that.After a successful Steely Dan revival, Fagen returned to solo work. What have we got in Morph the Cat? Digital recording technology has definitely improved since Kamikiriad, and Morph is more natural sounding, though still acoustically sterile with very little ambiance apart from digital echo/reverb.I don't know the running time, but these 8 1/2 songs (8 songs plus a reprise of the title track) seem to run a lot longer than the songs on The Nightfly, which were reasonably concise and compact -- I think that was part of their charm. My view is that many of the songs on Morph could have a minute or two chopped out of them, which would only improve them.The instrumentation and arrangements are very familiar, very similar to his other solo albums, similar to Steely Dan with less guitar evident. The musicians are precise, crack accompanists and soloists. No complaints there. Fagen's voice is easier to take than in the early Steely Dan days, and his harmony overdubbing has only gotten better.It's all pleasantly listenable, and my favorite tracks are Morph the Cat, H Gang, The Night Belongs To Mona, and Mary Shut The Garden Door. If I was a download-buying consumer, I'd snatch those and leave the rest.This album isn't bad by any means, it's just pale compared to his greater solo and band work. Not much pizazz. I see it was self-produced. Maybe Donald needs a better editor, a more critical voice in the process. I hope Fagen has one more album left in him of the quality of Aja or Two Against Nature or The Nightfly. Keep your ear to the ground and cross your fingers.

As a tour de force of digital special effects technique, this is a five star demonstration project. I'm sure it will drum up a great deal of future business for ILM, Lucas' special FX shop.My best capsule review for SW Episode III is: George Lucas succumbs to the Dark Side of digital filmmaking and forgets how to tell a story.The only part of this film that felt emotionally involving and believable was the final duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin. The rest of it was by-the-numbers. The characters did as the script bid them, but the audience cannot identify with and enjoy the characters like the original Star Wars Episode IV. Lucas has tried to turn campy comic-book fun (the original 1977 movie) into a legitimate drama and failed utterly.A very heavy book could be written on the lack of acting finesse demonstrated by Hayden whats-his-face. I know that Natalie Portman can act, but what happened to Padme? In Episode I she is a brave leader, and in this installment she's become a emotional doormat, her instincts completely overpowered by her (unconvincing) love and devotion to her immature husband. This is not Portman's fault. Lucas gets all the blame.My reaction to this is a big yawn. Lucas sucked all the fun out of Star Wars. I'm sure glad I checked this out from the library and did not waste even a couple bucks on a video rental.Then again, if all you want is amazing visuals, whether or not they contribute to involving and logical storytelling, be my guest -- this is the tops.

Don't watch this if you are subject to becoming depressed by sad movies. The Sweet Hereafter is, however, one of those films that has a dreamlike quality that sucks you in. The art of it is very appealing to me. Some will say it is slow, too quiet, a downer. But I think the emotion of it provides more than enough intensity.The movie is based on a novel which is itself somewhat based on a true story of a small town in Texas where tragically many of the town's children were killed in a schoolbus accident, and ambulance-chasing lawyers descended on the town like a swarm of hungry locusts. The townspeople eventually received hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from a company which may or may not have really been responsible for the accident.The movie takes this premise in a different direction. It focuses on one lawyer who comes to town and interviews witnesses, survivors, and moms and dads who lost their kids. The lawyer himself is going through a vaguely similar personal crisis -- losing his daughter to drugs. Great disruption is bubbling in the town because of the tragedy and the impending, potentially enriching, lawsuit. The ending is a surprise, turning everything upside down for a reason that has nothing to do with the accident, and no one will ever likely know the real reason.What is the movie really about? It is about grief turning to boiling anger, mixed with greed. It is about the secret lives of ordinary people in small towns. It is about how justice can be meted out in strange ways.I saw this several years ago, and then again this week. Both times I was riveted.

The first time I saw Eyes Wide Shut, I focused on the revelation of the perversions of the rich and powerful. They have moved beyond morality. They believe they can get away with anything. Sadly, as we see the financial corruption in plain sight today in our banking and investment world, and their incestuous relationship with Washington -- which is bailing them out with trillions of taxpayer dollars -- it is clear that the oligarchy thinks it can screw the "little people" with impunity. In the sexual realm, there may be no difference, and the film depicts this. People are just pieces of meat, to be used for whatever whim these super-rich elites should desire. I suspect there is more truth to this aspect of Eyes Wide Shut than we would like to believe.The second time I watched Eyes Wide Shut, I concentrated more on its theme of fidelity, jealousy, interactions within a marriage relationship, and of course the "adventure" Tom Cruise's character has as a result. What is the message here? There is something to be said for the safety and stability of home, though fantasies do intrude and can lead to danger, even destruction.The concept of the film, to address these issues, was probably a reasonable goal. However, for all the labor expended on crafting this film, all the little details that the film buffs and movie historians will obsess over, all the craft involved in filming and editing, the movie is ultimately a flop.Why?The dialog is laughably bad at times. Cruise's and even Kidman's acting seems incredibly phony. The overall plot probably would have served as the framework for a good movie, had the script and the performances not been so awful. Even the erotic scenes are not titillating, because of the revolting and bizarre atmosphere in which they are contextualized.Perhaps worst of all, the couple at the center of this story are not interesting people. Cruise does not in any way appear or act intelligent enough to make a credible physician in this role, not just because he's a pretty boy, but he simply doesn't have the bearing of a professional man. And why should we care about these people, seemingly sleepwalking through their pampered and conventional lives? Yes, the troubling things that the good doctor gets himself mixed up in give us a sense that he has confronted evil, and we do root for him on that basis. But at the end of the film, we almost do not care whether this couple stays together or breaks up.The movie is pretty to look at, at times, with low-contrast naturally-lit interiors. The "orgy party" scenes are a bit more stark -- with the pseudo-cultic circle of people in robes and masks in their ceremonial rites. However, there is nothing mind-blowing like 2001 or the battle scenes in Full Metal Jacket.It's hard to recommend this movie. For all its apparent intentions to tell a good story and comment on relationships and society, it feels to me like a dud. Perhaps like me, you will have to watch it twice to convince yourself of that, but frankly I think it would be a waste of time.

Seriously. Charlie Chaplin was more sophisticated than The Hangover.Lame. Un-funny. This movie is the equivalent a child with a booger on the end of his finger sticking it out at you and expecting you to laugh. Funny to him, not to me.In addition, this film is proof Roger Ebert can no longer be trusted. The blurb on the back of the box quotes Ebert as rating this three and a half stars, with this assessment: "Now this is what I'm talkin' about. A funny movie, flat out, all the way through."There's nothing wrong with dumbness and wackiness. Laurel and Hardy. I rest my case. But that was inspired dumbness. Seinfeld was inspired wackiness. This is recycled, clumsy, cheap, easy, obvious dumbness. Seinfeld without the inspiration.

"Epic masterpiece..." "Channeling John Lennon" These are descriptions from other reviews, both puzzling to me. There's nothing epic about this, nor is there the slightest resemblance to Mr. Lennon -- who composed music in an entirely different vein. This is a personal album, sometimes quiet and sometimes hypnotically beat-driven. As far as I can tell GLP played and sang everything himself. This is like his earlier Ladies Love Oracle, but juiced up with rhythm. Acoustic guitars and electric keyboards predominate, with the synthetic percussion.Mobilize doesn't really hang together as a unified piece. It is more a collection of songs, most of which are very good. The best of them are dreamy, entrancing, and soothing. Computer-sequenced beats give a pulse to many of the tracks. The lyrics are specific enough to be enticing but vague enough to allow your own interpretation. Was See America Grant-Lee's twist on Simon & Garfunkel's "...all come to look for America"? It seems so to me, and I think it is equally clever and anthemic.See America, Sleepless Lake, and April Chimes showcase Phillips' ability to write a haunting melody, which is something of a lost art. See his Ladies Love Oracle CD for more of the same.The title track, is probably the least enjoyable tune on the album. It sounds a bit off-kilter, with its minor chords and allusions to war. The other tracks are much less depressing. Spring Released is positively bouyant, as is Beautiful Dreamers. (My grandmother used to play the classic old song Beautiful Dreamer, which GLP deftly incorporates into his own new composition.)GLP is not trying to push the envelope or pump you up or sermonize. He seeks to entertain, by presenting a little piece of his contempative romantic soul. Treat yourself to some high class pop. Get this album. You can catch glimpses of GLP as the "town troubadour" on the first season of Gilmore Girls, too. That's how I was first introduced to his music.I lost my first copy of this CD. I can't imagine how. It never left the house. But I had to buy another, because I knew I would miss it. I think you might feel that way about it, too.

This album was originally recorded one night in a recording studio, direct-to-disk. The audio feed went directly to a lathe that cut a lacquer disc used to make a vinyl album. No editing, no tape. Each album side had to be cut in a single take. This puts more pressure on the performers than a normal recording date, where a song can be recorded numerous times and the best take used, and even edited for length or mistakes.These are top-level jazz players, up for the challenge. Joe Sample plays traditional jazz tunes, away from his normal solo album fare and his work with the Crusaders. Reliable bass duties are handled by Ray Brown, and Shelly Manne is behind the drum kit. All the participants are bandleaders in their own right.The first take of each of the two vinyl sides (the first six tracks on this reissue CD) was released as a direct-to-disc record in 1976 on the East Wind label. When the stampers for the first takes were worn out, they released the second takes -- the same songs, same sequence, but a different performance -- on the same label with the same title and album cover. Those second takes comprise tracks 7-12 on this CD.The source for this CD is a backup tape recorded at the same time as the direct-to-disc lacquer was cut. Picky audiophiles may notice an odd low-level distortion intermittently in the right channel. At worst it is a minor distraction, caused by some problem in the line feed to the tape machine, or possibly by deterioration of the master tape. But it is there, and it is not heard on the direct-to-disc vinyl sides (I own the "take 2" release of this album), so I felt I should mention it.There's no way a tape can match the purity, clarity, and dynamics of the original vinyl releases. I bought a copy of this CD to avoid having to manually transfer my vinyl copy to a digital format. If you buy this, it will be for the performances, not for the stellar sound quality, which is a bit less than stellar on the CD release.You get two complete performances of the album -- take one and take two. You can definitely hear the adrenalin in the first six tracks. Those performances are more superficially exciting, a bit more dynamic, but to my ears they seem a little less controlled. Once they settled down for the second take, their solos became a bit more thoughtful and relaxed. I enjoyed both versions, but if I had to live with only one set, it would be take 2 (tracks 7-12).This is traditional jazz, played by three musicians of worldwide recording fame. You should know what to expect. No new trails are blazed here. The tunes are standard jazz fare. The solos and variations are generally melodic -- interesting, easy to digest, but not exactly transcendent. I find Ray Brown's solos the least interesting of the three. He's a little too busy. Maybe that's a matter of taste. He's no Ron Carter, let's put it that way.This album is like being a fly on the wall in the studio that night. You hear exactly what was played, for better or for worse. And mostly, it's for the better.

I've heard about 10 or 12 Leo Kottke albums, and this is the best of all of them. I like some of his odd vocals, and none of those appear here, but this is still a great album because the songs and arrangements are better than what you'll find on the average Kottke release. Everything clicked on this recording. Part of what makes this program so appealing is the variety of styles. It keeps the listener from getting bored. There are some slow bluesy numbers (Late Zone) with thoughtful sentimental melodies (Ojo) to break up the frenetic fingerpicking of Taxco Steps and others.Honestly, I find some of Leo Kottke's work pretty tuneless and pointless, but almost everything here is very good to excellent. If you like Leo's style of solo guitar, the songs on Chuck Pink are the best examples you will find.

This album is completely different from the "chamber jazz" treatment that the Morelenbaums and Ryuichi Sakamoto gave Tom Jobim's work on Casa. I thought Paula's voice was almost angelically lovely on that album, and so took a chance on this one.All the songs here were written or co-written by Vinicius de Moraes. The comparison to Bebel Gilberto's first big album is natural, but not wholly accurate. Paula's clean pure voice and natural inflections are still here, and you'll find the nylon stringed guitars that almost define the classic bossa nova sound. Add to this loops, beats, synths, and you have samba, bossa nova, with a healthy dash of William Orbit and late-period Everything But The Girl.Almost everything here is above average. There aren't any real klunkers, though honestly I could do without some of the spoken word intrusions that sound like samples of the ghost of Tom Jobim reciting something I naturally cannot understand as a non-Portugese speaker. Insensatez is weirded up a little more than I would have done it, but I can't say it isn't fresh and original. And on its own terms, it works, even though it isn't my favorite way to hear this classic song.I guess to sum up, I would say this album was a pleasant surprise, with the emphasis on pleasant. It is tuneful, mostly upbeat, innovative, it doesn't really drag anywhere, and you can tap your toe to it. Highly recommended, unless you're a purist.

The Partyball album was a tough act for Ridgway to follow. It was his most successful record to date, artistically and commercially. Since no good deed goes unpunished, Stan was then dropped from his record label.Black Diamond has its merits, but in no way does it live up to its predecessor. Not even close.The beginning is very promising. Big Dumb Town is classic Ridgway, catchy and obscure at the same time. The second cut is a shocker. With unadorned vocals and guitar, in Gone the Distance Stan does an eerie impression of Neil Young's prettier acoustic work.With Knife and Fork, we're back in Stan-land, a song that is creepy, slinky, and kinky. The sparse production and strange sound effects work well.From here on, the album suffers a bit from underproduction. Down the Coast Highway meanders sadly through four verses and then ends abruptly. This kind of thing might work for a movie soundtrack, but I don't think it stands on its own.Luther Played Guitar is a sentimental tribute to the early days of Johnny Cash, but it is an average country tune -- it doesn't reveal anything special about Stan or Johnny.Stranded is a very good song -- more sophisticated lyrically and musically than much of Ridgway's recent output. It sounds like a demo tape though. Stan's vocals on the chorus are strained just when he needs to back off and soften up for the sake of the heartbreaking lyric. With some creative arrangements, this song could have been one of Stan's best. As it is, it is hard for me to listen to.Wild Bill Donovan finds Stan sounding like the early acoustic harmonica-playin' Bob Dylan. That style complements this story about the famed founder of the OSS, which carried out espionage and sabotage in Europe and Asia during WWII. Stan also competently covers a Bob Dylan song, As I Went Out This Morning (from the John Wesley Harding album), toward the end of Black Diamond. It might even be better than Dylan's version.Man of Stone is another fine song that ends up coming off like a demo tape. The rhythm box never varies throughout the tune, and apparently no one wanted to pay for a real brass section to replace the slightly cheesy synthesizer parts and the faux trumpet solo. The song itself reminds me of the sonically exciting masterpiece Gumbo Man from Partyball, but the impact is blunted because the arrangement does not allow any musical tension to build up and release.Pink Parakeet is similar -- the rhythm box is on autopilot and so is the rest of the performance.I don't know how to say this, but the vocals on Underneath the Green Tree are just amateurish. Crystal Palace is even more embarrassing. I can speculate that he was drunk when he recorded it, but in the sober light of day, this tape should have been erased.In terms of style, Ridgway is all over the map on Black Diamond. I'm not sure that the country and folk flavor of songs like Wild Bill, Luther Played Guitar, and Gone the Distance merge well with synthesizer-dominated tracks like Big Dumb Town, Knife and Fork, and Stranded. The album is more a collection of tunes than a concept. Still, the songs are good, and the main problem is that not enough care was lavished on bringing those songs to musical fruition through careful arranging, recording, and production.I may be fussy and demanding about performances and arrangements, but those two issues constitute half of the ability to communicate musically. I see many of these songs as wasted opportunities.

Rickie Lee covers everything from Gershwin to Hoagy Carmichaelto Steely Dan. I think the highlight of the album is The Beatles' For No One. When Paul McCartney sang it, it was another pretty tune. When Rickie Lee sings it, it's full of the sadness it was meant to have.Show Biz Kids is another successful adaptation, accomplished with the help of Joe Jackson on keyboards and vocals. Steely Dan should be honored.Many of the others are just good to fair. It's so subjective. How can Rickie move me so much on For No One and yet totally fail to hold my interest on I Can't Get Started? But this is my reaction.At $3-4 for a used copy, it is worthwhile for a few inspiring cuts here. At $15? No can do.

I have used about 5 of these 12A1970 cartridges. I don't do a lot of printing, therefore the ink tends to degrade over time somehow. I have not tried the cold water method suggested by some, but I will remember it.2 or 3 of the cartridges I bought did not not even last the normal number of sheets printed before the print started getting so bad it was unusable. I think Lexmark has designed the ink to be bad, or the printheads to be unreliable, so that customers are forced to buy new cartridges regularly, even if they don't print a lot of pages.Never again will I buy a Lexmark printer. If the cartridges were $5 or $10, you could easily put up with these problems. But at $25-30, this level of performance is inexcusably bad. Boo hiss.

As for praise, I can't add anything to the many compliments given by others for every aspect of this production. Simply amazing.I simply had to add a comment about picture quality, which one review complained was not as good as a copy of the original VHS tapes. I've seen the VHS tape version. This DVD release surely is no worse. The source material was perhaps softened a bit too much to lessen video noise on the original. In other words, the focus looks a bit soft. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with the picture quality.I've seen other video material from this era transferred to DVD, and this is about the best that can be expected. We watched the entire series on DVD with no complaints. I was very happy. You will be too, as you are drawn into this story, brought alive with consummate skill and passion.

Big budget. Big stars. Big bomb. And I don't mean the exploding kind, though there are plenty of explosions and firefights and a literal bombing or two.I have enjoyed many John Cusack movies. I thought his recent The Martian Child was very good. The producers were hoping in War Inc. to up the ante on Grosse Pointe Blank, with a higher body count and a higher level of mercenary insanity. Unfortunately lightning rarely strikes twice.There are several reasons the movie fails, and I can't list them all. First, the movie tries too hard to be clever -- it brims over with absurdities that are supposed to be amusing. But the emphasis seems to be on making an over-the-top political statement about USA's military-industrial complex (comparing it to the killer-for-hire business in Grosse Pointe), and the personal conflict of Cusack's character in War Inc seems less integral to the plot. It doesn't reach us on the same personal level, either in the comedy or the romance, that it did in Grosse Pointe.This movie might be very well-received in countries with the lowest opinion of American military power and foreign policy. It might also find a sympathetic audience among those in this country who view our corporations and hawkish politicians as evil killers. But the dialog isn't sharp enough, the skewering doesn't have enough resonance, to make this a great movie, or even a good one.What separates a black comedy like this from a classic like Dr. Strangelove? Sharper writing, better performances, and subtlety. War Inc. is about as subtle as its pop icon Yonica's hip-gyrating "I want to blow you... UP!" musical performance. This movie is as subtle as a train wreck. Better luck next time, Cusack & Cusack.

I saw Steve Goodman in concert only once, opening for John Prine, a few years before his death, I believe. That experience and this album leads me to believe that his live performances had an additional level of energy that probably wasn't captured fully in his studio recordings.Suffice it to say that this album is full of enjoyable folk music moments. Particularly when Goodman's humor is on display in his wild scenarios like the Three Legged Man. On the other hand, his version of The Water Is Wide here is spot on target, and heartbreaking. The man could do it all.This collection is kind of a mish-mash. Some live recordings, some not. There's no unifying theme, just a bunch of good songs. I take one star off for uneven and sometimes quite poor recording quality. Still, it is an excellent collection, and the price isn't too steep. Man, if you can't enjoy this then you are seriously depressed. Get some Prozac, quick!

Tusk was a bit of a mess. Coming after two tight, hit-filled classic albums (Fleetwood Mac and Rumours), the band lost their focus on Tusk. They spent months and months and endless effort in the studio, but the final result still sounds half-baked and not quite finished in many spots.There is probably an album's worth of good material on Tusk. The bad news first: Lindsey Buckingham's glorified demo tracks fill about half of disc one. Virtually all of them are forgettable ditties on a level with McCartney's Why Don't We Do It In The Road and Ringo's Don't Pass Me By on the White Album. In other words, they are not really necessary.Also unnecessary is the entire second disc of demos and rough studio takes. Sorry, but there just isn't anything interesting here. Disc 2 was apparently added to justify bumping up the list price. No reason to give Fleetwood Mac fans a break, right? After they already purchased the original album on vinyl or cassette, and then shelled out for the first CD release, let's nick 'em again for the remaster. And while we're at it, let's double the price by adding some dodgy old outtakes! Call me cynical, but this is just a grab for cash by the band, or the record label, or both.To be fair, there are still some great tunes by Nicks -- spooky and mysterious as ever here. Christine McVie does not fail to produce some of the sweetest melodic songs about romance ever written. Never Make Me Cry is the shortest and sweetest of them all. Apparently it was released as a single, but radio never fell in love with it as I have.Tusk, the song, is lunacy, but inspired lunacy. The dense orchestration is revealed better than ever by the improved sound of this new set.The remastering job is great. Rhino was involved, and they know their stuff. So, if you want the best sound, you'll have to pony up the big bucks for this 2-disc set, or try to find it used at a more reasonable cost.

The Roches are unclassifiable. But they do project a self-image of nerdishness, not unlike Weird Al Yankovic. Their songs are not strictly comedic, however.Nurds is a very eclectic album. Factory Girl is like an old folk ballad from the old country. There are quite a few "relationship" songs. The instrumentation is generally sparse. The Roches have a distinct style of vocal arranging, which I wish I could adequately describe. They never attempt to sound especially "pretty," let's put it that way. At times they are given to deliberate dissonance (One Season) or just off-the-wall vocal noises (Nurds).I thought the songs on their first, self-titled album were higher quality and easier to take. However, many people might prefer Nurds, with its higher level of experimentation. I don't. Nurds (the song) is a fun self-deprecating romp, though.Listen before you buy, if you can.

This album has been one of my favorites, especially the first five songs, which would be side one of the original vinyl release. I think the energy sags just a bit in the second half, but there aren't any clunkers here. You know what to expect from Michael Franks in terms of smooth jazzy songs and sly wordplay. One Bad Habit is Michael near the top of his game.My biggest disappointment with the CD is that either a substandard master tape was used for remastering, or else the masters have softened up over the years, or the mastering was just careless -- the sound just doesn't have the clarity and punch of the original vinyl, mastered by Doug Sax at the Mastering Lab, if my recollection is correct.This isn't a major problem. The sound is good, but I thought it should have been more exciting. If you can find a clean vinyl copy, it might actually be a better purchase, if your turntable is good enough to retrieve the extra information from the grooves.

Up front, I will take this over late-period Bob Dylan any day. The lyrics here are much more poetic and playful than the cut-and-paste jobs Dylan has forced us to endure in his latest, Modern Times.Lightfoot's melodies and hooks are strong, his singing is strong, the song structure is solid. What is a little off-putting at times is his apparent attempt to remain radio-friendly in the 1980s by adopting the common synthesized drums and synthesizers common to the era. Anything For Love, co-written and produced by David Foster, is the worst example of this tendency. Apart from that fiasco, I find these songs hold up on repeated listening, even though this particular style of pop music sounds especially dated.If East of Midnight had been produced in the style of Dream Street Rose or Sundown, it would be hailed as one of Gord's masterpieces. In spite of its admitted flaws, this is an album to which I can return repeatedly for enjoyment. For his next record, he returned to the more standard "Lightfoot sound" but the songs weren't as strong. I can't give it five stars, but it is worth owning unless you absolutely detest the obvious use of synthesizers and programmed rhythm tracks.

The Rhino remastering job is excellent.You've already heard three or four of these songs on the radio, probably. For me, it is harder to describe what makes an album great than it is for me to describe the faults in an album that doesn't measure up. And I can find little to fault here. A couple of the songs on side 2 (thinking back to the vinyl LP days) are a bit less accomplished, but still highly listenable. The bonus demo tracks at the end are interesting, but not essential.Rhymin' Paul Simon did a much more intricate production on this album than on his first solo (eponymously titled) record following the split with Garfunkel. Here he expands from that earlier folk base to add elements of gospel, jazz, lush orchestral arrangements, a bit of dixieland on the Mardi Gras tune, and all but the kitchen sink. Paul Simon's singing is unleashed on this record too, compared with the straightlaced stuff he did with Simon and Garmfunkel. It sounds very spontaneous, and yet perfectly executed at the same time. I find the variety of instrumentation, the different beats, the continuous innovation, the changing parts and rhythms within a song -- all of it is very entrancing. There's hardly a dull moment. Even St. Judy's Comet, a kind of lullaby for his son, is sincere and on target, instantly loveable.The songs are short, so they don't wear out their welcome. The original album was less than 40 minutes. Hey, do you want quality or just quantity? I think movies and pop songs are both too self-indulgently long nowadays.Simon was in the zone when he wrote and recorded Rhymin'. Most artists would be satisfied for one timeless classic like American Tune on a record. But Loves Me Like A Rock is just as timeless, and so is Something So Right, for my money. The other tunes are not embarrassed in the company of such greatness, either. That's saying a lot.

This was the auspicious debut of Paul Simon's post-Garfunkel solo career. It is probably more ecclectic and quirky than the S&G; classic stuff. It also tends toward sparse, instrumentally minimal backup for Paul's singing. In subsequent Paul Simon albums, a full band for accompaniment was generally the rule.The appeal of this record is Paul just basically singing and playing his little heart out. Of course, this would be pointless except that the songs are great. Where are the singer-songwriters of the current generation who can equal Paul Simon in his prime? The only one I see on the horizon is Feist.Paul Simon is not a romantic. At least not here. Most of the songs are written from a bit of a slant. A jaundiced eye, shall we say. Therein lies the cleverness that makes the album interesting. But writing about music is like dancing about sculpture. It is hard to say anything really useful. Either you like this kind of music, or you like Doris Day. I choose Paul Simon.Remastering is supposed to work wonders with the sound, and sometimes Rhino really does. The YES Album, for example, and the Emerson Lake & Palmer catalog. Those are also recordings from the same era as Paul Simon, and to my ears they sound fantastic, better than many records put out in the last two years.I have the vinyl edition of Paul Simon/Paul Simon, from his box set. Honestly, it has problems -- spitty sibilants, mainly -- probably due to a less-than-perfect pressing, or maybe my phono cartridge azimuth is off, or not enough tracking pressure. But apart from that, the sound has an immediacy and body that is absent from the remastered CD, and no one could be sadder about that than myself. On the vinyl, there is detail and dynamics and timbre that somehow got lost on the way to this Rhino analog-to-digital conversion. Did they lose the master tape for the first five songs? Somehow those sound worse than the rest - like a copy of a copy. The guitars sound like dime store models, and the wood block sounds like it's made out of plastic.So what do you get for your 15 bucks? Great songs, a cheap digipac container (at least there is a lyrics/credits booklet) for the CD, and mediocre sound. Eh, I'm not impressed. I think they coulda shoulda done better.The bonus demo versions of Me And Julio and the Paranoia Blues are nice, but not essential. Really, they transcend demo status to be equally valid interpretations.

Steely Dan performs, with limited backup -- Steely Dan unplugged is what this is -- a few of their classic songs, along with some jazz classics. The best part of this album is the jazz music.The Dan are not annoyed with Ms. McPartland at all. They are in awe! This grand old lady of jazz was there when the classic era of be-bop jazz was happening. She met the legends that Walter and Donald idolize -- Charlie Parker, the Duke, Louis Armstrong.Yes, there is a bit of awkwardness as these musicians from different genres and clearly different generations try to connect. But I've listened to this show several times and I can only see the utmost mutual respect between all involved. McPartland is out of her element trying to jam with The Dan. Donald and Walter do not exactly shine as jazz players, either. Walter Becker is clearly not suited to playing Duke Ellington -- he is the most like a fish out of water. But it's all in good fun.My advice is for Steely Dan fans who are not otherwise into jazz music pass on this disc. For those of us who have extensive pop and jazz collections, this show is very enjoyable. That said, the best musical performance is McPartland's moving solo performance of Star Eyes (requested by Donald Fagen). The second best is Hesitation Blues. Limbo Jazz is kind of a hoot, too. Steely Dan can't lose when they play the blues -- many, many of their songs are based on the classic blues structure, twisted, bent, and run through the Cuisineart. But it still boils down to the blues and jazz.It was a truly special hour with McPartland and The Dan. Yes, it gives me warm fuzzies. Still, it might not be your cup of tea, so be advised.

If your view of fundamentalist/evangelical Christians coincides with the stereotypical bigoted views of the film's writers, you may think this film hits home big time.The one valid point the film makes, that moralistic Christians should be forgiving of others' moral shortcomings -- because we all have large shortcomings -- is muddled because, in the end, the film's point of view is that pre-marital sex, adultery, homosexuality, are just part of the wonderful variety of God's creation, not moral failings at all.But if you enjoy watching Evangelical Christians -- who believe that the Bible offers us clear statements about moral rights and wrongs -- take jibe after jibe, groin kick after groin kick, this is the perfect diversion for your evening. The character of Hillary Faye is the "straw man" set up to represent all judgmental, hypocritical, unloving Christians, who get their just desserts in the end. And after all, aren't all Bible-believing Christians judgmental, hypocritical, and unloving? So it would seem. Sad that the authors never got to know the real subjects of their ridicule.The writers of this film wield satire as a blunt weapon. If they intend to score any valid points against fundamentalists, they'll have to be cleverer than this.

There is no great theme here, and stylistically these songs vary all over the map, from distorted guitars to modernized madrigals about ancient Greek legends to quiet instrumentals. Still, almost all the compositions are top notch, equivalent to the stuff on Al's hit album Year Of The Cat.Many of the cuts attempt the complex layered orchestral production that Alan Parsons gave to Year Of The Cat and Time Passages. However, on Last Days Of The Century, the violins are synthesized. Sonically, the sound has a brittle etched quality that is consistent with early digital recording techniques. I suppose the word for it is "tinny." This tinny character affects everything from vocals to keyboards to percussion. This is a little irritating to someone like myself who loves the smooth organic wholeness of a good analog recording, but the songs are so good, it becomes a minor factor.Al writes intelligently and movingly about Josephine Baker, the longing of lovers, the conquest of the South Pole, and lawyers. Al hates lawyers. Listen to License To Steal, and I think you'll get the picture. But whatever his choice of theme, Al writes in a literate, amusing way that speaks of great song craftsmanship.This is one of my favorite Al Stewart albums and one of my top 50 favorite albums of any artist or genre. With the sythesizers and the tinny-sounding cymbals and guitars, the *sound* of the album is clearly dated. Still, the music is timeless, even in these first days of a new century.

I'm a little disturbed by people who say they are liberal, and most definitely not a member of the "religious right" (Oh! Horrors! Not one of THOSE people!), who say they like the show. It makes me wonder if I missed something -- am I wrong to like this show?If "religious right" means believing in the laws of the Bible, then I am a member. But a good TV show is a good TV show, regardless. One cannot expect something produced in Hollywood for a mass audience to cater to every doctrinal belief or whim of conservative Christians. I could quibble with the details, the allusions, the "new age-y" aspects of Joan of Arcadia (JoA), but in important respects it gets many things about God right.Beyond that, it is simply one of the best-written and -acted shows on TV. At least the first season is without compare. There was a falloff in consistency and a confusion of direction in the second season, but I can recommend season one with a whole heart.Oh, let me quibble about one thing. It is amazing how Amber Tamblyn can cry with seeming genuine-ness and zero effort. She's apparently a natural and gifted actress. In spite of the fact that she doesn't look like a Kate Moss anorexic model-type, I hope she has a long career in all sorts of movie and TV projects. But does she have to burst into tears in EVERY DANGED SHOW? That's a bit much.Teh supporting cast is great, and the fact that Joan's brother (who is played by a teen) has the hots for a classmate who is played by a woman of 29 is of endless amusement, and amazement, to me. Talk about robbing the cradle.The drama is gripping, the human conflict is real and convincingly painful, and this team pulled off 22 shows that stand up to repeated viewing without the quality flagging. Truly a five-star effort. How could I not buy this?

The songwriting thing doesn't seem to have been going so well for Sting lately. After Ten Summoner's Tales, the quality and quantity of his output seemed to sag. Perhaps this is at least partly the reason Sting decided to do a "covers" album.Sting is a great performer with his own top notch material. That would be natural. Here, he often sounds out of his element. He can't sing these songs like a classical singer, and he really shouldn't try, because the results can be dull as all get out (e.g. the final song). I don't know what he could do to jazz these songs up to suit his personal style. The Freddy Mercury-style overdubbed choir on the first tune is probably an attempt at this, and it succeeds, at least partly.It's hard to ruin Fine Knacks For Ladies, and Sting seems to have fun with the song. At other times, I think he's too reverent toward the material.The instrumentals Fantasy and The Battle Galliard are quite beautiful.The little spoken-word interludes are recorded so close-up that when you listen on headphones, it sounds like Sting is whispering in your ear. Slightly creepy for me. Maybe the ladies would enjoy that sensation.A handful of tunes here are reasonably good. I'm sorry to say that most of the songs fail to really get off the ground. I can't condemn the album, but it would be hard for me to recommend it. If it is John Dowland songs you want, there are albums that present those songs in a more appropriate and entertaining light. If it is Sting you want, he's here, but there are much better albums by Sting that probably merit more of your time.

Fred Astaire was at his peak. You could not ask for better musicians supporting him. The songs were classic. Astaire delivers these songs in an intimate setting with a small jazz band -- such as you'd hear at a small jazz club. All the musicians, including Astaire, sound like they were having the time of their lives -- each playing off the others' artistry. This recording captures a moment in time when events coalesced to make the conditions for a perfect recording. &quot;Heaven, I'm in heaven...&quot; That pretty much says it all. This set is a classic for the ages.

The strong material here is very strong. The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald is possibly one of the ten best narrative songs written in the last century. Other good cuts are the title track, I'm Not Supposed to Care, I'll Do It Again, and Race Among the Ruins. The other tracks may or may not appeal, depending on your taste. I found them musically rather ordinary. Maybe I sense a lack of energy in the vocals on half of Summertime Dream, especially compared to Sundown, which I thought was thoroughly riveting throughout.As a whole, I didn't think it was as consistently good as Don Quixote or Sundown. Those albums have a higher replay value.

I found this book in the basement, and am getting near the finish now. Clarke may be better at writing non-fiction than fiction. I am thoroughly enjoying it.Treasure of the Great Reef is an account of the excavation of a sunken treasure ship found on the Great Basses reefs on the south coast of Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon). There were cannon and other artifacts, but mostly silver. It was discovered by Clarke's diving partner and co-author, Mike Wilson, quite accidentally during a pleasure dive Mike was taking with the two sons of one of Mike's friends.This is a fun true-life adventure, and while there is nothing so fantastic in it as Pirates of the Carribbean or 2001, life is sometimes stranger than fiction. Clarke himself was unable to do much of the excavation work, being quite weak from a neurological injury -- some doctors thought polio, and some thought head trauma. The expedition was financed by... this is crazy... filming a hit adventure movie, the first Technicolor feature film ever made in Ceylon for the Ceylonese.This book is highly readable, interesting, informative. It certainly beats 95% of the fluff that passes for fiction. If you like entertaining writing about true life adventures, this is a promising possibility. If you already like Arthur Clarke's science fiction, it is a no-brainer, because this book is better. It is informative and light-hearted. A very pleasurable diversion.

These songs mostly set up a very pleasant groove, but it is hard to find anything really interesting happening here. This music seems to be more about texture than any memorable melody. That's not to say it isn't harmonious and melodic -- it is. It just doesn't have much pizzazz.I thought Sting's work was disappointing. He seemed to be trying to imitate Sinatra, snapping his fingers and crooning on one verse of his own tune Moon Over Bourbon Street, and growling as a gravelly voiced bluesman on another verse. Sting, you're no Sinatra. You're no Blind Melon Chitlin. Just be yourself. I don't think Sting put much thought into The Wee Small Hours, either. Compare it with Someone to Watch Over Me (from the movie of the same title) and 'Round Midnight (on Andy Summers' Green Chimneys CD) -- both honorable efforts by Sting to cover some classic older tunes -- and you'll see what I mean.Shawn Colvin's appearance was more successful, especially her own composition Facts About Jimmy. Can't go wrong with Shawn.I love Botti's cute little red-haired drummer. She put on a good show and played a fun solo.The guitarist played a lot of chunka-chunka muted strings and wah-wah -- more of a third percusionist in the band. His solos seemed like a succession of distorted chords. I didn't think it really fit with this band. Maybe a Russell Malone-type of player would have been more appropriate.I can't really hate this video, but I can't really love it, either. At least it goes down like "buttah". But it is the musical equivalent of a Chinese meal. It doesn't bring much lasting satiety.

I really wanted to like this album. I own the original Return to Forever album in two formats. The playing here is very energetic. It isn't unpleasant to listen to (once). Most of the songs have a good groove. However, these songs generally lack the lyrical quality of the first RtF album. Times Lie and Bass Folk Song in particular start out with a nice lyrical theme, but when the blowing starts, it begins to sound like a show-off competition. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I like improvisation that is more closely related to the theme and a little more thoughtful, rather than an exercize in mere technique and power and speed.This is "far out" moon music, if that's what you like. I personally find it hard to relate to. Perhaps they should have confined themselves to the standard jazz repertoire.Oh, I should mention that the recording seems very good, and I only heard one reed squeak, which was a major complaint of another reviewer who must have his eardrums tuned to the resonant frequency of out-of-control reeds. It simply is not a problem. The drum solos and accompaniment are also nicely separated, often in the right channel, for full enjoyment.

I'm at a bit of a loss on this one. I'm familiar with most of the output of Pete Townshend and The Who since their Who's Next album. I don't recall ever hearing the original Who Sell Out. I can only give my reaction to this Petra Haden recreation without the benefit of knowing the original songs.It sounds typical to me of an attempt by a young choir to put pop/rock tunes into a choral context. It's really a mismatch of interpretational style and underlying material, in my opinion. Like playing the Star Spangled Banner on electric guitar. It's amusing for a couple of minutes. But can you imagine Brian May (Queen guitarist) doing an entire album of Sousa marches all arranged as an overdubbed choir of overdriven guitars? Of course, if your tastes are extremely open-minded musically, maybe you'd go for that sort of thing.And I'm not really sure why Petra Haden considered these songs worthy of three years of effort to recreate them in this way. I wonder if the time spent might have been more rewarding by focusing on truly great songs in the American popular songbook.Like some old coot who builds a whole city of model buildings in his yard using only old pop bottles, the craftsmanship and determination Petra Haden invested in creating this album is impressive. In the end, though, the listener is left to wonder what the point was, exactly. It's got a beat. It has vocal pyrotechnics and tricky harmonies that I'm sure were difficult to record as a one-woman band. But a whole album of this is way too much of a great thing.So four stars for talent and effort and originality. But I hope no one will make me listen to this again.

The sound quality is not the best, but for a live recording of that era, it might be as good or better than average. It isn't a large band, and all the instruments are clearly audible. The dynamics are a bit constrained, but nothing like the over-compressed pop music being released nowadays.The music outweighs any concerns about sound quality. This is an incredible band. Metheny, Mays, Pastorius, Alias, Brecker -- how can one find complaint with this backup??? On Dry Cleaner From Des Moines, Michael Brecker tears up the stage! And Jaco drives the song with machine gun bass lines. Metheny has an beautifully lyrical solo that is a segue from a movingly rendered Amelia. In France They Kiss On Main Street and Free Man In Paris move along with a life they never had on the original album.True, there are some somber, slower, fussy jazz tunes here like Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and Furry Sings the Blues, but all in all this is an infectious and exciting event. I own the DVD, and bought the album twice, first on LP and now on CD. It's a must-have in the Joni catalog, and it brings repeated joy.It's true that if you like the purer, folkie side of Joni Mitchell, you might not enjoy this live album as much as the studio albums. If you're not into jazz, you might be bored or annoyed. But I like Joni's jazz period, and this is the best band she could have to bring those songs to a live audience. The performances of most of the songs on Shadows And Light outshine the original studio productions.

The new album "The Reminder" by Canadian gal Leslie Feist is receiving mixed critical reviews, but some are calling it the best pop music album so far this year. I ordered it, and my take on it is also mixed, in this sense: Feist is a great songwriter, and this album is exhibit one. Not all of the songs are great, but many of them achieve greatness. Feist's previous album also contained great songs (and some less compelling material), but only about half of them were Feist originals. Here, almost everything is Feist-penned.Remember the "1234" Busby Berkely-inspired video of Feist from Youtube, that people seemed to enjoy so much? If you haven't seen it, check it out -- it is pure joy wrapped in a 3 minute package. That song is also a minor musical masterpiece, with guitar, banjo, a chorus of voices, quiet bits, loud joyful bits -- put together in a way that things are always changing enough to keep the ear from being bored at any time.When I think of the Beatles work, or XTC, or James Taylor, Sting, Paul Simon, I think of music that is put together in a very entertaining and craftsmanlike way. A primitive like Bob Dylan (don't get me wrong, I love a lot of what Bob has done, but it is musically primitive) will take a simple three chord verse, then repeat it over and over with different lyrics. The greatest songwriters make music that builds, crescendos, then rolls back, with themes and variations, and little musical bridges (or "middle eights," as the Beatles used to call them). Feist is writing music like that, at least some of the time.Oh, there are a few quieter numbers that almost approach dirges. I'm not much fond of those. Much of their fault lies in the underproduction -- one of them sounds as if it was recorded in Feist's garden, with her simply strumming her guitar and singing (later joined briefly by brass instruments and perhaps saxophone, but not much else). More complexity and attention to detail in the arrangements could have brought much more out of those quiet songs.I'm not a great analyser of lyrics. Here they are vague enough to be universal. To me they don't always make sense, but that doesn't bother me. "goo goo ga joob" Does that make any sense? No. It doesn't mean it isn't a great lyric. The main thing is that Feist's lyrics are not embarrassing -- they don't take away from the music. And some of her wordplay and vocal phrasing is quite clever.So my final rating isSongwriting: 4.5 out of 5Production: varies from 3 to 5 out of 5, depending on the track.

Al Stewart (had a big radio hit with the song Year of the Cat) said recently that he still has a great fondness for &quot;jangle-y bands&quot; -- guitar-based good time pop music that rocks, but not too hard. What the Bangles have produced on Doll Revolution is a classic of the jangle-y genre.When a band takes a break of over a decade and then re-forms for a new project, there is always justifiable worry that the old magic can't be captured again. The Bangles proved an exception to the rule by producing the strongest work of their career on this long-awaited new album. Granted, not every tune on Doll Revolution is a solid gold gem, but there are at least ten well-turned songs on this record, which is about the most anyone can reasonably ask.If you liked the old Bangles, there is no reason you shouldn't be happy with the new Bangles. They can still rock, and sing beautifully produced and sincere love songs. If anything, their harmonies are sweeter and more perfect than ever. The recording does not have state-of-the-art clarity, which is a bit of a disappointment, but the fidelity is at least equivalent to their previous records from the eighties.There is one sour note, not in the music, but in the fact that if you want the lyrics, you won't get them in the booklet. They are found only on the limited edition DVD version -- on the DVD. So you are supposed to run to your DVD player every time you want to check out the song lyrics? Not cool.The Bangles have shown that you *can* go home again. They recorded this album on their own terms, took their time, and carefully crafted something they could be proud of. And they should be proud. This is good stuff. It isn't revolutionary, despite the title. They sing of love, loss, confusion, frustration, and loneliness. They make it rhyme, and they make us tap our feet and smile. I can't ask for more than that.

People are saying these are fine performances. They are probably right, but I'd never know. You can't really hear them, for all the noise and singing along from the crowd.Personally, when I go to a concert, I do not pay to hear other people shouting and singing. The same goes for buying a concert CD. I am expecting to hear the band's performance, not the audience's. Oh, the occasional sing-along is expected, and does not detract from the overall experience. But Rush in Rio is ridiculous. Whoever approved this mix is either stupid, deaf, or malicious. For Rush to release this shows either utter greed or disrespect for their fans. Geddy, Neil, Alex, shame on you.The drums are there in the mix somewhere, an indistinct thudding and crashing at the back of the stage, the bass is thundering but has no articulation, the guitar simply a roar of indistinct notes behind the constant yelling of the most distrespectful concert audience since the Beatles played Shea Stadium. You can kind of hear Geddy trying to eke out the melody behind the other mass of musical waveforms. Sometimes he bleeds through a bit, sometimes not.From what I could occasionally hear of the band on Rush in Rio, their instrumental and vocal artistry is as good as ever. I truly would have liked to hear this concert, to hear all of what they were singing and playing. But I can't. And that is so frustrating, I must strike out in anger with this negative review. In terms of sound, you could probably easily find better bootleg recordings of other Rush concerts on the internet.Write your congressman. There oughta be a LAW! Doesn't the Federal Trade Commission control shoddy and defective merchandise? This album is exhibit one.

This just shouldn't have happened. What were they thinking?Frankly, I didn't think the Fox English dub was perfect. The voice actors seemed a little too earnest. Let's just say I thought it lacked subtlety, but in what is basically a children's movie, this is quite forgivable.The new Disney English cast changes the way we perceive the characters, and not for the better. It makes Totoro somehow darker. There are dialogue changes (compared to the Fox edition) which simply do not work for me, apart from issues with the voice acting itself.The Disney version is still a charming movie, but the Fox version is more charming. The Fox dubbing makes it more sincere, in a way.

Carla is a 30-something office worker, secretary to the boss of a real estate development firm in Paris. She wears frumpy clothing, and works hard. Too hard. She also has a handicap -- she is hearing-impaired, and underneath her hair, she wears hearing aids in both ears. Her co-workers do not fraternize with her, and they make fun of her plain appearance and un-sexines. She knows this, because she can read their lips from across the lunch room. She longs for excitement and romance.Carla is the boss's right arm. Very competent, but overworked. One day, she collapses in exhaustion, and her boss suggests that she hire an assistant to help relieve some of the drudgework she's been doing.She agrees, but her first candidate turns out to be an ex-con. He lies about his office skills, but she hires him and tries to groom him into a decent employee, probably just to have some male company. He's attractive in an unkempt, roguish sort of way, and she trains him as a gofer and copy-room worker.The trailer says something like, "She taught him good manners... He taught her to be bad." In fact, she uses him, by asking him to steal a file from one of her colleagues who cheated her out of a development property she had been working on. The colleague is completely humiliated by the loss of the file, and Carla has to step in to deliver the pitch for the property before the local development council. Score one for the deaf girl.Things get a bit dicier when the ex-con sees a chance to get back at a loan shark he's indebted to, and make some bucks in the process. He needs Carla's lip-reading skills -- to spy on the shark's apartment while his gang plans the caper. The scheme goes sour, and therein lies the action and suspense that one reviewer called "Hitchcockian."I don't see much of Hitchcock in this film, but it is a good story, the characters are well-drawn and superbly acted. There's a little double entendre in the title, I think. The actress who plays Carla has full lips that frown and quiver and pout and twist throughout the film -- she's a great actress -- and a lot of her emotion is read by watching those lips. You don't always agree with the choices this lady makes, but you certainly can sympathize with the loneliness and boredom that drives her to make them.

If you want to see, in brief, Michael Crichton's motivation for writing this novel and the genesis of its themes, do a web search for a speech Crichton gave in 2003 at Caltech, titled "Aliens Cause Global Warming."Crichton is using the issue of global warming to focus our attention on a much broader problem in society -- the gullibility of the press and the public when dealing with "universally accepted" scientific and medical truths. Crichton said that as a child he saw science as the best hope for mankind. (Highly misplaced in his faith there, in my opinion, but this is where he began his journey.) He became disillusioned when he saw science being hijacked for ends other than the pursuit of truth.Quasi-science became science in the minds of the public when the idea of SETI (the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence) first came to be publicized. So also with the issue of nuclear-winter, whose promoters fell flat on their faces when predicting climate change due to the oil fires in Kuwait.In his speech, Crichton develops example after example where the "consensus" in science turned out to be smoking their own socks. Global warming is only the latest and largest example of consensus science, which is founded on unproven assumptions, and therefore is a monolith with feet of clay. Consensus, by itself, is not science. Consider the history of science, and this will be self-evidently true. Herd mentality can get the better of scientists, and it often does.We must learn to be smart about what is being served to us as science by the media. For Michael Crichton to even attempt to address this pressing social and educational issue in a popular novel merits four stars, I think. People should at least read Crichton's speech, if they cannot manage a 600-page novel. Either way, people need to understand that they are vulnerable to being bamboozled by the scientific establishment, on many issues. This book dramatizes one particular case. Hopefully it will make people more cautious about what they will unthinkingly swallow as "unquestioned fact."Often art and preaching do not mix, but sometimes it is necessary to mix the two anyway.

Honestly, I have not been happy with the sound of Rush albums since the old Moving Picture days. The band was an early adopter of digital recording, and digital recording did not mature as a technology until recently. A lot of their recordings have sounded a bit thin and compressed since they went digital, especially the Peter Collins-produced CDs.But of all the bad-sounding Rush albums, this is the worst. Every instrument sounds as if it is trying to fight its way through a thick blanket. There is no variation between loud and soft. There is only a variation between loud and louder. There is a haze of digital distortion over the entire soundstage. Possibly the band have gone half deaf from years of touring and simply cannot be trusted to oversee the mixing of their own music. I'm sure Beethoven would not have trusted himself to judge how his orchestra sounded in his later years. Rush should let someone with talented and younger ears advise them.In the words and music department, I found this to be their best and most consistent batch of songs in a long time, maybe even going back to Hold Your Fire, circa 1987. The songs hold up to repeated listening. I have few complaints here. They meet the musical and lyrical standard we've come to expect from Rush.The performances are fantastic, solid, and adequate. Specifically, Neil Peart's drumming is fantastic, although it is mixed too far to the rear of the soundstage. It should be prominently mixed to the foreground, as it was in YYZ from the Moving Pictures album. Geddy's bass playing, again sadly muddied by a bad sound mix, is wonderful -- an entertainment all its own, if you listen closely to it. Alex's guitar work is just adequate. He contributes little to the mix here except for some thrumming and mad strumming.Where are the guitar solos? Good grief! Rush without guitar solos is like a Big Mac without a hamburger bun. I think the music suffers because Alex did not seem inspired to write interesting guitar parts.Taken as a whole, Geddy and Neil more than make up for Alex's lack. This is a smoking band. And Alex does make up in energy what he holds back in technique on these songs. These old fogies can still rock!One last quibble. Geddy Lee's voice is what it is. Love it or hate it. I have no problem with it, after he stopped that warbly screeching he did in the first few Rush albums. However, Geddy has tried to add vocal harmony parts to his repertoire, and I don't think he harmonizes with himself very well. Let's just say I find the result a little grating. Rush should stick to a single voice -- maybe double-tracked for effect, but leave off the harmony. The only other voice I want to hear in a Rush song is Alex stepping up to the mike and saying "Subdivisions."

First, let me put the five star rating in context. Five stars are freely given in so many customer reviews that the five star rating has been devalued by overuse. In my opinion, XTC made some music I wouldn't bother to listen to all the way through even once. Less than one star for me. Some of their albums are worth three or four stars.This album, however, stands at the pinnacle of anything any band has ever attempted or achieved. Not to say that it is better than Sgt. Pepper or other great records. But it holds its own. It must be considered one of the five or ten best albums of the 1980s.I would call this music chamber pop. It quotes eloquently from sixties-style British pop, but adds elements of jazz, all produced and layered to perfection with XTC's inimitable style. All the elements here are precisely and deliberately placed, like a classical composition (with distorted guitars!). The thought and care with which these musical collages have been assembled created songs that are intensely interesting and musically involving. They stand up to repeated listening and analysis. As an experience, it is a marvel and a wonder to listen to these... I won't call them songs, I will call them compositions.The recording is only fair, at best. One could only wish George Martin had been there to oversee the recording engineers. I have the remastered GOLD CD version, and really it is only slightly better than the original Geffen release. Since the old Geffen version can be purchased used for $1 or less, there is no excuse not to own a copy of this masterwork.Andy Partridge was at the height of his lyrical powers, and his quirky harmonic ideas were harnessed and channeled into powerful, communicative, and anthemic songs. Colin Moulding's songs are melodic and beautiful, but his busy bass playing throughout rivals McCartney's work in the Beatles' best tunes. It is great entertainment to listen to this album all the way through, focusing only on the bass parts. Dave Gregory completed the tapestry with his always-appropriate guitars, and his presence was sorely missed on the last two XTC albums, as if both Partridge and Moulding had lost their right arms.Other reviewers have praised the individual songs, so I won't belabor the point. And what is the point? Just this: if you love pop music, buy this CD.

When Sting quit the Police, he was burned out. Obviously he was burned out on the Police, not on music. Dream of the Blue Turtles was a respectable debut as a solo artist, and then came the tour that spawned the movie Bring On The Night and the excellent concert album of the same name. Sting worked with top-drawer jazz musicians on that tour, and many of them worked in the studio on Sting's next solo album, Nothing Like The Sun. Creatively, Sting was on fire.The musicianship here is without parallel. Manu Katche on percussion is explosive but also delicate when the mood calls for it. Branford Marsalis's sweet sax tone graces many tunes here. Andy Summers provides glorious guitar textures on a couple of tracks. Hiram Bullock's guitar solo on the Hendrix tribute Little Wing is absolutely epic. Kenny Kirkland's keyboards are a prime feature.These great musicians are employed on some of the finest songwriting Sting has ever done. Some are humorous or lightweight (Englishman In New York, We'll Be Together), whimsical (Rock Steady, a Noah's Ark retelling), meditative (Sister Moon, Fragile), poetical (Secret Marriage). There is a breadth of material here, but all are composed and arranged and produced with great care and skill: words, music, and performance.I had not played this album for perhaps a decade when my eyes came across it on my shelf yesterday. After all this time, the album held my attention for the full 55 minutes, and gained a renewed admiration. It makes 99% of today's pop albums pale by comparison. Who today is doing creative work like this? I don't think Sting himself ever equalled this album, though Ten Summoner's Tales comes close.If you own this album, I urge you to pull it out and enjoy it again. If you don't own it, at least go to a library and check it out, or find a place on the web where you can stream it. Maybe you will find the same things to admire in it I did.A word about the recording. Nothing Like The Sun sounds so different from most modern pop recordings. There is ample dynamic range, from whispers and small percussive sounds to mighty snare whacks and wailing guitars. Today's typical pop release is pumped up to the point that there are only two dynamics -- loud, and louder. Those with the best stereo systems will appreciate the sense of space on Nothing Like The Sun, with a warm echo-ey ambience, and Sting seeming a little removed from the listener, not directly in front and breathing down your chest. Generally the sound is very clear, except for We'll Be Together, which sounds vaguely overdriven and closed-in and lacking in the kind of acoustic openness that I mentioned above. At times one will detect a certain "tizz" in the high frequencies, especially the hi-hat and cymbals -- this seems to be common in earlier digital recordings. Apart from that, it's a very respectable technical effort as well a musical one.

I can't imagine anyone who attended this concert not coming away pleased, and this album is a fine document. Grappelli is always lyrical, agile in a way that belies his years. Pizzarelli (and son, on a couple of tracks) is unobtrusively supportive, everyone is in sync and in sympathy. In fact the only small part of the disc I find off-putting is when Pizzarelli starts trying to play Nuages like a freight train chugging down the track in the middle of his improvisation. Grappelli seems to have an affinity above all for the Gershwin tunes. Just my opinion. The recording quality is about the best one could hope for. This is class, through and through. Warm, affectionate, seasoned jazz music by experienced, aged-like-fine-wine players. Smooth like caramel.

Batman Beyond, and especially the first season episodes, are extremely well-done from the standpoint of voice acting, scripts, lots of action, beautiful visuals. I can attest that these shows have great replay potential. Fans can watch them again and again. I've probably seen the pilot episode six or eight times now. As such buying the DVD season set is a great value.All the more reason to rail against the dunderheads at Warner Brothers for putting this in cheap cardboard that makes it hard to separate the inner folder from the outer slipcover. Shame, shame, shame on those responsible. Hello? They have these plastic things called keepcases now. They will even hold two discs in one case. Why not use them?Again, great content. Disgustingly cheap packaging. It's a joy and a disappointment at the same time. I suggest putting the discs in CD jewelcases for easy access, so you won't have to fight with the *&!$# box every time you want to play the series again.

The photography and many of the effects are stunningly beautiful in this continuation of the Dune saga. Most of the actors perform superbly, and it is a pleasure simply to watch them ply their trade.I see two major deficiencies. First, while the Atreides may be very brave, I don't find them especially sympathetic. Paul's sister descends heartbreakingly into madness, and certainly we feel for her tragedy. But the others are more coldly calculating, and I cannot warm to either Paul or his offspring in this production. Paul loses his sight, and eventually his life, yet I felt little sympathy. It is as if he is only a soulless cog in a universal machine, acting his predetermined (and already foreseen) part with remorseless resignation.Second, the action is focused so narrowly on the court intrigues and plots between the royal houses on Kaitain and Arrakis, I really didn't get a sense of a story set in a galaxy-spanning empire. In other words, this story seems less epic than the first film, and the events have less gravity -- being more of the order of personal struggles than clashes of great nations or great philosophical ideals. This IS a change of character compared to the first Dune miniseries, and not a change for the better.

I enjoyed Steve Martin's L.A. Story because he combined fantasy with comedy -- he did not deny his wacky screwball side. He used that as an asset in a romantic comedy.This film sinks under the weight of its own intention to be somewhat realistic and serious. Oh yes, a few funny things happen, and it may elicit a giggle or a snort here and there. But Martin's character is simply wooden, subdued, uncharismatic, not very charming... maybe the best description of him is simply "burned out." The worst thing is that we don't learn enough about this man to know why he is that way, or why he makes a play for the young girl Mirabelle. All we know is that he's apparently in "software" and has oodles of money.Claire Danes' Mirabelle is clearly more winning in her quiet shyness, politeness, and sympathetic in her mild depression and her longing for emotional intimacy and love reciprocated. But we also get little sense of a back story as to where this passive girl comes from and who she really is. She creates art through drawing and photographs, but there is no sense of what motivates that, either.I have left the worst for last -- the Jeremy character is certainly the most colorful. Perhaps he is the only real color in this film. But compared to the book, I think his transformation from ignorant shlub to respectable man is so glossed over that the filmgoer is mostly at a loss as to how this happens. He goes away for a year, reads a few self-help books, and buys a suit -- this is going to change him into someone who can truly love Mirabelle?Who are these people? Why do they do behave as they do? Shopgirl makes you feel the things happening in the movie, but this emotional content is without intellectual context to understand. I don't think I was bored while I was watching Shopgirl. Claire Danes is enough of an actress that we feel her depression, her joy in a sense of love and belonging with the older man (however false the foundation of that might be), and her distress as the reality of her situation begins to creep over her. The film engages the heart. But the next morning, you are going to realise that this film lacks supporting characters that are anything more than cardboard cutouts or cartoons.Steve Martin is an enormously talented writer and performer. He really dropped the ball here. Shopgirl the novella was good, but not great. You sort of grade the book on a curve because Martin is branching out into new territory, and you don't expect mastery of the genre. Shopgirl the movie is, at best, something to use to pass the time. The characters in the book are thin, but their movie counterparts are thinner than thin. They go here, and they do that, and they feel this, but we never really know why. "It's just life," Martin says in one of the final voiceovers. Yeah, but I require life to involve a little more analysis than this movie ever attempts.

Technically, you could buy RLJ's first and second albums and you'd have the best of Rickie Lee Jones. Rickie Lee never again equalled the orchestrated hipster pop of the eponymously titled Rickie Lee Jones and her sophomore effort Pirates. There were flashes of such energy and brilliance elsewhere, but no other album was a sustained success from start to finish.It was probably a wise business decision for Rhino records to attempt this collection instead of simply remastering those first two masterpiece albums. I don't consider it an artistic triumph, however.On the plus side, Rhino has equalized or otherwise processed the original material so carefully that songs from different recording venues using different techniques of recording (digital and analog) sound now sound organically whole and integrated with each other. Mainly this involved cutting down a lot of the high frequency content of the originals, rendering Rickie Lee's voice less piercing, but also de-emphasizing the percussion and the brilliant overtones of the guitars. That's not an unreservedly good thing, but it works in the context of making an anthology album.The alphabetical organization of the tracks does not really work, either. Normally such collections are laid out chronologically, and that probably would have been a better choice here, except that it would have made the falloff in the quality of RLJ's recordings more evident.The bonus tracks, demos, and miscellaneous on disc three are interesting for the RLJ fan. I don't see them as having lasting replay value.Listening to this set has lowered Rickie Lee Jones' art in my estimation. I already own most of her records in one format or another. But if this is supposed to RLJ's best, then one must admit that the best of albums like Magazine and Ghostyhead are a bit overrated. Rhino should just get on with remastering her first and second albums.

Al Stewart is responsible for three or four albums that stand at the pinnacle of popular music achievement. Maybe he doesn't deserve a rock and roll hall of fame induction -- because he isn't primarily a rock musician -- but he deserves a lifetime achievement Grammy, for works like Year of the Cat, Time Passages, Last Days of the Century, and Between the Wars (an album which overcomes its low budget and underproduction by the sheer force of the fantastic songs Al wrote).Between these feats of brilliance, there are albums which do not fully succeed. Russians & Americans was a bit of a mess. A lot of it sounds really dated now. And Famous Last Words has a few great moments, but only that. 24 Parrots/Carrots and Al's "wine" album, Down in the Cellars are solid, but not quite in the top tier.A Beach Full of Shells is in the good but not great category. The Immelman Turn, the CD's opener, is another fine aviation song, but not equal to Flying Sorcery from Year of the Cat. Mr. Lear is a quaint, charming whimsical tune. Royal Courtship is perhaps too droll by half -- about the stulted manner of courtship through intermediaries, perhaps recalling Queen Elizabeth I's many attempts at courting, usually keeping suitors at arm's length, delaying, running hot and cold until her political ends had been achieved.Somewhere In England is a great historical and philosophical tune -- about the enthusiasm with which a nation can enthusiastically embark on war, not seeing the terrible consequences that can result when things go amiss.Al looks ahead to his own declining years in another fabulous charmer, Katherine of Oregon. It sounds like he is preparing to play the part of an alternately grumpy and charming old geezer. Hopefully it will be many years before Stewart's activities are limited to poisoning pidgeons in the park, though. His fans want him to take a shot at recording a few more albums of sublime history-themed songs.Those are the highlights. Mona Lisa Talking appears to be inspired by the Bob Hoskins movie of that name. Class of 58 is a tribute to the era, nostalgic for Al perhaps, but once you've heard the joke, it isn't really so funny the second time. Gina in the King's road is about a groupie from the good old days of the 60's folk scene.If you can buy individual tracks somewhere, my recommendation would be to get Immelman Turn, Somewhere in England, and Katherine of Oregon. I think those are the tunes ones with the most staying power.This is fine music, and Al is far from a has-been. Still, one wishes for a more substantial musical meal than we find on A Beach Full of Shells.

I confess that if I was to go to a Carole King concert, I'd want to see her with a full band. I recall a Carole King special that ran during PBS fundraising week, about 10 years ago. It was in a circa 2000-seat concert hall, with a six piece band or so. It was fantastic.Some people can do a great solo concert. I'm thinking of the Don McLean Solo album from the mid-1970s. That couldn't be improved upon. Carole King's songs are beautiful, but most of them need more than the minimal instrumental backup they get here to reach their full potential. I think they were written with drums, bass, guitars in mind -- most of them, at least.A few of the reviewers have complained about Carole's voice. Huh? Have they really listened to the old recordings? This live recording is not top notch technically, and Carole's voice is not what it was. But, to steal a line from I, Claudius, "It never was what it was!" It is adequate, maybe with just a touch of rasp that comes with age. Certainly her pipes have held up waaaaaay better than Joni Mitchell.But the bottom line of is, listening to this album I can't believe the number of catchy songs Carole King has written. Some of them are bubblegum, but it is all entertaining. Carole doesn't aim for the grandiose or the airy-fairy. Her sentiments are "pure and simple, sweet and true," as the line from one of her songs (One to One) goes. And she just wins over the audience. I started the first disc, only intending to listen to selected cuts, and got sucked in -- I couldn't turn it off. Her music makes you feel warmth and joy and love. What a relief from the cynicism and aggressiveness of much of today's music. Just put on Carole's CD, and you've got peace in the valley.I'm not sure about the replay value of this album. But even if you only play it once or twice, it's less expensive than going to a concert these days.It could be a little better, but it's sure 'nuff good as it is.

Listening to this record is a bit frustrating for me. Some of it calls to mind the best of Stan's past work, namely his albums Partyball and Anatomy. Yes, there are some fugitive songs here. Stan gravitates toward the dark underbelly of society for his subject matter. Yet, somehow this batch of miscreants seems a little more conventional, a little more sane than his usual cast of characters. Sadly, that makes them less interesting.Into The Sun is a fine start -- about new beginnings. The music, the soaring synths and yearning in Stan's voice, delivers the goods. Other examples of atmospheric production that does justice to the songs: Monsters Of The Id, Our Manhattan Moment, maybe even Hollywood Ending.But the carnival atmosphere of Running With The Carnival is a bit too predictable.Talkin Wall Of Voodoo Blues is a chance for Stan to get some things off his chest about the old band, and how they all got screwed by the record business. The song itself is a bit monotonous, and lyrically not clever at all. "We made a lot of noise/For all the girls and boys/It was 1977/Now two are gone to heaven." Ahhhh, you get the picture. A lot of the rhymes on this record are a little forced, and often the words don't quite flow smoothly with the melody.Wake Up Sally -- too sing song-y.My Rose Marie is unusually sentimental for Stan Ridgway -- about a veteran who still pines for the gal he left behind when he went to war many years past. I thought the vocals on this song sounded a little too strained. A lighter touch was needed -- something like Stan's vocals on Partyball's Right Through You. And the synthesized orchestrations gave only a suggestion of the grandeur this song could have with acoustic instruments.With tweaking of the lyrics, a bit of restraint on some of the cheap-sounding keyboards, more work on vocal phrasing and tone, sophisticated programming on the rhythm tracks, and you'd have a record that's a more complete artistic statement and less a glorified demo tape. That is how most of these songs strike me -- just shy of what's needed.Other fans have obviously been wowed by the performaces on Snakebite. Perhaps they focused on some quality that I missed. I hear a lot of potential, but I can't quite give this record a passing grade. Songs: Need editing. Arrangements: Too simple. Sound: Production a bit primitive -- expand and enhance. I won't beat this to death. Amazon.com is offering a free download of Talkin Wall Of Voodo Blues. Get it. Compare it to with anything on Partyball, and you'll see what I'm complaining about.

Although not a stellar effort, Looking East is respectable. For me, the songs Looking East, Barricades of Heaven, and Culver Moon have lasting repeat-play value. The rest of the album is an entertaining listen once through at least.Barricades is a great song, and like many great songs, I cannot explain to anyone why it is great. The music, words, beat, and mood all combine into a whole that remains, for me at least, rather hypnotic and undefinable. I honestly cannot tell you what barricades he's talking about, or what kind of redemption he means. Poetic words and poetic music -- make your own meaning out of it.The hippie-dippy "we are one world" message of It Is One is clich&eacute; and tiresome. The other songs are just ruminations of Jackson's forty-odd years of life on the planet.The opening track, Looking East, seems so appropriate today, when many are achingly disaffected with society and government. I like the rocking guitars and the power of Jackson's voice, too. Jackson sings, "There's a God-sized hunger underneath the laughing and the rage." Yet, this was written in the middle of President Clinton's two terms. Irony? Oh yes, a "God-sized" irony, if you ask me. But Browne remains hopeful, "looking east," waiting for the sun. I guess that is what keeps Browne's preaching from becoming opressive. He doesn't lose a sense of life's joys and hope, like so many whiny and humorless liberals.Jackson's latest studio effort, Naked Ride Home is a better album musically and lyrically. I think it compares favorably with some of his early work. But I bought Looking East used for about 30 cents plus the shipping -- under three dollars total. For the three songs in Looking East that I'll enjoy far into the future, that's a bargain.

This hour-long collection of dreamy, moody, pop music continues in the vein of the second half of Ivy's classic Long Distance CD: sweet, melodic, airy. (Multi-instrumentalist and singer Andy Chase, composer or co-composer of all the songs here, is one of the three minds behind Ivy.) Brookville is pleasant and relaxing, the antidote to a hectic day. Of the thirteen tracks, eight are vocals and five instrumentals. I think the instrumentals are more suited to film soundtracks, but perhaps others will appreciate these loop-based constructions more than I did. The instrumentals stimulate daydreamy pictures in the cortex -- with the sense that there ought to be a movie to go with them.I found myself thinking of odd associations, listening to this music. Andy Chase's voice -- Art Garfunkel without the breathiness. The beat and synthesizers of Beatiful View evoke Everything But the Girl, and the instrumental Home, with its horn ensemble and sweet trumpet lines somehow brings to mind the melancholy ending of a Charlie Brown TV special.For the overall rating, if all-time classic records like Sgt. Pepper or The Wall or even Ivy's Long Distance rate five stars, then a fair rating here would be 3 or 4 stars. (I upgraded this rating by a half-star after several more listens to this album.) The production is a bit less meticulous and the work a bit more experimental than a full band release from Ivy or Fountains of Wayne. But it is all listenable. Some songs are more likeable than others, I didn't think any one of the thirteen tracks was added just to fill up the space. This is a very classy album.Tracks like Summer Parade, This is How It Ends (the final track, wink wink), and Shine are some of the most mature and well-crafted pop tunes released just lately. I didn't dig into the lyrics that much, but whatever Andy is singing about seems to sink down into your soul, imparting a sense of peaceful sadness that goes beyond any lyrical analysis.If only every solo experiment of artists who normally work in a group context were this good, the music world would be a happier place.

Babylon 5 had a sort of grandeur to it, in the sweep of the story, the relationships between the characters, the social issues that were skewered or commented on, and the galactic peril that developed as its main story arc. It was hoped that Crusade could succeed Babylon 5 for another five successful years, carrying on the history of humans after the Shadow War and the formation of the planetary Alliance.Crusade was, so to speak, murdered in its crib. It never got much of a chance to grow. It never had all the strengths of its predecessor, and it suffered a few weaknesses as well.Briefly, what I liked about the series: Galen, the enigmatic techno-mage, who was probably the best actor and got the best speeches. Dureena, the alien thief whose sass was entertaining and whose courage got the Crusade team out of a pickle or two. As the series progressed the crew were starting to develop a sense of family and camaraderie, like the Babylon 5 team. The Excalibur was a pretty ship, and quite a few interior sets were built to show different parts of the craft.Weaknessess: The special effects of ships in orbit and in battle were good. The special effects of planetary landscapes looked cheap. The musical score wasn't as weighty or as appropriate as the music for Babylon 5. Gary Cole's Captain Gideon is a more flawed and somewhat less heroic figure, compared to B5's Cap'n Sheridan. In a way that makes him more interesting, but he also seems to have a dangerously headstrong or capricious streak. (To say nothing of his questionable tactic of getting advice from an alien machine called an "apocalypse box" that has a tendency to give false information.) The lack of a great story arc to tie the episodes together was somewhat of a weakness. Whereas B5 dealt with interplanetary conflicts between whole races, and the war between two super-powerful ancient alien powers, Crusade's plots were narrowly focused on one spacecraft and its mission to find a cure for a planetary plague. The scale is somehow smaller.After watching all 13 episodes, I find myself overlooking a lot of the ways that it fell short. I'm quite fond of it, and will watch it again from time to time. But it falls short of the standard set by Firefly, or even B5.

The actors in Primer seem inexperienced and unable to play much emotion. But that's not the problem with this movie.The script is dense, and about 2/3 of the way through the film, it becomes almost impossible to understand exactly what is happening, and why. But that's not the problem with this movie.If I did watch the requisite number of times needed to figure out the puzzle of what is actually happening in this film, it would not matter, because I do not care about what happens to any of these bland, directionless people. That is the problem with Primer.After finishing the film, I started to go through it again, this time listening to the director's commentary. As he described the rehearsals, how much of the sound had to be redubbed, how the film's only special effects shot was done on his home computer, I thought to myself, 'Even if he eventually does explain the plot to me, I really could care less!' So, I gave up, and saved mysefl the time.I like films that one can watch over and over again, catching new details and enjoying newly-noticed nuance. My Dinner With Andre would be an example of such a film. This movie is not worth watching once, except as a demonstration of what is technically possible on a low budget, filming with Super 16mm film, and editing with a computer. The technique is only worthwhile if you have characters who are worth knowing, and the characters in Primer are hardly more dimensional than the paper the script was printed on.I wasted a free Blockbuster movie rental on this obtuse excuse for drama. That's the saddest part of all.

I'm at a loss to explain the five star ratings for Wrap Around Joy. I've been pleased with much of Carole King's work, notably Tapestry, which deserves its enormous success. I've also enjoyed some of her lesser-known albums: One To One, Simple Things, Rhymes & Reasons. Those albums weren't wall-to-wall greatness, but had many special songs and qualities.Wrap Around Joy, by contrast, falls short. Probably it is the songs themselves. I don't find a lot of poetry in them. They certainly sound like Carole King melodies, with Carole King chord progressions, and Carole's singing and keyboard playing do not depart from her other early 1970s albums. Jazzman is a nice, sweet, commercial radio song. I like Nightengale, too. Overall, the lyrics seem a little trite and forced. Maybe this is reinforced by the full production of gospel-like choruses, brass, saxophones, etc. As if being tarted up will mask the tired-sounding underlying material.It's not bad, by any means, especially for casual listening. However, none of the songs on Wrap Around Joy move me as much as You've Got a Friend, So Far Away, or even the short and snappy Bitter With The Sweet from Rhymes & Reasons. This album sounds like Carole King wrote it to fulfill a contract, to feed the hit-making machine that she had become 35 years ago. Being the professional that she is, she could turn out an album-full of competent compositions. Competent, but not special, not magical as some of her other output. I would advise casual fans to pass on this. At the very least, I would judge it a non-essential part of King's catalog.

Not a good recording. The sound quality borders on crappy, for a studio recording. At least there is an ambiance of the recording venue. It isn't acoustically dead. Gives it atmosphere.The songs are pretty good, and Dylan sings with some power, but a bit brash and harsh vocally. (Though compared to his voice nowadays, you could describe his vocals on Shot Of Love as dulcet tones.)Somehow the record transcends these faults, and I'm rather fond of it, in spite of it all. The two gospel records preceding Shot of Love -- Slow Train Coming and Saved -- have a slick glossy production. This is more garage-band style. But I suppose one could argue that it is more spontaneous, more "real."The point is, Dylan has done worse. Far worse. Shot Of Love is an essential part of his overtly religious period.

I was shocked to see an average rating of 3.4 on the review rating of this book. Obviously disappointed evolutionists, feeling the heat, are piling on to diss the book. (over 400 reviews!) I note that even some of the harshest critics praise the book's readability.Frankly, if you are undecided about evolutionary theory, if your mind is in the slightest degree open to an opinion that opposes the &quot;standard model&quot; of biology, i.e. Darwinism, this is a good book to help you understand why creationism is still a hot topic.Evolutionists point to the fossils. And indeed, we look at the fossils and see more advanced life forms as time goes on. However, this does not prove the mechanism by which one simpler life form might have changed into a more advanced one. This book examines in detail just how astoundingly difficult that would have been, even given &quot;billions and billions&quot; of years. Random mutation is not up to the task assigned it. This is intuitively obvious when we examine example after example after example (in Behe's book) of the astounding interconnectedness and complexity of the multitude of cellular &quot;machine parts.&quot;As a matter of fact (OK, now someone will immediately jump on me and claim this is not true, but read the book and you will see the evidence yourself, don't take my word), there is already genetic evidence that the proposed &quot;evolutionary tree of life&quot; is wildly out of whack. Life forms that are supposed to be closely related are not as close genetically as life forms that are supposed to be relatively unrelated. See chapter 12 (A Biochemical Echo of Typology) of Michael Denton's classic book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis.And let's be fair with the fossil evidence, too. What is trumpeted as &quot;gradual change&quot; is really not that gradual. Often new forms of life, new organs and new tissue structures spring out of nowhere, with zero preceding forms in the fossil record. In the Cambrian explosion, within a period of about 10 million years or less, 70 new body plans (phyla) for living creatures appeared out of nowhere. There was no gradualism here. Since the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago, there have been no new body plans seen! Evolution is gradual? Hahahahahahah. Howls of derisive laughter. In the Cambrian, &quot;evolution&quot; has a wild party, and since then, as far as major innovation goes, the party is over. So even the fossil argument is lame at a certain level.The very nature of the organs and systems we see in biology virtually precludes their gradual development (over ANY time span, no matter how long), by virtue of the number of complex parts that must be precisely fitted to one another, of which the lack of any one would compromise function. This book is an introduction to the astounding world of cellular chemical machinery -- astounding in its Rube Goldberg-like complexity. There must be a great fear in the Darwinian community that knowledge like this could become widely understood.Read the book, and you will begin to understand why nearly everything the average person THINKS he/she knows about evolution is wrong. This is not only a great book, it is a gift to the world, that modern education might be healed of the temporary blindness of Darwinism, and brought into the light of truth about what biology really tells us about origins.

I was expecting more out of Garbarek after his Twelve Moons CD, which contains more than its share of magical moments. Visible World is a hodgepodge of songs done specifically for this record combined with songs from other recording projects (i.e. film). Some are distinctly Scandanavian, some sound like American Indians in the fjords. Not that there's anything wrong with that. :) But most of the playing seems calculated to soothe, not to challenge. Yes, there is a valid Kenny G-ish comparison here.If one was rating this on the Kenny G scale, it would be a 5. But judged against Garbarek's best work, albums like Dis or Dansere or even My Song with Keith Jarrett, this is a dud -- maybe a 1 or 2. I guess Garbarek has made the mistake of being too good in the past -- making his own grading curve more difficult.

I haven't read the book. The film has relatively little action, consisting mostly of conversations. In that sense, it owes something to the Sherlock Holmes tradition of tracking down a mystery.There is a "mole" in the "circus." The mole is working for the now-defunct USSR, at the height of the cold war. I'm still not sure what the circus is, but it is a division of British intelligence. George Smiley (Alec Guinness) was thrown out of his job at the circus, following the death of his mentor, Control, the head of the circus. Or should I call him the ringleader?Now Smiley is called back into action to sniff out and expose the mole. He interviews a complex cast of characters, reviews secret files, and eventually sets a trap. As this unfolds over 6 hours, you will be drawn in by the performances, the possible solutions to the mystery, the utter believability and class with which this mini-series was made.After seeing it once, I immediately wanted to watch it again. There is so much detail in the series, so many characters, you cannot possibly catch it all in the first viewing, unless you already read the book. It would be worth watching twice just for the note-perfect performances of the entire cast.This was no Hollywood production. It was filmed in 16mm, and that's the only drawback to the DVD. It is grainy, and not especially clear. The DVD probably represents the print fairly well. I would have preferred that the company who mastered this DVD set had invested some effort in digitally cleaning up the video before releasing it. The visual quality is akin to what you might have seen in those old documentary movies in grade school if you're old enough to remember when they used to actually show films instead of videos.The soundtrack is great for understanding the dialog. There is not much dynamic range, and the music is not impressively reproduced. It is what it is. It is adequate to the task, nothing more.You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but the picture could have been cleaned up a little. It does not detract markedly from the immense pleasure of watching these ace actors performing a great script. But I'd have to give a final rating of...Content 5 starsVideo/sound quality 3 stars

These reviews are almost always going one direction or the other, based on whether someone likes or dislikes President Obama's political persuasion. I'm hoping to look at this film as it is, good points and bad.My bias up front: Barack Obama is not a good president, for many factual reasons I could explain at length. His race does not matter (I happily voted for a man much blacker than Obama for governor, because he was the most intelligent and the most conservative candidate), and neither does it matter whether he was born in a log cabin in Illinois, or on the moon. I'm judging by performance. But the purpose of this review is not to count his demerits.While I believe there are critical points of interest in this movie for all Americans, I don't like the style of the film. It would have been better if a format like PBS' FRONTLINE or other documentary series had been followed, rather than presenting it as a faux autobiography, with a faux Obama narrating it.The other problem with the film is that it presents a possible alternate history without a distinction between facts the filmmaker uncovered, and extrapolations based on those facts. (To do so in the movie proper might have made for awkward viewing, but there ought to have been supplemental materials, either special features on the DVD or a booklet with source information, to clarify exactly what is fact, and what is reasonable conjecture.) However, much of the evidence is real photographic, text, and audio/video material that speaks for itself.A reasonably good circumstantial case is made for Frank Marshall Davis as the biological father of Barack Obama. If seeing the naked photos of the President's mother in the home of the alleged father, coupled with Davis' poetry and writing about "Ann," coupled with the fact that Frank is mentioned in Obama's own book as a mentor -- apparently they saw a lot of each other in Obama's teens -- if this evidence does not raise more than a twinge of doubt in the viewer's mind, I would judge that the viewer is simply rejecting the evidence on emotional grounds. The photographs comparing the appearance of the Kenyan legal father and the alleged biological father with Obama's appearance today and in the past is by itself sufficient to raise at least a twinge of doubt.The more important material in the film has to do with Obama's associations throughout life, not his DNA. Again, much of this evidence is circumstantial, but the current movie "2016" probably bolsters and adds to this evidence (I have not seen the film).I'm not credulous, but neither am I willing to throw out an alternative narrative simply because there are flaws in the presentation. There are major flaws in President Obama's own memoir Dreams From My Father. David Maraniss' recent biography of Obama, according to Buzzfeed, convincingly disputes at least 38 elements of Obama's life and story as told by Obama. Similarly, the Michael Moore films and Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth are both heavily laden with innuendo and factoids. If we want to exclude Dreams From My Real Father from serious consideration, we must shun other forms of agitprop as well.While I would have wished this to be a better production, I'll take it for what it is -- documentary evidence mixed with informed speculation. The film's ultimate conclusion is that Obama is heavily influenced by his Marxist biological father (Frank Marshall Davis) and has a Marxist agenda to bring socialism to America. The viewer can judge for himself how much this seems to have played out in Obama's political rhetoric and his actions as President. My personal observation is that Obama has been unbelievably kind to the oligarchs in the banking industry, bailouts galore for them, with relative crumbs dropped to the "little people." Cronyism abounds. An ideological Marxist would not necessarily have followed that course. As I view the history of his nearly four years in office, I am more frequently reminded of Ayn Rand's portrayal of the dysfunctional grasping oligarchic government of fools in Atlas Shrugged than the philosophy of Marx or Lenin.I don't doubt that some of the material in this documentary can be disputed and refuted. But there must be a burden of proof on the disputers as much as the filmmaker himself. Or is it simply impossible for some to wrap their mind around the possibility that Clint Eastwood is right, that Obama is the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people, in many more ways than even conservatives had previously believed?If in doubt, if you are willing to consider new evidence of things you'd probably rather not believe, I suggest downloading an interview with the filmmaker. Do a Google search for Jan Mickelson's podcast (at libsyn), and type "gilbert" in the search box on the podcast page. (Mickelson is a central Iowa radio talk show host.) The June 13 program will give you a better sense of what to expect.

There are two things about Black Book that made me wish I had not spent the time watching it. Number one, the movie starts out several years after the main story. Because of this, we already know the ultimate outcome for the main character, and the suspense of all the travails of that character is blunted.Number two, the main character's situation and her trials are sympathetic. But the character is played so cool (not completely cold, but definitely cool) emotionally that I did not buy it. She gets in some incredibly tight spots and doesn't really show the tension and strain to make it believable. Not for me, at least. Maybe some people like that kind of a heroine, but honestly Lara Croft shows more humanity sometimes than this gal.These are two serious flaws. They didn't ruin the movie, but made it much less enjoyable.

First, this new tff effort is not a Beatle-esque album. Yes, in some elements of production it brings to mind the great Sir George Martin. In reality it is more a tribute to Sir Paul McCartney than the Beatles. The fractured (but very fun) first cut is similar to the cut-and-paste Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Venus & Mars/Rock Show, or Band on the Run from McCartney's albums of three decades past.As Yoko Ono will probably tell you, the Beatles was John Lennon's band, and you cannot evoke the Beatles without John's EDGE, musically and lyrically. (I'm being a little sarcastic here. McCartney was an invaluable member, an indispensible part of the team.) The tff boys keep things light and non-edgy. Happy ending time, indeed. tff's Last Days on Earth, the final track, is no silly love song. It's classy and sweet, but still a far cry from Lennon's soul-wrenching Yer Blues or the meditative seriousness of a song like Imagine.This tff album is less substantial than any tff album to date. Well produced, note-perfect, but mostly bloodless. Happy Ending's 12 tracks are whipped to a lovely fluffy cream. They all go down smoothly. But like stereotypcial Chinese meals, they leave one hungry almost the minute after the dish is consumed.Even McCartney hasn't made a decent McCartney album in 20 years, and maybe I'm being too hard on Roland and Curt. Middle age and a certain measure of success can take its toll on the creative process. I enjoy the title track, the closing track, and the charming single, Call Me Mellow. The other tunes do not call me back for a re-listen. Yeah, I can call tff mellow. But if I want mellow, I'll turn on Bebel Gilberto. Tears for Fears just isn't the same without a little stomach-churning angst. Frankly, I did not delve into the lyrics to see if they expressed anything dire or melancholic. But even if they do, the music won't let me be convinced they really meant it. In the end, boy gets girl and they live happily ever after.

Everything on this album is first class. The songs are peerless. The singing is emotional and powerful, but also delicate -- a tremendous range often within the same song. The musical styles vary from a small jazz combo in the title track, to country-flavored songs like No Cure For Love, hard driving pop-rock like First We Take Manhattan, and Joan of Arc, which is difficult to describe -- at first it is a pop ballad with Jennifer Warnes and Leonard Cohen trading poetic verses, but it crescendos to something approaching a choral symphony.The original CD release was fine, in terms of sound quality. This was an all digital recording, and it bore the sonic signature of many early digital recordings. The highest of the high frequencies -- cymbals, vocal sibilants -- had a bit of electronic "tizz." An unnatural fuzziness and bite. Otherwise, the sound seemed perhaps excessively smoothed. It was liquid and easy to take, but the finer details were obscured.This new remastered edition improves just about everything about the sound. Less "tizz," a more natural midrange, a sense of space around the individual instruments and voices. You could say it sounds more like an analog recording now. This is noticeable even when listening to the CD played back from the computer on headphones. An audiophile system will do more justice to the reproduction, of course.Highly recommended, both for the improvement in sonics, and the songs themselves. The bonus tracks did not strike me as essential, but they are certainly nice to have. A well-done and worthy re-issue.

I think if this was a 5-song extended play disc, I could give it four or five stars. Especially if it was priced at $6 or so. (Actually, as of this writing, a used copy can be purchased for not much more than that.)This is a return to form for McCartney, who remains a solid live performer. His albums? Following the excellent Tug of War, it was downhill.Honestly, there are two songs I'd rate as equal to his Beatles-era material. Namely, How Kind of You and Anyway.How Kind of You is slow and hypnotic, and if Coldplay had recorded a cover of this song, I doubt I would ever suspect they didn't write it, unless I'd heard Paul's original first.Anyway is marred by a tacked-on bunch of studio garbage that runs on for three minutes at the end. But apart from that, it is a fitting beautiful orchestral crescendo-building sign-off.Fine Line is clever and bouncy and catchy.Riding to Vanity Fair is uncharacteristically dark for Paul, but solid material nevertheless. In his Rolling Stone interview McCartney said that when he tries to do angry or emotionally dark music, he usually gets it all wrong. But this time he got it right.This Never Happened Before is the sort of shmaltz that Paul gets so much grief about, but shmaltz doesn't get any better than this.Producer Nigel Godrich really did make a difference, I think, wrenching the best he could from McCartney. Unfortunately, the juices just aren't flowing like they were in the 1970s, so the other tunes are listenable but not exceptional.It's great to hear Paul at the top of his game again, but it's hit and miss. This one will never rank up there with Ram and Band on the Run.

First, note that amazon's listing of tracks is incomplete. Click on the viewer images for a correct list.This was one of the first compact discs I purchased. It was a blind buy, from a record club. I played it a lot back then, and it became one of my favorites. This week I pulled it out and played it for the first time in many years. It still holds up. Maybe better than ever. This appears to be an early digital recording, or an early digital mastering. As such, the sound quality may not be the ultimate. Early digital can sometimes sound a little harsh, especially if the instrument is too close to the mike. On this CD, there is plenty of reverberation from the very acoustically "live" recording venue, which softens the presentation a bit and overall the sound is very good to excellent.I'm not an expert on classical music, or guitar music, though I play guitar -- nowhere near this league. Are there better performances of these Granados and Albeniz works? I doubt it. Different perhaps, but not likely better.The composers are Spanish, and the music sounds authentically Spanish. Bream plays with great control, with careful accent and variation in volume -- it makes the music sing and breathe. The melodic nature of the pieces themselves would make them easy on the ear no matter how they were played. But Bream is able to put considerable dynamic life into them, and quiet lyricism on the opening "Dedicatoria" by Granados. I appreciate the mixture of contemplative melody and lively dynamics, and I suppose that's why I played this disc so often circa 1990 when I bought it.If you are remotely sympathetic to this style of music and to the classical guitar, I doubt you will be disappointed in this release. For me, it has had great replay value. If you can find it at a reasonable price, do not hesitate.

This is a glorious album to listen to if you like immaculately produced pop music. Sometimes the words seem a bit trite.On the other hand, the "bonus track" on the US release, Feels Like Home, is simple, heartfelt, and it's been said a thousand times before, yet in Chantal's hands it becomes almost an anthem. You could even imagine a Mormon Tabernacle Choir of backing vocals on this track, and it wouldn't seem out of place. Such is the power of a good performance to elevate relatively mundane lyrics into music of the soul.The tracks I will listen to repeatedly are Time, Flying Home, and Feels Like Home. I can appreciate the other songs for their craft, the production, the beautiful sound that they make, but I don't love them like the three I mentioned.

There's no getting around it. Paul Simon is one of the greatest pop music songwriters of the 20th century. I've been listening to his solo albums in chronological order, and the work is fantastic up through the underrated One Trick Pony (which has always been a favorite of mine). I have no complaint until we get to Hearts and Bones. I think I'm more critical of it now than when it was released. The strong material is as good as anything Simon ever wrote. The weak material seems much weaker to me in retrospect.It is easy to skip the lesser tracks, and consider Hearts and Bones a fantastic EP. Allergies, Hearts and Bones, Train in the Distance, Rene and Georgette Magritte, and The Late Great Johnny Ace are the ones to treasure. Simon displays his talent for melody, complex and interesting chord structures, and sublime lyrics. A tour-de-force of pop songwriting.The rest is listenable, but well below the high standard Paul usually sets, and most of the time I skip the other tracks. Cars Are Cars is just silly. (Simon contributes vocals to Art Garfunkel's album Scissors Cut on a beautiful song titled In Cars, but I think that one was written by Jimmy Webb.) Maybe I Think Too Much is probably a true reflection of Mr. Simon, but the two versions of this tune aren't that much fun. Song About the Moon lopes along amiably enough, but a song about writing a song is a tricky thing, like a movie about making a movie. I don't find the song that clever.The album's overall mood is a bit depressed, and I guess Paul must have been in a bit of a funk while writing it, emotionally (the wake of a failed marriage) and apparently physically (the song "allergies") -- though Simon didn't let these obstacles stop him from writing great music.When Hearts and Bones is good, it is very, very good. The Rhino remastered CD is recommended for its sound quality. The extra bonus tracks are nothing to write home about. The earlier CD release without the bonus tracks would also be a good choice.

I'm surprised at some of the negative comments on this album. This is a solid effort. It may not reach the heights of songwriting found on his previous "Life Between the Wars," but the entire album is enjoyable. Honestly, many of the songs have virtually nothing to do with wine -- merely a wine reference here or there. The great thing about Al is that his songs are intelligent songs for intelligent people (you might even learn a thing or two about history), and also he knows how to write a melody, unlike so many of today's writers.The production is fine -- not overdone, not underdone. (I thought Life Between the Wars was too spartan, too underproduced.) The recording is not as clean and clear as it should be. As an audiophile, that irks me.And finally, one must mention price. At $30, I find it hard to recommend this to the average Joe. I guess it depends on how much disposable income you've got. It is criminal that no domestic label will pick up Al's late 1980's and 1990's albums and distribute them. Still, this is a beautiful record, and if you love Al, you've gotta have it, in spite of the cost.

Overall, Life In The Shade is a step forward from Brookville's previous CD, Wonderfully Nothing. Although Brookville's debut hit some very high points in songs like Summer Parade and This Is How It Ends, it was a little uneven.Life In The Shade shows progress in almost every way. The songwriting is consistently good (except for the final two tracks, which never took for me). The production is better -- there were spots in Wonderfully Nothing that I thought were a little threadbare, and could use some sweetening. On Life In The Shade, Brookville knows when to add lushness and complexity, and they know when to lay back and let simplicity reign.Most importantly, they know how to add drama and tension. So many bands I hear start out a song and continue at the same volume with the same instrumentation, grinding away without relief for four or five minutes. Brookville songs ebb and flow, build up and release, with a sense of intelligence -- a sense that the producers and mixers know how to communicate feeling to the listener with sonic variety, instead of monotony.If you haven't heard Brookvillle, the following references might give you an idea of their sound. Andy Chase, the lead vocalist and chief songwriter, sounds perhaps like Art Garfunkel with a little less breathiness, a little more body. The songs have melodies and conventional rhythms. The lyrics are evocative, but not too concrete. A variety of acoustic and electric guitars and keyboards flesh out these tracks, and repeated listenings will reveal small embellishments, tricky little parts inserted here or there at a reduced level in the mix, adding texture and balance. Styles range from pop-rock to bossa nova. Most of the songs are mid-tempo, and the songs can be a little sad. Nothing edgy here, at least in the indie sense. For me, that's a good thing. Gone are the experimental electronic instrumentals which made up half of the first album.This is a classy record. In a world of pop music that has moved increasingly toward simplicity, beat, and vulgarity, Brookville follows the course of restraint, melody, subtlety, and a little sentimentality. Probably a major label would have absolutely no use for this. So give Andy Chase credit. He started his own independent label, he co-owns a studio with Ivy bandmate Adam Schlesinger, and he can release whatever he deems worthwhile. The catalog number here is Unfiltered Records UNF-009. Other Unfiltered releases include the fantastic first EP and first two full length albums from Ivy. Let's hope for more quality from this little label, to entertain us as the four multinational music conglomerates concentrate on the lowest common denominator. Brookville certainly entertains, Life In The Shade is worthy of repeated listens, and honestly these guys should be producing other major musical acts. If I ruled the world, they would be.

I almost gave up on this 90-minute film halfway through. I saw generally where it was going, and I thought the road there would be rather ordinary. It was more than ordinary.Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is a household servant whose employers never seem to measure up to her standards. And vice versa. Her employment agency has given up on her and she is about to be on the streets. But she finagles herself a job as "social secretary" to an aspiring actress. Said actress is trying to sleep her way to the top, with all the entaglements that entails, including rebuffing a man who is her true love. Miss Pettigrew, seemingly wholly out of her element, seems to rise to the occasion, helping straighten out the actress's personal life and introducing a new dimension to her own personal and professional life.The movie is set in England on the verge of WWII. The music is authentic big band-era fare. The scenes are played with a light touch, never completely farcical, but often bordering on it. McDormand is excellent, as usual, as Pettigrew. McDormand is one of the most winning, genuine talents in the movies, and in lesser hands this movie could have been a dud.To be fair, I must question the character development. The Miss Pettigrew at the end of the film has undergone a change which is not believable in the span of roughly 18 hours that the action covers. This is an inconsistency, but the film is rewarding in spite of it. I thought the film was going to be a one-note comedy about offending the sensibilities of the preacher's daughter Pettigrew. But she "loosens up" so quickly, by the end of the film it might seem as if she'd be shocked by nothing.Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day is superb light entertainment. It is worthwhile for McDormand's performance alone. This is a movie to watch when you want to relax and escape the cares of the world.

Ben Stein narrates and stars in Expelled, and the script represents his thoughts. That makes it personal and easy to relate to. The editing is tight, the tone is generally light, and points are illustrated with very amusing (sometimes very literal) old black-and-white newsreel or movie footage driving the idea home. This is a very hip movie, stylistically. But some may consider the subject matter very uncool. The film may get high points on style, but what about the substance?I believe much of the criticism of Expelled is quite misplaced. The purpose of the documentary was not to delve into the scientific support for the intelligent design (ID) hypothesis. The theme here is freedom of thought and speech. Is it possible for an academic to discuss the evidence of biology, biochemistry, genetics, paleontology, physics, cosmology with reference to the possibility of intelligent design in some features of the natural world? The answer appears to be no. Not if you want to keep your job, make tenure, continue to get research grants, and avoid persecution and belittling criticism from powerful academic forces.The question posed is not whether the factual evidence favors intelligent design or unguided, random, natural forces. The question is whether one is allowed to present any argument or evidence in favor of design, or to discuss possible flaws or failings in current evolutionary theory.Have our universities become intolerant of free discussion? Has modern science put blinders on when it comes to anything that might hint of the influence of a higher power or an outside intelligence? Ultra-atheist Richard Dawkins sort of gives away the show at the end. Ben Stein leads Dawkins into a marvelous trap, and Dawkins cannot see that he has defeated his own argument. Dawkins literally admits the possibility of ID, and as long as God isn't involved, he'd be cool with it. This is the same stance as the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Francis Crick who proposed that life was seeded on earth from outer space, possibly from an alien intelligence. Intelligent design by any other name would be as intelligent and as much designed. The subtitle of the movie is "No Intelligence Allowed." But what's really meant is that no possibility of a divine involvement in the mechanical world will even be considered by the academic gatekeepers.Within the limits of the subject -- academic freedom to discuss possible design features of the natural world -- the film is a brilliant success. Yes, it is biased. But if there is a bias, let it be in favor of free speech. If ID is truly a nutty idea, let it be exposed for what it is -- in open debate. That's what Ben Stein's vision of America would allow for, and I believe that matches the desires of a majority of Americans.The party line among the scientific establishment is that ID is merely creationism slyly repackaged. The party line is that evolution is a fact. We don't argue about whether gravity exists, and we don't tolerate classroom discussion of whether or not objects fall toward a massive body. Therefore ID in the classroom is out of the question. And yet, the actual case for Darwin seems to be so weak that science textbooks must resort to misdirection, distortion, and even fraud to indoctrinate students in that theory -- see Jonathan Wells' book Icons of Evolution for proof. On the other hand, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that complex systems like a bacterial flagellum or the light gathering function of the retina of the human eye can be formed by random mutations and natural selection. Such a demonstration has not really been attempted in the scientific literature. Most of the body plans of the species alive today on the earth appear in the fossil record in the short span of about 5 or 10 million years during the Cambrian period (500 million years ago). Most of these body plans do not have any obvious ancestors in the fossils preceding them. The "science" of Darwinism is much shakier than most people imagine. These are legitimate scientific questions. That is a subject for another film, a film I hope that Ben Stein will be willing to undertake now that Expelled has become one of the top 20 documentaries in history.Science is not a dispassionate arena of pure fact. The scientific establishment and the government behemoth that funds it are not immune to fads and biases. Darwinism is the fad of the 20th century, but it's looking more and more ragged around the edges as discoveries in genetics, biochemistry, and paleontology begin to mount. If we want our students to be truly educated -- to see the world as it really is, not as those with philosophical axes to grind would have us see it -- then there must be open debate. Scientists and professors need to be able to voice non-mainstream concerns without it leading to professional suicide. That's what we've got today. It's not the way of freedom, it is not the path to truth, and it's not American.

Musically, Traffic and Weather is tuneful, punchy, and tight. Possibly it veers too much into the melancholy on some songs. I like my FoW a bit more flippant and comical. Lyrics are the main downfall. Planet of Weed goes nowhere. Michael and Heather is so sparse with words that it's completely ambiguous. Revolving Dora is a title too clever by half, but the song proves the band know their old Beatles sound effects very well.The band really rocked Conan O'Brien's show with a big band performance of Strapped for Cash, and the album version here is very good too. The best songs are placed early in the track sequence of Traffic and Weather. My interest waned in the second half.It's all good, but not quite good enough, given the level we had come to expect from Interstate Managers and Utopia Parkway. Newcomers to the band should probably start with those discs, which hardly had a track on them even approaching mediocre.

Sheryl Crow on occasion can move me and make me believe she really believes what she's singing. Unfortunately it is a rare occasion. Some of her more playful work -- Soak Up the Sun, All I Want To Do, Every Day Is A Winding Road -- I find genuinely appealing because it does seem genuine and witty. On the somber side -- Safe And Sound, I Will Believe, even Weather Channel -- Sheryl can move me and sell the lyric.So much for past glories. On the new record, Wildflower, we have a new level of perfection in production, melodies and arrangements. Everything is just a little too glossy. But unfortunately we don't find wit or heart in these lyrics. Even if Sheryl could sell this material, there's nothing to sell. Like a pop automaton, Sheryl Crow-bot soldiers on as if there was any *there* there. The lyrics are trite blah-blah.I Know Why might actually be a real song, not just an amazing simulation. I'm not sure yet. I'm still trying to figure out if it means anything. At least while I'm struggling with that question, the music is gorgeous. I am nearly convinced on that basis alone. There's even a banjo. Yee haw!One beautiful song does not an album make. The rest is pretty sonic wallpaper -- pop/rock with a bit of country flavor. The songs chug along like a slow-burn Neil Young rocker, but with more finesse.For some reason I'm attracted to the album graphics -- I think I detect influences of Roger Dean's Yes album covers, some sixties-style psychedelia a la Yellow Submarine, but very dark and subdued in color and mood. It makes me long for the days of vinyl 12" album covers where you could actually see details. CD art is like Polaroid snapshots. boo hiss.It mostly comes down to expectations. Sheryl's previous studio album showed signs of artistic growth, and I was hoping that growth would continue. Hopes dashed. This is by-the-numbers. Another master tape off the assembly line of the corporate music machine. Not that there's anything *wrong* with that. Just be careful -- listen to this CD somewhere before you actually shell out money to buy it.

I won't ruin things with a spoiler, but in my opinion the film is building up to something, and the ending simply opens up more questions than it solves. As for the preceding hour and forty-five minutes, it moves at a deathly slow pace most of the time. The camera lingers on people who are doing little but staring or moving slowly as if drugged. This could be helped with editing, but even so, I wonder if a story about a man's life unraveling (almost) due to forces he cannot understand can be made into high entertainment without some sort of payoff. There is very little payoff.Good points? The dialog is well-written and well-acted. But the movie is poorly paced, and in my opinion poorly plotted. I certainly have some sympathy for what the man (and his family) goes through. In the end, it's not enough.

I had heard several songs from this album over the past few months, but today I got the CD in the mail. Inara George and her co-writers and collaborating musicians have done some very meticulous work here. Inara's voice is sweet, solid, and always in tune. She can convey irony, sadness, humor with the slightest subtle inflection here or there -- she doesn't have to resort to screeching, bellowing, or moaning, or that bane of modern pop music -- melisma. (Bleah!)What are these songs about? It isn't always so clear. To me, a bit of ambiguity and subtlety is a good thing, because it leaves room for a listener's interpretations. I suppose you could say these songs are sketches of the landscape of the heart. That'll suffice for a general idea.I like the production. It isn't overproduced or underproduced. Fools in Love is carried mostly with guitar and voice, but listen carefully for subtle additions of bass and electric guitar to flesh things out. The same goes for Fools Work. Drums and bass are present on the up-tempo numbers, of which there are few. Delicate keyboards on songs like Good To Me bring to mind the harpsichords on Beatles songs like In My Life and Fixing A Hole. The point is, the soundscape is rich, but not cluttered.Finally I want to complement the musical structure of the songs themselves. I hear so many songs that are so musically lightweight that I feel after hearing them once there is nothing more to be gained by a second listen. On All Rise, I want to listen repeatedly to hear the unexpected chord changes, and the way the songs are structured. (As I am constantly amazed at the chord progression in Inara's song Again And Again from her work on The Bird And The Bee album -- entrancing.) There's a lot of creativity in these compositions, to my way of thinking.

I want to like Madeleine Peyroux. I've heard some of her live radio performances that really touched me. On the album cuts I've heard so far, she seems a little restrained by comparison, a bit less spontaneous.She sounds like Billie Holiday, I guess. I am not a Holiday fan, so frankly I could care less. It is a non-issue. Madeleine is not trying to ape Holiday, I am convinced. That is just the way she naturally sings.The problem I find with this album is that it is uneven. Getting Some Fun Out Of Life, which is an obvious example of her Billie Holiday sound-alike-ness, is a fetching little song. And La Vie En Rose is beautiful. Some of the arrangements on the other tracks are so corny, they're like something you'd hear coming from the public bandshell at the Iowa State Fair.All I can say is that this was her first record. I didn't even care for the first Beatles album that much. So she's grown a lot in ten years. Today her song choices are better and her arrangements more refined. There are some gems here but choose wisely. Maybe download selected tracks you want. I know I'm glad I did not buy this. At its best, it is a promise of better things to come. At worst, it is a little embarrassing.

Unlike so many great songwriters who mellow in middle age and peter out, Al Stewart continues making occasional but brilliant albums which critics and the public largely ignore. This album showcases a bunch of great and a few merely good songs, played mostly by Al and guitarist Lawrence Juber with drums and bass and soloists added sparingly. I read in an interview with Juber (if memory serves) that half the songs on the album are merely remixed versions of the demo tracks that he and Al made prior to the main recording sessions. This is not a bad thing, though the sound quality of this album is surely a notch or two below the big hit albums that Stewart recorded with Alan Parsons. On the whole, I'd say that the songs may be a tad underproduced -- these beautiful songs actually deserve sweetening with string sections or maybe a full band with keyboards, saxophone, and the whole shebang. Did one reviewer say that the opening track, Night Train to Munich, was &quot;rockin'&quot;? Hardly. It has more in common with Django Reinhardt than rock music. This is intelligent pop with a bit of a chamber jazz feel to it. Rock, it is not. Rock, it does not. Al's memorable words and melodies are beautiful, as ever.Al Stewart has problems with record companies. A jinx perhaps. He releases albums and they are not promoted. His last two record companies went out of business and the records go out of print. His latest album is only available on EMI import at great cost. I find it hard to justify the high cost of this CD, purchased as used rarity. But it is a far better record than lots of others that people are paying high prices for. If you have the money and you want the best pop music in the world, go for it! This is the genuine article.

After years of success in the folk-pop genre with Garfunkel and his own solo career, Paul Simon decided to get into acting. Bad move. I saw One Trick Pony in the theater and on video. As a movie, despite some very nice little scenes and live performances, it drags. Honestly, it is a little depressing.However, the songs written for the movie are another matter entirely. Paul Simon took some study in musical composition, and this began to bear fruit in Still Crazy After All These Years and One Trick Pony. Everything here is pop music at the highest level, tinged with a bit of jazz -- the presence of jazz guitarist Eric Gale and keyboardist Richard Tee, the ultra-clean and always innovative drumming of Steve Gadd are an essential part of the superb mix. But the songs are heavenly, melodic, meaningful, poetic, mostly meditative, and well-crafted.I'd have to say this is my favorite Paul Simon album. Others come close -- Still Crazy, and Rhythm of the Saints. I find this one the most consistent and most worthy of repeated listening. (Not counting the bonus tracks, which may be nice to have, but do not fit in with the original album as a whole. Most of the time you'll want to skip the bonus cuts.)

There's a lot of rating inflation on amazon, IMO. I don't know that I can add much to all the "wonderfall" reviews written so far. Mostly I wanted to add my five stars to so many of the others.Rarely is any episodic TV show so consistently well-written. (Even Firefly had an embarrassingly poor episode about an interstellar whorehouse.) The writing would be for naught without great actors. I have some doubts about the African-American character -- I thought she tended to overplay her lines just a bit. But the rest were absolutely the best performances imaginable, making the absurd premise believable. The comedy does not strictly come from the dialogue itself. It comes from the fact that these lines perfectly fit the characters who speak them. The natural interaction between these well-drawn (if quirky) characters is the main source of the humor.I believe the Joan of Arcadia comparisons are apt. However, Joan was a dramatic program, and Wonderfalls is much more comedic, whimsical. They were both great shows, killed before their time by network stupidity.The Canadian woman who plays Jaye is impressive, and she would be a much better choice for many comedic roles than the famous American actresses who get those parts. It is just not fair that this talent is not a household name. She absolutely carried the show on her shoulders. Bravo!Fortunately my library bought this series, otherwise I would never have known the show even existed. Now I am looking to buy a copy of my own. My hat is off to all involved in the show for making so many viewers' lives a little cheerier.

It may be unfortunate that I discovered Cocteau Twins later work first. It was somewhat disappointing for me to look back to their earlier work, to find that the first half of their career had a much more primitive and less accessible quality. When they finally got more commercial-sounding, they started making some fine-sounding -- and always distinctive -- music.This set documents the earlier part of their career. I am far from an expert on the band, but even a relative novice can hear the musical development. The first and earliest releases on disc one have thrumming tribal beats, simplistic and slightly discordant interplay between bass and tricked-out guitars, with Liz Fraser's somewhat feral swooping and warbling and wailing vocalizations flying over the top of the swirling grunge.Next, they began to find better melodies and get the backup more harmonically organized. The songs still tended to lack for variation and invention, but things were improving. They weren't traditional songs, per se, and perhaps their most dedicated fans like them that way. I think they succeed more in establishing a mood and a trance-like or hypnotic impulse than in communicating a coherently developed musical construction.At some point Elizabeth's singing developed more sweetness and lilting inflections (melisma) like popular Indian vocalists. The song structures became more confident and normalized -- Iceblink Luck on the second disc is an example of this progression. Of course the "lyrics" were, and continued to be, unintelligable nonsense for the most part. But with the added sweetness and melody one didn't care so much.From this point, improvements in the band consisted of refining their formula. That refinement is evident on their later albums and singles, represented on volume two of the Lullabies set. I much prefer the fully developed Cocteau Twins music and production we hear on Heaven Or Las Vegas and Milk And Kisses. For me, music can rarely succeed on beat and trance and texture alone, it must have melody and a structure that allows for some tension and release. I'm sure Cocteau Twins fans love the whole body of work, but if you have standards similar to mine, you will find much more to like on volume 2.In my estimation, Volume One is only a developmental sonic history of how Cocteau Twins learned to play and sing well enough to reach their full potential in their latter years.

Moan, moan, b*tch, whine, whine. It's all too much, as the Beatles sang. I read this book once, a few years ago. Harlan thinks he is making a great case for himself, but in his much speaking, his heart is revealed -- he simply doesn't seem to have understood that he was hired to create a script that fits within the pre-established context of an episodic television series, and was beholden to the vision of its creator, Gene Roddenberry.He's like Ayn Rand's Howard Roarke who wants to take other people's money and use it to build his own vision of a building instead. No, Harlan, you should dance with the guy who brung ya. Roddenberry paid for a script that fit HIS specifications.City on the Edge of Forever was one of the great Star Trek episodes, and reading Harlan's "ideal" version of it is of great interest. As a standalone motion picture, it would have been great. The problem is, he took liberties with the characters and story that simply wouldn't fit the Star Trek series.As I recall, in the end of the book it is revealed that D.C. Fontana re-wrote the script that was eventually filmed. If that is true, then praises for D.C. Fontana. I love Harlan's script, and I love the final TV episode that was filmed. I just don't think all the fuss about the rewrite is justified. It was rewritten, and it should have been rewritten. Harlan, if he wasn't such an egonmaniacal little twit, could have done the rewrite properly himself, had he wanted to. He just didn't want to. His loss, because to my mind, D.C. Fontana deserves as much credit as Harlan for one of the top ten episodes of the pioneering TV show Star Trek (The Original Series).Harlan Ellison is a great writer. I do not debate that. But it is much better to read his fiction than his endless crabbing about these incidents that happened nearly forty years ago. It matters less than the dust on the balance now.

In 2002 a concert was arranged at the Royal Albert Hall as a tribute to George Harrison. These tribute concerts usually don't excite me, but our library bought it, so I had to try it.If you like Harrison's music at all, I would recommend this DVD. The first 40 minutes are taken up with an introduction of the concert by Eric Clapton, introduction of Ravi Shankar, and Ravi's composition for the occasion, a three part affair titled "Arpan" -- the first part was a raga performed by Ravi's daughter Anushka (also Norah Jones' half-sister) on sitar. Second was one of George's songs performed by Jeff Lynne, and third, a symphonic piece that went on a bit too long, but was still fun to watch -- many different Indian instruments and players. I could not have listened to it for that long, as it did not have a strong melody, but when you can watch all the performers doing their thing, it is not tedious.Next came a bawdy song by Monty Python followed by Michael Palin singing the Lumberjack Song. (George Harrison had business associations with Python, and was of course a fan.)The remaining 90-minute section featured a large rock band fronted by different spotlight singers performing songs mostly by George Harrison. The band was very hot. One might even suggest that the performances were better than the original backing bands on Harrison's albums.Billy Preston sang a song or two. There were at least two singers I did not know, including a powerful vocalist who put a lot of life into one of Harrison's last songs, Horse To The Water. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed Taxman with exceptional verve. I was amazed. Ringo Starr sang Photograph and a Carl Perkins song. I thought his performance was a little too loose and offhand, but all in good fun. McCartney came to the stage next, and he almost looked like he did not want to be there. I don't know the why. Face it, he could not decline to attend this, but maybe had good reasons for not wanting to be there -- perhaps he was just very sad. Still, he sang All Things Must Pass with feeling, just what was needed. Paul sang two other songs.Clapton naturally performed While My Guitar Gently Weeps. In my opinion his singing of it was better than his soloing. He would have done better just to copy the solo on the record. (However I am not a huge fan of Clapton's guitar playing, so I was not disappointed.) Jeff Lynne sang another one, but I don't remember what it was. I do have two ELO albums from back when, and let me say that Jeff Lynne is a much better singer now than before. I enjoyed his contributions.All in all, the performances were great, and the backing band was fantastic. I won't buy it, as it doesn't have much replay value for me. But I am glad I saw it. The only thing missing was Yoko coming to sing something. But that's another plus.Why four stars and not five? A little too much of the Shankar composition for my taste, for one thing, and because it is not Harrison singing these great and cherished tunes, so it can never reach its full potential. George, we loved you.

Our first Stir Crazy lasted 20 years. We decided to retire it, and the replacement that arrived had a chip in the plastic rim around the base, exposing the metal cooking plate. Back to amazon for sample number two. This was cosmetically/functionally fine. With light use -- perhaps once every two weeks -- the machine has lasted perhaps three years, and now the stirring rod turns but the heating element no longer heats. Useless.I don't see a good alternative but to order another one, but these cheap foreign-made items appear to be more expensive in the long run than well-made domestic ones. As Sting said, "When the world is running down, you make the best of what's still around." The name brands no longer offer the quality they used to, but other options are hard to find. I would be willing to pay more for something durable.I am very disappointed. But while it lasted, the popcorn was good.

An interesting show. But for 10 episodes on one disc -- that means heavy compression -- at $29 list it is too expensive. [Commenter Blue Coronet points out that the amazon.com listing is wrong. It is not a double-sided single disc, there are two DVDs in the set. This however does not change my opinion. Five episodes per disc is not an optimum video bitrate. Let's face it. They were too cheap to put the series on three DVDs.]Maybe some of the characters were a little too kooky just for the sake of kookiness. Maybe if it had continued, it might have spun out of control, jumped the shark rather early. However, it is nice to see a cop show that isn't as formulaic as most. It had potential.Definitely worth a rental, though, if you like offbeat drama-comedy.

After hearing his Author Unknown CD, I thought Jason Falkner was someone who could channel the music of the spheres. I was a little let down by Can You Still Feel, but there was plenty of good work there. After all this time, JF ekes out a five-song EP, and honestly I'm disappointed again.I like The Neighbor and Feeling No Pain. Lost Myself revs itself up nicely toward the end. I cannot fault any of this musically. The power pop punch JF mastered on previous albums is here, but I don't find much of the lyrical cleverness of Author Unknown here. They Put Her In the Movies and Moving Up seemed terribly simplistic to me. I am beginning to think Jason needs a collaborator to write words, leaving the musical composition to his classically trained brain.Don't take my word for it. Here's one chorus:"Cuz I want youAnd everybody wants you tooWhat am I supposedTo do?"An embarrassing rhyme. Here's another one:"But I lost myself in yoo-oo.Yes I lost myself in youOh I lost myself in youNow I know what I should do."OK, I'm rolling my eyes now. What are we, back in high school?Plus, maybe he could write about something other than girls? I like girls too. But maybe get Al Stewart to write some historical lyrics Jason could set to music. NOW we're talking.Every once in a while you have to buy a CD on faith. Why? Because it will probably convince you of the wisdom of hearing an album first, to see if it is worthwhile to purchase. This EP was another lesson for me.You may love every second of Bliss Descending. I don't. Author Unknown reeks of greatness. Bliss Descending is several steps down from that: two hits and three duds.

Certainly this is nothing in-depth, and yet it is packed full of information, and written with a light, easy-to-read touch. The title refers to how Irish monks preserved the classical texts of Greece and Rome while most of Europe entered the Dark Ages and much was destroyed on the continent. It is a nice little primer on history, pre-Saint Patrick as well -- actually, the pre-Patrick history, setting the stage for Patrick and his followers and their religious and scholarly pursuits takes up over half the book. I read it aloud to my mother, and I enjoyed the way the sentences flow so easily. I wish I could write so artfully. Yes, it is history, but it borders on literature. I believe I will seek out this author's other books.

A very nice chill-out album. Put the headphones on, let the sound wash over you, and the mental images form: Peaceful islands, cathedrals, vast plains, the gentle rocking of a railroad car. It's virtually all melodic, and everything emerges from a warm cloud of reverberation. Vocals, when present, are of the Cocteau Twins school -- you know they're singing, but you can't usually make out what words or languages the vocalist is using.While the music is relaxing, I also find it emotionally uplifting, even hopeful. Beats drive the music forward, but percussion is not out front. This is sort of the antithesis of the clickety-klunky school of techno. This music is pretty, warm, and inviting. Medusa is the toughest piece on the record, sounding more rhythmic, vaguely discordant, slightly distorted, but still hanging onto its harmonic underpinning. I found all the other cuts quite relaxing.It's hard to compare Ulrich Schnauss' work on Goodbye to any other band. It almost defines its own genre. It may or may not be to your liking. Listen to samples or whole tracks somewhere, like Ulrich's Myspace page. Hopefully you will like it, and buy it. I did. Very solid throughout. Four stars, well-deserved. It's not at all related to the music I usually buy: jazz, singer-songwriter folk-pop, progressive rock, classical. Finding this new, different music was a pleasant surprise.

Meet me at the bottom... sings Bob Dylan in Workingman's Blues #2. Certainly this is not the bottom, not the worst of Dylan's albums. That would arguably be Down in the Groove. (Another deliberately ironic title?)Still, listening to Modern Times brings to mind the story about the dancing bear. The amazing thing about a dancing bear is not that it dances well, but that it can dance on its hind feet at all. Bob Dylan is the old bear who is, contrary to reasonable expectation, still dancing. He's still selling records and still a hugely profitable force on tour after all these decades. So, one is tempted to review Modern Times as an amazing feat. Comparing it to his early work, or to the work of artists who are still vital creative forces, it is pretty ordinary.Modern Times is certainly ordinary in the musical sense. The band sounds like a crack country-rock outfit. As with many other Dylan albums, the arrangements seem slapdash, as if Bob handed them a lyric sheet with chords printed on it about five minutes before recording. Then Dylan sets the tempo, the band fires up, and they fake their way through the set. I know nothing of producer Jack Frost (wink, wink), but he seems to have exerted almost no attempt to infuse the music with the structure and drama that one finds on Dylan's Infidels (produced by Mark Knopfler) or Oh Mercy (produced by Daniel Lanois). What we get are typical country blues, typical country-rock shuffle, typical old-time country waltzes and ballads, typical melodies, typical guitar solos. Beyond The Horizon wouldn't seem out of place on a Leon Redbone album.The blandness of the accompaniment would be nothing to quibble over if the lyrical content was as brilliant as we know Bob Dylan can sometimes be. But we see the barest flashes of clever wordplay here. Mostly we must be content with silly stuff like, "I got troubles so hard, I just can't stand the strain. Some mean old lazy slut has charmed away my brains." Then again, Fire on the Mountain isn't bad. But isn't it almost insulting for Dylan, one of the richest "song and dance men" in show business, singing the workingman's blues? Yeah, Bob. A hard rain's gonna fall, but the people out here in the cheap seats won't be meeting YOU at the bottom.Dylan strikes out at greed, violence, disaster. Evoking the apocalypse, the judgment, the end of the road, but also the tenderness and balm of love. Dylan has done it all before, and much more coherently and poetically.OK, Dylan does what Dylan does, whether he's making a serious effort or just pulling our leg. He puts it out, and some people will praise it just because it is Bob Dylan, and just because he is a dancing bear, which is amazing in some strange circus-show way. You won't really miss much if you avoid Dylan's post-80s output, the effusive critical praise of Time Out Of Mind notwithstanding. Even that supposed nugget was just painful to listen to, especially compared to the easygoing Love And Theft. Modern Times is easy to take, but there's not enough *there* there. Stick to the old Dylan classics. I'm buying the remastered releases of his best work, and it is a much better investment.

If you enjoyed Mona Bone Jackon, Tea for the Tillerman, and Teaser and the Firecat, great! You should keep listening to and enjoying those wonderful, classic albums. But even before he left his career as Cat Stevens decades ago, Yusef's albums were sounding like the fire had all but died. Face it, they were not the prime focused pop music of his early-mid career.When an artist leaves for so long and comes back, expectations are naturally low, at least for me. A few songs on An Other Cup do recall the magic of the old Cat Stevens. Most of the cuts are just OK, nice, pleasant, sweet. They aren't bad, but I'm not sure they deserve our attention, either.Yusef seems like a cool cat. I can't say anything bad about this album. That doesn't mean it couldn't be a lot better. The energy level needs to be kicked up a notch, for one thing. One of Cat's best songs, The Wind, is less than two minutes long. Some lesser songs on An Other Cup run four to five minutes and honestly, they drag a bit. I still feel I get more entertainment or whatever other benefits I get from music by listening to one of Cat's three or four classic records again.If hearing something NEW is more important to you than hearing something GREAT, then buy this CD. For me, newness is not justification of itself. (And not all of the music here is brand new, either.)

I can't predict whether you will love this album. I own all of Gordon's albums except If You Could Read My Mind and Summer Side of Life. I know my Lightfoot.His last three studio albums, including Harmony, have been a little disappointing to me. His voice has changed over the years, but that doesn't bother me. Even on Harmony, some of the songs are sung with conviction, and the on two live cuts (Shellfish, The No Hotel), his voice is fairly strong. On other cuts, he seems a little tentative. If I read the liner notes correctly, these tracks were originally demos with just Lightfoot singing and playing guitar. The album was constructed by the band overdubbing their instruments along with those demo tracks while Gordon was in the hospital recovering from his aneurism. Perhaps that is the source of the tentativeness I detect at times -- that they are sourced in demo recordings.I truly loved the poetry and chord structure of River of Light. Perhaps others can get more out of the lyrics of the other tunes than I did, but for me they don't hold up to the great work he's done in the past: Don Quixote, Tatoo, Edmund Fitzgerald, etc. Also, he seems to have lost the knack of writing a powerful musical hook. There's nothing wrong with these songs, and they certainly seem sincere. I hate to say they are a bit boring, but that's how most of them strike me.I'm glad that Gordon survived the health crisis that happened concurrent with the production of this album. He's been touring, too. I would love to be able to say that his creative powers are still as strong as they were in the 70s and 80s but I honestly can't. I would advise the prospective purchaser to complete his or her collection of Gordon's catalog from that era before moving on to these late-period works. If your expectations aren't too high, perhaps you will find this album a pleasant listen.

I am reviewing the DVD release, so I won't comment on Blu-Ray picture quality. As noted by others, the changes to the original film are not earth-shattering, and they aren't all improvements.New computer generated 3D animation is substituted for some of the old cell animation. But the transitions are jarring. The change is hard to justify. The old animation was good, and the style was more or less consistent.I personally think the English dubbing should have been re-done. Just something about the Major's voice has always been a little too deadpan. But basically the same old voice tracks are used.The color of the whole film is shifted toward sepia. Everything is more washed-out and more brown than before. It doesn't look good to me.I bought the 12" laserdisc of GITS when it came out. The first DVD release of GITS was quite good. Maybe you will prefer 2.0, but for me it is change for change's sake. The film is worth multiple viewings, but I'll stick with 1.0, thank you.

I have been entertained by Diana Krall's past work, but this record is the first thing she's done that actually *moved* me. I thought of DK as an &quot;ice queen,&quot; and her vocals on the syrupy Look of Love CD bordered on the phoned-in. But this... Diana, I didn't know you had it in you. Wow!And I am baffled why those who have enjoyed her music in the past feel so betrayed. All her former attributes are here in strength, her graceful playing and singing, but with the added depth of emotional communication. What's not to like? Not jazzy enough? This is jazzier than Look of Love.When I saw Krall perform Narrow Daylight on the Today show, I confess I did think of Norah Jones, but listening to other songs from this collection, I completely forgot about Norah. Elvis Costello's songs sound much better with Diana singing them, and the covers she chose add a great variety.In her voice I hear the magic of love and the tragedy of loss. I wish her the greatest happiness, and I hope that she and Elvis can make their love last. Not only for their sakes, but for mine -- I am looking forward to more records like this! Every aspect of this production, from the writing, arranging, engineering, singing and phrasing, is at the peak of the art. I wouldn't say I'm in awe, but almost.Please, at least give The Girl in the Other Room a listen, give it a chance. Art this good deserves at least that much.

In the olden days, to remix an album meant creating a new mix from the master tapes that sounded close to the original, but with minor changes in instrumental balance, equalization, and greater clarity.Today, a remix usually means taking pieces of the original tracks (discarding others), looping and combining them with new beats, synth tracks and backing instruments. Increasingly this means messing with the harmonic structure of the song -- i.e. the chords behind a vocal melody in a remix may be quite different than the original mix. This at times produces interesting results, but some remixers have a bit of a tin ear and create a bit of dissonance or at least a weird combination as new and old instrumental lines are combined with vocals. In my experience, remixing usually leads to, at best, an interesting variation. Rarely does a remix come out better than the original, and very often it is less interesting, even ugly.There are different remix artists for each of the 13 Tanto Tempo Remix album tracks. Pardon the pun, but the results are mixed, to say the least.The first track BANANEIRA, fares well, retaining many elements of the original, including harmonies, chord structure, and horn section. The opening rhythmic bum - bum - BUM chord repeats with beats that change the feel of the song -- more jazz/rock/funk and less Sergio Mendez. Very listenable and dance-worthy.Track 2, SEM CONTENCAO, uses a tribal percussion and disco beat to propel nylon string guitar, Deodato-like electric piano, and Bebel's beautiful (if repetitious) multi-tracked vocals and harmonies. Energetic and fun, but goes on about two minutes too long. This remix does not match the "Brasil 2mil" mix from the Tanto Tempo Japanese import, but is good in its own right.AUGUST DAY SONG is a restful, beautiful favorite from the original CD. This Chateau Flight remix is too electronic and synthesizer-y for my taste. In addition the new chords do not work as harmoniously with the old melody line. Interesting, but not that appealing.TANTO TEMPO is another dreamy cut that's been computerized to death on the remix. Kraftwerk meets bossa nova? Not a great combo. A somber piano enters midway through the remix, but with the synths and beats blurping in the background, there's no chance for its beauty to emerge. Fail.Track 5, MAIS FELIZ, strips down the original tracks to primarily vocals. Drum machine and synth bass, nylon stringed guitar, electronic bloops and bleeps, arpeggio harp runs, and a muted vocal choir create a unique and unusual juxtaposition. Some might call it an unnatural mix.Mario Caldato Jr.'s remix of SO NICE (Summer Samba) is brighter and more appealing, because it hews closer to the original mix, except that the vocals are squeezed toward the midrange, sounding a bit like Bebel is singing through a megaphone. In addition there are what sound like sci-fi movie sound effects dropped in here and there, lending an otherworldly character to the sonic background.The Ananda Project remix of ALGUEM is very smooth and invigorating. It's a near total remake of the track, using the vocals (rearranged and reprocessed), but creating a basic beat with a very funky bass line and keyboards to flesh out the track. There aren't too many songs that can succeed using only a single chord. Harry Nilsson's hit song Coconut comes to mind as a standout. Ananda's ALGUEM is not that kind of a classic, but I'll give it credit for holding my interest in spite of never changing chord or key.Track 8 is another version of SEM CONTENCAO. It may be equal or superior to the original album track, beefing up the rhythmic elements, also adding a nylon-string guitar solo to break up the monotony.The next four tracks, CLOSE YOUR EYES, Da Lata's remix of AUGUST DAY SONG, Chari Chari's TANTO TEMPO, and SAMBA DA BENCAO, take more liberties with the mix and are more repetitious. If you approach this album as a fan of electronica and ambient music, you will find more to like in these tracks than someone approaching this album as a fan of bossa nova. (That observation might apply to some degree to a few other tracks on this album as well.) I could listen through these four cuts once, but I would not be compelled to revisit them.The final cut, King Britt remix of AUGUST DAY SONG, merely strips things down to guitar and vocals, then adds a hip-hop percussion beat and a violin solo. Sort of a low-key send-off for this album.These remixes tend to be more suited to dance clubs, with a greater emphasis on beat and trance, less emphasis on melody and that syncopated bossa nova beat. It all depends on what you like. Personally I prefer the original Tanto Tempo. I enjoyed these variations, but they won't be replayed nearly as often. It earns an overall rating of 3 1/2 stars. Some listenable songs, some good attempts, some very good ones.

Aimee's first live CD/DVD project is a gift to fans who cannot attend one of her concerts, or who want to repeat their concert experience. I believe Live at St. Anne's must accurately document what an Aimee Mann show is like on a good night. This set is a bargain -- for the price of a CD you get a live CD and a DVD you can enjoy any time.The word that keeps coming to mind when I think about the program is professional. Aimee's songs are superbly crafted, and her band gives them just due in these live arrangements. If there is any quality in which this DVD falls short, it would be that the performances are perhaps a bit too cautious at times. The two new songs (from an upcoming album to be titled King of the Jailhouse) sound a bit tired, treading the kind of musical and lyrical ground she has trod many times before, but the rest of the material was top notch.I think Aimee's studio recordings are superior to the versions here. Perhaps arranging the tunes in new and interesting ways, or evidence of more passion in the performances would have made this DVD a standout, worthy of a five star rating. But it was fun just to see Aimee live, and perhaps that alone justifies this live disc.I have a few other minor quibbles. Aimee's acoustic guitar sounds rather unimpressive and ordinary. Surely she can afford an instrument with more sustain and brilliance -- or perhaps it is poorly recorded. Also, her voice tends to be a bit nasal, and this quality is more evident on her live performances than on her studio CDs. There were a few video compression artifacts in this DVD transfer, but overall the picture is excellent (anamorphic widescreen). The sound is also superb. Listening on headphones, I found the stereo mix more detailed and up close, but depending on your audio gear, you might prefer the slightly more laid-back sound of the 5.1 multichannel mix. I don't have surround speakers, so I can't evaluate the ability of that track to create a credible illusion of a concert hall when reproduced as intended. Also, if you try to pick out an individual song on the DVD menu, the edit points are poorly chosen, and you may find that the selection starts a little after the music begins and ends just a little before the last note dies away.There is a special interview feature where Aimee and her band engage in a little mutual admiration, and talk a bit about performing together and being on the road. Unless you are a big fan, skip it.Aimee seemed to be a little stiff in the beginning -- the first songs are very competently played, but I felt that she was a bit detached from the material. She gets more confident as she goes forward, and on Amateur, she proves herself a much better bass player than the guy she hired to do most of the bass work in the band. Aimee really loosens up and starts rocking out on Pavlov's Bell, and from then on she seemed fully invested in her performance.Praises are due her lead guitar player, who probably makes the most impassioned music of all the musicians in the band, although many of his solos seemed based on note-for-note copies of the studio versions. Still, they were well played.If you like Aimee Mann, there is no reason you would not enjoy this concert. On the other hand, if you have her studio recordings, I cannot honestly say you will be missing much if you don't see this DVD. Aimee is a very talented songwriter and a skilled performer. It may be difficult for some of us, because of location, to see her perform live, but this disc affords us an excellent opportunity.I'm not a fan of Aimee's 'Til Tuesday material, but since she went solo, she's written an impressive collection of truly wonderful songs, usually about dysfunctional people and relationships. Each person will obviously have his or her favorites, but this DVD offers a good sample of her solo career (except for the new songs, which I thought were unimpressive). But do buy the studio recordings. That is where Aimee does her best work.

Nothing explosively wonderful here, but I found it an interesting album. It starts out a little slow with the title track -- showing that Summers does not really retain one's interest on long solos. Hackensack, with the benefit of organ and trumpet and cello and everyone getting a little solo turn, is "creatively destructive" of the tune -- and it is fun to hear everything just a bit off kilter and very loose, like Monk's tunes themselves. Summers seems to have an odd sense of humor, and in view of that, I'd say he and Monk are a good match.Summers wisely keeps songs down to a comfortable three to five minute length. Summers has a limited bag of tricks as a guitarist, so best not to push his luck. So many jazz artists sound like they are phoning their performance in, and they know they can fall back on different patterns played with little effort or involvement. To me, it sounds like Andy is working, thinking about what he's playing. Even if it isn't always elegant, I appreciate the efforts of someone who plays something simple, with thought, instead of something complicated and difficult that is thrown off automatically with seemingly no feeling. And Andy Summers knows the value of silence in a line, instead of trying to fill every space with notes.Sting's appearance on Round Midnight is welcome, and even more Andy's slinky solo on that tune. An entire album of Sting singing jazz might be unbearable, but one song is just the ticket here.Probably you don't even want to listen this album all in one sitting. It is nearly an hour long. But it is good for repeated listenings, at least I have found it to be so, even if I listen to a few songs here, a few there.Look, this is far better than Summers' "new age" records -- at least the ones I heard. I don't think he did nearly as well with the next record, where he tackled the Mingus catalog. Undoubtedly Summers' forte is in the power trio setting of the Police. Those who admired that work, which defined a whole new sound in rock music, copied and incorporated into so many other guitarists' styles, should also find this diversion worthwhile.

Sometimes the stars align for a recording date, and something inexplicably perfect and right and synchronous occurs. On the evidence, that appears to have happened when Frank Sinatra, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Claus Ogerman, and a small orchestra assembled one day in a recording studio to play the songs of Jobim and a few other American classic tunes given a similar "bossa nova with strings" re-working.For virtually the entire album, the focus is on softness and controlled intensity, which is very difficult for musicians, especially vocalists and woodwinds. On this stereo remix of the four-track original tape you hear orchestra left, orchestra right (with drum kit). In the middle, slightly to the right, is Frank himself. In the middle, slightly to the left, we hear the constant syncopation of Jobim's nylon-string guitar, and his Portuguese and Portuguese-accented English vocal contributions, which contribute to the atmosphere, but do not markedly steer the spotlight from Sinatra. The instrumental and vocal tone is rich, liquid, with a sense of acoustic space around the instruments. The sound of the strings is sweet, and everything has warm, gorgeous tonal qualities.Also, this is essentially a live-in-the-studio recording. All the musicians were playing and being recorded at the same time. Sinatra was able to truly feed off what his players were doing in the moment. I believe this adds to the holistic "rightness" of the performance. (The vocals on Corcovado have a different sonic character. This vocal just might have been an overdub recorded after the backing tracks, but I cannot say with certainty.)The songs should be known by all lovers of the classic songbook and classic bossa nova. Ogerman's arrangements complement Frank's restrained gliding vocal lines, never calling undue attention to themselves. This is not an album that will make you want to twitch about or jump up and dance (unless it's a slow dance). This album is as distinctly American as Sinatra himself, at the same time incorporating the classic elements of bossa nova, even down to the "happy sadness" of the mood. In other words, the sadness of a song is presented with the lightest touch. That girl from Ipanema, "she just doesn't see, she doesn't see me." But it's a line that makes you smile, thinking that the guy will just sigh and shrug it off, not veer into obsession or depression.Picture yourself on a beach, under the shade of a palm. You have a cool drink. Temperature is a perfect 75. The gentlest of breezes kiss the shore. And this short Sinatra-Jobim album is the soundtrack best fitting that scene. At 28 minutes, it is too short. But would you rather have 50 minutes of mediocre? Or 28 minutes of Sinatra-Jobim perfection?

This film was made on a very large scale, but not quite the epic scale of Lawrence of Arabia. Also, the dialogue is not quite as sharp as David Lean's Lawrence. There's a depth there that's missing here.Still, this is a perfectly good combination of action, history, and political maneuvering. A very enjoyable evening's entertainment.Although Ben-Hur is my favorite film, and Chuck Heston will be best remembered as Moses, I believe Chinese Gordon is one of Heston's best performances on film. He's even better in A Touch of Evil, but very good in Khartoum.This story is tragic, but Gordon's heroism and determination make it seem more triumphant than tragic. As a man of conviction and honor who stood up to Muslim fanatics, even without the support of his government, he stands as a lesson for today. He did not cower in the face of barbarism. He confronted it head on, no matter the personal cost.I don't know how many Disney movies I've watched with the trite theme "Follow Your Heart." "Chinese" Gordon followed his heart. A very large heart it was, loyal to the land and people he loved, to the bitter end.

The virtues of this part of the trilogy are the same as the virtues of the first two parts. Superb acting, visuals, and of course Tolkien's story.However, this last effort had too much action for action's sake. This left less time for in-depth dialogue. The interaction between characters was left to the minimum, lowest common denominator stuff. It is in this film especially that a bigger dose of Tolkien's wordiness would have been welcome. Less action, more talk. I suppose Jackson was unable to resist the temptation to try to compete in spectacle and unrestrained busy-ness with other contemporary action films. Pity. LOTR is so much more than that. Or it should be.Also, the emotional peak of the film is the coronation of the king, and particularly his showing honor to the four hobbits. The two epilogues following this were not necessary. The ending therefore is strung-out to no good purpose.These flaws could be fixed in the directors cut, but I doubt they will be. If Return of the King could be made more like Fellowship of the Ring, then this trilogy would be an unqualified success, and I would pronounce it the greatest epic film ever made. But they dropped the ball at the last. I think it was fatigue on Jackson's part. He lost sight of what he'd done in the first two that made them so magical.Still, a trilogy must have an ending, even if it is somewhat flawed. I will wait with faint hope for the director's cut.

Maybe there are one or two weak numbers here, but I've always felt there were several indispensable classics on this album. &quot;Tatoo&quot; especially. Perhaps some folks don't like the glitzy pop/rock production given to many of the tunes. Personally, I like well-produced, multilayered pop music like Al Stewart's hit records, and this Lightfoot record, along with Gord's East of Midnight album that followed it, certainly fit in that mold. Hopefully the style of the music will not prejudice people and deter them from experiencing the poetry, melody and skillful delivery that Gordon creates and serves up on Salute. They say Gordon has had drinking problems. Endless Wire sounded to me like he was on the sauce and his pitch seemed always just a little off on that record. (Is it just me?) None of that here. Gordon sounds alert, engaged, and in top singing form.I especially love the sound of this record too. The albums recorded at Eastern Sound in Toronto seem to have an inherent clarity to them. (Bruce Cockburn made a couple of excellent sounding records there as well: Further Adventures Of and Joy Will Find a Way.) The old Salute LP record was mastered by Doug Sax at the Mastering Lab which brought out the maximum detail and liquidity that analog is capable of. I have a good vinyl LP copy, so I haven't exactly been pining away for a CD release, but it is very nice to have this available in a remastered edition. I trust Rhino -- I've never heard a bad Rhino remastering.It sounds to me as if a great deal of care was taken in the writing, recording, and producing of this album. What can I say? I put this forward as an example of high quality music-making.

I listened to the entire album over on Lala. While there were no bad tracks, I didn't find anything (except Mer du Japon) that excited me as much as Premiers Symptomes. Granted, Air has moved on to a different style. Apparently it is a style that I don't like as much. For one, if they're going to have lyrics, they need to find a better lyricist. Second, the synthesized vocals sound like an emasculated (i.e. castrated) man. I have nothing against castrati personally, but the sound does not appeal to me in pop music. Finally, the compositions themselves, while many are pleasant dreamy tracks that may inspire daydreams and induce calm, did not hold my attention. Perhaps there is some musical subtlety that I'm missing, but I don't think so.It all depends on what you're looking for. I think I will buy Talkie Walkie, which isn't perfect, but has a greater number of quality tracks that draw me back to them again and again. As for this new CD, I believe I will pass. However, if your tastes trend toward ambient music, this may have more appeal for you.

Putting lyrics to Monk's songs is a bit like putting lyrics to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. It can be done, but probably it will never be a perfect fit. Sally Swisher, Abbey Lincoln, Mike Ferro, Bernie Hanighen, and Jon Hendricks put words to Monk's be-bop tunes that appear on this album. The main benefit is that the words provide Carmen McRae something to wrap her vocal chords around. And that's enough. All of McRae's strengths as a vocalist are in evidence here -- spontaneity, dynamic and tonal range, phrasing, joy, intellect. She takes control of these songs, and they are in good hands.Among the other virtues of this album:1. McRae doesn't hog the stage. Everybody gets chances to solo, and the solos are very easy to take. McRae gets her licks in too, with a bit of scatting, in moderation.2. Generally the song lengths are kept moderately short. They don't wear out the theme or generate listener fatigue. The solos don't wander off into neverland. Each player presents a tasty little piece, and then the next guy gets a turn.3. Two live cuts here are fantastic, with old Monk alumnus Charlie Rouse on sax. The studio cuts are no less spontaneous and inspired.Any moderately knowledgeable jazz fan will know these songs, because they've been covered endlessly. But McRae and her band present these songs in a most accessible way, light, with humor, dynamics, variety -- very easy to take and a treat for all but the most snobbish.I only have a few other recordings of Carmen McRae, but this one tops anything I've heard. What a crowning achievement for her career!For the cheapskates, I should note that the original release of this album, now out of print, is available as of this writing, for around $2.Carmen Sings MonkDon't deprive yourself of this joyful celebration of Monk's best.

Bruce Cockburn is a wonderful guitarist. He plays electric guitar, but he shines on the six string acoustic. I never much cared for his improvised electric guitar solos, but I don't recall any of those on this disc.Bruce recorded a jazzy electric instrumental, Radio Days, for the Inner City Front album, but this does not appear on Speechless -- probably for the best. Also missing is a sentimental favorite of mine, Deer Dancing Around A Broken Mirror from his live Circles In The Stream record. Strangely, the short but sweet instrumentals from his Christmas CD are also missing.Bruce recorded three new tunes for this album. I've heard them, and if you have Bruce's back catalog, these new songs are not sufficient to justify the CD purchase.If you are new to Cockburn, I would still recommend going back to the beginning, and picking up his 1970s and 1980s albums, starting with Dancing In The Dragon's Jaws, which has no instrumental pieces, but does have some ravishingly beautiful acoustic guitar playing nevertheless. Then you'll have most if not all of the older songs that appear on this CD.I love Bruce Cockburn, but I think his guitar playing is best appreciated in the context it originally appeared -- as a backing instrument for his vocals, and occasionally as a solo voice on instrumental pieces. Bruce's instrumentals are better in small doses, sandwiched in between his other fine songs.Still, this is fine work, and if you only want "speechless" Cockburn, this album is just the ticket for you.

There are seven parts in the DVD HBO miniseries. We watched them in seven nights. We didn't want to skip a night.It's all good, but the earlier episodes are better than the later ones. Why? I felt too much was skipped during the last few parts. Too many gaps. Naturally some events would have to be left out or the series would be 40 hours. Yet, it would have been better for them to narrow the focus on his earlier career.In the final three parts it was hard to get a feel for the scope of what was going on in the country -- it became more of a personal story. And even in that context, it was hard to get a sense of all the big national events that were affecting John and Abigail personally, outside of family affairs. During John's presidency, I don't recall seeing any Congressional sessions, speeches, or proper cabinet meetings. If there were, they are minor.Did the series capture John's and Abigail's character? As much as I know from my limited reading, yes, probably fairly well. I was surprised by the magisterial manner of Jefferson as portrayed here. His overwhelming sense of calm and thoughtful genius was appealing. I haven't read in detail enough about Jefferson to say if that was accurate. He had a great passion for art, collecting books, and of course architecture. But that passion does not seem to be evident in this portrayal. He's almost disturbingly Mr. Spock-like in emotional restraint.The intrigues and battles between Jefferson as Vice-President when Adams succeeded Washington as President are given relatively small notice, as is the Sedition Act. Adams did start a navy and avoided entaglement with a European war. Most of the events of his single term are seen from the dreary setting of a still-under-construction White House in Washington, D.C.Picky points:Many famous quotes of the founding fathers are included in this series, not always in the context of which they actually uttered them.The artificial aging makeup or lack of it, and the inconsistency of it, was a bit disconcerting. Sometimes John looked older in one scene, then younger in the next. This was handled poorly, and I don't know why, given today's state of the art. Neither John nor Abigail appear to age naturally. The bad dental work, pus, vomit, bloodlettings and barbaric surgery of the 18th century are represented with some realism, though, for what that's worth, plus the excessive facial makeup the French nobles (including men) used. Marcel Marceau would have fit right in.In spite of these caveats, the miniseries is compelling. It's no substitute for David McCullough's book, though. Additionally, I'm not sure about replay value. I was enthusiastic about it while I was watching it, but now I wonder if I will want to see it twice.

If you're the sort of person who likes puzzles in a movie strictly for their own sakes, then you may find worth in The Lost Room. The production values are good -- video is a little soft on focus, but otherwise it is pretty to look at. The dialog and acting are reasonably good.This series reminds me a bit of last year's Journeyman series on NBC. It sets the main character in a sort of ridiculous situation -- jumping through time, but not randomly. Seemingly there was a purpose behind it. A purpose seemed evident, and some sort of mechanism was hinted at but never resolved. In the end, you have a fantastical premise, with characters doing their best to resolve problems within the strange situation they faced.In the Lost Room, characters are not jumping through time, but into some other dimension and back to normality. Many devices exist that have fantastical qualities, used for good or ill by various factions. Two of the characters want to retrieve their lost children. One group has quasi-religious motives in obtaining these devices. Another faction wants to sequester the devices because they feel earth is in danger from this other dimension.In the end, the personal drama of the main character is resolved. The ultimate questions about why these devices exist, who made them, and whether they represent an existential danger or a potential blessing to humanity are not resolved. If you can live with that ambiguity, you may enjoy the personal drama. For myself, I can't say that was enough to justify the four plus hours spent watching the series. I was hooked enough to want to see the end, but having seen it, I feel let down.Mr. T would just say, "Ain't got time for no jibber-jabber!"Shakespeare would say, " ...like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."The Lost Room is not idiotic. But it surely does signify nothing.

I don't think the original studio recording from the Tapestry album can be beat, actually. This live performance is fine, though the sound quality is not as good as I had hoped. You might check out a different live recording of this tune from Carole King's The Living Room album. For me, that performance and the recording quality are superior to this track.

The performance: Frank sounds in great voice. I like the smaller band as accompaniment.The sound: If you're listening in stereo, especially on headphones, the sound is distinctly strange, distant, indistinct, phase-y. It's a little like listening to the concert from out in the hallway of the venue. Frank's voice comes from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. This appears to be a monophonic recording that is reprocessed electronically to give a simulation of stereo. But it's a very poor simulation. Awful, to be honest. The credits state that this album was digitally edited and mastered by Lee Herschberg. I have heard Herschberg's work before, and normally respect and appreciate the sound quality he gets. Perhaps he did the best he could with a substandard master tape.With a little effort and the right software (I used Exact Audio Copy and dBpowerAMP Music Converter v10.0), this album can be made more listenable. I ripped the stereo tracks to my hard drive and then simply converted them to mono -- with a program that sums the two channels into one (i.e. I used dBpowerAMP to convert the stereo WAV file into a monophonic WAV file with the same sample frequency).With this treatment, Frank's voice snaps into focus, with weight and body. The sextet is just a little lower in mix than I would have cared for -- Frank sounds right up front. But that's not really a bad thing. Bass and highs are a little subdued, but the mid frequencies are clean and smooth. The mid frequencies are where most of the music resides. The dynamics are a little compressed, but tolerably so -- in stereo or mono.If you're into vinyl and willing to pay a premium price, you may want to investigate the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab double LP release of Sinatra and Sextet. I haven't heard it, but it likely sounds much better than the CD. Investigate reviews. It's worth considering, at least.Or you can try my experiment -- converting stereo CD files to mono and listen to them as WAV files or with a little more effort you can burn a mono CD. I think you will be pleased. You can't turn the Sinatra and Sextet CD into a high fidelity demonstration disc. But you can make it sound like a normal, decent monophonic live recording.

I must agree with the first reviewer who describes these dances as delightful. That's the best word for it. If this music doesn't put a smile on your face, you must be a world-class sourpuss.I have the twin-LP London box set, so I've enjoyed these for years. So what if it isn't "serious" music? It is great music for enjoyment. Dorati performs this with just the right flair. Just because the music is melodic and easy to take doesn't mean it is trite or poor quality.Ladies and gentlemen, shake the powder from your wigs, find a partner, and dance! Or just close your eyes, sit back in your chair, and sway with the music. Haydn must have had a merry soul.

I haven't seen the movie. Very little on the soundtrack album made me want to.The most successful performances here are the *least* technically proficient ones. The simple sentimentality of Ashley Judd singing True Love was winning. Kevin Kline half-whispering In the Still Of The Night with support from Judd almost brought tears to my eyes. That alone raised my curiosity about the film, with its tender emotion. No doubt that marriage was a strange relationship, but Kline really sells this song of genuine affection and attachment to his wife.As for the rest, at least Diana Krall does not murder Just One of Those Things -- it is very listenable. But this kind of music is no stranger to Krall. Vivian Green brings a convincing sadness and weariness to Love For Sale. She has a beautiful voice, by the way.Blow, Gabriel, Blow, very near the end of the CD, picked up the pace and saved me from lapsing into a coma from the rest of the songs, which are whitebread performances by pop singers who don't belong in this genre and who are usually happy to stick to the notes as written. They can't seem to make the music breathe, to build to climaxes and then recede, to throw in the unexpected, or to take on a persona that fits the song.Fred Astaire and Bobby Short have the attitude and the phrasing to sell Cole Porter songs. This gaggle of pop celebrities, from Elvis Costello to Alanis Morissette, do not.I suppose the pop stars were enticed to do this film for commercial reasons. The implication is that Robbie Williams fans, and Sheryl Crow fans, and Mick Hucknal fans would all buy tickets to the movie and increase the box office. I can't comment on this from a business standpoint, but artistically it was a flat-out failure. Elvis Costello has about as much business singing Let's Misbehave as he does singing lieder by Shubert or Grieg. He ain't got the pipes. What's next? Tom Waits singing Gershwin?With several effective sleeping pills already on the market, I think this album serves little purpose.Good night.

Solo guitar. Simple and honest. Expertly played. So what's not to like? I didn't dislike this album. Not at all. It's very easy listening. I'm a guitar player, and it is interesting to hear another player's bag of tricks.But... I think it's the songs. Bonfa wrote the vast majority of the tunes on this record, and for some reason they just didn't grab me. They didn't speak to me in any deep way.The conclusion I've come to about Luiz Bonfa is that he's written a handful of tunes that are stunningly beautiful, catchy, absolute classics. If the only thing he ever wrote was Manha de Carnaval, he earned his place in jazz history. I love Samba de Orfeo (not appearing on this album), The Gentle Rain, and Non-Stop to Brazil. The latter two were not, to my knowledge, even written at the time of this recording.So the majority of the songs here are pleasant songs with easy melodies and gentle rhythms. Perhaps they would really shine in a jazz combo environment, with ample improvisation. That I can't say. For me, most of these never do rise above pleasant and competent. In the case of the guitar playing, very very competent, but music is more than technique.Perhaps you'll be much more enthused. If you love traditional Brazilian guitar music, try to audition this, and give it your consideration.

Long Distance is like an LP with two sides. The first six tracks run the gamut from moody to dreamy to bouncy. There's no plan or program -- just fine individual pop tunes with Ivy's trademark class production and Dominique Durand's breathy sly understated vocals. Tracks 7-12 constitute a complete work by themselves, like the flip side of Abbey Road. A bit downtempo and dreamy (I used that word already, but it fits for these songs), but mesmerizing. A desert island disc.Five stars are given too lightly by most reviewers on amazon.com. But I really mean it. This is pop music in a class with Sergeant Pepper, XTC's Oranges and Lemons, James Taylor's Gorilla, or Paul Simon's Still Crazy After All These Years. Top of the heap.Not to mention Edge of the Ocean, the best and most beautiful pop song of the past decade, cut number 3. Ivy has the capacity to take simplicity and make it compelling listening. Hear for yourself the magic of Ivy.

Joanna Newsom, if she practiced, could probably play the harp well enough to keep folk reasonably entertained during their Sunday buffet brunch at the local Holiday Inn -- playing folk tunes like Greensleaves and soft pop standards. If she tried to sing during the gig, she'd probably evoke titters of laughter or people would start stuffing their napkins in their ears. She sounds like an elf with mild laryngitis. Her poetry is like a 16 year old's attempt at "serious, deep" lyrics. Her songs last like... forever.Obviously, she's a serious artist. Like Tiny Tim. The thing is, Mr. Tim was in on the joke. Or maybe not. But Newsom appears to have scammed herself into believing she has something to contribute. The only question is how many other people will be hypnotized by the arpeggiated harping into thinking they've been entertained.I would give this one star, but that lowest rating must be reserved for truly evil uses of the musical arts, like Kenny G albums and Celine Dion.If you like something a little off-kilter, might I suggest Andrew Bird's Mysterious Production of Eggs? Or middle-period XTC albums? Stan Ridgway's Partyball? There's good weird, and then there's just weird. It's clear which category I think Ys belongs in.

I was particularly impressed with the clarity of the recording on this issue. The piano and bass are clean and clear. I suppose the drums are no less clear, but I found them to be rather too low in the mix. Unless you goose the volume, the drums are merely a quiet rustle in the background. This is a fault, or at least I thought it was a flaw, either in the microphone placement, mixing, or mastering stage.Frankly, I like shorter jazz tracks, because too often when musicians stretch out too much, it becomes tedious. Perhaps that identifies me as only a dabbler in jazz. Well no, but I am very critical of endless, mindless blowing of frenetic cascades of notes that ultimately do not move my soul. I prefer the more restrained approach of an Ahmad Jamal Trio, for example.No chance of that happening here. As another reviewer notes, generally there is an intro (some of the intros are very classy and beautiful), the theme, a few variations, and theme again. This is music to be savored and enjoyed, not analyzed, not something you'll have to strain your musical sensibilities to grasp. Oscar keeps his speed-demon tendencies in check. The lyrical and swinging characteristics of Frank's signature songs are emphasized on this outing.In conclusion, this is a fine album. Not quite the caliber of Night Train, but very solid. Wouldn't it have been great if Oscar had made an album like this with the Chairman of the Board himself?

Cherry Marmalade Kay's first solo album, and hopefully first of many. Compared to her work in Letters to Cleo and the soundtrack to Josie and the Pussycats, this collection of songs by Kay and guitarist Mike Eisenstein is a bit less angry, less frenzied, with more pop flavor, even a little country music influence sprinkled in. Most of the tunes work very well, with strong, interesting melodies, and sympathetic backing from her bandmates. Hanley sets and meets a high standard here for material, performance, and production. Best of all, it is simply fun to listen to.Though touching on different genres. this record is as good as the best of Letters to Cleo, and anyone who enjoys well-crafted pop/rock music should find enjoyment here. Kay Hanley's voice sincerely communicates zest for life, longing, loss, all these things -- without a false note. I believe that skill is really the key to the artistic success of the projects she's done. There is an essential honesty in her work. The only way this album could have been improved is if the songs were more harmoniously related to one another in theme and style. Get it, listen, admire, and enjoy.

As a fan of past Batman animated releases -- especially Mask of the Phantasm and Mr. Freeze: Sub-Zero, I had to see this.Some of the visuals are very sumptuous, but some the character designs for Batman are quite ugly.Mainly this video falls down on the concept: trying to tell six short short stories in about 65 minutes. There isn't any room for character development, hardly any room for plot development.Unless you groove on watching the visuals over and over, the best advice I can offer is to rent it. Once. It's worth about a buck or two to see, but that's it. If I bought it, it would only gather dust on the shelf.

There are four great albums in Stewart's career so far, and this is one of them. Some have called this overproduced. Perhaps it is, compared to Between the Wars (another of the four great Stewart albums), but that one is UNDERproduced.I felt that the thickly-layered instrumentation and production added to the grandeur of these literate and melodic materpieces. My only criticism is that they tried to do an Alan Parsons-type production on the cheap, using keyboard synthesizers and string machines, whereas Parsons would have used more acoustic instruments and a real orchestra. No doubt this had partly to do with budgetary constraints.Whatever its debatable flaws might be, I can't think of any album released in the past two or three years that comes close to this kind of artistic quality, though Norah Jones' debut was adorable, and surprisingly a hit as well. (How did THAT happen?)If you like melody, if you like literate music that tackles subjects beyond moon-spoon-June love songs or their more vulgar modern counterparts, and if you like intelligently and intricately arranged pop music, then this ought to appeal. Yes, Al Stewart can entertain with just a microphone and a guitar slung over his shoulder. He can play the stripped-down folkie. But he also shines in this environment, as the central voice in orchestral pop -- and the material here is equal to Year of the Cat.All I'm trying to say is, &quot;This is just GOOD!&quot;

I'm not wildly enthusiastic about this -- at 2 hours it seems to be a bit long. I'm not as critical as others are about the performance. Yes, Brett looks puffy and not quite well. Still, the performances are very good.I just feel that people should know that this DVD offers image quality barely superior to VHS videotape. I know that better results are obtainable. The last Granada series of shorter Sherlock Holmes programs has excellent image quality. This is fuzzy, lacks contrast, it's just plain substandard.Sooner or later they will remaster these with improved quality, and then you'll be stuck with the old, crummy first edition. But given the importance of the Brett Holmes series, they should have taken the trouble to get it right the first time.

I bought this when it was first released -- on the recommendation of Stereo Review, as I recall. The woodwinds don't naturally mesh that well with the traditional jazz bass, piano, and drums. But Ron Carter is hardly a conventional soloist, and he's playing an unconventional instrument himself.I can't say that this is the pinnacle of jazz, but I always found it listenable, and I have a warm spot in my heart for it. It is generally melodic. The title track makes me smile. Most of the tracks give me a very positive vibe. Not actually comedic, as one reviewer suggested, but happy. The soloing? It may not be transcendent, but it's interesting enough.Perhaps you just have to let it grow on you. I didn't own that many albums when I first bought this, so I probably gave it more spins on the turntable than if I had bought it today. You'll have to weigh how much you like Ron Carter against the chance that you may not like this little experiment. Honestly, I didn't find it that unconventional. The bass sound is very forward, very confrontational, if you will. It isn't always exceptionally pretty. But for me it was a fun little album.

There's nothing more to be said about the production itself -- high class all the way, and Brett is Holmes, closer than any other actor has been able to touch. (Nicol Williamson did a very credible job in The Seven Per-Cent Solution. It could have been great if Grenada had hired him to finish the S.H. series after Brett's untimely death. I don't know if this was ever considered, but I think about the possibility wistfully.)As a public service, particularly in view of the increasing popularity of high definition television sets and home theater, people need to be aware of the half-baked job of DVD mastering this series got. Most of the time, it is better than VHS, but that's not saying much.The most charitable thing I can say is that the picture quality is acceptable, most of the time. But it is still grainy in a way that reflects poor conversion to DVD, not the grain of the original film itself. The last three episodes are crammed onto one single layer disc, with degradation that would be evident to anyone with a 13" TV set. Even the color suffers -- especially on The Resident Patient, everything has a horrible greenish tan cast. The focus is fuzzy, not sharp. The sound is intermittently warbly and muffled in spots too. I have seen VHS versions of some of these episodes, and they would be preferrable to the worst of this lot.To add insult to injury, The Return of Sherlock Holmes set is even worse in some ways than this set! "Inconceivable!" as Wallace Shawn would say in The Princess Bride.I suspect that the region 2 DVDs of this series available in England are much better, but I have not seen them. You'd need an all region DVD player to play them in USA.Most people will watch these and be happy in spite of the substandard video, simply because the stories and acting are great. But what is the point of having these programs on DVD if they are not DVD quality? If a VHS set of Adventures of S.H. can be obtained for reasonable money, I that is a sensible option until this series is remastered properly.

Not a review as such, though I am familiar with the majority of the albums in this box set. Amazon has not seen fit to list the albums in this set. Stupid. Now that it's out of print, maybe it is pointless to list them now, but I know some are curious, so here goes:1. Freewheelin' Bob Dylan2. Another Side of Bob Dylan3. Bringing it All Back Home4. Highway 61 Revisited5. Blonde on Blonde (i)6. Blonde on Blonde (ii)7. John Wesley Harding8. Nashville Skyline9. Planet Waves10. Blood on the Tracks11. Desire12. Street Legal13. Slow Train Coming14. Infidels15. Oh Mercy16. Love and TheftThese are hybrid discs, with two layers of data (like a DVD). One layer can be read by an ordinary CD player. The other layer contains high resolution sound (24 bit digital instead of 16 bits which is standard CD resolution) that can only be played with a Super Audio CD player (SACD) or a CD or DVD player with SACD capability.

I compared the new remaster to the earlier Geffen CD release, which revealed some interesting differences.The peak levels on both versions are the same. The new remaster (Caroline Records CAR50690) sounds louder, so average levels are bumped up. This means a compression of dynamic range between soft and loud, i.e. the loudest sounds stay the same, but the softer sounds are increased in volume. I generally prefer less compression, but this album was somewhat compressed to begin with.The remaster is more forward -- the vocals and guitars and keyboards stand out more. The sound is generally cleaner and the timbre is more natural in the midrange and high frequencies. Vocals, cymbals, guitar strums, and tinkly things sound more real.On the other hand, the bass and drums have more impact on the original Geffen release, while the midrange and high frequencies are less prominent, and the detail is a little smeared. This is a disappointment, because I love Colin Moulding's bass work, and I don't think the remastered version does it justice.Colin Moulding also wrote five songs on Skylarking, better than the two or three he'd get to do on some other XTC records. I think it lends more balance to the album, with less domination of Andy Partridge's sometimes strident vocals and Partridge's generally weirder -- but still fun -- songs.Skylarking is a great pop album. I love what Todd Rundgren did with these songs, except that he tends to mix things to sound good on the radio, and that means his recordings may sound a little bland on better equipment. Oranges and Lemons, XTC's follow-up to Skylarking, is quirkier and more to my liking, but the songs and arrangements on Skylarking are top-drawer XTC. I'd have to say they peaked with these two mid-career albums.Despite my reservations about dynamic range compression and the diminishing of the bass frequencies, this is a pleasant-sounding remaster. Does the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs remaster have the best of both worlds? I don't know. I haven't heard it. I'm tempted to track down a copy, though. This is music that deserves the best audio presentation.A final point about the liner notes. All the lyrics are there, on the center two pages of the booklet. But print is so ridiculously small that you may need a magnifier to read them, even if you're not an 80-year old grandma. I'm nearsighted, and if I take off my glasses and plant the booklet about 8 inches from my eyes, I can barely make the words out. Normal CD-booklet text is small enough, but this is absurd. And inexcusable. Whomever is responsible for the graphic design of the booklet needs his or her head examined. What were they thinking?! It is a sign they just didn't care, but I for one believe lyrics are an important part of the album, and when you pay extra money to get the physical product, it should be properly designed with some useful amenities -- like lyrics, of course. The CD booklet of the original Geffen has the lyrics, and the print is moderately small, but not microscopic.

I'm giving this 3 stars.Only six episodes in the first season, so it is definitely no bargain to purchase.The production values do not meet the standard of Alias or other American spy shows.As for the plots, they are very good. MI-5 is a more realistic series than Alias, but it seems constrained by comparison. In Alias, the characters are always jetting off to some exotic locale, James Bond-style. The spooks in MI-5 are often limited to the drudgery of computer searches, stakeouts, and trying to blend in to the scenery as they tail suspects or liase with fellow spies or CIA agents. And they stay in jolly old England.I have a problem with the season one villains. They seem a little trite, a little too one-dimensional. This improved greatly in season two.The team of MI-5 characters and the actors who play them are very likeable. We get to know the personal side, the motivations, and some of the strengths and weaknesses of Tom Quinn, Zoe, and Danny -- the spooks who form the core of the MI-5 series. This team is a great foundation for a recurring series of adventures, and the actors grow in confidence and believability in season two.Season one is an above-average television spy show. I don't think the series really comes into its own until season two, where the personal dramas of the MI-5 team and the enemies they are fighting become more gripping. I think visually - in terms of cinematography - season two is an improvement as well. Everything seems to be kicked up a notch in quality after season one.The major weakness of season one was the trite and obvious villians they chose as their targets.

The set list for this intimate (but not unplugged) concert consists largely of songs from Neil's solo album Try Whistling This plus some favorites from the Split Enz days.It's all great. Some of the songs from Try Whistling This are a little strange, but they come off better in this live performance than on the studio recording, which often sounds murky. In my experience this is unusual -- the live take being clearly superior to the labored-over studio take -- but Finn and company pull it off due to Neil's professionalism and inspiration. Neil was in great voice, the band (including a young Liam Finn) more than competent. They can rock out, but they can also play the pretty tunes with sensitivity.This concert is worthy of repeat viewings, and in my collection it overshadows the compact disc, especially in light of the sterling uncompressed sound of the LPCM stereo soundtrack.The price is right. Sound is good. Performance is great. What's not to like? Five stars were earned in this instance. It was one of Sessions @ West 54th's finest hours.

Jason Falkner is a fantastic musician. His first two albums, Author Unknown and Can You Still Feel should convince anyone with ears of that judgment.This is something other. I suppose it succeeds in being good music to lullabye a child to sleep with, but it is certainly not what I would choose for relaxation. Others obviously disagree, but I felt Falkner stripped the feeling out of these until they became Muzak. This album does nothing for me, except perhaps make me long for the original recording, or an interpretation that is not designed to put me to sleep.A mix tape of Enya's slower songs would work as well and be much more engaging.I'm kind of glad this CD is still selling for Jason, but I'll pass. He's great at power pop, but we don't need any more snooze-fests.

I'm sure Lark Rise To Candleford Season One is not perfect, though I see the word "perfection" being used again and again in other amazon reviews. It is the best period series of this type that I've ever seen. It's beautiful to look at, well-written, top-notch acting, engaging dramas and situations mostly appropriate to the time and place.Frankly, I can't find anything to criticize about it. It's a delight. Perhaps it IS perfection, after all!

I own the Japanese pressing of this album (MVCJ-14022), but I have no reason to believe the master used is any different from an American pressing.The musical selection is good on this Priceless Jazz release. It contains a variety of songs not found on Jamal's other compilation albums, Ahmad's Blues and Cross Country Tour. (Both are excellent collections of Ahmad's classic jazz trio period.) I consider New Rhumba, On Green Dolphin Street, Night Mist Blues, Misty, Whisper Not, essential Ahmad Jamal recordings, and you can get them in one package on Priceless Jazz. Ahmad's clear, clean, spacious jazz stylings are his hallmrk, and those qualities are present on Priceless Jazz in abundance.Now for the bad news. On Green Dolphin Street has never sounded that good on any MP3 or album cut I've heard. I guess the best source tape is in poor shape. Is it "fake stereo?" It might be. It sounds just a little wobbly in spots.Track 3, Poinciana, sounds like it came from a tape a generation or two removed from the cleaner reproduction on the Cross Country Tour album. Same recording, same location, but on Priceless Jazz, this song sounds distant and a bit softer than it should.The Best Thing For You, Night Mist Blues, and Whisper Not, are "needle drops." That is, The producers of this compilation played a vinyl record or acetate and put the result on this CD. Unfortunately, they did not have the courtesy to take out the pops and clicks on the record. This is most evident on Whisper Not, but small ticks will be heard periodically throughout the other two songs.A vinyl record might be the best source the producers had available when they were compiling tracks for Priceless Jazz. So I don't necessarily fault them for that. But even in 1998 when this CD was released, decent audio editing tools existed so they could have removed the noise. I can do so today on my own computer, if I want to record a vinyl album to CD and take out the pops and clicks. That the producer did not do so on this record is a sign of extreme laziness and a bit of disdain or indifference to the consumer.In conclusion, the music is great. The recording quality varies a lot from cut to cut. Misty sounds very clean and clear. Others, not so much. And then there is the issue of clicks and pops on tracks 4,5, and 10. If this problem was fixed on the American release, I hope someone will correct me. The tracks are still very listenable, just as an old vinyl album can be very listenable. However, in the CD era, when the technology exists to easily remove these noise artifacts, there isn't really any good excuse for not doing so.

If you are familiar with Ivy from their great Long Distance and Apartment Life CDs, you won't want to be without this, their first EP. Every song here is a gem of sweet music with a sarcastic, ironic lyrical twist that keeps it from getting saccharine. This rocks a bit more than Long Distance. The recording is very good. It is a skillful, assured half-album at a nice half-album price. The perfect debut of a wonderful band, a harbinger of much pleasurable music that was (and we hope still is) to come. These are some of my favorite Ivy tunes.$6.98? What are you waiting for?

This was the first EP from Ivy. This band has showed amazing pop craftsmanship from the beginning. Each song here is a gem. Ivy puts out quality albums with little or no filler material. (Granted I haven't heard their latest album of covers, &quot;Guest Room,&quot; so I'll reserve judgment on that.) I downloaded all of their material from Lately, and from the albums that followed (Realistic, Apartment Life, and Long Distance). All had great songwriting, arranging, and spirit. I had to buy them all. If you like melodic, well-produced pop, you can't go wrong with this or any other Ivy album. Long may they wave, if they can keep their standards this high.

The first three seasons of The Unit were among the best TV shows of the modern era. The writing made the incredible believable. Or at least it was so good, we suspended our disbelief. OK, toward the end of the third season, the subplots were getting a little too close to soap opera, but I did not mind.Season Four has a story arc that runs through the year. Unfortunately, the twists and turns are just a little too wild, especially the notion of bringing the wives in as "agents" as it were. No, the show didn't jump the shark. But it became ordinary. Saying so is like an insult, considering how powerful was the story-telling that came before the last season.If you haven't seen the show, see seasons 1-3. I bought them and was glad I did. In a while I will enjoy seeing them again. Naturally I wanted to see season four, but I had already been warned that the quality had dropped off. I did not buy it and I do not recommend a purchase. Rent it, get it from the library. If you can't find a way to see it, don't worry that you're missing something wonderful. It is watchable, but not essential. I was sad to see this one go downhill.

Some people will not be convinced that small ceramic magnets can be used for healing, but my experience of over 15 years using such magnets is proof that they can. I have recently been corresponding with a woman in Japan who has severe cartilage inflammation, and cannot use adequate doses of steroid anti-inflammatories because they are immunosuppressive. She has had very good results using small magnets. Her ear cartilage will cease swelling and the redness will start to decline within 10 minutes of application of the magnets.This would be dismissed as "anecdote" by scoffers. But it is repeatable and reliable.Believe what you will. Wait until a major scientific study is done, if you must. But magnets are not expensive, and they're safe. Perhaps, with Gary Null's guidance, you will benefit by performing your own experiments. I do not sell magnets, and have no axe to grind. I simply report that they work, for me, and for others.

Bella is the best movie I've seen all year. Oddly, the origin of the movie was the intention of the writers/producers to make a film that presents a positive role model of strong Latino families (in this case, a family of Puerto Rican/Mexican origin). It also has a strong pro-life message. But often when filmmakers set out to send a message, the art gets compromised on the way to beating you over the head with it. The Ultimate Gift for example, while it didn't completely beat you over the head, did seem more contrived, and the lead's acting wasn't always tops.Every good movie is of necessity a contrivance. The trick is to make it seem utterly natural, living and breathing. That's a function of the script and acting. There's a very short scene in Bella with two brothers -- in the beginning, there isn't even any dialogue. They just sit at the counter eating, and one elbows the other, the other elbows the first brother back, back and forth, back and forth. It tells more than words ever could. Simple, natural, and it rings perfectly true. The whole movie has that sort of effortless genuine feeling. The family message and the pro-life message is preached in the softest way, like those pro-life TV commercials the Mormons ran a few years ago.The majority of Bella takes place in the space of a day and a half. A restaurant on the streets of New York is preparing for a big meal, the boss ordering all the staff around. We see a young woman at the drugstore, then at home, taking a pregnancy test -- Nina is a waitress at the restaurant, and when she finally gets to work, the boss complains that this is her third time late, and she's fired. The chef at the restaurant (the boss's brother), witnesses this. Nina runs off, but she's dropped something, and the chef picks it up and runs after her. He spends the day with Nina, and being a friend to her in time of need will change both of their lives...A great deal of the artfulness of this movie is how much is left out of the story of the two main characters. The chef had a major disaster in his life a few years before, an accident that derailed his life plans and it still haunts him. We see the incident in some relatively brief flashbacks. And Nina tells a bit of her life story, but without a lot of detail. The ending is also very subtle and not completely fleshed out. It only shows what you need to see for the emotional resolution of the story.Bella won the Toronto International Film Festival's People's Choice Award in 2006, an honor given to films like Chariots of Fire, Strictly Ballroom, Hotel Rwanda, The Princess Bride, and The Big Chill. It deserves to be in that league.If this isn't enough to recommend it, it is also a family movie, without sleaze and language, featuring characters who model the values of family, respect, kindness, and helping others.

This album doesn't knock me out like his major label debut (Presents Author Unknown), but it is a solid effort in the vein of the follow-up Can You Still Feel. You'll hear echoes of Kinks, Beatles, McCartney, the softer side of XTC, and other greats of melodic pop. Jason has absorbed a great many influences, and he whips them all together into rich musical stew. When you hear his composing skill on display in these new tunes, it really does break your heart that Jason can't get the budget and promotion he deserves. Actually, Jason seems to do pretty well producing his own stuff, but in sheer audio quality terms, it is not the best.McCartney is a good reference point. This album is better than anything McCartney has put out in years. Chaos and Creation was a good album, and Jason was one of the studio musicians working with McCartney on it. But Jason's album has more energy and authenticity in my book.If you've heard Falkner's work before, you know what to expect. No surprises here, good or bad. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I cannot understand why in a world of "American Idols" Jason Falkner can't be taken more seriously. His work is just as radio-friendly, he's as good a performer, and it has much more depth than the singers being churned out of the "Idol factory." Just another example of perversity in the music biz, I guess.

If you're considering a purchase of Season Three, I can assume you've seen the first two seasons. There isn't any big departure from the formula, which is a good thing. There was a little too much emphasis on mindless action for my taste this time around.The first season episodes have better writing. I've watched those several times and they still hold up. I won't be replaying the third season as often.I really don't think there is much character development. Dana is still given virtually nothing to do. The writers were cruel to her. Max is a great cast member, as always. But I don't remember the stories involving much of Terry's mother and brother, or much related to high school. The plots are mostly given over to the Batman side of Terry's double life. The other part of his life is less prominent.Another reviewer mentioned no subtitles. I can't remember if the first two seasons had them. Nevertheless, their absence was annoying. How cheap can they be, not to subtitle the programs for the hearing-impaired? Bad form, Warner Brothers.This is a fitting end to the series (though the final program was a bit lame). It doesn't quite live up to the joy I experienced watching the first two seasons, but Batman Beyond held up a level of quality I haven't found in any other animated program. It was a great team, a great theme, and well executed by the writers, actors, and animators. Buy it, watch it, love it.

I bought every James Taylor album from Sweet Baby James through his live CD and New Moon Shine, with much enjoyment from each one. I must confess that Hourglass never took hold with me. I felt underneath it all, it was a little sad, a little morose, and I never listened to it much past the first couple run-throughs. Then I donated it to the library. In addition, I've begun to sour on James Taylor because of his politics, but he's never been obnoxious about it like Tim Robbins, so it isn't that big a deal. But I think his feelings about the country are affecting the mood of his music.It was with much trepidation that I approached October Road. In fact I did not buy it when it first appeared. I waited to hear a friend's copy.In terms of songwriting, October Road is a great return to form. Sonically it seems a bit closed-in (not a lot of acoustic space apparent), and the production is a bit sparse compared to what we've heard from James in the past.Still, James sounds a little tired to me. The tempos are mostly slow to middlin', and I don't get a lot of joy from this music compared to say, his "JT" album. Mean Old Man is quietly humorous, and Whenever You're Ready is bouncy enough. Whatever. I still get an underlying sense of sadness or weariness listening to this album, and frankly I'd rather go for something more energizing.The songcraft and playing are top notch. Your reaction may be different. You couldn't go wrong picking it up used at half price. You can always sell it again if it doesn't please. I don't know if James will ever make another album I can get enthused about, unless it is a live album. James seems to keep improving as a live performer at the same time his studio albums lose their appeal for me.

I was very disappointed with this movie.It drags on in the same style and tone for nearly two hours.There is too liberal use of the depressing musical score.The movie covers just a slim wedge of a very large story. It lets a few people who were at the prison, who were peripherally involved in the worst incidents, vent their versions of the story. Each of these persons has an axe to grind. Without more context, I cannot tell how credible each one is. Are they trying to excuse their actions? or their inaction? Are they trying to point the finger elsewhere?When I finished the documentary, I still had very little information about who was really responsible for the torture. Private contractors? CIA? Military intelligence? Clearly the people least responsible for these incidents were punished, while those who ordered or performed the most serious abuse and murder of prisoners went free. But I knew that much before I watched the documentary!I believe there are two important topics that should have been covered in the movie. First, there are obvious questions about exactly who was in charge and who gave the orders. Why were such techniques sanctioned? Should those who ordered this extreme treatment be jailed, instead of the low-level military police?Second, I think it must not be denied that the release of the Abu Ghraib photos inflamed the insurgency, and one wonders how many Americans (and Iraqis) died because of that. I'd like to get those who were responsible for making the case public (it was already under military investigation) under the klieg lights and ask them if it was worth making the Iraq conflict worse and leading to more deaths on both sides. Will they accept responsibility for their actions? But when will the media ever learn to take responsibility for the mayhem they cause? That is certainly an element of this tragedy that few have wanted to examine, least of all Errol Morris.

Yes, I burned them in for at least 25 hours. They sounded muddy. Smooth as caramel, but veiled. The bass was heavy and indistinct. The high frequencies were not clean, and not abundant.Having listened to Stax headphones for years and years, I know I got used to a superclean, almost clinical sound. But still I cannot believe how completely different the HD600s were.I borrowed these from a friend, who bought them new and had hardly used them. Frankly, I get more pleasure listening with my Sony MDR-W20G sports headphones that I bought for less than $10. I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews. I would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing. But the one I heard did not. Not even after break-in. Never would I consider one of these phones without auditioning them. Perhaps I truly heard a rare, defective unit. But if so, both drivers were defective, because they sounded the same.

I've lived in Iowa for four decades. Greg Brown also lives and records much of his music here. Writers are advised to "write about what you know." Greg Brown knows Iowa. Honestly, I think I'd rather live in the mountains of Costa Rica. But this place does have its charms, and Greg Brown documents them.This is one of Brown's early albums. Stylistically it is different from his latest work, though virtually all of Brown's albums are in the modern folk tradition. You'll hear echoes of Leon Redbone's old-timey jazz, Bob Dylan's talking blues, and a stereotypical bluegrass sound, like the Alison Krauss band without Krauss.In terms of subject matter, Greg focuses on the serenity, family, community, humor, and cultural continuity of Iowa rural life. Plus there is the ever-present theme of agriculture -- the state motto is "A Place to Grow." In other words, pigs, cows, chickens, corn, beans, and so on.Many of these selections have a simplicity and naturalness that make them sound like classic songs from 100 years ago. The recording quality is only mediocre, and I think the arrangements are a bit on the busy side. Having fewer players might have improved things overall. The soloists are good, but not great -- you won't hear any instrumental virtuosity or profundity.That said, this is one of Brown's classic records. Listen to this, and you can almost smell Grandma's cooking, hear the corn creaking as it grows, and feel the squish of the cowpie you just stepped in. Hey, it ain't all roses! But this music celebrates midwestern ways like a fond Garrison Keiler remembrance.This is probably as good an introduction to Greg Brown's music as any, and I recommend it.

Normally I find overtly Christian movies to be flawed. I'm a Christian, but I am also rather picky about production values, writing, and acting.I checked this DVD out from the library, not knowing what to expect. The acting is uniformly good -- I don't see how any of the actors could have done much better with the material, and there are a few long scenes in the movie which are extremely well-acted.The script could probably have benefited from some tightening here and there. A few small details made me wonder... 'Why would they do this?' or 'Is this realistic?' But those were peripheral issues. The plot is sound, the message is clear. The producers wanted to tug at the viewer's heartstrings, and were pretty effective. As the final credits roll, you will learn that one of the actor's personal experiences line up with the plot of the film so closely, it almost wasn't acting."Bella" is another excellent pro-life message movie. It is more secular in outlook, and more subtle in approach. October Baby is more overtly religious. Both movies are, in a way, about healing from tragic mistakes. I have to give credit to October Baby for having a happy ending that does not seem excessively forced.I don't really care for the style of contemporary music used throughout the film, but that's me. It is a decent representation of modern pop balladry.In the final analysis, I admire the quality of the performances here, with a star taken off for the predictability of the story arc and a few questionable plot elements. It was a very pleasant evening's viewing.
