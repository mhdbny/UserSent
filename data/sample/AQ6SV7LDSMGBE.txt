The added scenes serve only to lengthen an already long movie. A bit more surfing absurdity and a lengthy scene that's as much about rape as comedy (more rape, probably--and a strange--and unfunny--comedy scene)Too many directors are second guessing themselves! Why must they alter their own visions?

It took me 10 minutes to assemble, including the grass catcher. I was outside mowing in 15 and done in an hour.It's a bit heavier than I expected and the grass catcher makes it trickier to maneuver than my old electric, but I like it. It cut through my thick, ugly crabgrass on the lowest setting in no time. I'm looking forward to trying it with the mulcher rather than the grass catcher, just to see the difference. (But my lawn's so short right now, I think it will take a while.)

This is possibly the worst film adaptation ever.If you would like to see a good version, buy the b&amp;w British edition. It's meaningful and dramatic.This version likes the &quot;F&quot; word a lot, confusing, as it never appears in the novel. Also, Simon's dialogue with the Lord of the Flies was a confusing omission.

It's common to update Shakespeare, and this is a nice adaptation. The filmmakers are trying to say that the themes and feelings in R &amp; J are universal and timeless, and the story is updated well to make that work. I especially like the opening scene: Shakespeare often opened with a clown to make the audience pay attention--the director here opens with a punk rock clown-hair colored thug. Nice in-joke.I take a star away because, although I don't mind EDITING Shakespeare, I have some problems that the lines were put in the wrong order. One, in particular (&quot;The drugs are quick&quot;) moved from the death scene at the end to the party scene at the beginning--changing its meaning and altering perception of both scenes.

I've watched this now exactly twice--once upon it's original airing and again last night. I remembered liking it--and I can now see why.Comparing it to the more recent revival of the good Doctor, there are some serious malfunctions here. If you can keep Misters Eccleston, Tennant, and Smith out of it--(or maybe consider them the sequels they apparently ARE) there's a lot to admire here.McGann is an enviable Doctor. Many people disparage the motorcycle chase scene, but I rather admired it. I chuckled while re-watching it thinking "The Doctor has done fairy tales, monster movies, science fiction, and historical fiction--why shouldn't he do 'Smokey and the Bandit?'" Besides, it was fun. I also appreciate that the producers included Sylvester McCoy into the procedings.It is definitely a "period" piece though--reflecting some 90's sensibilities. The gang members look like they came straight out of "21 Jump Street." The Master's gooey CGI looks funny now.It does make me a little sorry that McGann didn't have another try as the Doctor.

This is a Woody Allen movie. From the opening shot to the dialogue, it's a constant surprise how much this resembles other Woody Allen Movies.It doesn't have the charm and good nature of &quot;Bug's Life&quot; and I'm not sure I'd show it to younger children. In fact, there are some scenes later in the movie that are downright gruesome.But there's some wit here, and it's definately worth a look, if not a buy.

...does this series end.Rather than leaving us with any emotional impact over the loss of a long-time character, this movie dispels any tension whatsoever by coming up with a rampant tale of clones and copies, removing any chance that we'll lose a favorite character. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere.

Having this remote makes my driving safer! I clip it to my seatbelt and don't need to reach across the dash every time I want to change a station.Even better--the &quot;scan&quot; feature is a lot of fun. With so many stations I rarely got to hear a lot of what's available on XM. The scan feature is fun. It will scan either my presets, or the whole XM spectrum.Also easier to save songs in my playlist. The large XM button is easier to find than the one on the corner of the Roady.If you've already bought a Roady, spend another couple of bucks and get this, too. You need one.

I'm not a purist, and I realize the music was re-mixed for this. But the restored color and enhanced audio made this a really fun film.This is, however, the weakest of the Beatles films. Suitable to put on as you're cleaning the house and enjoy moments of it, difficult to sit on the couch and watch end-to-end. And remember, the documentary notwithstanding, J, P, G, &amp; R did NOT provide the voices for this film. They are clever forgeries.

Certainly listenable, but I'm not sure it's as good as the original. I'm a big Beatles fan, but I also enjoy Phil Spector, and frankly, I've always thought he got a bad rap about this album. (Apparently, John felt this way, too, as Spector produced a Lennon solo album after this one.)It's pretty in a very different way from the first release, but do you need to own both of them?

The extras on this disk are laughable. By that, I don't mean that you'll laugh at them. The &quot;Reunion&quot; video is 20+ minutes of unscripted bore--the music video is pointless (and there, why, exactly?) The documentary is okay, but you've probably seen it on TV.The movie is, as always, very funny. But I bought it the first time, didn't you? And I fall into line right behind the people who hate the &quot;locked-in&quot; previews. Why should I pay for a disk that forces advertisement down my throat? I hate this trend at the movie theatre, too. Perhaps Universal would like to send me a check every time I watch their ad on my disk.

It's bad enough I have to sit through 20 minutes of trash at the movie theatre, I don't want to have to do it at home, too....the "Class Reunion" extra is unfunny. I'm not even sure there was a script for it. If they weren't really going to try, why did they bother?...I already own "Animal House" on DVD. How often are they going to play this trick on DVD owners? I'm tired of buying a disc only to have it followed up by a disk with more extras a year or so later. Phooey on that. I'm not playing that game anymore. Let them eat re-releases or do it right in the first place!

I decided to try Rolling Stone again after a nearly 10 year absence. This is a rag, only occasionally hinting at its once-greatness. The most recent issue looked like an issue of Maxim (great, I guess if you've got the iq of a 12-year-old boy, not so great for a grown up) I'm really not interested in the latest pop-culture boy-girl-band wannabe, nor am I interested in the sexual escapades of a teenage girl...And if I WAS, I wouldn't want to read about them in THIS magazine, which used to be about art and culture. Why bother? There's no politics, no class and no challenge to this.It used to be the counter-culture's voice...now it's got no culture at all.Good-bye RS!Follow up...What happened? I got a free subscription to RS, so I came back. Insightful political thought has returned to these pages. I'm so glad to see some of the old RS back. I'm glad it's no longer Maxim-ized.

Though often overshadowed by that OTHER band from England, the Rutles were a great influence on the music of the sixties. Unfortunately, this documentary is the only remaining Rutles film in the catalog that is available to consumers.Perhaps interest in this DVD will encourage their record company (Banana Records) to re-release the Rutles entire film and audio catalog so we can determine once and for all who the prime band of the decade was!

There's a movie musical somewhere in David Bowie's talent, but I'm not sure this is it. Don't be deceived by the cover, David's only a minor bit in this.The sets and lights are spectacular here, and the music's pretty good. I like the Sade song. Some of the British accent's a bit hard to catch, (I turned on the captions for the "Ted's not Dead" song)Disappointing extras, and not even a copy of the film's preview. I'm never really partial to slide shows of promotional photos.I think this film just came out at a time when musicals weren't popular. It probably would have fared better if released today. I'm sure some Broadway producer will be ... over it soon, given their proclivity to turn movies and TV shows into Broadway musicals.

I watched this on my portable DVD player while waiting for my car to be repaired at the dealership. It was a pretty boring film, but I continued to watch it as I had nothing better to do. "Blues Clues" was on the waiting room television, and was mildly more interesting than this bad version of Iron Man.By the way. Why does every film about a superhero have to recap the origin of the superhero? Why can't we just say; "He's a millionaire, he wears an iron suit, he blows stuff up." You could probably do that during the opening credits. We don't recap James Bond's origin every time...

Too many things left unsaid and unexplained, I wanted the package wrapped up a little neater.King took shortcuts that used way too much "Deux ex machina" and borrowed way too much material without explaining why. Why Harry Potter weapons, why Dr. Doom Armor? He stole not only from himself (which I, admittedly, found somewhat clever) but from other people with way too much leeway.I did, however, read this book end-to-end without interruption, much the same way I'd devour a bowl of instant pudding. It's a pretty good dessert, but ultimately unsatisfying.

...and you'll get a look at what some brilliant filmmakers correctly thought we'd be watching in the year 2000.A great film, and less violent than I'd remembered. (Or has it been overshadowed by a continued barrage of other violent films?)

A few of the addresses I've tried to find are out of date and it sent me to the middle of a cow pasture when I was looking for a department store. (I discovered that there was a numeral missing from the street address--so it sent me to the middle of the street. I knew I was in trouble when the road turned to dirt.)It also is pretty reliable and will seem to get me where I'm going in strange towns and that's what I bought it for.

Pros:If you buy the 40 gig right now, you get an AV Cable, a dock and some other stuff that don't come with the new 30 gig or 60 gig, so for just a few bucks more than the 30 gig, you get a bunch of extra pricey stuff.Great looking screen, easy interface, easy to download and arrange songs.Cons:Can't figure out how to get/display album art for the CD's I've been ripping to my ipod. I've got a ton of discs I wanted to consolodate and put away. I'm disappointed that the album art is apparently not displayable.Software didn't come with necessary version if iphoto, Apple's website helpfully (?) suggests I buy iLife '05, (which is also rather pricey.) I've managed to buy a copy of iLife '04, which I hope will solve my problem, but why not give me all the software I need to run the device as designed?I'm going to like my iPod, but no one ever likes a "bait and switch."Addendum:OK, so I figured out how to get the album art on my iPod, but why doesn't cddb automatically download it? I have to search for it myself on Google and drag and drop it to iTunes. Dumb.Another Addendum:I'd like to add to some of the "Why do you need this much storage space" reviewers--I have now uploaded my ENTIRE cd collection to my ipod and stored them all in the attic. (Whew! Took a while!) Using the cradle (that was included with this 40 gig photo ipod, but not with others, apparently) I listen to all of them through my home stereo. Pop it in, listen through speakers, take it out and on the road. It's super. (Thanks for asking!)So now I've basically got 30 gig worth of music loaded into a tiny little jukebox. I put away my 100 cd changer and all my cds. Yay!NEARLY SIX YEARS LATER!This is still my pre-eminent music listening device. The battery lasts days. (My iPod touch lasts 4 hours.) Occasional freezes, but re-booting to iTunes helps. I now have over 60 gig of audio media on my laptop, but new versions of iTunes have helped with syncing issues that used to be a problem. (BTW-finally sold my 100 cd changer. CD's are all boxed up in the attic.)

I've been using this now for about two weeks. I'm pretty pleased with it. It popped off my belt once, but I think it was my fault.The Treo is somewhat differently sized than a standard cell phone, so design of this product might be considered awkward. I like being able to rotate the device when I sit down so it doesn't scrunch.I'm a bit worried about the exposed screen, and there's no place to store the ear-peice, so I just leave it in my car.There's no better product out there right now, though...and this beats putting it in your pocket.

This movie was tedious and for a VERY limited audience... I rented it and it was dreary and boring. Too many of these movies are former "Second City" cast members who've forgotten how to write a script. Improv doesn't always work in movies.Also--Fred Willard is NOT FUNNY. He is the "Anti-Funny" and drags down anything he has ever been in. Why a brilliant mind like Martin Mull ever teamed up with that moron is behind me. Christopher Guest is only marginally funny. He likes to play these effete characters, though--ever since Sat. Night Live. What a waste....

When children are told 'no' they have tantrums. That's very similar to Coulter's attitude in this book.Dissent is not treason and should not be mistaken for such. Honest disagreement with our government is as much in our role as Americans as is our loyalty to its causes...and when we disagree, we should take action at the ballot box or the editorial page.If this were not so, we'd still be British Citizens. (Long Live the King!)I'll support Coulter's right to be a loudmouth if she'll support mine.

In response to the nay-sayers who wish to buy only the first film, I'm certain you'll see it sooner or later. As a collection completist, I'm relieved to receive all of them at once and at a reasonable price. The extras are superb.I haven't noticed the framing problems others have mentioned, but I'll watch for them.Muhammed Ali's appearance in the extras for Micheal Fox's Parkinsons fund-raiser was cute, too. Good to see Ali again. (And fun to watch him punch out Fox.)

I run hot and cold with Mel Brooks. The Producers (film AND show)--Brilliant. Young Frankenstein--Perhaps the best comedy ever released on celluloid. But two of his most popular pieces, Blazing Saddles and History of the World, leave me cold. I rate Saddles higher than history, though, and it's a decent evening's entertainment. The Director's narrative on this movie is fun, I didn't realize that Richard Pryor was a writer for the movie. That raised my review by a star.

I'm enjoying having this collection so I can have all of my favorite Stones numbers on one disc in my car. A previous viewer bemoaned the vact that these are &quot;edited versions.&quot; Not entirely true, they're the &quot;single&quot; versions. Singles were always shorter than the album release versions so they'd fit on a 45 rpm record. This often led to a variety of different mixes of one song. (Beatles &quot;Revolution&quot; comes to mind...)Anyhoo...this is a nice disc by Mick and the boys and even though you probably own it all already, you'll probably buy it if you're a fan.

A bad, bad, sense of "contractual obligation" is passed by this. Frank Miller "writes" (and I use this term loosely) an adaptation of something much better done in "Kingdom Come."What is Batman's motivation for the ultimate carnage in issue three? I don't know. Where is the art that made "Dark Knight" the treat that it was? I don't know. Why does Plastic Man's hair keep changing color? I don't know.For those of you gluttonous enough to purchase this anyway--I'll avoid a spoiler and say that the threat to Carrie Kelly in issue three (which appears out of nowhere and is not referred to in either of the previous issues) is the most ridiculous "deus ex machina" of any that I've ever read in a comic book. (A field full of them.)If Frank Miller didn't want to write a sequel to "Dark Knight" he should have refused rather than spreading this swill on toast and calling it a sandwich.I beg you folks, re-read "Kingdom Come," a much worthier sequel to "Dark Knight" and force DC to send unpurchased copies of this [junk] to the shredder.You'll find this in cut-out bins in 3 months at less than cover price....

A great story, poorly lit. There is often too much going on onstage for the cameras to find. (Often, performers stage right are singing while showing stage left.) I got the feeling that the video director had never seen the show before and was covering it as an athletic event.No shots closer than a waist shot, and the lighting is atrocious, no accomodations were made for the television cameras, thus many scenes are hidden in murk.I think that most Broadway shows should be recorded for posterity, but the recording needs to be designed to accomodate the TV format it will be shown on.This one is poorly done.

Chances are, if you're a Townshend fan--You've got acoustic versions of his songs already from &quot;The Secret Policeman's Ball&quot; series. There's one or two things on here I liked, but overall, I was disappointed with Raphael Rudd's inconsistent diddling on the harp.The final three songs on the album are truly hideous. Caterwauling of the same verse over and over while banging on a piano. I was always of the opinion that Pete knew more than three chords, but he didn't use any of them here.Tying &quot;Tattoo&quot; to his religious beliefs reflects poorly on Pete AND ruins a humorous song.I did, however like &quot;Sleeping Dog&quot; and &quot;Let My Love Open the Door&quot;.This album's for completists only.

This movie's okay. I've never understood the appeal of Tolkein.

I've got a suggestion, how about cutting it down to an hour and a half for those of us who didn't like it in the first place?Is there a Mr. Magoo version of this? That would be even better! But would Magoo play Frodo or Gandalf?

For all the hype, I could have seen a much better movie.Much better suited to Saturday Mornings than a treasured space on my DVD shelf.It was too different from the Ultimates to be a good adaptation of that, and too different from the Avengers to be a good representation of that.The included documentary was good, with a great extended interview with Avengers artist extraordinaire George Perez. But I was struck by how much fun I remembered Perez' books being. Remember when comics were fun (and funny?) Something lacking in The Ultimates, the current Avengers books and this DVD.Too bad.

This is a much better adaptation than the later (70's?) version. I show it to my Sophomore English class.It's interesting to cross over our discussion of the novel to the film adaptation, and discuss why the story is re-ordered in the film.It's also interesting to compare to more current war films and discuss differences in film-making.It is my understanding that many of the extras in this film were actual WWI soldiers helping to re-create battle scenes. I feel that many of the best battle scenes ever captured on film were done in this movie. (With very few 'special' effects!)

Bought to go with our in-car audio system. Now we can listen in the house. Agree with a few other posters who say that it's tricky to find an antenna spot.Love the portability and convenience! Antenna cable realllllllly looooooooong, so there is some adaptability.

OK, so I already own everything by BNL. I bought this too. I guess I'm a completist.I'll keep it in the car....I'll be the one singing, loudly, next to you at the stoplight.

...I don't know why I'm surprised about the many occurances of the f-bomb on this CD. I expected pirate songs to be naughty and raunchy--but there's a difference between naughty and filth.I'll wade through it sometime, find the tunes I like and delete the others from iTunes.

I loved these songs when I was a know-it-all teenager. Now, some are funny and some are dated and some are...well...just snarky and sad.I was surprised in re-listening how few of these songs have any real joy in them. The humor is far blacker than I remember.However, &quot;The Elements&quot; is worth the price of admission.

I ordered a blue stylus. I got an orange one. So I thought, &quot;maybe it's blue ink.&quot;It's black.Then I realized they meant that the actual pen was blue.I get it.Pretty useful pen for power palm users, but;I can't figure out how to open it, so when the pen runs out, am I supposed to throw it away? It came, unencumbered by packaging, mailed in 2 foot by 2 foot box. No instructions or refills or anything but an invoice from the shipper. (In other words, they mailed me a ballpoint pen in a HUGE box filled with bubble wrap!)I won't order office supplies on-line again.

A nice effort, and some of the better Brian Wilson we've seen so far. The version of BNL's &quot;Brian Wilson&quot; was funny, but dissapointing in it's length. This probably could have been pared down to one disc rather than two. I like the version I taped for myself to listen to in my car better. (I cut out about half of it.)

So there's no way I'm ever going to buy these as actual comics. Wanting to complete my collection, the "Essential" series is a nice way to read up on stories that were published before I was collecting. (Indeed, in this case, before I was born.)This is cheaply printed and bound, (Mind you this is not necessarily a criticism) the B&W; art starts to hurt your eyes after a few pages. Some of these stories are so badly dated that they're barely worth reading anymore.If you're a fan, you need this, but don't expect any of it to surpass the mediocre.

We just got a new Keureg. When I did the math per cup, I felt bad about a third cup o' joe on Saturdays. Hence, this purchase. It makes my kitchen smell great on a weekend and brews up to eight yummy cups.Clean-up is kinda messy, I can never completely empty the pot.

This was a nice collection of stories. I especially enjoyed Evan Dorkin's humorous contribution. The reprints were unecessary. Any Cap collector worth his salt has them already. Why not give us two more original stories? Or if you MUST reprint something, why not reprint Joe Simon/Jack Kirby's original Cap stories? Or some 40's or 50's stories we've rarely seen?The original stories here, however, are stellar. Worth the asking price for a nice hardcover.

This is a great system. My wife installed XM in her car, and I was so envious I went out and purchaced a Roady. The second XM subscription was less expensive on XM's family plan. I'm looking for excuses to go for rides in my car so I can listen to the XM.(Note to the reviewer who only gets five stations--you need to subscribe before you receive all 200. Otherwise you get a random sample every time you turn the radio on.)

I've been to Disney three times in the past 10 years, each time I've carried a copy of this book. Tear out the pages you need and carry them along. It's invaluable.My fiancee and I are going again in December for our honeymoon. She's never been to Disney and she's reading this constantly this summer. What fun!

A few crashes, a little buggy, and espionage is harder than any other version of this game....but I'm still addicted. The play is smoother, and the automatic upgrades of some of the soldiers/workers is good. I don't miss any of the event movies or other bric-a-brac that I used to turn off on the game.Not a bad purchase (...)

I loved watching this film in the IMAX. It took my breath away. When I saw it again at home, I realized that the story was lacking.That being said--Routh does a terrific job as Supes. Spacey is (of course) incredible and Bosworth is a wet washrag. (66% on casting, eh?)

Remember folks--FIRST was the radio series--Very funny.Then (I believe) came the TV series--Moderately funny and represented here with cheesy effects and some aliens not looking any more rubbery than anything from "Dr. Who."Then came the books--(Funniest of all)This DVD makes me lament the apparent death of the big-budget motion picture of the material that was imminent...

I'd rather see a complete collection of actual classic clips from the show than the brief snippets offered by this DVD. Some songs I wasn't interested in interspersed with cuts of the songs I thought I was buying.DVD master is terrible. This has just been duped from VHS. No clean-up, no menus, no extras.Also no captioning? Shouldn't Sesame Street encourage us to read along?
