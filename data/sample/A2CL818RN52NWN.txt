This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated...

I recently saw this movie for the first time and was pretty surprised at how much I liked it. Even though the plot was weak, I thought the acting was pretty decent. Gorgeous Kim Bassinger plays the sister of Uma Thurman who is a psychiatric patient of Richard Gere. Gere gets involved with Bassinger, who is unhappily married to Eric Roberts, a mafia-type businessman. Bassinger kills him (Roberts); and has Gere and a lawyer-friend of his represent her in a trial. Just when you think that you know how the movie is going to end, then there is another twist. First you think that Thurman is the psychologically ill one, then Bassinger, then both. But it is not as simple as that either. There is a curmudgeonly detective played by the terrific character actor Keith David. Just give this one a chance. You don't have to necessarily own it, but I would say to rent it at least. Make your own "Final Analysis".

The jbl is a very good sounding speaker system...The bass is solid.The highs are open and dynamic...There is a slight lower midrange emphasis...This can appear as a slight hollowness,with a boasted upper bass range...This may not be noticeable on rock or pop,but may be heard,on light classical music...The speakers have an an excellent dynamic range..These speakers will easily produce a clean undistorted output of over 105 db,when used with a good high current amplifier,or receiver,rated for at least 100 watts clean,at 4 ohms,20 to 20,000cps unclipped...The more clean power,the better,the will sound...Most speakers are damaged by low powered receivers, that clip...These speakers are in cherry finish,with free shipping...These speakers are identical,to the black ash version,but with no free shipping...I highly recommend these speakers,when mated with a good subwoofer,4 star rated...A very good deal thank you stewart L.

The jbl E-30 is a very good sounding bookshelf speaker system.The sound is open and clean,with a slightly recessed lower midrange, and slightly bright highs..There is a slight rise in midbass.This makes the speaker sound a bit warm,in my opinion.When these speakers are used with a good subwoofer,your system will really rock...As with all speakers,you should audition them in person,from a retailer,that has a good refund/exchange/return policy, of at least 30 days...I hope my review was helpful for you..I thank you Stewart L.

This is a very good vacuum...It is identical to U5262-90.Despite being very powerful,It shares the same problems of 900..The unit needs to be cleaned,after each use.!!!A real pain!!Further when you empty the dust cup,i put a plastic bag over it,and take it outside of my home so i dont spread dust,inside it...I use a long narrow brush to clean the hepa filter...This takes about 10 minutes or less...So as with the 910.The suction is fantastic..It picks up cat hair quite well...If you willing to put up with the filter cleaning,and spending 20 minutes to vacuum,and 10 minutes,to clean it,its a good deal...The unit is a real pain,but great for cleaning!!!This is a tough call...I conditionally recommend the 910...

An excellent movie with non stop action.Like the energizer bunny,it never stops.Why after hundreds of near death experiences, Bruces injuries are cleared by some form of instant plastic surgery..Pure fun.The one liners are perhaps funnier than the plot..As this is pure entertainment,you are expected to overlook the impossible.As to the plot,despite all the claimed safeguards,i believe could happen.My review applies to the single widescreen edition,released overseas,which has great sound and picture.Thank You.

This is an excellent dvd widescreen portable.It is avaible in pearl or black...The unit works with its supplied battery..You get about 3 hours of use on one charge...The unit also comes with an ac adapter/charger...A car adapter is included,with this package...Mine was skip free,with a good picture and sound,with its built in little speakers...You can feed your stereo and tv from this portable for better performace...The unit states there is no skip protection,a consideration for road trips...My unit did not skip under these conditions...Please note most portable dvd players,are not as rugged as they should be...You cannot charge and watch a dvd at the same time...The unit will work off ac power...If you want to charge the battery,while on ac,you would need,a second a/c adapter...I hope my review was helpful to you...Please note when purchasing,please buy from a retailer with a good refund/exchange policy of at least 30 days...Thank you stewart L...Update 2/16/06...Amw is out of business..They dont answer their phones,and this item is being sold as is by most retailers,despite listing this item as new..My units work well,but like many others,you will find you cannot get the set fixed for free...It is common for some retailers to sell repacked refurbished,and factory B,and rejects as new...Always check your purchases carfully.. look for extra lables or repair tags,that will show your item might not be new...I hope my update was helpful,for all concerned..

This is is one of the best video transfers,i have ever seen.from the technical standpoint unbelievable.This movie was produced in 1939.if you look for glitches,you might find some.Just like gone with the wind.They just dont make movies like these anymore.Today hollywood churns out movies,mostly for targeted audences,and making the maximum buck.Yes we have several blockbuster movies a year.still i feel there a lost art for todays movies.i didnt talk about the movie plot.i thought it was more important to talk about how great movies used to be,and can be again.

When lovely Theresa, who is black, brings home her fiance, Simon Green, who is white, for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary; her father understandably does not appreciate this fact because she failed to mention his race to him. Bernie Mac, who is the father, goes out of his way to make sure that his daughter does not marry Simon. There are some surprises and even after all the negatives, her father somehow does warm up to Simon. All-in-all, the movie works well and is a barrel of laughs. Highly recommended.

This subwoofer is fantastic.Polk has always designed their speakers to be as musical and true to the actual performace,wheather it be classical,jazz,rock,pop,or a dvd movie..The bass is full and natural,with tremendous bass slam.When there is no bass you wont hear any...But when bass is present,watch out!!!There are many subs that produce one note bass,and sound quite muddy...Not the polk...You just hear the music or movie as it was intended to be heard...The subwoofer is compact,and doesnt take up alot of space...I find the polk perfect for tight spaces,and fits perfectly,in my nyc apartment.I hope my review was helpful for you..I thank you Stewart L.

I wrote a review on this two years ago but it vanished!Yentl is an exellent widesreen dvd in stereo,although the dilogue is not as clean as the musical scores.This dvd is in region 2 and requires a multiregion dvd player such as the pioneer dv383s,set to playback ntsc at the output.While the studios argue and play games through 2007,this release will be an excellent choice.Your standard dvd player wont play this disc.Further,the studios will only allow you to buy the crappy fullscreen vhs version.My last review was removed.You cant handle the truth you see.I hope you read this before amazon removes it!The french version is better than the full screen uk edition.I own both discs and the crappy vhs movie 5 star rated.Thank you from Stewart L.02/19/07 1057am est

This is my third palm pilot...I found it very easy to set up,and easy to use...My unit has been trouble free..My previous units had memory wipe problems..My cell phone rang,and my palm was blank...Customer service was lacking to say the least...I received this one as a gift...,so im happy for now...After reading the reviews,from my fellow reviewers,i can see the unit is good,if you are lucky...If you purchase the palm,please make sure they have a good return/refund/exchange policy,before purchasing...These units are very sensitive to static electricity...This may explain the data memory issues,that some people have experienced...I thank you stewart l 12/07/05.

This is an excellent boxed set,but the sound is fuzzy and most tracks sound like they were washed with clorox.This is a common problem with copy protected discs.As i own the original sets on rhino and the Lp versions,i am very disappointed with the MONO FOLDED IMAGE PRESENTATION PROVIDED BY THE RHINO ENGINEERS..In no way is this collection true to the original recordings..Yes the music is there and if you cant hear the copy protection distortion,go for it...If you dont believe me and you own the original rhino recordings,just compare them yourselves..And to the RHINO ENGINEERS..TAKE YOUR ORIGINAL RECORDINGS AND COMPARE THEM.UNLESS YOU ARE DEAF COMPARE THEM.YOU WILL BE SHOCKED!!!!!!THANK YOU!I would wait until they are remastered in clean stereo sound,without the crappy distortion on this one.

These speakers produce very good sound.[...].Yes you can buy speakers ,that are smaller with more accurate sound,but for those wanting big sound in a large room,these just might be right for you.These speakers are quite tall but are fairly slim in width. You will need a lot of clean power,but the payoff is the speakers are very open dynamic and a little bright.I recommend you use a receiver or seperate power amplifiers,that have a more subdued ,or netural sound ,to give a more musical presentation..I intend to use a pair in my basement.I highly recommend these speakers and i rate them 5 stars...I thank you.

This is a nice album if you are just looking for the hits.For top notch sound,go with the cameo parkway edition of bobby rydell,its much better.I bought the marginal disc,because it had a couple of songs missing from the cameo release...The sound on this disc is compressed and dull sounding,and was not mastered off the original master tapes...A better choice is the cameo 25 song release...Thank you Stewart L.

This program offers full system protection,from spyware adware,keyloggers,browser hijackers,and the new rootkit threats...All of the above threats can cause identity theft...Why on one machine i own,it removed 636 threats,including dialers and worse...Spyware protection is just as important as antivirus software,and a good firewall...Why spyware threats are worse than viruses,because,they disable your protection systems..There is a crossover in whats a virus and whats spyware?...Also the use of window washer,by webroot can be very helpful.spysweep is highly recommended a must.

The sony is an excellent receiver,delivering high power and good sound at an affordable price.The sony is rated at 90 watts x6 40 to 20,000 cps at 8 ohms at 1000 cps.The full rated power of this set is more like 70 watts x 6 at 8 ohms.As with most receivers the power ratings are overly optimistic.They test the power with one or two channels driven.If you were to drive all six channels full spectrum simultaniously,the power delivered,would drop considerably. The unit would go into protection and current limit, or shut down Since most of us use subwoofers,this fact is really moot.The fm tuner is quite sensitive.The receiver sounds open and clean. Just dont expect top notch sound in such an affordable receiver.There are plenty of connection options.This unit is a good deal.I just got one for a non audiophile friend. I thank you Stewart L.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT RECEIVER THAT PRODUCES 100W X 6,WITH VERY LOW DISTORTION.YOU HAVE NEARLY EVERY INPUT YOU COULD POSSIBLY NEED,IN A STANDARD HOME THEATER,SET-UP.I ALSO LIKE THAT THIS UNIT HAS A 4 OHM LOW IMPEDENCE SWITCH.THIS IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE MANY SPEAKERS RATED AT 8 OHMS,MAY DROP TO AS LOW AS 2 OHMS,OR EVEN LOWER.MANY AMPLIFIERS OVER-HEAT,OR GO INTO PROTECTION,OR CURRENT LIMITING.THIS COULD TURN THE AVERERGE RECEIVER INTO A 1 WATT AMPLIFER,IN THE REAL WORLD.WHEN AN AMPLIFIER CLIPS YOUR SPEAKERS MAY BE DAMAGED.ACTUALLY THE MORE CLEAN POWER YOU HAVE,THE LESS CHANCE YOU HAVE TO DAMAGE YOUR EQUIPMENT.NOW THE YAMAHA HTR5850 FITS THE BILL.IT HAS HIGH POWER, HIGH CURRENT,OUTPUT,AND LOW DISTORTION.YOU CAN ALSO LISTEN TO XM-SATELLITE RADIO.WITH AN ADDITIONAL ADAPTER.I FOUND THE YAMAHA TO BE EASY TO SET UP.THIS IS A COMPUTERIZED SET UP FOR THE SOUND,HOWEVER YOU CAN SET THINGS UP MANUALLY,IF YOU WISH.YOU SHOULD USE A Y ADAPTER FROM THE SUBWOOFER OUT TO YOUR SUBWOOFER,IF IT HAS A DUAL STEREO INPUTS.THIS IS JUST A RECOMMENDATION,AS I THINK IT IMPROVES PERFOMANCE.THIS RECEIVER IS FANTASTIC.THE SOUND IS STUNNING,WITH MOVIES,AND MUSIC.THE YAMAHA IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY ME.YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH THIS RECEIVER.

What a nightmare.Imagine everything that 2006 was and more bloat to spare.Just read the reviews for norton 2006.Symantec has learned nothing except,how to charge you for the privlege of getting their products to work.The protection may stop working at anytime,without warning.Of course norton will tell you everything is fine.I dare you norton to offer free live telephone support for the life,of your customers subscriptions,like leginamate decent companies offer.Just say no to this junkware.If your programs are working just renew your subscription.Thank you Stewart L.Update 10/24/06.You should know that webroot spysweeper is offering antivirus protection with their antispyware program.Of course symantec would seek to block a competitor.Symantec programs are buggy and unstable to begin with.And Webroot offers free live telephone support and really cares about its customers,unlike nortons get out your credit card support system!!! I am sure this program will work for some without a hitch.But just wait until you do have a problem!!!Many people raved about norton 2006,then reality set in.Well I hope this year is different.Thank You!Update 11/15/06.On my my 3 machines,the intrusion detection has reverted back to sept 22,2006.I wonder how many machines out there have old intrusion detections,running on their machines.This means you not protected against new viruses worms etc.Of course all is reported okey!!!Update 02/17/07.The intrusion error problem can be fixed with complete removel of this program and using their symart,or shall i say their partial removal tool!I am amazed at how many people get suckered into buying this program!It is terrible.And yes please continue to check your intrusion signatures.They may not be current on your computers! Update 02/19/07.My intrusions Detections failed to update.I was told by symantec to uninstall and reinstall again This means if i continue to use their program i have to reinstall monthly.!!!Updates itself great product Not!!

Now first of all, i am a fan of the orignial series,but i like the new show even better than the original. As stated by many others,the season is not complete.yes i will buy the set.I am not happy about getting half a season for the price of one.further,the movie studios pull this on many other tv show boxed sets. Some sets are even perish forbid edited.Now we should all demand full seasons on the movies we buy,or dont buy them.i know,you half to have this now.When i buy coffee i want a full cup,not half filled!!!!but i am buying this alas.i am giving the set,a 4 star rating.!!!

This album features,all the rightious brothers,top ten hits,and some lesser ones..The album is very similar to the rhino anthology,that was discontinued,long ago...Now all the music is there...As ive found with other universal masters releases,there is a kind of haze,and grit to the sound,rendering the music,well dull and lifeless,yet bordering on shrillness...This is copy protection distortion...This stuff is on most cd,out there,and probibly,wont be noticed,by most listeners,who just want to hear the music...i give you my opinion of the sound quality,of this two disc set...If you own the original verve 23 song collection of the rightious,you would hear the difference in sound right away!!!I own this disc set and find it very enjoyable..I cant tell you just how great this disc is...5 stars and a must for your music collection...Thank you stewart L.

The frigdare a/c is a very good unit when purchased on sale...I purchased locally,to avoid the shipping damage that others have suffered with.The unit cools well and has a remote.The unit is very noisy even on low...The unit is very cheaply made...For 5 bucks more frigidare could have included real insulation,instead of the cheap cardbord,used in this...If noise is not an issue,this is a good unit to keep cool with.I payed 169.99 including installation....Now the prices are up for the summer sales!!

Sea of love is one my favorite phycological thrillers of all time.The performances,are steamy,warm,heart wrenching,with a believable plot that will keep you on the edge of seat.There are many twists and turns in the story,that will keep you guessing as to who did what.al pacino,and ellen barken,give stela performances...A must have for your dvd collection.5 star rated I thank you Stewart L. 03/08/06.

Symantec is trying to produce better products this year.However their tech and customer support is very very poor out of India. Symantec is set up to charge first and talk later.This has cost symantec customers much grief,and many failed installs,to boot!!.I have a copy of 2007,but uninstalled when my computer crashed.They tried to charge me,but i refused.When you have a failed install or older versions on the machine,you need to use Their special clean-up tools.I would wait a few months for symantec to iron out this years bugs.Thank you Stewart L.

This program is terrible,but by amazon erasing all the reviews you may be fooled into buying this Dont buy it and file a complaint with amazon for censorship of the truth...Update 7/19/07 The reviews have been restored,but install at your own risk! I would not recommend this program to my worst enemy. Like norton antivirus 2007 and norton 360,you may suffer system crashes computer damage,or a virus that norton misses. Avoid! You have been warned.

This is an excellent hdtv.While flat screen tv sets are really cool, when it comes to performace,the crt is king.With crt based tv sets you get much better black levels than any lcd,or plasma set.When it comes to viewing angles lcd,are just not as good as a crt.Now this set takes up alot of real estate,if perfomance maters more than share size,this is the tv for you.I am using the sony 27hs420,the sony 34hsn420 and the 32hs420 in a third room.My favorite is the 27hs420,now discontinued.The last two tv sets were top rated in a major consumer magazine.The 32hs420 is easy to set up.It has a very good remote,and the picture gourgious...I Highly recommend and own this tv...Please make sure the retailer has a good refund/exchange policy of at least 30 days...I thank you Stewart L.

If you are looking for the perfect gift for those who remember the sweet sounds of LP's,this may fit the bill.There are no tone controls,ans two stereo speakers rated at 2.5 watts each.the sound is well balanced.You will need to assemble the base.Please check very carfully for shipping damage.If the unit is dropped in shipping,you might have problems.Please make sure you have a 30 day/refund/exchange,policy in place,before buying.Now to continue with my review.The unit comes with a 3 disc cd changer.The set also has a full function cassette recorder,and am/fm stereo radio.The unit has a 3 speed turntable/with a ceramic cartidge.I recommend obtaining an extra needle or cartridge,as these units tend to diasapear quickly,without parts support.I am looking for an extra cartrige myself.The unit sure looks nice.They are using real wood and manufacture quality is good.I just bought a second unit for my elderly aunt.I hope my second unit will be as nice as the first unit.For nostalgic folks,i give the unit 4 stars!!!!For those needing a replacement needle or cartridge get the items the jx-cd1 cartridge with stylus.or just the needle jx-cd2 these can be ordered at www.jWIN.com.For anyone having tracking problems,there is a screw to turn clockwise and a needle protector,must removed of course. The base assembly is a pain.you can leave it off for table top operation...I hope my review was helpful Enjoy!!!!thank you Stewart L.03/14/06 updated.

Im am using the webroot desk top firewall on one machine as an alternative to the bloated symantec firewall.I find it keeps my laptop with a 60 gig hard drive both protected,and super fast.Machine start up in standby is 5 seconds.A full start-up is less than one minute.The firewall lets more stuff through,but keeps the junk out.Yes webroot offers free technical support and they will walk you through redownloads,or installations.Webroot offers real support with spyware addware malware and hybrid trojans that are ignored by the competition Webroot cares about its customers,and yes they know what they are doing unlike that big antivirus company,that doesnt care.5 star recommended.

When you buy a refurbished unit,you never know what you are getting...Sometimes returned or damaged units are repacked,and sent off to the next customer...At times a product is damaged in shipping,hence a unit is received doa,with broken parts,thanks to shippers throwing the box around 10 feet from the truck to the sidewalk smashed...In other words buying reburbished is a roll of the dice at best...This is my experience with reburbished products,including the dmr-75VS...My unit works well and,makes excellent copies,and easy to use...I bought the unit reburbished,only because,they ran out of new units,as the unit was rated quite well in consumer reports...MY advice is "only buy this from a dealer with a good return -refund policy."

Well I have listened to these speakers at length.They are good for gaming and non critical listening.The sound is warm and full.Hey At this price point you cant expect high end sound!! That will cost you thousands of dollars.The subwoofer emits an annoying buzz on some classical music and some acoustical music.I would suggest you listen to these speakers before purchasing.As a bonus you get precut speaker cables and a subwoofer cable+ Free Shipping!,which was the deal breaker for me.I am buying another as a gift.Again Dont Expect Too much And You Wont Be Disapointed!Thank You from Stewart L 02/09/07

I OWN THE BOX SET OF THESE MOVIES BECAUSE I AM A HUGE FAN OF MS. STREISAND'S.EVEN THOUGH I'M GIVING THE SET 5-STARS, I REALLY DIDN'T ENJOY "THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES". I FELT THAT STREISAND MISCAST BRIDGES IN THE ROLE OPPOSITE HER. I ALSO FELT THAT THE PLOT DIDN'T HOLD UP."THE PRINCE OF TIDES" IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MOVIES. IT PACKS AN EMOTIONAL WALLOP. THE ACTING WAS TOP-NOTCH AND I WAS RIVETED TO MY SEAT. STREISAND'S DIRECTION WAS RIGHT ON TARGET; AND REALLY GRASPED THE AUTHOR'S CONVEYANCE OF THE SUBJECT. I WAS VERY MOVED BY THE PERFORMANCES AND THE MOVIE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."THE WAY WE WERE" IS A REAL CLASSIC TEAR-JERKER. I'VE SEEN THIS FILM AT LEASE 20 TIMES AND I GET EMOTIONAL EVERYTIME THE 'PLAZA SCENE' PLAYS. THE COUPLING OF STREISAND AND REDFORD IS A "MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN" EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED IN SO MANY OF THEIR BELIEFS. THE BACKDROP OF THE POLITICALLY-CHARGED MCCARTHY ERA KEEPS IT INTERESTING. BUT TO WATCH THEIR INTERACTION IS VERY SEDUCTIVE--EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY. PLEASE CHECK THIS ONE OUT TOO.

This is denons top of the line 10 channel receiver boasting 170 times 10,..all channels driven simutaniously...Most receivers fail this test,and and will deliver only a fraction of their rated power or shut down...yamaha,pioneer and sony,among others,boast top of the line receivers,such as this....The denon is is only for a select number of audiophiles,who need and appreciate the best...This unit is not for a person happy with a five hundred dollar receiver,where most specifications are fudged,and loaded with distortion and current limiting...Please dont get me wrong .Main stream videophiles,and those on a budget can always find excellent sounding components,on the cheap...I and many college students,put,audio and video systems together,for as little as 250 bucks. These systems sound great!!!!I remember the nad 3020 intergrated amp,that produced 20 watts times two... this unit put 2000 dollar systems to shame and was more powerful than a phase linear 375.watt times two amplifer... that nad 3020 embarassed,the whole audio industry,back in 1976-1979...The people who remember this will appreciate the denon...If you feel the denon is over kill please!!!" just ignore this review ",and look elsewhere...There are plenty of moderatly priced systems out there.This set as good as many seperate systems selling for 10 thousand bucks.Plllllllllease audition at a reputable audio video salon...and have it professionally installed in your home. have full exchange/refund privleges,if you purchase this unit...Dont forget you can get a fairly good used car for the asking price of the denon...

I owned this this player.It could never play a dvd,without skipping...I exchanged,the unit 3x,with no luck.Finally,it only played cd discs...I sold this set for 5 bucks,at a flea market!!If you see this model,run the other way...Check out the feedback,from my fellow,reviewers...I hope this helped you..Thank you Stewart L.

Attn to all concerned the news may be out soon when the dust clears...copy protection has been placed on other brands of cd and movies out there...The bad sound you may hear on some cd s The fuzzy or skipping video you play is spun from the same idea...to stop copying of music and movies period...Everything else has been said by others in the know...Your computer may be infected for playing a movie or cd two years ago...More research and patches are needed by yesterday...

Philips continues to sell a unit that is seriously flawed,with terrible quality control and technical suuport that is lacking.A telephone call wont fix junkware.I owned this set for a week.I had bought this from a different retailer.I was lucky.The retailer took it back.I tried a second unit no go.I dumped this model for a good panasonic model...I do not recommend this unit,sadly,because it could have been something really special.I hope my review was helpful to you...Stewart L.

This is an excellent subwoofer.I am using them on two of my home theater systems. polk speakers,have always been known for natural reproduction of sound wheather it be a movie..rock.. folk ..jazz,..rap...pop..classical..or electronica...When no bass is present,there wont be any,unlike the one note boom woofers,that are muddy or thick...With the polks,you are at the movies,or theater,or a rock concert...For the ultimate in home theater,use a stereo pair..Wow either way a super subwoofer...5 star rated.

A GREAT SET ,BUT HAS SOME KIND OF UGLY DISTORTION THRU MOST OF THE TRACKS.SOME SOUND PROCESSOR RUN AMOCK.THIS RUINS MY MUSICAL EXPERIENCE,WHICH IS SAD.PERHAPS THEY WILL REMASTER THIS COLLECTION,IF ENOUGH PEOPLE COMPLAIN.I GET A HEADACHE TRYING TO LISTEN.I HEARD THIS TYPE OF DISTORTION ON SOME C D PLAYERS IN 1983.WHEN WE HAD PERFECT SOUND FOREVER,THATS WHY SOME PEOPLE BOUGHT EXPENSIVE PLAYERS,BACK THEN.I SENT THIS BACK IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A CLEANER PRESSING.I HOPE THE NEW ONE IS BETTER.

THE SONG SELECTION IS GOOD.WOULD HAVE COULD HAVE MIGHT HAVE,IF NOT SO SHORT ON SONGS.AS LONG AS CUSTOMERS PURCHASE ALBUMS,WITH AS LITTLE AS FIVE TO TWELVE SONGS,THE RECORD PRODUCERS WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS.THIS WAY YOU BUY PART ONE TWO OR THREE,PAY 3 TIMES AS MUCH FOR MATERIAL THAT COULD BE RELEASED ON ONE ALBUM.A BUY OR HOLD IS UP TO YOU .

These bulbs are 130 volt standard bulbs,that are available in size 40,60 100 with several three way bulb sizes...If you have a problem of frequent light bulb burnout...This type of bulb should solve the problem...Most areas of the country have wild voltage swings...Low voltage,then high...This is one reason you use a surge protector for your computer,or home stereo...When a bulb is rated at 130 volts,instead of 120 they can last years,instead of weeks...These bulbs will give off a little less light,but you wont be changing bulbs every two weeks...130 volt bulbs are also available for most types of outdoor lighting,and more..Again a problem solver 5 star rated thank you stewart L.

I had to perform a clean windows install,and installed norton 2005 antivirus and the 2005 norton firewall...Now all is well...? we have to wait 15 days to see if the registration fails...You install at your own risk...Upgrading is not always better...You be the judge of this.

The sharp r-230kk is an excellent microwave oven.I bought one for myself and another as a gift.Both were delivered double boxed to protect the unit.The only downside is the display is rather dim even in bright light.The cooking buttons are placed in a rather odd order,which takes some getting used too.Foods soups popcorn and the like cook to perfection.The oven door is a little clunky,but what do you expect for 70 bucks.A best buy with free super saving shipping.Thank you for reading my review 07/25/07.

I was delightfully surprised at how much I liked this quirky romantic dramedy. Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet really worked well off of each other. Some of the plot was corny and unbelievable, but I still would recommend it. I also liked all the cinematography around New York City and other cities in the movie. Even though it is not the greatest flick, there are a lot worse movies out there that make it big. If you are looking for fluff, see it.

FOR MUSIC THE POLKS ARE BETTER THAN THE VELODYNES,IN MY OPINION.A GOOD DEAL.

This air conditioner is good for cooling a small to medium size room.I got on sale locally for 139.95,including installation...The unit on low cool sounds like a hair dryer,and its hard to carry out a conversation on anything but low cool.The side panels are very flimsey...Internal insulation is like cardboard...For about 5 bucks more frigidare could have made this model quiter,but being made in china on the cheap,their corperate profits are more important than quality...To my fellow reviewers,you may have received a ship damaged unit.I wouldnt pay more than 129.99, for this unit..As noted by a fellow reviewer,in the electronic control version.."This Unit Should Come With Free Air Plugs" Thank You from Stewart L.

"Crash" was one of the most thought-provoking movies I've seen in ages. It shows the insidiousness of prejudice prevailing among all of us. The problem is that most people are not willing to discuss this deep-rooted problem in our society. Maybe this movie will bring it out into the open more. I hope so. I know that this is a clich&eacute;, but even if one person can be influenced positively by this powerful film; then it is worth it. Run out and buy this one!!!

This receiver is an excellent choice as the center piece of your home theater experience.the amplifer section features high current high power low impedence drive.The unit sports a 4 ohm switch,which helps in driving difficult speaker loads,or mutiple speaker connections...the yamaha delivers real world power into difficult loads.Many receivers such as sony, wimp out because of current limiting protection circuits,that are built into most recivers.I use this as my second stereo hook-up,and i really find it a pleasure to watch movies or listen to music..this model has been dicontinued,but is still available

The jbl E90 is a very good sounding speaker system.At 400 bucks for the pair,this is very good deal.The speakers are a little bright and are best used with neutral sounding seperate amplifers or a high current receiver rated for more than 100 watts at 4 ohms...If the amplifier has a 2 ohm ,high current rating,thats good too.Most amps clip or limit without 4 drive,and contrary to popular belief,A low powered or current limited amp can damage your speakers more easily than a amp. that is loafing along.You will need a good subwoofer with these speakers..I highly recommend these speakers. !Enjoy!.I thank you Stewart L.

This is an excellent live concert,volume one of two,originally aired on pbs...This concert contains 24 plus hits,and many musical clips of your favorite stars from the fifties era...It was very important,to get these great artists,on stage to help keep the music alive...Many of the artists are slowly passing in time...It is very important for people from future generations,be,able to hear this wonderful music...From any generation,whatever music you like today may sound weird or dated to future generations....Everything played today will be tomorows oldies...I love and own both albums from pbs..This set makes an excellent gift. 5 star rated...I thank you stewart L.

Today all electronic equipment is constantly under attack..Power surges and sags,chip away at your equipment..This causes your system to drop in performace.Lock-ups and system failures.Further,radio frequncy interferance may also cause damage to your equipment...For more extreme situations,power conditioners,and back-up battery systems may be needed...Basically if your not using a spike protector,you will never realize the full potential of your your audio video or computer systems....I highly recommend this unit to you,to protect your investment...Thank you stewart L.

This is an excellent pda,from palm...I received this as a christmas gift...My last two palms died at an early age...They had memory wipe problems...My cell phone rang,my screen went blank...As my fellow reviewers have noted.Their customer service is terrible...Ive had no problems,since receiving my palm...I have noticed,that this unit like all palms,seem very sensitive to static electricity...This might explain some of the negitive experiences palm customers,have had with their products..I love the palm...Please make sure that the retailer has a good refund/return/exchange poicy of at least 30 days,As most problems show up in the first 30 days or 90 days after purchase...4 star recommended...I thank you stewart L.

This album contains all the major hits,and some of the lessor known tracks.All the songs sound great.This album will be be an excellent addition for martha reeves and the vandella fans,of all ages.As with most current cd releases,it contains copy protection,that tends to mess up the sound,for those with golden ears,and high audiophile standards.The sound is not as crisp as some of the older releases,but is still quite enjoyable!!!I highly recommend this two disc set.I thank you Stewart L.

This sony boombox has excellent sound and and volume,at any setting.It will produce stadium loud. Really.The unit weighs 20 lbs plus with the bateries,and is much larger than the dimensions,listed on amazon...If you are short on space you can go with the sony cfd10,which has similar sound,and is more compact...I highly recommend the cfd-G500,but remember the unit is very large and heavy,if you purchase this unit...Also please checkout the sony in person,as the pictorial,doesnt really do the unit justice...When the subwoofer system is operational,it will display flashing L.E.D's.This might be annoying,but oh what super bass...Finally Please purchase from a retailer with a good refund/return/exchange policy...I thank you...Stewart L.

The sony stereo radio cassette recorder,produces top notch sound for a portable...The sound is full bodied and warm sounding...Please dont expect high fidelity performace.After all this is a portable radio...The quality of most boomboxes,seems to have dropped,over the years...This unit should provide you with pleasent sound at the office,or at home,for non critical listening...I bought this unit as a christmas gift...I feel the sony is overpriced at [...] the suggested list price by sony...If it sold for [...],i would have given it 5 stars and bought a second set for myself...I thank you stewart L.

Radio inside is about a love triangle.Two brothers are in love with the same girl...There is much grief as both brothers try to deal with the accidental drowning,of their father,one year ago.As life guards they feel very guilty that the couldnt save their dad...One brother trys a more traditional job in business,while the other,remains part of the surfing scene so to speak...The movie was a little strange and depressing,but i really enjoyed this flic...I highly recommend this disc...please note the movie is in pal region 2...You will need a muti-region,dvd player that can output to auto ntsc,such as the pioneer dvd 373..Thank you stewart L.Update the dvd will most likly be released in 2010 along with yentl and men dont leave..The us studios are only in it for the fast buck,turning out junk to targeted audiences and ignoring the classics,as usual,an example A tree grows in brooklyn foreign release feb 2005.Us release 2012????? and counting.

The movie Radio Inside is a real tear jerker.There is a love triagle between two brothers,and a woman.The movie shows how the two brothers deal with guilt,and pain,at the loss of their father.One brother seeks work far away from the pain.The other meets the pain head on.I enjoyed this movie very much,and highly recommend this flic...The movie is an import.You will need a multi-region,mutizone zone dvd.player that outputs to ntsc...The movie is {region two{,and wont play on standard dvd players...Thank you Stewart L.

First of all these speakers really rock and roll.They reproduce music and movies of all types,equally well.the bass is powerful and dynamic, even without a subwoofer.the highs and midrange are lively. I find the speakers to be transparent,meaning the speakers seem to dissapear,leaving you good sound. This is what high end speakers do. At JBL'price point a steal to buy 5 star recommended. O yes dont forget free shipping as of 11/11/05.

The JBL.E80 have very good sound.They produce a very deep and open soundstage...The speakers have excellent,if not slighly recessed bass peformance...The highs are a little bright,but are easily tamed with a twist of high-frequncy cut, on your tone controls. Most people will like the sound,because of hearing loss,caused by listening to music via portable media,at high volumes,including myself...The speakers,when mated with a good subwoofer will truly rock...Please listen to these speakers at a friend or retailer to make sure you like the sound of these speakers...When purchasing please make sure they have a good refund/exchange policy of at least 30 days...I thank you stewart L.

Let me tell you.This is a great album.Ricky,sings most of his top 10 hits,and a few lesser known tracks...I am a fan of fifties music,and television shows...When i saw the dvd release for sale,i jumped at ordering it...I got to see the pre-release,and had seen the videos on pbs...I wish i had ordered the pbs version,as i would have had this dvd a few months ago.Both versions are identical!!!..The sound and video quality,could be a little better...and maybe,a fully restored release might be in the offering in the future...All in all 5 star rated...!!A must have for fifties music collectors.!!Enjoy!Thank you stewart L.

An excellent sounding subwoofer with real jaw dropping bass.This unit is manufactured in china and is based on the sunfire subwoofer,but mass produced to offer a similar sound,but scaled down with less power and a single 10 inch speaker.The unit is excellent,but i would recommend using a seperate power strip to turn the sub on last,when powering on your stereo system.When you are shutting off your stereo,turn the subwoofer off first,through a recommended power strip.Carver and sunfire subwoofers are very sensitive and could fail from turn on,turn off power surges.Again highly recommended.I own this sub.Thank you from Stewart.L

I bought two of these units refurbished from a major retailer,at christmas time.The picture is excellent and the sound good for a portable.Now when you buy used or refurbed,you are rolling the dice as to wheather you will get a good unit.My units turned out to be multiregion and multizone,which means it plays every disc from around the world.I cant promise you these results,but that the unit will play region 1 only.This unit is the amw 510.This model and the amw520 may still be available on ebay.Good Luck and please make sure the retailer has a good refund policy of at least 30 days.Thank you from Stewart L 02/22/07

The sirius stb2 boombox has excellent sound and is sold packaged together with the companion tuner as a limited edition package for about 119.99 on line,at circuitcity.The unit listed on amazon is for the boombox only.Beware there is alot of price gouging on this unit.Further this model is being discontinued,and is being closed out at radioshack.Good deals may also be found on ebay.The boombox has excellent bass punch,and clean highs for a compact unit.There are no tone controls to drop the bass,a minor drawback.There is no place to stow the antenna.I wish the antenna was built in.Xm has been able to do this on several of their portables.Well i took advantage of the christmas sales and got the complete package for 89 bucks.Shop around if possible and please make sure you purchase from a retailer that has defective return privleges of at least 30 days.Thank you from Stewart L. 2/5/07

Imagine you could get two super movies for the price of one well here it is.Sony pictures has released Be Cool/Get Shorty,as a two pack.Wow..Now you can double the comedy,see extreme blackmail,pain and loads of fun.Mix in a really great cast,and you get an ultra recomended dvd disc set.Yes it is silly and not always believable,but remember we see a movie to be entertained.And oh yes you wont be disappointed...I give this set a 5+ rating!!!Enjoy!! I thank you Stewart L.

This is a plain iced tea much like lipton teas,with no extra flavoring...The tea is strong,and a little bland...You may need to add sweet n low or splenda to the mix...You might have to add a little more water than the instructions indicate,based on your personel preferences...Crytal light is sold in most supermarkets.

The symphonic SD200E. is a good budget dvd player,for your non videophile friends...The machine is produced by Funai,the company that makes sylvania products ...If you dont have high expectations,you will be very happy...This brand has been more reliable,than other lesser name brands...The bottom line this dvd player works well,while many other units fail...If it breaks you throw it away...This unit makes an excellent christmas gift.4 star rated...Thank you stewart L.

THIS ALBUM CONTAINS 20 GREAT TRACKS OF HERB ALPERT.THIS ALBUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TWO DISC SET WITH A WIDER RANGE OF SELECTIONS.SOME OF THE TRACKS ARE MONO INSTEAD OF STEREO.NOW I KNOW ALL THE SELECTIONS WERE IN STEREO ,WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED ON LP,I OWN SEVERAL,AND THEY ARE ALL IN STEREO.THE ALBUM IS A LITTLE MUDDY,BUT OTHERWISE QUITE ENJOYABLE. RECOMMENDED.I OWN THIS CD

This is a very nice toaster,that works very well.This model received good ratings from a major consumer magazine...The color of the toaster is jet black,with a retro look...If the color doesnt math your decor,the identical unit is available in kichen white model number 22450,for the same price...A solid value 4 star rated...Thank you Stewart L.

I FIND THE VERBATIM MEDIA BLANKS TO BE AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPUTER BURNERS,AND HOME DVD RECORDERS,THAT USE THESE BLANKS.WHEN YOU BURN YOUR HOME MOVIES OR DATA FILES,THEY ARE THERE TO STAY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,AND INEXPENSIVE.

This is an excellent movie where i believe your dreams may come true.Such warmth,love and charm.While this might be considered a chic flick.I think all couples should watch this movie together.Lets hope the us studios release enchanted cottage,and oh yes please dont forget about the us release of a tree grows in brooklyn,shirley valentine,yentl,and of course flower drum song,on DVD!!!!

THIS IS PART TWO OF MUSIC SCENE.!!!SEE MY PART ONE REVIEW.THE SHOW FEATURED MANY ROCK GROUPS,COMEDY ,FOLK AND MUCH MORE.THE SHOW TRIED TO APPEAL TO A YOUNGER AUDIENCE.THIS WAS UNUSUAL FOR ABC IN 1969.THE SHOW BOMBED,IN SHORT ORDER.1/1/2 YEARS TOTAL,AS I REMEMBER BACK THEN.THEY TRIED TO HAVE THE SUCCESS OF HUABLOO, BUT THIS NEVER HAPPENED REGRETFULLY...THERE ARE SOME VERY RARE MOMENTS MAKING THIS SHOW,PART ONE AND TWO,A MUST FOR YOUR DVD COLLECTION. RECOMMENDED. I OWN THIS DISC.

This album takes you thru the 50,s 60,s,and 70,s all grade a hits.The songs on this 6 cd set will trully show you what radio was about,before the music became formatted,and pre-packaged,like many of todays radio stations.In new york city,we no longer have an oldies station,nor even a country music channel,on fm...How sad.

I find that the norton 2006 slows the machine down considerably.The easy configeration programing may open port 1024 to allow access of stealth net spy,when you try to send a fax.or print.The 2005 norton firewall blocked this threat,and warned you to keep it blocked as a severe threat...this program blocks aol music,but allows some third party programs to install without warning...Symantec tech support was as stated by my many fellow reviewers,"NOT VERY HELPFUL AT ALL" One of my 5 machines has norton 2004 antivirus,with the windows firewall.This works better than a machine that on high speed,with 120 gig hard drive and 2 gigs of memory.Why my powerful machine acts like its on dial-up,yet,the machine with older norton 2004 is faster even on dial up back-up...I have to advise everyone please dont use at this time.Stick with your older version of norton until,they can fix their software glitches.Avoid please

Product crashed my machine. They wanted to charge for service. I switched back to norton 2005 that worked okey power hog a 30 second sign on took 4 minutes and crahed aol. I had to reinstall my internet service... This must be a beta program with new customers as testers just look at the reviews for their 2005 products......"Warning if you have a virus or have had live-update disabled."..the symantec lustsetup on site is outdated..you may need the oct.12th 2005 version".This applies to all 2006 versions...The automated fix did not work for me beacuse it sent me an old outdated download.This download disabled norton .I had to search the symantec site for the correct download..Once installed norton worked okey...You need to check live update,daily,and check your statistics,for problems.Norton may be disabled,for any number of reasons,such as registration failure.This would turn off your firewall,and your antivirus program.If you dont notice this in time,your computer will be wide open to attack.I hope norton patches this soon,good luck Stewart L.12/30/05. updated.Update 03/07/06.my registration fails every 15 days.System restore failed.I was an early adopter of this product.A bad mistake.How can symantec stay in business?.Yes the product works for some people.But for most people watch out my friends.Check all the reviews for symantec products,and you will see the truth.I see major lawsuits coming and yes symantec should have to pay its customers for ruined computers,and data losses,and more,I thank you Stewart L. 03/07/06.
