This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel.

This was not a good book, despite the positive reviews it has received. As with Erickson's other books the dialogue is painful. The dialogue is filled with "Um." "Huh." and "Uh-huh." and those fillers are used as complete thoughts and sentences. Obviously the characters have very little sucbstance if that can be the extent of each exchange. Is it so hard for two writers to come together and create a fluid sentence?? I guess so, because these 2 women are hopeless writers. This was the second book I was given by Erickson, and both books suffered from the Um and Huh problem. I cannot understand how writing like that is deemed interesting or engaging by other readers. In any case, the plot is about a woman who was once raped but cannot remember the face of her rapist. She is now a police sketch artist and is called in to assist on a case similar to her own, and it drudges up memories about her own rape. The authors did manage to keep the suspense going (not about the lead character Jane's rape) about the current case she was working on. However, there were a lot of shortcuts taken with this book. The relationship between Jane and Ray (the lead detective) was forced and very rushed at the end, leading to a unrealistic and unbelievable conclusion. The relationship Jane had with her family wasn't well developed and the character interaction was weak at best. The story could have been lengthened to explain the relationship more between Jane and her family, Jane and Ray, Jane and Alan, and even Ray and Kathleen. The authors cramed the story into just over 100 pages and left too much unsaid and undeveloped. The story was just that, a story, with no genuine substance or anything that will leave you wanting more from this/these authors. I am so glad to be done forever with Erickson books. NOT recommended.

I'm a nice girl, I admit it. Like many women it's in my nature to give more than I receive when I'm in a relationship. And I've waited for calls, e-mails, and given up my girlfriends for a last minute date with `that guy.' But, Argov shows how that nice girl approach may be undermining the ability to have a more fulfilling relationship and self-worth. This book is straight-forward and direct; Argov demonstrates why being a bit `bitchier' may pay off in the end. While the word bitch may be off-putting it is more about empowerment and leading your own life. The book had me nodding along in agreement almost the entire length. Argov doesn't site statistics for her information - just quotes from men -and while some of the quotes seemed phony, they still serve a purpose - they show you how men really do like a strong, independent woman. The book was worthwhile and will hopefully help me out in future dating situations.

Some of the editorial reviews mentioned that this book was a thriller - it wasn't, in my opinion. Have never read Woods before, but found his book to be pretty entertaining. Rick Bannon joins the elite Hollywood scene as security guard for a major studio. His position involves protecting movie stars from themselves, and we follow him through the course of some months at this job and the troubles he encounters. It was a bit like LA Confidential I guess.. very old Hollywood, and the feeling you get is the same.. old style. The only part I disliked was the ending (well, the last few chapters). The last few chapters dealt with the war, and it seemed very out of place and unnecessary.

This short story isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I only happended to buy it because of the Golden Gate Bridge on the cover. The book was very weak in plot development, character depth, scene descriptions, etc. Cassidy and Colin - the two romantic leads - could have been developed much more if the book was longer and the writing stronger. I think the publishers are just cashing in on something Roberts penned in high school - the writing is pretty bad. Save yourself the time and money and buy a more recent Roberts book.

This book makes you feel smart - by that, I mean, that when you are done reading Collapse, you feel as though you have really learned something substantial. I did notice a lot of similarity/overlap between Diamond's theories in Collapse and his previous work, Guns, Germs & Steel; many of his terms and postulations were the exact same. The book pinpoints the 5 factors that lead to an eventual collapse of a society, and also illuminates 12-13 factors that are making our own future perilous. The book has also been made into an exhibit at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles, and was a good introduction to the book. The book is just wonderful and well worth your time.

This book purchase was a HUGE mistake! It is a 2-in-1 book, and the two stories are from 1973 and 1974. They are Neanderthal romances at best - the male leads are domineering, aggressive, inconsiderate, and completely unheroic. These are not romance stories by any stretch of the imagination, and the book itself is a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The cover indicates that you might be in for a nice Christmas tale or two, but the cover was just a sales feature. The stories have nothing at all to do with Christmas and, in fact, do not even take place at Christmas-time. I think it was a horrible way to introduce readers to this author, especially if you have never read her stuff before (which I hadn't). Perhaps this author has improved her storytelling since the 70s, but based on this nonsense I wouldn't waste my time with her again. The stories were poorly written.

This was a good choice to end the Flipside series; it was a light and witty read. Two combative coworkers - Madison and Colin - need each others' help to save their company from ruin. Someone in the company is responsible for embezzling money, and Colin is the prime suspect. As he works to clear his name, he also "works" as Madison's finance, when she concocts a scheme to fool her father into believing she wants marriage and family. Obviously, the farce turns into real romance for the couple. Some of the lines are particularly witty and the story overall is much better than some in the series have been.

Fernie and his best friend are world travelers in this book of poetry. Each poem is approximately 1 page long, and is about a different world location - San Francisco, Japan, Australia, Kenya, etc. I felt that the book captured a bit of each place through the poems, and that they were humorous and fun as well. For someone with an interest in poetry, geography, travel, or humor, this book would be a great gift idea or introduction to these topics. I generally dislike reading poetry but was drawn into this book because of the cute drawings and theme of travel. It was quite a nice read, although the final page - about California geography didn't seem to fit. Recommended.

This book was enjoyable and could be read in many different ways - as the story of a flawed man, a neurotic, or even a love story. By the end I had actually come to the conclusion it was a love story of sorts - how the pursuit of love, the affection for others, and social contact in general, helped Daniel to start to overcome his issues. The story is of Daniel, a man who is troubled by his social maladies and psychological ones as well. He exists in his own world that plays out mainly in his head and every human contact or outing requires significant pre-planning. Some of his neuroticisms are quite funny (ie the Rite Aid outings) and kept the book light. It was an emotional book because at times you will be laughing at Daniel, feel sadness for him, feel sorry for him, and experience happiness too. This was a fine little read with many strong points. I missed having `chapters' in the book, but something about not having them made this read more like a stream of consciousness by Daniel more than an actual book.

This isn't a book you'll remember after it's over. The characters are forgettable and the plot is predictable. After the first book in this triology, Key of Light, there really isn't anything new to discover. We already know how this will end, so there isn't anything captivating here. The chemistry between the two characters was slightly better than the first book. This is probably one of the worst triologies N.R. has written - no sustainable plot throughout the three books, weak character leads, weak settings, and a very unbelievable storyline.

Comprehensive and informative, this is a wonderful book about the life and history of George Washington. I discovered a lot of new information throughout the book, and was impressed by the breadth of information covered. This was akin to taking an intensive college course on Washington. Many myths were debunked and this was in no way a `political book' - it was the biography/presentation of a man who shaped our American history. Even for the casual reader this would be very enjoyable. I `read' this book via audio CD (13 CDs total), and the reader was great - very easy to listen to and understand. It make my commute much more enjoyable for several weeks.

This is a historical book for teens, and is definitely a take-off of Jane Austen in many ways. The time period is the early 1800s and the young women of that era (those about 16 or 17) are already seeking husbands and becoming engaged. Nicola, an orphan, is no different. She has become engaged to one of the most eligible bachelors in town - Lord Sebastian. But, is the fair-haired Lord all he seems? The book is part mystery, a part growing-up tale, and a cutesy romance. I really enjoyed Nicola and her headstrong ways, and she was a lot of fun because she spoke her mind and did what she wanted. I loved the old-fashioned way of writing, but Cabot definitely interlaced the book with a lot of modern humor. For instance, Nicola has just completed a finishing school for women, and tries desperately to fulfill the duties of a proper lady. She is hardly ever successful, and Cabot uses almost ever social outing of Nicola's to inject humor over her lack of ladylike qualities. A really different approach from Meg Cabot and a really cute book for female readers.

I was totally impressed by this book and cannot wait for the sequel. Basically, 2 sisters - Rachel and Miri discover that their mother, and Miri (the youngest sister), are witches. As Rachel, and Miri, cope with her new `witch' status, they concoct some spells to change their lives. The spells go awry, but not without some fun first... the girls try to make their father fall back in love with their mother, give Rachel some talents and boyfriends, and create anti-acne spells. It's just a lot of fun, and the humor and wit is awesome. The writer is very funny and interjects such humor into the story that I didn't want it to end. I guess it hasn't really ended because there is a sequel upcoming. As another person said, that was disappointing... to have to wait for resolution of Rachel's love life. Recommended.

I had been waiting for over 3 years for this book to reach the USA and, needless to say I was very excited when it became available widely a few months ago. I was able to preview the book through NetLibrary and decided that it seemed good enough to purchase. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. The problem is that the author does not use his own voice and insights; the book is filled with numerous exercises (over 400!), and they give directives like "write down your greatest dream," "try to visualize something positive happening for you," and so on. The author makes a very very brief introduction to each chapter and, the chapters aren't really chapters at all. Basically, this book is a compilation of exercises that you have to do on your own. At the very end of this book the author states, "by the end of this year, you now know..." A year?? Anyone crazy enough to spend one year with this book needs some serious help. This book was purposeless, pointless, and a gigantic waste of time and money.

This was a good book, and a nice change from what I usually read - Nora Roberts. I almost gave up on this book because it started slow I thought - the reason for all the running around took a bit too long to unfold. The writing was very funny in many areas, and that was great. This was my first Justine Dare book, but I will definitely look for more.

This was my first exposure to this author, and I found the book quite realistic and entertaining. I was pretty surprised, however, by the depth of hatred the two main characters had for one another. Although they didn't insult one another too harshly, I really felt their intense dislike for one another coming through the writing. Their attraction did start to grow towards the later part of the book, but the relationship wasn't very fulfilling. I thought Ty was very uncaring and inconsiderate of Janna. Although technically a `love story,' this book was really more of a hate/love relationship between a really nice woman and a hard-ass guy.

This was a LONG LONG LONG book that didn't engage me the way I thought it would. There are 26 full CDs to listen to, and the worst part, by far, is that there is no break/pause/music to let you know when you have reached the end of a CD and need to switch to another. The Cds were extraordinarily long, and I often found myself listening to the CD almost to track 3 or 4 again before I realized - `hey, I already heard this!' It would have been helpful, especially with a book/CD set this lengthy to have the reader let you know that you need to switch CDs. The storyline was very hard to follow as well - there was an extensive cast of characters and a lot of action taking place, and it was hard to capture all of it through listening. I wasn't thrilled by this book at all, and I'm glad I opted for the CD instead of the actual book - it was a waste of time, really. The `magic, Harry Potter story for adults" was not there - it was a character driven book and not fantasy or magical by the definition of Harry Potter. The book far exceeded the length it should have been and left me with a bad opinion for this author.

I'm not sure what type of book this is - fantasy? vampire? surreal?, but it's definitely one of the worst Roberts' books ever written. Normally her trilogies are romantic and the thread is easy to identify with and follow. But this story asks a lot of the reader - you need to keep track of weird character names and the convoluted and extremely unrealistic plot. I didn't find this book or the characters interesting at all and thought it was very poorly written and planned. When I finished the book I looked at the front pages that list the other Roberts' triologies, and I found myself longing for something more like the Dream In., Chesapeake.., and Born In.. series. My recommendation is to skip this book and trilogy completely.

I read the 'Sexy' books out of order, and this was one last for me. It's a good thing I didn't read this book first, because I wasn't that drawn in by the characters or thieir story. Basically, childhood friends Katherine Bloom and Jesse Chapman discover love when he returns home. Katherine was a fun and lively character, who provided humor and heart throughout the book, but Jesse... he was a cad, a player, a loverboy, etc. I really didn't see him as a fit with Katherine, and his reformed character just wasn't believable. The book was ok, but I'd skip it in favor of the other two in this series; the books stand individually and do not need to be read in order.

This is one of the most comprehensive and useful sources I've found on this subject. It's modern, up-to-date with information, and is definitely a 'bible' for EFL teachers, or those who wish to become one. The first few chapters are introductory and provide some informaiton about various language degrees and certifications, and general information about working abroad and some of the potential problems/concerns you might have. The second part of the book -which takes up a majority of the pages - has a page or so devoted to all major countries in the world. For each country the author describes the EFL scene - whether jobs are plentiful, the amount of schools already in place, etc. and how difficult it will/won't be to get a work permit. There are also some leads for language schools in each country, with information about salasry, who to contact, requirements to work, etc. The unfortunate part about this book is that EFL comes across as a field that is non-lucrative and difficult to break into (especially if you're an American wanting to teach in the EU). Many of the country listings, when the author describes the prospects for teaching, are not encouraging at all, and have made me less interested in pursuing this line of work. The book, however, is a great resource if you're looking for EFL positions and further information.

A murder/rape suspect is on the loose and Abby does everything she can to help find the man. Once again, she teams with the Royal Oak Police Dept., although Milo is her main contact since Dutch has joined the FBI. This book has dual storylines - one focuses on Abby/Milo as they search for a rape suspect and the other storyline focuses on Abby and her connection to the mob. After she helps her friend Kendal read tarot cards at a wedding reception, Abby finds herself right in the hands of a mob hitman. The suspense in this book was actually quite good and I wondered how each of the two cases would be resolved. I found the writing style and characters very believable and fun and, all of the characters from the first book remain in this one. The part I didn't like was how strained Abby's relationship with Dutch was/became through the course of the book. Their relationship has a lot of angst and I didn't particularly like that - Dutch and Abby belong happily together! A really great book in a series that is fast becoming a fave of mine.

This is the third book in the `Crimes of Fashion' series and, in comparison to the first two - Killer Hair and Designer Knockout - was the weakest in terms of storyline and characters. Hostile Makeover puts fashion journalist Lacey Smithsonian on the trail of a killer when a supermodel, Amanda, is shot in her presence and Lacey's car is used in the getaway. This book felt more contrived and less mysterious than the other two in the series. True, these are simple mysteries to begin with, but Lacey Smithsonian was definitely dull in this story, especially in the beginning chapters. The storyline took several chapters to actually begin and, when it did, it seemed completely implausible. Lacey interviews Amanda for a fashion article and, 10 minutes into the interview, Amanda recruits Lacey to find her killer. At this point, Amanda isn't even dead and her attitude is off-putting and insincere. The other problem with this book is with the `romance' between Lacey and her sorta-boyfriend Vic Donovan. Vic has finally relocated to DC from Colorado, but is longer a cop. His job (as a cop) could actually add dimension to the mysteries Lacey encounters but for some reason the author puts Vic in the sidelines and a different career. Plus, the couple is still not `together' which is pretty unusual and ridiculous to read through. This book isn't the best in the series but is still readable.

I really wanted to like this book; it was given to me as a gift by someone who knows that I have an interest in astrology, so I read it with an open mind. First, let me say that I am an astrology hobbyist and not a professional. This book seemed more `professional' or at least attempted to be. The book itself was easy to read but, at times, hard to understand. The author assumes a lot about the readers - namely, that we understand all these astrological/natal chart terms, and secondly, that we have astrology charts handy and by our side. I think that was a HUGE mistake on the author's part - the book never mentioned that you will need to have birth charts at the ready, yet the entire book relies upon having your own birth chart ready and also that of your partner, friends, family, etc. The text is pretty useless without having the charts. I figured this book would be more for laymen, but it wasn't. I expected a fun, light read and this wasn't that type of book. I don't have much respect for this author - she infuses the text with her own personal opinions (particularly about people who dislike the study of astrology), she hypes her own credentials throughout, she constantly mentions "read my other books for more information," and she doesn't follow through with some of her own complaints. For instance, she talks about the importance of using imagery to get a better feel for astrology and how it works (ie imagine a crab (Cancer) working alongside a bull (Taurus)), and yet the book has very limited illustrations. Very unimpressed by this book. Theattempt to link psychology/astrology here fails, and there are other books out there that do a far better job of linking the two without actually attempting to. This was a big disappointment.

This was the final book from the `In the Garden' trilogy and focused on the romance between Harper and Hailey. We all knew this match was forthcoming, but it was a major disappointment; Harper and Hailey were not particularly romantic together. It seemed, at least to me, that most of the book was focused on the Harper Ghost and Hailey's daughter, Lily. Although Harper and Hailey do `get together' in this book, most of the groundwork for their romance comes from the first two books. Aside from being pretty skimpy in terms of romance, this book was flat-out unbelievable. Hailey is `inhabited' by the Harper ghost during odd moments (like while having sex), and it was just too surreal to even make it good fiction. The entire trilogy was weak and I wouldn't recommend this book. I only finished it because I had read the first two.

The book started off well enough - the introduction by Gloria's daughter Lisa Bloom was interesting to read, as was the forward by Gloria herself. I particularly enjoyed the first chapter, which recounted Gloria's childhood, parents, and decision to enter law. There were lots of new facts to be learned about her and what molded her decisionto enter women's rights law - specifically, that she was raped, had an abortion, and earned less than her male counterparts. The remaining chapters were, unfortunately, not as great as the first. I would have preferred, I suppose, an autobiography of Gloria, but the book basicallyhighlights the biggest cases from her career. There is the Amber Frey case, OJ Simpson, Hunter Tylo, etc., and the end of each chapter concludes with a snippet of "fight back and win" advice. The advice, however, is unrealistic for many of us ordinary folk - Gloria tells us how to handle the media, courtroom testimony, police investigations, etc. I was thinking - how many of us are really going to need advice on criminal court cases? If you are interested in reading about some of Gloria's more high-profile cases then the book will be interesting but, if you want to learn more about the woman herself, just read the first chapter or wait for an autobiography.

Angels Fall is a romantic suspense novel that put Nora Roberts back on my `must-read' list. For a while many of Roberts' books were very formulaic and uninteresting, but Angels Fall does a good job of being believable. Reese and Brody - the lead characters - are both deeply flawed, but the romance between them is real and heartfelt. Reece meets Brody when she relocates to a small town (Angels Fist), and quickly becomes an ace chef at the local diner. Her past is a mystery to everyone in the town and, as a newcomer, she falls under suspicion when she claims to have witnessed a murder. Brody is the only person who stands up for Reece and the two start to form a bond as they look for clues to the murder and Reece's past. The mystery was fairly decent, and the book actually had two storylines going - one about Reece's past and one about the murder she witnessed. The book was good overall and much better than some of Robert's more recent books - but I'm still wondering about the title. Angels Fist was the name of the town, and it was mentioned a bizillion times, yet the book was titled Angels Fall and that wasn't used once in the book.

This was a nice read - it wasn't a romantic book really, and didn't have too much suspense either. But, it developed the main characters well enough and had a decent plot. My interest in the book was lowered by the &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; phrase being used on pratically every other line. Carla Neggers hammered that phrase into the mind again and again and again and again - it was really irksome and kept the dialogue from flowing. I wish I had counted how many times &quot;Texas Ranger&quot; was used in the book, because it must number in the thousands - it was just overkill.

I enjoyed this CD very much, and was so glad to see a new release by Simly Red. Some of the tracks are classics they have redone, and others sample from other artists (like 'Sunrise', which is taken from Hall and Oates). The CD provides 1st class entertainment, and I love that I can listen to the entire CD without wanting to skip any tracks. IMO, there isn't a bad track on this.

There have been several Sparks books that I've enjoyed, despite the lack of character development and the often elementary grammar and storylines. I always held out hope that he would write something more `adult' with flowing sentences and a higher level of readability. Well, he certainly tried to do that with True Believer but, failed. I'm not a believer that this was a great story; the two characters are brought together haphazardly and without a foundation of friendship and respect. They spend a majority of their time tossing insults at one another and chasing `ghosts' that turn out to be absolutely nothing in the end. The premise is ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend this book. Although it's far better than some of his previous books, in terms of writing ability, the storyline now suffers and the characters just don't inspire any warmth.

This was a very impressive mystery, and I anxiously await more by this author in the Bath and Body series. Persia Rose is the main character in this book, and she is a perfume maker at her aunt's spa/beauty store called Venus Envy. In other mysteries it often seems like the characters and the eventual crime are very contrived, but this book didn't feel that way at all. The crime - the murder of Lydia Wang, a local celebrity - was very believable, and Persia wasn't involved as an amateur sleuth so much as a concerned business owner. Although she was on the trail of a killer the whole time, there was a lot more to the story than catching Lydia's murderer. We get to learn a lot about Persia and her previous life in Seattle, we meet the other characters who populate Gull Harbor, and the book envelopes you in a sense of serenity. It was fast paced and easy to read, and made me want to continue the entire time through. Another plus was that the mystery wasn't particularly easy to solve - you were guessing up until the very end.

I am so happy to have stumbled upon Barbara Bretton. Her writing, storylines, characters and settings are all very believable and absorbing. The title of this book is a bit weak and I felt it didn't really describe the book but, aside from that, it was a wonderful book. I think women of all ages would enjoy this book and its characters. The characters were rich and complex, Bretton was able to make me laugh and tear up at various points, and the story was full and highly believable. Bretton even delicately touched upon 9/11 through one of her characters and I thought it was tastefully done and very realistic. This is only my 2nd Bretton book, but I will be reading all her books from now on. Highly recommended. 5 Stars!!

Like Endgame and Enigma, this is the story of a team of covert operatives on a secret mission for the government. The book closely parallels the first two in the series and, once again, the romance and action are too similar to make any of the books notable. Endgame, Enigma, and Exposure could easily be the same book - just insert the new characters; that is how formulaic and boring the series is. I wasn't captured at all by this book and will cross Dee Davis off my list for good.

Avery suffers from a host of maladies, including bad nutrition, paranoia, and fear of her family. Because of a past incident, Avery was disowned by her family, so she spends her time making friends and lovers online. It turns out that one of Avery's online `lovers' is a man who is wanted by OPUS - an elite crime squad. In order to get more information about Avery's online lover (Andrew/Adrian), an OPUS agent named Dixon invades Avery's home and privacy for the duration of his mission. The mission takes them to the Hamptons, where they pursue Andrew/Adrian and their own budding romance. The romance is fun and engaging, the characters are interesting, and the plot maintains a steady pace and keeps you interested. As with most Elizabeth Bevarly romances, the secondary plot/romance is almost as interesting as the main romance. In this case, the subplot involves the romance between 20something "Cowboy" (Dixon's partner), and 40something Carly (Avery's sister). I enjoyed the stories very much and look forward to the next book in the series.

This book wasn't good. The reviews that offer more stars are likely die-hard Nora Roberts fans. Black Rose was `just writing' - nothing spectacular and nothing terribly romantic or involving. The main character (Roz) is prickly and hard to like, and Mitch seemed terribly weak in contrast; it wasn't a good match. Nora Roberts is definitely sacrificing good stories in order to be a prolific writer. The couple in this book (Roz and Mitch) are both almost 50, and working together in order to solve the mystery surrounding the Harper Ghost. The ghost was actually more exciting than either of the two characters this time. The `romance' between Roz and Mitch was just as you'd expect from someone as bitter as Roz... it was unremarkable and not actually romantic. This book was really weak, but the first in this series - Blue Dahlia - wasn't good either. There are far better writers out there who can weave a better story and I'm definitely more interested in discovering them than continuing to read Roberts.

This is a journal/diary, right? It has to be, otherwise the choppy sentences, awful grammar and pointless meanderings of the narrator are just bad writing. The story doesn't flow - mainly because it isn't written in prose, but as a series of diary entries that jump from one subject to the next, and from past to present. The narrator, Ruby Capote, isn't very interesting and neither are her friends. This `poker night' doesn't take place all that often in the book - generally, the entries are about Ruby and her feelings on her life in general. I didn't `feel' anything for Ruby because she didn't `feel' anything for herself - she isn't a very pro-active character and just accepts life as it comes. A non-risk taker as she points out. This was a pretty fast read, but I still feel it was wasted time.

The premise, the title, and even the cover art are all misleading - this book does not really explore the world of Internet dating beyond 3 or 4 `dates.' The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time.

This book was fulfilling - it had a great romance, strong male and female characters, and a storyline that was easy to follow, and fun. I read Big Trouble by Marianne Jameson last year and was impressed enough to read this book, and I was not disappointed. Both books provide a wonderful escape from reality, and it just so happens that the character in My Hero is a romance writer. Randi Rhodes/Miranda Lane is having some trouble writing her latest romance when who should come upon the scene ... sexy cop Chas Casey. Their meeting, and subsequent romance is fun and engaging and you really grow to like the characters. It's not great fiction, no, but this book is a nice spring fling.

I'm giving this book 4 stars because it does a good job of speaking directly to the people most likely to pick it up - adventurous travelers and thrill seekers. However, I'd give it one star for the average reader. This book is nothing more than another entry into the self-help arena. Personally, I did not identify with any of the participants' stories - swimming underwater with sharks, diving off cliffs just for fun, riding 72 roller coasters in 72 hours, etc. are not activities that the `average' person can do. The underlying message however, is that regardless of what the activity may be, you can do it if you follow the 8-steps - face your fears, rediscover your childhood, aim for the heart, etc. The book is a bunch of drivel really, and there are actually qualified psychologists and therapists with much better books to guide your inner soul if it wishes to be thrilled a bit. This book is an instance of someone hoping to capitalize on the fleeting fame of his reality program.. perhaps he should have written a travel guide instead.

This was a nice, enjoyable book. I didn't think the descriptions of Greece were as vivid as some other writers (like Frances Mayes can do for Italy), but it was quality writing and had some funny moments. I especially liked that this author wrote about a negative experience, and yet managed to not make Greece seem negative because of what happened to him. I look forward to more of Stone's books.

Before buying a subscription to this magazine I would suggest reading through an issue first, just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. No, it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking, and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read.

This was an average book - it kept me interested, but barely. I've been enjoying Neggers' books for a few months now, but this was my least favorite. The romance was barely in the book at all - the two main characters hardly even interacted and we're supposed to believe they're in love after two kisses? Yeah. Anyway, the suspense wasn't all that captivating either, and the main character (Tess) was rather cold towards her family, I thought. I think Neggers is a good writer though and would suggest starting with some of her other material first.

This was an extremely enjoyable book/mystery to read. The pace was quick, and the writing was witty and involving. As a fan of the show, I could definitely imagine each of the characters saying their lines in this book. The descriptions of settings (i.e. Hawaii and Colorado) were a bit lacking, but the characters are what drive this story and keep you reading on and on. I found the book extremely reminiscent of the television series itself, and the personalities of the characters were exact - I could completely imagine each of them voicing the dialogue from the book. The mystery itself was well-developed and was just long enough to complete the story without any unnecessary writing. Even for those who never watched the Diagnosis Murder television series, this book will be enjoyable - the writing is lighthearted, yet purposeful, and the characters are interesting and unique. I am definitely interested in reading more from this series and hope it continues for some time. I have already recommended the book to some friends who enjoy lighter problem-solving books.

I have been reading astrology books for many years now and, while many of them touch upon the darker sides of each sign, none do it with quite the same humor as this book. This book was a Cosmo recommendation, and I found that the book doesn't mince words and really &quot;tells it like it is.&quot; Some people might not agree with how their sign is represented, but then again, aren't they just expressing typical traits of their sign? Anyhow.. I read through all of the signs and their &quot;darker &quot; traits and found that the information was the same as you would find in many other astrology books, but with descriptions that are more forceful and lengthy. The book really does focus on the darker traits and says very few positive things about each sign. The writing is focused on unearthing the 'red flags' associated with each sign, and I honestly agreed with some of the negative traits of my own sign. It's not an academic book or even close.. it's a fun read and makes a great gift.

This was a good book, although definitely not for the advanced psychology student or professional. The ideas that Schwartz presents would be a great supplement to an introductory course in personality or social psychology, as it presents many of the key terms from those areas. Schwartz's main theory is that we, as a society, are presented with too many choices in our daily lives, and that more choice does not lead to a better quality of life. In fact, he argues that we should be satisfied with `good enough' and not seek to maximize our experiences all the time. The book was very general in nature and was easy to read and understand; the examples he used to illustrate his points were clear and easy to identify with as well. I didn't really learn anything new from the material presented here, but it was a great refresher on the subject and some of the main ideas of psychology in general.

These letters are a very private look into the Reagan marriage and are, at times, funny, sad, poignant, touching, and .. well, they are just loving. The letters (and narrative) are wonderful to read and give me hope that there are men out there can be expressive and emotional when in love. Some of the letters are reproduced/photocopied so you can see R.R.'s handwriting and "doodles," and it makes him even more real and accessible. The book was a joy to read and would interest anyone with a romantic side.

This was a short and sweet story about love and loss during the holiday season. The entire story takes place in the space of a week, and is pretty sappy overall. A husband and wife - who have been living together but separate for quite some time - are brought together again through their common interest in a young girl named Emily. This is a `feel-good' story with a happy ending. It won't make any great literature lists, but will make you feel good while reading it and maybe even bring a tear to your eye.

This book is super - it defines and explains the Tao and the Taoist mindset and culture, and provides practical ways to incorporate the Tao into your own life. The author is very humble as he explains his own lifestyle, and I was so relaxed and immersed in this compact book. The book itself is written in a very tranquil way and has the tendency of evoking positive thoughts and energy while you're reading it. I was unfamiliar with the Tao before reaching for this book and now have a basic understanding of what it is, the history, and the cultural aspects associated with it. I would definitely recommend this book - it is very readable and well written. 100% enjoyable.

When I received this book I was very disappointed to see the words &quot;Historical Romance&quot; in the upper jacket and I almost decided to toss it out without reading it. What a big mistake that would have been! This book, despite being labeled &quot;historical,&quot; was very modern in the word usage, references, and the boldness of the female character. Generally, the historical romances have those female characters who are virginal, sweet, unassuming, etc., but Sophia was a very believable American woman with a mind of her own. Her character was very well written and all of her actions seemed to flow naturally from what we were told about her. Despite being over 320 pages the book was a breeze to read through and kept me easily entertained. I thought the romance between Sophia and the Duke (James) could have been more passionate, but perhaps this writer is more plot oriented. There was a very good plot too (considering it is a light romance and not a drama), and the ending was very believable. This was definitely one of the more enjoyable books I have read this summer and would definitely not hesitate to recommend it.

This book is beyond funny - it is hilarious!! How can you not love a family with names like Quenton Quinton? The cover art, the title and even the premise may seem a bit discouraging, but the book is a hidden gem among short stories. Although it is just slightly less than 200 pages, the story is chock-full of action, romance, and of course, hilarity. I had read something by Kasey Michaels before and was not impressed, but this story definitely caught my attention. The setting and the vocabulary are very British and the lead characters speak with such aristocracy and pompousness that it just makes you laugh. The verbal exchanges among the characters is very subtle at times, as are the barbs and wit, but it's a first class little story. Think Scarlet Pimpernel and you kind of have an overview of the characters and how they speak. The story is a light murder mystery, but at the center of it all is Miss Quinton and her evolution from a dowdy spinster to a fashionable miss. A charming story to pass a few hours with.

Another murder case for Eve Dallas and the cast of characters Roberts has created for her "in death" books. Although the plot was set up pretty good - following a serial rapist/mutilator, I didn't really `feel' this book. The characters didn't draw me in, and the case took way too long to solve. Added to that, the police psychic that is employed (Celia) didn't have a major role in the book although her character was given a lot of depth and could have been more central to the plot. The end does have a twist, but the twist came too late in my opinion and seemed like an attempt to `tack something extra' onto the plot. Is the character of Eve always so harsh? I didn't like her very much, certainly didn't feel her childhood pain as it related to the storyline, and wondered at how she could be paired with someone like Roarke. The book was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it nor read any more in the series.

This book did have some strong points - three great female leads with a strong, developing friendship, three manly men with a lot to offer, and enough romance to keep you turning the pages. However, I really feel as though the strong points were not enough to make this a stellar read. The book is about the quest to find a key that is linked with the past, gods, demigoddesses, etc. Roberts asks a bit much of the reader to suspend reality so much and imagine people reaching through paintings, appearing in middair, living to the age of 500, etc. - the realism just wasn't there. This was definitely a supernatural story moreso than a romantic one. This is the first book in the trilogy, and the first key of three that the women have to find in order to &quot;win&quot; 1 million dollars. I think, though, that the remaining two books will be almost identical to this one, and not really high caliber writing or romance.

This book includes two stories: The Private Notebook of Katie Roberts, Age 11 and The Great Green Notebook of Katie Roberts. The setting is 1942 and Katie's father has just been killed in the war - the changes that her father's death bring are tough on Katie, and her readjustment to a new state, a new school, and new friends is poignant. Katie's religion also plays a role in the book - as a Jewish girl in a mostly Catholic area she struggles to fit in. Her religious background actually serves as a nice introduction to cultural differences. The text is aimed at preteen girls and the layout is hip and modern - within the `notebook,` the author includes drawings, letters, photographs, and a variety of other scribbles that draw attention to Katie's feelings. The notebooks follow Katie through ages 11 and 12, and we learn about her and her family, her best girlfriends and, of course, the guys she is interested in. While the Depression and post-war setting works nicely for the story, some readers may find it old-fashioned and hard to identify with. However, between the pages of this notebook is a lively preteen girl facing issues most girls can identify with. Recommended.

This was another entry into the &quot;oh my God I'm 20/30something and not married yet&quot; genre that seems to be everywhere these days. The reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the writing; it was quite disturbing to me that the author used parentheses in such abundance. Every single page, every single line has (words inserted like this), and it really detracted from the flow of the words. I wish I was joking, but the parenthesis are everywhere!!! The other drawback -- the writing was very choppy. The. Author. Wrote. Like. This., and all it really evidenced was that this was a young author who isn't striving for great literature. I've read a lot of the British authors and the Bridget Jones types stories, so it was refreshing to read this humorous look at marriage and dating by an American writer. The book is light, funny, and easy to read through in a few days. It was generally interesting, had some cutesy twists in the plot, provided a lot of interesting background about wedding planning, and there was enough chemistry between the characters to make it romantic.

If you love Michael McDonald, you'll love this CD! These are definitely some of his greatest hits as a solo artist, duet performer, and while with Doobie Brothers. There are 19 tracks, and the first 13 are especially groovy and distinctive; the last few weren't as well known (at least to me). The liner notes aren't extensive but do provide a bit of insight into each song and why it was written, which is cool. I am very pleased with this purchase and have been happily listening for days. Obviously there are many more hits that could have been included, but these are a nice compilation and just another way to support such a distinctive voice. And his blue eyes on the front cover... that should be enough to buy it right there!

This book is charming. The author uses Jane Austen's more famous works - Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, etc. to demonstrate good/bad relationship behavior. There are 10 tips, each presented in lengthy chapters, that show how to model your relationship behaviors based on the romantic couples in Austen's books. The book was actually quite enlightening - although the 10 dating 'tips' are pretty obvious, the way in which the author uses examples from Austen's works is what makes the book a joy to read. Aside from examples from the books, the chapters also include examples of real-life couples and situations. This is quite an inspiring book, especially because you can see how well educated the author is about her subject matter (Austen, not dating), and it was interesting to see Austen's books critically examined from a romantic standpoint, while still being very fun.

This is a very cute book, and actually does successfully illuminate points about the signs that you might not otherwise know. Additionally, the author includes Moon, Venus and Mars charts in the back, so you can quickly and easily locate what sign someone falls under. The delivery is very tongue-in-cheek and has a certain crassness to it; this isn't a book that sets out to impress more literary types. However, it does what it sets out to do - enlighten you to the love aspects of the signs. I would recommend this book with one MAJOR CAVEAT: this book is very repetitive of Born on a Rotten Day. I found that much of the information overlapped, and that this book was not a compliment for the first title. If you already own Born on a Rotten Day you won't be overly impressed by this new title and won't find anything new in it.

This book wasn't about a single character, but was a family ensemble that included a unique mix of characters. Although there really is no `main' character, the story is mostly about Constance, and she introduces us to her close and extended family when she travels to Europe for her father's memorial. The extended family is comprised of sisters, boyfriends and girlfriends, neighbors, ex-wives, and even a political leader. The reason the family/friends have all gathered is for the memorial, and in the weeks leading to this we are afforded a glimpse into their lives. Their lives are messy and complicated, to say the least- it creates tension and conflict within the summer house they are all staying at. As it turns out, the dead father also led a rather messy and complicated life, and his misdeeds continue to come to light even after his death. There was a lot of bickering (I felt) between the characters and I was disappointed with how slow the book was - it just never involved me overly much. There was also a point in the last of the book where a new character (Jojo) was introduced and the father's past was revealed - the action and about 6 chapters in the later half just didn't seem to gel with the rest of the story. I would marginally recommend this book - it's not a romance or even a `happy' book, but is about family drama.

I really wanted to like this book - the title is fun, the cover is fun, the premise is fun, and Macalister's most recent book, Men in Kilts, was awesome. But.. this was not a quality book. The main character (Alix) is an annoying female that is just as self-centered and obnoxious as her friends say she is. The lead male (Alex) is just not believable. In fact, the entire romance lacks realism and is hardly more than teen fluff. I felt like this book was very immature and seemed geared to a very low age group - like teens. It just wasn't well written and I wouldn't recommend it.

I read The Care and Feeding of Husbands a few years ago and found this book to be remarkably similar. I would say that if you have already read Husbands, you can safely skip this book. The basic theme is the same: treat your man like royalty and you will be richly rewarded. Well... that is fine and dandy if a majority of the population shared these traditional values and male/female roles, but I don`t think people do. The advice here isn't suitable for modern women (and I don't mean feminists); it boils down to servitude to the man. I read this book (and her previous one) so I have an all-around view of what others think - not because I believe in what she is saying. There are a lot of examples throughout the book to help couples deal with various problems - sex, money, kids, nagging, etc. The book is definitely traditional and provides an interesting look at what your marriage could be like if you put some of Dr. Laura's ideas into practice. The book is simple, easy to read, and short. I've never heard her radio program, but I'm pretty sure the `advice' in this book can be had for free by listening to her on-air.

This book wasn't as gruesome and vivid as I'd been led to believe, but it was certainly not typical of NR, and was much better suited to J.D. Robb. The romance between Catarina (Reena) Hale and Bowen (Bo) Goodnight didn't begin until halfway through the book, and although Bo was a great leading man - very funny and charming - he was secondary to Catarina. Their relationship was very similar to Eve/Roarke from the "In Death" books; Catarina was, without a doubt, the lead character, and Bowen (Bo) was a minor player in her life. Catarina is an arson investigator in the book and the subject matter (fire/arson) was an uninteresting topic, at least to me. Instead of pursuing a single character throughout the book, the chapters jump around from fire to fire and follow Catarina on-the-job instead of on the trail of a single individual. It just wasn't interesting. The ending was particularly violent and I felt cheated by the lack of romance and the hasty way in which the couple finally ended up together. Aside from all of this, the worst part of the book, by far, is the writing. The sentences are very choppy and abrupt, and characters don't complete full thoughts, statements, or sentences; it's extremely annoying to read sentence after sentence without a verb or proper sentence structure. Thumbs down on this losing book.

This was the first time I had read this author and this book was quite enjoyable. The story is basically about the romance between an American writer and a Scottish sheep farmer. The romance was very 'adult' in comparison to the countless other fluffy romances on the market, and the writing was very witty overall. I found myself laughing at loud several times, and I really enjoyed the description of the characters and the place itself (the Scottish Highlands is where it's set). I think the thoughtful descriptions of Scotland and the lifestyle of the main character (Ian) made the book really come to life for me. While there isn't a major plot here - just following the developing relationship of the characters - there was a lot of great interaction between the families. The family dynamics and adjustment of the two characters made for some very fun moments and I think the author did a great job of making her hero/heroine very realistic and easy to identify with. The only drawback was with some of the e-mail correspondence that was splattered throughout the book. Supposedly the main character, Kathie, has a best friend, Cait, that she corresponds with through e-mail. The e-mails didn't add anything to the story and in fact, detracted from it in some cases. This book will definitely have you contemplating a trip to Scotland and hoping for a Scotsman yourself! Overall, it's a definite thumbs up and highly recommended!

Despite not being her best, this was still an engaging story. I have read almost every Nora Roberts book available, and this seems, so far, to be the weakest start to a trilogy. The connection between the 3 main women isn't very strong (co-workers, and not always amiable ones at that), and the `thread' that holds them together isn't very viable. The thread is the Harper Ghost that haunts the home they all live in, and the 3 women (and their 3 leading men) all set about to uncover the story behind this singing ghost. It just didn't work for me. Neither did the romance between Stella and Logan; in fact, their interactions were rather brittle and distant. I just didn't feel the energy between them, and Logan wasn't a very romantic/manly lead. Since these paperback trilogies are considered to be Roberts' true romances I was definitely hoping the characters would have been that way. However, there is still hope for the next story, Harper and Haley - they seem like a more likely love match and perhaps will make for a better story.

This short, romantic story packs quite a punch. When Ethan arrives in the small town of Endicott, Indiana, he brings with him a cloud of suspicion that Angie Ellison cannot wait to uncover. As the town reporter, she sets about to discover why Ethan has come to town and what he wants with her fathers' company. Ethan is a murderous mob/mafia man, or is he? Angie and Ethan grow closer as the book continues on, and Angie begins to see Ethan for what he really is - a decent guy who may just be on her side. The romance is very fun and engaging and the characters are smart and interesting. Sure, this isn't great literature, but it provided me with a ton of laughs with its witty lines, and an afternoon of entertainment.

FYI - Patricia Cabot is the pen name of Meg Cabot, the insanely popular writer of the Princess Diaries and the Princess in .. series, among others. She's always been talented, long before she was mainstream, and Educating Caroline proves that readily. This is just about the best "historical" romance I've ever come across. Although it's technically historical (set in the late 1800s), the main characters are extremely modern and witty. The dialogue is sharp and the characters are well-developed and exciting. The heroine (Caroline) isn't a shy wallflower, but a woman with a strong mind and opinions. The plot develops when Caroline, engaged to a marquis, seeks assistance (of a romantic nature) from a more `seasoned' man named Braden. Braden is a Don Juan with a big reputation, but he has a soft spot for Caroline and they have wonderful chemistry. I couldn't stop reading this book, literally. Despite being about 420 pages it goes fast and you really won't want it to end. Definitely read it!

On the positive side - this book was a quick read, the characters were interesting, and the writing was witty and fun. The main character, Georgie, finds herself in a love triangle when her ex-boyfriend, David, comes back into her life and threatens her relationship with her current beau, Mike. Mike is an extremely likeable character - he's employed!, fun, sexy, confident, and has an air of mystery about him that is quite intriguing, and it is Mike that actually propels the later half of the book. Unfortunately, Georgie is a very flawed character, and was insufferable at times - she has a wonderful relationship with Mike, and yet turns back to David for no reason whatsoever; I was disappointed with Georgie in many instances, because it seemed that she just wasn't smart -but, I must admit that she stayed stupid the entire book, so at least she was in character! However, the most misleading and disappointing part of When in Rome is that very little of the story actually takes place in Rome - in fact, it's only about 1 chapter (or 5-7 pages) that are spent in Rome - the title really made me believe the book would be set in Rome for more than just a few pages. I'd recommend the book, because even with its negative points it was still fun and easy.

This is a pretty long autobiography, but Queen Noor has led a pretty interesting life so it makes sense. The story is not simply about her and King Hussein, but her role as a Queen and what she was able to accomplish during her time in Jordan. Although she talks about her husband very lovingly, I didn't `feel' the romance in this story. It wasn't a fairy tale to me - it seemed more as though she was subservient to her husband and that she basically did as she was told. I don't think it was a great as we are led to believe by the media. Thankfully, the focus is mostly on the Middle East region and its struggles. The book was a good way to learn about the region and was a pretty interesting read.

This is a very moving book that tells the story of a young girl and her aging dog. As she reminiscences about her dog and how he used to be, an adult will get the sense of impending doom but children may not see the dog's death coming. The book is quite positive at the outset, describing how the dog is aging but used to enjoy games, running, jumping, etc. The death comes rather fast and yes, in a blunt way, but it's touching and makes me cry every time I start reading it. It's a wonderful book for children who have an older pet and those who have recently lost one; it tells the story of love between humans and animals, the joys they bring us, and the happiness that can be found with a new pet and new bond as well. It's realistic and you can't shield children from life. This book deals with a sad subject in an open manner and makes you feel something too. I'd highly recommend it because, in addition to poignant writing the illustrations are beautiful.

Mr. and Mrs. Watson are the proud owners of Mercy, their pampered pig, in this adorable chapter book. In this first adventure, Mercy climbs into bed with the Watsons' one night and they soon find themselves in distress when the bed collapses under their combined weight. It's Mercy to the rescue (sort of) when a trip to the neighbors house results in a call to the fire department and the rescue of Mr. and Mrs. Watson from their collapsing bed. Mercy is treated as a hero and given his favorite dish of all - hot buttered toast! The story is fun and active, but the best part of this book isn't the writing - it's the illustrations. The cartoon-like drawings are fun, retro, and extremely vibrant, and perfectly capture Mercy in his adventures. The illustrations add everything to this book and the thoughtful details in the drawings made it a very fun read. Recommended!

The writing is good - that much cannot be denied. But, the plot is identical to that of The Devil Wears Prada. The only difference? This is set in a publishing company and not a fashion company. A unique plot would have made the book stronger.

This book is nothing more than a listing of places that we all already know about and know we should see. Nothing here is really 'off the beaten track' - this is just a large compilation of already famous places. You already know you need to visit the places listed in this book (ie South Beach, Leeds in London, San Francisco/Napa).

I gave this book a 4 star rating mainly because it was funny. The book actually contains three complete stories (and they are each about 150 pages each). The three stories are all about manly cowboys living in the midwest and are called &quot;Manhunting in Montana,&quot; &quot;Bachelor Father,&quot; and &quot;Pure Temptation.&quot; The first story invloves a photographer who heads out to Montana to shoot a beefcake calendar. She ends up falling for the rancher who owns the place she visits and fun and frolick ensues. Pure Tempatation is a story of childhood friends that take friendship to the next level. I enjoyed the quick wit in both of these stories and found they ended much too soon. The only sleeper in the book is Bachelor Father - it's about a baby that results from a one night stand; I thought the chemistry in the story was really fake and the story was just really droopy. All in all it's a fun read and worth the time if you can find it.

Not a Michael Bolton fan, but a real fan of this album. I heard "Dance With Me" on a station and was like "that's a great Latin tune" The tune stuck with me and I found out later it was Bolton from this CD. I was shocked to know it was a Bolton song. I'm happy to say that Dance With Me isn't the only great tune on this CD - "I Want to Hear You Say It" is also very strong. A lot of people used to ridicule Bolton's music as too pop, but this CD is really mature and easy to listen to and like, even for a non-fan.

This book was NOT HOT. The storyline was weak, the characters were weak, and the "love" between the two main characters was not believable. The story revolves round a divorced couple who both end up on the same cruise in the same cabin. There was huge potential here - to bring to life the ports of call and the setting, to fully describe the boat and the atmosphere, to make the characters romantic, etc. however this book doesn't take advantage of anything. The two main characters are childish and not very well spoken, the people they meet on the cruise are not fully developed or interesting, and the "sex" scenes are not hot and not very romantic either. It was not well-written and not well-developed. The book was halfway interesting up until about the mark, and after that it just fell very flat and was a complete struggle to get through. I do not recommend this book at all.

My previous experience with a Justine Dare book (High Stakes) is what drew me to this newest book. However, I was quite disappointed by the plot and the characters. The book is described as &quot;contemporary romance,&quot; but the feeling between the two characters isn't especially strong, and the romance is minimal. There was a subplot between two divorced detectives that was actually more interesting than the main characters. The &quot;mystery&quot; was ... well, easy to figure out after reading the first chapter, so the book ended up being not as suspenseful as I had hoped. From reading two of Dare's books, I would say that her strength is as a mystery writer moreso than romance. I just wish the identity of the Avenger wasn't so easy to figure out, and that the two main characters - Alex and Regan - had spent more time getting to know one another. This wasn't a poorly written book, or even an uninvolving one, it was just pretty simple and made for time-wasting.

This book was very fast-paced, sexy, and fun. The book is a romance, and the main characters are well-rounded and interesting. Mia Appleby is a tough as nails woman with a shameful past, and Kevin McKnight is her sexy neighbor - a man who teachers troubled youth during the day and rides his motorbike at night. In a romantic twist, the female (Mia) is the one who is reluctant to love; while Kevin wears his heart on his sleeve for Mia, she remains dispassionate towards him - despite enjoying his body nightly. The chemistry between the Mia and Kevin is HOT and even the introduction of a teenager into their lives doesn't dampen their love life. This book will make you a happy reader for a few hours.

I'd never heard of Bruce Cameron before, but the title and the cover made me want to read this book. Some of the reviewers have compared him to Dave Barry.. but I don't think he's as talented or as funny. This book wasn't purposeful so much as it was just a lighthearted look at men and how they are. Some of the chapters were funnier than others... but overall I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expercting a 'serious' book, but even so this didn't live up to expectation. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are independent of one another so you can skip around and read just the ones that interest you most.

I have a Canon IP3000 and had no problems using this paper. Unlike many reviewers, I am very satisfied with the quality and even the size. The size is 4x6.5, but it's a benefit really, because you don't end up touching the photo when it has finished printing. Instead of smudging the ink or leaving a fingerprint on the photo that extra room along the side or bottom helps... and can easily be cut away later. My pictures look as perfect as they did on the days they were taken and to me, that is satisfying enough to earn it 5 stars.

I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. Basically, a big-city cop (Nate) relocates to a small town in Alaska and becomes the chief of police for this town, aptly named Lunacy. Shortly into his reign the town succumbs to murder and mayhem and the storyline becomes more mysterious as doubt is cast upon several lead characters. The female lead, Meg, is rather harsh and I didn't really like her character all that much - she wasn't likeable in any way and I often thought 'Nate is way too good for her'. Overall, Meg was the biggest drawback in the book for me, as was the murder itself. Although the murder is described very well, especially the life/background of the man killed, we never really understand why this person was killed. Also, Roberts incorporates some journal entries of the deceased into the pages but she never explains the journal in-depth either.. some loose ends I would say... including Charlene and her romance with John.. what happened ther?? The story was involving though, although light on the romance and a little heavy on the mystery and scenic descriptions. I got the impression a few times like it was a scene from that TV series Northern Exposure.. several scenes and characters mimicked that.

This was a wonderful story. It was part romance, part drama, part religious, and all heart. The characters were well-rounded and interesting, and the dilemmas that Grace had to face were realistic and heartwarming. I was completely drawn in by the characters in the book and the relationships between the family members. The book (I think) is classifiedas Christian literature, or at least turns out to be, especially in the last third of the book. I was a bit disappointed by the ending and how neatly Michael's situation was solved - if only everything were that easy! I felt that the ending would have been more honest if Michael had died and then Grace found herself through religion. But anyway... the book was still wonderful and very touching. I liked that the book was Christian in nature and yet the lead character(s) were very sexual with one another and interested in things that the church did not condone - to me that made it a very realistic book and a realistic portrayal of conflicts in life.

This was a fun and fast read. I laughed out loud a few times and enjoyed the fun and lively character of Seonaid. Despite some cute love scenes there really wasn't a connection between Seonaid and her intended (Blake); he was mainly a foil for her jokes and wanderings. Basically, Seonaid and Blake have been engaged in an arranged way for years and he has finally decided to come claim his bride. Seonaid tries desperately to escape Blake, and a lot of chasing and adventures happen along the way to marital bliss. The book was written in Scottish dialogue and was a bit hard to understand at first, but once you adjust to the writer it's all good. I would recommended the book for light reading and entertainment.

I would consider this a classic Sansone DVD in the sense that she uses all of the same moves that she normally does for her walking workouts: side steps, knee lifts, kicks. It's a five star though, because she really gives you a good workout, with a solid warm-up, workout, and then cool down period. I have a majority of her recent DVDs and would rank this as a favorite, because it is more intermediate than some of the others, and has a countdown clock, which I enjoy looking at. The entire workout, from start to finish, is about 45 minutes and covers 3 miles. You can't select chapters, so you pretty much have to stick with the entire routine. The music is a bit ho-hum, but the set is 'fresh' and doesn't look the same as from her previous videos. Also, Leslie is alone the whole time, with no workout partners. She talks way too much, and if there is one thing I wish they'd include on her DVDs it'd be the option for music only so you don't have to hear her. I seem to select this DVD quite a lot, and think it's one of her better newer releases.

There is something very childish about this book - it might be that the main female character (Celeste) is opening a petting zoo and talks to the animals on her farm as though she was Dr. Doolittle. Or, it may be that the storyline itself is just not adult enough. There was romance, but not with the lightness and fun that romance should bring. This romance was fraught with difficulties and emotions and laughter that only came at the expense of the female character. The characters were not drawn very well, in my opinion. Celeste is portrayed as a dumb, busty blonde - despite claims to the contrary, and the male lead (Rand) is a typical cowboy who holds all his feelings inside and walks about with an emotional grudge on his shoulder. The basic plot is that Celeste moves next door to Rand and spoils his attempts to expand his proprty when she announces her plans to open a petting zoo. Hello - this is the 21st century - a petting zoo is a stupid idea for the plot of a modern book! Anyway, the whole book is pretty silly - following Celeste in her attempts to get this petting zoo off the ground. The best part of the book was actually the subplot involving Sara and George, a couple that was torn apart 28 years before and are finding love again. Overall, this wasn't a good book and I won't read anything more by this author - there are far better stories out there!

I'm a definite fan of this series but think, so far, this is the weakest book of them all. It's partially because Abby and Dutch are both meandering about with nothing to do for an entire month - Abby is on vacation and Dutch has been shot. Their boredom at home somehow made the story boring too. Abby plays nursemaid to Dutch (in his home) and she suffers her own nicks and scrapes while dealing with a new home she has purchased. There is a spirit of some sort haunting the home Abby bought and she spends the length of the novel doing historical research about the home. The book was so-so; the plot wasn't great, but it did move along the story of Abby and Dutch quite a lot. Because she was living with him there were a lot of twists and turns in their relationship. The same cast of characters from the other books appear - including the cute Eggy - and they are all pleasing. I was hoping for more action in this book - perhaps in the next one?

The Notebook was a wonderfully romantic book, but this - The Wedding - is uninvolving and repetitive. This is supposed to be a contiunation of The Notebook and follows the story of Jane and Wilson; Jane is the daughter of Noah and Allie from The Notebook. Wilson and Jane have drifted apart from one another during the course of thier 30 year marriage, and this is Wilson's story of how he gains redemption for his misdeeds all those years. The characters are flat, the dialogue is repetitive, and I felt like I was reading the same chapter from beginning to end. Every chapter is almost identical to the one before it (in terms of words and descriptions), and I found this book to be boring and badly written. There is no depth here, and the writing is as if someone is speaking to you all the time. For instance, &quot;I got up. I went out. I went to the store. I felt happy. Then I did this...&quot; It is pretty childish writing and a very flat story.

i use this often between colorings, to cover up grey hair along my temples and right down the center of my part. it has a dual side to it - one side is a mascara brush and the other side is a tip, which is supposed to be more precise. i find that the mascara brush works the best, although it does tend to distribute out and use a lot of the product. but you can switch the brushes around so you can use both sides of the product equally. the product is ok - it does cover the grays until you wash your hair again, but it's also messy, because if you put your hands near your hair after this is applied you'll come away with brown or black residue on your hands. the mascara brush also seems to pull out hair so i end up with long hair wrapping around the brush. i generally apply the product and then use a hair coloring towel or paper towel to wipe away excess from my hair itself. the color is also really dark - the dark brown may as well be black. i will continue to use this type of product because i feel better without grey, but i will try switching to a lighter shade to match lighter hair color. i have also used the lipstick applicator that this company makes, and this mascara/tip brush is far better.

I am 100% impressed by the quality of the material in this book. Basically, this is a coming-of-age story that follows Brian Jackson on his way to university. He is away from home and his childhood friends for the first time, and his life experiences are what make this book so wonderful. Through the use of humor and the right amount of emotion the author gives us a look at a year in the life of Brian and how he handles various situations. Even as a female I could identify with many of Brian's issues and found most of them laughable because they are just so human. This book reminded me a lot of Catcher in the Rye, and is definitely worthy of the comparison. The story captures you from beginning to end, and is just spot-on. I didn't realize the book and author were British, but all of the British humor and terms made it all the more fun for me to read. This is the type of book and the type of characters that will stay with you long after you finish the book. I wasn't sure how it would end, but I was so happy with the ending - I thought it was completely satisfying and the humor and compassion you feel for the character of Brian stays with you until the very last sentence. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I was stunned to see just how small these earrings were/are when I opened the box. I have a very small set of earrings and these were even smaller - they are sized for a newborn who just got their ears pierced for the first time, definitely not for an adult. No way. If you're a larger woman in height or weight these would just look ridiculous on you. On the positive side the clasp was very stong and the earring had a bit of thicknes to it. But really, a joke in terms of size, especially for the listed price. I would expect to find these in a discount retailer for about half of what they are on amazon. They might be gold, but know what you're buying in terms of size before you get these. Very very very small. Smaller than a dime.

This guide was slightly outdated, and I found that many of the prices and admission times had changed. I would say to be cautious of the copyright date for this book and either wait for a new one, or call ahead to confirm entry fees/prices before you visit Boston. As with all DK books the pictures are stunning in this guide. I happened to see many tourists using this book while I was there, and especially helpful are the street maps that are included, and the subway map too. I must say that I didn't agree with their Top 10 list - there were many other things of interest that could have/should have been a Top 10. For instance, the JFK Library/Museum was given less than 1 paragraph write-up in the book and should have made the Top 10. The book should have mentioned a few other things as well - namely that there are very few tour companies/trolley companies in Boston so you are, mainly, on your own when it comes to touring. There are very few chain restaurants and stores in the downtown area - mostly upscale shops and eateries. There are limited souvenir shops downtown, unless you consider sports items souvenirs. And, the part of the book that I felt was the worst disservice was their recommendation to go in September/October. The guide says that late Sept/early Oct. is the best time to see Boston, but... my trip was a wash-out for 2 of the 3 days I was there. Perhaps this was just a one time bad weather system? I'm not sure, but with such cold temperatures and high winds I definitely wouldn't recommend Sept/Oct as great visiting times.

The best part about this book (and really, any of the books by Elizabeth Bevarly) is the humor that is injected into the story. The writing goes beyond witty - it's downright funny. And yet, the characters still manage to be well-rounded, entertaining, and very romantic. In this story, Becca and Turner - best friends since 1st grade - decide to quit smoking, and they go to see a hypnotherapist who can help them. The hypnotherpist mistakes Becca and Turner for another couple and hypnotizes them to respond to sexual cues instead. What follows is quite hilarious, and takes Becca and Turner's friendship to an entirely new level. Turner is very manly and quite a catch, and Becca is a great companion for him. The story has a very happy ending and is just romantic comedy at its best. Highly recommended.

My first thought when I saw this book was, " what a stupid book -who needs a book about how to operate a pedometer." My curiosity about what the book might entail made me open the first few pages and read a bit. I was pleasantly surprised by the words on the page. This is definitely a good book for people who are at or below the basic level of fitness and want to get started doing something to improve their health.There is really nothing simpler than putting on a pedometer and letting it count your steps, and the book doesn't explain pedometers as much as the concept of walking your way to fitness with the aid of a pedometer. There is a nice list of resources at the back of the book, as well as some suggestions about what pedometer to purchase. There are a few more than 6 chapters but, basically, this is a 6-week program that is designed to increase your steps per day up to 10,000. The author shows you creative ways to achieve your step goal (although not all of them are practical, especially if you live in a large, sprawling city or an inner city neighborhood with limited walking spaces). Overall, I enjoyed the book and found it easy to read and very informative. The book is primarily for beginners/those not interested in high-impact activities and will get you interested enough to try and walk your way to health.

This is the conclusion in the Darcy trilogy, and it was definitely the best one yet. Is that because of the writing or because it culminates in the happily ever after? I think it's a bit of both. Aidan's Darcy is far more romantic than in the original book, and part of his appeal (to me anyway) was always his aloofness and enigmatic character. Anyway, Aidan does a really wonderful job of filling us in on Darcy's life outside of his interactions with Elizabeth; we see how he went about hunting down and dealing with Wickham, how he makes right the situation with Charles Bingley, and his further interaction with Lady Catherine. This book contains what I think is the most pivotal scene in the story-Elizabeth's rejection of Darcy's proposal. This is the catalyst for the change in his character, and by the end of this book we definitely have a different man. The end was a bit .. syrupy.. for my taste, but overall it was a wonderful read and by far the best set of books to complete the P&P story.

The writing is solid and the romance between Claudia and Ben was touching and believable. However, this book is not nearly as well-written and involving as Something Borrowed/Blue. The problem I had with this book was mainly the ending. You know by about halfway through the book how the ending will go and it spoils the entire read. I felt that the author sacrificed Claudia's character for a happy ending. The issue of to have/not have a baby is pretty insurmountable, especially given how anti-baby Claudia is, so the end just not believable.

Quite simply, I LOVED THIS BOOK! I finished it in a day because I just couldn't stop reading about Jane and her life. At the outset of the book, Jane is a hard-nosed attorney who wants things done her way, on her schedule, and without errors. In the courtroom, with co-workers, and even on dates her personality is very hard and militant and, instead of attracting men and getting to second dates, Jane finds herself perpetually single. Why? Well, despite being the best attorney in NYC, Jane doesn't realize that she is lacking some of the fundamental qualities that men are seeking in a partner (ie femininity). When Jane finally realizes what she lacks, she makes up for it big-time by morphing into someone else (Doris Day) and leading a completly new life. The transformation into Doris Day was laugh out loud funny - downright hysterical in many places, especially when she shows up at work and family functions as her new self. Aside from a solid storyline and a great leading character, there were a host of well-defined supporting characters in this book and they were all at turns funny, engaging, and evil! The author is also quite original with the writing; The Thing About Jane Spring is written entirely in the third person. At first, it was offputting but, after a few chapters I realized that reading the book was like watching a Doris Day film - because Jane wasn`t narrating, we could see her life for what it really was. I was drawn into the book as though it was a mini-movie, and it definitely had that `old-school' charm about it. It was also quite romantic - particularly towards the end! A highly recommended book!

If you enjoy characters with no ambition, pity-me attitudes, and a cast of supporting characters with little depth and interest then this book is for you. Personally, I found Jody - the main character - a real loser.. she was un-ambitious, living in a small town yet doing nothing active to change her circumstances, and seemed to enjoy pity-me parties. There were a few interesting moments, but those generally involved characters other than Jody; for instance, her roommate, Erin, has a boyfriend who likes to play Batman during sex.. those scenes were funny. Overall, the book wasn't humorous and the ending was not believable, at all. Also unbelievable was Jody's interest in buying a home; we are told she is a poor, lowly waitress, so where does she even have cash for this hilltop home she keeps yearning for? A lot of this book just didn't gel.

The book is oversized and each purse description is accompanied by a full-page glossy photo. In fact, all of the pages are high gloss and are great for illustrating the finer details of each purse. Almost all of the purses are cigar-box style and very few are made from fabrics. In fact, this book was perfect for a non-sewer because none of the purses require sewing! The purses are perfect for someone who is crafty and imaginative but cannot sew. The purse designs are very inspiring, and are made by using a variety of paints, collages, decopauge, stickers, stamps, photos, handles and hardware. The pictures and accessory ideas really help to get your creative juices flowing. The description of how to make each purse was pretty good as well (though they could have been more specific and detailed). I found the book to be quite helpful and plan to refer to it often - mostly for inspiration and item placement ideas.

I am a huge Elizabeth Bevarly fan, but this was not her usual fare. This story was missing the humor and wit that is evident in every one of her stories. But, this was her very first book - something I didn't realize when I purchased it. A businessman, Silas, finds himself on a remote island in the Caribbean after his plane goes down. He meets (and within like 4 days) falls in love with Hester, a woman who also escaped the city life for an island lifestyle. The `romance' is superficial and uninteresting, and the characters - both the primary and secondary ones - are undeveloped. The book is bad. I would recommend sticking to modern Elizabeth Bevarly stories and staying out of her archives!

Waste of time. Waste of money. This book is a compilation of tips for the single traveler, but does little more than spew common sense and websites at you. It's ridiculously simple and unnecessary. I can't imagine that anyone who has ever traveled (alone or with a group) would need this book.

There are 390 pages in this book and the main couple only gets 'romantic' on page 345. I hardly call that a romance, yet that is how this book is classified - as "contemporary romance." This book is very far from being contemporary, and I'm not really sure it's all that appealing to women in the younger set (a.k.a. 20s and 30s). This book reads as though my grandmother was telling it to me - it's a grandma romance. One of the main romantic characters in the book is a curmudgenly old guy age 87. Not romantic, not sexy, not something very appealing to read about. The characters are sedate, the action is slim to none, the characters are boring, the plot is weak, and the writing is drab and just... oldish. This book has no staying power - it doesn't involve you or make you want to remember the characters afterwards. I wouldn't recommend this book or any others by Woods, especially if you're a younger woman. The book doesn't capture the spirit of romance at all.

I gave this four stars because the `jacket' adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product. What was once a slim, sleek product is now a rather large, rubberized item. On the plus side, this jacket definitely protects the MP3; it is very solid, and covers the item completely and securely. They included a belt clip, and a screen cover that is very hard and will not be easily scratched. The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now. I wish there were other color choices, but over all I'm very pleased with the product. Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen, but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go. Highly recommended product.

The book is divided into two distinct parts - the first is the Nora Robert romance part and the second part is the J.D. Robb portion . My expectation was completely different from what the book actually offered. I `thought' that the book would seamlessly blend the Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb elements within the same story and not separate them so distinctly. Basically, this is like 2 books bound together as one - they are really individual of one another and connect with a very thin string. It would have been much more interesting, and more complicated (obviously something Roberts is not capable of) to actually write a story that blended instead of keeping each part so distinct. The second part was boring and unnecessary - the first part was a nice romance, even though the characters did rush it quite a bit!

This book was delightful - fast-paced, interesting, laugh out loud funny, and romantic, too. Basically, Samantha Sweeting is a high-powered attorney who is up for promotion to partner at her firm. But, when she makes a careless error, she finds herself an outcast at her firm, with friends, and even with her mother. But, her life begins anew when she is mistaken for a housekeeper in another town, and her once frenetic life as a lawyer is forgotten, as she learns to complete simple domestic chores for her employers. The plot is completely ridiculous - I cannot even fathom a person as smart as Samantha agreeing to scrub toilets and like it, but the story makes for a nice read and contains some really funny scenes (mostly in the kitchen, where most of Samantha's mishaps occur). Lucky for Samantha, her employers also have a beefcake gardener on staff (Nathaniel), and he serves as her romantic interest and caretaker. The story was fun, although the last 3 or 4 chapters were rather offputting, because they were so hectic and ill-conceived. It seemed as though the author didn't have a nice way to end the story and everything was jumbled together hastily. Overall, it was worth reading and I'd recommend it!

This book was excellent. I started by reading my own star sign to see if I felt the information was accurate or just nonsense. Surprisingly, the information presented about my star sign (and all the others) is insightful, meaningful, and purposeful. As the other reviewer stated, many astrology books focus on the negative (or even the positive) aspects of a sign, but do not really show you how to do anything with the information. But, MacKinnon does; this really is like having a coach on-hand. Through exercises designed to increase your awareness of your own goals, values, etc., she not only addresses the positives and negatives of each sign, but offers practical solutions for helping yourself get through trouble points. She devotes a generous 12-15 pages per sign (sometimes more) and the information is really valuable, whether you are interested in astrology or not. Most of the exercises (and there are about 5 per sign, so 60ish total) can be done by anyone, not just those born under the star sign the exercise falls under. This is definitely a book I'm going to keep on my shelf and I'd 100% recommend it.

This book would be great for both high schoolers and college students alike. It also has usefulness to adults looking to change career fields and discover what occupations are within each broader category. The book is broken down alphabetically by major, and devotes about 2-3 pages per major. All of the large majors are covered,along with some more emerging fields of study. For each major the author tell you the typical subjects you might study, the typical occupations associated with the major, and some of the qualities you need to have to find success in the field. There is also a section that tells you what the people commonly found in the field enjoy as leisure activities. For instance, people who are interested in volunteer activities and helping out at senior centers might be suited to social work. If you are drawn to law you may find leisure in debates and reading law reviews in your spare time. I thought this was the best way to use the book actually - to look at my leisure interests and match them to the right field of study (I found 3 fields). There is also a self-assessment section and a listing of organizations associated with each major. The author also lists the main reasons why someone who enter the field, and it is a good way to see if your values match the major. I found the book helpful overall and would recommend it for someone who is uncertain of what to major in or what fields to pursue.

This book was a gem! I was hooked from beginning to end on the character of Ellie Winters, and was sad to reach the end of the book. The ending - the entire book actually - was very satisfying. Ellie, an almost 30 year old litigation attorney, has great friends, a string of ex's, a so-so relationship with her family, and goes to a job every day that isn't fulfilling. Her life takes a turn when she meets Ted Langston, a 50 something newsman from Washington D.C. The story follows the budding May-December romance between Ellie/Ted, and the problems they encounter along the way. If felt that the character of Ellie was very mature in her decisions and actions, and yet also very girly - she makes the same mistakes all of us women seem to make when we're falling in love, and she is very easy to identify with and like. I was really pulling for Ellie the whole time and enjoyed her character very much. The cover art is hideous and hides what is a very remarkable debut book. Definitely qualifies as above-average chick-lit. I look forward to Gaskell's next book and hope it's as great as this was!

As with her first book, Pushing 30, I enjoyed True Love (and Other Lies) quite a lot. On her way to London, Claire Spenser, a discontented travel writer, meets Jack, a handsome man who soon becomes her everything. The problem? He is her best friend's ex-boyfriend. This minor problem becomes the central focus of the story and everything stems from the complications involved when dating your best friend's ex. The other complication is Claire's low self-esteem and the way she constantly compares herself to others in a negative light; the book seemed to be a lot about Claire and her personal demons. There was a major point of discontent with me in this book: the `friendship' between Claire and Maddy... it just didn't seem as deep and continuing as we were meant to believe it was. Maddy was drawn as a vengeful, sour, and altogether mean woman who made, and makes, life difficult for Claire. I just didn't buy into the friendship or the eventual reconciliation. But, I did like Jack and his mile-long romantic streak, and the way in which he treated Claire. Overall, it was a good book and kept me interested.

This book actually contains two stories that were previously published in the late 80s. The first story involves co-benficiaries to an estate, and the second is about two competing ranchers. I found the second story more believable and interesting than the second; it was a classic love/hate relationship with lots of character drama. Roberts' books have been republished lately with amazing speed, but these are definitely better than some of her early stories that are currently on shelves. If you're a romance fan, you'll enjoy them.

This is definitely one of Neggers' better books, although it was written almost 10 years ago. Finding You is the story of Daniel Foxworth and Constance (Cozie) Hawthorne, a couple that meets up in Vermont after a tragic accident. Daniel, a helicopter pilot is shouldering the blame for a recent helicopter crash and is out to prove his innocence - mainly by casting suspicion on Cozie's brother Seth. Meanwhile, Cozie - a bestselling author and newswoman - is haunted by prank phone calls. Cozie and Daniel are both at the center of an unraveling mystery, and the dynamic between Daniel and Cozie is pretty good; you get a good feel for their attraction to one another and yet you know they are both very strong individuals. The family ties, particularly between Cozie and her brother, Seth, were well written, and the entire story was, in fact, about family. The Hawthorne family, which used to be powerful in this small-town Vermont area, and the new powers, the Vanackerns. The scenery really stands out in this book as well - Neggers does a good job of painting a nice picture of Vermont in the fall/winter and providing some details about clothing and such - you can really imagine how Cozie and Daniel would look. I wish Cozie had been a bit more feminine though - her character was pretty brusque and manly at times and I had a hard time eventually believing she would be a happy homemaker.

The concept of this book is extremely cute (and optimistic)... a Brirish woman in her 30s sets out on dates around the world to find her soul mate. Although she has a great job (as a travel writer) she doesn't devote nearly as much time to her romantic life as she does to her work. So, she writes some emails to her network of worldwide contacts and has people in various countries set up 80 dates for her with foreign men. There should be nothing wrong with this book, right? It sounds fabulous - we are about to see a young, adventurous woman traverse the globe to find "THE ONE." But... it wasn't that great. The problem - SPOILER ALERT - is that as soon as Jennifer meets her soul mate (on date #55), she pretty much hands the book over to him and loses interest in her remaining 25 or so dates. She gushes on and on about this guy and it becomes the focus of the book. She asked friends what to do after she met "the one" - keep dating or stop - and she opted to keep dating. So, the remaining dates are really uninteresting because you know she is just doing it to complete her `mission.'. The initial 54 dates just don't capture you - in fact, I really wasn't `hooked' at all after the first 3 dates and read the book with little enthusiasm. Instead of being really interesting, Jennifer is quite boring as a travel mate and I really didn't end up liking the book at all. Give it a try and form your own opinion.

This book was very cute, and worthy of 5 stars because it delivers a funny, romantic, energetic, and modern love story. Although the title may be off-putting to some, this book is thoroughly modern ! The references (i.e. Buffy the Vampire Slayer and all the latest in condom-wear) keep the book from taking itself too seriously, and the result is some very funny scenes involving the two characters. Admittedly, some of the scenes did go on a bit long, but overall it didn't detract from the story. The main character, Lucern is more of an old-fashioned romantic than a vampire, and the vampire references are actually pretty minimal. The story is first and foremost about a romance, and the vampire thing is just secondary in this book. The characters are very funny at times, and very romantic too. I look forward to Etienne and Rachel's story in Love Bites. Recommended!

There was nothing bad about this book, but it definitely won't rank amongst the best chick-lit of the year. The main characters - Charlie and Jas - are roommates for a short period of time before an `incident' separates them and creates a divide in their friendship. The former roommates meet up again about 3 years later on a flight and start anew. Jas joins a tour that Charlie is booked on and the two develop a friendship again while traveling the countryside with their tour group and guide. The book is slim on adventures and also on character development. Jas seemed very different than he was originally written, and there were quite a few gaps in the story, particularly about Charlie and her health. The one thing this author did well was in leaving enough `time' between when Jas and Charlie were roommates and when they met again; I really felt enough time/pages had passed that by the time they met again, they were two completely different characters. It was an interesting literary trick on the part of the author, but really didn't make the book any better.

Aisling Grey (sounds like a British tea or something) sets off to Paris to deliver an antique artifact to an important woman and finds herself mixed up in an underworld of dragons, demons, doppelgangers and more. While the plot is funny at times, and in particular the dog/demon Jim, there wasn't enough substance to call this book great. The great romance here is between Drake (a dragon wyvern) and Aisling, but the romance is more heat and passion than true love. The story was more about Aisling than the romance anyway, and that's obviously because the author is turning this into a series. It's a good idea but I wish the book would have just ended instead of having a continuation.. The characters weren't so engaging as to warrant another installment, or two, or whatever is planned. I enjoy Macalister, but her modern romances are better than this paranormal nonsense.

I received this about 2 years ago, when it was first released and very expensive. It is still the only MP3 player I have ever owned and does the job. Compared to newer MP3 players this is a `toy', with limited functionality, memory, and lack of video, pictures, etc. It is extremely basic. The biggest problem is with battery life - it is horrible!! Absolutely horrible battery life. It uses 1 AAA and it eats through batteries like crazy. That has been the biggest downfall. The software it's bundled with is ok, but not very intuitive; I still have a hard time figuring out how to transfer music easily. The player is extremely compact and the headphones are ok - nothing fancy. I've used the voice recorder a lot and also the FM radio, and both offer good reception. The on/off dial is a button that you have to hold down and it takes quite a while to start up/shut down. You can scroll through songs, fast forward, rewind, and the songs seem to be played alphabetically by song title (unless I just haven't figured how to change that). This isn't a player for people who love music, because it doesn't hold too many songs - between 60 and 120. I've outgrown this, and technology has surpassed what this player is capable of; this is a bare-bones player that doesn't hold much and doesn't do much. Great for a run in the park, but the battery probably won't even last that long. Unlike others, this has never broken on me or malfunctioned. There are much better options available now in MP3 players, so look around for something better.

I've read the entire series, and although Lucian has always been a central and interesting character in other books, his own story was rather weak. Lucian becomes involved with Leigh, a mortal, when a rogue hunting goes awry. The book was definitely more comedic than others in the series, but the romance between Lucian and Leigh was lacking. There was romance, yes, but it took almost the entire book for it to come to fruition. That was a bit disappointing. It was still a very fast and enjoyable read though, and I'd recommend it. There are several more characters that could potentially have their own stories, so I hope the series continues.

Another wonderfully written book by Barbara Bretton. The storyline is about a mother (Rose)-daughter(Maddy) relationship that is fraught with misunderstandings and distance. Despite having lived apart for many years now, Maddy moves back to her hometown and takes a job working alongside her mother. The story follows the two women through this transition and we see Rose and Maddy get to know each other once again, partly because of Hannah, Maddy's young daughter. Instead of a romance taking senter stage, the relationship between the mothers and daughters is at the forefront and th romance is slim to none, really. The book was well-written although a bit far-fetched in terms of realism. Maddy and her family are linked with another local family, the O'Malley's, through a teapot and a dying matriarch. There was a bit of supernatural involved with tat part of the story and that detracted from it somewhat, but overall it was a good read and well worth the time.

This was an interesting book - the writing wasn't bad, so it was entirely readable and decent in comparison to many chick-lit books. But, there were a lot of problems with the main character, Ashley, and her relationship with those around her. The book is Christian in theme, and there are several references to Ashley's spirituality and church activities. As a non-Christian I wasn't bothered by the religious references but by the story overall. This is the third in a series of Ashley Stockingdale books, and since I didn't read the first 2, perhaps I'm not as familiar with Ashley as some others are. But, I was very unimpressed by Ashley and her lack of backbone when it came to dealing with her own life and future. She was completely overrun by her fiances' family - his mother and sister in particular - Ashley let them belittle her constantly and make her look like less than a woman in front of Kevin, her fianc&eacute;. It wasn't until the final 2 or 3 pages that Ashley stood up for herself and even then, it seemed uncharacteristic of her. You just know that the problem was not resolved and that Ashley and Kevin will have a terrible marriage. There was very little expression of love between Ashley and Kevin too - a few kisses here and there were not enough t convince me that they had a tight bond - Kevin was gone a majority of the time, he didn't stick up for Ashley when his family belittled her, and he expected her to give up her life and dreams to move to another state with him. He mentioned they would discuss the move, but basically he gave her an ultimatum - marry me and move or see ya. I'm not sure I want to be Christian if Ashley is representative of the principles and actions that Christian women take for their man. For a much better glimpse of a Christian woman and the choices they make, I'd recommend the book "Emily Ever After" instead.

Poor Stephen McQueen - he is a 30something man with dreams of becoming the next .. Steve McQueen! Although he shares his name with a famous movie star, Stephen has little else in common with the Hollywood elite. For starters, he lives in London, and is merely the understudy to the insanely popular Josh Harper. Josh epitomizes everything Stephen wants to be - he's famous, extremely good-looking, sought-after by women, directors, and fans, and is married to a beautiful woman named Nora. Stephen is, basically, an unlucky fellow; nothing seems to go his way, and he is still waiting for his 'big break' after many years of trying. He's an adequate father to his only daughter Sophie, a friend to his ex-wife Alison, and a better than average friend to Josh Harper, a man who treats him like gum beneath a shoe. There isn't a lot of dramatic tension in the novel - it is more of a character study and a glimpse into Stephen's life. David Nicholls captures the essence of a man who is a good person but just down on his luck and needing a break. Stephen is a character that you love to read about and that you want the best for. There is a lot of humor/wit in this book and I was laughing aloud many times throughout the novel. A Question of Attraction was one of the best books I have ever read, and The Understudy ranks right up there with it. Both books have a solid cast of characters that are `normal' and easy to identify with. There is a Josh Harper in all of our lives, and seeing Stephen try to triumph over one made for a very funny and engaging read.

Let's face it... you don't read a book like this, or pick it up, if you don't already know that something is wrong with your current/past relationships. The book is short, easy to read and understand, and speaks directly to us - women who give too much in relationships and do not get half of what we give in return. The 'letters' the authors use to illustrate their points are pretty phony, but the message is clear (he's not into you), and you will undoubtedly recognize yourself in many of the scenarios. The concept of 'he's just not that into you' isn't particularly unique, but it's empowering to read and, if only for a short time, remember your own worth. The book, co-authored by a male and female (although the male writer seems to be doing all of the talking/explaining) is cutesy as well - they have 'exercises' at the end of each chapter that are lighthearted and fun (for example, color a blank flag with a red crayon and keep a look out in the future for red flags). I particularly enjoyed the end.. the authors speak about 'what to do next." Often, books will explain things to you and then leave you pondering over what to do with all the information. Not so here - the authors actually offer suggestions for the future and some advice to overcome unhealthy relationships. Another plus is that the book tackled issues that went beyond simple dating - they also talk about marriage and alcohol and how to make sense of these 'bigger' subjects. I would definitely recommend this book, not necessarily because it's well-written, but because it can particularly help someone who is just getting out a relationship (or someone who needs to). He's just not that into you is definitely something to keep in mind and I think I just might in the future thanks to this little book.

I've read several of Jill Mansell's books and, while this wasn't a favorite, it did have all the elements that make it enjoyable anyway. Mille and Orla are two women who need one another badly - Millie needs some excitement in her (love) life, and Orla needs another hit book after being in a writing slump. Orla `hires' Millie to relay her adventures to her for a hefty sum; in return, Orla writes about Millie, her love life, her friends, and her job. Along the way Millie meets some guys (mostly through Orla, but some on her own). One man that Millie finds, Hugh Emerson, comes with a gorgeous face but a lot of baggage. Whether or not he and Millie can work through his issues is central to the story. My only complaint with this book - and all her others too - is that the hero/heroine take a very long time to come together. In a book that closes in on 500 or so pages, that's a long time to wait for the romantic reward.

I just finished this book and I'm still trying to decide if I liked it or not! The storyline involved Meredith Greene, a psychologist, and her relationship with Erik Admundssen, a professional glacier trekker/climber. The relationship is doomed from the very start, but unfortunately Meredith is lovesick and completely blind to the faults of Erik. The problem I had with the storyline was (un)believability - Meredith was supposedly a professional psychologist with some intelligence, yet she managed to get involved with a suspected murderer and then continues to cover for him when he is implicated in a second murder. Her relationship with the lead investigator, John McCord, could have been explored a lot more, but his character was introduced very late in the book and didn't have too many opportunities to really get to know Meredith. There were just way too many loose ends in this book that were never tied up and relationships that were left half explored. There was a lot of potential in the storyline but it wasn't realized. There also seemed to be a distinct change in writing from chapter to chapter (like one author wrote the one chapter and then the other took over) - Lynn Erickson is two people for those who didn't know. Anyway, it was o.k.

The book is long (almost 500 pages), and after all those pages I felt terribly slighted by how it concluded. It's no mystery how the plot will go, but the getting there was a lot of fun. This book was like a giant soap opera, with multiple characters, multiple conflicts, multiple sex partners, and characters with money and power. The lead characters - Milly and Bobby - are two of the only decent people in the book and even then, they make horrendous mistakes that lead you to dislike them along the way too. They have a romance/connection that didn't `come together' for the entire length of the book and it lead to a disappointing end. I enjoyed the horses/racing theme (regardless of accuracy issues), but was hoping for a more romantic read. Despite my own wants, the book was quite gripping - it was character-driven and you do want to know what horrible mistakes they will all make next.

This was the first time I had read a Brandt book, and I'm happy to say it won't be the last. This book mixed together romance, comedy, and even touched on some family values. While some of the comedic scenes are a bit far-fetched, on the whole, it was a very enjoyable book. The writing was fast-paced and entertaining, the storyline continued at a reasonable pace and there were a lot of supporting characters that were well drawn too. The only part I had trouble with was the end - there was a bit of an unexpected twist that really came out of nowhere and made the plot slightly less believable. Overall.. it's well worth your time!

Ok, so I hve tried Almased based on the mainly positive reviews. The taste is fine - not sure why so many people have an issue with it at all. It mixes very well with almond or soy milk and tastes like a vanilla milkshake.Admittedly, with water as the mix it wasn't so great, rather pasty. Anyway, I did the 3-day fasting and maintained it very well (along with exercise) and noticed more side effects than pounds lost. I was tired and somewhat irritable the second day and found myself missing food and wanting some. Almased is excellent at controlling hunger for about 4 or 5 hours for me and then I get a bit anxious and want some food. It definitely fills you up though, so high marks for that. I didn't experience any upset stomach/bowel/gas and my system was very natural on this stuff. I am, for the record, very thin already and was using this just as a fasting/detox technique and not a weight loss aid. I am not sure how well it will work long-term, but since I had good results with Almased controlling hunger I will continue to use it as a replacement for one meal per day.

Annie Goldman and Joe Russo should have been a great love story - imagine the Thorn Birds - a man is a priest and is pining away for a woman he once loved. He quits the priesthood to be with the woman.. And.. Everything should be romantic and beautiful, right? Wrong. Although the love story could have been great, it wasn't. Annie and Joe were both one dimensional characters with barely enough substance between them to keep the book interesting. I wasn't impressed with this book, despite liking the first book The Trouble With Mary. What to do About Annie was missing the humor and wit that was evident in the first book, and it was also missing the romance and likeability. Skip it.

What a disappointing book! I usually like Nora Roberts, but this book was a major let-down considering Mia seemed to be the main character. I really expected her story to shine and I really expected that Sam wouldn't be easily forgiven; forgiveness came with no effort on his part at all. The chemistry between the two characters was weak and relied upon their history as children instead of their present personalities. This was by far the weakest of the three in this series and I'm definitely going to be more cautious when buying Roberts' books -- they used to be on my automatic purchase list, but now they're not. This is certainly not a book that warrants above 3 stars. Save your money and borrow a friends' copy!

I didn't read the entire book, and most people I would guess also wouldn't read it cover to cover. This book is more like a travel guide to the burial sites, libraries, and birth homes of the presidents. I was interested in the book to see if there were any presidential sites near me (there are only 2), so the usefulness of this book was limited by the fact that I cannot visit 99% of the places discussed. For each of the presidents the author gives a brief snapshot of the person. There is about 1-2 pages devoted to each of the `lesser known' presidents and about 5-10 pages for the likes of Washington, Lincoln, etc. You are also given travel information - city/street maps to locate the places (which aren't very helpful), and museum hours, admissions, etc. The best part of the book were the color photos of the presidents' homes and the US map that shows the distribution of the presidential monuments. I'm not really sure I even get the purpose of this book - it doesn't offer any information that is new or interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book because all of the information it contains can be found with far better accuracy and depth on the Internet; via the museum or library websites you would get much more background information about the President you need information on with up-to-date info on hours, admissions, etc. *This review is for the 1995 edition*

This was a wonderful introduction to Chicago and definitelymade my trip more enjoyable. I have used many of the top 10/eyewitness travel guides throughout the years, and really feel that Top 10 Chicago was one of the best. It captured the best the city has to offer, and was perfect for someone who had less than a week in the city. With the help of my Top 10 guide I made it to 8 of the 10 top sites. One of the best features of this book is its size - it's compact, chock-full of information, and easily fits into any bag/purse. The book also included a very helpful subway/street map and, because the book is so thin, I didn't feel like I was being conspicuous when I referred to the guide in public. DK continues its tradition ofincluding top-notch photography, and there was also a lot ofbackground information about each of the Top 10 sites. Mybook was a copyright 2004 and all of the information (prices, free museum days, discounts) was still the same ; I would definitely recommend this book for your upcoming Chicago trip but, like with any guidebook, make sure it's the most recent version you can find so dates, times, etc. are still useful. Highly recommended!

This small, compact book offers a bit of everything - it's a travel log, a recipe book, and an inside view of a family business. The topic of breadmaking is interesting and the opening chapters are especially fun to read because of Mayle's descriptions. The book feels 'warm' and inviting, even if you don't necessarily want to bake bread. The first few chapters are an introduction to cafe Auzet and the Auzet family, and the subsequent chapters include ways to recreate their famous loaves. The book also includes a chapter on choosing the appropriate wine for each bread type. The book was an easy and quick read. I miss Mayle's travel-fiction work and, although the book is cute, it doesn't have broad appeal.

Natalie Dorsett is a long-term tenant in a Louisville boarding home and, when Jack Miller moves in, he shakes up her life. Jack is a sexy, but suspicious character who may (or may not) be connected to the Mob, and Natalie and her busybody landlady spend their days and nights conjecturing about Jack's life. I won't ruin the surprise, but suffice to say that Natalie and Jack find a way to romance one another despite his career choice. The book was fun, and funny, and made me laugh out loud quite a lot. The only drawback was that Natalie was a lot more interested in Jack than he was in her; the story started to get too much desperate-girl-chasing-guy for my tastes but was cute to read anyway.

I really tried to like this book - the cover was so pink and engaging - very feminine. However, the text was very choppy and the story just didn't `flow.' The main character, Charlotte, lives in NYC with several of her college friends, and together they form a loose cooking club that meets once a month. The recipes were nice but the characters were straight from Sex and the City. Although the tv characters had much more depth and interest. There are 6 girls total in Charlotte's group, and for that reason alone the authors could not adequately develop each of those characters; you get snippets of their personalities. In fact, even the main character - Charlotte/Charlie - isn't well-developed. Most of her story takes place outside of the actual text - there are oodles of `blanks" in this book; significant incidents that are mentioned but were never written out as scenes. The book started off great in the first few chapters but went downhill very fast and was hard to read for the most part. Don't let the cute cover fool you - this is a poorly written chick-lit book.

This was a very well written romantic suspense. The subject matter was a religious cult and the impact it had on the life of a woman (Julie) and her child. The cult was eradicated many years ago, but stories about it and people associated with it resurface in Julie's adult years and she is forced to revisit the pains of her past. She is a strong woman, who is drawn very well, and can be tender at times, aggressive, fun, and loving, especially towards her daughter. Her romantic pairing is with her television reporting rival, Seth, who eventually helps her sort through her past demons. The book was very lively, particularly because of the verbal sparring between the two main characters. Although the subject matter (the religious cult) was a bit weird at times to read about (particularly towards the end of the book) it was woven in really well. I enjoyed this book, would recommend it, and look forward to reading more by this author.

San Francisco: 4 Romances Blossom by the City by the Bay is a compilation of four short stories: Grace in Action, Landlord Takes a Bride, Meet My Sister Tess, and Unbreakable Hope. The stories were written from 1999 to 2003, and all of them are very Christian in theme and writing. The first story, Grace in Action, is about a fireman and a very poor woman and her child. The fireman befriends the woman and begins to date her, much to the sadness of his girlfriend Emily. In fact, Emily shows up in the last story, Unbreakable Hope. The first and last stories are a slight continuation of one another and have characters that overlap. The best story, in my opinion, was The Landlord takes a Bride - both the male and female characters were strongly written, and the emphasis on church, God, and Christianity was less intense. The weakest story was Meet My Sister, Tess; it is about an adult female taking care of her disabled adult brother, and not being able to function independently of a man. Because Tess is so poor and her brother is disabled, the references to God were all over the place - it was actually very tedious to read through and I was just wanting it to end. This writer is not particularly good; the stories are about 50-75 pages each but are not intense enough to grab your attention and make you want to continue reading. The setting of San Francisco played a very minor role in the book, and the cover gives the impression that the stories will pay tribute to the city. They didn't; the author mentioned very few places in the city and it wasn't exploited at all. It's a shame, because perhaps the book would have been better with more focus on the setting and less on God and Christianity. I would definitely skip this book.

Reeling from her father's suicide and her fianc&eacute;e's betrayal, Tracey Sullivan moves to Greece to work as a ghostwriter for a famous celebrity. The celebrity, Urania, is a B-movie actress who makes life less than perfect for Tracey. Tracey's spirits (and romantic life) are uplifted by the appearance of Mark Varney, her literary agent. The story is pretty basic actually -Tracey moves to Greece and meanwhile, back in Miami, her friend Maribel discovers that Tracey's father may have not actually committed suicide. The closeness between Maribel and Tracey was one of the best parts of the story, in fact, Maribel would have been a more interesting lead character. She is strong, vibrant, colorful, and a go-getter. By contrast, Tracey is often quiet, meek, retiring, and lets others take advantage of her. While Maribel investigates on behalf of Tracey in Miami, another mystery starts to unfold at the Greek villa. Urania and her staff are keeping secrets that Tracey must uncover in order to learn the truth about herself. The book wasn't (and isn't) memorable, but was an ok read.

This was a light, fun read, as were the past two in this series. The characters are so reminiscent of the TV series it's like watching the show all over again. And, even if you are not familiar with the Diagnosis Murder TV show, you will appreciate the characters. The story is about a double murder that takes place in Hollywood and involves movies stars and, of course, Mark Sloan. The only thing I didn't particularly like about this book was that we know who the murderer is immediately. Instead of trying to figure out whodunit, this is a `how did she do it' mystery. There is no secret as to the murderer, and that kind of left me wishing for more. Still looking forward to many more in this series though - the mystery is lighthearted, and the characters are funny.

This was another Crime of Fashion Mystery, and was just as satisfying as the first installment. The writing is witty and fun, the character of Lacey Smithsonian is well-drawn, and the supporting cast of characters adds a lot to the book. The mystery/death is linked to Lacey's past as well, and I found that historical element - particualrly about 40s fashions - made the book even more enjoyable. Looking forward to the next book...

This is, perhaps, the worst Jill Mansell book available. None of the characters are likeable, and the storyline, which starts off rather well, is long and drawn out. The book goes on about 400 pages too many and, by the end, I found myself not even caring how the book ended, just happy that it did. The Monahan brothers - Max and Ross - run a very posh/lucrative hotel and use their status to bag lots and lots of women. Hundred between them - they are both love em' and leave em' types and no one can get them to commit to a relationship. Tessa and Holly are best friends with their eyes set on Ross and Max; they spend the entire book either chasing the men or running from them, and meanwhile, the guys continue their affairs without regard for Tessa and Holly. The problem with this book was with the characters; they are deeply flawed (all of them) and, the men in particular, make no excuses for their behavior/affairs. In fact, you get the impression that they really mean what they say - they don't want a relationship and the women who are trying are just foolish. The light comedy that injects itself into most Mansell books was missing from this book and I wouldn't recommend it.

This book was listed as a mystery and, although it begins with a suspicious death, this is not a whodunit. Rather, The Tale of Hill Top Farm is a country tale that follows the life of Beatrix Potter and the townsfolk. There is a very interesting group of people in the book and they are all fictional (with the exception of Beatrix and William Heelis). Basically, Beatrix purchases the Hill Top Farm in the small village of Near Sawrey, and the book follows her interactions and struggles. It is weird - at first - to read a fictional book starring a real-life person; plus, the small animals in the book have spoken lines. The animals talk to the humans, but they can't be heard except to other animals. While some reviewers were put-off by the talking animals, I thought it was a sweet addition, and the animals actually help move the plot along. The story is rather `slow' in the sense that there is no action, really. This is a character-driven book in the small country, so you won't zip through this book at the same pace as an adventure or typical mystery. The book reminded me (a bit) of the Mitford series by Jan Karon, but without the religious messages. Overall, the book is very charming and I'll continuing reading the series.

I have every Soul Ballet cd and have been very impressed with Trip the Night Fantastic, especially, and Dial It In. I was super eager to get this CD, and super disappointed that it really isn't as great as their previous efforts. The songs lack uniqueness - they all blend together and there isn't one track that really stands out and makes you want to play it again and again. There are 10 tracks on the main cd, and then a bonus cd with 3 songs. There is also more singing/lyrics on this cd than on any previous ones; the same girl is singing in the background on many of the songs and disrupts the flow of the music. I would have liked less of her and more music that was distinguishable. However, it does still sound like Soul Ballet and you will recognize some of the beats from previous cds if you own any. I would recommend it, but not highly.

This was a fun book - it's not great writing or literature but, hey, it'll give you a few laughs and pass the time. Meg is an events planner and has unknowingly rented Matt Rossi's estate for her latest event (a murder mystery weekend). The uptight Matt and free-spirited Meg are a great match - they have funny conversations, and great chemistry. I was impressed by this small book and would recommend it.

This is part of a series - I didn't know that, but the book can stand alone anyway. Is it ok to be unimpressed by this book? The cover drew me to it but, overall, I didn't find Melanie or her exploits all that entertaining. Melanie just came back from a trip to Spain where she met Miguel, a boy her age who comes to NYC and visits her there. Melanie shows him the sights and, along the way, we meet her friends and her other `love interest', Justin. The book is written in a diary format, and some of the drawings and rhymes were cute (but got annoying too). I would marginally recommend this book; the age group seems to be lower than the actual intended audience. The book also contained a lot of English/Spainsh words and translations, but did the author really have to spell out each Spanish word (LIKE THIS)? I found that really annoying and condescending too.

Three sisters - Paige, Sophie, and Mickey - share the lead in this character-driven book. Each sister has a `section' within the book, where the story is told from her perspective. So, you end up with 3 different perspectives on the same story. The story here is about the women - the changes they are going through in their romantic, work, and family lives. Although each of them have different challenges - mostly of a romantic nature - they have one major thing in common - a strong bond with one another. Plus, their divorced mother and father and planning to remarry after going through a terrible divorce. A lot of the story is about forgiveness, as Sophie and Paige must both face some hard truths about the men in their lives. The story was fun, and a breeze to read through, but I was a little put-off by all of the baby references and pregnancy talk. I came away from the story liking Paige and her character/life the best, and I'm sure for everyone who reads this they can identify with one of the sisters.

Death by Hollywood is one of those books you just keep reading in an effort to figure out why you keep reading it. Is the story going to get better? Are the characters going to improve? Where is the story actually going? The book was ok. I got the distinct impression reading it that this book was written for Bochco's Hollywood friends and supporters more than for the public-at-large. There are a lot of &quot;in&quot; references that won't really have any impact on people not affiliated with the biz. I felt like an outsider looking in on this story and it didn't really involve me as much as I'd hoped. Despite being about a murder, the book wasn't that graphic, but was definitely very heavy on profanity. It wasn't scholarly material by any means but was a quick read with some suprisingly good humor about the human existance.

Aided by wonderful watercolor illustrations, this is a heartwarming story that is just right for older children. There are several messages interwoven throughout the story - about love, friendship, compassion, and loss. The story involves a young girl, Sara, and the cheetah she finds and befriends. She helps to raise the cheetah, who she names Flag, for a few months, and her relationship with the animal brings attention to the breed. Their friendship opens the door to understanding not only for Sara, but for her classmates as well. I would definitely recommend this book - it isn't particularly long, but still manages to bring home a message about caring for wild animals.

I was amazed by the quality of this book. The writing, the characters, and the believability are all there. The characters - Naomi and Joe - are very 'real' - you are definitely not reading a formula romance - the characters have normal conversations, normal interactions, and a 100% believable romance. It's hard to explain, but the book was just .. perfect. I didn't feel as if I was dropping my level of intelligence to read this; in fact, the writing is quality and the conversations between characters feel like they are taking place in `real-time.' There were a lot of scenes that women can identify with, and I really liked how honest Naomi was - it was great. She didn't say the right things just to get the guy - she was her own woman, and when she didn't like something, she said that. The book was funny, sexy, intelligent. There was a minimal amount of swearing, and the characters really grew and developed throughout the novel. Every scene was necessary to the plot and I really liked how Naomi had body issues - it was overdone a bit at times, but it helped to bring more sensitivity to the character of Joe. Anyway, the plot was rather lame, but the book is character-driven anyway so it didn't matter much. The lead male - Joe - is very sexy, and his banter/interaction with Naomi was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the scenes between Joe and his family. Very high marks for this effort and I look forward to reading more from this author.

The book is ok. I was deceived by the cover somewhat; after a great experience with the Yellow Rose Mystery books by Leann Sweeney, I was hoping this series was going to be just as good. Not really. The main character, Helen, is a smart forty-something working as a telemarketer in order to avoid her ex husband. I really didn't think the whole story about Helen and her ex was believable, but I suppose it's the only way the author could place this otherwise smart woman in such deplorable working conditions. Helen just isn't exciting; she isn't a particularly good sleuth, and the story and characters weren't involving. I'd recommend this book with caution.

This storyline was drawn 99.9% from The Bachelor television series. The twist with this story is that one of the 25 women selected is a 'plant,' and she's actually a marriedinvestigative reporter (with a child). The writing was good, but there is no originality in terms of the storyline. It was a complete Bachelor takeoff; the book is ok to read if you're a die-hard Bachelor fan, but basically, if you've seen the show you don't need to read this book. The only difference between this book and the actual series is that The Bachelor on tv gives away roses and this bachelor lights a candle.

This book was moderately entertaining, but certainly not as good as the first book in this new girl detective series. Gilda is back in Detroit this time and attending a new school - Our Lady of Sorrows - that is haunted by the ghost of a former student. The mystery surrounding a dead student is actually pretty good, and Gilda uncovers a lot of cluesby searching around and asking questions. The problem is that Gilda is a freshman in high school, and she's investigating the 'case' as though she was a police officer -going around late at night in unsafe places, talking to parents at their homes, questioning teachers and administrators, etc. You definitely have to enter the realm of the unbelievable to enjoy the story. I noticed too that this book was less children-oriented than the last one. The first book featuring Gilda seemed suitable for about 5th grade and higher, but this book seems geared for a much higher grade level. Some of the language and the way in which Gilda talks back to her mother and (perhaps) stepfather sets a bad example for younger readers. I didn't remember Gilda being so contentious in the last book, and her character is certainly more harsh and unlikeable in this installment. I would recommend the book, but caution readers that if you enjoyed Gilda in the first book, she may prove less than appealing in this one.

I was very pleased with this book. This was a thorough introduction to body language and the exercises that the author recommends really help put it all into perspective. I finished the book last week and now find myself studying people all of the time, and constantly using the techniques the book describes to find out more about people. The book is easy to read and focuses on the main areas of body language - eyes, face, gestures, posture, proximity, etc. The information is introductory in nature, but the author provides titles at the back that you can use to explore the subject further. A practical book that was well worth the money.

I was disappointed with this book. Although I stuck with it and read it to the end, I was bothered by many of the lead characters, particularly Claire. Claire, the middle sister in the Davis family, was an evil, whining, shallow little bitch - to her brand new husband, and her sisters. I was pretty disgusted by her and found a lot of her actions mean-hearted and without cause. Oddly, Claire wasn't even the main character in the story - that is Rebecca Davis. Rebecca is a young 20something from Phoenix who dreams of a career in fashion design. For the past several years all she has done is dream because she is not actively pursuing her fashion interest. After a trip to California to attend her sister's wedding, Rebecca (Becca) decides to dump her ultra-stable boyfriend and head out to Hollywood to make it in fashion. She is very naive, and makes a lot regrettable decisions right from the start - she hooks up with a wild new guy, she signs contracts that finish her career before it even starts, etc. Becca was just as unlikable as her sister Claire, and her new boyfriend - Mike - was the only character that was interesting. But, after a few dates with Becca even he became boring in the end. The book was easy to read because it was so simplistic - a boring storyline with characters you won't end up rooting for and might even end up hating.

This book was beautiful. It has an enchanting cover and fine details throughout, such as cursive script for the chapter titles, little curves outlining the page numbers, and beautiful poetry to start each chapter; it's made up with details that make the book just .. beautiful. I felt 'rich' reading it - it's hard to describe, but the book and its setting (Cape Cod), made me feel elegant. The main character in the book is Willafred (Willa). Willa is 12 years old, and is struggling to find her identity; her mother constantly uproots them from city to city and Willa wants stability. Although her mother, Stella, is a wedding planner, Stella doesn't have love in her life, and Willa's fondest wish is to see Stella happy and married. Willa does a bit of matchmaking between her mother and Sam Gracemore, her English teacher. Stella is a very unlikable character; I wasn't interested in her happiness at all, and thought she could have been portrayed with more fullness. The picture we get of Stella is very removed, and even though Willa is the narrator, she does a poor job describing her first-hand relationship with Stella. The writing is very mature; what I mean by that is that the book really didn't seem suited to your average 12 year old girl. Despite the fact that Willa is 12, the readers who will find this book of interest will be much older teen girls. And white girls at that. The book has a limited audience, and the feeling you get is that it was written for rich white girls; they will definitely be more apt to identify with it than any other group. I hope it gets read though, because its beautifully written and just makes you feel pretty.

Something Blue is terrific! It's rare to find a follow-up book that is better than the first, but this book was truly amazing. It is a definite page-turner, and the main character, Darcy, lives a life of such drama and destruction that reading about her exploits, her personal agenda, and her conceited opinions of herself is like watching a very juicy soap opera. Like many, I disliked Darcy in the first book, and was wondering how the author was going to turn Darcy likeable. The good thing is... she didn't! At least for the first half of the book, Darcy is as bad as she ever was, and there was definitely a moment in the book (when she is talking to her former fianc&eacute; Dex about her baby) that made my jaw drop in horror at Darcy all over again. But, despite how bad Darcy is, I kept reading. My recommendation is that you read Something Borrowed before this book; the characters in Something Blue all overlap from the first book and, although the author spends abut 5-6 chapters recapping the storyline form the first book, you definitely need the first story as a starting point for this one. Anyway, in this book, Darcy has managed to alienate all of her friends and family, with the exception of Ethan, her childhood friend that she really isn't close to anyway. So, when she is left high and dry by her baby's father and realizes her `stock is plummeting' as an attractive female, she takes off to Europe and asks to stay with Ethan. Both Ethan and Europe are the catalyst for change in Darcy, and little by little she begins to rebuild her life and view her own personality in a different way. The good thing is that Darcy doesn't completely change; she is still wicked at times, thoughtless, selfish, opinionated, and maintains the spunk and meanness you expect from her. But, it was entertaining to read about Darcy, and very rewarding to reach the end and find that the story had evolved into something so enjoyable and heartfelt. I would definitely recommend this book, and look forward to the next book in this series, or just by Giffin at all. She is a talented storyteller and took a very difficult character and made her the heroine.

I was impressed by the illustrations, but little else. The illustrations are what make this book readable; it's not really a picture book that kids will enjoy. I got my copy from the library, and seeing as how it hadn't been checked out (ever in a year), it's obviously not popular. And, there are a lot of fairy tale references, particularly on the postcards, that most children won't even understand. Heck, even I didn't get that the initials were fairy tale characters until almost the end. I wouldn't recommend this book.

These are 2 short stories that are reprinted here in time for Christmas - "Home for Christmas" and "All I Want for Christmas." The stories are exceptionally short, and although they are cutesy, they really aren't worth reading. Home for Christmas is about a man who returns to his hometown after being gone for 10 years and starts up again with his old girlfriend. The second story, All I Want for Christmas, is a bit better and is about twin boys who set about matchmaking for their father.

This book contains two stories: Club Cupid by Stephanie Bond and Valentine Vixen by Joanne Rock. Club Cupid is a reissue of a story originally published in 1999, and Valentine Vixen is a very short story that is thoroughly boring and unenjoyable. Club Cupid is slightly better, but the book - overall - is not worth wasting your money on. The stories are both too simple; the characters do not have enough depth or feeling, the `romances' are unbelievable, and the writing is generic.

If you're interested in magical/fantasy stories, then this book will suit you perfectly. The gist is that Katie leaves her miserable job as a secretary to work as a verifier at MSI (Magic, Spells and Illusions), a company that creates spells and potions for an underground elf/fairy/magic clientele. Katie is `unmagical' and thereby able to see things in NYC that others cannot, such as talking gargoyles, women with wings, etc. Her `unmagical' nature is what leads MSI to recruit her for an open position. It's chick-lit in the sense that the main character is a female 20something that is a bit confused about her life but, it is missing a lot of the humor and wit generally included in chick-lit stories. Plus - and this was a major disappointment - there is very little romance in the story. Although Katie meets several men through work and her roommates, her only kiss in the novel is with a frog - not very romantic. I kept reading the book despite wanting to put it down, so something about the story must have been engaging but, overall, I would suggest trying something else to pass your time.

This was a remarkable book, and definitely the type of writing I'd like to see more of in chick-lit. Emily, a small town girl, moves to Manhattan to pursue her dreams, but struggles along the way to fit in with her new friends and co-workers. Her Christian values often conflict with the big-city lifestyle, and we watch as Emily goes through a series of changes throughout the book - at first she is shy and awkward, then makes herself over to fit in, and finally comes back to her own beliefs and finds her own voice. I'm not Christian, or even religious, but was not put off by the thread of Christianity in this book. Almost any 20something will be able to identify with parts of Emily, and the book did not preach Christianity or anything of the sort. The book used Emily's faith as a way to show her internal struggles to fit in, and fitting in with a new crowd is something we can all identify with. Emily was a super character - she was smart, ambitious, a girl's girl, sociable yet reflective, and very caring and thoughtful. Her character stayed 'in character' the entire time, and even when Emily started developing new habits (like drinking and making out with her boyfriend), Emily was always concerned with her actions. The book did have romance, in fact there was quite a bit of it - no, there were no sex scenes, but that wouldn't have worked in this book. There was a sweetness and purity to Emily that made her eventual relationship even more romantic and fulfilling to read about. The writing itself was engaging, and smart. And, the ending was satisfying - although I did hold out hope that Emily would come to love NYC!

This book had great potential, but seemed to sink about halfway through the story. The story is about Sofie Metropolis, a Greek girl who has gone against the family restaurant business and entered into private investigations. In this story, she's on the trail of a cheating wife, a missing dog, and a potential murder. I didn't like Sofie as a character - she wasn't funny, or smart, or pretty, and seemed to lust after someone for no apparent reason. Her familial background, and descriptions of foods are probably what kept me reading as long as I did. I made it 75% of the way through the book before deciding that I just didn't care about Sofie or her exploits. You can tell, without a doubt, that 2 different authors are writing this book (which they admit to), because the writing doesn't 'flow' from chapter to chapter. Very unimpressed - the book was sort of a Big Fat Greek Wedding takeoff, but not even close to as funny or charming. Read at your own risk.

This book was relatively short considering that the topic isso broad. The authors present approximately 10 ways in whichwe make an impression upon others. They then providechecklists at the end of each of the chapters to help youassess whether or not you give off the impression you intendto. The book is part psychology, part body language studies,and part common sense. The book didn't offer anything 'new,'but the format was easy to read and understand, and theauthors brought home certain points that you might miss indenser books on this subject.

I was impressed by this book - the wittiness, the subject matter in general (reality television), and the characters. Although Kat was a size 18 woman, I didn't feel as though the book portrayed either fat or thin women unfairly. In fact, Kat had a major attitude problem at times and the reality show did help to show a different side of her. The romance(s) turned out exactly as I'd anticipated and I have a feeling that Nick would have been Nick even if Kat was a size 4. The book was fun, and definitely worth your time.

Basically, Mr. Huntington St. John, an elite operative, tracks down a notorious jewel thief, Ms. Taylor Kincaid, and sparks fly. This is a romantic suspense book, with lots of action and some interesting twists. The romance was typical for one set amongst danger and adventure - it was more adrenaline than sweet, and more fast-paced than a typical love story. I felt that the first of the book was rather strong - Hunt and Taylor had a large role and as individuals they were written as interesting and exciting. But, by the time they started working together to thwart a larger threat (Jose Morales), the action was just ... overkill, and hard to follow, actually. The last of the book was a bit dull, in my opinion but, overall, the book was enjoyable and I'd recommend it.

An adult can read this book in 5 - 10 minutes, so keep that in mind when deciding if you should purchase it or look for the title in your local library. The book is, basically, about a `seed' that is planted and grows into a lovely blossoming vine along the trellis one spring. It's kind of like the story of the ugly duckling who turned into a swan.. the seed doesn't believe in its own worth, but its planter (known as The Nice Lady), believes in the seed. I wasn't impressed with the story; I suppose it's about nature and the Earth and the cycle of water, sun, etc., along with patience. But, I don't think a small child is going to really recognize all the nuances, and an adult is too old to care.

I enjoyed the love story between Angela and John. I only wish it wasn't ruined by Angela's recent past and subsequent `problem.' I'm not sure that her `problem' was necessary to move the story forward - the fact that they were opposing attorneys on a family case would have been difficult enough for their budding relationship. Overall, the story was witty in places and enjoyable. Recommended.

Mia is the younger sister of Angela from Criswell's previous book, The Trials of Angela. I enjoyed this story much more than some others in this series, because of the chemistry between Mia and Nick Caruso. Nick is an undercover FBI agent who hires Mia as his bodyguard; yes, it's implausible that a small little Italian girl could bodyguard a strapping guy, but Nick needs entry into Mia'a family and social circle. Under the guise of a nerd/author, he lives with Mia and it all develops from there. The romance was cute although towards the end I thought Mia turned a bit.. Maddening and immature. Donna's presence seemed to become more of a focus this time, so it seems likely that her story with Lou is forthcoming. Overall, recommended.

The book is extremely well written; the author has a way with words and sentences that you don't often find in modern literature/fiction. For that reason alone this book deserves to be read. The fact that the plot is enjoyable and mysterious is just a bonus. The book is a bit of a gothic romance/mystery and was not predictable until the very last section(s) of the book. The author was able to weave together several elements simultaneously and I didn't find any flaw in her storytelling. Others have made quite a to-do about Jane Eyre references in this book, but I don't think the book mimicked that story and I don't think it intended to. There was so much going on with the characters and the plot that focusing on the Jane Eyre element takes away from the greater story. It was just wonderful storytelling and quite hard to put down. There were some unnecessary elements, especially as they pertained to Margaret Lea - the biographer - but it is definitely worth your time if you enjoy and appreciate quality writing.

Three friends - Casey, Lindsay (aka Sin), and Kat - take a month to tour through Rome and Greece before returning home to face their new jobs and `adult' lives. That is the basic premise of this book. The book is well written, and is enjoyable mainly because Rome and Greece are well described. The scenery is the best part of the book, and I felt like I was on a European whirlwind tour with a bunch of 18 year olds. The problem is that the characters are not 18 - they are upper 20s women who act 18 a majority of the time. Although the author tells us that the three are best friends, they spend the entire book belittling each other and ostracizing Casey. Also, Casey, the lead character, is terribly boring - I didn't believe for an instant that she was ever exciting and carefree (as we are told she was), and the end certainly didn't fit with the picture we had of her character. This book is marginal - high marks for setting and descriptions, but low marks for character strength and consistency.

This was another in the long line of chick-lit books, and it wasn't that bad. It was quite readable, funny at times, and followed the life of Angie and her quest for love and mariage. The title and the back cover are a bit misleading - this book is not really about a woman and all her ex-boyfriends. I thought it would be, so I was surpised by that. Instead, the book is about Angie and her romantic life with her boyfriend Kirk, and how her past relationships (and his) may affect thier future. The end is very easy to figure out by the third chapter, but the getting there was half the fun I guess. This is a recommended book for light reading and lazy days.

This book was almost like a personal biography, and was quite disturbing to read in many respects because I could identify with Carrie. The book was initially very hard to get into, and I almost gave up on it, but by the middle of the second chapter I was able to get a better idea of where the story was headed. The book follows the life of Carrie Pilby, a female genius, and the problems she has fitting in and reconciling her own ideas with the people and world around her. It's a personal struggle for her to make friends, go to work, and motivate herself to do better. The irony of the story is that this girl genius is actually not very smart where it counts. She is socially inept, friendless, struggles just to make polite conversation, and lives life from inside her head. I thought the writing was very philosophical as about 80-90% of the book is musings on the state of our world (as seen through Carrie's eyes). The book is chick-lit, but not in the Bridget Jones kind of way - this is definitely more of a thinking book and is humorous only to the extent that the person at the heart of the story, Carrie, is struggling. The writing was insightful, but I'm not sure I would read anything by this author again. I was expecting a "light" read and this really wasn't.

Best thing - it's extremely accurate, and that is really the most important thing when choosing a pedometer. It stores 7 days of walking info - calories burned, distance walked, steps taken, and time spent in aerobic stepping. Very smooth and attractive product. Easy set up and it stores your weight and stride too. The product is great and can be worn in multiple ways.

This book is definitely one of the best in this subject category - self-help to get your life and career in focus. I've read many books similar to this; books that try to help you define your interests and career path, but none have been as well written and easy to understand as Now What? The book is geared towards those of us who might struggle with finding "IT" - that career or life direction that we want to take. Through a series of helpful exercises, Fortgang helps you get to the heart of your desires and uncover some of your interests. I was really surprised by what I discovered about myself through this book and would definitely encourage others who are "lost" to read it. The exercises are particularly useful, and the book was very readable and encouraging. Did I find "IT" through the reading of this book? Well, no. But, I did help gain clarity about separating interests and hobbies and that, for me, was a big issue. The only thing that seems unreasonable is the 90 day period of time; you'll want to read the book much faster and will likely find yourself finished long before 90 days has passed. That was the only problem with the book, placing a time frame on it. Otherwise, it was really helpful.

This book is categorized as a mystery, but is actually just general fiction. Sure, there happens to be a light mystery/death in the book but this definitely isn't a whodunit with clues everywhere and townspeople clammering to solve the case. The writing is beautiful - very gentle and easy to read - and it is odd too, to read a half-fiction half-realistic account of Beatrix Potter's life. Much of the book is fictionalized, but Beatrix and her gentle nature, kindness, and spirit all come through. I feel, through the stories of Albert, that I am coming to know Beatrix Potter very well. The exact same cast of characters from the first book, The Tale of Hill Top Farm, are back and it was great fun to read about them again and to continue their stories. This book can stand alone, but would be more enjoyable if it was read after the first book. In this story, the main plot is about finding the new teacher for Sawrey School, and the mystery surrounding the potential candidate. I was lulled into a sense of peace and happiness reading this book and look forward to reading even more about these characters in the next installment.

If you like mystery, romance, adventure/espionage, and a storyline that involves precious jewels, then you'll definitely find enjoyment with The Parisian Affair. The plot revolves around Allegra Sheridon, a jewelry designer in NYC who is called upon to bid by-proxy for a multimillionaire on an emerald ring in Paris. What Allegra doesn't know is that the ring she is bidding on has a long history behind it, and that certain people will stop at nothing to have the ring, including murder. Allegra travels to Paris to bid on the famous ring and, from there, is swept up in a variety of adventures and characters. Although the auction goes as planned, the events that follow endanger Allegra's life. Her boyfriend, Todd Hall, travels from NYC to be with her and also involves himself in the adventure. The book was a very quick, and enjoyable read. However, there were drawbacks in the story: 1) Allegra was described as creative, smart, ambitious, etc., and yet once she is in Paris it seems that she lost all of her common sense - her character shifted pretty dramatically 2) the relationship between Todd and Allegra seemed forced and while there was sexual chemistry, there was nothing that made me think they were truly in love and committed - Todd was portrayed as a cad/playboy the entire time; and 3) the ending was rather abrupt. Overall, recommended!

These stories are all ridiculous fantasy that center around witches, goblins, werewolves and mirrors. To enjoy these short stories you'll need to suspend reality for quite some time. They wouldn't be that bad if the writing was quality, but it really isn't. Each author only has about 40-50 pages of writing so there obviously isn't a lot going on in terms of character development, believability, and storyline. The stories were a bad trip to fantasyland and should be in the sci-fi section and not romance. Don't waste your time, especially with the latter two stories. They are completely unrealistic and written at about a 3rd grade level.

I really really really enjoyed this book and it's main character Abigail/Abby Cooper. I accidentally stumbled onto this series and I cannot stop reading them. The plot has been explained time and again through the reviews - a psychic intuitive lends a helping hand to solve crimes - so I just wanted to add my kudos to this series and author. I especially like Abby's relationship with Dutch and his partner Milo; it was a pleasure to read a mystery that had so much romance in it, too :-) I felt connected to the character of Abby and felt that her words and actions were extremely realistic (and fun). Highly recommended.

I enjoyed this book and the in-depth look at the criminal justice system in Oklahoma County. The writing - as in Fuhrman's other books - was top notch. The book attempts to show us - through a series of criminal cases - how the death penalty in Oklahoma County may be overused, particularly by one Bob Macy (the county DA). At times I did feel like this was mostly an expose of Bob Macy and his crime lab assistant, Joyce Gilchrist. While I did come away with a feeling of dislike for both the work of Macy and Gilchrist I'm still not convinced that the death penalty is wrong. Fuhrman looked at isolated cases in just one county, and in a rather unpopulous state at that. The book was good, but I missed the "detectiveness" that was in all of Fuhrman's other books. I felt in this book that he was just relaying a series of events that I could read about anywhere, whereas in his other books he was an active searcher/researcher on the trail of something much more interesting and less mainstream. I also expected more interplay between him and the local townspeople, but we really aren't told how he went about his research, and there isn't much dialogue between him and anyone else. I will look forward to his next book but hope it is something more `detective-like' and not something written on topic that anyone could have done.

This book was not at all what I had anticipated. First, it is not even a full-length book, but a collection of 3 short stories that are loosely centered around online dating/emails. The stories are about 70 pages each, and if you believe a great story can be completed in that small of a space, then you won't have a problem with this book. However, if you're looking for quality writing, characters with more than one dimension, and a storyline that is interesting and exciting, then you will hate this book. The three short stories are basically just sex scenes - there is no substance, no connection between the characters, and the scenes aren't even "hot." Skip this book.. save your hard-earned money.

I absolutely adored the first book in this series - The Boy Next Door - but felt that this book, in comparison, was way overdone. It's cutesy, but... that doesn't make it quality. Cabot's previous book was written entirely in e-mail format, but this book takes it a step further. Now, we have e-mails, IM messages, answering machine tapes, interoffice memos, to-do lists, professional letters, advertisements, etc. There is no actual dialogue between characters, and the entire storyline must be gleaned through the correspondence you are presented with. There was definitely humor throughout the book, but the problem is this.. the storyline didn't flow because it was written in such a choppy manner. I didn't get a feel for the characters, and it was hard to follow because you have to refer back constantly to check for initials and code names and such; it was just bothersome after a while. In order to get &quot;the big picture&quot; for this book you have to pay attention to the little details, like the names on the letters, the way someone signs their name in an e-mail, the persons' official title. etc. This book takes the easy way out, and sacrifices content for a creative writing structure that doesn't actually work. Enough already with this format - simply reverting back to a 'normal' book structure would have made this book 100% more enjoyable. I understand it's quirky and irreverent, but 350+ pages of office memos and email is just .. too much work.

This is supposed to be a historical romance, but it doesn't really read that way at all. The setting isn't drawn realistically at all, and there are really only a few references to how life was in the 1900s. You can easy tell that the setting wasn't well-researched and that N.R.'s attempt to drawn a mental picture of the 1900s fails miserably. The main characters are thoroughly modern, and I just get the sense that N.R. didn't put too much effort into this book. The love story is cute, but so are a million others that are on the market. There is nothing remarkable about this story and nothing that would have you wanting to re-read it or recommend it to friends. This book was written well before N.R. gained in popularity, so I would skip it in favor of a more recent book of hers.

The best thing about this book is that it's readable - although references God and Him and Jesus are on every line, it speaks to the 'common man.' Actually, if you delete all of the religious references, you'd be left with a fairly decent self-help book. The seven areas of your life that could use improvement include: enlarging your vision, giving, working on self-esteem, watching what you do and think, letting go of the past, finding strength in adversity, and choosing to be happy. I started with the last chapter first, and worked my way through the book according to what seemed of interest. The book does not need to be read cover-to-cover, and you can dive in wherever is most appropriate for you. Although I'm not technically 'religious' and don't attend church, I could still appreciate the greater message in this book; the book is about self-improvement and is valuable for everyone, despite the religious overtones. The only problem I have with this book (and preachers in general) is that they are imperfect too.. how are we supposed to take advice from imperfect people? I don't understand that part, and it was made worse for me each time Joel Osteen referenced himself and pointed out that he also makes mistakes. There were 2 points of annoyance with the book: one, he tells the story of Carla, a woman who was having troubles with her co-workers. Throughout the book he mentions having positive thoughts and thinking well of yourself and others, yet Carla called her co-workers 'emotionally immature.' How is that ok? Carla is supposed to be 'above' her coworkers and elevate her thinking, but how Godly is she if she's thinking ill of them? The second thing that gave me pause was the story of a man who froze to death in a freezer; apparently he always thought negatively at work, and when he got stuck in a freezer one night his negative thoughts led to his death. However, the freezer was actually not even on and the temperature was 61 degrees inside; the whole story seems extremely unrealistic.

This was a short, sweet and innocent romance that should bring you a few hours worth of reading pleasure. A very simple love story about a heiress-turned-pauper camp counselor and an apple picker with money to spare. It isn't an outstanding book or fine fiction or literature, but it's Nora Roberts and worth a read to see how she has matured as a writer.

The best part about this book are the illustrations; they are rich in color and texture and give a really great sense of the richness of the character. The text, however, is wordy and is not well-suited for those of a picture-book age. There are text boxes to highlight important 'messages,' about kindness, friendship, mood, etc., and the overall impression is that the author is preaching to the reader. Instead of intertwining a story with a subtle message, the text is explicit and overly explanatory. The length of the book (50 pages) is far beyond what a normal toddler/preschooler will enjoy, and there is just way too much text in the story. The book requires tightening. Not recommended.

This DVD is 46 minutes of standing work only that blends pilates, ballet, and cardio together for a complete workout session. Ellen has a very soothing, non-aggravating voice and she gives clear instructions and time to prepare for the next movement. I like her casual reminders to breathe and how relaxing all of the movements seem. She won't have you jumping around and exercising 'hard' but you'll still get a great workout and have increased energy when you're done. There are a few issues with the DVD - first, the music. Unless you like jazz/Santana then you might not like the music playing along with the moves; there is no way to turn it off, so you have to just get used to it. Second, the length of the DVD is 46 minutes and it runs as a continuous workout, so you cannot break it down or select portions at will - you either play it all or cut it off when you get tired. Third, if you have Fit TV on cable - don't buy this DVD - Ellen is much better on Fit TV's Slowrobics than on this DVD, and the moves are almost identical. Plus, on the Fit TV Slowrobics show you get leg/floorwork that you won't get here. This Fusion DVD is just an expanded version of the Fit TV show, so just tape those and you have the same thing, with the added benefit of better music and better, more colorful outfits to look at.

This was another in the series of books and television specials that takes aim at Walmart. Dicker argues, as many others have, that Walmart is a big, evil company that is destroying the lives of Americans and lowering the standards of the country. Most of his argument is centered upon their labor practices and lack of unionization; whether the labor information in the book is factual or not I don't know, but he presents his argument in such a way to make Walmart look like a corporate devil. Personally, I love Walmart for their low prices, and the lack of customer service that Dicker bemoans doesn't bother this shopper. He also touches upon their overseas factories and goes over what we already know - overseas factory workers are paid meager earnings. But he, and others, often forget that any amount of money for overseas workers is a blessing; should Walmart raise wages overseas just because? These are issues for the government of the country in question, not Walmart. Obviously, this book is anti-Walmart but even if you're pro-Walmart you won't suffer by reading this book. I did find some of the information questionable, particularly towards the end when he cited Oregon as an anti-Walmart state. I happen to know that 3 Walmart Supercenters opened in the Salem area - that is 3 Walmarts within a 10 - 15 mile radius of one another, and another super center is 15 miles up the road in Woodburn. So I'm not sure how he came to the conclusion that Oregon was fighting off Walmarts. Although the book doesn't have positivity, it's insightful and interesting.

This is the second book in Dee Davis' Last Chance Triology; we meet Samantha (Sam) Waters and her love interest is Payton Reynolds from the first book, Endgame. Sam is a bomb specialist and is added to the Last Chance team when a series of explosions begin to look suspicious. This book was remarkably similar to Endgame, and that was bothersome. Although the plot was slightly different - chasing a bomber instead of a murderer - the romance was almost identical. Payton is the enigma in this romance, and was just as hard to penetrate as Gabriel was in the first book. And, like Madison before her, Samantha is the one who is placed in danger as a result of the bombings and Payton is off to her rescue. Honestly, the characters were too similar to make the book interesting, and even Nigel (another member of the team) makes several comments about how Payton/Sam are just like Madison/Gabe. I'm planning to read the last book, Exposure, because I think Nigel is at least a bit more outgoing than the other 2 men and his story will be more human.

I was very excited to read and own this book, and sadly disappointed when it arrived. Unfortunately, the book is very generic in its interpretations, and doesn't offer informative insight and analysis. The definitions are very vague and the book is for parlor games more than for true dream interpretation. I also expected a bit more illustration, but there were hardly any of those either; just a few abstract drawings. However, the biggest failure of this book and the place where it earns an "F" across the board is with the indexing and alphabetizing of the dream symbols. The index is basically nonexistent, and the symbols are not arranged alphabetically. For instance, when I attempted to look up "Mother," it was actually found under "Family." Also, when I tried to look up "travel," it was listed under "places" - the listings are VERY VERY hard to find and when you do finally find them they aren't very good. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's not even good enough to have fun with.

This book was ok. I have read better and I have read worse. It wasn't a romantic comedy, but more dramatic in the sense that it head a well conceived plot and a story that was going in a definite direction. I think the jacket tells the story already, so I won't be giving anything away by saying the main character (Rachel) sleeps with her best friend's (Darcy) fianc&eacute; (Dex). The story really isn't about the romantic relationships as much as it is about the friendship between Rachel and Darcy, and the realization that perhaps friendship is not always what it seems. There was a certain degree of sadness to this book - the main character was very sympathetic but also, at times, pathetic. She didn't have a lot of spine and I suppose her flaws made her well-drawn as a character in the book. I didn't get a `happy' feeling reading this book - despite some happy moments and a relatively good ending the writing was just too dramatic to be fun. It does keep you interested though, because the ending isn't predictable and you do keep turning the pages to find out what will happen next. By that standard it was good, and I would likely recommend it to a friend.

The title of the book comes from a bet that Nick Hastings makes with his best friend Ethan that they'll both find a bride by midnight, and within the next 30 days. Nick meets Amanda Van Patton and quickly convinces her to marry him. But, although he has the bride he doesn't have the marriage in the more traditional sense. Amanda discovers the bet Nick made and their marriage turns from one of possible happiness to avoidance and unwillingness to be together. Their relationship is actually funny and Amanda isn't the typical Harlequin female - she has a brain and a sharp wit and uses both. This book is far from great, but it provides some entertainment and is slightly better (and longer) than the average Harlequin. The book cover says it's a Harlequin Western, but it's not at all western.

LONG. That is the best way to describe this book. I started with the book and switched to the audio tapes (there were 13 I think) because it was taking to long to read. I was impressed by the breadth of the book, and it does, in fact, cover almost EVERYTHING about science, cells, the body, the galaxy, the stars, etc. The problem with this book is that it reads just like a textbook, and who wants to read a textbook from Bryson? I want his humor, his insights, his treks through other worlds, and not this. I was extremely disappointed by the entire concept of a science book and hope Bryson returns to his previous genre fast. This was a textbook, end of story. And, like some texts, several points were reiterated and repeated throughout.

Don't let the bright pink cover fool you into believing this is a lighthearted story.. it's not. The main storyline and the characters' interactions are a result of a suicide. The book is sold as a Cheers bar-like story, but there was no real similarity. I had anticipated hearing stories from within the diner and meeting up with a lot of locals and townspeople, but that really wasn't the case. The focus was less on the interactions at the diner and more on discovering if the suicide was accidental or not. I have read a few Sherryl Woods books and this one is remarkably similar to the others - the characters are so-so the romance is minimal at best, and the writing is better than a cheap Harlequin but not as involving as a real story should be. I was disappointed but would still recommend it to fans.

Tal Ben-Shahar's book, Happiness, is wonderful. It's filled with helpful information and actual 'trick's' you can use to increase your level of happiness. In the era of positive psychology it is well worth your time to read, if you haven't done so already. My expectation was that the DVD would expand upon the book and offer new and different information. Unfortunately, the DVD was a major disappointment. It is about 40 minutes long (with a 15 minute counseling session tacked on at the end); basicially, Ben-Shahar highlights 5 or so points from his book and talks about them to a small audience. His writing is far better than his speaking ability - I found him to be a really boring presenter and was glad I'd read the book first. The DVD was pointless, to be honest. It doesn't offer the same insights as the book and it doesn't come across as helpful, informative or interesting. It would have been a better idea to have him put his book on audio CD for people to listen to. Watching him and listening to him wasn't good at all.

This book, Sandition, was started by Austen and completed by "another lady" since Austen died before her story was done. Austen made it to chapter 11, and that is where "another lady" takes over. There is a definite difference in the writing; you can just tell that the remainder of the book is not true Austen. The chapters are longer, the characters are more bold and outwardly flirtatious and romantic, and the writing, while very Austen, just isn't authentic. However, the book was just as fun as Austen's many others. Who knows if this is how she meant for it to go, but it's an interesting tale nonetheless.

This was a very nice young adult book, and 'clean' in comparison to many others in this genre. The main character Isabel is, like many teens, embarrassed by her mother, anddoes everything she can to distance herself from her Cuban roots. Most of the book focuses on Isabel's relationship with her mother, and the struggles they have to agree on issues. Isabel's mother is very proud of her Cuban heritage and wants Isabel to feel the same way - which she doesn't. The family lives in Miami, but Isabel doesn't participate in anything having to do with her Cuban heritage. Isabel is a smart young woman who has a variety of friends and talents. One of her talents is art, and she spends her final summer before college teaching art at a summer camp. There, she meets Andrew, and begins a relationship with him. Unfortunately, Andrew isn't everything he seems to be, and although there is some romance, the couple never makes it to the 'big act.' I think the author did a really good job of making Isabel and her entire family likeable. The book will appeal to teen and pre-teen girls not only because of the super-cute cover, but because the story is solid and the characters are fun. The author also intermixed many Spanish words with the English text, and explained what everything meant. The only part that could have been omitted was any reference to Isabel's sister Carmen - we only 'hear'from Carmen through 2 emails, and her presence in the book was minimal and unnecessary. I was pleased with the ending and overall, feel that it was a book well worth my time and recommendation.

I was really looking forward to this book as Fuhrman has proven to be quite a talented writer with his previous efforts. And, since he was able to shed light on the Greenwich murder case after so many years, I was hopeful that this book would be just as fascinating and prove just as noteworthy. Unfortunately, this book fails on many fronts. The writing, I must say, is still quality and Fuhrman takes time to explain words and concepts in detail. However, he spends almost 3/4 of the book explaining medical terms. Instead of using his talent as an investigator to shed further light on the case, I felt as if I was reading a medical case history. The subject matter - Schiavo - also makes the book... well, less interesting than a cold case or unsolved case might have been. By the time many people actually read this book Schiavo would have been dead for close to a year and the interest in her will have faded (it already has, actually). Schiavo and her life/death is not a compelling topic for an investigative/true crime book. Fuhrman should be digging up cold cases and giving us something investigative and interesting to read, not a case that is a media fad. How about solving the Jon Benet murder for the next book? I'm pulling for Fuhrman to continue as a writer and cold case solver - his writing and investigative skills seem to be tops. But, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you have a genuine interest in the Schiavo story.

This is definitely one of the best books I have read this year (in this genre, anyway). Gilbert does a wonderful job of exploring the complexities of the human mind/brain, especially as it relates to imagination and decision-making. He points out a variety of `flaws' that affect our decision-making processes and offers his solution to our problem in the final chapter of the book. The book definitely got me thinking and made me laugh quite a lot - the author infuses quite a bit of humor into the book, which kept it from being too `preachy' or overly intellectual. I think the writing style - accessible, funny, and engaging - makes the book much more appealing. He uses a lot of real-world examples to make his points, and even manages to trick the reader a few times as well. I found myself really engaged by the material in the book, and looked forward to reading it each time. I wouldn't call this book or his ideas `pop psychology,' but the book will definitely appeal to those who are not looking for anything too challenging; Stumbling on Happiness illuminates a lot of errors in reasoning and is just a really interesting read. There were some points that I felt were flawed, or needed further explanation, so I'm hoping to join in an Amazon discussion about the book. A definite must-read if this genre is of interest to you.

I'm a Pilates enthusiast and really enjoy yoga and Pilate's fitness. This is not a Pilates workout at all. I've watched several of Leslie's walking DVDs, and this is just another of her same ol' same ol' walking, with a few new arm and leg moves thrown in. She says the word Pilates about 100 times in the first few minutes. Maybe by saying the word so often she's trying to convince us we're watching it. She actually refers to all of her moves as Pilates - keep in mind these are the same old moves from all of her DVDs - now they have somehow morphed into Pilates? Ummm... OK. Maybe if she spent less time talking and more time working up a sweat you wouldn't see these glaring errors. Anyway, this DVD is a 3 mile walk with a timer on each mile, which is actually helpful. The first mile is just a warm-up mile; the second mile picks up the pace a bit and has a few new moves - mostly arm circles and backwards stepping; and the third mile is the quickest pace and throws in some leg squats. If you're looking for Pilates this is a huge disappointment and doesn't even come close, but if you like Leslie and want a faster-paced walk than her regular stuff this might be OK to try. There is a 5-minute floor segment at the end; not long enough to be of any value on a regular basis.

A lot of books seem to be taking the approach this one does in terms of writing - completing the whole story in the form of e-mail correspondence between the main characters. While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn't use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format.

FUNNY! Pepper and Walker meet at a modern-day Renaissance Faire, complete with jousting and other medieval tournament events, and the sparks fly! A very enjoyable book with a cast of characters that were funny, realistic, and very entertaining. The setting is what made this book so great - all of the medieval terms, the fun the author was able to create with the Knight/Wench atmosphere.. It made for a very enjoyable read!

It may or may not be fair to write a review having read only the first half of this book, but...I couldn't get through the last half of the book no matter how hard I tried. I wanted to like this story, especially because Macalister has written such funny books as "Improper English" and "Men in Kilts." However, this more historical romance falls very flat. The characters barely know each other and we are barely given time to know them. Their motivations are not very clear as to why they like one another and eventually marry, and the female is the typical nave virgin. I found the book lacking in character development for sure, and in plot as well. It read like a teen book and not the adult novel it was supposed to be. Reading the first half was a bit like having a tooth extracted without a painkiller - excruciating. I will still look for Macalister books, but the more modern ones.

I've had my Sony P71 for about 2 weeks now, and couldn't be happier. I really struggled between getting the Sony and the Canon S200, but went with Sony because for only more than the Canon I got 3.2 megapixels and the 3.0 zoom I was looking for. Plus, this camera uses batteries that aren't made by Sony, so I can save money. So far the picture quality is excellent - the colors are very sharp, the pictures are in focus, and my friends and family have been seriously impressed by the quality. I've been using the LCD screen and the viewfinder (the LCD screen is much more accurate), and my batteries don't drain fast; the battery life has amazed me, especially based on what I read about digital cameras and batteries. The computer/USB hookup was easy on my Windows 98 system. I haven't used the movie mode yet, but am really looking forward to movies that can be 30 minutes long with a larger memory stick. This is my first digi cam and I am definitely impressed and looking forward to taking my Sony on holiday very soon!

This was a serious chick-lit book and, unlike Carrie Pilby (by this same author), not very fun to read. The subject covered here is widowhood; Gert, a 29 year old, loses her husband Marc in a car crash and has to begin dating again in NYC. There is tremendous focus on Gert and her status as a widow - in fact, this could easy be a self-help book/guidance book for widows themselves. Unless you are particularly engaged by this author or this sad subject matter I would advise skipping the book. Because, in addition to being a sad subject (and the author makes it sad), Gert has 2 'friends' who aren't very friendly at all. Her friends, Ericka and Hallie, are so opposite to Gert in terms of kindness and authenticity, that you marvel at why Gert would even hang out with them. The friendship between the 3 girls was another facet of the book that seemed out of place and unbelievable. Also, when Gert decides to date again, she meets Tom, a train conductor, on her first night out - it seems impossible to meet 'the one' so quickly, but she remains with Tom throughout the book. I'm a bit perplexed by this book - what exactly is this author intending us to get from her writing? The book is far more serious than most chick-lit out there and not many women in the 20something age range will find it easy to identify with Gert. I would steer clear of this one unless you have a reason for reading it.

Despite the beautiful cover and engaging title, this book isn't romantic. At first, I thought the writer was a female, and I was pleased to find that a male did such a good job writing from the female perspective. The book is about failing romances. A wedding photographer - Laurie - lets us into her life and we follow her as she captures photos not only of weddings, but also of people who have broken up, divorcees, widowers, stalkers, etc. The book was about love and the many forms it can take - from syrupy to obsessive. The story also includes chapters about Laurie's own parents and their dysfunctional love story. Those chapters were quite disturbing at times, as were some of the speeches her photography subjects gave. I think the disturbing nature of the scenes is because a lot of what was happening in this book happens to people regularly; they were feelings you could easily identify with. I did find the writing slightly `choppy' - the sentences were rather short and non descriptive.. the book was a `state it like it is' type of writing style and reflected the main character and her harshness. Laurie isn't all that likeable at first, but towards the end I was hoping she would find her own happiness too. She was well-written and very complex. This book was hard to stick with, but worth it if you keep going and can appreciate some of the layers in the story.

Gilda Joyce, a brainiac 14-year old, fancies herself a psychic investigator and author. In order to develop her talents, Gilda dresses herself in elaborate disguises and spies on people in her neighborhood. When an opportunity arises to visit San Francisco over the summer, Gilda concocts a plan to get to San Francisco and stay with her mysterious uncle and cousin, Lester and Juliet Splinter. The Splinters live in an old Victorian home that is haunted by the ghost of Melanie, a distant relative of Gilda's, and an aunt to Juliet. Although Juliet and Gilda have a contentious relationship, they manage to become friends by the end of the book. The mansion provides ample opportunity for Gilda to use her investigative abilities, and she finds herself knee-deep in a mystery that is actually quite frightening on occasion. The ghost of Melanie haunts the mansion and its adjoining tower during the wee hours of the night, and somehow Gilda comes to the conclusion that her uncle Lester Splinter is responsible for Melanie's death. Gilda bothers her uncle Lester with a multitude of questions, and even goes so far as to disguise herself and sneak into his place of business; she rummages through his office and desk, and is actually quite an irresponsible houseguest. The book is cute, but there are definitely problems, particularly with Gilda's character. Basically, in order to read the book and enjoy it, you need to suspend reality quite a bit. I mean, seriously, could a 14 year old girl come up with such a great disguise that her 40 year old uncle isn't able to determine that she isn't really a wealthy widow? Would this same girl be allowed to run amuck in her relatives' home and not suffer consequences? Would she also be able to outright accuse her uncle of murder and being with the Mafia? No. The situations Gilda finds herself in are all preposterous and unbelievable. While some of the situations make for a fun read, it's mostly unbelievable and absurd. The writing is also significantly above the reading/comprehension level of its audience, so this book, although seemingly cute, is a risky purchase. It seems best suited for girls who are really smart, or those interested in the paranormal.

Take Shayne's book Thicker Than Water and swap out the characters with Beth and Josh from Colder Than Ice, and you have the same book. What I didn't know was that Colder Than Ice is a continuation of Thicker Than Water and brings back Beth Slocum, her daughter Dawn, and the religious zealot, Mordecai. The story was like reading Thicker Than Water all over again, except with less interesting characters. Basically, after shooting Mordecai last time, Beth has been relocated to a small town where - (surprise!) - Mordecai finds her and her lover, Joshua Kendall. The characters were dull, the story was flat, the romance was forced, and the book was uninteresting at best. These characters, and the story itself, didn't need to be revisited. Not recommended.

I missed this show on PBS, so I had to wait for this DVD release. The show is broken up into 3 distinct parts, each 60 minutes in length. The first part explains how the human species evolved, and why we charted one course of evolution as opposed to another. The focus is on anthropology, evolutionary anthropology, and archaeology. The second part focuses on the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives, chimps. And the final part was about the brain and how brain imaging can provide clues about our thought processes and language. The show, combined as a whole, was about what makes us uniquely human (or not); we are actually very similar to other animals. Alan Alda is the host and narrator - he was just average as a host; he's extremely old, not very knowledgeable about the subject and looked tired the whole time. If you have ever read or watched Guns, Germs and Steel by Diamond (and enjoyed it), then this is similar and would likely be of interest to you. The good thing is that because the episodes are in 60 minute segments you can pick and choose what part you do/don't want to watch. I enjoy these educational programs and would rate this one as very watchable and interesting.

Amidst all these positive reviews here is a negative one. Unfortunately I am beyond the return date for the camera so I'm stuck with my choice for quite some time. This is my very first Canon camera (prior digi cams were a Kodak and Sony), and I based my purchase on all of the positive Amazon reviews and the generally positive reviews I found on the Internet for Canon cameras. I even tested the camera for several weeks, but ... I have discovered it's not so great. The small size is wonderful and it can definitely fit in your pocket, purse, etc. very easily. The positives are in all the reviews. The negatives are not. Such as ... red-eye is in every single picture of people and pets; it is a real problem despite the red-eye reduction feature. Second, and the most important, the camera just doesn't take photos that are saturated with color - supposedly this is a good thing as the colors are accurately represented but, to my eye, the pictures are very dull, and the eventual prints are darker than I'd like. I like saturated, rich colors (even if they are a bit unnatural) and this camera is too `natural' for me. I've tried to adjust the settings - of which there are quite a few - but the dull color is something that is bothering me. Third, there is a side latch on the camera - where the USB cord is inserted that is flimsy and difficult to open each time; I ended up having to cut off the cover to the USB cord for easier access. Fourth, the low battery indicator comes on right before the battery is going out, so you're not given much notice about battery life. I read the manuals and I'm trying to like it, but the picture quality just isn't for me.

Aidan is no Jane Austen, it's as simple as that. While her characters may be the same her prose is remarkably different and definitely more modern. Basically, we get to experience the story of P&P through the eyes and thoughts of Darcy this time. The book is cute, definitely, but far more romantic and bold than the original P&P. Aidan is also much more humorous than Austen. The scenes tend to follow the book more than the movies, so people familiar with the modern movie versions might read scenes in here that they didn't see on film. The idea of reading the story from a different perspective is nice, but it really isn't necessary. Austen's books can stand alone - this book is for crazed fanatics. I too would have liked to know more of Darcy, but Austen didn't write it that way and no matter how much fan fiction is created it just doesn't have the same authenticity. It's pretend and actually takes away from the imagination we'd have to use when reading Austen's P&P.

I bought this for use in my car only, but it's not useful. I drive 1 hour to work and 1 hour back and it's dead by the time I get home. Downsides: the screen is too small to be useful, the item needs to be charged daily and for long periods of time, there is no battery-low indicator so the item just stops, very hard to turn on/off (must hold switch for a long time), has 'frozen' twice and needed to be reset. Upside: Very compact, lightweight, sound is good, the headphones are nice and the color (red) is nice. I've been looking at newer mp3 models and c'mon.. there is much better to choose from! Give this one a pass.

This book was definitely as sweet as its main topic - wedding cakes. Aside from some very very very tasty descriptions of the wedding cake frostings and fillings, this book had three main characters that were fun to read about. Lauren, Paige, and Robin are friends in Boston who all have a very different romantic life and outlook. Lauren longs for the love that got away, Robin is filled with hatred for all men after her bitter divorce, and Paige is a hopeless romantic with the perfect boyfriend. The story mainly follows Lauren as she sets her priorities straight again and learns that love and coupling is not something that can be easily predicted. I thought all three women were strong characters and the story was well-paced and interesting. Highly recommended.

This authors' first book, I Do But I Don't, was so funny and charming that I was anxious to read this second work. I was disappointed by this book, its characters, and its premise. The main character, Jane, is laid off from work, and the story could have easily been called Pity Party. Maybe because of the subject (unemployment) the writing is purposely choppy and droning?? I'm not sure, but that is the effect it seemed to have - the paragraphs are mostly discontinuous. I couldn't really care for the characters because they weren't drawn in a lighthearted matter. For instance, Todd, who is Jane's brother, is always on her case about her job hunting and resume. It made him seem as whiny and uninteresting as Jane herself. This was not a laugh out loud book, and the attempts at humor (i.e. the resumes Jane keeps sending out that are posted at each chapter end) seem like a very forced way of including humor. It just wasn't up to par with her first book, and unless you are interested in reading about an unemployed 28 year old with a bothersome brother and dysfunctional parents.. Skip it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this 'series' - Why Men Date Bitches. However, this book really didn't offer anything new. If you read the first book there is no need to read this one - the advice is the same, and the wording is just as straightforward as ever. If you have not read either of these two books I would recommend starting with the first one - it seemed stronger all around, and leaves you with a great sense of empowerment.

This was a very enjoyable book -- it was lighthearted, funny, and romantic too. The writing was quick-witted and the characters were fully developed and fun to read about. There is the main storyline, between heiress-on-the-run Lucinda, and a chauffeur, Max, and there is an equally involving sub-story between Rosemary, a nanny, and Nathaniel, a wealthy cad. The story takes place at the estate of a wealthy couple (the Coves) in Kentucky over a period of three months. The writing was repetitive at times, but only because it followed the characters' random thoughts and allowed us to see just how silly/confused they were. The plot was totally unbelievable, but the characters themselves were quite charming and made the book a worthwhile read. I thought the story started slow, but it picked up in the ssecond chapter, and was a truly a modern-day romance with freethinking, personally flawed characters. I had never read a book by this author before, but would look for more by her.

This isn't a particularly engaging book. It's not bad, but it's not great either - the book is extremely average in every respect. The characters and their motivations for doing things are not carefully crafted, the murder mystery plot wasn't that interesting, and the romance between the two main characters was weak. I kept waiting for this book to really 'take off,' but it never did. The writing remained stable, but there just wasn't enough action, suspense or romance to make this a great book. The author did her homework in terms of describing the location where the book takes place, and it appears she studied up quite a bit on mountaineering and military terms, but even those descriptions lacked feeling and that engaging quality that good writing evokes. The characters are not ones that you will remember after the book is done, and the writing just isn't strong enough to create visuals and place you alongside the characters. While reading this book, I was reminded of college professors with mundane, uninflected voices that seem to drone on and on. This book, and the writing, was very monotone.

This book is definitely HOT! In fact, it may even be too hot for some. The scenes are pretty descriptive and the two characters have a very rich imagination. The basic premise is that Eileen (a lawyer) wants one night of wild sex with a stranger before settling down into marriage with her boyfriend. Enter Shane (a telephone rep) who is her stranger not just for one night, but a week of nights. This book isn't going to win any prizes for plot development and storyline, but for what it is (a Harlequin Blaze), it's worthy of 5 stars for sure. The author manages to make the storyline flow realistically, and you don't really feel like you're reading one of those "cheesy" romance books. There is comedy and heart in this book, and a lot of heat!

This is a terrible story with terrible writing. Molly and Alec are friends first; Alec has been Molly's chauffer for about 6 months. Molly is a ghostwriter who wants to break into erotic literature, and Alec is a confused young 20something with no ambition and no usable skills. Molly and Alec hook-up sexually after exchanging just a few words. The book was terrible - the writing was drab and uninteresting, the characters were shallow and lifeless, and the `romance' was barely lukewarm - definitely not `heat.' Awful book, awful writing, a major ZERO RATING.

I heard the song Parisienne Walkways on tv and decided to check into who performed it, and it was Gary Moore. So.. I bought this CD knowing nothing about him or his music and was very pleasantly surprised. I think this is a great CD if you like jazz, blues, rock, etc. - it really has a mix of many different types of music and I could detect influences in the music from a variety of different groups, like the Scorpions, Journey, and Dire Straits. The CD has 14 tracks, and all of them are long, so it's a really good deal too.

I've had my CX7430 for over 2 years now and have enjoyed this camera thoroughly. The camera has great zoom capabilities and can get you close to the subject you want to photograph. The battery life is very decent, even when the LCD display is being used. The pictures themselves (when left on Auto mode) are super - the colors and clarity are excellent. I've received very positive feedback about the clarity of the pictures. The memory cards are inexpensive too, especially if you don't buy the Kodak brand of SD cards. The camera is preloaded for only 10 pictures and comes with a nonrechargable battery set, so investing in memory and batteries is a must. My favorite feature is the video capabilities; with my 1GB card (and the camera will accept up to a 2GB card) I can get close to 70 minutes of video, with wonderful audio. The video is recorded in .mov files and are quite impressive. The downsides? Sure, there are a few.. the camera is quite bulky in comparison to almost all other digi cams currently available - it's quite `fat' in size, and the casing is very easily scratched, even with gentle use and care; and night shots taken outside (like fireworks or holiday lights) are pretty terrible - blurry and unusable. Overall I am very impressed with the quality and features of this camera and won't be replacing it for quite some time. The 4MP are more than enough for quality photos, the video is a wonderful bonus and the ease of use is wonderful. Highly recommended.

This was a very easy-to-read book. The main character, Priya, is an Indian woman who is brought to Los Angeles through an arranged marriage. Priya met her husband, Sangay, a week before their marriage and, although she found him attractive physically, there are problems in their relationship. Sangay expects Priya to be a dutiful Hindi wife, and she is at the beck and call of her in-laws. Her in-laws are not necessarily bad people, but as Priya becomes more and more Americanized, she comes to expect to be treated as an equal by her husband and her in-laws. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen and Priya is forced to make some serious changes to her life. The book is a fairy tale, plain and simple. What happens to Priya - finding a dream job, earning hundreds of thousands, meeting with big-name celebrities, and winning over her husband and in-laws a second time was pure... fantasy. The author gave Priya an enviable set of circumstances her first time out in America and it was unbelievable. The ending was very quick as well -the author tied up loose ends with Priya and her sisters, but skimped quite a bit on details. The book was enjoyable though - it was an interesting look at Hindi culture and expectations, and Priya had some insecurities and job/friendship issues that many 20something females can identify with.

My favorite health/nutrition bars are CLIF and LUNA. My mom was the one who actually gave me one first, and I couldn't believe how wonderful they tasted. It was the product packaging that led me to the CLIF website and, eventually, this book. The book is about the founder of CLIF, Gary Erickson, and how he went from a mountain biker with no money to a mountain biker with heaps of money. The story is, at times, inspirational and it is especially interesting to read about the actual company policies and commitment to being organic and environmentally aware. These statements seem to run throughout the book and make you really believe in the goodness of the CLIF company. It almost seems too good to be true - the values that the company holds, their interest in being organic and leaving minimal impact on the earth, and supporting important causes, etc. There is a lot of focus in the book on the almost-sale of the company and the dissention that ensued between Gary and his partner. I'm sure she (the partner) would have a completely different tale to tell, but it seems that it got pretty ugly towards the end. A lot of the story is also missing; we don't get much of the background of how he came to actually make the CLIF bar - just simple references to mom's kitchen. If you're at all interested in autobiographical stories and have an interest in learning more about this company, then the book is a good, solid read. It lends insight into the dynamics of CLIF and makes you even more interested in the products - which are really terrific.

This was a mini Da Vinci Code for the teen and pre-teen set. Basically, 3 teens get letters in the mail informing them that someone has stolen a Vermeer painting and does not intend to return it until some facts about Vermeer are brought to light. Why someone intelligent and artwise would select 3 teens to solve the mystery is, well.. a mystery. The 3 kids set about trying to discover who stole a famous painting and along the way involve their teachers and make use of `clues' they stumble upon. This was an interesting book - it exposes teens to the art world and definitely uses mature words and language, without being boring. It was very much like a Da Vinci Code for children. But, the da Vinci Code made sense, and the `clues' in this book are so unrealistic and so far-fetched and convoluted that I lost track quite often. It got a bit crazy after a bit, particularly when the kids determined that the number 12 had significance for like 50 different reasons. I would recommend it, but, overall, didn't find the story believable.

Okay, so Sparks' other books haven't exactly been literary masterpieces either, but at least they pulled at your heartstrings and made you feel so sort of emotional connection to the characters. Not so in this book. This qualifies as one of the worst books of the year imo, and it was really hard to care about any of these characters or the storyline in general. The book was extremely predictable, unemotional, and simple (in terms of writing, plot, character development, etc.). It is a real waste of time, but based on Sparks' name alone this book will unfortunately be heralded by many without more discerning tastes in reading material.

Ok, I admit I judged this book by its ultra-feminine cover, but I was very pleased to find more inside the pages than I anticipated. The book isn't very deep, but following the main character (Abby Rose) on her exploits was a lot of fun. And, mix in a light romance with a hunky detective and you have a real girly-girl mystery read. This gets 5 stars for entertainment value - it was fun to read, engaging, and just long enough to solve the mystery well and not leave any loose ends. I look forward to the next one!

This second in the Yellow Rose mystery series was just as pleasurable as the first. Once again, Abby Rose, now a private adoption PI is involved with murder and mayhem. The characters were fun to get to know, although the craziness of two sisters - Courtney and Roxanne - was a bit over the top at times. The mystery is involving, and just long enough to hold your attention. I particularly enjoyed the trip Abby took to Jamaica to further research the case - getting Abby to another location with locals really added to the story. If you haven't read the first in the series, I would recommend that; although the author goes over the highlights from her first book the characters are drawn from the first book mainly, and just expanded upon here. I look forward to the next book.. fun and light series.

This book was fairly useful, but I felt that a lot of the information was geared to high-end professionals and not your average person just interviewing for a job. For instance, the chapter on salary negotiation was a bit over the top. Stein tells you to go in and bargain for an incredibly high salary and then just stand up and shake hands when the interviewer comes to a number you like. It was a prety useless chapter considering most people won't be making the 80,000-120,000 salaries she kept mentioning. The other problem I had was with one of the early statements in the book - Stein says &quot;don't memorize,&quot; and yet at the end of the book we are supposed to know over 20-40 of these &quot;Q Statements.&quot; I liked the idea of Q statements and backing up your answers with solid examples, but the rest of this book was just common sense, like how to dress and research the company beforehand. I can see now why she might have had the trouble she cites publishing it. There is nothing here you can't find in another book. It's ok, not great.

*Spoiler in this review* This book is about a group of 5 girlfriends who gather for the wedding of one of their own (Emma). The bridegroom isn't particularly liked by the friends so, when he turns up dead, the mystery is.. which girlfriend did him in? The "Pact" is a vow these 5 friends made years ago to 'do away with' any boyfriends they didn't approve of. This was a very light mystery.. very light. The characters were not involving, the narrator (Rachel) was the most interesting of the 5, and even she didn't have an interesting character. I just wasn't moved by this book at all.. but was happy it was a chick-lit book that involved more than just romance, breaks-ups, etc. There was actually very little romance in this book - it was mainly a light whodunit. The end wasn't particularly satifying either. It actually would have made for a better book if someone in the pact had done the murder. This is marginally recommended - there is nothing really wrong with the book, but nothing spectacular about it either. Very forgettable.

WOW! 5 STARS! This is the most romantic book I've ever read!!! The Day We Met is, to me, what romance is all about - two people meet, they have an instant connection, and they see the romance through to the end with a minimal amount of difficulty. The story of Maggie O'Brien, a divorced mother of two, and Conor Riley, a cop with a past, is riveting! They are passionate for one another, romantic with one another, and put their own happiness above what others think. Although they face some family opposition (particularly from Maggie`s daughter, Nicole), the story is really a true romance - Maggie and Conor get to know one another more and more and the more they learn, the deeper in love they fall. In fact, Bretton does a great job of introducing us to Nicole and Charlie (Maggie`s kids) and showing us how real life and its angst didn`t stand in the way of this couple. `The Day We Met' is a perfect romance, and is not riddled with love scenes and gratuitous sex in order to be romantic (although the chemistry is very evident!). The best part about this story was that it was perfect - in addition to very involving writing, the characters did not have to suffer enormous tragedies or be separated from one another and put through `tests' to find their way back to each other. There were no games between the couple - it was just romantic!

This book is wonderful. If you are dealing with a family member who has a mental illness (particularly severe schizophrenia), you will find answers and helpful advice throughout this book. The first few chapters provide insight into the illness and it's especially readable because Woolis doesn't get overly medical. She provides enough information for you to understand about the illness and why your relative may have it. The book is chock-full of useful advice, and we have tried many of her suggestions (with success) already. She walks you through ways to talk to your family member during `episodes,` how to get them to perform basic tasks, how to ask them to take meds, and so on. There is advice for almost every situation. And, the best part is that Woolis treats the illness with respect, and encourages us to do the same throughout the entire book. I really felt that her advice is from the heart, and meant to help us. There is a section on how we need to focus on ourselves too, and that was particularly helpful. The book is very user-friendly, and can be read cover to cover or in sections. Many of the sections answer the questions most family members have, and offer concrete and realistic ways in which to handle the bizarre requests and behaviors that accompany mental illness. Everyone in our family has a copy that gets a lot of use. Highly recommended.

I bought this CD about 2 years ago, when I was travelling overseas (it was released a while back in Japan). In any case, I think this CD deserves 10 stars because it is so amazing! There isn't a bad track on this CD, and the songs are great for listening to no matter what mood you may be in. 'Cab Driver' is definitely one of my faves, as is 'Hold On To Me,' but there are some great up-tempo tunes on the CD as well. I have always enjoyed listening to Daryl Hall's voice, and thought this CD was just as good, if not better, than his previous solo, Soul Alone. The songs show a lot of growth and are just wonderful to listen to. This is definitely his best solo album, and I hope there are more to follow. If you're a fan, you will not be disappointed, and will likely spend lots of hours hitting the replay button. Enjoy!

I was surprised to see results after just one use. You have to use the 56 pack 2x a day and can do the upper/lower set of teeth together or at different times. The strips are coated with a clear gel that is whitening the teeth. The strip for the bottom set of teeth is very small and only covers about 5-6 teeth, but the upper strip offers better coverage. My teeth were white already, so now they are really white. I gave a few strips to my mom who has coffee stained teeth and they worked for her after only 3-4 uses. Good results. Pleased with the product.

I've read better and I've read worse but, overall, I'd recommend this book for it's light reading, spots of humor, and smidge of romance. Basically, 3 friends in the publishing industry set out to humiliate a man who has been destroying their personal lives and careers. However, their stunt goes awry when the man ends up dead and the 3 women are suspects. The mystery of `who done it' kept me reading, but the conclusion to the mystery wasn't really satisfying. I also wish the author had explored the romances a bit more; there was a lot of chemistry between a few characters in the book but it wasn't a primary storyline. I would read a Stephanie Bond book again though and hope for a little more fun.

This is a wonderful resource for librarians who work with large Latino populations. It covers programming for adults, teens, and children, provides helpful online and book resources, and contains an extensive bibliography and appendix. The appendix provides sample library forms, and commonly used library/computer phrases. There is also a chapter or two on communicating with Latino populations, and understanding more about their culture and knowledge (or lack thereof) of library services. The book desperately needs an update though - not only because it depends heavily on Internet resources, but also because this is a constantly changing and emerging customer base. The book will be especially helpful for smaller libraries/librarians because of the tips it offers to start your programming and collection. It's not easily read - you really need to absorb a lot of the information and understand it before moving on - but that's why it's a great resource and one that you'll likely refer back to as well. Highly recommended. Author/publisher -please update this text!!

I was impressed by this book and the mystery overall. The character of Lacey Smithsonian was fun and engaging, and the cast of characters - both in the newsroom and in the salons - were great additions. I would have liked a bit more romance, but that's ok.. it's a mystery first and foremost. The location is cool too - Washington DC can keep you interested for some time. It's a very witty book with a nice mystery and I look forward to the next few books.

There is nothing wrong with the quality of writing in this book - in terms of romance authors, Bretton is actually among the best at being literate and having a story to tell. This story is about family and the ties that do (or do not) bind them; two sisters who are living on different continents, come together when their mother is injured in a terrible accident. The sisters, both of whom are not particularly close to the their mother (or each other, it seems) are not thrilled to be back home again, but come back anyway. Catherine and Joely (the sisters) are both involved in romantic relationships of some sort, and are having a hard time being truly in love, mainly because of their rotten childhood. It sounds like a good story, and it starts out that way... BUT... it doesn't really live up to expectation. The girls' mother, Mimi, never says a word throughout the entire book, and she is supposedly the main problem both of these girls face, and the relationships that the girls have with their boyfriends is really convoluted and a lot is left unexplained. For instance, we don't even discover how Joely knows her current boyfriend for several chapters - they seemed so distant that I thought Joely was a nanny and not a girlfriend. Basically, there is no romance in this story and I suppose I was expecting some of that. I wouldn't recommend this book.

I was very impressed when I purchased this deck. Along with the cards, there is a comprehensive book that details what each of the cards means, and delves into the history of the tarot and why it is associated with Egypt. There are many different types of spreads shown. The deck is also heavily influenced by astrology - many of the cards have the symbols associated with each zodiac sign on the card. The cards are truly beautiful, and you won't be disappointed if you enjoy Egyptian history/culture -the detail that was taken with each card is really amazing. The colors are vibrant greens, reds, blues, yellows, and purples, and each time you view the cards your eye catches some new detail. I took the time to read the book before using the cards and it made my readings much more meaningful. Enjoy!

I've had this bed for over one year now. It has maintained it's shape and the dog still loves it. Very easy to pick up and cart about - it's light and portable. The downside is that the fluff from the bed goes all over the place; it sheds really badly. The shedding from the bed is so bad that I can really only use one side of the mattress pad/bottom cushion. The bottom cushion is reversible - fabric on one side and fluff on the other - but because the bed sheds so much both sides end up looking fluffy. The bed is ok, but I would look for a sale and not pay too much for it.

I've read better and I've read worse. This book is the first of a triology about Last Chance Inc., a group of specialists who meet up to solve some of the country's most dangerous problems - like bombings, snipers, murders, etc. In this first book, Madison and Gabriel are the main characters; Madison is a criminal profiler and Gabriel (Gabe) is a member of the Last Chance team who doesn't relish the thought of working alongside a profiler. Madison, Gabe, and the rest of the assembled team have the task of finding out who is responsible for a series of murders that are linked to the president and his relations with China. Of course, being a romantic suspense, Madison and Gabe fall in love along the way. There were not any `exciting twists' or any comedic moments either - this was a straight forward book with a fairly good plot and some action too. I would recommend it, but only if you like action to take a front seat to romance.

While reading his concise contract for America, I felt as though I was being spoken to my a very knowledgable professor. Gingrich presents his ideas in an easy-to-read and like myself. His perceived threats to America in the 21st Century include: environmental, China/India, terrorism, lagging behind technologically, and more. I particularly liked his ideas regarding welfare and social service, and really enjoyed that he spoke about God and the influence of God on the Constitution and the founding of America. He may or may not be right, but I enjoyed reading about it anyway. Some of the ideas he presented didn't really have merit in my opinion, like paying students to study math/science. And, many of his ideas involved too much reliance upon technology and processing things via computer.. Computers make mistakes too, but he presents the ideas of computerized elections, etc. as if that will solve problems. Overall, an enjoyable book.

The positive thing about this book is that the writer lives in the country of which she is writing - Afghanistan. She is a hairdresser who went over to Afghanistan on a social mission and decided to make her life there. The Kabul Beauty School is the name of the school that was funded to help women in Afghanistan learn a trade to support themselves. The story is good because you learn a lot about the cultural values that are in place there, and the vast differences between how men and women are treated. The bad parts about the book (and there are actually a few things) are: the writer herself (Debbie) isn't a particularly likeable woman, and she is definitely not a great writer. The book is written rather amateurishly, and I didn't think Debbie was at all likeable; in fact, she struck me as being rather trashy and naive. She had a tough life in America, but instead of using Afghanistan to create a better life for herself, she actually worsens her situation a bit (I won't spoil how). She just doesn't come across as very smart, and that made her a pathetic narrator. So, the book was 50/50 for me; 50 likeable because of the insight into Afghanistan, and 50 trash because of the narrator herself.

If only I had Cassia Carr's problem; she unknowingly contributes $5 to an office lottery pool and winds up one week later with 22 million dollars! WOW! I'd be spending that money on clothes, travel, homes, gifts, etc., but Cassia - being the good little 30something Christian virgin that she is - pouts over her good fortune and laments her win. Instead of being delighted by this opportunity to change lives, she struggles over how to 'unload' the millions. Her whining becomes aggravating after a while, and her friends and family have to not only tolerate her weirdness over the money, but all the scriptures she quotes on a continuous basis. Luckily, the author of this book placed the scriptures in italics, so they are easy to avoid and read right over. The book was definitely for Christian-lit fans, and also chick-lit fans, but it didn't have the same 'catch' that non-religious chick-lit books do. The biggest thing that is missing is romance - although Cassia strikes up relationships with men in the book she doesn't go all the way, and it gets pretty dreary and uninteresting reading about her life. This book was a struggle to get through and I'd only recommend it if you're really into this author or genre. Us non-Christian chick-lit lovers should stick to mainstream chick-lit with lots more action.

This book started out with a funny and promising plotline, but petered out rather soon. By the middle of the book I had given up on all of the characters and the book itself. There wasn't any romance (at all) within the first half of the book, and the chemistry was lacking between the main characters (John and Jane) throughout. Their involvement with one another was unbelievable, and the circumstances they often found themselves in were extremely contrived. This was a disappointing book. I guess if you're a fan of the author you might be pleased, but only if you can tolerate a rather blah story.

This book wasn't wonderful - it was entertaining and even fun at times, but the storyline was pretty unbelievable and the main character, Natalie, was as smart as a doorknob. From a writing standpoint, I can already see the problem with this author - she does not create smart and sophisticated 20something women, and she leaves the storylines hanging - this was very evident in While in Rome and again in Little White Lies. In Little White Lies, Natalie Raglan `takes over' the persona of Cressida Langton but the `takeover' isn't well crafted - instead of really having a good time with the storyline (ie having Natalie mistaken for Cressida in public), we are cheated and left wondering what Leonora said to the Rutherford family when Natalie was discovered. This was a crucial point in the story and the author just glides over it and moves to the next chapter - perhaps her writing skills are not strong enough to actually write out what would have happened? We hear so much about Leonora, Leonora is the only person who can expose Natalie, and we don't even get to hear Leonora speak! It was ridiculous. My major point of discontent with this book (and her previous one) is just an overall lack of character and story development. The book is fun, sure, and quick to read, but it's lacking quality and is the reason this writer won't ever be among the best in this genre.

This is the first book in the new line of Diagnosis Murder mysteries; it isn't as good as the second and third books are, but gives a great introduction to the series and the characters. If you watched the show it is easy to imagine each of the characters coming to life and to see the workings of Dr. Sloan as he solves yet another case. The humor from the series is here, as is the same light mystery. I read the first three books out of order and was very impressed by the second and third books too. I think this series has potential and hope to read many more.

With over 840 reviews, what is left to say? The product works well enough, although I have experienced blue lines running across the screen during the music transfer process. This has happened a few times, but I was able to reset the Sansa with no loss of data. I've owned this item for about 7 months and use it 2x a week maximum. If I had to do it again, I would not buy the item - it has proven to be too big for jogging/walking, and once you add a protector case (which is a must), it gets quite bulky. I have not used the video, picture, or voice features at all, I barely need 2GB, and in the sun the screen is useless. My advice: just be very careful to not buy more than what you really need in an MP3 - save as much as you can so you can upgrade more often. The product is easy to operate though and has held up, so I'd recommend it to people who are considering it.

This is my first tarot deck, and it is very helpful. The meanings are printed right on the cards. As a beginner, I would have liked this deck to have included better instructions or a small booklet about how to read tarot. It is a good learning tool though; detailed pictures, sufficient wording to understand each cards' meaning, and the cards are large and yet easy to handle (although they seem to buckle pretty easily). I would definitely recommend this deck to a beginner.

This book captured the complex creature known as man. The author does a tremendous job of involving us in the life of Tom, his girlfriend Sara, and his mistress, George. Through his relationship with these two women, and also the wonderful supporting characters, we see Tom at his best (and his worst). Tom is a ghostwriter with a vivid imagination, and we're treated to some of his musings through some hilarious scenes - the book is witty, at times laugh out loud funny, and yet the writing still maintains class and even a `message' about human nature. In fact, some of the best portions of the book are the introductions to each chapter, which are written by "God." I'm very pleased to have found this book and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality reading material with an edge.

Another satisfying mystery in the Diagnosis Murder series. I have enjoyed them all so far, but this was definitely the weakest mystery of the bunch. There are 3 mysteries going on simultaneously, but the `thread' between them all is easy to identify. The reason this book was lacking, in my opinion, is because 2 of the people Mark was helping this time were actually alive; the books work better with a murder where Mark is actively solving something. Still, it was a light and quick read and parallels the show nicely.

I like this deck, even though it does try too hard to be all things to all people. The cards are loaded with symbolism - I Ching, Yes/No symbols, traditional tarot figures, gemstones, the alphabet, Runes, etc. You can use the cards for simple yes/no questions, to spell out answers to questions, and to &quot;play games&quot; (as the companion book says). The images are computer generated but are still very appealing, and many of them are quite vibrant (with bright hues of pink and blue). The drawback I found was that many of the cards have the same meanings written underneath; I don't think the creator of the deck took too much time to give the deeper meanings that are usually associated with each card. The pluses with this deck are its diversity and the opportunity to try new types of readings; the companion book, which is very comprehensive and informative; and the website that accompanies the deck. I would recommend that you look at some images of the deck carefully before purchasing and only buy this deck if you like to mix symbolism, and don't mind a very nontraditional deck.
