I knew from history class that Mary Wollstonecraft was an early feminist and the mother of Mary Shelley, the author of "Frankenstein". I had no idea what an incredibly eventful and meaningful life she led until I read this book. Wollstonecraft's childhood was very edgy and anxiety-producing, with an alcoholic and abusive father, and a mother whose own perversity played to his abuse. The reader gets the impression that the mother has to participate in the disfunction to keep a roof over her head. Her loving paternal grandfather, who knew how unreliable his son was, left a will taking care of both his grandaughters and grandson. Wollstonecraft's brother who had been a co-sufferer with his two sisters in the traumatic setting of their childhood, betrayed them by challenging the will in court. He succeeded in overturing the non-traditional will so Wollstonecraft and her sister were left indigent in spite of her grandfather's wishes. In that era, a woman's only option for supporting herself was marriage, witness the desperation of Wollstonecraft's mother. A freethinker, Wollstonecraft continued to walk a tightrope all through life, getting involved sexually with several intellectual leading lights of her age (with results ranging from embarrassing and frustrating to disasterous, just like nowadays), bearing a child out of wedlock, and always lacking in any kind of security in spite of her own prominence in the intellectual arena. The effects of her individualism even resulted in imprisonment in the infamous asylum "Bedlam". This is the amazingly written story of a very interesting woman from history. If you read this, you will definitely not be bored, and you will see what important changes feminism has brought about in a relatively short period of time thanks to people like Mary Wollstonecraft.

This is the sequel to Kin Platt's excellent mystery "Sinbad and Me". All the great characters are back: adventurous teenager Steve, his heroic bulldog Sinbad, girlfriend Minerva, her suspicious dad the Sheriff, Herk, all investigating goings on involving witches, mandrake root, and a deadly bracelet. What a great book! If you are ten on up, you'll love it! If you are an old person, you will still love it!

I am not a great movie or television fan, and I was especially reluctant to watch a movie in the "romantic comedy" category. I was so surprised at this movie! It is the loving portrait of an Italian family and community in New York City. The photography is beautiful, the music is wonderful. It is full of symbolism, foreshadowing, and watching it is a very deep experience! I actually watched it three times in one day. I have never felt such chemistry between two actors as there is between Cher and Nicholas Cage. This movie is in the top five best movies I've ever seen.

When I was in Junior High I found Jesse Stuart's book "Hie to the Hunters" in the school library. It remains one of the best books I have ever read. Stuart was at the same time a tough man's man and a sensitive poet. His love of the natural beauty of Kentucky and his people shines through in all his writing, as does his toughness, hard work and perseverance. He was born in the hill country of Kentucky to a father who was not literate and a mother who had only completed a few years of grade school, yet he and his brothers and sisters learned the value of education and became school teachers. "The Thread That Runs So True" is the story of his career in education, beginning when he was a 17-year-old teaching a rural one-room school in the 1920s, through stints as a principal and superintendent of schools, and finally as a farmer, author, and lecturer. "The Thread That Runs So True", written in 1949, remains probably his best-known book, but parts of it are almost too painful to read. Stuart's first year of teaching was at a country school where his older sister had been badly beaten up and driven from the school by a tough male student. Stuart wrote poignantly of the beautiful and the ugly in this book, and it is very worthwhile reading.

In "Fatal Romance" Lisa Pulitzer presented both Nancy and Jeremy Akers as strange people, but in attempting to create a fair and balanced picture of both spouses, missed delving into the obvious personality disorder which led to Jeremy shooting Nancy to death in front of two of their children. While it is refreshing that Nancy was not presented as a saint, but as a creative person who could also be pretentious and snobbish, the author seemed reluctant to admit that Nancy suffered mental if not physical abuse for years. Jeremy, who had the education and potential as an attorney to support his family, refused to do so, only paying for housing and refusing to pay the family's bills. He demanded that Nancy pay the household expenses, yet frustratingly refused to let her work outside the home. He spent huge amounts of money on trips, clothing, and sports equipment for himself, while Nancy stayed home with the three children, the phone constantly ringing from collection agencies calling and stacks of past-due bills coming daily in the mail. Nancy was an unsympathetic victim who possessed a sense of entitlement, insisting that her children go to expensive private schools, and only dressing in Laura Ashley dresses and undergarments from Victoria's Secret. It was clear that Jeremy, who presented himself to other women as powerful, successful, and charismatic, had affairs, and the Jeremy that only Nancy knew was spinning out of control: he became a packrat and cheapskate who picked through neighbors' garbage and filled the house with stacks of old newspapers and other junk, making it impossible for Nancy to keep a decent house. When company came over Jeremy relished blaming Nancy for being a bad housekeeper. Jeremy, who had been a marine, was big on physical fitness and discipline, and treated Nancy, who he forced into the role of a harried, overweight housewife, with complete contempt. He loved to insult her in front of others. Nancy made some feeble attempts to negotiate change in her marriage, but Jeremy, using the classic defense mechanisms of the narcissist, always managed to maintain the upper hand. After years in this miserable situation, Nancy met a younger man online, an uneducated truck driver, who viewed Nancy as sophisticated and successful due to her wealthy background and modest success as a romance writer. Everyone involved seemed determined to ignore the warning signs of Jeremy's instability. Even Nancy, who had lived with Jeremy for twenty years, failed to realize that the outward signs of eccentricity displayed by her husband were only the tip of the iceburg: his distorted pride and arrogance had grown into a malignancy which would not allow him to ever accept losing, especially to a man he considered far below him, and Nancy, a mere woman he had devalued for years. While Pulitzer provided a lot of detail about the lives of this troubled couple, Ann Rule would have done a better job with this story, which lacked psychological depth and fell flat. It would have been easy to give this story the direction and drive it needed to be a really excellent book. It was clear from Jeremy's actions that he suffered severe psychological disorders for years, yet the author did not make clear the most important element of the story: the progression of Jeremy's psychological state from the pride and self-discipline of his youth, the worsening narcissistic personality disorder during the course of his marriage, finally culminating in murder and suicide when he could not keep Nancy under his thumb and "win". If the book had emphasized the progression of Jeremy's personality disorders, and made it clear that Jeremy and Nancy were not simply equally strange, disfunctional people, it would have given the story more direction and urgency. As written, the book generated little outrage against the murderer and not much sympathy for the victim.

I first read this book at about age 12. That period of my life was the height of my unrequited wanderlust and fixation with man's best friend, so I was delighted at finding this journal written by a guy who put a camper top on his pickup, took his dog, and drove around the United States. It didn't even bother me that the narrator of this adventure was an "old guy". He shared my feeling about what it is like to get goosebumps when the wild geese fly overhead in the fall and the air is chill. You want to grab a sleeping bag, some grub, and hit the road. At that time, I was just like the young boy in the book who wanted to stow away in Steinbeck's camper. It would be a few years before I saw the movies "Of Mice and Men" and "The Grapes of Wrath", which led me to reading his novels and really finding out who John Steinbeck was and what he was about. In "Travels With Charley" the reader doesn't feel that gut wrenching sympathy for his fellow man which is such a big part of Steinbeck's fiction. In this book Steinbeck is kind of a grumpy old man, like Andy Rooney. Now that I'm getting kind of old myself, I find myself experiencing the changes in the world Steinbeck was discovering when he wrote this book. When he writes about meeting a shiney young submarine officer, you get the willies along with Steinbeck about the nuclear sharks deep under the sea, manned by the very young, protecting us, yet at the same time menacing. The first time I read his description of the waitress in the diner in Maine, so full of negativity that she would only think a big tipper was crazy, I had never met that kind of person before. Since then I have worked with many just like her. My favorite part was when Steinbeck camped out with the potato harvesters in Maine. Also of note are his comentary about ubiquitous "top 40" songs on the radio, last generation's castoffs as today's antiques, and sadness as charmless but comfy mobile homes replace the old family place. Steinbeck got road-weary halfway through the book, his dog got sick, and everything seemed wrong. He witnessed the terrible discrimination and trouble of integration of the early '60s. The badlands and the South creeped him out, and he couldn't wait to get back home. Isn't that just the way a real trip works?

It seems to be fashionable, in this politically correct time, to find fault with Rudyard Kipling. But Kipling was a great writer with big ideas and a big heart. He wrote "Puck of Pook's Hill" and "Rewards and Fairies" to share his love of his mother country with young readers. These books are a great introduction to English history. I find it hard to imagine a reader not falling in love with the land and people of this great country after reading "Puck of Pook's Hill". The curious reader will seek out more information on what happened during their favorite characters' times, possibly leading to a lifelong love of history and the inclination to explore the world through reading.

When he was six, my little brother got this book for Christmas. Scratch and sniff was relatively new, and we were amazed at the lovely fragrances of orange, cocoa, and apple pie hidden inside this book! We both hated the pine, like another reader. I have read that scent is the most evocative sense, bringing back the past. When I found out this book was again available, I bought it for my now adult brother for Christmas. Of course he remembered it, just like me. Get this book for any youngster for a Christmas gift, I promise it will provide Holiday memories that will last a lifetime.

If you have yet to read this book, I envy you. It was the first true-crime book I ever read, and remains one of the best to this day. Read this book at night, alone in the dark, and you will be terrified. But the book is very multi-dimensional. The victims are not treated as mere props, you will truly feel for them. Rule, a mature woman and former police officer, was taken in by Bundy's charming persona. Her gradual (and very reluctant) realization that he was a serial killer make an engrossing story. The lesson is that "charm" is not necessarily a god-given personal attribute, but could be the tool of a manipulative human predator. If this aspect of "The Stranger Beside Me" is of interest to you, try reading "The Gift of Fear" by Gavin DeBecker. It contains a lot of fascinating information on identifying the tactics of manipulation.

Have you ever known somebody really, really bad, and wondered what is going on in his head? For those of us who lead a straight life, the world of drinking, drugging, stealing and lying is inexplicable. James Elroy tells us all about it with brutal honesty. His parents were the typical troubled pair, the mother a kind of seedy bar girl, the father a manipulative con. Then Elroy's mother was murdered in a dark and perverse way. He became fixated with her murder, and the mysterious bad man who did it. This is a "coming of age" tale gone really wrong. He does not work hard in school and go on to become a sqeeky clean cop who tracks down her killer. He becomes a strange dark person who tries to figure things out from the underbelly of society, the world where the crime took place. Elroy's father's strange criminal personality and shallow affect are just what I have personally observed in the father of one really bad aquaintence. He accepts his son's increasing delinquency and mental disturbance with equanimity. The way the Elroys treat their dog reflects the way the young Elroy grows up, given a very shaky roof over head and a little food, but no moral compass or consistency in life. The author is left with the memory of his mother, who, the prototype of many women, struggle to work for a living and raise their children in the midst of their own disfunction and the bad men their lifestyle exposes them to.

This is the sequel to "Snow Dog". These are my favorite books by Jim Kjelgaard. Intrepid trapper Link Stevens and his semi-wild dog Chiri are in for a big adventure when an injured ranger rides into their camp. The ranger is tough, but his arm is badly broken and he cannot complete his mission: to find a naturalist and his pilot whose plane crashed in the unexplored virgin wilderness of the Caribou Range to the north. Link sets up the ranger in his cabin and sets out to find the downed plane. Link and Chiri's home territory is sparse and hungry this year. It is early spring. After a bad winter of trapping, Link is amazed at the bounty of nature he finds as he and his dog journey north on foot. The Caribou Range is mythic and virgin territory. Link only knows of two others who earlier ventured there, and never returned. A sign of earlier visitors to the Caribou Range is a grizzly Link is forced to kill. Its body contains the remenants of an arrow fashioned from spent ammunition. Things get complicated when Link finds a human footprint. This book is filled with even more outdoor adventure, survival, and natural beauty than the first book, "Snow Dog". It is really exciting reading.

"The I-5 Killer" lacks the elements that make Ann Rule books so fascinating. Granted that Randy Woodfield is a complex criminal, and his story is interesting, but when Ann Rule wrote this book she had not yet started delving into the perpetrators' pasts and psychological makeup. Like her other early works, "Lust Killer" and "The Want-Ad Killer", Randy Woodfield's story is a better-than-average true crime offering when compared to books by lesser authors, but not nearly up to the level of Ann Rule's writing today.

"The Old Man's Boy Grows Older" is the wonderful sequel to "The Old Man and the Boy". As the author grows up and moves away from his grandfather, he remembers more of the things his grandfather taught him. Being hungry, miserable and mistreated in his first job as crew on a cargo ship brings memories of hunting for ducks and the wonderful food prepared in hunting camp. The reader can see how the grandfather started teaching Ruark to be a man, and dealing with adversity on his own taught him more. As with "The Old Man and the Boy", this book contains some really beautiful hunting and food writing. A book not to be missed by old men, boys, and anyone else who loves the outdoors.

H.V. Morton was a great travel writer. The first books I read by this author were about Italy, because I read everything I can about Italy. Morton wrote during the early 20th century, so there is a definite feeling of not just travelling, but travelling to another time. This is even more noticeable in the books about England and London. "In Search of England" takes the reader back to England of a few generations past. Morton is fascinated by the England of HIS past, and he speaks with English country folk who were old-fashioned even to his generation. There was a man who chipped flint into tools, for example. For readers like me who were fascinated by books like Rudyard Kipling's "Puck of Pook's Hill" and "Rewards and Fairies", Patricia Wright's "I am England", and the more recent "Sarum", this book will be a great source on England as it was in the last century. Very charming.

This is a scarey book. I envy those who will be reading it for the first time. It is very different, and as another reviewer observed, the reader has to decide whether to view the evil as supernatural or spiritual (kind of like The Shining). The reason I suspect the nasty things that take place in this book come from the souls of the people in the neighborhood is that they are all SO shallow, smug, judgmental, and annoying. Either Anne River Siddons creates characters who are not likable as a spiritual lesson, or she has never met any likable people. I have read all of her books and find her characters universally creepy and phoney.

This is a wonderful adventure story about a young teenage boy who ran away from his city-dwelling family and cramped apartment for the Catskill Mountains. Sam, the hero, is a very self-reliant, independent young man. He planned ahead, learning how to make a fire by striking flint aganst steel while still in the city. He resourcefully and bravely met every obstacle, providing himself with a good, cozy home in the rotted out heart of a great tree, finding food, tanning hides from deer lost by hunters for clothing, and even taming a falcon for companionship and hunting. The details in the book are very realistic. Jean Craighead George knows about edible wild plants and other details of outdoor survival, and writes about them convincingly. I love the way Sam uses his head and meets every challenge that comes his way. Only in the end of the book, when he has food, shelter, and even his needs for companionship are met, does his family re-enter the scene. He does not need rescuing from the wilderness, he has done a great job in not just surviving, but in making a real sustainable life for himself. What a great and empowering book! Sure to make anyone with a heart dream of running away and living in the wilderness.

I have seen this series around for years, and not being a big mystery reader, I have avoided it. But when I finally checked "One For the Money" out of the library, I got hooked by page one! These books are just so funny! They are also filled with adventure, and a form of romance which I can actually stomach. Stephanie is really fun. She is goofy and funny, but some of the predicaments she gets into (having to pawn everything she owns and buy a really nasty car) are pretty realistic, so the reader can relate. Her family is hilarious. Her boyfriends are sexy and exciting. Janet Evanovich is a former romance writer, but it doesn't show in this book. Coming late to this series, I got the treat of gobbling up eleven of these books in a couple months. My advice: read all of the Stephanie Plum books, but stay far, far away from the romance books by Janet Evanovich which are being re-issued due to her success as a mystery writer. They are rank.

"A Child's Garden of Verses", illustrated by Tasha Tudor, is a beautiful book. The poems are so memorable, they are just the thing to get a small child interested in the magic of language and books. Especially perfect to read aloud and share the pictures. Tasha Tudor's illustrations perfectly capture the magic of the poems. They are just joyous. A meaningful and lasting gift for the very young.

I have read several books by Wendy Corsi Stuab, and I have enjoyed them all. "Fade to Black" is no exception. The story is exciting and mysterious. The characters are well developed and appealing, and the heroine is a nice, normal, sensible woman (in spite of being a spiritual medium). One of the things I really enjoy about Staub's writing is that you really get a good idea of the setting of the story. This book is set in the real New York town of Lily Dale, a historic town that has been a center for spiritualists since Victorian times, and from the descriptions of the people, the houses, the businesses and restaurants, I feel like I have been there. Another thing I find refreshing about this author is that her books, while centered around female protaganists, are not romance stories. I emphatically agree with the reviewer "Book Maven": romantic cliches really annoy me too, and I waste a lot of time and money buying books, only to find that what looks like a thriller is really a Harlequin in disguise. I look forward to reading all of Wendy Corsi Staub's books. "In the Blink of an Eye" is a great book to curl up with on the couch on a cold evening.

"The Want Ad Killer" is one on Ann Rule's older books. She used to write for true detective magazines, and her earlier works show a no-nonsense writing style which has evolved over the years. In her more recent stories, Ann Rule delves into the past of the killer, doing her best to answer the curious reader's question: WHY? The quality that makes Ann Rule the very best true crime writer is her in-depth research and psychological insight in exploring what makes the killer tick. I feel that she did this to a greater extent in "The Want Ad Killer" than she did in her other early books "Lust Killer" and "The I-5 Killer". Harvey Carignan was always the unwanted, troublesome child. Still, I think if Ann were writing this today, there would be more in-depth character development, and that is what I miss here. I love the detail present in Rule's more recent books. If you are interested in true crime, this is worthwhile reading. Even Ann Rule's earliest books are better than 99% of the true crime writing out there today.

There are three books in the "Red" series. The first one is "Big Red". The second one is "Irish Red", about Mike, the son of Big Red. This is the third one, about Shaun, Big Red's son who is the ultimate show dog, and can't have a life outside the show ring for fear of damaging his looks. Danny, the hero of the earlier books, has hired Billy, another boy from the mountains to work in Mr. Haggin's kennels. Billy is the best person in his family. His relatives are thieves and trouble makers, and his uncle shows up Mr. Haggin's ranch looking for trouble. Even though Billy is a civilized young man, he is forced to protect the ranch against his uncle, and becomes a fugitive in the wilderness. Then the beautiful dog Shaun is lost in the wilderness, and his mate. They all join up for companionship and survival. There is a lot of coincidence in this story, which stretches credulity. It is best just to accept that this is a story and suspend judgement. In spite of this, "Outlaw Red" is definitely one of the best of Mr. Kjelgaard's books.

This book is like Canada Dry Ginger Ale- dry, crisp, and refreshing. Beverley Nichols was a very arch and witty writer! A combination of Jerome K. Jerome and May Sarton. This book is about his cats, his friends, and his garden. There are some very funny parts and some very sad parts. Some are almost too sad to read, but that is the way it usually is with excellent books like this.

The premise of this true-crime book is so interesting, I find it hard to believe what an unreadable book it turned out to be. The writing was very stiff. Carol came across as a vain and unsympathetic character. The reader only needs to be told one time what a successful, beautiful, talented, slender blonde she is. Reading over and over and over about her tasteful and expensive knick-nacks was also extremely tiresome. There was also way too much information on Dallas history. I can't help but compare this book (and its heroine) with the book "Citizen Jane", also about a woman who had to deal with being the victim of a horrible crime. Jane Alexander, the hero of "Citizen Jane" comes across as being a great person, an intelligent woman, and a real hero and fighter. Her book is really well written and engaging. Too bad she didn't help Carol Cook write this book.

There should be more than five stars for books like this one. All the reviewers who wrote about how poetic yet concrete, magical yet real this account of boyhood in the Cotswolds have said it much better than I can. It is pure magic. I wish it was 20 times as long. You might also find this book under the title "The Edge of Day". If you loved "Cider With Rosie" you might also enjoy "Lark Rise to Candleford", "The Golden Evenings of Summer" and the movie "A Christmas Story".

This book was great for me because the author wrote loving, detailed descriptions of the places she went, the food she ate, and the people she met. Her husband, who she thought was the love of her life, left her after only a year of marriage, in a nasty, hurtful way. She left San Francisco to spend time in Italy to distract herself from thinking about her marriage, and to avoid meeting her ex with his new wife in their old haunts. How many of us have fantisized about escaping to a beautiful place to lick our wounds in similar situations. Of course Laura was going to find an Italian man to help get her over her emotional hurt, but the man she settled on... I can't help thinking she could have done better. What bothers me is not that "M" was a married man with kids, it's that he was gross, and a user. She described him smoking stinky cigarettes and smelling like cigars. Yuk. He's a nasty arrogant middle-aged Parisian, not even a romantic young hunk. But the story of getting over a broken heart, and the romance of beautiful places, appeals to me greatly.

"Rewards and Fairies" is the sequel to "Puck of Pook's Hill". I am very glad it is currently in print. Sometimes it goes out of print, sad because I find it one of the best books for young people. Dan and Una, two children growing up in the English countryside, meet their old friend Puck, a long time vistor to the farm where they live. Puck has used the leaves of the magical trees, oak ash and thorn, to wipe out the children's memories of their past visits, when Puck introduced them to the ghosts of the people who lived on and loved their land before them. In this book, the children and their visitors range further afield, visiting the chalk downs and sheep country where their father grew up. There they meet an early man-god, who sacrificed his eye and his mortality to protect his people and the sheep from their enemy, the wolf. They meet a French and English smuggler who introduces them to American history. This book is just as entertaining and magical as "Puck of Pook's Hill".

Ann Rule is by far my favorite true crime author. Her stories are gripping, and she is really good at setting the mood and locale. Her books also make me think of "America's Most Wanted" or "Unsolved Mysteries" in that they perform a public service. "America's Most Wanted" strives to capture fugitives, and "Unsolved Mysteries" tries to find a resolution to the unsolved crime. What I feel Ann Rule does for the public is use her stories to make people more aware of the dangers of the manipulators, users, and abusers in our lives. Rule's description of a pathological narcissist in one of her books put me on a path that I am convinced saved me from emotional and financial disaster, if not worse. My ex was preoccupied with insurance. I have often wondered how many other women Ann Rule has motivated to leave their abusers before it was too late. "In the Name of Love" is a collection of shorter stories by Rule. The main story offers a twist on the usual pattern of the abusive male victimizing his female partner. Jerry, a wealthy if somewhat shady businessman fell in love with Susan, who seemed to be a very passive and retiring woman. Jerry is portrayed as a very informal, easygoing guy. He had a childhood friend, Steve, who he took to be just a harmless loser, so he humored him and let him be a hanger-on. He even used him a little for a loan. In Steve's mind, this made him Jerry's business partner. If Jerry was eliminated, Steve thought he would have it all. Jerry never took Steve seriously, a very big mistake. It cost Jerry his life. Steve then made a personality misjudgement very similar to Jerry's. He thought he would be able to intimidate and decieve Susan, who he mistook for a passive victim. The story is very interesting, and might make you take a second look at the people in your own life. This is not Ann Rule's best book, but it is still a stand out in the true crime genre and worth reading.

This was my favorite Rutherfurd novel. I enjoyed the characters even more than in the previous books, and there seemed to be more depth to the stories. I often find myself reading additional books to learn more about a person or event that intrigues me when I am done reading one of Rutherford's books, and after reading "The Forest" I re-read Jane Austin because of the memories stirred up by one section of the book. Of special interest in "The Forest" also are wonderful stories about how the royal forests were developed and managed, village smugglers and revenue agents, and the effects of machines and steam engines on the development of rural England. I had a lot of fun reading this book, and learned a lot too.

I find myself wanting to use words like "unbelievable" to describe the story of Pat Taylor Allanson. But when you read about the family dynamics from which she came, it is very believable after all. It only follows that she would turn out to be a screaming narcissist and histrionic who also suffered from Munchausen's, and Munchausen's-by-proxy. In the book "Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson" we learn that Scott's mother had three illegitimate children by three different men. Scott's mother finally met Scott's father, who was not a professional person and had no legitimate claims to social prominence and got him to marry her, whereupon they colluded to project the image of an upper-class lifestyle which included "afternoon tea" in the garden, staged rooms in their home, and lavish luxury vehicles they could not afford. They looked down on Lacey because she had a small sunflower tatooed on her ankle, totally incapable of realizing that THEY were the low-class family. Scott was brought up to firmly believe in the superiority of his family. Pat Taylor's family history does not just eerily echo that of Scott Peterson, it is EXACTLY THE SAME. As I read "Everything She Ever Wanted", I kept believing that the horrible thing that Pat had just done was her final crime, but she just kept causing more and more destruction to her own family and anyone foolish enough to let her get close to them. There is a kind of sad justice to the fact that, in supporting Pat to the bitter end, her parents suffered financial ruin in return for their part in creating this monster. It's no wonder Ann Rule has so many loyal fans. No other author writes true crime like she does. Her books read like very well-written novels. So many true crime books come across as third-rate journalism. She has a great ability to put the reader in the setting, and make characters come alive. She is really good at explaining the psychology that makes the "unbelievable" events and characters she writes about all too real.

This is truly a great book. The book starts in India, 100 years ago. Mary is neglected by her parents and the servants are forced to indulge her every whim. Mary is not a beautiful or healthy child, the hot humid air and the narcissism of her popular, immature mother have seen to that. When the adults around her are killed by disease, Mary is shipped off to the lonely manor house of her uncle, Archibald Craven. The grim housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, accompanies her on a cold, dark, rainy journey across the moors, and attempts to quash the child's spirit. But Mary is strong and stubborn, and begins secretly exploring her new world! And being out of doors as spring comes to England changes Mary. She begins to make friends: Martha, the servant girl from a cottage on the moors, her magical, pan-like brother Dickon, and her cousin Colin, a child even more messed up than Mary. Outdoors, she makes friends with the gruff old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff and the perky little English robin who shows her a wonderful secret garden. The gardener Ben, and Martha and Dickon's wonderful mother provide a counterpoint to Mr. Craven, Mary's parents, and the nasty houskeeper and family doctor who have caused so much damage to Mary and Colin. The children, both so traumatized by the disfunctional adults who are in charge of them, use the power of nature and exercise to regenerate their own physical and mental health. Descriptions of how the children discover the beauty of the moors and the gardens that surround Misselthwait Manor have introduced generations of children to the love of plants, animals, and the out-of-doors.

The taller sole of this shoe really gives you a workout, and adds even more bounce to your step than the regular MBT. The sneaker style does not do a lot for me, but the extra length the big sole give my legs is amazing. And they really do improve your muscle tone and posture. Wearing these I feel very vital and young, I just bounce around the mall or the walking path. I know there are a lot of gimmicks out there, and you are afraid of wasting your money, but these shoes are really money well spent. As soon as you start walking in these you will see, they are just great, and worth every penny.

"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" could be the best book I have ever read, and that's saying a lot. It is true crime. It is travel. It definitely is literature. The descriptions of Savannah's homes and characters are amazing. I absolutely loved this book. You will too. It is not to be missed.

This is such a wonderful book. It is short and easy to read, but so well written, by the late poet May Sarton. It is the story of her cat, Tom Jones. When the fur person decided it was time to settle down and find a home, he found Ms. Sarton and her partner, and became a precious part of their family. This book makes a very great gift for any cat lover. Unbelievably, it has been out of print from time to time. Thank goodness it is available both in paperback and a gift edition now.

A generation of children who think sitting on their butts and playing Nintendo is more exciting than discovering an abandoned Victorian resort filled with moldy moose heads and inhabited by a fascinating old brother and sister who drive around in an ancient car is an abomination. One young reader called Minnehaha Cheever and Pindar Payton "boring and lame" and another reviewer sneered that the book is about "happy nice people enjoying each other's company and having fun". As if that's something bad. Kids, you are missing out on a lot. I feel sorry for you. Thank goodness so many others enjoyed this wonderful book, it gives me some faith in the future. This book is really fun, and it is a great adventure. Elizabeth Enright was a wonderful author.

"Empty Promises" is a collection of short stories by Ann Rule, built around one long, book-length story. The main story is about Jami and Steve Sherer. He is a drug addict, thief, insurance defrauder, and con man who uses and abuses his wife Jami and finally murders her. The big lesson in Ann Rule's books is that people are not always as they appear on the surface, and charm is often a tool used by the dishonest to manipulate the naive. Often, as is the case in the title story "Empty Promises", it is hard to understand how an abused woman could be so compliant and stupid about staying with her abuser. One thing I know from experience is that men like Steve Sherer have practiced lying and sneaking from childhood. From the day they meet a potential girlfriend, they carefully construct an intricate web of lies, and they are very, very good at it. They always have an ex-girlfriend in the wings who they are still threatening and abusing. They always have at least one other potential or second-string girlfriend waiting in the wings to support them if the main wife or girlfriend manages to get away. They enlist friends and family members to back up their stories, and for some reason these people support them. It is hard feel too much sympathy for Jami Sherer, after all, she helped him defraud insurance companies, and was into drugs herself. The man she picked out to leave Steve for was an even worse druggie than Steve. But no matter how stupid or even complicit a woman is, no one ever deserves the brainwashing and violence the victim of a pathological narcissist goes through. I have wondered over the years how many women Ann Rule has helped get away from men who are manipulating and using them. I bet it is a lot. Thanks for this book, Ann.

I'm surprised that there are not a lot of glowing reviews on Amazon of "Birth Marks" by Sarah Dunant. It was first printed in 1992, and my edition was printed in 2005, so there has been plenty of time for readers to discover the Hannah Wolfe series by this excellent author. There are at least three Hannah Wolfe mysteries: "Birth Marks", "Fat Lands", and "Under My Skin". These are not re-runs of 1950s gumshoe detective stories, or old British ladies solving village mysteries. Hannah is like Bridget Jones, if Bridget doubled her IQ and went to work for a London detective agency. She's smart, young, single, urban, and hip. In "Birth Marks", Hannah is hired by an aging balarina to locate her missing protege. When she turns up in the Thames, dead and pregnant, Hannah feels compelled to track down her killer. This is a very exciting, literate mystery. If you read this one, you'll have to read all three books. They are really good.

"That Near and Distant Place" is the sequel to "I Am England". These books tell the story of a place in England through thousands of years in time, similar to the novel "Sarum". I liked these books more than "Sarum", however. They are shorter, sweeter, and more magical. The storyteller, a wounded WWII pilot, is the descendent in spirit of a long line of storytellers who lived in his beloved little village. He possesses a magical native memory of his place, and tells about different people who lived on the land, people related to him and each other from generation to generation. Both of these books are really magical and teach the reader about the past. If you enjoyed this book, also try reading "Puck of Pook's Hill" and "Rewards and Fairies" by Rudyard Kipling. They share a sense of the magic of the English countryside and the parade of history.

"The Curse of the Viking Grave" is the seqel to "Lost in the Barrens". Both books are great adventure stories for young people and adults. My dad is in his 80s, a lifelong outdoorsman, and he really enjoyed reading this book. As in "Lost in the Barrens", there are a lot of authentic details about survival and the history of the north, including fascinating parts about hunting methods of the Eskimos, early Viking explorers, and the "stone men" of the tundra. There are many lessons about personal strength and courage, and valuing others. This is one of my favorite books to re-read and to pass on to youngsters and anyone who likes roughing it in the out of doors.

I absolutely love the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich! I quickly read all of them and wanted more! Then I found the "Full" series, including this volume, "Full Bloom". I was really disappointed to find that this is just an average romance, not very well-written. The humor, which just flows in the Plum novels, is very strained. A better choice for Stephanie Plum fans who are waiting for the next installment might be "Bubbles in Trouble" or any of the "Bubbles" books.

When I came across this book, I hoped that I had discovered a treasure. Once in a while I will find a book of nature and introspection that takes a place among my personal classics. This definitely was not one of these jewels. Richard Bode comes across as anything but "authentic". He seems extremely smug and extremely judgemental. If you expect a soul-broadening experience, forget it. He sounds like a rich, nasty, and self-satisfied old spoiled brat and reading his book will only make you feel sour.

If you like true crime, you really must read "If You Really Loved Me". Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors, not because she writes about gory crimes, but because she delves into the psychological aspect of crime. She has written several excellent books which examine the lives of killers who abuse and victimize their own families. What is the story behind the psychological makeup that drives a human being to become a betrayer, a liar, a con man so self-involved that he could kill those closest to him? "If You Really Loved Me" is about just such a character. Ann Rule did an excellent job describing the contrast between how unattractive David Brown is, short, ugly and pockmarked, with the beauty and youth of the young women he married, then discarded in their early 20s. He was very good at finding young girls (literally girls, in their young teens) from deprived backgrounds who would be impressed with his success and money. He created a world where he was king, he provided everything. Once a girl started to mature, he could no longer hold such control over her every thought, so he had to move on to a fresh, naive victim. If you ever wondered how brainwashing could be possible, this book explains it. This story of family abuse, manipulation and murder is truly fascinating.

Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, "The Wind in the Willows" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own. That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group. It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, "The Wind in the Willows" could lead to a lifetime love of books. "The Wind in the Willows" reminds me of the Victorian humor book "Three Men in a Boat", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river. It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.

Am I supposed to like these people, or find their lives even remotely interesting? Because if so, the author has failed miserably. No No and Min Foo and Wa Wa and Poo Poo were simply the most boring, obnoxious, wastes of space ever created. If this is women's literature, I would like to opt out of womenhood.

I love a well-written thriller. Unfortunately, many thrillers are not well-written. They tend to have two-dimensional characters who are exceptionally lacking and common sense and the writing is often riddled with grammatical errors. Often they are thinly disguised romance novels. "Share No Secrets" is a really good book: the plot is very suspenseful, the characters are well fleshed-out, and the reader really feels they are in the small town of Point Pleasant, WV. Three girls grew up together in Point Pleasant, Adrienne, Julianna, and Kit. They are grown up now: Adrienne is an widowed artist with a fourteen-year-old daughter, Julianna is a burnt-out supermodel, and Kit owns a successful restaurant. Kit's mother owns a historic grand hotel with a tragic history. Kit, who loves the hotel, has commissioned Adrienne to make a painting of the hotel before her mother has the hotel demolished because of her superstitious fear of the deaths that have occurred there over the years. But Julianna has been using the empty hotel to meet a married lover. Her dead body is discovered by Adrienne in a bed in her favorite room, surrounded by scented candles. Now Adrienne, who knows too much, is being stalked by Julianna's killer. There are many suspects in the small town. Could it be Julianna's ex-husband, her sister, a jilted lover, or even her old friend Kit? "Share No Secrets" is the first book I have read by Carlene Thompson. I will definitely be reading more.

Ann Rule is my all-time favorite true crime author. The reason I like her writing so much is that she really gets inside the minds of the victim, the perpetrator, and even their families and friends. What made the victim vulnerable? What made the murderer commit such a dramatic and final act? Ann Rule draws a very sympathetic picture of 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey. Anne Marie survived a truly horrible childhood, made it through college, and had a great job in politics. She was carrying on a dallianace with Thomas Capano, a rich, successful, and married attorney. She tried to end the relationship after meeting a nice young executive whom she hoped to someday marry. But she carried scars from her childhood that kept her life from being perfect and which put Thomas Capano in a position of power over her. Reading the book, I felt like I knew Anne Marie. But Capano's need to maintain control over the several lovers he kept on the side still seems inexplicable. Though seemingly superficial and shallow, he was not a love 'em and leave them philanderer. Not able to let go, he sacrificed his marriage and his wonderful career for control over these young women. What in his background made him do this? A fascinating story, and a cautionary tale for women looking for the perfect man.

The story of Scott Scurlock has a different flavor than Ann Rule's other subjects. Scott, like the other criminals Ann Rule writes about, committed violent crimes. But you sense that the author was really attracted to Scurlock and his never-neverland way of life. Scott Scurlock led a hedonistic lifestyle, always in beautiful surroundings, dining at wonderful restaurants, honing and tanning his youthful, perfect body... Too bad he had to manufacture meth and rob banks to make it all possible. And too bad he had to involve his friends in what was destined to turn into a huge mess. One aspect of Scurlock's story I wonder about is his father, a minister. Was this a case of like father, like son? Did Scott learn to manipulate others from his father? Another interesting collection of true crime stories by my favorite author, Ann Rule.

This is a truly great movie. It is based on an equally great book. The thing to keep in mind about Gilbert's house is, his dad built it. It has a lot of symbolic value. Mr. Grape married the prettiest girl in town, and fathered the kids in the movie, but the house is not stable, and the family is not stable. The family is left to survive in the house his dad built on a careless, wrongly-built foundation. The mother hides inside the house built by the father, who hanged himself. Just like the house is being held together by the inept efforts of young Gilbert, nailing up little pieces of wood down in the basement, so is the family. The book reveals more than the movie that Gilbert's buddy, who helps with the basement, is kind of fixated with Gilbert's mom. Gilbert's buddy, as well as the town's policeman is attracted to her, the image of the prettiest girl in town going to ruin. Poor Gilbert is doing the best he can, and Johnny Depp does a great job portraying the heroic efforts of this better than average young man. DeCaprio is equally great as Depp's younger, mentally handicapped brother, who ties Gilbert to his dying home town, his job at a dying grocery store, and his crumbling house. Notice how Arnie keeps trying to climb? The water tower has a lot of symbolic value, too. This movie is almost too good to be a movie. It has very deep meaning, especially to those of us who have lived the reality of the Grape family's precarious existence. I would give this movie infinite stars.

Why are stories about a boy and his dog so heartbreaking? "Sounder" is probably the most heartbreaking of all. It is very hard to read because it has so much pain, but it is about growing up, which is seldom easy, much less so for a young black man in the ninteenth century south. This boy and his dog and family goes through so much hardship, but hardship sometimes comes with lessons that make us strong for life. This is one of the best books ever for young people, and an adult might learn a thing or two before they are through reading it too. There is a lesson in the review by the literature student whose classmate (a writing teacher nonetheless!) mocked his reaction to this book and didn't get it even after reading it for herself. There are good folks with souls in this world, and there are others. It may hurt to have a heart, but how would you like to have none? Buy lots of kleenex if you are going to read this book.

"Fire Lover" is an very exciting and well-written true crime book by Joseph Wambaugh, the author famous for writing "The Onion Field". The descriptions of fires, vehicle chases and other action sequences are so clear and thrilling you really feel like you are there. It drew me in from the very beginning, with an extremely realistic account of three simultaneous and deadly fires in Pasadena, California businesses on October 10, 1984. Clues eventually lead to arson investigator John Orr as the arsonist in these and a series of other fires. Orr, it turns out, was a legend in his own mind who used the fire investigation as the basis for a poorly written book. I was glad that Wambaugh did not neglect Orr's early life. I always want a true crime author to answer the question "why", and there was more information about Orr's background than I had expected. Fascination with fire is a big indication of psychopathology. I did a little skipping, though. Emphasis on the scenes inside the courtroom got a little tiresome. Well-written and very vivid, "Fire Lover" is by far one of the best true crime books I have ever read.

Jim Kjelgaard is a really great writer of dog stories set in the outdoors. "Big Red" is the first of three Irish Setter books. If you like "Big Red" the second book is "Irish Red" and the third one is "Outlaw Red". Danny lives with his father in a shack back in the mountains. They run a trap line and harvest wild honey for money. They are squatters on the land of a rich man, Mr. Haggin. Danny's mother died a long time ago. Danny and his father make a little money on the side by doing work for Mr. Haggin. Mr. Haggin has a beautiful Irish Setter he calls Boy. When Danny sees him, it's love at first sight. But when Danny asks Mr. Haggin how much a dog like Boy would cost, Mr. Haggin says he paid $7000 for him. Danny knows a trapper could never afford a dog like that. Mr. Haggin takes an interest in Danny. It is clear that Danny is different from his father, he has some kind of quality he inherited from his mother, tempered by the ruggedness and independence he learned from living in the wilderness. Mr. Haggin gives Danny a job taking care of Boy, who Danny calls Red. Like Danny, Red shows special quality. But he has never done for himself. He's a show dog. Mr. Haggin sends Danny to New York with Red when he's in a dog show. Then when they go back to Mr. Haggin's ranch, Danny is allowed to take Red out in the wilderness. Red learns from Danny how to be a brave and rugged dog. Red and Mr. Haggin give Danny a chance to move into the civilized world, and Danny gives Red a chance to reach his potential as a real dog in the outdoor world. An earlier reviewer made a great point that applies to all of Mr. Kjelgaard's books I have read: the dog doesn't have to be killed in his books. Most great dog stories are very sad. Examples would be "Sounder", "Where the Red Fern Grows", and "Old Yeller". I don't really like to watch most dog movies, because the dog always dies. The worst that happens to the dogs in Mr. Kjelgaard's books is a broken leg, or a bad wound that heals. No kleenex needed, no broken hearts here.

So many of my favorite books are by newspaper columnists: "Growing Up" by Russell Baker, "My Dog Skip" by Willy Morris, "The Old Man and the Boy" by Robert Ruark, and "Forever: A Novel" and "Snow in August", both by Pete Hamill. A big part of all these books is the theme of a boy growing into manhood and also a great love of the place the author grew up. Pete Hamill really loves New York, and this book, "Forever: A Novel" is the story of Manhattan. The young son of a blacksmith is forced to flee Ireland after seeing his family destroyed by a wealthy and evil landlord. In his new home in Manhattan, he is granted the gift of immortality, which is also a curse. He will live forever, but must never leave the island. He is also bound to rid the world of the descendents of his father's murderer. Obviously, this book is not going to appeal to readers who value realism. But if, like me, you love magic and the cavalcade of history, you will really enjoy this book.

Narcissism is a very nasty personality disorder which has little to do with simple selfishness. It involves emotional and sometimes physical abuse of the people involved with the narcissist. Over time, it results in the emotional devastation of the victim of the narcissist. You cannot learn to "deal" with a narcissist in a close relationship. Implying that narcissistic personality disorder is something that can be "managed" is cruel to the victim, who has no doubt already gone through hell trying every method imaginable to deal with their abuser. Victims of the narcissist need to realize they need to end the relationship, just as do victims of physical violence. I would view the statement (made in the book) that narcissism is to be "forgiven" as a joke, if I didn't know that innocent, well-meaning victims are going to attempt to follow this advice and end up even worse off. Do you really think it is best to devote YOUR LIFE to someone who proves by their actions every day that the only person they care about is themselves, and are willing to lie, cheat and steal from anyone, even their own family? Someone who stays with a narcissist plays two roles: enabler and victim. Children born to narcissistic parents end up manipulated and used. By staying with a narcissist, are you willing to sentence your children to a life of emotional abuse? There are several VERY good books for the victim of the narcissist. If you want one that is short, inexpensive, and easy to read, try "When Your Perfect Partner Goes Perfectly Wrong".

When I'm feeling stressed from a tough day at work, I watch these great old "Murder She Wrote" episodes. They are entertaining and seem warm and fuzzy in spite of the subject matter. Angela Lansbury is like a reassuring old friend. This season is recorded on much better quality dvds than the previous seasons, which gave me a lot of trouble. You can see and feel the superior quality of this set. I managed to play the whole season without a single problem, which makes me very happy.

Curran is a retired military officer. He comes across as very hard to get along with and very abrasive. He wastes no time letting the reader know what an important man he had been in the military, and that he had been offered high-paying positions upon his retirement. Much of his writing deals with his soul-searching about his life after retirement. He doesn't really seem to be that into nature, actually becoming a better person, or meeting other souls on a journey. Mostly he is into himself, and he doesn't seem to improve much between the beginning of the book and the end, when he quits hiking in Maryland. He also writes bad poetry. I really wish more Appalachian Trail hikers would write the story of their hikes. I very much enjoyed "Walking Home" by Kelly Winters. She is a very likable young woman who, like Curran, was trying to figure out where she was going next in her life, but reading her story was very fun and informative, filled with nature, people, and adventures. It is amazing that though both authors hiked the same trail, and both wrote about encountering individuals who they didn't like, Curran's book was so filled with negativity and Winters' book was so positive. I would say this book is only for those who, like me, feel compelled to read every book about the Appalachian Trail.

I love it when I read a book and realize how much I have learned while having a good time reading. This is a book that will give you an overview of the history of London over the period of two thousand years! By following the generations of several families that made London their home, Rutherfurd tells many entertaining stories, teaches us about many great events in history, how many different cultures came to this great city and became part of it. For lovers of England and lovers of history, Rutherfurd's three novels, "Sarum", "London" and "The Forest" give a sampler of English history in three distinct regions. They are all great reading and a very fun way to learn. If you liked reading about London in this book, you might also enjoy the excellent book "In Search of London" by H.V. Morton, a very evocative guide to the city and people of London by a great English author.

I have read a lot of outdoor books over the last 40 years, and this is one of the best. I am going to research the author, John J. Rowlands, because he was obviously a fascinating man who lead a very interesting life. This book tells about 12 months living in a cabin on a lake in Northern Onatario. At the time Rowlands was working as a timber cruiser, evaluating forests for use as lumber. He happened upon his ideal lake and was lucky enough to get stationed there by his company. He was also very lucky to have two great friends living within miles (within signaling distance via the various drums, horns etc. they engineered), on other little lakes. Together the three lived every outdoor boy's dream life of independence and adventure. This book has stuff about canoes, wild animals, sled dogs, snowshoes, knives, axes, the history of the lumber camps, and many boy-scout like craft projects. I just wish it was a lot longer.

Ann Rule is THE best true crime author. This is a good, very interesting book, but not one of her great ones. The element of Ann Rule's writing which I admire most, the reason I seek out her books, is the in-depth psychological understanding she brings to her descriptions of the perpetrators. She goes into great detail about their upbringing and the personality disorders that affect them. Although it seems clear that Doctor Debora Green, the subject of this book, has Borderline Personality Disorder, there is much less content than usual about Dr. Green's childhood, first marriage, etc. I also agree with other reviewers who felt uncomfortable accepting Ms Rule's perception of Dr. Green's husband, Dr. Mike Farrar, as an innocent victim. Dr. Farrar was at least irresponsible in having three children with a woman whose behavior was spinning out of control and who was abusing drugs and alcohol. After finding that Dr. Green had apparently poisoned him, and only shortly after attempting to have her committed, why did Dr. Farrar leave the children unprotected with his wife? What about Celeste, the unhappily married woman Mike was having an affair with? Her husband's suicide, and the casual way she and Mike handled it, seemed truly alarming to me. Could this case be much less straightforward than it seems? Was Dr. Green "gaslighted" by her husband and his mistress? Although Ann Rule seems quite taken with Mike and Celeste, it seems clear that this reviewer is not the only one with doubts. A very interesting book.

Ernest Hemingway was not a good person to be friends with and a terrible person to be married to, disloyal and full of rationalizations. But Hemingway was very good at making the reader experience the place and time. You will feel like you are there in Paris during the jazz age. Hemingway will make you remember being 20-something, poor, in love, and married to the one you were in love with. Hemingway's character sketches are detailed and colorful, and the malice he displays toward his friends, some of the most famous figures of the early 20th century, is kind of amusing. Hemingway lets regret seep in about his first marriage, which is touching. Then he blames his second wife for stealing him from his first wife, and the rich for corrupting him! Hemingway can never stop rationalizing and reinventing reality. A lot of the book is about being very poor and hungry. He was never very poor. His first wife, Hadley, had a trust fund which they actually lived on, and he left her for someone skinnier and with a bigger trust fund and a rich uncle!

This is a very atmospheric story about the children of London a century ago. Sara, the heroine of the story, begins the story of a little girl who is rich, and has almost everything, including beauty, brains, imagination, good manners, and a very loving young father. The only thing she doesn't have is a mother or any other family. Her father, though he will miss Sara, enrolls her in a proper English boarding school while he makes his fortune in exotic locales. Sara befriends the underdogs of her school, and is popular for telling wonderful stories, but she is also making enemies. As is the case at schools anywhere and in any age, there are some popular girls who want to torment Sara and her friends, and the sisters who run the school are straight out of Charles Dickens. How Sara keeps her grace when her old life comes to an end has taught stoicism to generations of young people. This story contains grim scenes of misery and poverty and warm, glowing scenes of beauty, magic and kindness. It will warm the heart of children or adults who read it. What a wonderful book to curl up with on a cold, rainy, London-like night.

I was amazed to hear that Stephen King did not think this movie does justice to his book. Even more amazing was how very bad the remake, which King liked, was. I think King must have been feeling sour grapes, because I found this movie WAY better than the book. Any woman who has been abused will recognize Jack Nicholson's smirk, his swagger, and his sarcasm. When he strutted though the hotel's kitchen, smiling as he knocked metal pans around, proud as punch of his machismo, I just cringed. And Shelly Duvall was perfect as the abused wife. Her weakness and ineffectiveness was interspersed with desperate courage in just the right places. This is the only scary movie I can watch over, and over, and over.

We can't assume that, just because we use spell check on the computer, we are writing properly. It seems as though nowadays every word ending in an "s" calls for an apostrophe. It is a matter of choice as to whether the apostrophe comes before or after the "s". Menus, signs, and classified ads always feature creative writing, punctuation and spelling. Every edition of the local newspaper is riddled with grammatical errors. I want my writing to say something better about me. I didn't learn to diagram sentences in high school, so I need some extra help to make sure I am communicating effectively and not showing my ignorance any more than necessary. If you find yourself re-writing sentences because you are not sure about your grammar, this is just the book for you. When I read the book I found several areas where my language use was just not up to par. "Woe Is I" is short enough and has enough flow that you can read it straight through. Then, when you are in the midst of writing, you can refer back to troublesome areas until you become accustomed to using better English. I keep it right beside the computer at work. Then, if I need help figuring out if I should use "its" or if "it's" is proper, I can quickly double check. "Woe Is I" is a really helpful and portable little book.

The first book I remember from my childhood is The Tasha Tudor Book of Fairy Tales. Tasha Tudor's illustrations always include garlands of roses, and I always knew I was going to have a garden absolutely full of roses. As a young adult, I was disillusioned with the modern hybrids that were available at that time. They looked stiff and unlovely in the garden, they had little fragrance, and they fell prey to black spot and the cold northern climate. After spending huge amounts of time, effort, and money, I had given up on roses. Then, in the odd way things happen, I came upon this book in the return shelf at the library. I started reading it, and finally realized what was wrong in my experience with roses. The ideal rose in my imagination was a historic rose, not a modern hybrid tea! Thomas Christopher, even though he was a horticulturist, made the same discovery though serendipity. It is really fun to read how he discovered the world of heirloom roses and the people who grow them. You will find yourself enjoying this book while reading it, and then realizing later how much you learned from it. The book led to my gardening with old roses, and later, David Austin Roses, which are everything I ever hoped for in roses. If you want to read more about the history of the rose, another very interesting book on the subject is The Quest for the Rose by Phillips and Rix.

Jesse Stuart was a great author who lived an amazing life. His family was very poor, and though they loved the land they could never hold on to one piece of it. His parents had no book learning. Mr. Stuart went to incredible lengths to get a very extensive education but never lost his love of the beautiful farmland and wildland of the mountains. Once he had money, he set out to buy every piece of land his father had farmed. He stayed friends with the simple folks he knew when young. This book tells they story of both sides of the world he grew up in, the town, with its school and fancy people, and the hills with the plain folks he loved so much. In later life he travelled around the world telling others about the beautiful country and genuine people he grew up with and trying to fight poverty and ignorance. I am so glad "Hie to the Hunters" is still in print so young people will remember this amazing man and his world.

I agree with almost every other reviewer in that I found this third-person account really distracting and annoying. I think I could have tolerated the terrible and ignorant writing if the author had just used the first person. But the story itself is amazing. The author, Margie Danielsen, actually saw her abusive husband, who had married her using a false identity, profiled on "America's Most Wanted"! Inexplicably, she went on to hire a private investigator and endanger herself and her children, when she could have simply contacted the number on the screen and told law enforcement about her suspicions. She should have saved the money she spent on the PI to hire a better ghost writer or editor. Margie probably seemed like the perfect victim to Paul Mack. She kept ignoring her common sense over and over, forgiving him even as his behavior became more strange and threatening. What I found truly fascinating about this book is that it gives us a look inside the mind of the all-too-willing victim of a pathological narcissist and con man. This woman was looking for her prince charming. As is the case with so many of us looking for a relationship too good to be true, she found instead a user and criminal who had no problem telling her just what she wanted to hear. In the course of a very brief marriage, Paul Mack lied constantly, had Margie sign over all of her assets to him, and even had his friends kidnap her children. Pathological narcissists are amazingly good at recruiting friends and even law enforcement and court officials in their campaigns of harassment and manipulation against their victims. Particularly telling is the part where, after being imprisoned for murder, Mack continued to attempt to prey on Margie and his vulnerable teenage daughter, who wanted to believe her father was a victim of the system. Mack alternated attempts to use charm and menace against Margie right up to the end of the book, from inside the walls of prison.

I am so glad this book is still in print. It is one of my very favorites, and I read it at least once per year, like Huckleberry Finn. For those of us who love nature, and tales of growing up in the out-of-doors, this is a beautiful book of the natural world and agricultural lands. It contains wonderful sketches about farm life in the turn-of-the century English countryside, school life, and village characters. This book reminds me of Cider With Rosie (also called The Edge of Day) by Laurie Lee, another excellent book about growing up in England, set around the time of WWI. This is truly worthwhile reading. If you have read "Lark Rise to Candleford" and enjoyed it, another book by Flora Thompson, "Still Glides the Stream", deals with the same subject matter and is also very good.

Kin Platt did not write down to young readers. This is a very intelligently written mystery. The reader will definitely pick up all kinds of knowledge in reading it. It is a great adventure. As a young teen in the '70s I really loved "The Blue Man" by Kinn Platt, and was really happy to find two more books about Steve, the very smart and brave hero. I can't believe this awesome book is out of print. If you have a chance to read it, do so, regardless of your age. You'll love it!

I read any book about narcissism eagerly, but this one disappointed me. The title "Narcissism and Intimacy" implied to me that this book would explain the frustrating and psychologically devastating maze that is life with a pathological narcissist. It didn't. Maybe because it is a book more about therapy than real life experiences, I found it murky and did not teach me anything new about the subject. Usually I find it heartening to read accounts of the impact of the narcissist on the lives of their significant others, but I really got nothing out of this book. I also got the idea the author was discussing regular narcissism, a personality trait, as opposed to pathological narcissism, a personality disorder. If you want to read a great book that will explain everything you want to know about pathological narcissism, read Sam Vaknin's book "Malignant Self Love", which is long and a little expensive, but really the ultimate book on the subject and worth every penny. If you want something shorter and less expensive, try "When Your Perfect Partner Goes Perfectly Wrong" by Mary Jo Fay.

I really enjoyed "Hard Eight". Like all of the Stephanie Plum novels, this one is a mish-mash of comedy, adventure, mystery, and sexual tension. Stephanie is famous in her family's blue-collar neighborhood as a bounty hunter. Mable, the old lady in the adjoining house, has lost her most of her family one by one and lives on Social Security and government surplus food handouts. So how can Stephanie refuse to help her find her missing granddaughter Evelyn? Evelyn's inept but kind hearted divorce lawyer, Albert Kloughn, who operates out of a laundomat, decides to become Stephanie's assistant bounty hunter. Soon Stephanie, Albert, and Lula are looking for Evelyn with help from the sexy and mysterious bounty hunter Ranger. Stephanie is being menaced by the very creepy Eddie Abruzzi, Evelyn's landlord who is also the money behind the bar owned by Evelyn's abusive ex-husband. Morelli and Stephanie are on the outs, which gives Ranger a chance to finally put the moves on Stephanie. Yeah!

It is so fun to read this series of mysteries featuring a "prickly" middle-aged woman who is addicted to love, has to work hard to keep her waistline from expanding and hairs from sprouting in inopportune places, yet is really successful and a worthwhile human being. Her friends are very amusing too. I like that Agatha's boyfriends are all flawed. I am glad she has grown more charitable with age. This process started in the very first book, as soon as Agatha fulfilled her dream of retiring to a charming Cotswold village and learned to make friends. Like some other reviewers, I don't like the books as well since Agatha openined her detective agency, but to keep the books coming, I guess change has to happen. These books are a great way to spend a winter evening. If you read one, you will have to read all of them. When you finish with Agatha Raisin, the series about Scottish policeman Hamish MacBeth is great fun too.

This is my very favorite book for young girls. First and most importantly, it is really fun to read. I can just picture an 8-year-old girl reading this during summer vacation. After reading this book, how could a kid not fall in love with reading books for recreation? It is loaded with thrilling adventure. Even though the main character is a girl, she is not a "girly girl" at all. She is an outdoor farm girl who loves nature and has an active curiosity about the world around her. The characters are lovely, and lovingly portrayed. The sketches of Garnet's pesky younger brother, restless older brother, mother and father stressed out by trying to make a farm work at the end of the depression and drought, her friend Citronella, and the people of Garnet's farm community are amazing writing and enjoyable, educational reading. There are many interesting stories about people who Garnet meets during her beautiful and exciting summer. Citronella's grandmother tells a story about growing up as a settler which is not just interesting because it is about pioneer life, meeting Indians, and her childhood adventures, it may also encourage young readers to find out about their own grandparent's stories. The account of the family firing limestone to build a new barn is fascinating, and the family meets and adopts a wonderful boy who they encounter while spending the night minding the kiln. His story really brings home the realities of the depression, when adults and children travelled the rails and backroads of America to find work and food. The contrast between Garnet, who loves the land, her older brother, who has seen the stress his father goes through to wring his living from it and wants to get away, and the young hobo who has experienced the wider world and loves the steadiness and bounty of the farm are deeper elements to the story. The story of farm life, weather, and nature is wonderful, and I am sure many, many children have fallen in love with nature and reading from this classic book.

I wait with great anticipation for each new book by Ann Rule. She is simply the best true crime author ever. I gobbled up this collection of short true crime stories in one night. The book-length story was well-written, detailed, and a fascinating story, but the story that I found most gripping and disturbing was about a young office worker abducted from her job at a halfway house. Several of Ann Rule's books, such as "Everything She Ever Wanted" and "Small Sacrifices" have been truly great because she delves so deeply into the character and background of the perpetrator she is writing about. I miss this in most of her short story collections, including "No Regrets". Many of the crimes in the collections are old, truly from another era. In "No Regrets", Ann Rule has disguised these old cases by not mentioning what year they took place, and leaving out details that would date the story. This is too bad, because one of her usual stong points is putting the reader in the place, setting the scene.

This isn't just a romance. It's worse. Take a generic romance novel, with lame characters, and meld it with an episode of the old Knight Rider television show, and you've got it. How and why could an author capable of the humor and wisdom that we see in the Stephanie Plum books, put her name on a book like this?

I have little patience for most books about families or relationships. This book is the exception. Mr. Russo really knows about small towns and their class structures and family histories. Mr. Russo also knows about the paradoxes of modern blue-collar life. This is an honest, engrossing book about people that feel real and it made me examine the patterns and decisions I have made in my own life. If you are a thoughtful, reflective person you will love this book.

I am an adult, not usually fond of television or movies, yet I absolutely love InuYasha. I had the tv on cartoon network one night, and just started watching an episode, and got addicted. The story is very sweet, yet there is a lot of adventure and fantasy, with beautiful artwork. If you are thinking about starting to watch this series, or buying it for someone else, I would say "go for it!" I don't know how you could help but love it. It is much cheaper to buy the whole season than the dvds with just a few episodes, and once you start you won't be able to stop watching, so you might as well get the boxed set. The movies (there are four) are also excellent.

I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago. When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it". Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again. This mascara will NOT smudge! It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line. It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off. It also does not irritate my eyes. I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes. I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles. I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued. When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away. As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it. It makes your lashes look really long! They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct. This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using. I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water. It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara. It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it. I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again. Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind.

I really enjoyed Donna Anders' thrillers, and was looking for another author who wrote suspenseful, scary books I could curl up on the couch with on a cold rainy evening. Most of the thrillers written from a female point of view seem to be thinly disguised romance novels and the heroines are helpless twits, but happily I have now discovered Wendy Corsi Staub. I have read several of her books and they are all good and scary, with female characters I can respect and relate to. "Lullaby and Goodnight" is about Peyton, a thirty-nine year old woman living in Manhattan, with a successful career but no relationship and a ticking biological clock. She decides to become artifically inseminated (she is not pregnant by a former lover, as an earlier reviewer wrote). She becomes friends with another single mother-to-be in a support group. When her new friend disappears, strange and frightening things start happening to Peyton. You will be kept on the edge of your seat up to the last page.

"Sleeping Dogs" is the sequel to "The Butcher's Boy". The Butcher's Boy was raised by a butcher whose main income came from being a professional assassin. After being forced to kill a number of mob figures in "The Butcher's Boy" he fled to England and retired on his earnings. He found a girlfriend, a member of the English aristocracy named the Honorable Meg, and managed to lay low for ten years. When Meg took him to the races, a young man who witnessed the killing of one of his Mafia relatives as a child and a couple of low-level henchmen tried to kill him. The assassin then mistakenly thinks the Mafia put out a contract on him, and he returns to the United States to eliminate the men he thinks are out to get him again. He's been out of the action for a long time, and the world has changed a lot, with more computers and checking of documents at airports. As in the previous book, the reader finds it impossible to avoid rooting for the assassin, a retired craftsman, totally out of the loop, who just wants to be left alone. This book is a thrill a minute and a laugh a minute, and very very well written. Thomas Perry is a really great author!

I normally greatly enjoy reading accounts of women hiking the Appalachian Trail. Hikers telling their own story don't just tell about the trail, they tell about themselves. Often they have a very unique personality and it is interesting to get to know them. In this case, not so much. The author of this book, Adrienne Hall, is very young, and her interests and personality are those of a self-important high school girl (think Meadow Soprano from the HBO series). She writes very long passages about the environment that are very preachy and sanctimonious. She writes a lot about her boyfriend and what other people should do about the environment, and not so much about how the trail helped her grow as a person. This is one of the very few Appalachian Trail books I have read where I found myself struggling to stick with reading, frequently skipping pages.

"Safe Harbor" is one of the best true crime books I have read. It is not the kind of journalistic true crime story that just dwells on the crime itself, the ugly details or the police investigation. The author sets the scenes skillfully. The reader can place themselves in New York City or Nantucket, and really feel what the characters' lives were like. McDonald delves into the background and psychology of the victim and her killer, and leads us through the personal history that created their personalities. When I think about a crime, I don't focus on how much blood was splashed around or how many times the victim was stabbed. I wonder what could drive a well-educated, handsome executive to live a life of lies and criminal acts culminating in the murder of a wonderful, successful woman who could have created a fulfilling life with him. Brian McDonald delves deep and creates a really well-written and sensitive book. If you are an admirer of true crime author Ann Rule, this book will really appeal to you.

I have read almost every book ever written about Marilyn Monroe, most of them very bad and only one very good. Any time I start to think about Marilyn, I think of Carl Jung. Biography is often so crude, it is not a tool to grasp what it is about Marilyn Monroe that fascinates us. Joyce Carol Oates is a great author who found a great subject for literature. Marilyn is an archetypal figure and the way Oates put her story together gave me goosebumps! I read once that Sylvia Plath dreamed about Marilyn Monroe. After reading "Blonde", so do I.

There are a few things I like about this pot. You can get it in attractive colors to match you Le Creuset cookware. It lighter and easier to lift, and also cheaper than my "good" Le Creuset cast iron cookware. It is good for boiling pasta. It is not good for cooking anything that might stick or scorch! I am not a bad cook, but I keep having things stick in the bottom of this pan, which also wore quickly in spite of using gentle stirring implements. It is simply not a high-performance pan, but for just boiling things in water, it comes in handy, and you don't have to be embarrassed if you leave it sitting out, since it's pretty.

I have always loved "magical" books, and this is definitely one of them. Michael is a young Irish boy living in Brooklyn in the late '40s. His father was killed in the war. Michael loves baseball and comic books. There is an Irish gang doing violence in his neighborhood. Beware, there are some very upsetting and graphic incidents in this book! The code of the street, Michael's ethnicity, and sheer survival say he needs to look the other way, but Michael is a really good boy, on his way to being a really good man. Fate introduces Michael to a rabbi in his neighborhood, and Michael introduces him to baseball, while the rabbi teaches Michael the secrets of the Jewish faith. Michael has a thirst for knowledge, and the mysticism of Judaism hold vast appeal. But being the good friend of the rabbi will obviously mean big trouble for Michael. I learned a lot about the Jewish faith, a lot about New York City, and I really enjoyed reading this exciting and magical book.

"Henry Reed, Inc." is the first of a series of books about a fourteen-year-old boy who is the son of a diplomat. The book was written in the late fifties and is Henry's journal about what happens when he is sent to New Jersey to spend the summer with his relatives. His teacher gave him an assignment to report on the free enterprise system in the United States, so Henry starts a business. Soon he has acquired a dog and a business partner in the form of the girl next door, Midge. Their adventures are hilarious and innocent. All of the Henry Reed books are really entertaining and to me epitomize what a summer vacation should be about. They would be perfect for readers over ten.

"Emotional Unavailability" fills a big gap in books about troubled or abusive relationships. The title "Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them" seemed so promising to me when I was trying to figure out the seemingly inexplicable events of what I had thought was the love of my life, but the book told me nothing of value, so then I read "Women Who Love Too Much". Both books, though female readers seemed to love them, did nothing to explain how someone who claimed to love you could lie to you, steal from you, and abuse and denigrate you to others. The books seemed to blame the victim. I for one would never get together with a man who was abusive. The authors of these books assume that a woman in a bad relationship had agreed to the abuse. This is so wrong. I was seduced by a handsome, loving, successful man who seemed to think I was the best woman he had ever met. Only after I had altered my life course to be with him did the strange behavior start, and in the beginning there was always a good explanation. As my emotional and financial investment became greater, his performance as an emotionally stable person disintegrated. At great cost to myself, I left him, but I still wanted to know what had happened and why. The books I read told me nothing. Only through chance did I read a description of narcissistic personality disorder, and after much research found out that many other women had been through the exact same experience as I had, and that there were books written about such destructive relationships with pathological narcissists. Why didn't the books I had turned to in desperation at least mention the possiblity that the abuser has a personality disorder? "Emotional Unavailability" fills this gap. If you are in a bad relationship, and feel like you are not the one who is crazy, this book is the ideal first step in getting to the heart of the problem. Not only will the book help you figure out what is going on in the head of your abuser, it does not hesitate to tell you to get out of the relationship. This sounds rather obvious, but a lot of self help books give tips on STAYING with an abusive partner, and don't even recommend LEAVING. A very useful book.

Ann Rule is by far the best true crime writer, and this is her best book. It is not just that she writes about dramatic subjects that are sure to be fascinating, she really puts you in the locale (you feel like you are in the desert in Arizona or in the Pacific Northwest), and you feel that you have really met the people she writes about (Diane Downs reminded me strongly of someone I know). A person can gain a lot of understanding about the predators among us by reading Ann Rule's books. Many people simply can't believe that a mother would kill her own children to try to keep a lover. When you read about Diane Downs, you will really feel you know and understand her. This book is very well written, and the author has a huge amount of psychological insight. Anything by Ann Rule is worth reading, but this book is worth reading again, and again.

Here is another true crime classic by Ann Rule. I think her description of Bradley Cunningham is one of the most insightful, thorough and chilling she has ever written. Cunningham, a pathological narcissist, used his assumed charm to lure many women into his web of lies and abuse. Each of his many wives thought they were getting the perfect husband, and each soon learned that they were very mistaken. He did not limit his psychological and physical abuse to his women, either. He treated his many children just as badly. Personally, I can't feel as much sympathy as I should for Bradley's wife Cheryl, an attorney who he ultimately beat to death. Cheryl had been having an affair with Brad, who was married to her former sorority sister and supposed friend. Brad convinced his wife, a teacher, to quit her excellent job when she was pregnant, and they moved to an expensive new condo. Cheryl, posing as her friend, helped with the moving. With the baby due any day, Cheryl then gleefully served her with divorce papers at the door of her new home. Cheryl and Brad's married life was one of financial shenanigans, and Brad liked to have sex with the babysitters they hired to take care of the three children Cheryl had with Brad. By the time Cheryl got around to divorcing him, Bradley had met his next wife, a beautiful and well-to-do doctor named Sara. The new woman in Brad's life did not protect Cheryl from Brad's wrath, though. Sara is a much more sympathetic figure than Cheryl. She loved and protected Brad's children, but in spite of her beauty and success, Brad was soon cheating on her and embezzling her money. Sara's life became a living hell, and she was not to be the last woman Brad tormented. Next came the young nanny Brad turned into a stripper, and Brad took the money she earned, too. Several female members of Brad's family and Brad's ex's finally got some justice by testifying against him at his murder trial. Brad is most likely still shaking down women for money from inside his prison cell. A fascinating and cautionary tale, especially for women dating.

I think "Eleven on Top" was an especially good Stephanie Plum book. Stephanie decides it's time to quit her job working for her cousin Vinnie's bail bond company. Bringing in criminals on the lam is so much easier for Ranger and Tank, Stephanie and her friend Lula end up tasered and covered in messy garbage as often as they recover a fugitive. Stephanie's lucky, she immediately lands a job at the button factory, which she loses after showing up late on her first day. She also lands job with the drycleaner from hell and Cluck in a Bucket. The fast food uniform, complete with chicken hat, is the least of the drawbacks. Meanwhile, Lula needs help with apprehensions, wedding plans are progressing for Stephanie's sister, and someone is out to kill Stephanie. The adventure, suspense, humor and sexual tension in this installment are even better than the previous ten!

This is not your average true crime book! The story of Barbra Piotrowski and Richard Minns is the quintessential narcissistic relationship. It is fascinating to see just how manipulative and successful a narcissist can become, using family, friends, strangers, hired thugs, the legal system, and law enforcement to seduce, posess, and nearly destroy the life of his victim. A self-made local celebrity, Minns lived the ultimate narcissistic existance, honing his body at the gym (which he owned), bleaching his hair at the beauty shop, keeping a wife and kids in one house while openly escorting his much younger, blonde, beautiful "fiance" around the same town, in front of his own kids and friends of his real family. As other reviewers pointed out, Barbra, though the victim of monstrous and unbelievable manipulation, was too much of a user to be a truly sympathetic character, as the author attempted to portray her. She was definitely an opportunist. I don't think this hurts the book, though. The reader obviously draws her own conclusions about the character of Barbra and will not be led by the author. And, ultimately, no one deserves the mind-bending gaslighting and physical abuse Barbra went through, let alone the horrible crime which finally ended the relationship. This book is truly riveting. The term page-turner could have been invented to describe this book. It stacks up to the best of Ann Rule, which from me is the ultimate accolade.

"In My Blood" reminded me of how few generations it takes to get from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War to present times. John Sedgwick is a very engaging narrator of his family history. After experiencing an emotional breakdown and going into therapy, Mr. Sedgwick decides to delve into a treasure trove of family documents going back to Revolutionary times to examine the interplay of mental illness and success and creativity in his family. The house built by Theodore Sedgwick is still in the family, held in trust, full of old pictures, letters, and diaries. More documents from important members of the family are in library collections. This book could be stuffy and self-important, but John Sedgwick somehow manages to bring out the admirable, the deplorable, and the tragic in these generations in a loving, easygoing way that made me feel like I had sat down for a very interesting talk with a very nice person.

This is the only flashlight to have. It is tough, bright, and durable. It will not break, and if you replace the batteries, it will never let you down. If someone attacks you, you can beat them with it, and it will still work. Compared to the Maglight, any other flashlight is worse than useless. Face it, your flashlight is a serious personal survival tool, and it is stupid to be stuck with one that is just a cheap toy. Put one in your vehicle and one by the side of your bed, and I guarantee you will never regret it. The company is also pretty amazing. I bought a maglight at a large store once, and someone had removed the gasket and some other parts. I called the company toll-free, and they not only sent me the parts I needed at no charge, the sent me extras, and they came in the mail within a few days!

It would be nice if it were easy to scout out a river before driving to an access point and paddling it. This book does it for you. The directions to access points and places to park are very detailed and good. The maps are excellent and very clear. There are written notes on the problems or special circumstances you will encounter, which are very intelligent and accurate. I checked the rivers I have paddled and read the remarks, and they are just what you need to know, and they are true. The author really knows what he is writing about, this is not a book thrown together by someone who hasn't actually been on the river.

I have been reading a lot of thrillers lately, and have decided that Carlene Thompson is by far my favorite writer in this genre. Her books are very well written. Her characters are much more intelligent and self reliant than most. I have been distracted and annoyed by the poor grammar, characters' names changing out of the author or editor's carelessness, and overly elaborate descriptions of characters' clothing I have encountered all too often in my recent reading. Carlene Thompson writes a very exciting, suspenseful story in a very literate way. I found "Tonight You're Mine" to be about the best and most exciting suspense story out of approximately 30 I have read in the last month.

Hannah Wolfe is a young, hip London private detective. There are three Hannah Wolfe books, "Fat Farm", "Birth Marks", and "Under My Skin". In "Under My Skin", Hannah goes undercover at an exclusive spa. Someone has been playing some nasty tricks to hurt the business. It sounds like an easy job, and Hannah can get some free beauty treatments, but as usual in a Hannah Wolfe mystery, things soon get more complicated and more serious. All three of these mysteries are really well-written, intelligent, modern, and very fun to read. I really like Hannah, who is very smart, competent and resilient, and funny, without being annoyingly tough. I recommend this series very highly.

The romantic suspense genre is definitely divided into books that are more romance, and those that are more suspense. This book is definitely a romance. I am always happy when I find a suspenseful book with a heroine who is an intelligent human being, as opposed to the kind of stupid ninny often portrayed in romances, who makes inexplicable decisions and falls into bed with unappealing men who behave inappropriately and abusively. I was not too happy with this book. It portrayed women as stupid and inept. Aaron Cane, the love interest, is very creepy. A smart, savvy woman would not become involved with him. Although Christy McKenna is presented as a wise and experienced professional, her actions and thought process quickly reveal her to be naive, childish, and stupid. It was hard for me to get involved in the mystery because I didn't like the characters.

This is Volume 6 of Ann Rule's Crime Files. Some of Ann Rule's best books have been her "Crime Files" collections, but only when the volume is built around a book-length treatment of a fairly fresh case. The best collection by far has been "Last Dance, Last Chance". This book is somewhat like "Without Pity" in that the cases all seem kind of old. If, like me, you are a big Ann Rule fan who can't get enough, and waits anxiously for each new title, you should definitely get this book. It contains some interesting cases, just none that will knock your socks off. There is not the psychological depth here that we hope for in Ann Rule's very best work, that leaves the reader totally blown away. If you are new to Ann Rule, read one of her truly great books, like "Small Sacrifices", "The Stranger Beside Me", or "Everything She Ever Wanted". Read any of these and you will be hooked on Ann Rule too.

I ordered three books on similar subjects, "Viruses, Plagues, and History", "Man and Microbes", and "Plagues and Peoples" at the same time. Each book has something different to recommend it. My least favorite was "Plagues and Peoples". The writing was pompous and cumbersome, and while the thesis of the book, that man's relationship to society and our planet is pathogenic, is interesting, it can be conveyed in one sentence. There is not a lot of readable material about the actual history of disease in the book. I got a lot more by far out of both "Man and Microbes" and "Viruses, Plagues, and History". Both of these books are filled with interesting facts and stories of how disease has impacted human history. I will definitely keep and re-read both books. As an earlier reviewer noted, the first section of "Viruses, Plagues, and History", entitled "Introduction to the Principles of Virology" is pretty intimidating. If the science bothers the reader too much, it really doesn't hurt to skip this chapter. Maybe the rest of the book will interest the non-scientific reader enough so he will go back and read this section later. Part Two of the book is entitled "Success Stories". It contains fascinating and very graphic descriptions of some very bad diseases and interesting stories about the effects these diseases have had on the course of history. Part Three is "Present and Future Challenges", about some of the newly emerging diseases that are making headlines today. The author is a true professional in the biomedical field, and in his preface, he tells about reading "Microbe Hunters" in junior high and how it inspired him in his education and career to meet many of the foremost experts on viral diseases and become one himself. I think this is a very, very interesting book.

This is one of my very favorite young-adult books. It has everything: adventure, the love of nature, a boy and his dogs, and the lessons of growing up. Make sure you have boxes of kleenex handy, because there is also deep sadness that comes with life's big hard lessons. Almost too painful to read, but a beautiful book. If you liked this book, another heartbreaker of a boy and his dog you might like is "Sounder".

I have read several books by Carlene Thompson and she is by far my favorite suspense writer. "Don't Close Your Eyes" is a very exciting book which kept me entertained and guessing up to the last page. This is one of the few suspense writers who does not insult the reader: you won't find the usual tortured grammar or characters straight out of a Harlequin Romance novel in Carlene Thompson's books. The main character, a 29-year-old veteranarian, is intelligent and talented without being cloyingly perfect, and while it is clear she and the new sheriff in her childhood hometown share a mutual attraction, she is not swooning helplessly in his arms. I did wonder how Jeff Lindstrom managed to wear both jeans and suit pants at the same time on page 309, but this is easily excused, given the high caliber of writing that prevails in all of Thompson's writing. I have ordered every book by this author. She is really great!

I can never wait for the next Agatha Raisin or Hamish Macbeth book to come out. These are just the books for you if you would like to curl up on the couch with your cat or dog (or, if you are like Hamish, your cat and your dog), with a cup of tea or a dram of something stronger. M.C. Beaton writes really fun and entertaining stories. There is always a little humor, eccentric village characters, highland scenery, and just enough mystery to keep things going. If you want an intellectual challenge, these are not the books for you. Kind of like in the tv show "Murder She Wrote" people do keep dieing, but never in a graphic way that will make you lose sleep. Police Constable Hamish Macbeth is a very endearing character. He is youngish and handsomish and bravish, but is enough of a slacker to be really likable. His life in the little town of Lochdubh in northern Scotland is comforting and idyllic, with good friends, his loyal wild cat and dog, and the mildly annoying villagers and disturbing outsiders to keep things happening. Love causes a lot of trouble in "Death of a Dreamer". Hamish has had quite a few girlfriends over the years, and two old ones and one new one complicate his life in this story. Incomer Effie Garrard also falls in love, with deadly repercussions. Even Hamish's seemingly safely married and stodgy boss, Daviot, is troubled by love in this installment.

The question "why did the person who claimed to love me so much attempt to destroy me" has led me to read and think a lot about the contents of hundreds of books. This is one of the best I have read. Lundy Bancroft gives a very simple and sensible answer: entitlement and lack of respect. The abuser feels entitled to a fantasy woman, who will gratefully smooth the way for him, providing him with a financial support, a clean, comfortable house, good food, unconditional emotional support, and a perfect, attractive, sex partner willing to do anything to please him. To obtain this, all he has to do is attract and court a woman who he fantasizes is going to make this happen. Saying the words "I love you" and a year or so of good behavior is a pretty cheap price to obtain a perfect servant for life. When the woman, who has no idea of his agenda, fails to live up to his fantasy, he concludes that he has been ripped off, that she has lied to him and failed him, and then he proceeds to try to destroy her. He may shove her, hit her, scream at her, or try to make her feel worthless or even insane. This is called devaluation. Lundy Bancroft lists the warning signs of a potentially abusive suitor, and a lot of misery would be eliminated if dating women were given this list to memorize. As well as explaining what motivates abusers, the book also reveals a lot about the methodical tactics of abuse that I did not find in many other books, particularly mind-boggling yet common tactics such as gaslighting the victim and alienating the victim from her friends and family through lies and manipulation. Abuse is not just physical violence. The chapter on how the abuser gets others such as the police and court officials to help in his abuse is simply horrifying. I would highly recommend this book to teens and women dating, women who feel that their partner is emotionally or physically abusing them, and therapists, police, and court personnel.

Have you ever known someone who was a constant liar and con-man or woman? Who would make a statement and then contradict themselves in the next breath? Who rationalized everything and accepted blame for nothing? If so, you were probably dealing with a pathological narcissist. Some are so skillful in their manipulation that they carry on for years without friends or family figuring out what is wrong. Some of the most susceptible people will defend their narcissistic manipulator to their last breath, or the last dollar left in their bank account. The killer in this book is Liysa Northon, a female narcissist. Look up narcissistic personality disorder in the dictionary and you should find Niysa Northon. It is very interesting and alarming to read about her lifetime career of manipulating and using people. She spent her entire life weaving an intricate web of lies, thus the title of the book. Another fascinating aspect of her personality is the need to always project an image of being the most successful, most beautiful, most hip person in any room, her graduating class, etc. The reader gets the impression that Ann Rule really has to strain to hold up her saintly and pristine portrayal of the victim, Liysa's third husband Chris Northon. Usually Rule whitewashes the victim beyond all reason. In this case Rule reluctantly reveals that Chris could be a total jerk, though she drastically minimizes his obvious faults. As an earlier reviewer observed, together Chris and Liysa BOTH made a really unlikable couple. Because it is so hard to sympathize with either the killer or her victim, this book did not score among my very favorite books by Ann Rule. Somehow I just don't enjoy reading a book where I dislike every character as much as one where I find myself empathizing with either the victim or the killer. Still "Heart Full of Lies" is a fascinating and well-written story.

This is the first volume of Ann Rule's Crime Files. It contains one long story and five shorter stories. The main story is about Randy Roth, a pathological narcissist who married women for the express purpose of killing them and collecting insurance and social security money. He was a short cocky guy from a trashy family who worked out and stayed in shape to lure his victims. He wore cowboy boots to add a few inches to his height. He got fired from several jobs for stealing. He made a pretense of being a martial arts expert and pretended to be a Viet Nam vet who saw bloody combat, and claimed to have gone on "top secret missions", though he was too young to have seen combat in Viet Nam. He also used his cute son as a decoy. One scarey aspect of the story of Randy Roth is that so many of us have known men who fit this exact description. But Randy didn't stop at being a pathological liar and con man, he actually went as far as killing two of his wives. The stories of a few more potential victims who got away, and the underage daughter of his neighbors, who finally managed to see through Randy's abuse and manipulation, added an interesting aspect to the crime. This story is every bit as well-developed as a full-length book by Ann Rule. The shorter stories in this volume are also good ones. They are not as involved, but they are just as well written, with all of Rule's usual gift of character and setting.

The story of Tim Harris, Florida State Patrolman, is one of Ann Rule's most memorable characterizations. When he used a phoney traffic stop to meet his future wife as a young police officer, she was a young and naive teenager. For years he abused her and groomed her to be the perfect servile victim. Only when she discovered she had a rival for his attentions did she begin to rebel against his authority. Not only did Tim abuse his wife, he abused females on his beat, also. Ann Rule, who is very fond of law enforcement, would disagree with me, but I don't find it surprising that a control freak like Tim Harris would find law enforcement an appealing career, for after all it gave him the opportunity to pull over and intimidate female drivers and get paid for doing it. There was a very similar case in California, a respected state trooper who liked to pull over attractive young female drivers on a deserted highway off-ramp. There were complaints about the California officer also, but the good old boys network shelters these abusers until they finally go all the way and actually commit murder. This book is Volume 2 of "Ann Rule's Crime Files", and contains several other interesting short cases in addition to the book-length story. Very good true-crime writing.

I have read several thrillers by Wendy Corsi Staub and found them all to be very exciting page-turners. In "Dearly Beloved", three women are lured to an old inn on a nearly deserted island in the off-season. The setting is very atmospheric, the characters are well-developed, and the plot is exciting. If you are a reader of thrillers, like me, you will probably really like this book. I especially appreciate that this is not a romance novel in disguise. There are no straining heaving bosoms or taught thighs in Wendy Corsi Staub's writing. Lisa Jackson's endorsement printed on the cover of the Staub books, "If you like Mary Higgins Clark, you'll love Wendy Corsi Staub" is more than accurate, I have found Mary Higgins Clark's books to contain truly horrible grammar, no atmosphere, and characters that are barely two-dimensional. Actually, Mary Higgins Clark's writing consists of plot only in her more recent books, so I would place Wendy Corsi Staub far ahead of Mary Higgins Clark as a suspense writer.

"Wintering" by Kate Moses is a novelization of the very last days of the life of Sylvia Plath. I have read several biographies of Plath, and two novelizations, "Wintering" and "Sylvia and Ted" by Emma Tennant. Nobody is impartial about the life and death of Sylvia Plath: her varied biographers, people who knew Plath, readers and reviewers on Amazon. Many reviewers felt Moses' book was too emotional and presented in a florid, overly detailed writing style. The same criticism appeared in the reviews of "Sylvia and Ted". I found the writing style totally appropriate to the subject matter: Plath's life was filled with frenzy and drama. I would compare the writing style of both novels to "Blonde", a novelization of the life of Marilyn Monroe. Women of the 50s and 60s strove to have it all, success and recognition, love and marriage. Both Sylvia and Marilyn worked very hard to be good enough, yet no matter how much they achieved, they were always thwarted, their success snatched away and their fragile psyches battered over and over. In Sylvia's case, there were always lesser interlopers who claimed the prize she felt should be hers: her baby brother pushing her from the family spotlight, a situation made worse by the death of her father (by dying, he insured she could never please him), lesser academic rivals making it into a cherished writers' workshop when she did not, her husband Ted's strangely posessive sister, and snotty and snobbish Dido Merwyn, sitting in judgement on Sylvia, an insipid girl student at Smith, a sixteen year old babysitter, and finally and most punishingly, Assia Wevill. In "Wintering", Moses totally nailed the image of Assia eyeing Sylvia's life, accomplishments, and possessions and deciding to take them for herself. We can feel Sylvia's disgust and despair: how could Ted, who knew her soul, prefer the shallow and grasping Assia? But by spewing forth a litter of new, powerful and emotionally laden poems, then dramatically and mysteriously ending her own life, Sylvia did in a way finally manage to win. Sylvia's enemies were left with her leftovers: Ted and Assia were cursed (and weak enough) to remain in her cast-off homes, spending the money earned by her talent and labor, raising her children.

Jim Kjelgarrd writes exciting outdoor adventures for young people. The heroes are always very independent and self-sufficient. Alan and his father ran a hunting lodge until his father was sent to prison for a fight with an obnoxious client. Alan holds down the fort while his father is gone. There is a feud with a clan of nasty neighbors, who have cut off the wildlife runway that brought business to the hunting camp. What Alan has to go through at the hands of his father's enemies is really upsetting. I find the books where the young hero has to fight bears less disturbing than the ones where human enemies try to ruin the heroes life. It's too much like real life! Alan, who has no hunting dog, rescues a great retriever who has been shot. It takes work to win the dog's trust, but like all of Kjelgaard's heroes, Alan proves worthy. Adding to the conflict is that the dog is an outlaw, accused of being rabid and attacking his owner. Then Alan finds himself an outlaw too! Loads of suspense and adventure, and lots of lessons about life. It's not an easy world out there, but by being a straight shooter and stoic, Alan and Stormy tough it out!

If you enjoyed "Cider With Rosie" by Laurie Lee, you are sure to also like "Lark Rise to Candleford" and "Still Glides the Stream" by Flora Thompson. These three books are all gentle, loving, and humorous recollections of childhoods spent in English villages. I first read "Lark Rise to Candlford" in Junior High. I have read it again almost every year, because it is one of my favorite books, full of the author's appreciation of the out-of-doors and agricultural ways, but I did not know Flora Thompson had written another book. When I received "Still Glides the Stream" in the mail, I was delighted to find that it exactly matches my illustrated "Cider With Rosie" and "Lark Rise to Candleford". All three books have similar covers and feature cut-outs of dried leaves, flowers, and insects, and paintings and sketches of farm and small-town life. In "Still Glides the Stream", Charity Finch, a retired schoolteacher, returns to the village of her childhood after the end of WWII. She remembers what life was like in "Restharrow", a made-up village in Oxfordshire. She has many warm memories of the unique characters and traditions which began disappearing after WWI and even more so after WWII. If you have an affection for old days and old ways, you are sure to find this is a charming, lovely and interesting book.

If you are reading about narcissism, you will see Otto Kernberg's name cited as a reference more than any other. Dr. Kernberg is THE expert on the subject. Dr. Kernberg's book "Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism" was obviously written for professionals and serious students of psychology, but since he does not have to rely on obfuscation to impress anyone with his credentials, he has written a book that is amazingly clear even to the layman. In our times, personality disorders have overtaken neurosis as the big problem causer for individuals, families, and society. Personality disorders are complex, with layers like an onion, but they are also interesting to research. My interest in Narcissistic Personality Disorder began with the epiphany that this disorder was what I was dealing with in a problematic significant other. Defining the problem helped a lot with my frustration and anger at having been devalued, lied to and stolen from by someone who was supposed to love me. Once I knew "what" I had encountered, I next found myself driven to find out "why". What causes the narcissist to form the false identity shell of feigned superiority, scorn for and devaluation of others, lies, cheating, and constant use of defense mechanisms? If you want to delve deeper than the pop-psyche or self help books on this subject, try reading this book. My copy is filled with highlighted paragraphs, paperclips, and notations in the margins. Here is a quote from page 81 of the paperback edition: "...a primitive, sadistic mother image may be projected onto the therapist while the patient experiences himself as the frightened, attacked, panic-stricken little child; moments later, the patient may experience himself as the stern, prohibitive, moralistic (and extremely sadistic) primitive mother image, while the therapist is seen as the guilty, defensive, frightened but rebellious little child." Of course I was not his therapist, and he not my patient, but the dynamic was obviously the same. Knowing the family history of my ex, this excerpt explained to me what was behind several years of misery and confusion for me and over forty years of the same for him. On page 124, Dr. Kernberg explains a "teasing" characteristic which, in my relationship, had me completely puzzled and frustrated: "...a patient with serious masochistic trends and rationalization of failure as being always the fault of another's aggression or of fate, and who, at the same time, presents rather sadistic behavior with a teasing quality under certain circumstances, is not disturbed at all when confronted with the contradiction between such teasing behavior and his tendency to complain about how he is being mistreated by others; the tolerance of such contradictions within established behavior patterns is a severe prognostic sign." The book is filled with similar gems of understanding, which, if you have been the victim of a narcissist, will explain so many long unanswered questions. An excellent book, you will emerge a person of clearer understanding for having read it. Just remember that an explanation of the origins of abusive behavior is not an excuse for such behavior, and that your chief (perhaps only) duty is to protect yourself from your abuser, without regard for the origins or reasons for the abuse.

Kay Redfield Jamison tells the story of her battle with bipolar disorder with amazing candor. This book is hard to put down because Jamison is so clearsighted and analytical about the effects of her condition on her life. "An Unquiet Mind" reads like literature. Jamison is a very evocative and poetic author. The book will also make you think. Jamison writes of a conversation in which she and a colleague each chart their family histories of depression and suicide. Jamison's family is full of such history on her father's side. Then, in her acknowledgements, Jamison thanks her family for their help and support. As she lists the members of her family, it is interesting and amusing that almost every member carries the title "doctor". This brings to mind another book I recently read entitled "In My Blood" by John Sedgewick. Mr. Sedgewick comes from a family similarly blessed and cursed by bipolar disorder. In the book he traces the heights of success and creativity to which the members of his family have soared, as well as the depths of despair and destruction. If you read "An Unquiet Mind" and are fascinated by this pattern, you should try Mr. Sedgewick's book too.

I really, really love Ann Rule. "Without Pity" is a collection of 12 short cases, three new, the rest reruns from her earlier books. I personally like her long books that contain one story, such as "Small Sacrifices", or the True Crime Files volumes which contain one book-length story supplemented by a few shorter stories, such as "Last Dance, Last Chance". But if you have read her longer works, and can't get enough of Ann Rule, the three new stories in this book alone will be worth the price of admission. If you have not read Ann Rule's earlier books, the older stories are all very interesting ones too.

Don't make this the first book you read by Ann Rule. This book lacks everything that makes her such a great writer. The Green River Killer case went unsolved for many years, and there was a huge amount of speculation about who had done it. When it was finally solved, I hoped Ann Rule would write a book about it. I thought it would be as great as "The Stranger Beside Me". The day I received the book (I managed to get an advance copy) I ripped the wrapping off with great excitement. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with the reading experience. It was like getting a big box of your favorite kind of chocolates, only to discover this particular box doesn't taste too great. I had a very hard time keeping track of the victims. It's not just that there were so many of them, but they also lived very similar disfunctional lives, which really made them blend together. Rule made it worse by putting so much effort and verbage into trying to humanize the victims and their families, because the reader was forced to put a corresponding amount of effort into matching up the photos with the names, or any other tool to try to keep the victims straight. I know that compassion for the victim is a hallmark of Rule's writing. Sometimes from a literary perspective her portrayal of the victims as saints weakens her books and strains the reader's belief, but I have always thought it showed Rule had a good heart. In this case, it seriously detracted from the book. Her characterization of Gary Ridgeway also seems strangely flat. Sometimes lack of affect is a major part of a killer's personality, and this may explain the emptiness and lack of humanity the reader feels in the characterization.

If you have not yet read "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" I envy you because you get to read it for the first time. It is one of the great books of our time. It is very complex and contains really effective symbolism, yet it is also very, very down-to-earth. If you are 12, or 22, or 32, or 92, this book will be full of meaning to you. It is about the death of the small town, a troubled family, individualism, and many other themes. It is simply one of the best, if not the best, book I have ever read. The movie is also excellent.

Although the books I have read by him were written fifty years ago or even more, his personality just shines through in his writing. He travelled all over the world, and happened to be on hand for the discovery of King Tut's tomb. He wrote really fascinting books on his travels in Italy, Spain, and England. In a way Morton reminds me of Kennith Clark, the historian who saved all the cultural treasures during WWII. He was so well-travelled, cultured, and intelligent, and had such a gift for describing people and places. His books on the cities of Rome and London are especially wonderful. Morton obviously loved imagining the history of the ancient cities. "In Search of London" is so interesting because in one sentence he writes about his personal recollections of the blitz, then he's going on about the Roman occupation of London. If you liked Edward Rutherford's books about England you will get a thrill reading H.V. Morton's books.

This book does contain a lot of information, and I think it gives the reader an idea about what life is like on the Appalachian Trail. But I didn't have that much fun reading it. I really get into reading a hiker's account of their own physical and spiritual journey, and their impressions of nature and their fellow man, and this wasn't that kind of book. I wish more through hikers would write their own story. I am always so happy when I find another such book to read. My favorite so far has been "Walking Home" by Kelly Winters. I am going to look up "Wild Bird Song", suggested by an earlier reviewer, right away!

I love the Stephanie Plum books so much, I was really hoping that "Metro Girl" would be as good. I agree with other reviewers who could live without "Nascar Guy". I thought he was rank. And the writing style that comes across as breezy in the Stephanie Plum books seems a little crass in "Metro Girl". Barney is not the likable character Stephanie is, and "Nascar Guy" is definitely not Morelli (or Ranger), but it wasn't the worst book I've ever read. I preferred it to the "Full" series by Evanovich, which I really didn't like.

This is a book about addiction and the binding power of abusive relationships. Martin's writing is gothic and atmospheric, but it would be a shame to read this book as a thriller, a romance, or a sermon on the evils of the class system in Victorian England and miss out on the main point of the book. What Martin is saying about substance abuse is that the addiction is not to getting high, or to enjoying the substance itself, the addiction is to letting out the inner beast. Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde are both present in all abusers, who use substances to let out the evil inside their souls (not to get rid of it, to enjoy using it). Mary's father used alcohol to let out his demons, and Dr. Jeckyl used his experiments. Women like Mary are bound to them by loyalty, family ties, and love. This is a very deep book and will make you think!

I think Ann Rule's best true-crime stories are not about serial killers who murder dozens of strangers (Green River Running Red), but rather those where the killer is someone close to the victim. This is the case with the collection "Last Dance, Last Chance". The main story is about a doctor who is a pathological narcissist who uses drugs, has affairs, and finally attempts to poison his wife, who stood by him through years of abuse. This story is one of Ann's best. It is not just that she tells a fascinating story, but also she makes many readers aware of the potential danger of those around us who regard us as prey, using charm, lies, and manipulation to further their own agendas. The doctor did not limit his harm to his own family. His acting skills and membership in the good old boys network of the medical community allowed the doctor to maim and even kill his patients through arrogance and carelessness. He did not have his medical license suspended for years, though he was gradually barred from operating at local hospitals. He got around this by setting up a surgical suite in his office, with no anesthesiologist and no provision for a medical emergency. More than any of Ann Rule's other books, this one made me think how the doctor recruited many other people to allow him to do so much harm. His wife, his chief victim, also his biggest enabler. She had to know he was committing medical malpractice, and even worked in his operating room with no medical qualifications so he would not have to pay someone qualified. His mother paid out huge amounts of money for his legal defense, and was manipulated into abandoning her daughter-in-law and grandchildren in favor of her lying son. Some other doctors stood by him to the end, claiming the legal system had no place in prosecuting a doctor who injured or killed his patients. He had several mistresses and toadies who copped drugs for him. All of these people were manipulated into supporting this malignant person, and I think there is a big lesson there for all of us.

The case of Sheila and Alan Blackthorne is very memorable and psychologically interesting. Ann Rule's readers know she is always kind to the victim and the victims family, but in this case her whitewashing of the victim's character strained credulity. I agree with an earlier reviewer who wrote that Sheila was irresponsible in getting pregnant with a man who physically and mentally abused her, stole every penny her parents had to live on, and who she even saw deliberately kill two motorcyclists. She stood silent while this man committed murder. She also seemed willing to live on the money he stole from others. Alan is a pathological narcissist, a personality disorder characterized by constant lying and rationalization, con-man activities, lack of empathy, and willingness to commit criminal acts. In spite of knowing what an evil and abusive man her husband Alan was, she stayed with him and had two babies with him. After years, she finally separated from Alan, but the two continued to battle in court over money and custody issues. Alan continued in his manipulative and controlling behavior. Sheila had gotten used to a more affluent lifestyle than she could earn by working, so she next married Jamie, another man who was also very nasty and abusive, though the author tried to portray him in a sympathetic light. Sheila repeated her earlier pattern of colluding with an abusive spouse as long as he is willing to support her. Money and security were more important to her than anything. She allowed her new husband to abuse and bully her own daughters. In her new incarnation she and her new husband were very "churchy", yet both of them physically abused the girls. Alan kept going to court to try to get custody of his daughters and using their daughters and others to spy on and harass Sheila. Then, even though her new family was in deep trouble, she underwent fertility treatments well known to result in multiple births. She was the kind of woman who viewed having children as a way of hanging on to her meal ticket. She ended up being portrayed in the local press as a hero for having quadruplets. The last thing this woman belonged doing was bringing even one more child into this troubled situation. After the quadruplets were born, the family secretly moved to Florida to get away from Alan. But Alan was not through with Sheila. This is a very engrossing, though also very long, book. If this book was interesting to you, there is an amazingly similar case written about in a book entitled "Sleeping With the Devil".

I have bought so many stupid gizmos off the tv that don't work, I sort of suspected that this would be one of them. It isn't. It works great! I have used it for chopping up vegetables for huge amounts of canning, and if it was going to break, get dull, or jam up, it would have by now. My favorite use for it is to use the fine dicer blade to make fresh salsa. It makes wonderful salsa! A tip for this: if you tip the device upside-down when chopping juicy tomatoes, the juice won't run all over and make a mess, it will go right in the container. This is one kitchen device that really works as well as they show on tv.

No matter how many true crime books you read, you will never, ever find another true crime writer to equal Ann Rule. She is intelligent, literate, and respects the reader. Although some of her books are better than others, her worst book outclasses anything else being written in the genre. Worth More Dead is not her best book, but it is still a great read!

Willie Morris was a truly great author! This story of his childhood with his dog was really heartwarming. It is so simple and warm and humorous, you will just love it. Warning: you will cry your eyes out at the end, but it's worth the pain. One of the best animal stories ever, I hope many kids read this in school. If you loved the movie "A Christmas Story" you will love this book. The movie version of "My Dog Skip" is also quite good, though it is kind of upsetting that in order to create drama the wonderful father of the book is kind of nasty in the movie. Willie Morris was a great author who also wrote a cat book entitled "My Cat Spit McGee" and several books about his life that remind me a little of Russel Baker's memoirs. One is entitled "North Toward Home", another "Good Old Boy" and one is about life in New York City.

I loved this book. It is set in Pennsylvania, and revolves about an ordinary young woman who inherits an ordinary little house in an ordinary little community. I could really relate to this nice woman who loves her new house, with a climbing rose growing up the porch and a creek in back. She begins an instant friendship with the woman next door, adopts the ugly dog that has been hanging around, and meets two eligible bachelors who seem interested in her. The only problem is that someone seems to be coming in her house and searching for something, and then things start getting worse. Meg is really great: a very practical, good-natured woman for the heroine of a thriller. The dialogue is a little arch and breezy for real life, but other than that, I consider this the perfect suspense book.

I read through this book in a long afternoon, finding it totally engrossing. The story is about a young girl growing up under the roof of her grandfather, an intellectual vicar who led a double life of sex and booze, and her grandmother, an angry, disappointed anti-intellectual diabetic who lived for the treats of going to movies, candy, and scented soaps. The two detested each other, and their daughter wore herself out and sacrificed her personality to keep the household going in a very marginal way. The daughter had a daughter of her own, the author of this memoir, Lorna Sage. I don't think the point of this story is that her life was a nightmare, though it was hardly happy. It was about how, as humans, we all just keep making messes of our lives, generation after generation, and we all have our own family history and genetics which determine our strengths and our devastating flaws. Lorna inherited her grandfather's "bad blood", along with his use of books to escape both the place he was in (an isolated, wet, postwar depressed backwater), and the mess he was actively making of his life. In the middle of this mess, Lorna used this gift to survive, and even to struggle out of the quagmire by getting an advanced education.

While reading this book, I found myself compelled to read parts aloud to my husband: about where tumbleweed came from, facts about different Indian tribes, Bonnie and Clyde, Crazy Horse, and "In Cold Blood". I found the book totally fascinating, and I learned many things I never thought of even wondering about before. This is the first book I have ever read by Ian Frazier, and I will now look for his other books, he's a very interesting author.

If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, you will probably like Tender at the Bone and its sequel, Comfort Me With Apples. Reading this book is a journey and an adventure, and the reader comes away feeling like they have met a fascinating new friend. If you are interested in travel, food, restaurants, or growing up with a mentally ill parent, you must read these two books!

If you can't wait for the next Janet Evanovich book, you will love Bubbles. Although a totally different character than Stephanie Plum, both sets of books have the same wacky sense of humor and love of family and community. The authors even know each other, the librarian told me that "Bubbles" was born at Janet Evanovich's kitchen table!

With it's beautiful, extremely close-up color photos, this book about hummingbirds looks like a coffee table book. But I was very surprised and pleased upon reading the text that this is really a very serious book that will answer literally any hummingbird question you might have. Some of the questions I had about hummingbirds were: do hummingbirds eat anything but nectar? why do we only have ruby-throated hummingbirds east of the Rocky Mountains? how old do hummingbirds live to be? do all hummingbirds migrate? do male hummingbirds aid in raising the babies? do they migrate in flocks? Not only are all these questions and many more answered, there was a chapter about migration that started with a baby hummingbird born in northern New York state, and followed him to his winter home in Argentina. I was amazed at how quickly the tiny bird could make it from NY to VA, and then, the suspense of how he could possibly fly across the Gulf of Mexico- obviously no place to rest, and no food available. If, like me, you have had long unanswered questions about hummingbirds, this is the ideal book. I would think it would be great to read parts of this book and look at the beautiful pictures with older children, too.

The scenery and buildings were beautiful and exotic. Beautifully filmed. Richard Burgi was very scenic as well (such a handsome actor!), but the plot did not do credit to the beauty of the location and the male and female leads, who I feel did their best with what they had to work with. Even with the high-quality eye-candy, the movie dragged. It just got boring.

This is such a great, great movie. Shrek is such a wonderful hero, I am absolutely in love with him. I was so disappointed by the message of the Disney movie "Beauty and the Beast". I kept telling myself all the way up to the end of the movie that the Beast would NOT HAVE TO change into a handsome prince for he and Belle to be happy together. What a lost opportunity to teach a life lesson! I must have been just waiting for Shrek to come along. It is just such an exciting, joyous, wonderful, music-filled movie. The music was epic. There were a lot of great lessons here: loyalty, values, courage, learning that handsome is as handsome does... Also so funny, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life, I literally had tears running down my face. And Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots! How much cooler can you get?

This book may not be a great work of literature, but it has a lot of suspense and will keep the reader guessing until the last page. It is the book equivalent of a scary movie- the kind where you keep telling the heroine "don't go down in that basement", "don't go up in that attic", "don't walk down that alley", but of course she always does. I really like a scary story, but it seems like most are either romance novels in disguise or so shallow I lose track of which character is which and I am not quite sure what state the events are taking place in. Anders supplies plenty of detail and just enough character development. I like something thrilliing, scary, and not too demanding to read on a cold, rainy evening curled up on the couch, and "Dead Silence", while not perfect, is just about right.

Two buddies from Southern Michigan decide to join family and friends at their traditional deer camp up north. At last minute, they take a detour and head east for Mio, to drink, party and raise hell. There were a few sightings in the Mio area: they asked directions of a local homeowner, and they were seen at a few bars. Then nothing. But over the years rumors kept circulating that they had crossed paths with the Duvall brothers. The Duvalls lived in squallor, migrating between occasional factory jobs in Southern Michigan and raising pigs and selling wood and committing petty larceny in Northern Michigan. The locals lived in fear of the Duvalls. State Policeman Bronco Lesneski spent years tracking down the sources of rumors about the Duvalls' involvement in the disappearance. This makes for a very creepy, atmospheric story about just how bad human beings can be.

You will want to read all three mysteries featuring Hannah Wolfe, a hip, intelligent young London private investigator. They are very well written and very up-to-date, not at all stodgey. In "Fatlands" Hannah is not happy about some demeaning jobs she gets through the detective agency, such as babysitting the wives of mideastern oil princes while they shop at Harrod's. When she has to escort a young girl named Mattie, the boring job becomes a big case leading Hannah to investigate strange happenings in the modern scientific hog raising industry. You won't be eating bacon or ham for a while after reading this mystery. Full of danger, romance, and a very original plot, this is a very exciting mystery, and you will just love Hannah Wolfe.

A few days after I finished reading "The Gift of Fear" I was standing in check out line at the library. The female librarian was dealing with a male customer who was not checking out a book. I overheard him using manipulative lines on the librarian right out of DeBecker's book! After he finally left, I asked the librarian if the man was bothering her. She said that he had been coming into the library for weeks, doing the same thing. She was an alert woman, and had taken a few precautions coming to and leaving work, and warned other library employees not to give the man any information about her, but was continuing to be harassed at her work by this man. I suggested that she read this book. When I thought about the situation, I realized how often I have observed and experienced disturbing men doing the exact behaviors in the book. One example of manipulation from the book that really sticks in my mind is the 40-year-old man who uses several gambits to engage a teenage girl on a plane in an inappropriate way. I won't go into details, but if you read this book, I think you will get a chill reading this passage, as I did. Another very thought-provoking section that hit home was about hiring and firing of employees. Mr. DeBecker's tips on proper hiring techniques and careful and considerate firing practices seem like common sense, but are seldom practiced in the work place. I am sure a lot of revenge situations are actually brought on by the victim insulting the troublesome individual and practically forcing him to retaliate. DeBecker's story of the harmless fan who was transformed into a horrific stalker was a perfect example. Although a little long, this book is both interesting and sure to be very useful.

Frances Mayes and her boyfriend Ed are college professors in San Francisco. Since her own college days, Mayes has rented houses in Italy, and dreamed of one day buying a home of her own in Tuscany. After looking at endless houses, ranging from ruins to the opposite extreme, they finally came upon Bramasole, a country home long abandoned and surrounded by terraced hillsides with old olive trees. As other reviewers pointed out, Mayes has a lot of money and whines about spending it. She does not become one of the locals, and when school starts she flies back to her apartment in California. But her descriptions of working on the house and the land around it really appeal to me. I enjoyed a story she told about rebuilding the falling stone walls with a team of Polish workers who worked for her contractor and stayed at the local church. She does love her new home and the land, and the layers of history she and Ed discover as they work on the house. She writes descriptions of the wonderful local produce and cooking, and you can feel the warmth of the sun, a visit to the weekly market, or the drama of a thunderstorm in her writing as if you were there.

The instructor I took field biology with in college highly recommended this book. He thought it was by far the best guide for identifying trees. Now, years later and having used (or attempted to use) many different field guides, I know why he was so crazy about this book. Winter or summer, if you are looking at the bark, leaf, or bud, the very clear and detailed pictures and unambiguous text will allow you to identify any tree with certainty.

I had to set this book aside several times because it was so painful to read. Connie May Fowler's story about her and her sister growing up as the daughters of an abusive alcoholic mother and their lives after their mother's death struck me as the most honest I have ever read. I could feel her hatred of living in an old travel trailer in Florida "like a blister...I wanted to pop it". Small details like her mother's purse having cockroaches in it are gritty and authentic. The girls had some relief from their situation early in childhood when they lived near the ocean. When the mother decided to move away from the sound of the waves, it almost seems deliberate, to eliminate any joy or hope from their lives. If anyone really wants to understand how it feels to grow up in poverty, they need to read this book. The details about eating beans, all the time, and the conditions in the apartment Connie and her mother moved into when Connie won a full scholarship to college all make me know that the author really experienced this. Her sister got married and got out, but starved herself of food even though she had escaped from her old life. Connie's mother died and Connie got a degree and was working as a bartender at Bennigan's, since an English degree is not as salable as an MBA. There she meets a washed-up radio personality who has burnt all of his bridges behind him. Connie's mother used to listen to his broadcast on the steps of the old travel trailer, and said if she were younger, she would marry that man. Connie, whose father died when she was young, thought she had found someone successful to guide and validate her. She fell for his con game and let him take over her life like a vampire. Connie's abuser was a textbook pathological narcissist. Jobless, impotent, and 30 years older than she, he found the perfect victim for his manipulation and bullying. I found myself actually crying out loud, "just leave him- run away". People who are successful and haven't been programed by their upbringing the way Connie was would have been able to leave as soon as the abuse began, but Connie's abuser was the exact mirror image of her mother. Before Connie's mother died in the hospital, she had to clean the hardened excrement off her mother. When Connie's new abuser drank while taking antabuse, she had to do the same for him. She was well trained for her role. The only love and success she knew was from a puppy named Katie she adopted and saved from the same poverty she had grown up with.

"A Scream on the Water" is the story of Thomas Maimoni, a narcissistic sociopath who lived a life of lies and abuse culminating in murder. This is a very well-written book. The setting is very well-developed. The descriptions of the people and places around Salem Mass. are well-rounded and satisfying. The reader feels as if they are there, and get inside the heads of the victim, her husband, the police investigators, and the wives of Maimoni and many other victims of his deceit and manipulation. For years Maimoni lied about everything to everyone: his marital status, military career (ha!), education, and jobs. This book is not only interesting to the true crime reader, it is like the works of Ann Rule in that the writer uses the opportunity to warn the innocent among us that people are often not as they present themselves. Even those who sensed that Maimoni was full of bull had no idea how explosive and deadly his rage could be when threatened with disclosure. A well-developed, psychologically complex, and thrilling cautionary tale.

This is a lavishly illustrated book of fairy tales. Tasha Tudor draws such sweet, loving illustrations of Thumbellina, Sleeping Beauty, Mr. Bun and all of the classic fairy tale characters children love. This would be a beautiful gift for a very young girl. Each story is well and simply told, and the pictures draw a child into the story and the experience of reading, or being read to. I know, it was one of the first books I ever owned, and read.

The child who gets the chance to read this book is lucky indeed, because they will be touched by magic. The story about the goldfish who fell in love with the moon was in one of my elementary school readers in the '60s, but I did not learn where it came from until I was about 12, when I discovered an original copy of this book from the '50s in my school library. I especially loved the stories of the Clumber Pup (I have learned there really is such a dog breed)and the boy who planted a kernel of corn from the pyramid. I got goosebumps when I first read "San Fairy Ann", and every time I re-read it the goosebumps come back. Eleanor Farjeon is the only author who has really captured for me the magic of time passing, and generations passing. I love to think that children are still changed for life by reading this book. I know I was.

"Classic Country: Honky Tonk Heroes" is a 2-cd set from Time Life Music. I really appreciate the huge "Classic Country" collection of cds which this is a part. It is really hard to find the great old country music songs. Honky Tonk is definitely a special niche within country music, sad songs about guys who spend way to much time in barrooms. The artists on this set are true greats: Hank Williams Sr., Webb Pierce, Red Foley, Buck Owens, Conway Twitty, and many others. Some of these songs will be familiar old favorites to fans of "Country Gold Saturday Night", such as "Crazy Arms" by Ray Price, "I Can't Stop Loving You" by Don Gibson, and "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights" by Freddy Fender. My husband, born during the Great Depression in a family of Okies and Arkies, absolutely loves these sad cheatin' songs, and even I got a kick out of hearing the original "Honky Tonk Man" by Johnny Horton which was remade by my favorite, Dwight Youkum.

I know from reading and talking with people in my hiking club that some people get very wound up about other hikers' journeys. When it comes to the Appalachian Trail, hikers who "blue blaze", hike non-official branches of the trail, or "yellow blaze", hitchhike, can drive some people to fits of rage. You can see this in some of the reviews of "A Walk in the Woods". Only a few hundred actually make it all the way from Georgia to Maine each year. Many more quit after a day or a week. I have read many books about hiking the Appalachian Trail, and an interesting aspect about these books is that many of the people who write about their hike do not make it to Maine, skip part of the trail, or take two seasons to complete their hike. Does this invalidate their experience? I still want to read about their hike. Bryson and his companion, Katz, had the guts and the optimism to set out on a 2000 mile journey on foot, two middle-aged, out of shape guys. While the book is very very funny and Bryson makes fun of everybody, including himself, there is a lot of adventure and learning about being human in the book. After reading "A Walk in the Woods", I had to read Bryson's other humorous books. An excellent and very funny author.

As with most really good books, there is more to this story than just the physical journey. It is also the story of a spiritual pilgrimage. Kelly Winters is an excellent writer, and her personal journey of discovery was perfectly balanced with the other aspects of hiking the trail: the physical challenges and dangers, companionship of all kinds of very different people, and the appreciation of nature. If you are going to read one book about the Appalacian Trail, this should be the one. You will feel like you are there with her.

There are only 12 tracks on this cd, so it is kind of a short one for the Time Life Music "Classic Country" series, and the cover art on the cd doesn't match the others in the series, but "Country Memories" is one of my very favorites in the series. Every song is not just good, but great. Really great. I was surprised to find one of my all-time favorites, a very rare song "This Ole House" by Stuart Hamblen on this cd. This is truly an awesome old country song, and there is a fascinating story about how it was written on the leaflet inside, along with some really interesting country music history. "I Can't Stop Loving You" by Don Gibson, "He'll Have To Go" by Jim Reeves, "Detroit City" by Bobby Bare, "Green Green Grass of Home" by Porter Wagoner, "Make the World Go Away" by Eddy Arnold- what more can I say?

If you like "Midsomer Murders" you will like the Inspector Barnaby books by Caroline Graham. The "Midsomer Murders" series is loosley based on Graham's mysteries. You will find the character of Sergeant Troy is quite different in the television show. He is much more likable. I enjoy both the books and the show. Some people are turned off by the character of Troy, and that makes them dislike the books. I think the people in the series are very human. Some are fine and admirable, some are dreary, some are condescending (this is England, after all), some are nazis and chauvenists. Just like real life. I think the "cozy" provides a sampler of characters in the charming setting of the English village, otherwise there would be no story. Just scenery. So don't hate the books just because Troy is repellant. It is kind of different to get inside the mind of someone not so nice. "Faithful Unto Death" is my favorite Inspector Barnaby book. It is quite complicated, and I very much like the characters in this book. It is very good "cozy" reading, and much more intellectual and complex than my other favorite, Agatha Raisin (by M.C. Beaton).

William Mcneill presents a different and mind-expanding take on disease: microbes, humans, and governments all function similarly to facilitate their optimal survival and expansion. When the opportunistic structure gets too greedy, it may overwhelm the host. With time and familiarity, host and parasite usually come to an uneasy alliance, which allows the survival of each. If you read "Plagues and Peoples" with this thesis in mind, it is a very interesting book. If you lose sight of the thesis, it is too easy to get bogged down in the author's extremely baroque writing style. A few reviewers concluded that the book was hard for them to comprehend because they were high school aged readers. As an older adult, compulsive reader, with a lot of patience, I have to say I experienced the same problem with this book. I checked the biographical material on the author to see if English was his second language. I felt the book read as if translated. I found myself mentally simplifying almost every sentence, not because of the complexity of the idea being conveyed, but because of unnecessary verbage. "Plagues and Peoples" does contain loads information on the history of mankind and disease, within the framework of an interesting thesis. I just feel that simpler wording would have helped the book read smoother. Another very fascinating history of man's interaction with microbes which is much more reader friendly is "Men and Microbes".

I have read several thrillers by Donna Anders. Reviewers frequently criticize her books, saying that they are like a Lifetime movie. This is true, but sometimes you just like to lock the doors, check in the closet and under the bed, and settle down to read a scary book, and aren't looking for a literary experience. "In All the Wrong Places" is just the kind of book I like to read on a rainy night around Halloween time. Viewers of QVC should really enjoy this book, because the main character is the host of a shopping channel. I just finished reading a thriller by Mary Higgins Clark, and found that the character development, plot, and fright level was not nearly as good as Donna Anders' books. If you want to be scared, this book is a great choice!

Usually when you love a book, you hate the movie, especially if the book is a great piece of literature. But in this case, I can't decide which I liked better. The casting for this movie was just perfect! I especially loved that the real-life Lady Chablis played the Lady Chablis in the movie, John Cusak's transgender friend. John Cusak was great as the author of the story, John Berendt, and Kevin Spacey was just as great as the antiques dealer on trial for murder. The scenery and homes of Savanah were integral to the book, and they came across beautifully in the movie. It was just wonderfully done. It is a very funny movie that is also very deep and beautiful. You really have to watch this movie. You also really must read the book, they are both way too good to miss!

I have read several books by Donna Anders, and this is the best one yet. All of her books are thrilling and scary, but as another reviewer noted, this one seems better written. Rather than an elaborate techno-plot, this is the story of an abused wife who takes her little boy and starts a new life, only to find danger in her new life too. The husband in this book uses all the tools of a pathological narcissist, "gaslighting" his wife to make her unsure of herself, and using a gullible doctor and neighbor to establish a history of instability. For readers who have never experienced or witnessed such activities, the plot seems farfetched, but to those who have dealt with a narcissist it is all too realistic. The author creates characters who are more three-dimensional than you find in most thrillers, and the settings for the book are very detailed and realistic. I thought it was a very good thriller.

There are very few good books on personality disorders. Narcissistic personality disorder ruins many lives, yet there is so little written about the subject. If you have been involved with a narcissist, you absolutely must read this book. It is amazing to me that individual narcissists are so very similar to each other! When you read about the experiences of other victims of narcissists you will see that all narcissists are locked into the same pattern. The things you found unbelievable in your own life have happened to many others, and you will be empowered by learning to "know your enemy". The best lesson of this book is that your narcissist does not love you, he does not love your replacement, he does not love anyone. He is only using "love" as a manipulative tool. I hope this book will help you escape with your sanity intact.

I have loved Tasha Tudor's illustrations in books like "The Tasha Tudor Book of Fairy Tales", "The Secret Garden" and "A Little Princess" since childhood. I didn't know anything about Tasha Tudor as a person, and then one Christmas my mother gave me this book. Wow! Mrs. Tudor has lived a remarkable life and she is an amazing person. She has chosen to create a home for herself that seems to exist in a century past. Her son built a rustic house for her, and she has surrounded it with extensive farm buildings, cottage gardens, fruits, berries, chickens, goats and dogs. She dresses in layers of vintage clothing and eats off of china that has been in her family for generations. I just love this woman, and her lifestyle. This is a beautiful book.

I have read all of Donna Anders' thrillers. When I see a new title by this author, I know the book will be exciting, a scary book to read on a cold, rainy night. I was troubled by the heroine in this book, though. She was responsible for the welfare of two teenaged daughters, yet took very few practical steps to protect them or herself from a very violent stalker targeting the family. Several women had been murdered on the jogging path behind her house and she and one of her daughters were lured to the secluded path and then shot at. Then, when she had very obviously incriminating evidence in a murder investigation, she withheld the information from the police, waiting for the suspect to explain his side of the story to her. Even when his name was printed in the newspaper as a suspect, she continued to withhold evidence. In her other books, Anders keeps the fear and anxiety level up without sacrificing the integrity of her heroine. "Night Stalker" is scary and suspenseful, but I didn't enjoy it as much as her other books.

If you are looking for a beautiful book full of ideas for perennial garden design, this is it. The book is full of great color pictures of absolutely gorgeous famous gardens. Although few of us have the space, time or money to have our own gardens of the size and caliber we see in this book, many of the ideas can be applied to the home garden. Not just a juicy coffee table book, both the text and photos offer much for those looking for inspiration about perspective, backdrop, texture, and all the elements of garden design.

This is a very well written book. It is a very sad true story of child abuse by adoptive parents. At the time of 3-year-old Dennis Jurgens' death, most child abuse cases were not prosecuted. Barry Siegel skillfully tells the story of how Dennis' birth mother stirred up interest in his death, just when people were becoming more aware of child abuse cases and physical abuse started to be prosecuted. The story of the town of White Bear Lake is intrinsic to the story. The adoptive parents, Harold and Lois Jurgens, got married in the small town after WWII, in a community of young families geared toward the mother staying home and raising kids. In the postwar suburban world of mom and apple pie, a woman abusing her kids was unimaginable. Lois' brother was a force to be reckoned with in the City Police. He managed to intimidate many who knew the bad things that went on in the suburban home of Harold and Lois. The Jurgens could not have children of their own, but managed to adopt in spite of Lois' history of mental problems. Reading about the hell the adopted children went through is very difficult and affecting. The first child the Jurgens adopted grew up to be a police officer, and his role in the story is very interesting. This is a very sad, very well-written book, one you won't be able to put down.

After reading "Italian Days" I feel as if I actually know Barbara Harrison. I enjoyed reading about the travels of someone of my own age and sex, who notices and enjoys the same things as I would if I were lucky enough to make a trip to Italy. She generously reveals much of herself in her writing. Through her stories, I also feel as if I have experienced Italy, tasted the food, crowds in Rome, natural beauty, art, architecture and people. The book is thick and full of sensuous detail. Reading it made me hungry for the wonderful food she described.

The trapper Link and his snow dog Chiri are my favorite characters in books by Jim Kjelgaard. Link and Chiri are both natural loners who are steadfast and competent in the far northern wilderness. Chiri's mother is a big pack dog that Link had just bought. Her first litter of puppies had been killed on the trail by a cruel master. With a new litter on the way, she cleverly runs away and bears her three puppies in a windfall in the territory of a fierce black wolf that hates man and dog alike, having been shot early in life. Chiri is the biggest and most promising of her pups, and the only one who escapes from the black wolf. His mother and siblings dead, the lonely pup learns survival by necessity, and being a superior animal, becomes a strong and able hunter. The trapper Link is also strong and competent, but like the orphaned dog, he is lonely. He has dreamed of having a special dog who can be his companion in the wilderness. How he tames the great dog and together they live in nature, experiencing beauty and danger, and hunger and plenty, should make dog lovers and nature lovers of any young person who reads the book. There is a sequel that is just as good, maybe better, entitled "Wild Trek". If you liked these two books of adventure in the north, you would also like "Lost in the Barrens" and "Curse of the Viking Grave" by Farley Mowat.

If you love the north country and the outdoors, and haven't read this book yet, you have a great adventure coming! It doesn't really matter if you are very young or very old, you can enjoy this book because it is so well written. I first read this book as a ten-year-old girl, and loved it. I still re-read it as a middle-aged woman, and I still love it! Every time I read this, I want to escape to Canada to go hiking and canoeing (and often I do). The details of outdoor survival are all authentic. The adventure aspects are as thrilling as anything I have ever read. There are lessons to this story, and they aren't shallow. These boys make some mistakes, take their knocks, and learn lessons that make them into real, responsible men. A great aspect of this book is that the moral is not to avoid mistakes, but to do what has to be done once the mistakes are made, and grow by making them. The two Indian tribes, the Eskimos, and the white people all have their own fears of "foreign" people and their territories. The boys encounter their fear of the unknown, physical danger, and of unknown people and surmount them by being steadfast. The sequel to this book, The Curse of the Viking Grave is also really good. If you enjoyed reading this book you might also enjoy "The Old Man and the Boy" by Robert Ruark.

This is one of the funniest books I have ever read! "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole" will strike a chord with any adolescent or anyone who has ever been an adolescent. Even though Adrian is a character from the '80s, his book is still very fresh and rib-crackingly hilarious. This is two books in one. You also get the second Adrian Mole book, "The Growing Pains of Adrain Mole". If you read the "Secret Diary", read the "Growing Pains" to see what happens to Adrain next. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!

This is the second Stephanie Plum book. Could it be as good as "One for the Money"? Yes! Stephanie's back, and so are her mom, dad, grandma, Morelli, and all the others that made the first book so great! Stephanie is coming into her own in this book. She's working on collecting the bounty on a guy who shot a mechanic in the knee. Then, the mechanic turns up dead. Stephanie is gaining confidence in her job as a bounty hunter. She's even offered a side job by the sleazy funeral director, Spiro. This is a great story. You'll love it!

Probably my all-time favorite during my early teens, this book has non-stop action. A teenaged boy goes to help his uncle run a secluded motel. There is something very strange about the first customer he checks in. When he takes him some towels, all heck starts breaking loose. Soon he is on the lam, driving his uncle's old Hudson, cradling a rifle, and staring down the nose of a Mack truck driven by a blue alien from outer space! Wow!!!!

Leslie Mass hiked the Appalachian Trail at 60. Her book is one of my favorite accounts of hiking the Appalachian Trail. She is a college administrator, wife and mother who managed to fit a flip-flop hike into her work schedule. Since childhood, Mass had been told to speak softly and accomodate herself to others. On her hike she learned to value her own opinion and one of life's biggest lessons: sometimes it is not so bad to be alone and hike your own hike. She made elaborate plans to hike parts of the trail with friends and family. You can tell that she was very accustomed to being close to other people, part of a very social world. In spite of this, she writes that she always knew she was an introvert. Her biggest lesson from the trail was to trust in herself, rather than going along with someone else who forced her into the role of "follower". On the trail, she made friends with several other hikers, one of whom took way too much interest in Mass' daughter, Amy, before even meeting her. He basically took over Mass' hike, and made her miserable. When Amy joined her mother on the trail, he attached himself to her. He didn't seem to be the most stable character, even making remarks about which man hiking the trail Mass had selected for her daughter. Creepy. I hope nothing bad came of this. Dog lovers might get some negative vibes: Mass obviously HATES dogs!

My three favorite books about growing up, "My Dog Skip", "The Old Man and the Boy", and this book, "Growing Up" by Russell Baker, were all written by newspaper and magazine journalists with Southern roots. There must be some southern storytelling tradition that turns out writers of great memoirs. This is a charming book, full of love of family, humor, and growing up during the difficult history of the depression. I have read and re-read this book, and always find something to laugh about or something that touches me deeply. I expected the reviews of this book to be all five-star accolades, and I am shocked and alarmed by the several reviewers who found the book "boring" and "repetitive". I can't help but wonder what comprises excitement in such readers' lives.

This is THE book to read about the psychopath. My experience with psychology books is that those written for the layman err on the side of seeming condescending, and contain only the most superficial of information. Books written for professional use are not very readable, and usually contain reams of material on the treatment of the condition. This book contains huge amounts of information, and does not sensationalize or focus on the "serial killer", yet is highly readable. Dr. Hare is obviously a great authority on psychopathy, and manages to educate the reader, with no temptation to "skip pages". What a great book!

If you bake heavy bread doughs or large batches, this is the mixer for you. I had a slightly smaller Kitchen Aid mixer, which I also loved, but the extra size and motor power of this model is invaluable. It is a beautiful machine. It is heavy and quiet, and very powerful, like an expensive luxury automobile. It is also very beautiful, I have it in red, and it is just gorgeous with my red le creuset pans (they have the exact same color and finish). It has a very useful feature where it starts out slow when you first turn it on, then gradually speeds up. This keeps things from slopping out of the mixing bowl. There are three things I do not especially like about this mixer, but you will notice I give the machine 5 stars anyway. The first problem is really minor. It takes some degree of coordination to get the bayonet at the back of the mixing bowl attached to the mixer. The other two problems stem from the top of the mixer not swinging up, as it does on the smaller mixers. Using the plastic chute accessory to load ingredients is a bother, so I soon stopped doing that. When I put ingredients into the bowl, it is kind of an awkward, messy procedure. Then, when you finish mixing, it is also awkward to get the beater out of your food product. If something were to happen to the machine I own, these problems would not keep me from buying the same exact machine again. For people who cook large batches, this mixer is just wonderful. If you don't really need the volume, you would be happier with one of the smaller mixers, the top of which swing up.

"Return to Gone Away Lake" is the sequel to "Gone Away Lake" which I discovered many years ago, when I was about 10. I just loved them as a kid, and re-reading them 30 years later I find I enjoy them almost as much as I did back then. What a great way to while away a summers day, reading these wonderful adventures. In this sequel, Minnehaha has revealed that there is a safe hidden in the kids' new house at Gone Away Lake. This is wholesome, adventurous, and very fun reading for any kid or kid at heart. Great to read aloud, too.

I really enjoyed this book. When I was young, and reading "Puck of Pook's Hill" and "Rewards and Fairies" for the first time, I laboriously wrote out a timeline of English history. It is so hard to place individual happenings and people into perspective with a history so long and eventful. I think Edward Rutherfurd did an amazing job in telling the story of a beloved place from prehistoric times to modern times through the descendents of five historic families. A person can look at things from so many perspectives, and the most natural, I suppose, is individual. That's why some readers prefer a long, detailed story about one character. But Rutherfurd is writing about a land he loves, and a people. Our lives are fleeting, just as are the stories of the individual lives in "Sarum". But the land, and the spirit of the people that live their lives there, and build buildings, lives on through generations. I think that is what is being told to us by writers like Rutherfurd, and also Patricia Wright in "I am England" and "That Near and Distant Place" and Rudyard Kipling in "Puck of Pook's Hill" and "Rewards and Fairies". The story of the individual is short and sweet, and echoes forward through time. If we take time and listen carefully, we can hear the voices of our ancestors in the buildings they built, the land they plowed, an inscription in a stone, or a carving.

I could not read this book all the way through. The vampire, vampire, vampire thing was carried WAY too far. There is a real need for a book on personality disorders written for the layman, but this book appears to have been written with a second grader in mind. As a matter of fact, many second graders would probably feel insulted by the condescending way the author addresses his audience.

When I was very young, my first book was "The Tasha Tudor Book of Fairy Tales". I loved the sweet watercolor illustrations of the classic fairy tale stories. It was obvious that Mrs. Tudor loved dogs and foxes and Puss in Boots, and the flower illustrations that surround the text are so perfect and true-to-life! As an older child, I was surprised to find that Tasha Tudor had also illustrated my editions of "The Secret Garden" and "A Little Princess". When, as an adult, I received the book "Tasha Tudor's Garden" as a gift from my mother, I realized that the illustrator lives just as wonderful a life as what she portrays in her illustrations. Now, in "Tasha Tudor's Heirloom Crafts" the reader can find out more about Mrs. Tudor's unique life, a re-creation of the simple and beautiful way of life of the 1800s. There are beautiful photos of Mrs. Tudor carding and weaving and making her own cosmecuticals from the products of her own plants and animals. This is not a how-to book, but a book of inspiration for those of us who love the idea of doing for ourselves and living closer to the land.

This book is originally from the 1950s. In the '60s, my dad came home with an old used copy he got at a garage sale. It became my favorite book when I was very young. It has great color illustrations. It is realistic, not anthromorphic. Nothing in here that would not be of interest to a real live chipmunk. Some of the pictures are just beautiful, and very naturalistic. The book tells the life story of Chipmunk Willie, how he builds his house, hibernates, finds food, finds a mate, raises children, some of whom are killed by predators. I have never come across a book for young children that deals so realistically with nature. There are some scarey parts that are dealt with in a kind of matter-of-fact manner. I gave a copy to a 6-year-old friend, but I made sure to tell her that the book had some things about Chipmunk Willy being hunted by scarey animals and his children even being killed, but that the book is about the circle of life, so it is just nature. As I did at her age, she just loves the book.

Marlena De Blasi was a chef and food writer of a certain age. She was in Venice when she met a Venitian banker who fell in love with her at first sight and set about winning her heart. In reading this book, the cautious part of me kept on wanting to tell the author to back off, rent an exotic apartment in Venice, and really get to know her "Stranger" before selling her home and leaving her whole life in the U.S. behind. Another part of me wanted her to go for it, even though the chances were she would end up with a broken heart and no home to run to. De Blasi has so much enthusiasm, about food and life and beauty, that the reader feels like they are being told the story by a girlfriend over lunch. I especially love her detailed descriptions of the street market she discovers in her new home. Of course I could not help but feel forboding when she discovers the banker's home is a charmless apartment in a nasty concrete building, and when his tendency toward depression and bullying start to show themselves. But as Nicholas Cage said in the movie "Moonstruck", maybe we are meant to fall in love with the wrong people and make fools of ourselves. I look forward to reading more about De Blasi's adventures in Italy.

If you can, read Marlena De Blasi's earlier book "A Thousand Days in Venice" before reading this one. I was glad I knew about De Blasi's life in the U.S. and Venice, and how she met and married her "Stranger" as she calls her Venetian husband Fernando. Fernando has a tendency to melancholy and melodrama. He feels trapped by his past of unhappiness and his stifling job in a bank. Marlena is horrified when he comes home and announces that he has quit his secure, life-long job. She's a city girl, in love with Venice, and he has decided to move to a rural Tuscan village. But Marlena is also adaptable and adventurous, and makes the most of the beautiful Tuscan countryside, amazing food experiences (she is a former chef and food writer), and people who embrace her and make her feel welcome. I expected a book like "Under the Tuscan Sun", where the writer has buckets of money and views the locals as humorous bumpkins and overpriced servants, but De Blasi becomes close to the natives of her new home and learns about the privations of their past and the sorrows of their present (the subtitle of the book is "A Bittersweet Adventure"). She falls in love with the "Duke", who was born in the building her new apartment is in and who remembers the hunger of the war years. He takes the younger couple under his wing and teaches them the lessons that go with the food De Blasi loves: during the hungry periods, chestnuts were all the Tuscans had to eat. They ground the shells for coffee, and made a paste of the nutmeats and water, and baked it into cakes. There was no olive oil, honey, or cream to make it sumptuous. Soldiers returning to their home were not feted by their families with the roasting of the fatted calf, but with starvation. They ate the grass. Marlena reveals that money is tight for her and Fernando, $75.00 per week must cover everything. There is worry in the winter as the woodpile is depleted too quickly, and the bread is set to rise under the bedcovers, the only warm place in the house! They harvest grapes and olives with their new friends, learn to prepare wild boar, and learn to love the land. If you love food and travel, read this book!

It is not possible to have a satisfying relationship with a narcissistic partner. If you are in a relationship with a narcissist, you need to leave, immediately. You are in a psychologically abusive relationship which could turn physically abusive at any time. Narcissists do not love their victims. They only love themselves. They are great liars and con artists who use the pretense of "love" to get what they want. If you know that he is a narcissist, it is because you have found out his secret and know him for the liar that he is. You have already had your heart broken by his lying, cheating, substance abuse, con-man activities, and total lack of respect for you as a human being. He may renew the act for a while, persuading you to put your life on hold yet again. If you can get away before he takes all your money, self-respect, and even your friends from you you are lucky. Face it, the longer you stay, the harder it will be when you finally manage to leave, or, even more hurtful, your narcissist leaves you for a better source of narcissistic supply. If you have children with a narcissist he will use them against you, and they will grow up victims of his manipulations and lies. The longer you stay, the more you lose. Do not take the undignified and harmful advice offered in this book!

This movie has some really good scary moments. I loved seeing the great old actors who played the Chowder Society getting a chance to be in a movie together, and I loved the scenery and atmosphere of the New England village. The premise was really good and had some substance to it. Frankly, there are so few horror movies that are anything other than pathetic that I was really glad to find one this good. I really can't become absorbed in movies about a bunch of scantily-clad teenagers being chased around generic locales by guys in masks. "Ghost Story" doesn't have the symbolism and meaning of "The Shining", but it is definitely worth watching.

One reviewer used the term "workmanlike" to describe the writing in this book, another describes it as "plodding". These are both good descriptions of how I felt about the reading experience. This is definitely not a sensational blood-and-guts type of true crime book. It is a detailed and methodical account of a police investigation. It left me wanting more insight into the psychological makeup of con-man, bigamist, and murderer Richard Overton. This is another book I wish had been written by my favorite true crime author, Ann Rule, because she delves into the criminal's past and psyche. This book is written from a cop's point of view, and saying repeatedly that Overton was a "piece of work" is about as psychologically complex as it gets. The book is, however, very clear and well-written in a very straightforward way.

The Golden Evenings of Summer is one of my all-time favorite books. It is very funny, filled with nostalgia, and a great family book. Anyone who enjoyed the movie "A Christmas Story" or the humor of Jean Shepherd will really love this book. This would be great for a grandparent to read with their grandchild.

If you love a man who loves himself, you really need to read this book. W. Keith Campbell has written a very informative and useful book for women who find themselves involved with a narcissist. It is refreshing to read a book about narcissism by an author who is actually an expert on the subject. Although the book is written for the everyday reader, the author does not "write down" or condescend to his audience. I really like the title the author chose, because rather than the term "narcissism", he chose to use the defining characteristic of narcissism "a man who loves himself". I picture someone in just the situation I was in a few years ago, with no clue what narcissism is, looking through relationship books trying to make sense of the strange thing that was going on in her life, and picking up this book. Before I discovered what narcissim was, I wasted my time reading relationship books like "Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them", which did not help me figure out that my significant other had a severe personality disorder. I, like many others in a relationship with a pathological narcissist, was being conned out of money, cheated on and gaslighted, made to think that I was crazy for suspecting such a handsome and intelligent man was lying to me. If you are dealing with a narcissist, you need to read this book. Thank you Mr. Campbell.

This book could save your sanity, bring you some degree of peace with your past, or possibly prevent you or the ones you love from making a very bad mistake in the future. This book is not a thin, superficial "pop psyche" book, and cannot be compared to anything else that has been written about narcissism or any other personality disorder. Every day we read books and see television shows and movies about serial killers, but what we really need to fear in everyday life are people with personality disorders. The narcissist will seduce you, then abuse you and rob you blind while charming everyone around you. Everyone will love him, and he will convince even your friends and family that it is you who have gone crazy. If you have crossed paths with a "pathological liar", "gigalo" or "con man", he was, without doubt, a narcissist. Hardly anyone knows much about narcisisstic personality disorder until they go through the living hell of a relationship with a narcissist, and has to do research to find out what the heck happened to them. This book will explain everything you have gone through, and hopefully convince you not to try to remain in the relationship.

When Bruce Moilanen, the husband of the murder victim, sets up an appointment for a private lie-detector test, I yelled at my husband "Bob Dufort is in this book!". Dufort was a retired state police officer who became a private detective and polygrapher in Northern Michigan. One time when he was showing me his polygraph machine I asked him to explain what seemed to be a lapse in logic, and he looked me in the eye and told me the polygraph worked because he had been a state trooper for twenty some years, and HE could tell when someone was lying. So much for the polygraph machine. I really enjoyed reading a bizarre and interesting story that took place in the Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The Distels did a good job conveying the way of life in the UP during hunting season. The story itself is great fodder for a true-crime book, featuring a really strange husband-from-hell, which always makes for addictive reading. Although this book is of local interest, I would rate it right up there with the best true-crime writing.

Please be aware that this is not the same as the heavy Le Creuset clad cast-iron pots. It is lightweight and inexpensive, which has its good side, since a 12-quart cast iron stockpot would be too heavy to lift, plus terribly expensive. It looks good on the counter, and it is ok for some things (it is big enough to make a double batch of jam without boiling over, and it is good for boiling a whole lot of corn on the cob). If you are cooking anything that might stick or scorch, do not use this pan! In spite of being treated very delicately, the bottom of my two pans quickly became badly scratched up. This is not the pan you want if you are making a big pot of clam chowder, because it will surely scorch and stick to the bottom of the pan.

If you are the victim of a narcissist in the first stages of learning about narcissism there are several excellent books available about this disorder that will be much more readable and more helpful to you. It is important that you not make this the one book you read on the subject. The very best book is by Sam Vaknin, who wrote a review of Lowen's book on Amazon. Vaknin's book is entitled "Malignant Self Love". Vaknin pulls no punches in telling the victim of the narcissist the facts of life: your narcissist does not love you, never has and never will. Things will not get better. Get out before you are abused further. Vaknin does not hold out false hopes that therapy will make it all better. Although of course all narcissists are not the same, their treatment of others ALWAYS follows very specific, very destructive patterns. Narcissists specialize in using lies and false encouragement to get others to do their bidding, and a narcissist is perfectly capable of going to therapy, manipulating the therapist, and using the experience to feed the disorder, not cure it. Lowen's work, on the other hand, seems to center on the narcissist as the victim of the disorder, minimizing the destruction caused to people in the narcissist's life. For that reason might be more encouraging and helpful to the narcissist himself, as opposed to the narcissist's family. There is good information in this book about the origins of the disorder. So if you are the narcissist, read this book. I'm sure it will help you to understand your disorder. If you are the victim of a narcissist, please don't take Lowen's book as a sign that you should stay with a narcissist and think the condition is treatable. Personality disorders are almost impossible to treat.

"The Sentinel" was such an awesome television show! Exciting plots, great explosions and car chases, and a wonderful cast, especially the stars, the so-handsome and ripped Richard Burgi and the amazingly cute Garret Maggert. I am so happy to be able to own the first season to re-watch whenever I want. The quality of this dvd set is excellent, the sound and picture quality are lovely, but there are no extras, which I have come to expect in sets such as this. I wish there was close-captioning, at the very least.Syfy channel is being stingy in their re-airing of this series, some episodes are skipped, and the ones they do show have scenes cut, so I am very eager for the release of the subsequent seasons on dvd. Please, please release season two soon!

"The Tarnished Eye" is set in a small town called Blessed, located north of Petoskey, Michigan, an area of big lakes bordered by gorgeous beaches, sand dunes, and forests. The subject matter is an unsolved multiple murder of a wealthy downstate family staying at their vacation home in Northern Michigan, which took place in the 1960s. This fictional account takes place in the twenty-first century however, and DNA and forensics are part of the story. There is and has been a great deal of conflict between long-time locals and wealthy in-comers from downstate in this beautiful and formerly wide-open country. Several times in the book various characters from downstate make remarks to the effect that they are not in Northern Michigan to have a social life with the locals. They have used their money to buy land with million-dollar views but have no interest in becoming part of the community and hold the local population in contempt. Was this wealthy family, headed by a blunt, self-consciously superior outsider, murdered in reprisal for some percieved insult to a local resident? Or is a random maniac on the loose? Sheriff Hugh DeWitt investigates the case on two fronts, in Northern Michigan and in Ann Arbor, a wealthy university town in Southern Michigan, where the murdered family lived a life of influence and privilege. Sheriff DeWitt's counterpart in Ann Arbor is investigating a serial killing (also a true event, the subject of a book entitled "The Michigan Murders"), but offers his own perspective on DeWitt's case. Judith Guest successfully weaves together elements of both cases with the sociological tensions between the privileged and everyone else to create a book that really is more than just a simple murder mystery.

Sometimes I find a true crime book interesting not because it is well-written or the case unique, but rather because it makes me think deeply about human nature. The other reviews and discussions show that I am not the only one who found this book thought-provoking. I think this story is a cautionary tale that we can all learn from. Dr. Nyce did not simply attract a young, beautiful wife because of his money and social status. He deliberately preyed upon the fact she was from a less wealthy country, using the prospect of moving to the U.S. as enticement, and he wrote to her under false pretenses, lying about his age and sending a very old photo of himself. He was not a heroic doctor, he was a lecherous con-man. Once he came to the Phillipines and she saw that he was old, unattractive, and a boring nerd, she no doubt felt it was too late to back out. We could look at her marrying him as opportunism, but she was making the best of things and doing what was expected of her by her family and the culture she came from. When she became enculturated to the United States, and as she matured and became more powerful, the manipulative doctor was more and more exposed for the pathological liar and loser he really was. One thing I have learned about habitual liars is that they are enraged when their lies are exposed. I think the murder was more about this exposure than the wife's affair, and the investigation and trial dramatised the pattern of lies, covering up, eventual exposure, and damage control that typifies such a personality. I found the portion of the book devoted to the trial to be too in-depth and boring, the sentence unjust, and the histrionic defense attorney as alarming as her client.

I think aggression and manipulation is an "open secret" in our society, and an individual can lead a much more successful life if they have the mental tools to intelligently evaluate and take action against such behavior. "In Sheep's Clothing" could help a reader who is being manipulated and used take necessary steps to deal with a potentially ambiguous situation. If you are beginning to feel that there is something wrong in your relationship (with a relative, significant other, or boss) and that it is not YOU who is crazy, this book might be a good place to start. This would also be a helpful book for a young person entering the workplace or the world of dating to read. I think many of us go out into the world not realizing that we will encounter many people who are sizing us up as potential victims. Those of us who have not already learned to look for covert aggression in people we would hope to find trustworthy (lovers, teachers, therapists, supervisors) might be put on the alert by this book, since these users rely on the victim's and witnesses' denial of what the aggressor are actually doing. The section I found most interesting is the one entitled "Recognizing the Tactics of Manipulation and Control". I think this section is really the heart of the book because the reader can identify the concrete behaviors being used against him and see them for what they are: weapons and tactics of an aggressor. On the downside, I think this book could benefit from a more extensive section on personality disorders. A person who is in a close relationship with a borderline or narcissistic personality disordered abuser would be likely to read this book in the early stages of feeling like something is wrong in their relationship, since manipulation is a major part of the pathology. For someone in this situation, it would be really helpful to be told the characteristics of these disorders so they can more effectively "know their enemy".

All of the products in this kit are ones that I use regularly, and the price is really great! I started using Philosophy skin care a couple of years ago with a kit like this, and my skin improved so much it was just unbelievable. I briefly thought my skin was good on its own, and tried going back to my old department store beauty products, and found myself breaking out again. This kit contains the items I find absolutely essential: Purity cleanser has a very subtle lemon verbena scent and removes all makeup very easily. Hope in a Jar moisturizer has a very cool souffle texture and really hydrates the skin. Some people say they don't like the smell, but I really do. Just these two products used regularly leave my skin very soft and free of blemishes. I have also been using the serum religiously, and based on my non-wrinkly status, it has to be working, plus I'm really impressed with the ingredients. Hope in a tube has a funny stiff texture and great ingredients that have taken away the crepe skin texture I was starting to notice around my eyes. I have never seen such a great deal on these products IN FULL SIZE, so I'm ordering this for sure.

I really like the "Teach Yourself Visually" computer books. I have a collection which includes a selection of all the popular "For Dummies" and similar computer guides, and the "Teach Yourself Visually" is by far the easiest for me to understand. The digital photography programs are very hard for me to learn, and this book helped a lot.

I really enjoyed this book! Many reviewers didn't like Tansy, but the whole point of the story revolves around how her personality evolves after the death of her troubled, alcoholic mother. When the book begins, she is very messed up and hiding a lot of things, just trying to survive with her secrets. She has learned to hide her true self, which never had a chance to mature, behind the facade of a shallow party girl. After her mother's funeral, Tansy od's and wakes up in the hospital. She sets out on what was intended to be a vacation with her boyfriend, who is a bigger loser than Tansy. When he stands her up and she decides to go on the backpack tour by herself, a whole new world opens up for Tansy. This is a fun book, and it has exciting travel and mystery elements, but it is also about how we can be held back by the circumstances of our existance. When Tansy gradually sheds the shell of her damaged past she recreates herself as a much more mature and worthwhile person.

My only complaint about this book is that it only covers two years of the author's life in detail. I hated for the book to end. I wish she had had time to write more, because she was an amazing person. Kitty's father, a doctor, raised his family in a colonial farmhouse by the ocean. Beginning in her childhood, he made Kitty learn to do a man's work in the orchard. He also gave her a series of boats to sail on the ocean. She loved the farm and the sea. She got a college education and a good job in a college museum, but gave it all up when her father died at the beginning of the depression. None of her brothers were willing to do the backbreaking labor to keep the heavily mortgaged farm working. Kitty quit her good job and immersed herself in running the orchard, which her father had always said would save the farm he loved. She lived alone except her beloved dog, with no money and little heat in the winter. Her own family seemed determined to see her fail. She found good, loyal friends though, and though her life was daunting, it was also full of the joy of nature and achievment. I can't praise this book enough.

If you read this book once, you will read it over and over through the years. It makes a great present for young people who love the outdoors, and hunters and outdoorsmen of any age. Ryan McNabb's review says it all, this is a book about growing up to be a real outdoorsman. It is just plain beautiful outdoor writing. I have never read any better. If you liked this book there is also a great sequel called "The Old Man's Boy Grows Older" and some collections of hunting stories that are also very good. Ruark's other novels are not to my liking. Another book for readers of "The Old Man and the Boy" is Jesse Stuart's "Hie to the Hunters".

I saw Jane Alexander, the woman this book is about, on television and had to get this book right away because I was so impressed with her as a person. Jane went from being a very dependent woman, who had mostly been a stay-at-home mom to become a heroic and widely-known crusader for crime victims' rights at an age when most women would be settling into retirement. She had intended to settle into active (and financially comfortable) old age with her boyfriend, who had been a friend of the family and member of her social set for decades. The murder of her wealthy aunt changed all her plans. The boyfriend, a charmer whose tales of international intrigue had once entertained their friends, disappeared after embezzling money from those same friends and draining Jane's assets dry. She lost her beautiful home and even her beloved dog. Some of her old friends stood by her, while others blamed her for harboring a criminal in their community. Jane soon learned that the police and prosecutors were not her friends either. The story of how she battled the system as well as her ex-boyfriend is just amazing. In the course of being her own investigator, she found many, many other women who were drained financially and discarded by this man. She got several of them to testify at his trial. The book is very well written, not necessarily a given in the true-crime genre.

I loved this book! The descriptions of the Yorkshire moors, the town of Haworth, and the parish house and horrible boarding school are amazingly poetic and evocative. I was looking through the book to find a certain passage that just blew my mind, and then found it reprinted on the back of the dustjacket: "With her extraordinary cramped look, with her tiny, tight shoes, her tight little gloves, and with her habit of lurking in corners of the great drawing-room rather than entering into conversations, Charlotte was that type of retiring Sunday school teacher in whom seethe all kinds of perverse, romantic passions. Only, in Charlotte Bronte's case, she being a genius, this was taken to extremes..." How strangely sexy the claustrophobic, restricted lives of this family can seem! This is what I enjoy so much about novelizations as opposed to straight biography. The novelist feels free to use foreshadowing and symbolism and mood in a way that the biographer is afraid of. While the most literal-minded reader finds fault, those of us who are compelled to try on the lives of these fascinating people will find this book irresistable.

I bake a lot, and I read cookbooks all the time, looking for good recipes. I went to the library to copy down a few Christmas cookie recipes, but the recipes and photos in this book looked so great I realized I had to buy it. I have NEVER before found a cookbook where I want to try every recipe in the book, but every recipe in this book scans great (usually my thought pattern is: that sounds good... wait, how much vegetable oil does this recipe call for? eewwww...) If you are looking for Christmas cookie recipes, this is the book I'd get.

The subtitle of this book really sums it up: The Extraordinary Life and Adventures of Miles and Beryl Smeeton. Beryl was born in 1905. Miles was born in 1906. Their early lives were straight out of Rudyard Kipling. They both followed family tradition and were part of the British overseas military life. Beryl was not a shrinking violet. Her brother is quoted in the book as saying "she always regretted that she hadn't been born a man, and that was really what she was trying to make up for all her life. In everything she did- sports, riding, steeple-chasing- her motto was 'Anything you can do, I can do better.' She had this tremendous urge to surpass... She was quite fearless and would never rest or relax." Early in life she married a British officer and travelled with him to India. Beryl had many daring adventures in spite of the expectations of the time. She met and started an affair with Miles, a very tall and handsome younger officer, and her first husband let her go to pursue the life of adventure which she was destined for. Together, Beryl and Miles saw the end of the old British colonial system. The book contains fascinating stories of the "Lancers", which evolved to a tank corps. Miles learned to drive a tank and fly an airplane before he learned to drive an automobile. Beryl travelled extensively, often hiking up mountains in exotic locales, even after she gave birth to her daughter. The baby was lugged around by lackeys and natives, and often left behind to survive as best she could. Part of the more amusing stories in the book are about how cavalier a mother and how horribly bad a cook Beryl was. After Miles left the military, the two set out to explore the world on a sailing vessle, a whole new chapter to their life of adventure. Even in old age, the two continued to live remarkable lives. This book is really just riveting. It is one of the most exciting adventures I have ever read.

"Man and Microbes" is a good title for this book. Over time, man's relationship with microbes has changed as human populations have grown, moved, changed from hunter-gatherer to agricultural life and then city life, and exploration and colonization exposed groups of humans to new environments. As new land is cleared for farming, humans stir up microbes that had previously interacted with other species, such as mice or monkeys. Having never been exposed to a given microbe before, man has not developed any tolerance and the severity of the disease is harsh. Every new human population a disease encounters has to go though this introduction, before the effects become less severe. This is why native American populations were devastated when Europeans came to their continents. The microbes themselves also change over time, becoming more powerful, less powerful, or retreating to their original animal hosts. Since this book attempts to span the history of mankind and our interaction with microbes, there is less detail about specific diseases or time periods than a reader might like. I know I was still left wondering about the specifics of polio after reading the book. But I do feel that I have gained much more insight into disease and how it has affected our history. When we developed vaccines and antibiotics we thought that we had defeated the diseases which had killed so many humans, but the microbes continued to change, just as always, adapting to our new defenses. Human populations continued to grow, expanding to previously unpopulated territory, exposing people already vulnerable though poor diet and hygene to unfamiliar microbes. My view of our war against disease has definitely changed through reading this book.

I really love my Bowflex. After years of working out at the gym, I found myself avoiding it because of the hassle of getting there. I had no idea a piece of equipment you could have in your home would be every bit as heavy-duty and good quality as gym equipment, but the Bowflex is. Although the initial workout started with a lot of assembly, it wasn't hard to figure out, and I began using the Bowflex immediately. I add new exercises all the time for variety, which can keep a potential slacker motivated. The instructional dvd is very useful and easy to understand. The action is amazingly smooth, way smoother than I thought possible. I thought it would be a hassle to change the pulleys for different exercises, but it is very easy and does not interfere with the workout. It does take up some floor space, and you can't fold it up and put it under the bed, but none of the portable or inexpensive equipment I have bough has ever been anywhere near as good as the bowflex.

"The Final Victim" is the first book I have read by Wendy Corsi Staub. I have been reading Donna Anders' thrillers, and was looking for more reading along the same lines: an exciting thriller written from a female point of view, but not a crossover romance, as I have found many books in this genre to be. "The Final Victim" is a satisfyingly thick, exciting, and suspenseful gothic tale, set in an old family mansion on an island near Savannah. The point of view shifted from character to character a lot, which sometimes detracted from the reading experience. There was some painful detail used in itemizing the exact articles of clothing the heroine's husband is wearing when he first appears, as one often sees in a romance novel, but there was also some really nice characterization: the physical description of the family housekeeper was excellent and gave a lot of insight into her personality, and the old family chauffeur was also portrayed with a light and skillful hand. The personality and physical characteristics of a family cousin who has had cosmetic surgery and has been trying to fake it in Hollywood is also summed up in a really witty, restrained way. The story is quite exciting and atmospheric, kept me at the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed "The Final Victim" and will be ordering more books by the same author.

The ingredients in the major brands of store-bought hot cocoa mix are alarming. They don't taste good either. I don't like to think that I actually used to drink the stuff. The Ghirardelli hot cocoa mix is not at all like that nasty sweet stuff. It is just so good! It doesn't have any disgusting ingredients. Of course it is not a low-calorie food, but it's quite good made with whatever level of reduced-fat milk you are accustomed to, and if you mix part cocoa and part coffee, that saves on calories, too. Because it is made with high-quality Ghirardelli cocoa, it tastes even better than mom used to make (my mom didn't have access to gourmet cocoa powder). If you buy this product, you will not be disappointed. It would be nice if this mix was also available in single-serving envelopes.

I don't find most movies that are supposed to frighten me to be all that scary. But this one was. Three girls studying art in Italy decide to go on a little side-trip, which turns into a bloody nightmare. I liked the way the tension built up in a very believable way. The girls start out in beautiful, sunny Italy, and decide to go on a little adventure. They could have gone the luxury route, since one of the girls is rich as Donald Trump. But they want to do the student thing, and take the train, where things start to get scary when they keep encountering a group of threatening young men. Then they are persuaded to change plans and attend a festival in a creepy, Eastern European town and stay in an even creepier youth hostel. Bad, bad things happen, involving chainsaws, cannibalism, and all of the expected things (special effects are very bloody and very realistic looking). Unexpectedly, there is building tension, a discernable plot, and interesting characterization. Richard Burgi is handsome and lends depth to the alpha-male character he plays, with an interesting subplot involving the dynamic between he and his beta-male cohort. I found this definitely worth watching. I will most likely get this out again to watch over next Halloween!

I have read all of Thomas Perry's books. He is a great author! He manages to combine huge amounts of action and suspense with literate writing and well-developed, sensitive and interesting characters. "Dance for the Dead" is about Jane Whitfield, my favorite Thomas Perry character. Jane is a Seneca Indian who grew up near Niagara Falls, and the book is loaded with Indian history. Jane saves people by giving them a new identity and helping them to hide from whatever trouble they are in. This puts her in a lot of danger and provides plenty of opportunity to meet interesting people. Since her life is so dangerous, she keeps a very low profile and doesn't have much of a social life. In this book, she begins a romance with a doctor from her hometown who she has known for a long time, but thankfully this series really sticks to the action and adventure, and never veers too far into romance territory. As other reviewers have noted, it makes me really happy to find a male author who chose to write about such a take-charge, capable woman. I would recommend this whole series to anyone who likes well-written action adventure.

Sheri Heller, a beautiful young New Yorker, met a tall, handsome, elegant Belgian on a plane. Soon Baron Jacques de Borchgrave had seduced her and treated her to exotic trips and expensive clothing. She was swept off her feet, but after they married (as is so often the case), her new husband's mask of gentility came off. This is a story of runaway narcissism and sexual deviance. There is a lot detail about some rather untypical sex, so it's not reading for the easily shocked. Sheri de Borchgrave is an intelligent observer of her own life, and the book is fascinating and well-written. I have never read anything like it.

The characters in this book are so two-dimensional that I could not care about them. I was not even interested in the killer. I knew the main character was going to escape being murdered with only a second or two to spare, I knew the killer was going to try to strangle her with a scarf, but I really didn't care. Reincarnation and hypnotic regression were part of the story, but there was so little depth or detail, it was just not interesting. There are so many thrillers available, and while many of them aren't great, usually they are at least interesting, that it seems like a waste of time to read this one.

This is a very good guide to some of the most scenic hikes in Michigan. If you want to find some good advice about finding beatiful places to hike, but don't need a huge atlas that lists every trail, this book is for you. It is a managable size and has good directions, and the trails are really well-selected. You won't be disappointed by any of them. The book is quite inexpensive. If you want a huge book that gives you every trail in Michigan, choose "Michigan Trail Atlas" by Hansen instead, but it is very big and kind of costly.
