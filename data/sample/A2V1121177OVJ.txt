This is a wondrous short novel. Read it if you'd like to be a teenager again. Buy an old paperback copy showing a teenage boy and girl standing facing each other with their foreheads touching--a very sweet illustration.Now a good review (recommendation) doesn't have to be long, so let me give you a few lines of description. A boy moves from Alabama to New Mexico during World War II, and while his father is away in the war, the boy finds friends and a home in the small mountain town of Sagrado. One of his new friends is an sculptor who carves stone heads and places them on a hillside.On the great book cover: Sometimes book covers actually decline in quality with the many printings of a book. This has happened with "Red Sky At Morning," but remember you are buying the book for the story.Another example of the decline in a book's cover is seen in the early cover for "Summer of Night," by Dan Simmons.Summer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)The 1991 "Warner Book" edition has a window with a cut out. Through the window you can see some boys riding their bicycles at night. When you open the book, you see a mysterious school in the background.The later covers of "Summer of Night" were not half as mysterious or fun.

Note: Some immature Mormon has been slamming my reviews almost as soon as they are posted because of my negative reviews of books defending the Book of Mormon (see Hugh Nibley's books, others).So, your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie or book.I love "Frequency," a story about communication across time using a ham radio (the 1950s to the 1980s). A father and son talk to each other, and alternate futures await them.Enough said, this film is a grabber and a great example of how to build characters have a compelling plot, and all without excessive violence. It's a great murder mystery--I don't want to give anymore away--make it so long you won't want to see the movie.The other thing that makes the movie great is that the action is subordinate to the plot. Too many movies today are all action and little or no plot. I long for the day when special effects and action are kept in balance and don't override the plot.If you like time-travel stories, read the "Far Arena," where a Roman gladiator is cut out of the ice in the North Sea and revived. Kind of a reverse time-travel theme, but one of the best novels I ever read. Highly recommended by a big-time reader.Far Arena, by Ben SapirFar ArenaAlso, for a good time-travel and romance movie, see "Kate and Leopold" with Meg Ryan.Kate & Leopold

I love Bradbury's style, how his writing calls up so many images from my own childhood.When "Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show" rolls into town, two thirteen-year-old boys become involved in a grand mystery. "And that was the October week when they grew up overnight, and were never so young any more..."I loved the merry-go-round that could speed up or reverse aging!I don't like to tell too much about a story, so I'll end with a high recommendation from a life-long-reader.

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews. My review of "Inherit the Wind" is concise and to the point. Oh, I get it. That person is a fanatic, and he or she doesn't like that state of mind exposed.This explosive drama is a re-enactment of one of the twentieth century's greatest courtroom dramas--the 1925 Scopes Trail. The collision of William Jennings Bryan (a religious fundamentalist) and Clarence Darrow (an agnostic) is wonderfully enacted. Scopes, a high-school teacher, was put on trail for teaching evolution.The preacher's daughter is in love with Scopes, and the sparks fly over the conflict. The preacher's religious fanaticism threatens to destroy his own family. Thus, the line from Proverbs 11:29: "He that troubleth his own house Shall inherit the wind."I would also highly recommend Eric Hoffer's classic little book, "The True Believer." A must for educated readers.The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)

Sometimes the time is right to get lost in a novel, and this novel was the one for me. I know this is a short review, but I hope it is "helpful."I do a lot of reading, and about once a year, I come across a novel that grabs me and doesn't let go. "Death Match" was that kind of novel for me.A high-tech computer dating firm offers perfect matches for $25,000, and then something happens to one of their "super couples." They commit a double suicide. Lash, a psychologist with an FBI background, is hired by the founder and CEO of Eden to investigate. The plot kept me turning the pages, and I identified with Lash.I don't want to give the plot away, but I loved the concept of finding your perfect match. Read a longer review after you read the book.I also thought the writing was excellent. I'll be looking for more Lincoln Child novels.

I thoroughly enjoyed "The Eye of the Tiger," even if I agreed with some of the statements in the one-star reviews. It's a man's book, and the author is a bit of a male chauvinist.A forties something man living off the east coast of Africa makes his living taking wealthy tourists out on fishing trips. Then he meets a young man who has some clues to the whereabouts of a sunken sailing ship. Well, I won't ruin the story, but everything gets complicated after that and the bodies start to pile up. Harry, the hero with special ops experience, meets and falls in love with a younger woman who is also involved in the treasure hunt. Sound like a man's story yet?Wilbur Smith uses "lugubriously" in excess--that is to say more than zero. What a word. Yes, I figured it out without going to the dictionary, but it sure was a word that took me out of the story and slowed me down. Here is one of several uses: "That's right," he agreed lugubriously, and pushed his filthy deep-sea cap to the back of his head.I liked "Cry Wolf" much better, but I still recommend this tale to any man interested in an African escape.----------------------------------------------------------------I'm quoting the one-star review by "Dr. Kingston" for the purpose of getting a response to his borrowing charges. I don't know Hemingway's work well enough to judge that angle, so here is the one-star review:Recipe:Take Hemingway's "Islands in the stream"Pepper liberally with voyeuristic daydreams about what it might be like to be character in your own bookFry in the African Coast rather than Cubareflect in ill-deserved gloryTake credit for someone elses workNot the best Wilbur Smith book I've read, but not surprising as its been cribbed from one of Hemingway's that could only be described as "not one of his best" only managing a posthumous release

This has got to be the funniest novel that I've ever read--funny but with a sad side. Get this, the author wrote this story and then died. His mother later took it to the University of Louisianna and had a professor read it. That year it won the Pulitzer Prize. It's that good!

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.This book is one that should be on every educated person's bookshelf. For a book written by a Christian in the fourth century, I was surprised at some of the details. For example, Augustine accepts autopsies as a matter of medical necessity. More well-known is his opposition to astrology.Augustine also had surprisingly enlightened views about dress and appearance. Any race or ethnicity can enter the City of God (an argument made in "The City of God").Augustine says that as a teenager, he and his friends stole some pears and threw them away. Have things really changed? Teenagers up to mischief!In the "City of God," Augustine also marveled at the human mind."In general, the completeness of scientific knowledge is beyond all words and becomes all the more astonishing when one pursues any single aspect of this immense corpus of information. Last, but not least, is the brilliance of talent displayed by both pagan philosophers and Christian heretics in the defense of error and falsehood. In saying this, of course, I am thinking only of the nature of the human mind as a glory of this mortal life, not of faith and the way of truth that leads to eternal life."Here are some more great lines. A philosopher was abroad a ship captained by a bad man, and after a violent storm, the fearless captain jeered the philosopher for his terror. Said the philosopher, quoting from a similar incident that occurred to the pagan Aristippus, `A rogue need not worry about losing his worthless life, but Aristippus has a duty to care for a life like his."Finally, St. Augustine spoke to the modern world and to the "Creationists.""It very often happens there is some question as to the earth or sky, or other elements of this world...respecting which, one who is not a Christian has knowledge...and it is very disgraceful and mischievous and of all things to be carefully avoided, that a Christian speaking of such matters as being according to the Christian Scriptures, should be heard by an unbeliever talking such nonsense that the unbeliever perceiving him to be as wide from the mark as east from west, can hardly restrain himself from laughing."

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.I must have really burned him or her because I've deleted this review and RE-POSTED IT FOUR times and within an forty minutes, I had a "not helpful" vote. Give me a break. That person's faith must be very fragile, indeed. Oh, well, if you can't answer an argument, then throw a temper tantrum.I'm trying to be "helpful," and you can see that I put some work into this review.So, your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and I hope you find some enjoyable quotations (below) from Boswell's wonderful book, but first a little history.Samuel Johnson, the irascible but generous lexicographer of the eighteenth century, is mostly remembered because of Boswell, and Boswell is remembered because he wrote Johnson's biography.At the time, Johnson was already famous for his "Dictionary of the English Language," an impressive work for the year 1755. Among many other writings, Johnson put out an edition of Shakespeare's works (1765), with valuable notes that are still referred to today.The following quotations are from Boswell's book:Johnson published a "series of grave and moral discourses" in the periodical called the Rambler, but when it was translated into Italian, it came out as the ludicrous "El Vagabondo," something far from Johnson's pious intentions. And of good intentions, it was Johnson who said, "Sir, Hell is paved with good intentions.""(Johnson's) defense of tea against Mr. Jonas Hanway's violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, shows how very well a man of genius can write upon the slightest subject, when he writes, as the Italians say, con amore."Johnson despised Americans and was prejudiced against Scotland. He said, "Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel."Johnson was a male chauvinist. Yet, he was "a king of men." He was a "robust genius, born to grapple with whole libraries," and although "indolence and procrastination were inherent in his constitution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one else."As a person who is afraid of death in the normal sense, I was surprised that in spite of being very religious, Johnson had an extreme fear of death. "'The better a man is, the more afraid he is of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity.' Said Boswell, "Johnson owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation, was mysterious; and said, 'Ah! We must wait till we are in another state of being, to have many things explained to us.' Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity."Boswell's commentary brings to mind a story told by St. Augustine in his monumental City of God. A philosopher was abroad a ship captained by a bad man, and after a violent storm, the fearless captain jeered the philosopher for his terror. Said the philosopher, quoting from a similar incident that occurred to the pagan Aristippus, 'A rogue need not worry about losing his worthless life, but Aristippus has a duty to care for a life like his.""Johnson knew more books than any man alive. He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end." But he also held that it was important to "read diligently the great book of mankind.""Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in some degree, the color of the world as it moves along."Johnson was also the one who said, "When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.""I love Blair's Sermons," Johnson said. "Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and every thing that he should not be, I was the first to praise them. Such was my candor," he said with a smile."

I actually agree with most of the reviewers (four stars). Bushman's book is well-written and the most honest biography about Joseph Smith ever written by a Mormon. It is refreshingly honest about the Smith family and their early years.I would also like to note that as a non-Mormon, I do NOT believe that the LDS Church is a cult, and I don't believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the Mormons that I have known have been the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.If you are a Mormon, I also want to say that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. Thank you for taking your time to read it.I noted that "Rough Stone Rolling" is the most honest biography about Joseph Smith ever written by a Mormon. That does not mean, however, that the book is without major flaws. I found several of Bushman's statements impossible to believe. Here they are:1. On page 98, Bushman writes that the Book of Mormon "makes Indians the founders of civilization in the New World." I've read the Book of Mormon several times, and I've had a lifelong acquaintance and friendships with Mormons. I have never--as in NEVER--heard this theory. Jews from the Old World came to America and established civilizations. The wild Lamanites (the Indians--called "Lamanites" all my life) destroyed the white Nephite civilization. Period.Further, every book I ever read on the theme of "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon" was an attempt to show that people other than the Indians are responsible for New World civilization.I am completely stumped as to why Bushman would say that the Book of Mormon makes the Indians the founders of New World civilization. Perhaps, he wants to make the Book of Mormon compatible with modern science (good luck on that).Bushman's statement is so out-to-lunch that if I were to write this review again, I would give it only one star. (You have to delete a review and repost to change the star rating, which deletes all the comments.)In short, the Book of Mormon stands in stark contrast to the findings of New World archaeology. Consider Robert J. Sharer's heavy 753-page "The Ancient Maya." Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, at the University of Pennsylvania.Sharer writes: "After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6).2. On page 95, Bushman says, "The question of origins was not a pressing issue for New York's rural population in 1830." This is clearly a misdirection that moves Bushman's readers away from the popular belief that the Indians were descended from the Jews.The Hebrew origins of the American Indians found front-age coverage in 1825 in the speech of Mordecai Noah when he founded "A World Refuge for the Jews" at "Ararat" on an island in the Niagara River at Buffalo. ("Noah's Ark" with Indians aboard sailed the Erie Canal.) I own many books about the Hebrew origins of the American Indians published in Joseph Smith's youth.Noah's arguments for the "Hebrew Origin" of the Indians came straight from Adair's History of the American Indians (1775). The ceremony at "Ararat" and speech of Major Noah were carried in all the newspapers of upstate New York, including Palmyra's "Wayne Sentinel" of November 15, 1825.Bushman adds that no Indian mounds were "known in Palmyra or Manchester." On Dec. 11, 1811, De Witt Clinton, Governor of New York, said in a "Discourse Delivered Before the New-York Historical Society" that near Canadaigua "there are three" (mounds). "In a word, they are scattered all over that country" (p. 54).3. Bushman uncritically accepts the false notion that there are facts or ideas in the Book of Mormon that were unknown in Joseph Smith's day--specifically "chiasmus," or parallelism in Hebrew poetry (p. 93). Rather than being unknown, these parallelisms in biblical poetry were common knowledge. Thomas Hartwell Horne's book "An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures" was advertised for sale in Palmyra on the front page of the Wayne Sentinel (April, 6, 13, 20 in 1825).The long ad outlines the entire content of Horne's four-volume work, including "the Poetry of the Hebrews and Harmony of the Scriptures." Horne's book is full of diagrams and commentary on Hebrew poetry showing these parallelisms. The diagrams, in fact, serve as examples on how to write parallelisms.These diagrams and commentary are also found in all editions Robert Lowth's "Isaiah" that have a "Preliminary Dissertation"(Check WorldCat). They are also found, of course, in Lowth's "Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews." Michael Quinn in "Early Mormonism and the Magic World View" denounced efforts by FARMS at BYU to hide the existence of such books (p. 504). Considering Bushman's exhaustive research, it must be said that Bushman is familiar with these books (I own original copies published in Joseph Smith's youth).4. Bushman (p. 92) repeats the Mormon myth that there is no archaeological evidence the Huns had horses, so Nephite horses in America could also disappear. False: At excavations (1st and 2nd century BC) of sites of the Hsiung-nu in Russia, bronze plaques have scenes in the "Ordos style" showing horses (see internet examples).Cortes left his lame horse among the Itza Maya, and they fed it meat, on which diet the poor animal died. The Inca carved a Spanish horse on a gold armband and gave it cloven feet like a llama. When the Plains Indians first saw a horse, they called it a "big dog."In short, the New World civilizations did not have horses. Except for pre-historic horses, horse bones, riding artifacts, and art depictions of horses have never been found in the Americas, but they have been found all over the Old World. The Indians didn't kill off Nephite or Spanish horses. Domestication was a key to survival of all barnyard animals. What about Book of Mormon sheep, cattle, oxen, etc? No evidence.In all his examples, Bushman uncritically accepts the much criticized "scholarship" of Hugh Nibley at BYU. See my reviews of Nibley's books.Lehi in the Desert & the World of the JareditesSince Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern worldAn Approach to the Book of Mormon (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 6)Here is a reply I received from a good Mormon about my review of one of Nibley's books."As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."I would also criticize Bushman for uncritical acceptance of the work of John L. Sorenson. See my review of "Echoes and Evidences."Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon5. Finally, Bushman advances the bizarre theory that Joseph Smith's involvement in magic was a "prepratory gospel," I believe was the term he used. This idea is just plain weird.In short, while Bushman's book is well written, it repeats the many falsehoods advanced by FARMS at BYU.Your comments--positive or negative-are appreciated. Thanks.

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open-mindedness in reading this review. I also want you to know that I like Mormons, and even love a few Mormons, whom I consider some of the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Also, check my one-star reviews of books by Mormon "scholars," such as Hugh Nibley (World of the Jaredites), John Sorensen (in "Echoes and Evidences for the Book of Mormon"), and Milton R. Hunter's books.I also reviewed Grant Palmer's book, "An Insiders View of Mormon Origins."An Insider's View of Mormon OriginsSo now for the facts:Joseph Smith demonstrated his ability to write Book of Mormon scripture by composing the scripture-sounding "Preface" (now dropped) as well as the two testimonies (originally at the end of the book). Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. "I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean...."2. "And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though...." (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. "...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ...." (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. "And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean...."5. "...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name...." (Written in the sixth century BC)6. "...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over...."7. "...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."NOTE: Number "6" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number "7" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of "and it came to pass").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of "Mound Builders" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably "View of the Hebrews," published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or "farm boy" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to "write" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he "translated" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read "American Apocrypha," a collection of essays by former Mormons.American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....""Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence."Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text."To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.""The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties."Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: "After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, "are to be `explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.""The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters." "But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World."Every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth." This book provides the context for the novel called the "Book of Mormon."Also, read Robert Wauchope's 150-page book, "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians."Check out the following links to two very rewarding books:Mound BuildersLost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of AmeriYour comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

Note the following:PART OF THE PREFACE TO THE BOOK OF MORMON COMPOSED BY JOSEPH SMITHAs many false reports have been circulated respecting the following work, and also many unlawful measures taken by evil designing persons to destroy me, and also the work....notwithstanding my utmost exertions to recover it again....Satan had put I into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering the words, that they did read contrary from that which I translated and caused to be written; and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of this generation, that they might not receive this work....Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commandedSLIGHT CHANGES TO SHOW THAT JOSEPH SMITH COULD COMPOSE BOOK OF MORMON SCRIPTURE:As many false reports had been circulated in the land, many unlawful measures were taken against Nephi by the evil designing Lamanite king. But notwithstanding Nephi's utmost exertions, Satan had put it into their hearts to tempt the Lord their God, by altering Nephi's words, that they did read contrary from that which he caused to be written as testimony on gold plates. And it came to pass, that Nephi said, If I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should write the same over again, they would publish that which they had stolen, and Satan would stir up the hearts of Lamanites, that they might not receive this work. Wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, I, Nephi have, through his grace and mercy, accomplished that which he hath commanded.The preface also shows the back-tracking style found throughout the Book of Mormon.Note the following examples:l. "I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean...."2. "And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though...." (Supposedly written in 148 BC-before Christ)3. "...so long as there should be a band of Christians remain to possess the land--For thus all the true believers of Christ...." (Supposedly written in 73 BC)4. "And behold in the end of this book...Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean...."5. "...it must needs be expedient that Christ-for in the last night an angel spake unto me that this should be his name...." (Written in the sixth century BC)6. "...and if I should bring forth the same words again, or, in other words, if I should translate the same over...."7. "...that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people."NOTE: Number "6" (above) was written by Joseph Smith in his 1830 preface of the Book of Mormon, a preface now deleted, and number "7" was also written by Joseph Smith as he later described his visit with an angel.Also, remember that Joseph Smith didn't know when to quit talking. His prayer for the dedication of the Kirkland Temple, according to the guides, was a couple hours long. Thus, again he demonstrated his ability to spin scripture as fast as his scribe could write it down.Published in 1830, the original Book of Mormon bears all the marks of a novel written by a relatively uneducated man. Some 4000 changes have been made in grammar (also deleting the overuse of "and it came to pass").Also, some significant errors corrected (King Benjamin was dead at one point and it was changed to Mosiah). In addition, it contains errors that are found in the King James Bible at the time.Taking the popular folklore of the lost white race of "Mound Builders" and that the Indians were descended from the Jews, Joseph Smith had all the makings of a novel set in his lap. He was not a scholar, but he used a few books as references--notably "View of the Hebrews," published in Poultney, Vermont, where his chief scribe and third cousin, Oliver Cowdery, came of age.The project took about a year. At the age of twenty-two-and-half, Joseph Smith dictated 116 pages over a two month period. When these pages were lost or stolen, he waited some nine months (with some composition in between) before starting again. Then after three months, he completed his novel at age twenty-three-and-a-half.At the time, Joseph Smith was not a teenager or "farm boy" as many Mormon writers say, deliberately confusing Joseph's teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon. He was a married man of 22-23 when he began his novel.Note, also, that Joseph Smith didn't have to "write" a single word. He had various scribes do that as he "translated" from behind a curtain by looking at a magic stone placed in a hat.For a fascinating look at the problems of the Book of Mormon, read "American Apocrypha," a collection of essays by former Mormons. American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)The following is from an essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....""Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence."Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text."To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.""The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties."Further, there is no archaeological evidence for the claims of the Book of Mormon. Read the following:Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.Sharer writes: "After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, "are to be `explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.""The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters." "But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World."Lastly, every Mormon should read Robert Silverberg's book, "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth." This book provides the context for the novel called the "Book of Mormon.Mound BuildersAnother great book is Robert Wauchope's 150-page "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians."Lost Tribes & Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of Ameri

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews. He or she doesn't want you to read Hoffer's book.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.On The True Believer: This collection of essays is a classic, and it can be read in independent sections. "The Absence of Religion in Shakespeare" was fascinating.The essays are full of the epigrams that make Santayana famous--"Oaths are the fossils of piety.""But for Shakespeare, in the matter of religion, the choice lay between Christianity and nothing. He choose nothing." Yet: "Life did not pass before his eyes as a mere phantasmagoria. He seized upon its principles; he became wise.""In Shakespeare's time and country, to be religious already began to mean to be Puritanical; and in the divorce between the fulness of life on the one hand and the depth and unity of faith on the other,there could be no doubt to which side a man of imaginative instincts would attach himself."Other great essays in this book include, "The Poetry of Barbarism" and "The Poetry of Christian Dogma."From an essay in other book comes Santayana's famous line: "A fanatic is a person who redoubles his effort after he has forgotten his aim." "A fanatic closes his eyes daily to the sun, so that he might see better by starlight."Hear, hear! You cannot call yourself educated without having read Santayana. Also, read Eric Hoffer's little book, "The True Believer." Click here:The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)Another great book is "A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought," by David Allen Williams.

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. You don't want to re-tell the whole story. I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book. In my opinion, you should read long reviews after you read the novel. Read a short review first.This story is not the blood-and-guts scary we're used to with Steven King, but it is scary. A nine-year-old girl becomes lost in the woods of Maine for days and days. What an adventure! And what's following her! I don't want to give anything away, but this story is only lightly supernatural.It's one of King's best stories in my opinion. The book-on-tape version is also fantastic.Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry over my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as I post them.So, your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksA short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie.This is a super romantic movie that even men will like. It's a wonderful romance involving a Korean War veteran who returned home to a changed world. He's married and leaves on a train trip selling chocolates. On the train, he meets a young woman who is going home to her family's vineyard in Napa, California. A warm movie about family and love. Anthony Quinn is great as the grandfather.I always hesitate to say too much about a movie for fear of ruining for the first-time viewer. This is enough, except to say that I've watched it a million times--well at least fifty.

I loved how the story started out slow. We got to know the characters,and there was time to suspend belief (extremely important in ghoststories).But--but I didn't find the story scary. The ghost of Mrs. Caldean wasa festering corpse. That's not scary, just disgusting. The part aboutthe bats giving birth was designed to be scary, but it was alsodisgusting (bats don't scare me).A stylistic no-no. Herbert needed an editor. That's a common problemwith famous writers. They begin to think they don't need an editor.For example, what was Herbert trying to prove with the followingsentence (page 308): "But still I didn't understand!" ("Understand" isunderlined! Herbert did this a couple times, and it waslike reading a note passed between teenagers. "I REALLY HATE you." Underlined.Finally, in pulling the ends of the story together, Herbert did toomuch. Midge's amazon friend arrives in the nick of time. There was noreason to bring her back into the story. She was a sterotypicalcharacter that played a role but didn't need to be returned to theending.Also, it weakens a ghost story to justify the existence of ghosts (orthe paranormal). These things should be introduced in another way. Forexample, I love reincarntation stories, but please don't try to getme to believe in reincarnation by noting the beliefs of the Hindus andother religions. In a couple instances, I felt like Herbert was tryingto show that atheists are wrong (what does that have to do with a ghoststory?). It weakens novels when the author tries to make such philosophicalarguments (leave that for an essay). Yes, there are examples to thecontrary, but I picked up this book to be entertained, not converted tosome new-age religion.Some parts were unintentionally funny. A friend of Mike and Midge wakes up inscreaming terror, and Mike suggests that all the man needs is to go back tosleep in the house! Like, "Don't worry, Bill. After experiencing that heart-stoppinghorror, all you need is to go back to sleep in the same room. Funny, and of course,the guy wastes no time in leaving the cottage.In short, I liked the story but thought that it should have been editedto make it more scary.

I don't normally like sad stories, but this novel had a so many beautiful lines that it deserves the high praise it has received. Here are a few of them--what passion!I hope my efforts at finding these wonderful lines makes your reading of my review worthwhile:"Just one way, you do get back home. You have a boy or a girl of your own and now and then you remember, and you know how they feel, and its almost the same as if you were your own self again, as young as you could remember" (p. 94)."'Look at me, Poll,' he said. She looked at him. `That's when you're going to need every ounce of common sense you've got,' he said. `Just spunk won't be enough; you've got to have gumption. You've got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is especially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice. You've got to keep your mind off pitting your own rotten luck and setting up any kind of howl about it. You've got to remember that things as bad as this and a hell of a lot worse have happened to millions of people before and that they've come thought it and that you will too. You'll bear it because there isn't any choice--except to go to pieces. You've got two children to take care of. And regardless of that you owe it to yourself and you owe it to him. You understand me'" (p. 148-149)."One by one, million by million, in the prescience of dawn, every leaf in that part of the world was moved" (p. 201)."On the rough wet grass of the back yard my father and mother have spread quilts. We all lie there, my mother, my father, my uncle, my aunt, and I too am lying there....They are not talking much, and the talk is quiet, of nothing in particular, of nothing at all in particular, of nothing at all. The stars are wide and alive, they seem each like a smile of great sweetness, and they seem very near. All my people are larger bodies than mine, quiet, with voices gentle and meaningless like the voices of sleeping birds....By some chance, here they are, all on this earth; lying, on quilts, on the grass, in a summer evening, among the sounds of the night. May God bless my people, my uncle, my aunt, my mother, my good father, oh, remember them kindly in their time of trouble; and in the hour of their taking away" (p. 15).Highly recommended.

I have quoted below what Roberts said about "View of the Hebrews," and it is not at all clear that this was not his genuine belief. A couple other reviewers said that Roberts letter about playing "devils advocate" should have been included, and I agree.Nevertheless, these writers completely ignore the social pressure of Roberts many family and friends. If he had not backed off, he would have lost everything. I personally knew an aged professor who told me that he was an atheist. He had been on a mission decades before, and when he died, he had a Mormon funeral at a Mormon ward.I'm not making up this story, and in my own life, I could name at least fifteen people who do not believe a word of the Book of Mormon, but who are still on the roles because of social pressure--fear of hurting parents or other relatives, and fear of loosing friends.The pressure on a public figure like Roberts would have silenced him. If you look at what he wrote below, it is impossible to believe that he was simply playing the "devil's advocate." The picture is much more complicated than that.Robert's said:"It has been pointed out in these pages that there are many things in the former book that might well have suggested many major things in the other. Not a few things merely, one or two, or half dozen, but many; and it is this fact of many things of similarity and the cumulative force of them that makes them so serious a menace to Joseph Smith's story of the Book of Mormon's origin.""The material in Ethan Smith's book is of a character and quantity to make a ground plan for the Book of Mormon: It supplies a large amount of material respecting American antiquities--leading to the belief that civilized or semi-civilized nations in ancient times occupied the American continents" (B. H. Roberts, p. 240, above).

I made some Mormons angry over my reviews of books that defend the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews. Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksOn Kon-Tiki: I absolutely got lost in this magnificent adventure. Nevertheless, Heyerdahl's theory that civilization was spread around the world by some lost white race is simply bogus racism. Still, I enjoyed all his books, including "The Ra Expeditions," and "Aku-Aku."It is sad to think that Heyerdahl's career as a fearless adventurer is marred by his zealous devotion to a dated idea. Yes, Peruvian Indians could have crossed the Pacific, but it is more likely that contact came from the other way. At any rate, Heyerdahl manufactured the archaeological evidence he found on Easter Island.In the July 2002 issue of the "Smithsonian Magazine," Richard Conniff demonstrated that Heyerdahl actually paid the natives to make reed-boats relics (Kon Artist?" was the title). "A good story," said Conniff, "can be so compelling that teller and subject become entrapped together in its charms...." (p. 28). This astute observation could apply to novels claimed to be actual history, and anyone interested in the Book of Mormon should give it long thought.Heyerdahl wrote about Pedro Pate, an Easter Islander and how Pate found a two-masted reed boat in a cave. Conniff wrote: "I showed Pate a two-page photograph of the reed boat from Heyerdahl's book, and he grinned. He'd carved the boat himself, he said. Dubious, I offered him $100 to carve such a boat now, 37 years later, and he accepted." "A few days later, he presented me with the 18-inch-long reed boat he had carved. It was as good as the one in the book" (p. 29).In "The Ancient American Civilizations," Friedrich Katz asked some very hard questions of Heyerdahl's theory."If the Polynesians really do come from America, why do their chronicles record the exact opposite direction, naming South-East Asia as their place of origin? Why is their language first and foremost related to South-Asiatic and Malayan languages? Finally, as Trimborn remarked, 'Were not the Polynesian Vikings, rather than the Indians, not the sailors who crossed the high seas?'" (p. 18).Heyerdahl should also be criticized for playing word games, selecting a word here and there, but ignoring the whole language. Many linguists criticized this erroneous method of relating two ancient peoples. See Robert Wauchope's magnificent little book, "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians." See my review.Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theMormon writers frequently cite Heyerdahl because he proved that ancient voyages across the oceans were possible--an idea going back hundreds of years and not new with Heyerdahl. Very few scholars ever denied that such ancient voyages were possible.But ah, there's the rub, as Hamlet said. If they occurred, what would be the effect on an entrenched native culture? The Book of Mormon has ancient voyages (the Jaredites were supposed have crossed the ocean on a 344-day voyage in eight submarines in about 2,000 BC). It is primarily about the great civilizations the Jaredites and Nephites established in the Americas.Robert Sharer summarizes the modern state of knowledge in his heavy and authoritative book, "The Ancient Maya." Sharer writes:"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, "are to be `explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.""The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters.""But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World." See Sharer's book and my review.The Ancient Maya, 6th EditionNone of these serious criticisms of the claims of Mormons or of Heyerdahl's theories, however, should detract from Heyerdahl's great adventures. His accounts of his raft voyages are breathless and compelling reading.For a masterful telling of Polynesian history (especially about Easter Island) by a scholar with a Moari heritage, read the essential book "Vikings of the Pacific," by Peter H. Buck. Click here to read my review:Vikings of the Pacific

Thanks. It took some effort to type up the following wonderful lines from this story about an invasion from Mars. I hope you enjoy them."No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment."Don't miss the other great novels by H.G. Wells--"The Time Machine" and "The Invisible Man." The wonderful opening lines of "War of the Worlds" are worth repeat readings--note the phrase "across the gulf of space."

I love Steven King, and "Misery" is one of his more memorable shorter novels, and as always King plays to our deepest fears.I don't like telling the whole plot of novels. Long reviews are better to read after you've read the novel, itself. A short review that can capture the "hook" can still be a good review. So here it is:A male writer of a romance series is rescued after a car crash and then held hostage by a psychopathic woman fan who does not want the series to end. The woman is a nurse, and she has all the means to tend to the man--forever. Well, enough said. "Misery" is a great read.On other books: If you haven't read Steven King's "Tommyknockers," then do so. A woman in Maine stumbles on a piece of metal in the woods and starts digging. She keeps coming back and gradually unearths an alien spaceship that crashed 80,000 years ago. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended. I had to find out what was buried in those woods."The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" is another great read. A nine-year-old girl is lost in the Maine woods in this short novel with a lightly supernatural aspect. Highly recommended.

Hoffer's 150-page book is a classic that applies perfectly to our times. Hoffer hits the mark again and again with "Machiavellian detachment" as one reviewer said. Of fanatics, Hoffer wrote:"The effectiveness of a doctrine should not be judged by its profundity, sublimity or the validity of the truths it embodies, but by how thoroughly it insulates the individual from his self and the world as it is.""The effectiveness of a doctrine does not come from its meaning but from its certitude.""It is obvious, therefore, that in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand. A doctrine that is understood is shorn of its strength." (quotations from page 76)Very powerful and convincing reasoning!

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.This review of the "Heart of Darkness" is pretty good if I do say so myself. Note the wonderful lines you get to read out of two novels. It was a bit of trouble to find them. I hope you enjoy them.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.Don't be put off by the word "masterpiece." The "Heart of Darkness" is a great adventure story, but so much more. You will find yourself plumbing its depths as Conrad describes a voyage up the Congo on an old steamer. Conrad's language is magnificent, and to be savored.In modern times, Cormac McCarthy (see Blood Meridian) has recast Conrad's powerful style and made it his own. The following comparison reveals a lot about both writers."The Heart of Darkness," by Joseph Conrad:"We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, , of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who could tell" we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse.

Note: Some immature Mormon is angry over my negative reviews of books written to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. My review is short and to the point. In my opinion, it's better to read the longer reviews after you see the movie or read the book. ThanksMeg Ryan and Tim Robbins play two unlikely star-crossed lovers. Robbins is an auto mechanic and Ryan is the grand-niece of Albert Einstein. This warm romantic comedy is just plain fun. Einstein helps Robbins present a paper on physics, and Ryan gradually realizes that she is in love.And don't mark it off as a "chick flick." You guys out there will love it, too. I've watched it many, many times.I also highly recommend "A Walk in the Clouds," a romance set in Napa, California in the 1950s.A Walk in the Clouds

Much has been written about this classic biography of Joseph Smith, and even after sixty years, the writing is fresh and brilliant. If she were writing today, however, Brodie's book would be twice as long because so much new information has come to light--especially about Joseph Smith's involvement in magic. See D. Michael Quinn's massively documented, yet very readable, "Early Mormonism and the Magic World View."Early Mormonism and the Magic World ViewLike Brodie, Quinn was excommunicated for telling the truth about Joseph Smith.You know that Fawn Brodie has come a long way when even Mormons can praise it. In "Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism," the distinguished Mormon historian Richard Bushman wrote:"As notable for its journalistic brilliance as for its scholarship, `No Man Knows My History' presented Riley's arguments and findings in a form more palatable to twentieth-century tastes" (p. 191).The critics of Brodie have also failed. In "Critiquing the Critics," Haart Wixom (p. 120-121) writes the following about an article Brodie quoted from the "St. Louis Bulletin" about Martha Brotherton who left polygamy. It "appears Brodie made up at least part, if not all, of the Brotherton story. Whether she knowingly gave a wrong reference or not, it is nevertheless bogus."Just previously, Wixom condescendingly refers to Brodie as "the woman," and he denies that the newspaper even existed. It does exist.Actually the name of the newspaper is the "American Bulletin," published in St. Louis--a minor error on Brodie's part, and one that I discovered in two minutes of research on the Internet.The article describes the methods used at Nauvoo by early Mormons, including Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, to get young women to marry them (Smith married a daughter and then her mother--Patty and Silvia Sessions; Young two sisters).In another case, Wixom erroneously writes: "She (Brodie) says Joseph probably got his idea for a higher priesthood from a book written by James Gray, giving no title or footnotes" (p. 177). On the contrary, Gray's book is footnoted on page 111 of Brodie's book. Nevertheless, this is an odd criticism for Wixom to make because he doesn't mention the title of Gray's book. The title is easy to find. Just google "James Gray, Melchesedec."Brodie wrote: "It seems likely that Joseph that Joseph concept of duel priesthood came directly from James Gray's `Dissertation on the Coincidence between the Priesthoods of Jesus Christ and Melchisedec' (Philadelphia, 1810). Her comment is reasonable: it does seem "likely." The title of Gray's book will catch the eye of anyone familiar with Mormonism.My criticism would be that Brodie could have made a stronger case by putting the name of Gray's book in the text rather than in a footnote. She also could have quoted from Gray's 121 page pamphlet-book. In just an hour of reading, an intelligent person would have a complete scriptural justification for the Melchisedec priesthood in a church--not just an idea for the Melchisedec priesthood, but detailed justification.I would say this in criticism of Brodie. She completely dismisses the Spalding theory. While I believe that Brodie is correct in saying that Joseph Smith composed the Book of Mormon himself, the similarities of the plot elements in "Manuscript Found" are troubling. They insure that Solomon Spalding's ghost will never rest.It seems possible that Joseph Smith could have heard about Spalding's story without actually having seen it. Thus, it could have had an influence on Joseph Smith.Nevertheless, here are the plot elements of "Manuscript Found" compared to those of the Book of Mormon (plot elements never listed by Mormon writers for fear of opening a can of worms--Brodie did not list them either).In about 1812, the Reverend Solomon Spalding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. Spalding lived in Connecut, Ohio, less than 200 miles from Palmyra (on the Great Lake's trade route, so traveler could have told Joseph Smith about Spalding's story).Spalding described an ancient American civilization in as much detail as is found in the Book of Mormon (1830). Spalding even read passages of his novel to his congregation (thus insuring that it was spread far and wide).So we have two stories, each purporting to be a history, and each featuring a "translator," who finds an ancient account of a lost white American civilization.In each story, the civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has "epistles"), "Censors" are the rulers ("Judges" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands.The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). In both works, the white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher ("Bosaka" in "Manuscript Found" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In this last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Each account also claims that the ancient Americans possessed the modern knowledge that the earth rotates around the sun, rather than vise verse. Both stories feature an item of technology consistent with the 1800s, rather than thousands of years ago. The Book of Mormon has submarines; the American Robert Fulton built his famous Nautilus in 1800; Spalding's story has a hot-air balloon (note the famous French balloon flights of the 1780s). These hot technologies of the day were story elements of the newly-born American literature. Spalding and Smith were perhaps the first American writers to include them in a novel.There are other coincidences. The world's first reconstructed mammoth skeleton, "the ninth wonder of the world," went on display in Philadelphia in 1802, and coincidentally "elephants" are found in the Book of Mormon (1830) and "mamoons" in "Manuscript Found" (1812).One would think that the plot elements of the two stories would at least be discussed by Mormon writers out to disprove the Spalding Theory. But no, they shift the focus to how did Joseph Smith come to read Spalding's manuscript? Some critics said that the link between the stories was Syndey Rigdon, the first major convert to Mormonism. Rigdon had lived in Pittsburg and was known at the printshop where Spalding sent his manuscript.Although I believe that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon, the "Pittsburgh coincidence" has never set well with me. Like a detective investigating an unsolved murder, the possibility that Smith in some way borrowed from Spalding story will never be laid to rest.Curiously, one Mormon writer in criticising the Spalding Theory said there are "no complex Chiasms appear in MS (Manuscript Found)." See "Refuting the Critics: Evidences of the Book of Mormon's Authenticity," by Michael Griffith, p. 81. Griffith's statement is an admission that "chiamus" (parallelisms in Hebrew poetry) were around in 1812. They have been pointed out by proponents of the Spalding Theory. See my review of "By the Hand of Mormon," by Terryl L. Givens. Click here:By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World ReligionRobert Silverberg in the "Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth" is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. "Neutral observers," he writes, "generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding" (p. 96).Silverberg's book is a must-read for anyone interested in the world of Joseph Smith and the great Mound Builder myth.

Note: Your helpful votes are appreciated. Thanks.In my opinion, a shorter review is better before you read the book. Read the longer review after. I'll just give the idea for this memorable novel.Pierre Boulle, author of "Planet of the Apes," tells an impossible-to-put-down tale of a British officer and his men who are forced to build a bridge by the Japanese. Taking place in World War II, the story posses all kinds of questions--the British officer is proud of his work and hates to see it destroyed.But what should he do? He's in a war, and his job is to destroy enemy bridges and anything else he can find. When the bridge is completed, it's a hard call for him.Not to be missed!

I love Steven King! But--this novel was too dark, and it had a plot problem. I could not accept the idea of parents allowing their teenagers to be in a race in which failure meant death (soldiers shooting the kids that slowed down--shooting them in front of watching crowds!).If you make things too inhuman, you go so far over the top that the reader has a hard time accepting the premise. This novel is heavy with the metaphor that we are all born in a race and get picked off one by one. This view of life just does not appeal to me.MAKING KING'S NOVEL BETTER: Okay, the boys join the long walk, and when someone slows down, they are picked up by a white van and taken away. Everyone believes they are being treated well. But the hero discovers a dark truth. He runs off the side of the road to take a leak, and he sees a white van. He sneaks up and looks in the windows. Inside, a doctor is removing the heart of one of the runners. Thus, the boys are all being killed for their organs--including their families who just up and disappear because of this evil organization. At the end, the boys rebel and attack the white van. They kill the bad guys, and the evil organization is revealed and destroyed.Wouldn't that be more satisfying? As it is...I won't tell the ending, but it is not satisfying. In the "Stand," billions of people die off, and a few good guys re-establish civilization. In the "Tommyknockers," the bad aliens get their just reward.That's what the readers of horror novels want--a scary escape that ends on a hopeful note. We read books about horrible things that turn out good (even if a lot of good people get killed). We don't always need a happy ending, but at least a satisfying ending.King's essay at the beginning of the book on the "Importance of Being Richard Backman" was interesting, but weird. Oh, well, like I said, I love Steven King's novels, but this one didn't work for me--too much of the same thing.Read my review of Steven King's "Colorado Kid," which I think had a similar flaw.The Colorado Kid (Hard Case Crime)

Check out these lines:"The sad engineer would never go back to England; he would become one of these elderly expatriates who hide out in remote countries, with odd sympathies, a weakness for the local religion, an unreasonable anger, and the kind of total recall that drives curious strangers away."Speaking of young foreign travelers, Theroux says:"Occasionally, I saw an amorous pair leave their compartment hand in hand to go copulate in the toilet.Most were on their way to India and Nepal, because`the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of KhatmandhuAnd the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.'But the majority of them, going for the first time, had that look of frozen apprehension that is the mask of the face of an excapee."Theroux has a great quote in the beginning of the first chapter--"The journey is the goal."

I read this book ten years after its publication and without doubt, it is one of the most powerful and vivid novels I have ever read. What a stupendous writer! The critics said, "McCarthy employs a neo-Biblical rhetoric, a soaring, pulsing...always stirring diction without parallel in American writing today." "An extraordinary, breathtaking achievement." What a book!Also great is McCarthy's "All the Pretty Horses" (1992), about two boys who cross the Texas-Mexico boarder on horseback in 1949.In the following passage from Blood Meridian, here come the Indians, driving cattle before them as they charge into battle against the American adventurers in northern Mexico in the late 1840's.There is nothing to distract your eye's mesmerizing march across the page. Powerful and relentless, run-on sentences. McCarthy's intention is to conjure up a vision by putting the reader into a trance."The first of the herd began to swing past them in a pall of yellow dust, rangy slatribbed cattle with horns that grew agoggle and no two alike and small thin mules coalblack that shouldered one another and reared their malletshaped heads above the backs of the others and then more cattle and finally the first of the herders riding up the outer side and keeping the stock between themselves and the mounted company (of Americans). Behind them came a herd of several hundred ponies. The sergeant looked for Candelario. He kept backing along the ranks but he could not find him. He nudged his horse through the column and moved up the far side. The lattermost of the drovers were now coming through the dust and the captain was gesturing and shouting. The ponies had begun to veer off from the hear and the drovers were beating their way toward this armed company met with one the plain. Already you could see through the dust on the ponies' hides the painted chevrons and the hands and rising suns and birds and fish of every device like the shade of old work through sizing on a canvas and now too you could hear above the pounding of the unshod hooves the piping of the quena, flutes made from human bone, and some among the company had begun to saw back on their mounts and some to mill in confusion when up from the offside of those ponies there rose a fabled horde of mounted lancers and archers bearing shields bedight with bits of broken mirrorglass that cast a thousand unpieced suns against the eyes of their enemies. A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of the prior owners, coasts of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in whited stockings and a bloodstained weddingveil and some in headgear of cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo....And on and on until the reader is drained.I am very much reminded of Joseph Conrad here. Its takes a mature reader to fully appreciate the power of Cormac McCarthy's writing. It is clearly adult fiction.Here is another great paragraph from "Blood Meridian" (page 47) that could have come straight from Joseph Conrad's pen:"That night they rode through a region electric and wild where strange shapes of soft blue fire ran over the metal of the hoses' trappings and the wagonwheels rolled in hoops of fire and little shapes of pale blue light came to perch in the ears of the horses and in the beards of the men. All night sheetlightning quaked and sourceless to the west beyond the midnight thunderheads, making a bluish day of the distant desert, the mountains on the sudden skyline stark and black and lived like a land of some other order out there whose true geology was not stone but fear. The thunder moved up from the southwest and lightning lit the desert all about them, blue and barren, great clanging reaches ordered out of the absolute night like some demon kingdom summoned up or changeling land that come the day would leave them neither trace nor smoke nor ruin more than any troubling dream."Compare above lines to similar lines in "The Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad:"We could have fancied oursleves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, , of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who could tell" we were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign--and no memories."

This novel about an encounter with a stupendous alien spaceship inspired in me more daydreams than I can count. Rama is the perfect design for spaceship that can travel between the stars. It's in the shape of a tin can, protected from the harmful radiation of space by thick walls, and rotating to produce artificial gravity. This cylinder world, complete with an ocean, streams, forests, is a mini-Earth. Ah, the dreams!--and so intellectually stimulating.It is explored by astronauts as it approaches the earth.Another irresistable story is the "Far Arena," by Richard Ben Sapir.

The astronauts have landed on Mars, but they see not barren wastes but a green town from 1926 in Illinois. As you read the following, think how wonderful it would be to wander down the streets of this hometown! This chapter originally came from--and appropriately--from Bradbury's short story "Is Mars Heaven?""It was a beautiful spring day. A robin sat on a blossoming apple tree A robin sat on a blossoming apple tree and sang continuously. Showers of petal snow sifted down when the wind touched the green branches, and the blossom scent drifted upon the air. Somewhere in the town someone was playing the piano and the music came and went, came and want, softly, drowsily. The song was 'Beautiful Dreamer.' Somewhere else a phonograph, scratchy and faded, was hissing out a record of 'Roamin' in the Gloamin,' sung by Harry Lauder."Now the phonograph record being played was:'Oh, give me a June nightThe moonlight and you...."...They set foot upon the porch. Hollow echoes sounded from under the boards as they walked to the screen door. Inside they could see a bead curtain hung across the hall entry, and a crystal chandelier and a Maxfield Parrish painting framed on one wall over a comfortable Morris chair. The house smelled old, and of the attic, and infinitely comfortable. You could hear the tinkle of ice in a lemonade pitcher. In a distant kitchen, because of the heat of the day, someone was preparing a cold lunch. Someone was humming under her breath, high and sweet...."Of course, everything is not as it appears.

The idea of showing up at work and nobody recognizing you really hooked me. I had to keep reading to find the answer, and I'm glad that I did. The ending was a surprise too. I don't want to be a spoiler, so just read this novel!I would fault Andrew Klavan, however, for killing off one of the secondary characters late in the story. That was unnecessary, and in a way broke trust with the reader. We don't care how many good guys are killed to further the plot, but that character could have been badly wounded. Also, the ending should have been very clear. As a reader, I hate it when things are not totally and absolutely wrapped up (it was, but I wish he had written another half page).Nevertheless, I highly recommend this forgotten thriller.If you like this strange plot of someone going to work and nobody recognizing them, then also read "The Trader," by Charles DeLint. A old man wakes up in the body of a young man and vise-versa. The problem is that the young punk now has all his money. I won't say anymore.Trader (Newford)You would probably also like Richard Laymon's "Body Rides."Body RidesAnd "Desolate Angel," by Chaz McGee, where a detective is murdered and wakes up as a ghost.Desolate Angel (A Dead Detective Mystery)

A great yarn: I really enjoyed this story, but I think it needed a little editing--say 10 pages altogether of dialog. I don't want to give the plot away (read other reviews), but I think it should have been toned down a bit on the stereotypes (using the "N" word too much, resulting in some distraction for the reader. A little editing out would have made its use more powerful).But I let those things go and kept reading. It would be unfair to take off any stars for those things. A novel is not reality.I'm reminded of "Boy's Life," by Robert McCammon. One of the characters in a small southern town walks around with no clothes on, but nobody does anything because he is the son of the owner of the town's only bank. Now I had no problem with the the son being crazy, but having him walk around in the altogether was a little over the top. And not realistic. Still, "Boy's Life" was one of the best books I ever read.That said, I still enjoyed "A Fine Dark Line," and at the end, it brought tears to my eyes. So what more can I say? I got into the life of thirteen-year-old Stanley Mitchell and wanted to find out how the mystery ended. I will definitely read more novels by Joe Lansdale.Check out the following three great coming-of-age stories:1. "Boy's Life," by Robert McCammonBoy's Life2. "Summer of Night, by Dan SimmonsSummer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)3. "The Traveling Vampire Show," by Richard LaymonThe Traveling Vampire Show

A short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great novel. I've just noted the general theme. ThanksA group of adventures with an old map travel to Iceland and find a cave. They enter the cave and follow a path to the center of the earth, where they find an inner world of strange creatures. Just suspend your belief, and sit back an enjoy this wonderful tale. I experience it first as a movie way back in 1960. Later, I read the novel. Don't miss it.The concept of a hollow earth was not new in Jules Verne's day (mid-1800s). Its most prominent advocate was Capt. John Cleave Symmes, who advanced the theory in about 1818. Symmes was so convincing that in the 1820s he got twenty-five members of the United States Congress to vote to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where they would enter the center of the earth through a 4,000-mile-wide cavity in the earth.It was then believed that the Lost Tribes of Israel lived on the North Pole behind a wall of ice. This theory found its way into the revelations of Joseph Smith, who in the Book of Mormon and later, said that the Lost Tribes would break down the ice and return from the "north countries."Also, check out "At the Earth's Core," by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Land of Terror (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)

This book was one of the most intreguing and memorable books I ever read. When Steven King lamented that "A Kiss Before Dying" was not read much these days, he was right to the mark. Don't miss this great murder mystery. A villan you'll hate in an irresistible story.Be sure to read the Amazon review by Ryan Harvey "Wolf Shadow." Here's a quote from Ryan Harvey's review:"Stephen King once commented about author Ira Levin: 'Every novel he has ever written has been a marvel of plotting. He is the Swiss watchmaker of the suspense novel; he makes what the rest of us do look like those five-dollar watches you can buy in the discount drug stores.' He went on to lament that Levin's most effective book (and his first!), 'A Kiss before Dying,' is not much read these days."

Written in 1964, this novel shows its age. Here is a list of things that caused me to pause (not good for a reader of a thriller). The same novel written today would not have these things:1. Travis McGee is setting up a house-boat party of "four gentlemen and six ladies." Sounds good to me, BUT (page 4): "No drunks, whiners...no dubious gender..."2. Said to be funny (page 166): "Where does responsibility stop? Do you buy a cripple a shoeshine box and send it out into the traffic?" Send "it." That "it" is a person!3. Note the old use of "gay" as happy or fun loving. Page 27: "...the things left hidden from all the gay companions."4. My, how the times have changed. Travis is worried about staying over night to protect an abused and psychologically damaged woman. "Will anybody make any trouble about my staying here?"5. Measurements for women have gone the way of Edsils (page 38). A woman's measurements were important when I was a boy in the 1950s and 60s. Now read this: "Sheilagh Morraine had a sweet, true, ordinary little voice, wooden gestures and expressions, and an astouding 42-25-38 figure..."6. Here's a great line about Cuban radio in 1964 (only five years after the communist revolution): "Voice of the land of peace and freedom and brotherhood. No commericals. Nothing left to sell."Now for something else. The bad guy was always beating up women--even in the daytime. Not that such things don't happen, it just seemed over the top. Also, the women were traumatized not because of rape, but more because of the sex acts themselves. Page 73: "Oh, I will not do that!"The nature of these acts was never made clear, but hinted at, as if the author thought some acts were damaging in their own right. That hasn't translated well from 1964.Here's another attitude problem that Travis Magee (author McDonold) displays about women. Too much violent language (page 269, end of story). "The damned humble, docile, forgiving woman. I wanted to beat her. I wanted to do some ugly thing that would destory that mute earnestness, that anxiety to please me." This leads to another problem. All the women in the story are as weak as the one portraryed here.So much has changed--FOR THE BETTER!!!

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.So, your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie.I've watched "Sabrina" a lot of times, and I always enjoy it. Perhaps the appeal is seeing a wealthy man do the right thing for a change. The chauffeur's daughter returns home from college in France and dazzles the two wealthy brothers at the family estate. From there, the romance and adventure begins.Great fun and highly recommended, and here is another great "chick flick" that men will enjoy, "A Walk in the Clouds."

Note: Some immature Mormon has been slamming my reviews because I wrote some negative reviews of books attempting to defend the Book of Mormon.So your "helpful" votes are greatly appreciated. ThanksIn my opinion, a short review is best if you haven't read the book. I always read the longer reviews afterwards.I read this book forty years ago in college and loved it. I also saw the movie, but as one reviewer pointed out, Phileas Fogg traveled by boat, train, car, sled, and even elephant, but never by balloon. The balloon scene was added to the movie.Nevertheless, I loved all of Jules Verne's stories, and I highly recommend this one, whose title says it all--"Around the World in Eighty Days" on a bet that it couldn't be done.I enjoy collecting paperback books with neat covers, and I have a couple of "Around the World in Eighty Days."Oh, and I hope this is helpful. Read "The Other Log of Phileas Fogg," by Philip Jose Farmer. This retelling of Verne's story has Fogg going after Captain Nemo. It's great Fun. Farmer also wrote novels about Tarzan and the "Barnstormer in Oz"--very sexy.The Other Log of Phileas FoggBarnstormer In Oz/a

This is a great novel and a great movie! Superb!Here's another super coming-of-age novel--"Red Sky At Morning."Red Sky at Morning: A Novel (Perennial Classics)Buy an older paperback copy with the picture of the teenage boy and girl with their foreheads touching (very sweet).On the Wizard of Loneliness, by John Nichols, buy an older paperback with the cover of the boy and girl on the front porch holding a rabbit (a great and tender scene).I also liked "The Sound of Summer Voices," by Helen Tucker.The Sound of Summer VoicesBuy the older paperback with the cover illustration of the boy hiding in the tree and looking down at the young couple kissing.Another great read was "Summer Lightning," by Judith Richards.Summer Lightening

Mormons have been hitting this review. They don't want you to read what a world renown authority on the Maya says. Your positive votes are appreciated. Thanks.Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. His fascinating and heavy book analyses the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.For example, Sharer writes: "After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, "are to be `explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.""The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters." "But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World."The descriptions of Maya civilization given by Sharer stand in marked contrast with the civilizations described in the Book of Mormon. Sharer writes: "Several painted pottery vessels graphically depict the use of an enema apparatus in apparently ritual settings; the direct introduction of alcoholic or hallucinogenic substances into the colon results in immediate absorption by the body, thereby hastening the effect." The purpose was to induce visions in the Maya temples and elsewhere. The hallucinogenic substances used by the Maya included morning glory and the poison glands from tropical toads.Further, nowhere in the North or South America did the civilizations have horses, cattle, sheep, steel weapons, swords, or chariots mentioned in the Book of Mormon.I became fascinated with the ancient Maya when some Mormon missionaries showed me "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon, by Milton R. Hunter." Because this book (2 vols) presented evidence that was the exact opposite of what I had learned in my basic anthropology class, I investigated Dr. Hunter's sources. Alas, they did not check out.One example was Hunter's "valuable Book of Mormon evidence" that showed him standing by a wall pointing to a Maya carving on the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itza, Mexico. The carving was supposed to represent a "horse." After much research, and not finding any reference to a carving of a horse at Chichen Itza, I discovered that the carving was the damaged portion of a backwards figure "S" jaguar serpent (a feather is the horse's head).A detailed rubbing of the stone can be seen in the "Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel," by Ralph Roys (University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, 1967), plate 1.Further, nowhere in the North or South America did the civilizations have horses, cattle, sheep, steel weapons, swords, or chariots mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The Maya of real history were so ignorant of horses that when Cortes left his lame horse in the care of the Itza Maya, they fed it meat. The animal, of course, died from this strange diet.Terrified, the Maya erected a statue in the shape of a tapir, the closest approximation to a horse in their environment. They worshipped this "horse" as Tzimin Chac, after Tzimin, the tapir, whose profile roughly resembles a horse, no other animal save the deer even approximating the alien animal.In short, every Mormon and non-Mormon should read Sharer's book. Two other books on archaeology that I highly recommend are: "The Mound Buiders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg, and "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians," by Robert Wauchope.

Yes, see the movie "Stand by Me." It took me right back. Those boys walking down the railroad tracks were my friends and me. I even knew an Ace Merrill, but "Big Al" was nice to us boys.At the beginning of "Stand by Me" when Richard Dryfus is remembering the good old days, you can really feel it--especially as BB King's "Stand by Me" is played in the background. A scene of only a minute--so poignant!One night we took off on our bicycles and raided a driving range, filling two five-gallon buckets with beat-up range balls that had been left out. What an adventure! Also, a crime. Oops! Does this post count as a legal confession?

Note: I received a personal email from one of the researchers for Michener's novels. He gave me a thumbs up on this review. Nice, and thanks.Obviously, from the votes, some people don't like Michener's comments about the name "Jehovah," but they won't attempt to refute it. Intellectual honesty requires that if you don't agree with Mchener, then you must refute him.As always, Michener fills his novels with fascinating historical facts and insights. The start thousands of years into the past and take the reader to the present day.I've read several of his novels, and I would say this one is the best--a sweaping drama about the rise of the Jews from earliest times to the present. Michener's comments on the word "Jehovah" are interesting in light of its modern use by the "Jehovah's Witnesses" and in the last lines of the Book of Mormon."(Since) any deity must be referred to in some manner the custom had grown up of calling YHWH by the arbitrary Hebrew word `Adonai,' which would later be translated into other languages as Lord. When the vowel indications for `Adonai' were added tot eh letters YHWH, a curious symbol developed which German scholars many centuries later would mistakenly read as Jehovah, a word that had never existed and that had never in any way been applied to the austere Hebrew deity. Thus the greatest of Gods was called YHWH, which had no pronunciation; he was known to ordinary Jews as `Adonai,' which was purely arbitrary; and he would conquer the world as Jehovah, a name which had never belonged to him or to anything else" (p. 399).

Whitcomb is an great writer who makes you care about the characters: hate some, love others. The author draws you into her story and won't let you go. I found myself turning pages as I followed Helen (a ghost, or spirit) through her trials and finding true love. I don't want to give anything away; just trust me that this clever story will stay with you long after you put the book down.Some reviewers and bloggers fretted about the sex scenes. They are out to lunch. There are no porno scenes, and the average high-school student will love the story. But remember this is NOT a YA novel. Adults will enjoy it the most.If you don't like the religious scenes, you probably see yourself in one of the wacko parents in the story. I've known people like that.If you like ghost stories, then I recommend the dead detective series (three as of now, and all grabbers). The first two were written under the pseudynim Chaz McGee, and the others under the author's real name, Katy Munger, another super writer.Angel Interrupted (A Dead Detective Mystery)Desolate Angel (A Dead Detective Mystery)Angel of Darkness (Dead Detective)

Your "helpful" votes are greatly appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great movie. I've just noted the general theme.Don't be put off by the title "Donnie Darko." This weird time-travel movie, involving other dimensions, is great. There's a witch in it, but it's hard to describe, so as an older guy who often doesn't care for teenage movies, I'll just give it two thumbs up. I was surprised that I liked it so much.When so many movies are the same, it's nice to find something original, and I hope to see more such efforts.Here are some other cult movies that I would highly recommend.1. "Blue Velvet" (a weird murder mystery set in recent times).Blue Velvet (Special Edition)2. Lantana (Australian murder mystery set in modern times)Lantana3. Walkabout (also an Australian mystery adventure about two white children who join up with an Aborigine boy after their father commits suicide in the middle of the outback. A great adventure).Walkabout - Criterion Collection4. The Jacket (a strand time-travel mystery set in a mental institution).The Jacket

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.If you haven't seen "O Brother, Where Art Thou," you've really missed a great movie. Very roughly based on events in Homer's "Odyssey," this is a tale of three convicts who escape from a chain-gang in the 1930s. Their adventures are crazy, but insightful into the south during the Depression.There are actually a lot of elements from the "Odyssey." The convicts meet three "sirens." A man running for governor has the first name of "Homer," another man is blind in one eye, and in the end, the men wind up in a courthouse where "Ulysses" metaphorically slays the "suitor" of his wife.In their over-the-top journey to find a stash of robbery money, they are involved in one incident after another that perfectly catches the spirit of America during the Depression.The music is wonderful, and the songs and comedy will stay with you forever--"Man of Constant Sorrow" and "Let's Meet at the River to Pray" to mention two of the wonderful songs.I've watched in many times. Highly recommended.

I was hooked on the plot, but too many things didn't add up. Fine, Coltrane hides in the hills and takes pictures of a Serbian warlord digging up bodies of the men, women, and children he murdered. The pictures could be used in a crimes-against-humanity trial. This "beefy faced" warlord wants Coltrane's head. This is okay, but then Coltrane flees to LA and the warlord follows him. This one guy places bugs in the houses of all Coltrane's friends, and in the house of an anti-terrorist commando. Then this ONE guy blows up the car of the commando, killing many bystanders in the daytime. He has also planted bombs in the houses of other people. NOW: the beefy faced guy flies to New York from LA and hangs Coltrane's grandparents! Hangs them in their basement. Then he flies back to LA to do more killings.The hangings of Coltrane's grandparents killed the novel for me. This ONE guy is doing all these things? Also, if he was enraged by Coltrane's pictures, why didn't he have Cortrane killed by some American gangster who could pass in the US?The plot just DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. It is one thing to suspend belief, and I was willing to do it. Then the hangings of the grandparents came along, and I closed the book.I had such great hopes! To read 162 pages, and then give up because the author over-did the plot and had two stories going. The mystery of the photograph who photographed houses in the 1930s was interesting, but the beefy faced Serbian warlord who had his pictures in the paper and could still come to the US and kill people right and left was TOO much. Too bad.

Note: Some immature Mormon is angry over my negative reviews of books written to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksMy review is short and to the point. In my opinion, it's better to read the longer reviews after you see the movie or read the book.One night a boy calls a radio program to ask how his father can find a new wife. Then the father calls in, and the wheels of romance start to turn.I don't like to tell too much about a movie, but this film will stay with you for years.I would tell men to see it with their wives or girlfriends. It's the kind of feel-good movie that doesn't come along enough nowadays. Men, you will love this movie.Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are perfect together.

This super novel naturally bears the marks of having been written in 1958, which it was. The man jokes with his pregnant wife that he might hit her in the belly. An author attempting to gain sympathy for the main character would never use such a "joke" today. Also, writing styles change. Matheson loaded his sentences with adjectives and adverbs. This practice has been trimmed away by modern writers. Nevertheless, I loved the story and kept turning the pages right to the end. I'd like to find another novel like it.Aside from being a great ghost story, the novel is worth reading for the haunting lines from "Chambers of Imagery," a poem by in the frontis.Sometimes within the brain's oldghostly house,I hear, far off, at some forgottendoor,A music and an eerie faint carouseAnd stir of echoes down thecreaking floor.I read the "Stir of Echoes" one afternoon while killing some time in the long lobby of a tropical hotel in Puerto Rico. Outside the palms were blowing in the breeze, and I kept turning back to that poem. I didn't interpret it as creepy. Rather, I found it extremely nostalgic. I read the whole novel that magical afternoon.I would also highly recommend "The Dead Detective" series by McGee. As of now, there are only two: "Desolate Angel" and "Angel Interrupted," but they are super. The second one is even better than the first. The author "Chaz McGee" is actually a pseudonym--forget her name??? A police detective is murdered and comes back as a ghost to find out who did it. A wonderful get-lost story.Desolate Angel (A Dead Detective Mystery)Angel Interrupted (A Dead Detective Mystery)

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.I've watched this movie many times. It really requires concentration, and I think it has to be watched several times. I don't like long reviews for movies I haven't seen, so I'll be brief for those who haven't seen "Mulholland Drive."The movie begins with a young women is sitting in the backseat of a fancy car at night. The car pulls over, and just as one of the men in the front seat is about to shoot her, a carload of teenagers crashes into them, killing them all except for the young women. The woman wanders down the hill to Mulholland Drive, sleeps outside behind some shrubs, then sneaks into a condo, where she is found by the new resident (another young woman--actually the same woman).Like I say, you just have to watch the movie several times to catch everything. It's very strange with some fantastic scenes.The cowboy scene is worth the whole movie. It's really funny, but done in a deadly serious manner. Super!

I was lost in the adventures of Sir. Richard Burton on the ten-million-mile river of "Riverworld," where everyone who has ever lived wakes up from death. This is not a heaven, though! There is wild sex, and also the possibility of dying again. Mark Twain has Alice-in-Wonderland as his lover! The characters from real history build a riverboat and head up the river. Toward the end, they go flying around on comfortable overstuffed chairs. Great fun!

This is movie that I often put in my little box TV and watch while I play on the Internet. It's a slow rolling mystery that gets to you, and it has an wonderfully unexpected ending. Highly recommended for people who love slow-rolling mysteries without a lot of blood and guts.An English woman and writer of mysteries needs a change of pace, and her publisher gives her the keys to his villa in southern France. There is, of course, a swimming pool and a murder. That's enough for those who haven't seen this sexy movie.Why can't they produce more good mysteries? I hate it when there is so much action that the plot is lost. I like a movie with a solid plot, characters that I care about, and filmed in a way the evokes mystery. If I ask, where is this all leading and I finally get there, then it's a great movie.Five stars for Swimming Pool.

The subtleties and doubtful sources used by Givens earned him a one-star review in my opinion. The more I studied Givens' book the more I found it to be a highly flawed piece of religious propaganda. One Mormon reviewer said:"Givens shows that competent Saints are not trying to discover some dramatic archaeological evidence, as sectarian critics demand, that would "prove" the Book of Mormon. Instead, the increasingly sophisticated efforts of the book's defenders to draw upon literary, historical, and anthropological support for the ancient origin of the Book of Mormon has forced its more honest, better-informed detractors to abandon earlier explanations and to search for explanations of its authorship."First of all, it is a fact that the LDS Church has spent millions of dollars funding archaeological excavations in Central America with the purpose of finding evidence for the Book of Mormon. Nothing has been found to indicate that Nephites ever existed, but non-Mormon archaeologists are grateful for the funding of these projects.Second, the notion (and I emphasize "notion") that the Book of Mormon contains information that was not known in Joseph Smith's day is without foundation. In uncritically accepting the scholarship produced by FARMS (the BYU think-tank), Givens has committed a fatal error. He has four references to "chiasmus" in the Book of Mormon. These examples of chiasmus, or parallelisms in Hebrew poetry, are cited as proof that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document because chiasmus was unknown in Joseph Smith's day.NOTHING, and I emphasize "nothing," could be further from the truth. Rather than being unknown, these parallelisms in biblical poetry were common knowledge among people interested in the Bible.I own a copy of Thomas Hartwell Horne's "An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures." This four-volume book was advertised for sale in 1825 in Palmyra on the front page of the Wayne Sentinel (April 6, 13, 20). The long ad outlines the entire content of Horne's massive work, including "the Poetry of the Hebrews and Harmony of the Scriptures" (quoted from the front-page advertisement).Horne's book is full of diagrams and commentary on Hebrew poetry showing these parallelisms. The diagrams and commentary are also found in all editions Robert Lowth's "Isaiah" that have a "Preliminary Dissertation." They are found, of course, in Lowth's massively detailed "Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews." The diagrams serve as how-to examples of how to write pieces of Hebrew poetry.Another book on parallelisms is "An Essay on Hebrew Poetry Ancient and Modern" (London, 1824), by Philip Sarchi.The United States was awash in cheap books in Joseph Smith's youth. Some two-hundred-book wagons roamed the country selling books. In other words, the bookstore came to the farm, and these sellers accepted produce in payment for books. Bookstores also accepted "clean rags." These facts are not mentioned by Givens or other Mormon scholars. One Erie Canal boat was made into a floating bookstore.The book trade between the United States and England was impressive--some 2.5 million dollars in 1823, and it made no difference whatsoever if a book was published in London or New York. It was available. American editions of British books were so cheap and popular in England that British publishers complained that the Americans were violating copyright laws. The Americans were amused and continued to manufacture the books.References to Palmyra as a "wilderness" or a "frontier" are not justified by reality. Palmyra was settled farming community with some manufacturing, and right on the Erie Canal, the freeway of its day (opened to Palmyra several years before its official dedication in 1825--there is an 1821 lock in Palmyra).One Palmyra newspaper ad had some 200 books advertised on the front page in 1818--more histories and more religious books than you will ever see in a Sunday newspaper today. One traveling show with an elephant came through Palmyra, and the biblical "witch of Endor" was even in Palmyra as part of a traveling wax museum. Not quite the world painted by Mormon scholars.The Hebrew origin of the American Indians found front-age coverage in 1825 in the speech of Mordecai Noah when he founded "A World Refuge for the Jews" at "Ararat" on an island in the Niagara River at Buffalo ("Noah's Ark" with Indians aboard sailed the Erie Canal). I own many books about the Hebrew origins of the American Indians published in Joseph Smith's youth.As for the Erie Canal, it is eye-opening that Henry and Elihu Phinney imported books straight from New York City and Philadelphia and distributed them throughout the towns and villages of upstate New York. The Phinney brothers used large book wagons with moveable tops and counters. They even converted a canal boat into a floating bookstore (see Margaret T. Hills, "The English Bible in America," p. 69).These facts about the distribution of religious books and histories are not mentioned in Given's book, nor in the books by Richard Bushman, another Mormon historian. Regrettably, both these scholars uncritically accept the claims made by FARMS and also the bogus "scholarship" of Hugh Nibley, whoses sources do not check out.In contrast to the real world of Joseph Smith's youth, Givens has constructed a sophisticated, though false, architecture. By ignoring the real world of books in America, these scholars produce arguments that are satisfying to educated Mormons who do not have the time or inclination to explore the sources used by this new generation of Mormon scholars.A false methodology: By tracing words back to the beginning of time, it is easy to produce boatloads of outwardly impressive commentary. Such word games satisfy those who demand a sophisticated answer to criticisms of the Book of Mormon. In this, the "scholarship" churned out by FARMS, for example, is a house of cards that Mormon intellectuals uncritically accept.Here is an example: In an article entitled "How Could Joseph Smith Write So Accurately About Ancient America?" BYU scholar John Sorenson says of Humboldt's book ("Researches" about ancient America) that: "Besides, the chance is vanishingly small that the learned German's esoteric work would have been accessible anywhere in America except at a handful of the best libraries on the Atlantic seaboard, to which Joseph Smith had no access before the Book of Mormon was published" (p. 274).Such an erudite display of confidence in speaking absolute nonsense.In fact, Humboldt's "History of New Spain" was advertised for sale on the front page of the "Palmyra Register" (Oct. 6, 1818). Thus, it is highly likely that his "Researches" was also advertised (the newspaper issues are incomplete). My copy Humboldt's book has a color engraving of a leaf from the Maya "Dresden Codex" as well as an engraving of the Aztec calendar stone.In other words, all the materials needed for producing the "Anthon Transcript" were available in Palmyra. All kinds of "fac-simlies" of ancient codices were available to the farmers and townsfolk of the Palmyra area. This is a fact that all Americans should be proud of, not something to hide, which FARMS has done with impressive subtly. Think about it: a page of the Dresden Maya Codex was probably in Palmyra in the early 1800s.On page 119, Givens uncritically quotes Hugh Nibley, who had the bizarre idea that: "If you want proof of the Book of Mormon, you must go to the Old World. You won't find it in the New World."Such nonsense--where were the Book of Mormon civilizations? In the Old World or the New? And, why won't we find proof of the Book of Mormon in the New World? Because Nibley thinks the Nephites lived in "quickly built wooden cities." Hence, quickly disappearing.I must mention another thing Nibley wrote: "The only weapons that have survived from prehistoric times are far more suited to their purpose than a modern rifle. The deadliest of all hunting weapons remains to this day the stone-headed (not steel-headed arrow)." Parenthesis by Nibley.Modern rifle and bow hunters raise your hand if you believe this! Nibley's weird theories should be an embarrassment to educated Mormons. In "In Lehi in the Desert" (p. 32), Nibley said Joseph Smith was "illiterate" and Cowdery "half-educated."These are completely unfair descriptions of both men. An illiterate translator? Now that's a new idea, as well as the Jaredites living in a "dateless age." What's that mean? Givens didn't ask.Givens writes (p. 50): "Looking out upon a quarter-million of his own dead, (Mormon) records his pathetic farewell...." Where did these quarter-million die? Where exactly? That is a lot of bones and weapons. In Nibley's "Old World," or the New? Neither writer provides an answer.Givens refers to the Jaredites many times, but he fails to even mention the Jaredite voyage in 2,000 BC voyage aboard submarines for 344 days. By ignoring the fanciful Jaredite voyage, Givens has conceded that it cannot be defended as real history.In short, the Book of Mormon stands in stark contrast to the findings of New World archaeology. Consider Robert J. Sharer's heavy and authoritative 753-page "The Ancient Maya." Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, at the University of Pennsylvania. Sharer writes:"After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6).After reading Givens' book, I shook my head in disbelief that "Oxford University Books" would even publish it.If you what a fair and unbiased history, then read another book. If you want a faith massage, then you will love this book. Producing a book full of footnotes and fine print does not necessarily make that book a fair or honest history.Please read my reviews of other Mormon books and my non-Mormon listmania.Echoes and Evidences of the Book of MormonYour comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

I agree with another reviewer. "Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism" is an interesting and provocative defense of the sacred story. Bushman is an elegant historian with a special skill in defending the faith story. That his arguments are as successful as they are is a measure of his historical versimilitude. While it is an important synthesis, Bushman's book will be acceptable mostly to believing Mormons."I do admire Bushman for his honesty in praising Fawn Brodie's "No Man Knows My History." "As notable for its journalistic brilliance as for its scholarship, 'No Man Knows My History' presented Riley's arguments and findings in a form more palatable to twentieth century tastes."Such an honest appraisal would never have happened in the decades following Brodie's 1946 book. It might have even earned Bushman excommunication. Wow, how times have changed.See my 3-star review of Bushman's "Rough Stone Rolling."Joseph Smith: Rough Stone RollingI agree that it was brilliantly written and well researched, but it did have some significant errors.Also see my one-star (less if I could) of Hartt Wixom's "Critiquing the Critics."Critiquing the Critics of Joseph SmithI also gave one-star reviews to Hugh Nibley's books.Lehi in the Desert, the World of the Jaredites, There Were Jaredites (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 5)Since Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern worldandAn Approach to the Book of Mormon (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 6)Another one-star for: "Echoes and Evidences," a collection of articles edited by Donald W. Parry, Daniel C. Peterson, and John W. Welch. This book earned it's one star. See:Echoes and Evidences of the Book of MormonAlso one star is John L.

Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book.Will Durant's writing is brilliant. Here is what he wrote about Spinoza's open-mindedness in seeking the truth:"He read in Maimonides a half-favorable discussion of the doctrine of Averroes,that immortality is impersonal; but he found in the 'Guide to the Perplexed' more perplexities than guidance. For the great Rabbi propounded more questions than he answered; and Spinoza found the contradictions and improbabilities of the Old Testament lingering in his thought long after the solutions of Maimonides had dissolved into forgetfulness."Here is another classic line by Will Durant: "The greatest defenders of a faith are its greatest enemies, for their subtleties engender doubt and stimulate the mind."And of Spinoza's excommunication from the Amsterdam synagogue,Durant wrote that it was nothing for: "Fate had written that Spinoza should belong to the world."

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. You don't want to re-tell the whole story. I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book. In my opinion, you should read long reviews after you read the novel. Read a short review first.It's hard to say which of King's novels is the best, but for a long novel, this has got to be it. Don't start reading this end-of-civilization story if you want some free time in the next little while.Why is it that most people love to read about the total destruction of civilization (in this case by disease)? We can't help following the few survivors on a great quest to solve a mystery--breaking into banks, taking jewelry, etc. All rules gone! The appeal of easy wealth? But it's all worthless without civilization.Anyway, read this story. I loved it. You'll never look at Las Vegas the same way again.Also, along the same lines is "Swan's Song," by Robert McCammon.Swan SongAnother highly recommended end-of-world novel is Walter Miller's "Canticle for Leibowitz."A Canticle for Leibowitz (Bantam Spectra Book)Still another is "Lucifer's Hammer," by Larry Nivin & Jerry Pournelle Lucifer's Hammer

Note: Your helpful votes are appreciated. Thanks.Nick Nolte is perfect in this movie set in 1950s Los Angeles. It has a well-developed plot that slowly unfolds. A young woman is found dead, having been thrown from an airplane, but the crime is not as simple as it appears. The military is involved in a cover-up on atomic bomb testing.That's enough. After you see the movie, read a longer review."Mulholland Falls" is the kind of mystery you wait months and months to appear. PS: the "falls" doesn't refer to a waterfall.I also highly recommend "Lantana" (an Australian mystery) and "Mulholland Drive" (set in Hollywood).

An eccentric father packs up his family and moves from the midwest to the Mosquito Coast of Honduras. His plan is to make a wondrous change in the lives of the Maya Indians by providing them with ice. What a character! What an adventure! A compelling story told with humor, a modern voyage into the heart of darkness.The "Chicago Sun-Times" book review said, "The 'Mosquito Coast' is rich beyond compare...exhilarating and provocative, fun and terrifying."Highly recommended!

Give me a break. That person's faith must be very fragile, indeed. Oh, well.I'm trying to be "helpful," and you can see that it took some work to put this review together.So, your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and I hope you find some enjoyable quotations (below) from Boswell's wonderful book, but first a little history.Samuel Johnson, the irascible but generous lexicographer of the eighteenth century, is mostly remembered because of Boswell, and Boswell is remembered because he wrote Johnson's biography.At the time, Johnson was already famous for his "Dictionary of the English Language," an impressive work for the year 1755. Among many other writings, Johnson put out an edition of Shakespeare's works (1765), with valuable notes that are still referred to today.Johnson published a "series of grave and moral discourses" in the periodical called the Rambler, but when it was translated into Italian, it came out as the ludicrous "El Vagabondo," something far from Johnson's pious intentions. And of good intentions, it was Johnson who said, "Sir, Hell is paved with good intentions.""(Johnson's) defense of tea against Mr. Jonas Hanway's violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage, shows how very well a man of genius can write upon the slightest subject, when he writes, as the Italians say, con amore."Johnson despised Americans and was prejudiced against Scotland. He said, "Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel."Johnson was a male chauvinist. Yet, he was "a king of men." He was a "robust genius, born to grapple with whole libraries," and although "indolence and procrastination were inherent in his constitution, whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one else."As a person who is afraid of death in the normal sense, I was surprised that in spite of being very religious, Johnson had an extreme fear of death. "'The better a man is, the more afraid he is of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity.' Said Boswell, "Johnson owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation, was mysterious; and said, 'Ah! We must wait till we are in another state of being, to have many things explained to us.' Even the powerful mind of Johnson seemed foiled by futurity."Boswell's commentary brings to mind a story told by St. Augustine in his monumental City of God. A philosopher was abroad a ship captained by a bad man, and after a violent storm, the fearless captain jeered the philosopher for his terror. Said the philosopher, quoting from a similar incident that occurred to the pagan Aristippus, 'A rogue need not worry about losing his worthless life, but Aristippus has a duty to care for a life like his.""Johnson knew more books than any man alive. He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book, without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end." But he also held that it was important to "read diligently the great book of mankind.""Why, Sir, I am a man of the world. I live in the world, and I take, in some degree, the color of the world as it moves along."Johnson was also the one who said, "When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.""I love Blair's Sermons," Johnson said. "Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and every thing that he should not be, I was the first to praise them. Such was my candor," he said with a smile."

With terrific acting and a compelling plot, you are caught up in the life of an innocent man accused of murder and sent to the notorious "Shawshank" prison in Maine.This is the kind of movie that you will walk away from feeling inspired about the determination of human beings not only to survive but to triumph.Read my short review, then see the movie.

I would recommend this book just for the introductory essay (see below).[Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.]So your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksKing is a master writer, and I enjoyed this collection. I loved "Umney's Last Case" (evocative of 1930s crime fiction). Also liked the "House on Maple Street" (it kept me turning the pages).The book is worth it for the introductory essay by Steven King. Here are some of the great lines from that essay, and I hope they make my short review worth reading.Steven King wrote:"When I was a kid I believed everything I was told, everything I read, and every dispatch sent out by my own overheated imagination. This made for more than a few sleepless nights, but it also filled the world I lived in with colors and textures I would not have traded for a lifetime of restful nights. I knew even then, you see, that there were people in the world--too many of them, actually--whose imaginative senses were eight numb or completely deadened, and who lived in a mental state skin to colorblindness."Robert McCammon said something similar his brilliant coming-of-age novel, "Boy's Life""See, this is my opinion: we all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up, for God's sake. And you know why we were told that? Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic they knew made them ashamed and sad of what they'd allowed to wither in themselves."

It ends, of course, with the famous scenes on Mount Rushmore.I'll keep my review short. Longer reviews are best read after seeing the movie. Nevertheless, I would note that I was surprised at all the sexual innuendo in this movie. I wasn't offended, but Hitchcock was way ahead of its time on that score. The two lovers were really hot.I think we show too much nowadays and loose some of the mystery of sexual encounters. Just talking around a subject can be very sensual.I would also recommend "Vertigo," by Alfred Hitchcock. This is one of the ten best movies ever made--very compelling.Alfred Hitchcock The Masterpiece Collection - Psycho / The Trouble With Harry / The Man Who Knew Too Much / Vertigo (DVD)

What is the number one rule of novel writing? Does the reader care about the main character? Sadly--and with initial great hopes--I gave up caring as the pages meandered along, and I quit reading about page 60. The story just wasn't going anywhere to the point that I had to read some reviews and found myself agreeing with the negative reviews, especially the one star reviews.There was an old Twilight episode where an author had a strange tape recorder that created characters: he created a perfect wife. That was at least intreguing. Not so with this story. You've got to get the plot going before page 30, and by page 60, I was lost, bored, and disappointed that I had not picked up a grabber.Want a grabber? Try Charles DeLint,"Trader," where a young punk wakes up in the body of an old man, and the old man wakes up in the body of the young punk! Problem: the punk now has all the old man's money and property. From page one, the plot took hold.TraderOr, try Andrew Klavan, "Animal Hour," where a lawyer goes to her office and nobody recognizes her!The Animal Hour

Note: There are a couple Mormons who are angry over my negative reviews of books written in defense of the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.I don't like telling the whole plot of novels. Long reviews are better to read after you've read the novel, itself. A short review that can capture the "hook" can still be a good review. So here it is:The hero goes into a basement in Arizona and finds a lute in a closet. He strums it, and a gate into another world opens. He finds himself in a land as large and wild as the wild west, but also full of gates that allow him to walk between worlds.Philip Jose Farmer is probably the most imaginative writer I've ever read. The hero passes through many gates into other worlds in a great series of adventures.In illustration of Farmer's wonderful imagination, take note of the idea that the stars are NOT suns but actually small dots in the sky. In another case, there is a floating village that travels about thirty feet above the ground. It is held up by gas bags.I loved this series, and I would rank it the equal to the Riverworld series. I'll write a bit about Riverworld (the first is "To Your Scattered Bodies Go") to encourage you to read it.In "Riverworld," Farmer probably created the most original fantasy ever written. Everyone who has ever lived wakes up from death on the banks of a ten-million-mile river on a strange planet. They are all young again, and the first thing they do is engage in a vast orgy in this false heaven (where you can die and wake up again).Each morning a bucket full of toiletries and food appears at these giant mushroom structures--one bucket for each person. Later, the characters go flying around in armchairs--what a way the fly!The hero is Sir. Richard Burton, and Farmer's choice was perfect. Mark Twain and Alice in Wonderland are also in the story, as well as Hermon Goring (the Nazi). They build a riverboat and set out on a bunch of great adventures.I don't want to tell too much, but I would rank the "Riverworld" series in the top three fantasies I have ever read. Highly recommended.Read the World of Tier's first.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.There are a lot of psychological and social theories about "Robinson Crusoe," but I just take it as a grand adventure. I loved all the details of how he survived after being shipwrecked on that island. Just remember that it was written in the seventeenth century so you have to get used to writing.I have a warm place in my heart for Robinson Crusoe. Some fifty years ago in the second grade, my teacher read it to our class. Decades later, I told my wife about it, but she said that it was impossible. Robinson Crusoe is too difficult for a teacher to read to second graders.Well, several years went by, and I was proved right. In a used bookstore, I bought a copy of "The Story of Robinson Crusoe in words of One Syllable," with "Colored Illustrations." The book was published in about 1900, and when my teacher read it to her class, the book was over fifty years old.Since then I have collected paperback editions of "Robinson Crusoe" for their neat covers, and this one is really nice.If you like shipwrecked-on-an-island stories, read Richard Laymon's "Island." It's a page-turner of a modern murder mystery.Island

If you liked this book, I appreciate your open-mindedness in reading this negative review. Also, a negative review can be helpful. I'll say this. It was an entertaining read, but--I enjoyed the first part of this morality tale (follow your dreams, a good message). But--but it was so bound up in the literal belief in omens. It is one thing to take opportunities, be daring, and strike out in new directions, but to march humanity back into the dark ages is something else.Hundreds of thousands of innocent people have died because of the belief in omens and other superstitions. The author of this book never addressed that essential question.I agree that we should follow our dreams, but this parable went too far overboard.I have traveled by bus and jeep across North Africa, and through Egypt and down through the Sudan, Ethiopia, and I can promise you that Mr. Coelho has romanticized nomadic life way out of realistic proportions.Also, the ending is old and predetermined from the beginning. The boy goes out searching for his dream and found it was back home all along. As a story, I would give it a higher rating, but the author really didn't deal with the hard problems of life.One critic said the "Little Prince" was a lot better. An Amazon reviewer of the "Little Prince" said that the narrator describes "his view of the world when he was a child and how adults could never understand the real meaning of things or perceive truth in the world--only the superficial and the usual. This is generally one of the main ideas of the book; "blessed are the children...". The rest of the book is the story of the little prince, whom the narrator discovers in the Sahara when he is trying to fix his downed airplane and is in fear of his life."Sounds good. I think I'll read this classic of French literature.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.Wouldn't is be nice if the person who automatically slams my reviews would grow up? All I did was criticise some common ignorant claims about the Maya that are made by some Mormons, but this person has no answer to what I am saying and can't handle it. How about leaving a comment with some mature criticism?I gave this book 5 stars for an effort to prove the Book of Mormon that turned into an amusing display of pseudo-science. The author, Mr. Hamby, explains to the reader that: "Using spiritual truth as a bases for examining the cultures of ancient America is a method which is not likely to be accepted by scientists. They base their truth on the tangible evidence which they can see and feel; and right so, for their particular discipline demands such" (p. 9).Very funny. Hamby has just admitted that his "evidence" won't pass muster with the experts.The one picture of a metal "plate" from Ecuador is really funny. It shows a pyramid and on the sides are elephants. On either side of the pyramid are large felines that look like house cats.The caption reads, "The pyramid in similar to the Masonic-style one on the back of the US one-dollar bill." Hello! Hint, hint. A modern local artist copied it from a dollar! The "plate" is obviously modern even to the untrained eye.Very amusing and a classic in bogus archaeology. It should embarrass educated Mormons.

I saw the movie fifty years ago as a child, and later read the novel. The images have stayed with me all these years.What a debt we owe to Jules Verne for taking us so many fantastic places!As for the ecology of the island, I think some readers are taking the story too seriously. Just lay back and have a great adventure. It's easy to pass over the things that we wouldn't do today. If they had turned the island into a nature preserve, there wouldn't be the same wondrous story.Ten stars if I could give that many!And if you like lost-on-an-island adventures, be sure to read Richard Laymon's "Island."

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks. A couple Mormon readers have given me negative marks because of my reviews of books in defense of the Book of Mormon. Oh, well, I write my reviews for fun and as a little hobby.Most educated people are familiar with Emerson's epigrams of wisdom, but there is a whole world to explore in his essays and poems. "The Portable Emerson" gives the reader an excellent overview of Emerson's major works.Emerson's comments in the "American Scholar" about his own time place our age in perspective:"Our age is bewailed as the age of introversion. Must that needs be evil. We, it seems, are critical; we are embarrassed with second thoughts; we cannot enjoy any thing for hankering to know whereof the pleasure consists; we are lined with eyes; we see with our feet; the time is infected with Hamlet's unhappiness,--'Sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought.'"I hope you find something you like in my little review. Here is part of "The Problem," a poem:I like a church; I like a cowl; (cowl: a monk's hooded cloak)I love a prophet of the soul;And on my heart monastic aislesFall like sweet strains, or pensive smiles;Yet not for all his faith can seeWould I that cowled churchman be.A poem: "The Rhodora: On Being Asked, Whence Is The Flower?""Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.""Merlin," a poem:"But mount to paradiseBy the stairway of surprise."And always remember the "Concord Hymn" (sung on July 4, 1837 at the dedication of the monument at Concord). Today near the bridge, there are some British flags to mark the graves of two of the King's soldiers. There are some neat unidentified lines that might have come from Emerson."Here lie two British soldiers who sailed three thousand miles across the ocean to keep the past upon the throne.""By the rude bridge that arched the flood,Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,Here once the embattled farmers stoodAnd fired the shot heard round the world."

Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. A short review that leads the read to a great novel can still be a good review. Thanks.Don't start reading this novel. You'll be up all night. A man, his brother, and the brother's friend, stumble onto the wreck of a small plane, and inside, they find 4.5 million dollars in cash. So what to do with the money? They decide to keep it, of course, making a bargain that the one brother will hold it for six months.I really don't want to say anymore about the plot. It goes red (as in blood) from that day. A "Simple Plan" turns out to be far from simple. Well, that's all I'll say. I don't want to spoil this fast-paced novel. Five stars!PS: I heard that the movie version is the pits.

Thanks for reading my short review. Check out the longer ones for more detail, or watch the movie first, then read the long reviews.First of all, I love foreign films, but at first I wondered about this movie. It wasn't long, however, before I was hooked and had to watch it to the end. There were so many tangled vines of a relationship of a son and father, another of a daughter and mother, and then these relationships begin to intersect.The story takes place in Germany and Turkey. A young Turkish woman is arrested as a member of a terrorist organization, and that pulls a young German woman into this convoluted tale. The woman hides a gun, and when it is found, an unintentional killing occurs.I don't want to reveal too much. The story weaves along right to the end, leaving you with a sense that everything will be okay.The movie is so convoluted that it's best to watch it yourself. Highly recommended!

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksI won't go into all the details of how the birds attack a small town. Longer reviews are best read after you see the movie, in my opinion. What I liked the most was the recapturing of rural California of the 1950. The roads, the small town, the cars, they really take you back.Considering the time, the special effects are really great, too.My favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie (a great mystery) is "Vertigo." "Vertigo" has so much to think about, and the romance is perfect. Highly recommended.I would recommend buying a collection. You'll find many Hitchcock movies that you'll love.Alfred Hitchcock The Masterpiece Collection - The Birds / Marnie / Torn Curtain / Topaz (DVD)

In looking at "Ancient America and the Book of Mormon" published in 1950, it is fascinating that one of the authors lost his faith. Thomas Stewart Ferguson was a life-long defender of the Book of Mormon and founder of the Mormon New World Archaeological Association.In the early 1960s when the Egyptian papyri from which Joseph Smith translated the pamphlet-sized Book of Abraham were located, however, Ferguson sent copies to four different scholars without telling them that the papyri had anything to do with Joseph Smith. He just wanted their opinion. The result was a loss of faith: Ferguson wrote:"Since four scholars, who have established that they can read Egyptian, say that the manuscripts deal with neither Abraham nor Joseph--and since the four reputable men tell us exactly what the manuscripts do say--I must conclude that Joseph Smith had not the remotest skill in things Egyptian--hieroglyphics."Yet, in spite of his lost faith, Ferguson remained a quiet member. He took a philosophical view that people have to believe in something, and that the Mormon religion was better than the rest. The fact that Ferguson remained a member of the Mormon Church only seems odd to those who are uninformed about its pervasive influence, and especially to those who have not witnessed that influence in their own families.The social pressure to either believe or keep your mouth shut is "totally awesome." I bet I can name 20 people who are still on the membership lists but are afraid--or too intimidated--to get their names taken off. I'm just telling like it is from knowing a lot of Mormons and former Mormons who are still technically members. In short, church membership statistics are joke.There is more to the Ferguson story: In 1958 before he lost his faith, Ferguson wrote One Fold and One Shepherd, a display of bogus or equivocal archaeological "evidence" for the Book of Mormon. Then some four years AFTER Ferguson died an edited edition of his book was published under the title The Messiah in Ancient America (1987--I own both books).When Dr. Paul R. Cheesman of BYU wrote the forward, he had no shame. Without mentioning that Ferguson had died not believing in his own book or the Book or Mormon, Dr. Cheesman said, "(This) book should reinstate Thomas Stuart Ferguson as a source of enrichment in the fields of study concerning Mesoamerica and the Book of Mormon."The reader unfamiliar with Ferguson's loss of faith would never know the significance of the word "reinstate." Those who do know its significance can only shake their heads in dismay, wondering why reinstatement was necessary if he died a believer?Cheesman, whose book "These Early Americans" is brimming with false footnotes, was part of an effort to paint over Ferguson's loss of faith.There was, of course, no mention by Cheessman of Ferguson's pointed question to Hugh Nibley, the big gun of Mormon scholars, who also played fast and loose with his footnotes. See my review of Cheesman's book "These Early Americans." Click here, then scroll down to my review.These early Americans;: External evidences of the Book of Mormon,Of Joseph Smith's translation of the Egyptian papyri, Ferguson wrote:"Nibley's Era articles on the Book of Abraham aren't worth a tinker--first, because he is not impartial, being the commissioned and paid defender of the faith. Second, because he could not, he dared not, he did not, face the true issue: 'Could Joseph Smith translate Egyptian?'"Now a few criticisms of Ferguson's book, "One Shepherd, One Fold." The title of Ferguson's first chapter is amusing, "Voyage from Israel to Guatemala, 557 BC." Ferguson attempts to link the Maya to the Book of Mormon Hebrews," but if anything is this life is clear, it is that the native Maya living in Guatemala today could serve as models for the ancient kings depicted on the stela (upright stone monuments). In fact, side-by-side photos of modern Maya standing by the carvings are often found in reputable books on the Maya.Ferguson has several comparisons of Old World carvings with those of the New World, but these similarities are no longer seen as evidence of contact. Ferguson shows, for example, two Egyptians from 1100 BC and compares them to two Maya from 600 AD (page 111).Both sets of figures are wearing feline-skin clothes (from a leopard in Egypt and a jaguar in mesoamerica). What is this supposed to prove? Only that people in both areas used animal skins for clothing. And that by sifting through thousands of artifacts in both areas, you will find similarities (but be sure to ignore the overwhelming differences).The two pictures offered by Ferguson also show writing (Maya writing has now been translated and is not related to Egyptian or any other Old World language--see Michael Coe, "Breaking the Maya Code." Also, the art of the Egyptians is completely different than that of the Maya.As for such picture "evidence" that used to be in the Book of Mormon, it is refuted by the fact that the pictures were removed after some 20 years in the 1960s and 1970s. If it was valid and true, then why was it removed? Because it was bogus--including Milton R. Hunter's "horse" on the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itza. This Book of Mormon horse turned out to be a damaged portion of a mythical jaguar-serpent (the feather was its head).One page 228, Ferguson has Well's Jakeman's "Tree of Life Stone" from Izapa, Mexico. This claim was discredited by Mormons, themselves, a few years ago. First, Jakeman's drawing is highly inaccurate, and second, the so-called tree is actually a stylized crocodile (you can see its eye), and there are other crocodile trees (dragon trees) at Izapa that Jakeman deliberately ignored. Jakeman's claim has pretty much disappeared from Mormon writings on archaeology because it proved to be such an embarrassment to the church (Jakeman's methodology was roundly criticized).Your comments--good or bad--are appreciated. Thanks.See my other reviews of Mormon books.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksMeg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are brilliant in this fun time-travel movie. A man comes to the future and meets Ryan. His adventures in the big modern city are really funny and tell a lot about modern society.I don't want to tell too much. See the movie and then read a longer review. As a man who likes macho action movies, I enjoyed this "chick flick."

In Milton R. Hunter's "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon" (page 229), there is a photograph of the famous "Uncle Sam" carving on Stela 3 at La Venta, Mexico. Uncle Sam's chin beard, however, is airbrushed into the shoulder. This is clear in any other reproduction of the "Uncle Sam" figure.If this "Uncle Sam" figure is supposed to be a white man, he is indeed a strange Nephite because this half-naked man is wearing a human head as a pendant from his necklace.Such disreputable and illogical attempts to turn bearded Indians into white Nephites are as amusing as they are false. Remember that Montezuma--a Native American if there ever was one--had a beard.On page 6 of volume one, Hunter is pictured "pointing at likeness of the Chichen Itza horse and bearded man." It was "plainly visible to tourists and archaeologists. "There immediately before our eyes was new and valuable Book of Mormon evidence."Reality check: After much research, and not finding any reference to a carving of a horse at Chichen Itza, I discovered that the carving was the damaged portion of a backwards figure "S" jaguar serpent (a feather is the horse's head).A detailed rubbing of the stone can be seen in the "Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel," by Ralph Roys (University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, Oklahoma, 1967), plate 1.Further, nowhere in the North or South America did the civilizations have horses, cattle, sheep, steel weapons, swords, or chariots mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The Maya of real history were so ignorant of horses that when Cortes left his lame horse in the care of the Itza Maya, they fed it meat. The animal, of course, died from this strange diet.Terrified, the Maya erected a statue in the shape of a tapir, the closest approximation to a horse in their environment. They worshipped this "horse" as Tzimin Chac, after Tzimin, the tapir, whose profile roughly resembles a horse, no other animal save the deer even approximating the alien animal.Hunter's book is full of footnotes that do not check out and assumptions that will amuse those who have studied the history of ancient America.It is worth noting that for some twenty years, Milton R. Hunter's archaeological evidence was inserted into the Book of Mormon. The fact that it was dropped speaks volumes. But how did all these falsehoods get past the leaders of the LDS Church and put into a sacred volume?Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.See my other reviews of Mormon books.

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. I also want you to know that I don't believe the LDS Church is a cult; nor do I believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the Mormons I have known were the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Here is what one good Mormon said about one of Nibley's books."As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."Note: It is not the end of the world or the end of your religion to admit such things. In fact, by denying them and defending Nibley, Mormons invite ridicule. Why do that?Now for "Since Cumorah"--Like other books by Hugh Nibley, this book is brimming with faulty logic. On pages 6, Nibley says some Book of Mormon verses were changed to "avoid confusion" (a phrase used twice on one page). But on page 8, he says that the Book of Mormon's "meaning is always clear."Nibley says that the name "Benjamin" was changed to "Mosiah," and asks if this was really necessary. He does not say that the name was changed in two places and that Joseph Smith himself made the change.Nibley's language also appeals to emotion rather than reason. Describing the Book of Mormon, he says it is full of "inexhaustible invention combined with such unerring accuracy and consistency....the artist must not only balance a bowl of goldfish and three lighted candles on the end of a broomstick while fighting off a swarm of gadflies, but he must at the same time be carving an immortal piece of statuary from a lump of solid diorite."Wow! But he should have explained the 4,000 changes in the Book of Mormon (marked in an original edition of the Book of Mormon and published by Jerold and Sandra Tanner. See: "3,913 Changes in the Book of Mormon."Good scholarship requires that you cite the critic's books and respond to their arguments. Nibley doesn't do this.Nibley also asks how a "twenty-three-year-old backwoodsman in 1829" could make up a description of "an ancient coronation ceremony."First, Nibley was aware, of course, that Joseph Smith lived on Palmyra's Main Street as boy and then only two miles away on a farm. The Palmyra area was not in any sense the "backwoods." Rather, it was a settled farming region with bookstores and newspapers in every town. It had not been the frontier since the 1790s and the end of the Eastern Indian wars.The Grandin Book store was only two level miles from the Smith's front door, and some 200 wagons roamed the US selling books to farmers (the bookstore came to the farm). Produce was exchanged for books, and books could even be purchased with "clean rags."Second, the Bible in II Kings (11-12) and I Kings (1:43-46) describes session, crowning, anointing, proclaiming, sacrifice, and procession.The fundamental error of Nibley's writings concerns his citations of ancient sources at the same time avoiding the Bible (an ancient source available to Joseph Smith, a Bible reader).Sometimes Nibley's rhetoric gets ahead of his common sense. Of the words in the Book of Mormon, he asks, "...what American would dream of cooking up such combinations as "aa" or "kh"? Hello, how about Aaron? There are many words and names in the Bible with the "kh" sound--"molech," "meshach," and others that can easily be found. Also, in I Chronicles (11:37), there is "Naarai" and "Paari" (II Sam. 23:35).Again and again, Nibley ignores the Bible. In any honest discussion of gold plates, the gold plate in Exodus (28:36) should be mentioned. This gold plate had writing on it--"Holiness to the Lord." Brass plates are mentioned in the Book of Judith in the Apocrypha, and brass plates are mentioned in James Adair's "History of the American Indians" (1775). Also most books published in Joseph Smith's day had "copper plate engravings." References to writing on metal plates were common, rather than unknown as falsely argued by Hugh Nibley.Word games impress the uniformed, and Nibley was a master at them.In considering Nibley's lifework, Eric Hoffer's words are strangely prophetic. In his short classic, "The True Believer," Eric Hoffer observed:"The effectiveness of a doctrine should not be judged by its profundity, sublimity or the validity of the truths it embodies, but by how thoroughly it insulates the individual from his self and the world as it is.""The effectiveness of a doctrine does not come from its meaning but from its certitude.""It is obvious, therefore, that in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand. A doctrine that is understood is shorn of its strength." (quotations from page 76)Very powerful and convincing reasoning!Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.

So two writers--one time college friends (one successful, the other on the skids) meet accidentally, and the wealthy writer makes a proposal. The wealthy writer can't write because he is in the middle of a messy divorce, and because the other writer has a good novel he can't sell, the wealthy writer wants to put his name on it and give his old friend half the advance--1.2 million. The only way it will work, however, is for the wealthy man's wife to be dead, otherwise the greedy wife will get half.Okay, fine so far, but then the poor guy wants to meet the woman. They go on a date, and suddenly the man hits the woman in the stomach and beats her to death. Such an intimate act of violence just doesn't ring true, especially from a man not used to violence.So that's number one. Then the man tells his wife that he has killed the woman, and she thinks it's okay. Please.So that's number two. I won't give away the ending, but it's like the author got tired of writing and ended the story five chapters too soon--and with a cliche. Very disappointing.

This book is chock full of good advice (I spelled it wrong!: good advice/ advise me how to proceed)In spite of a small flaw, I recommend it. The flaw is in the print. It's brown rather than standard black. New writers may come away thinking such innovations are acceptable to publishers. Rule: If you don't want your manuscript put in the recycling bin, stick to standard fonts and black print (one-inch margins).As a desk reference, I have thumbed this book many times, and I would recommend it.

Repeat the following three times: The quack cures diseases people don't have! NAET is a scam. I went to an expert who was trained by the founder of this quackery. He had twenty-five years of experience. Did his vials and methods cure me? Of course, not. A lot of people are hypochondriacs, and self diagnose their disease. Then, of course, the quack produces a cure for something they did NOT actually have.The arm lowering technique is simply a parlor trick! I proved it one my friend, a big man who lifts weights. He laid on his back and raised his arm and held it stiff. I could NOT push it down. Then I had him try it again. This time I moved his arm slightly backward, then down. Magic? No, all I did was unlock his muscle. You can also do this with distraction by putting your finger between the person's eyes while they hold their arm stiff. You can't force their arm down, but if you turn your finger so the nail faces the skin, you can push the arm down.Repeat to yourself: The quack cures diseases that people don't have. If they actually have the disease, NAET doesn't work. There is also a huge psychological elements to things like allergies. They are aggravated by stress! Remove the stress, and you will see an improvement in many cases. Also, allergies come and go. Why did I develop allergies to tomatoes and onions (skin rashes around my eyes and mouth)? I ate these foods for decades with no irritation. Then I became sensitive to them. After treatments with NAET, I still have these allergies! I have hope that they might go away as mysteriously as they came, but NAET will have nothing to do with it.Like many others, I paid out good money for nothing. As they say, "A fool and his money are soon parted." So I played the fool, and I admit it. I've marked it off as an interesting experience, the same way I would at being called up on stage during a magic act.

It has been twenty years since I read this book, but it left a strong impression on me for its beautiful writing and images. In spite of what the one Amazon reviewer said, I would still recommend the book for its adventure and wonder, even if it is not an entirely true story. Just keep in mind that it might have a big dash of fiction. In a strange way, though, it makes the book even more interesting.The one Amazon reviewer said, "Anyone who is thinking about reading this book should know that VDP was a major BS artist. Very good at it too, was a friend of royalty and also Jung. If you can find it, read J.D.F. Jones "Storyteller: The Lives of Laurens Van Der Post". To his credit, he did oppose apartheid."Behind any book, there is often a very strange reality.

If you think this is a good book, then don't check out Nibley's sources or you will be sorely disappointed. I'll provide some abused sources found in just two pages (pages 212-213) of Nibley's book. In the following, Nibley is trying to justify Book of Mormon statements about the Jaredites having steel swords and glass windows in 2000 BC. Remember all of the following mistatements are found in a mere two pages of Nibley's book.1. Nibley uses an article by Wainwright about the "Coming of Iron." In speaking of an artifact from Egypt as being "steel," Nibley says "the tanslation is not absolutely certain..." Wainwright says "the translation is entirely guesswork." These descriptions are not equivalent. Also Wainwright says the use of iron before 1500 BC was extremely rare. On page 122, Nibley carelessly (and deliberately) uses the word "steel" in place of "iron" in his use of Wainwright's essay.2. Nibley quotes Vernadsky on the "History of Ancient Russia," but before his quotation about clans of iron workers, Nibley puts in his own bizarre theory that steel was "used in one place and forbidden in another." Nibley makes it sound like his source supports that screwball "forbidden" theory. Vernadsky (see page 43) does not.3. Nibley quotes from an article by D. B. Harden about ancient glass, but fails to mention that Harden says that glass in ancient times was as valuable gold and rubies. According to the article, colorless glass was not made until the 2nd century AD. Nibley ignored the sense of Harden's article in trying to get not just glass beads, but clear glass windows into 2000 BC.4. Nibley says steel "objects" were found at Darmesteter. His source says "one object" was found. Then Nibley speaks of the "correct chemical formula" for steel. This is misleading because an "analysis" is not a "formula." In other words, steel can be make accidentally by the addition of carbon to iron. Nibley twice uses "formula" in place of "analysis."5. Nibley says that "steel comes before iron in the four ages of Zarathustra." That is true, but these religious ages are listed by moral "value," not as indicating actual history. There are "gold" and "silver" ages, for example. Also Zarathustra dates from 600 BC, not 2000 BC. Nibley goes on to talk about "the Seljuk dynasty of Iran" without saying that he is talking about 1071 AD.6. Nibley mentions an ancient steel "bow" without noting that a "steel bow" is found in the Bible in II Samuel. Any honest discussion of the Book of Mormon steel bow should also mention II Samuel.On these two pages, Nibley gives the reader a snowstorm of facts and falsehoods that feel good, but prove nothing about Jaredite windows and steel swords.If you take all these references and sources, and there are many more in Nibley's book, you have a line of argument that only impresses the uninformed, or the reader who doesn't bother to actually check Nibley's sources.In a chapter about the Jaredites, for example, Nibley goes on about ancient steel and glass windows, but makes no attempt to justify the existence of the wooden (!) Jaredite submarines of 2000 BC (344 days in the ocean). Windows and steel weapons are a minor issue compared to the issue of submarines in 2000 BC, which Nibley completely ignores.Nibley's work is not scholarly, but simply emotional, religious propaganda. He says that critics believe that Joseph Smith was an "ignorant rustic who could hardly write his name" (page 128).This is simply false. Joseph Smith was an admitted Bible reader from age twelve. He also claimed to have read and translated the gold plates. His father had been a school teacher, and his brother Hyrum was on the Manchester school board. His mother was proud that all her children could read and write (though Joseph's handwriting was not the best). The Smiths even took the local newspaper.Nibley is, in fact, insulting the prophet by making him so stupid he could not compose the Book of Mormon. There has got to be a better defense of the Book of Mormon than that. The informed reader of Nibley's books will come to the conclusion that he "doth protest too much."I can't end without this quote from page 153 of Nibley's book. "The only weapons that have survived from prehistoric times are far more suited to their purpose than a modern rifle. The deadliest of all hunting weapons remains to this day the stone-headed (not steel-headed arrow)." Parenthesis by Nibley. Modern rifle and bow hunters raise your hand if you believe this! Nibley's weird theories should be an embarrassment to educated Mormons.Needless to say, a person who has a lot of footnotes in his or her book is not necessarily a scholar. As the modern historian Will Durant said: "The cleverest defenders of a faith are its greatest enemies because their subtleties engender doubt and stimulate the mind." No sentence could apply more perfectly to Hugh Nibley.Added example of a misrepresented source:In "Since Cumorah" (pages 62-63), Nibley writes about the ancient copper scroll containing the Book of Isaiah."The business of writing on such plates was hard and distasteful work....Writing on plates requires a cramped and abbreviated script, Moroni explains...and Allegro also notes the writing on copper plates actually produces a new kind of writing that is particularly difficult to read, characterized by mixing forms of letters, ignoring the proper spacing between words, "running-over from one line to the next in the middle of a word," and general neglect of the vowels."A greater deficiency lies in ourselves," Allegro concludes, "we simply do not possess a sufficiently comprehensive technical Hebrew vocabulary to deal with a text of this kind." This should have a sobering effect on those people who fondly suppose the if we could only discover some Nephite plates, the translation could be left to them: this sort of things needs an Urim and Thummin, indeed."Now, read the following and ask yourself if Nibley was honest with his source?His source is "The Treasure of the Copper Scroll," by John Marco Allegro (an expert).A. Allegro says that the scroll is in Hebrew and readable (though with some overlapping of words, pp. 27-28). In fact, Allegro provided a facsimile of the entire scroll. On one page is the scroll, and the opposite page is Hebrew writing with the English translation next to it. ALLEGRO DOES NOT SAY THAT WRITING ON PLATES PRODUCES A NEW KIND OF WRITING. In fact, he says, "A comparable fault in modern uneducated writing might be the mixing of small and capital letters, although there the diffence would not be so marked as, for instance, when our scribe writs a cursive `aleph" for the normal square-shaped. (letter).B. FACT: The copper scroll was translated by normal means by people who were experts in Hebrew.C. Allegro writes (following Nibley's selected quotes) that: "Happily in our scroll there are no true verbs, where alone vowelling might make a crucial difference to the interpretation. Whilst, therefore, we need not be unduly concerned about the lack of vowel signs in our text...Again, once aware of this failing (or device) on the part of our scribe, we can still recognize the word for what it is. A greater deficiency lies in ourselves....(Note, this sentence quoted by Nibley. He ignored what preceded it).D. Nibley has implied that an Urim and Thummin would be needed to translate the scroll, and he has totally distorted the sense of what Allegro was saying.It is also worth noting that if what Nibley says is true about a "cramped and abbreviated style of writing," then it is highly unlikely that any chiastic structures would survive a translation. (Mormons claim that "chiasmus"--parallel sentences are in the Book of Mormon as a result of such practices in ancient times. They carefully delete words, however, to produce these examples of chiasmus).Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksThis mystery for adults and teens really grabs you. A boy takes off on his bike to find his father, but his journey is very strange. The boy is in a secret compound because he has witnessed something.I don't want to give anything away, but this 220-page novel kept me reading.Buy on old paperback with the cover of the boy on his bike. In the background is a farmhouse and a man standing in a dirt lane--a wonderful illustration.If you like coming-of-age novels, read Robert McCammon's "Boy's Life." A super novel!

All the essays in this collection were thought-provoking, but one that I especially enjoyed was by Dan Vogel, "The Prophet Puzzle Revisited." Vogal notes that in one incident, Joseph Smith used his magic stone to see a treasure buried deep in the ground. He also saw the tail feather of a bird on the treasure chest, but when they dug into the earth, they found that the treasure had moved. The tail feather, however, was still there---an obvious case of salting.In reply to Mormon apologists, Vogal says, "Despite an attempt to minimize his early involvement in treasure searching, Smith was in reality an aggressive and ambitious leader among the competing treasure seers of Manchester, New York" (p. 51).Vogal was too kind in his use of "minimize." A more accurate description of these efforts would have been "lying for the Lord." See my review for the collection of essays by Mormon "scholars" edited by Donald Parry. Click below on "Echoes and Evidences for the Book of Mormon."John Sorenson's essay in that collection is especially enlightening. Speaking of Humboldt's "Researches," Sorenson says "the chance is vanishingly small that the learned German's esoteric work would have been accessible anywhere in America except at a handful of the best libraries on the Atlantic seaboard, to which Joseph had no access before the Book of Mormon was published" (1830).This confident, scholarly statement is completely false.First, Alexander Humboldt was not an "esoteric" writer; rather, he was one of the most celebrated scholars (and explorers) of his age. Further, I own the book that Mr. Sorenson is referring to, and it is not "esoteric" but written for the general reader. Humboldt visited Thomas Jefferson, and they went to Philadelphia to see the "ninth wonder of the world," the first reconstructed mammoth in about 1805.Second, Humboldt's "History of New Spain" was advertised on the front page of the Palmyra newspaper (Palmyra Register, October 6, 1818). Thus, there is every reason to believe that Humboldt's "Researches" was also advertized (the surviving issues are incomplete, especially for early dates).Sorensen was being intellectually dishonest in saying "Researches" was only in east-coast libraries. He knows better. BYU has the microfilm of the Palmyra newspapers.Every week, long lists of books appeared in the newspapers. The farmers were better informed about the classics than the people living in the area today.Third, the Smith's subscribed to the newspaper, and they only lived two level miles from the Grandin Book Store. Earlier they lived on Palmyra's Main Street. Joseph's father had been a school teacher, and Joseph's brother Hyrum was on the Manchester School Board. Hyrum was also a member of the Masonic Lodge of Palmyra. Thus, all kinds of books could have easily come to the Smiths by simple borrowing, and lastly, the Smiths taught Bible classes at their house, according to Bushman.This is not to mention that Joseph Smith's grandfather, Solomon Mack, wrote a religious autobiography when he was 78 (Joseph was ten). The book begins: "I, Solomon Mack" and talks about his parents. The Book of Mormon begins, "I, Nephi" and talks about Nephi's parents. Thus, at an early age, Joseph Smith had a novelists hardest question answered for him: "How do I begin my story?"The Smith's could have had any book they wanted. Seventy percent of the books sold in the US were published in England and the book trade (both ways) was great--$2.5 million dollars for around 1820 (Joseph was 15 then). Lastly, some 200 book wagons roamed the American countryside selling books--money not being a problem because they accepted produce and bookstores accepted "clean rags" in payment.Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon

My short review will lead you to a great novel! Read this book!I've read a lot of Richard Laymon's books, and this is one of his best--a real grabber. How can you not want to find out what's going to happen when a librarian finds a note leading her to a book with $50 in it. The next night she finds another book with a $100 in it, then $200 and so on.The librarian is told that she has to go to certain places at night to find the next clue. Some are really creepy, including a room in a run-down building with a coffin in it.I kept reading through one adventure after another. I don't like to give too much away on novels, so please just go with the main idea. Your trust will be well rewarded. A super novel.

Note: Some immature Mormon has been slamming my reviews because I wrote some negative reviews of books attempting to defend the Book of Mormon.So your "helpful" votes are greatly appreciated. A short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a fascinating book. In this review, I have just noted the general theme. Thanks"Religion and the Decline of Magic" is full of insights that help us understand the appeal of magic and our intellectual heritage. Why isn't magic as popular today as religion? What happened?In his massive study, Keith Thomas says of the occult beliefs in astrology, witchcraft, magical healing, divination, ancient prophecies, ghosts, and fairies that:"In offering an explanation for misfortune, and a means of redress at times of adversity, they seemed to be discharging a role very close to that of the established Church and its rivals. Sometimes they were parasitic upon Christian teaching; sometimes they were in sharp rivalry to it."I won't attempt a detailed review, but this book is highly recommended as background for the emergence of Mormonism (not the subject of Thomas' book, however). But Joseph Smith's claims clearly had a genealogy going back to 16th century Europe.Paul Slack in "History Today" (1981) said: "Few historians have that ability to surprise and convince with unfailing regularity, to say something absolutely original and make it seem self-evident. That is why "Religion and the Decline of Magic" remains a commanding work, one of the three or four outstanding pieces of historical writing to have appeared in the last thirty years."For a detailed review, read the other reviewer's excellent posting. I would only add that Thomas' book should have been given five stars. What a praiseworthy work of scholarship!

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.So your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. Thanks, and note that ashort review can be a good review if it prompts a person to read a good novel.This was one of the most enjoyable stories I ever read. Set in modern times, there is an accident at a research facility, and one man becomes invisible.The adventure starts there. It's too bad this author never wrote any other books, but this novel is a classic and a fun read. The man even finds a woman to love him.The many dangers of being invisible were fascinating--like being accidentally hit by people or cars. And, of course, the government wouldn't let him live his life. They wanted to use him (make him a prisoner). He was too valuable. A great fantasy about a man being tracked down by the government.I don't want to say too much and ruin the story, so just go it. Fantastic.Also, don't miss the original "Invisible Man," by H.G. Wells.

ThanksI loved this novel about a strange carnival that comes to a small mid-western town. The hero is a boy who gets caught up in a mystery.Buy the old paperback with the cover showing a circus tent and wagon in the Kansas countryside. Not to be missed--the book cover and the novel.It's too bad Tom Reamy didn't live long enough to write another novel. One reviewer said, "Not since Bradbury has a fantasy author so captured the dark heart of midwestern America." Harlan Ellison, another critic, asked, "How good is this book? It is breathtakingly good."Two other great coming-of-age novels are "Summer of Night," by Dan Simmons, and "Boy's Life," by Robert McCammon. If you have missed these novels, you are in for a treat.

I love Bill Pronzini. While not as good as "Blue Lonesome," I really enjoyed this novel about a prostitution ring and game-cock fighting bad guys. Others can go into more detail, but I'll mention a wonderful Italian phrase used by the old Italian in the story: "La bellezza delle bellezze, "The beauty of beauties. Ah, sweet! Prozini's occasional use of an Italian phrase really set the mood for this San Francisco story about an old Italian's search for a missing niece.I would agree with the other reviewer to start with another of Prozini's books.

If you haven't read this all-time best adventure story, do so. You're in for a treat (it beats the movie versions hands down). During World War II, a plane crashes in the North African desert, and the survivors reconstruct it to fly again. That's enough to tell. Read a longer review after you read the book.I hope you find the following suggestions useful. All great African adventures:Also read "Cry Wolf," by Wilbur Smith--another great African story (set in Ethiopia in the 1930s):Cry WolfAnd don't miss "The Sands of Kalahari" (a plane crashes in the Kalahari desert):The Sands of Kalahari"The Sapphire Sea" (a modern adventure in Zanzibar), by Ben Robinson.The Sapphire Sea

Joe Lansdale rules East Texas and knows how to spin a yarn. I really got caught up in the story about an uneducated woman with flaming red hair who becomes the constable of a sawmill town. I would have changed the ending a bit, but the story really rocked for me. When white powers that be try to cheat a black man out of his land (there's oil on it), the bodies start to pile up.What makes for a super novel? Do you care about the characters? Yes, I did.I've loved all of the novels by Lansdale that I have read, and I would highly recommend this one.Try: Lansdale's "The Bottoms,"The Bottoms (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Original)Also good is "A Fine Dark Line":A Fine Dark LineAnd, "The Drive In":Joe R.

I like reincarnation stories and the like, but after trying to get through Audrey Rose twice, I gave up. I think the thing that bothered me was the author's attempt to convince the reader that reincarnation is true--he cites various religious books from around the world.In my opinion, a fiction writer should lead the reader toward a suspension of disbelief, not beat him over the head with facts and arguments. Little clues should add up that allow the reader to get lost in the story.I loved the "Exorcist" and "RoseMary's Baby," but Audrey Rose just did not work for me.

Of Joseph Smith's translation of the Egyptian papyri, Ferguson wrote the following in the late 1960s when the papyri were located:"Nibley's Era articles on the Book of Abraham aren't worth a tinker--first, because he is not impartial, being the commissioned and paid defender of the faith. Second, because he could not, he dared not, he did not, face the true issue: 'Could Joseph Smith translate Egyptian?'"Here are a few criticisms of Ferguson's "One Shepherd, One Fold," written before he lost his faith. The title of Ferguson's first chapter is amusing, "Voyage from Israel to Guatemala, 557 BC." Ferguson attempts to link the Maya to the Book of Mormon Hebrews," but if anything is this life is clear, it is that the native Maya living in Guatemala today could serve as models for the ancient kings depicted on the stela (upright stone monuments). In fact, side-by-side photos of modern Maya standing by the carvings are often found in reputable books on the Maya.Go to Guatemala and look at your waiter. He will often look like the figures seen in archaeology books. It is most disgraceful for any writer on the subject not to point this out. Mormon writers are apparently blind to this reality.Ferguson has several comparisons of Old World carvings with those of the New World, but these similarities are no longer seen as evidence of contact. Ferguson shows, for example, two Egyptians from 1100 BC and compares them to two Maya from 600 AD (page 111).Both sets of figures are wearing feline-skin clothes (from a leopard in Egypt and a jaguar in mesoamerica). What is this supposed to prove? Only that people in both areas used animal skins for clothing. And that by sifting through thousands of artifacts in both areas, you will find similarities (but be sure to ignore the overwhelming differences).The two pictures offered by Ferguson also show writing (Maya writing has now been translated and is not related to Egyptian or any other Old World language--see Michael Coe, "Breaking the Maya Code." Also, the art of the Egyptians is completely different than that of the Maya.As for such picture "evidence" that used to be in the Book of Mormon, it is refuted by the fact that the pictures were removed after some 20 years in the 1960s and 1970s. If it was valid and true, then why was it removed? Because it was bogus--including Milton R. Hunter's "horse" on the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itza. This Book of Mormon horse turned out to be a damaged portion of a mythical jaguar-serpent (the feather was its head).One page 228, Ferguson has Well's Jakeman's "Tree of Life Stone" from Izapa, Mexico. This claim was discredited by Mormons, themselves, a few years ago. First, Jakeman's drawing is highly inaccurate, and second, the so-called tree is actually a stylized crocodile (you can see its eye), and there are other crocodile trees (dragon trees) at Izapa that Jakeman deliberately ignored. Jakeman's claim has pretty much disappeared from Mormon writings on archaeology because it proved to be such an embarrassment to the church (Jakeman's methodology was roundly criticized--see "Journal of Book of Mormon Studies," vol. 8, no. 1, 1999, the whole issue devoted to distancing Mormons from Jakeman's claim).In short, time has not been kind to the claims of Jakeman, Ferguson, Cheesman, Hunter and other writers on the subject of "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon."On page 263, Ferguson wrote: "The important thing now is to continue the digging at an accelerated pace in order to find more inscriptions dating to Book-of-Mormon times. Eventually we should find deciperable inscriptions in modified (reformed) Egyptian, in a modified or pure Hebrew or in cuneiform, referring to some unique person, place or event in the Book of Mormon" (this was written in 1958--fifty years ago), and yes the inscriptions have now been decipered, but, alas, they talk about "18 rabbit" and other pagan kings in a pagan and blood-letting religion).Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.See my other reviews of Mormon books. For more details of Ferguson's lost faith, see my review of his "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon."

Stan Larson does a masterful job telling the fascinating story of Thomas Stewart Ferguson.When the "Book of Abraham" papyri translated by Joseph Smith came to light in the 1960s, Thomas Stewart Ferguson, the great defender of the Book of Mormon, sent copies of the papyri to four experts in ancient Egyptian writing. He did not tell them he was a Mormon or that the papyri had anything to do with Mormonism. Here is what Ferguson concluded:"Since four scholars, who have established that they can read Egyptian, say that the manuscripts deal with neither Abraham nor Joseph--and since the four reputable men tell us exactly what the manuscripts do say--I must conclude that Joseph Smith had not the remotest skill in things Egyptian--hieroglyphics."Before he lost his faith, Ferguson wrote "One Fold and One Shepherd"(Books of California, San Francisco, 1958), a display of bogus or equivocal archaeological "evidence" for the Book of Mormon. Ferguson, who died a non-believer, would never know that his earlier book would be resurrected in a most disreputable way.Four years after Ferguson died, an edited edition of his book was published under the title "The Messiah in Ancient America" (Book of Mormon Research Foundation, Provo, Utah 1987).When Dr. Paul R. Cheesman of BYU wrote the forward, he had no shame and did not even mention Ferguson's loss of faith. Dr. Cheesman said, "(This) book should reinstate Thomas Stuart Ferguson as a source of enrichment in the fields of study concerning Mesoamerica and the Book of Mormon."The reader unfamiliar with Ferguson's loss of faith would never know the significance of the word "reinstate." Those who did could only shake their heads in dismay, wondering why reinstatement was necessary if Ferguson died a believer?See my review of Cheesman's "These Early Americans" for more examples of Cheesman's dishonorable "scholarship."

Note: Mormons have be slamming my reviews, so I would appreciate your "helpful" vote. Obviously they don't want you to read what former Mormons are saying.I have repeatedly asked and never found an answer to the following question: If the LDS Church is the only true church, how is it that good people who totally believed in it would ever leave it (and continue to live good lives)?Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksI thought all the interviews were fascinating. The interview with Paul Rolly really hit the nail on the head:Question: "Have you ever considered asking for excommunication?"Answer: "No. But if anybody ever wanted to, they could do that. I wouldn't go play their game. I mean, I wouldn't go to a bishop. I wouldn't do any of that stuff. Plus, I don't want to do anything to hurt my kids, either."Rolly's answer illuminates the dark side of Mormonism--fear.See my one-star reviews of books by Mormon authors who attempt to defend the Book of Mormon through specious scholarship. See my reviews of Hugh Nibley's books, for example, and "Echoes and Evidences for the Book of Mormon."Echoes and Evidences of the Book of MormonAnother book by former Mormons that I highly recommend is "American Apocrypha," edited by Dan Vogel and Brent Lee Metcalfe. In that book,Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....""Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I came to Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence."Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text."To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.""The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties."American Apocrypha: Essays on the Book of Mormons (Essays on Mormonism Series)Your comments--positive or negative--are greatly appreciated.

Nibley was a good man with a talent for picking out phrases from his sources and using them to his polemical advantage. It didn't matter that he misrepresented his sources. The only thing that mattered was that the reader went away with a stronger faith in the Book of Mormon. This old story is found often in the pages of history--in all religions. If you tell people what they want to hear, you need not worry too much about your sources. They won't be checked. The producer of this type of writing is often bursting at the seams with facts, falsehoods, and misunderstandings, so much so that they actually seduce themselves into believing that they have accomplished something important. Another way to put it is "the end justifies the means."Now for specific failings of Nibley's scholarship. These are all facts the Nibley knew but ignored.Modern Mormon scholars have conceded as true what the critics have been saying about Joseph Smith. One BYU historian (Anderson) called Joseph Smith "the village magician." In other words, Joseph Smith was heavily involved in magic--at one point sacrificing a black dog. Bushman concedes that Joseph Smith married women who were still married to their husbands. It was Nibley who was lying about Joseph Smith. Surely, Nibley had been to Palmyra and seen that the Smith farm is exactly two level miles from the Grandin Bookstore. Alvin Smith was buried within a hundred yards of the bookstore. Hiram Smith was on the Manchester school board, Mr. and Mrs. Smith taught school in their home.Third cousin Oliver Cowdery lived in the ten-person house, and Oliver was a schoolteacher. Joseph Smith's father had been a schoolteacher in Vermont. Hiram was a member of the Masonic Lodge of Palmyra. Joseph was on the juvenile debate team. When Alvin died, Joseph's mother said "a vast concourse" of people attended the funeral. Joseph often spent a couple hours in the woods reading the Bible. YET! YET, GET THIS! Nibley called Joseph Smith an "illiterate" and a "backwoodsman." Who, then, is telling tales and sounding cymbals. Anyone who knows the above facts about Joseph Smith will have to agree that it was Nibley, not the critics.Nibley's shameful pamphlet "No Ma'am, That's Not History" is another example of dishonorable scholarship. This supposed review of Brodie's "No Man Knows My History" never responded to Brodie's claim that Joseph Smith got the idea of Kolob from Thomas's Dick's "Philosophy of a Future State" (Heaven), even though (from memory) Nibley does talk about Thomas Dick. Dick says something to the effect that at the "center of the universe" is a "grand central body," the "throne of God." Dick goes on and on about heavenly "intelligences," "celestial intelligences," and so forth. In a most unethical spin, Nibley translates these Mormon terms into "intelligent progressive beings," carefully avoiding the words that Dick used.Dick also went on about eternal progression and "spirits who kept their first estate" (quoting the Bible). Nibley played Mormons for uneducated fools that would never check his sources. Nibley could barely bring himself to even cite Brodie's book (it's in a footnote ONCE in some forty pages!) Also, Nibley could barely bring himself to use Bodie's name, often referring to her as "the lady."She used "a court record that doesn't even exist," Nibley says, but nowadays the record of Joseph Smith's trial for "money digging" using a magic stone is accepted by most, if not all, LDS historians. Beware: Nibley lied to promote the Gospel, and apparently felt that was okay because of the end result trumped the means.Brother Nibley may have lived an honorable life, but in his scholarship, he sold his soul to the philosophy of "the end justifies the means." His scholarly goal--if it can be referred to as "scholarly"--was to give educated Mormons who don't have the time to check his sources something to point to as proof that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document.In short, his sources are distorted for that goal. The references that follow can be verified if you are willing to go to the effort to determine if what I am saying is true. Nibley's poor scholarship is NOT a matter of opinion. It is a matter black and white that can be verified.The following is from my review of "World of the Jaredites."If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. I also want you to know that I don't believe the LDS Church is a cult; nor do I believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the Mormons I have known were the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Here is what one good Mormon said about one of Nibley's books."As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."Note: It is not the end of the world or the end of your religion to admit such things. In fact, by denying them and defending Nibley, Mormons invite ridicule. Why do that?Now for specifics. If you think this is a good book, then don't check out Nibley's sources or you will be sorely disappointed. I'll provide some abused sources found in just two pages (pages 212-213) of Nibley's book. In the following, Nibley is trying to justify Book of Mormon statements about the Jaredites having steel swords and glass windows in 2000 BC. Remember all of the following mistatements are found in a mere two pages of Nibley's book.1. Nibley uses an article by Wainwright about the "Coming of Iron." In speaking of an artifact from Egypt as being "steel," Nibley says "the translation is not absolutely certain..." Wainwright says "the translation is entirely guesswork." These descriptions are not equivalent. Also Wainwright says the use of iron before 1500 BC was extremely rare. On page 122, Nibley carelessly (and deliberately) uses the word "steel" in place of "iron" in his use of Wainwright's essay.2. Nibley quotes Vernadsky on the "History of Ancient Russia," but before his quotation about clans of iron workers, Nibley puts in his own bizarre theory that steel was "used in one place and forbidden in another." Nibley makes it sound like his source supports that screwball "forbidden" theory. Vernadsky (see page 43) does not.3. Nibley quotes from an article by D. B. Harden about ancient glass, but fails to mention that Harden says that glass in ancient times was as valuable gold and rubies. According to the article, colorless glass was not made until the 2nd century AD. Nibley ignored the sense of Harden's article in trying to get not just glass beads, but clear glass windows into 2000 BC.4. Nibley says steel "objects" were found at Darmesteter. His source says "one object" was found. Then Nibley speaks of the "correct chemical formula" for steel. This is misleading because an "analysis" is not a "formula." In other words, steel can be make accidentally by the addition of carbon to iron. Nibley twice uses "formula" in place of "analysis."5. Nibley says that "steel comes before iron in the four ages of Zarathustra." That is true, but these religious ages are listed by moral "value," not as indicating actual history. There are "gold" and "silver" ages, for example. Also Zarathustra dates from 600 BC, not 2000 BC. Nibley goes on to talk about "the Seljuk dynasty of Iran" without saying that he is talking about 1071 AD.6. Nibley mentions an ancient steel "bow" without noting that a "steel bow" is found in the Bible in II Samuel. Any honest discussion of the Book of Mormon steel bow should also mention II Samuel.On these two pages, Nibley gives the reader a snowstorm of facts and falsehoods that feel good, but prove nothing about Jaredite windows and steel swords.If you take all these references and sources, and there are many more in Nibley's book, you have a line of argument that only impresses the uninformed, or the reader who doesn't bother to actually check Nibley's sources.In a chapter about the Jaredites, for example, Nibley goes on about ancient steel and glass windows, but makes no attempt to justify the existence of the wooden (!) Jaredite submarines of 2000 BC (344 days in the ocean). Windows and steel weapons are a minor issue compared to the issue of submarines in 2000 BC, which Nibley completely ignores.Nibley's work is not scholarly, but simply emotional, religious propaganda. He says that critics believe that Joseph Smith was an "ignorant rustic who could hardly write his name" (page 128).This is simply false. Joseph Smith was an admitted Bible reader from age twelve. He also claimed to have read and translated the gold plates. His father had been a school teacher, and his brother Hyrum was on the Manchester school board. His mother was proud that all her children could read and write (though Joseph's handwriting was not the best). The Smiths even took the local newspaper.Nibley is, in fact, insulting the prophet by making him so stupid he could not compose the Book of Mormon. There has got to be a better defense of the Book of Mormon than that. The informed reader of Nibley's books will come to the conclusion that he "doth protest too much."I can't end without this quote from page 153 of Nibley's book. "The only weapons that have survived from prehistoric times are far more suited to their purpose than a modern rifle. The deadliest of all hunting weapons remains to this day the stone-headed (not steel-headed arrow)." Parenthesis by Nibley. Modern rifle and bow hunters raise your hand if you believe this! Nibley's weird theories should be an embarrassment to educated Mormons.Needless to say, a person who has a lot of footnotes in his or her book is not necessarily a scholar. As the modern historian Will Durant said: "The cleverest defenders of a faith are its greatest enemies because their subtleties engender doubt and stimulate the mind." No sentence could apply more perfectly to Hugh Nibley.Added example of a misrepresented source:In "Since Cumorah" (pages 62-63), Nibley writes about the ancient copper scroll containing the Book of Isaiah."The business of writing on such plates was hard and distasteful work....Writing on plates requires a cramped and abbreviated script, Moroni explains...and Allegro also notes the writing on copper plates actually produces a new kind of writing that is particularly difficult to read, characterized by mixing forms of letters, ignoring the proper spacing between words, "running-over from one line to the next in the middle of a word," and general neglect of the vowels."A greater deficiency lies in ourselves," Allegro concludes, "we simply do not possess a sufficiently comprehensive technical Hebrew vocabulary to deal with a text of this kind." This should have a sobering effect on those people who fondly suppose the if we could only discover some Nephite plates, the translation could be left to them: this sort of things needs an Urim and Thummin, indeed."Now, read the following and ask yourself if Nibley was honest with his source?His source is "The Treasure of the Copper Scroll," by John Marco Allegro (an expert).A. Allegro says that the scroll is in Hebrew and readable (though with some overlapping of words, pp. 27-28). In fact, Allegro provided a facsimile of the entire scroll. On one page is the scroll, and the opposite page is Hebrew writing with the English translation next to it. ALLEGRO DOES NOT SAY THAT WRITING ON PLATES PRODUCES A NEW KIND OF WRITING. In fact, he says, "A comparable fault in modern uneducated writing might be the mixing of small and capital letters, although there the difference would not be so marked as, for instance, when our scribe writs a cursive `aleph" for the normal square-shaped. (letter).B. FACT: The copper scroll was translated by normal means by people who were experts in Hebrew.C. Allegro writes (following Nibley's selected quotes) that: "Happily in our scroll there are no true verbs, where alone vowelling might make a crucial difference to the interpretation. Whilst, therefore, we need not be unduly concerned about the lack of vowel signs in our text...Again, once aware of this failing (or device) on the part of our scribe, we can still recognize the word for what it is. A greater deficiency lies in ourselves....(Note, this sentence quoted by Nibley. He ignored what preceded it).D. Nibley has implied that an Urim and Thummin would be needed to translate the scroll, and he has totally distorted the sense of what Allegro was saying.It is also worth noting that if what Nibley says is true about a "cramped and abbreviated style of writing," then it is highly unlikely that any chiastic structures would survive a translation. (Mormon writers claim that "chiasmus"--parallel sentences are in the Book of Mormon as a result of such practices in ancient times. They carefully delete words, however, to produce these examples of chiasmus).Please check my reviews of other books by Hugh Nibley. Thanks.An Approach to the Book of Mormon:An Approach to the Book of Mormon (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley)Since Cumorah: Since Cumorah (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley)Since Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern world

This wonderful novel takes place in a city, but on the fringes of that urban environment live people who are part animal and can change forms. Based on Native American mythology, De Lint has constructed a wonderful world of colorful characters (one man lives in an old bus at a dump, another drives an armor-plated taxi for gangsters).I got lost in this remarkable fantasy--highly recommended.Also read "The Trader" (a man wakes up in another man's body--a page turner), by De Lint.

Oh, wellYour "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book.A reviewer at the "Boston Globe" said it all when he asked: "How can I persuade every intelligent person to read this important and elegant book?"There are so many great lines and passages in this book that even now it is timely. I hope the following tip makes your reading of my review worthwhile.

They find a way to go inside and enter a strange artificial world. I really enjoyed this novel about an encounter with a vanished civilization.If you like the concept of a mini artificial-world, you will also love Arthur C.

If you vote "not helpful" on this particular review, please tell me why. That's only fair because it is a subject of such importance to America. If you think Moore exaggerated, then please read my own horror stories below.No one should oppose National Health Insurance without first seeing Michael Moore's unrelenting line of horror stories about American health care--a mere selection of 25,000 stories.But I will not repeat Moore's horror stories. I'll give you some of my own. A doctor tried to talk me into a hernia operation. Coincidentally, I saw another doctor a week later. He checked me and said that I didn't have a hernia and that I should never go back to that doctor. Hello, in other words, I was going to pay for that doctor's swimming pool!In the US the incentive for doctors is to perform more and more operations, not to keep people well (as in other countries).My nephew went to see a find doctor at a major medical center, but the doctor refused to diagnose or treat my nephew. Actually, he was doing my nephew a favor because if he had tested him or treated him, he would not have been able to get long-term care insurance. He went out and got the insurance, and had to wait a year to go back to see the doctor! The waiting period!I had to wait 90 days to get coverage with a new job. In the meantime, I was coughing all over my students.Let us all agree to this American creed: No American should lose their home or life savings simply because they get sick. How can anyone disagree with that?The American middle class had better wake up. Regardless of whether you have health insurance or not, you are only one or two diseases away from loosing our life savings and homes. National health insurance is the only answer, taking the best from the other countries that have it (and have a longer life expectancies--we rank 42).Those who oppose national health insurance should do the honorable thing and turn down Medicare as a matter of principle. American cancer survival rates are higher, but note the following:In response to an email that I sent, the Nation Cancer Institute said that "55.8 percent of all cancer cases are diagnosed in people 65 years and older." So Medicare has a big input in those survival rates. Probably even a greater impact in hip replacements. So the argument that government health insurance results in poor quality care is bogus.Now quick, would you want to go to the Mayo Clinic, John Hopkins Medical Center, or a major VA hospital? ANSWER: THE VA PERFORMS BETTING IN ALMOST ALL AREAS. My two cousins love it.Don't believe the lies told about Canada. Sara Robinson, who has duel Canadian-American citizenship, refuted common myths told about Canadian health care in "Ten Myths about the Canadian Health Care System" (see internet).One of those great myths is that Canada's health-care system is "socialized medicine." False: In socialized medical systems, the doctors work directly for the state. In Canada (and many other countries with universal care), doctors run their own private practices, just like they do in the US. The only difference is that every doctor deals with one insurer, instead of 150.The percentage of Canadians who'd consider giving up their beloved system consistently languishes in the single digits. A few years ago, a TV show asked Canadians to name the Greatest Canadian in history; and in a broad national consensus, they gave the honor to Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier who is considered the father of the country's health care system.It is both true and false that there are longer waits. It all depends where you live. For the vast majority of Canadians, it is not true, but true for a few.It is false that Canadians don't get to choose theirs own doctor.Somebody, somewhere, is getting paid a lot of money to make this kind of stuff up. A bogus falsehood.Canadian drugs are not the same. This is more preposterous bogosity.They are exactly the same drugs, made by the same pharmaceutical companies, often in the same factories. The Canadian drug distribution system, however, has much tighter oversight; and pharmacies and pharmacists are more closely regulated. If there is a difference in Canadian drugs at all, they're actually likely to be safer.It is false that publicly-funded programs will inevitably lead to rationed health care, particularly for the elderly. Sara Robinson calls this myth "False and bogglingly so." "The papers would have a field day if there was the barest hint that this might be true."Basic morality 101: No person should loose their home or life savings because they are sick.One of my readers is from Germany, and she worked at a private clinic in England. Their customers were wealthy Arabs, who could have come to the USA, but chose England. Why would they choose a so-called "socialist country"? Because England does not have socialized medicine--there are private hospitals, private doctors, and private insurance.You cannot argue with life spans in countries with universal coverage. Here they are (overall, male and female--females live longer). I am looking only at major countries. There is something wrong when other capitalist countries are better off than our wealthy country.Major Countries by Lifespan (all have universal health care). Except for communist Cuba, all these countries are ranked in the world's top 15 capitalistic economies.Japan: 82.6Switzerland: 81.7 (at the top of the economic competitive list)Australia: 81.2Spain: 80.9 (booming capitalist economy and universal coverage)Sweden: 80.9 (leader in green energy)Israel: 80.7 (major private investor in US economy)France (metropolitan): 80.7 (the doctors make house calls)Canada: 80.7Italy: 80.5New Zealand: 80.2Norway: 80.2United Kingdom: 79.4 (they must be doing something right. About tenth in world economic competitiveness)Germany: 79.4Ireland: 78.9 (booming private economy with universal coverage)Cuba: 78.3 (Lacking the wealth to buy our medical marvels, Cuba still beats the US!)United States: 78.2 (Shame on us.)

Sequels seldom match the orginal book, but this story kept me reading. Actually, it is much more than a sequel: it's a novel in its own right, and you really don't have to read "Summer of Night" to enjoy it.But if you haven't read "Summer of Night," I highly recommend that you do. Then read a "Winter Haunting."In the original novel some boys helped save their town from evil forces. Centered around an abandoned school and the cemetery, this was a ten-star coming-of-age novel. In the sequel, the hero (now a man) returns to the town. Much has changed for the worse (the town has declined), and he finds that not all the evil characters he fought as a boy were destroyed.The man meets a strange woman, but I'll stop here. I don't want to ruin the story. I'll just say that it's a great read.

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as soon as they are posted. Oh, well.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated, and please remember that a short review can be a good review if it leads you to a great novel.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Anyone who has roamed the deserts and canyons of southern Utah will get lost in this book. And even if you are only an armchair adventurer, you'll love the descriptions of the scenery.The story takes place in modern times, and it begins with the discovery of a map. The map shows the route to a Tyrannosaur (but not in the way you might think).I don't like giving things away, so I'll just say it has a fascinating premise and is a great adventure novel set in modern times.

The premise of the story is compelling, and the writing super. I felt, however, that the novel was too dark--too realistic about what might happen in that situation (I don't want to give away the ending).I loved "Blood Meridian," one of the most powerful novels I ever read, and I also loved "All the Pretty Horses."I hesitate to give "No Country for Old Men" anything but five stars, but I thought several times in reading this fascinating story that McCarthy is consumed with a negative picture of the future. Too darkly realistic.Hermann Hess saw the decline of the West in the record players of the 1920s. Look what is happening to our music--the sounds of the great orchestras are being replaced by this screechy so-called "music." Hess could not envision technological perfection in those old Victrolas, and indeed with the rise of Hitler, it did look like the free West was on its decline. I sense this erroneous assumption in McCarthy's novel.I know this is fiction, but that's the thought came to me, nevertheless. How can I say this...if all the books about murders and serial killers represented reality, there would be ten times as much crime as there is. Then, McCarthy's dark vision of the present and future would be more justified.Emerson said of life, "The too much contemplation of these limits induces meanness. They who talk much of destiny, their birth-star, etc., are in a lower dangersous plane, and invite the evils they fear."

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated.Nineteenth-century art has a wonderful depth to it, and this book has almost a hundred full-color pictures and some 400 in black and white. The quality of the book is fantastic. This is a must for anyone interested the 19th century painting.I love pictures that tell a story. Look at the mystery and story on the cover of this book. It's full of other wonderful paintings ane well-worth the price.If you like black-and-white engravings from the 19th century, get "A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought," by David Allen Williams. This book is full of rare 19th century engravings that match its quotations from the Humanist perspective--a beautiful art book that has been overlooked because of it's title.Click here to see the images:A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought

I enjoyed looking through this "dictionary," but I hope it is revised with separate sections on the Olmec, Maya, and Aztecs (the alphabetical format could be retained). As a "dictionary," it also should have been much longer (four or five hundred pages instead of two hundred).Nevertheless, the general reader interested in Mesoamerica will enjoy this book. I have a large collection of books on Mesoamerica, and I found several illustrations that I have not seen before. There is a fascinating picture of a jaguar skeleton with a jade ball in its mouth (Aztec).The illustration of a Maya dancer is also fascinating. "In a state of shamanic transformation, a May lord would take on an animal self or 'uay,' most commonly the jaguar."Another shows a "Maya figure wearing a War Serpent headdress." The fangs of the serpent rise above the figure's head.Still another shows "The monkey scribal gods painting a codex." The monkey-headed men are dressed like Maya scribes.I would recommend buying a used copy of this book.

I read this novel when in first came out in 1974, and I just read it again. My, how times have changed. The author refers to a woman's "colored maid," and the blacks Peter Proud meets when he visits an old neighborhood are all angry and violent. Then there is a remark about gays that would not be made today. "Anyone in LA who doesn't play tennis is a queer." Something like that. There is also the use of "gay" as "happy." Something like, "She was a fun-loving, gay person." Wow!Also, I wished the author had not described Proud's girlfriend as having "violet eyes." Please, keep to more normal colors, and don't go on and on about her body. One sentence would suffice. "She had a sensuous body."Still, I enjoyed the mystery of Peter Proud trying to find out who he was in a previous life, and I would recommend the novel.

When I first read the 1800 English translation, I could not put it down. Here are the first lines--a real grabbers! "In the year 1514, I left Castile (Spain) in company with Pedro Arias de Avila, who was then appointed governor of Tierra Firma (east Panama)...but afterwards suspicious that his son-in-law had an intention of revolting, he caused him to be beheaded."Bernal's description of the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan is amazing: "To many of us it appeared doubtful whether we were asleep of awake; nor is the manner in which I express myself to be wondered at, for it must be considered, that never yet did man see, hear or dream of anything equal to the spectacle which appeared to our eyes on this day."And how about this magnificent line: "And now, let who can, tell me, where are men in this world to be found, except ourselves, who would have hazarded such an attempt."And here is the horrific vision the Spaniards beheld when they climbed to the top of the great Aztec temple-pyramid. Remember that nearby, and looming up like a nightmare, was the stupendous "tzompantli," or skull rack. By careful Spanish count, it contained the grinning remains of 136,000 human beings."In this place they had a drum of most enormous size, the head of which was made of the skins of large serpents: this instrument when struck resounded with a noise that could be heard to the distance of two leagues, and so doleful that it deserved to be named the music of the infernal regions; and with their horrible sounding horns and trumpets, their great knives for sacrifice, their human victims, and their blood besprinkled altars, I devoted them, and all their wickedness to God's vengeance, and thought that the time would never arrive, that I should escape from this scene of human butchery, horrible smells, and more detestable sights."The Conquest takes on a different color when seen through the eyes of the Spanish. Yes, they were greedy and cruel, but the scale of human sacrifice practiced by the Aztecs was beyond imagination. It is said that some twenty thousand people were sacrificed for the dedication of the Temple of the Sun. The Aztec priests worked for hours on end cutting out human hearts. They worked until they collapsed from exhaustion.Bernal's history is also interesting for another entirely different reason. Joseph Smith (born 1805), the Mormon prophet, came of age during the period of English translations of Spanish histories (Bernal's in 1800 in London, and 1803 in the US, and Clevigero's "History of Mexico" in 1806 in Virginia and 1817 in Philadelphia).Therefore, the golden splendor of the Spanish conquests of Mexico and Peru was fresh on everyone's mind, especially because the Spanish colony of Florida had become an American state (1821).Thus, any notion that Americans were unaware of the great civilizations of ancient America is without foundation in real history. Ancient civilizations in America were so on the mind of people that in 1816, Solomon Spaulding wrote a history about a white and dark race in ancient America. His novel, "Manuscript Found," had the white race of mound builders destroyed by a darker-skin race.Read my review of Robert Silverberg's magnificent book, "The Mound Builders of Ancient America: The Archaeology of a Myth." A must-read for anyone interested in the archaeology and myths about ancient America. Click here:Mound Builders

Gardner's book is an essential read for any educated person. Gardner debunks creationism in a chapter entitled "Geology verses Genesis." This short essay is a masterpiece and highly recommended. It ends with the following quote from fifteen-hundred-years ago by St. Augustine:"It very often happens there is some question as to the earth or sky, or other elements of the world...respecting which, on e who is not a Christian has knowledge...and it is very disgraceful and mischievous and of all things to be carefully avoided, that a Christina speaking of such matters as being according to the Christian Scriptures, should be heard by an unbeliever talking such nonsense that the unbeliever perceiving him to be as wide from the mark as east from west, can hardly restrain himself from laughing."I would also highly recommend Robert Wauchope's "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians." Click here to see my review:Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theAnother essential book is "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg:Mound BuildersFinally, there is the short classic that every educated person should read: "The True Believer," by Eric Hoffer. Click here:The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)Hoffer's 150-page book applies perfectly to our times. Hoffer hits the mark again and again with "Machiavellian detachment" as one reviewer said. Of fanatics, Hoffer wrote:"The effectiveness of a doctrine should not be judged by its profundity, sublimity or the validity of the truths it embodies, but by how thoroughly it insulates the individual from his self and the world as it is.""The effectiveness of a doctrine does not come from its meaning but from its certitude.""It is obvious, therefore, that in order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but has to be believed in. We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand. A doctrine that is understood is shorn of its strength." (quotations from page 76)Very powerful and convincing reasoning!

I don't want to say much, except that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's the kind of film that needs to be encouraged. Four Catholic orphanage boys are chosen to go on "holiday" at hidden ocean cove. The true purpose is for a middle-aged couple to chose one of them to adopt, but the boys are bonded like real brothers. The oldest boy has his first sexual experience with a local girl.It has a surprise ending, and the photography is beautiful. Watch it.

Just sit back and enjoy this super novel. It's the best thing I've read in ages. It was a well-written story that had me turning the pages late into the night.Although it is reminiscent of "To Kill a Mockingbird," this novel stands on its own muddy west Texas ground. Set in the 1930s, its a great coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old boy who becomes involved in the search for serial killer. I don't want to give too much away, and some of the characters are stereotypes, but it's easy to pass over these things.This is a fine example of not basing your reading on negative Amazon reviews. Go with the vast majority. You won't regret it.96 Reviews: 58 five stars; 26 four stars; 6 three stars; 3 two stars, and 3 one star reviews.Another great Joe Lansdale novel is "A Fine Dark Line." Highly recommended. Here is another reason to not put too much stock in negative reviews (although they are sometimes justified).I gave it five stars: The totals were: 22 five stars, 9 four stars, and 5 three stars. Fortunately, there were no two or one star reviews. If there had been, I might have missed this wonderful novel. Check the link below.The Bottoms (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Original)A Fine Dark Line

Ron McLarty's "The Memory of Running" is a must read. It keeps going back to this extremely over-weight man's childhood. At age 45, the man never married, and then his parents are killed in a car crash. A week later, he finds out that his only sibling, a sister, has died homeless in Los Angeles. The man then takes off on his bicycle to ride from New York to Los Angeles. He gives up drinking and smoking and starts eating right. It's a real page turner.There's also his memory of a girl in a wheelchair who loves him.You'll love this story!Also excellent is "The Traveler," by McLarty. Click here:Traveler

Prescott was one of the first historians to credit the Native Americans with the founding of the ancient American civilizations; rather than some lost white race or wandering tribe of Hebrews.Maya explorer John Lloyd Stephens was another famous person from the 1840s who realized that ancient American civilization arose independently in the New World. When it is considered that almost everyone else was pointing to lost white races as the originators of these civilizations, the vision of these two men is remarkable.Nevertheless, Prescott's "Conquest of Mexico" and "Conquest of Peru" (bound together in the "Modern Library Giant" edition) are stunning as historical narratives based on original sources. What an achievement by a man who was half blind!I would rank these two volumes as the two most captivating books I ever read. The audacity and bravery (and cruelty) of the Spanish leaves your mouth agape.Read these two histories and relive the wonder of the Conquests of Mexico and Peru. Ten stars!

Robert Duvall and Michael Cane are men with a shady--though adventuresome--past when their nephew comes into their lives.The boy (Haley Joel Osment), who is left at his uncle's ranch by his mother, soon finds the home that he always wished he had. His uncles even order a lion through the mail, and in a series of flashbacks, we learn about the fantastic adventures of the two men.I don't like to tell too much about movies, but I will highly recommend this one. I love down-home movies that bring out the best in America.

Make sure you read the short story "Youth," as well as the "Heart of Darkness." Both are super, and youth is worth it for the following lines alone:"And there was somewhere in me that thought: By jove! This is the deuce of an adventure--something you read about; and it is my first voyage as second mate--and I am only twenty--and here I am lasting it out as well as any of these men, and keeping my chaps up to the mark. I was pleased. I would not have given up the experience for worlds. I had moments of exultation. Whenever the old dismantled craft pitched heavily with her counter high in the air, she seemed to me to throw up, like an appeal, like a defiance, like a cry to the clouds without mercy, the words written on her stern: "Judea, London. Do or Die."O youth! The strength of it, the faith of it, the imagination of it! To me she was not an old rattle-trap caring about eh world a lot of coal for a freight--to me she was the endeavour, the test, the trail of life. I think of her with pleasures, with affection, with great--as you would think of someone dead you have loved. I shall never forget her...pass the bottle."

This was a great novel. I especially enjoyed the characters. They were all easy to visualize.A white boy who is mute witnesses the rape of his black friend. The rape ends in a murder that he does not witness, and all kinds of problems flow from there. I don't want to tell too much of the plot, but it has a supernatural element. Set in the early 1960s in the south, the racial element plays out against this background of crime and hypocrisy in a small southern town.I would also highly recommend Son of the Endless Night, by Ferris.Son of the Endless NightIf you like coming-of-age stories (and Phantom Nights is one), then you will probably also like Summer of Night--a great story!Summer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. You don't want to re-tell the whole story. I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book.A man and his family move into a Colorado hotel in the winter. The man is the caretaker of the empty hotel, and soon weird things begin to happen. King's description of the topiary (sculpted shrubs) is wonderful. A shrub in the shape of a lion keeps moving when the man isn't looking! Talk about a creepy hotel, and every body in the family keeps doing the wrong things.You won't be able to put down this book. Highly recommended.Your comments--positive or negative--are greatly appreciated. Thanks

To be brief, I'll just point to the essay by Professor Edwin Firmage, who tells a compelling story of how he came to abandon his belief that the Book of Mormon is an ancient document. The other essays in this book are also fascinating. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Book of Mormon.Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....""Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence."Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text."To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.""The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties."

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open-mindedness in reading this review. I also want you to know that I like Mormons, and even love a few, some of whom I consider to be the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Note: Your helpful votes are appreciated. Thanks, and please check my reviews of books by Hugh Nibley and John Sorenson, as well as my review of "Echoes and Evidence for the Book of Mormon."If you would like to contact me, see the comment section below. Thanks.I'll limit my review to Palmer's comments about the "Golden Pot," German occult story. Concerning the "Golden Pot," Mormon writers have made many false assumptions and outright errors. Mormon writers who criticize Palmer's chapter on the "Golden Pot" fail to recognize that:German language almanacs were sold in Palmyra, and German immigrants to the United States constituted a higher percentage of the immigrant population than even the Irish who were digging the Erie Canal. The Palmyra bookstore would not have been selling German almanacs if there had not been a fair percentage of German speakers in the area.The rough percentages of different Ethnic groups in Pennsylvania by 1760 were: English (40%), German (30%), Scotch-Irish (20%), and 10% for other groups. So there were a lot of German immigrants in America.Significantly, there was some talk after the American Revolution about whether English or German should be the national language! In the mid-1700s, Benjamin Franklin grumbled about Philadelphia's bilingual street signs and complained that the Pennsylvania parliament would soon need German-English interpreters.In the late-1700s the parliamentary records of Pennsylvania and new state laws were published in both English and German, and the parliament of Maryland decided to publish a German-language version of the Constitution.Further, Joseph Smith was a traveler from an early age in his father's occult-based, treasure-hunting business. Thus, he repeatedly met people interested in the occult and treasure hunting, so it seems reasonable that he may have heard the story of the "Golden Pot" more than once.The Germans brought with them the occult beliefs and stories, including the story of the "Golden Pot," in which an archivist (actually a salamander) hires a young man to translate some ancient documents using magic pens.The author of the "Golden Pot," E.T.A. Hoffmann, also wrote the tale known to everyone today-The Nuctcracker, which was made into the famous ballet.The story mentions the "faculty of prophecy" and that the documents with their "strange characters" were translated with "greatest clearness and correctness." At the beginning of the story an "old hag" threatens the translator, saying "You'll end up in the crystal."Contrary to what some Mormons writers say, the first English translation of the Golden Pot (1820) preceded the Book of Mormon by ten years, a sufficient time for Hoffman's story to spread through the United States.It also appeared in a "German Romance: Specimens of it Chief Authors" (Edinburgh, 1827), translated by Thomas Carlyle. In addition, Germans told and retold Hoffmann's stories that they had read in the original German long before the English translation.Thus, the unbiased reader is drawn to the parallels between the claims of Joseph Smith and the story elements of the "Golden Pot," and Grant Palmer is correct to point out those parallels. They are very interesting.Lastly, I am surprised that any Mormon would mention FARMS in criticizing Palmer's book. FARMS has made "lying for the Lord" into an artform. In my reviews, I have shown that the men in and associated with FARMS could not tell a straight story if their pay depended on it--in fact, their pay depends on telling falsehoods or more often spinning history.Regardless of whether the LDS Church is true or not, Mormons should be very cautious when reading anything produced by FARMS.In short, I would highly recommend Grant Palmer's book.Let me add that there is not a single word or idea in Mormonism that was not in Joseph Smith's environment. The monks at Ephrata Pennsylvania had the Melchesidec priesthood, and the practice "baptism for the dead," a practice that spread far and wide.They also believed that the souls "of the just" taught people when the arrived in heaven. AND NOTE, the Whitmers (later the Book of Mormon witnesses) had lived near Ephrata before moving to New York in 1805.Added to these facts, we must mention that Harmony, Pennsylvania (the hometown of Joseph's first wife Emma Hale) was founded by the anti-tobacco prophet George Rapp, who had a 900 person commune only twelve miles down the road at Economy when Joseph Smith came to Harmony.Although Rapp preached celibacy, he had studied Emanuel Swedenborg, who taught that marriage with sex existed in heaven and produced spiritual offspring (love and truth--a breath away from Joseph Smith's literal spiritual children).So, in reality, all the elements of Mormonism were just lying around for somebody to pick up. Nevertheless, there is little or no Mormonism in the Book of Mormon, itself--no men becoming gods, no polygamy, no God living on a planet, no marriage in heaven, no temple garments, and no baptism for the dead.This is to be explained by the fact that Joseph Smith was still young (22-23) and focused on correcting the errors of Christianity. As he became more educated and stated his opinions on various issues, Mormonism evolved over a 12-year-period (roughly after 1830 to 1842).If all we had was the Book of Mormon, the LDS Church would be just another Christian sect.To read my review of the Book of Mormon, click here:The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus ChristYour comments--positive or negative--are appreciated.

"Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians." This brilliant 137-page book should not be missed by anyone interested in the archaeology of ancient America.There is an excellent chapter on "Lost Tribes and the Mormons" and another chapter on "Kon-Tiki and the Linguistic Acrobats." This last chapter is interesting because Hugh Nibley, the Mormon professor, used all the false techniques outlined by Wauchope. See: "Since Cumorah," by Hugh Nibley. Click here, then scroll down to read my review:Since Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern worldThe following outlines the technique for proving any theory about the origins of an ancient civilization:Take a word and trace it back to the beginning of time. This will produce a ton of commentary for a book. In addition, your book will sound learned. The catch is that you will not have proved anything. Professor Nibley did this with words found in the Book of Mormon. Naturally, because many of these words have biblical roots, he made all kinds of connections with the ancient world.Note the chapter on "Kon Tiki" (above): In the July 2002 issue of the "Smithsonian" magazine (p. 26), there was an article on Thor Heyerdahl entitled "Kon Artist?". The author proved that Thor Heyerdahl had actually paid an Easter Island native to manufacture models of reed boats, which Heyerdahl then claimed were ancient relics.It is amusing that Wauchope outlined what he called a crack-pot idea for the origins of the American ideas. "Perhaps the most popular theory about the American Indian origins derives the famous ancient civilizations of Mexico, Central America, and the Andes from Egypt."NOTE: Wauchope was just stating a theory he rejected. In "These Early Americans," Mormon author Paul R. Cheesman later quoted Wauchope as if he supported this view! "Robert Wauchope, a well-known scientist, summarized his feelings concerning the origin of the civilizations of the New World" (p. 24).THESE EARLY AMERICANS External Evidence of the Book of MormonClick on the following link to read my review of another great book that debunks the crackpots--"The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg.Mound Builders

This is the second time I've re-posted my review of this book.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated, and please remember that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great novel.This book hooked me from the start. I don't want to give much of it away, but a man meets a lonely woman in San Francisco, and then she dies. The man knows nothing about the woman, and he goes to her apartment and finds a book that was checked out of a Nevada library. He takes some time off work and tries to solve the mystery of her life and death. It's also a great love story of a man finding a new home.A great mystery, and not to be missed.Check out the mysterious cover illustration.

Arkady Renko, the protagonist of the "Gorky Park" series, is once again working through and outside the communist system to solve a murder linked to the dreams of great wealth at the fall of Castro.I liked the woman detective who helps Arkady. She's a Castro loyalist but quite cynical about the system that can't provide enough food for its people. The conflict between the ideals of communism and the realities was a real eye-opener (prostitution all over the place). I would describe the novel as a fun read.Because I collect book covers, I also loved the one on the hardback edition (not shown here) that pictures a empty Havana street at night. So evocative of tropical intrigue and under-the-surface violence.

Note: I have made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books attempting to prove the Book of Mormon, and I get a negative vote almost as soon as my review is posted.Oh, well. Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks. A short review (recommendation) can be a good review if it leads you to reading a great novel.This 208-page novel leads you on as twelve-year-old Patrick Quincannon Tolson spends his time spying to find out the truth of his birth. It's tender southern story that follows the tradition of "To Kill A Mockingbird" without that story's darker implications. I loved both, however.Buy an old copy with the cover illustration of a boy in a tree spying down at a young couple kissing. It really captures the whole novel.If you haven't read it, you're in for a real treat.Also, check out the "Moonflower Vine," by Jetta Carlson.The Moonflower Vine

Sixteen-year-old Victor runs away from his abusive father and has some great adventures during World War II off the coast and in the swamps of Alabama.

ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. So here it goes:I have no hesitation is saying that the "Dumb Ox," a biography of St. Thomas Aquinas, is one of the most powerful books I ever read. Chesterton's reasoning is relentless--dragging us back into the Middle Ages whether we want to go there or not!Some parts of this thin volume are very humorous. Speaking of Luther, Chesterton says, "He destroyed Reason and substituted suggestion."Chesterton's book is an essential read for educated people. When he called the Inquisition "a dubious experiment," however, I just couldn't go there (the Inquisition was a nightmare).The non-Catholic who reads this book can expect to be put on the rack until he concedes something.

This is a super adventure novel. The body of a Roman gladiator is cut of out the ice in the North Sea, and, of course, the gladiator is revived. His experiences in the modern world are wonderfully portrayed.I loved the part where the gladiator tells a nun that the New Testament apostle James, I believe, was a disgrace. He says something to the effect that he was crucified upside down. Thus, the gladiator unintentionally confirms a Christian belief. I love playing with ideas, and this detail from the novel has stayed with me all these years.The gladiator also gets in a fight with an Olympic fencer. My advise: Don't fight Roman gladiators.

Unless your religion requires that you believe in Atlantis, you will find that De Camp presents powerful arguments against the crackpot claims about Atlantis. He tells a compelling history that is supported by the solid scholarship that is often lacking in many books on Atlantis. You will find yourself amazed at the forgotten history that De Camp uncovers, such as the following:"One contributor to this stream of speculation was Francis Wilford, who in 1805 advanced an Atlanto-Druidic hypothesis according to which the British Isles were a remnant of a former Atlantic continent where the events of the Old Testament had actually taken place (and not in Palestine as most people thought)" (p. 187).De Camp gives the following caution that the crackpots will never accept:"Myths and legends, then, do often have a basis of fact. But the factual part of the myth may be so small and muddled that you cannot possibly reconstruct history from the legend. As the historian Grote said: `The lesson must be learnt, hard and painful thought it may be, that no imaginable reach of the critical acumen will of itself enable us to discriminate fancy from realty, in the absence of a tolerable stock of evidence" (p. 250).See also my five-star reviews of "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians," by Robert Wauchope, and "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg.

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews as soon as they are posted. Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and note that even Mormons should read this book.Robert Silverberg tells the fascinating history of the rise and fall of the myth of the Mound Builders in a massively-researched book. Not many people know, for example, that the myth of the Mound Builders was finally laid to rest by the work of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1870s and 1880s under the direction of John Wesley Powell, the Civil War hero and one-armed explorer of the Colorado River (note "Lake Powell).By 1800, the mystery of the tens of thousands of mounds in the eastern United States called out for a solution, and that solution was not to be found in the Native Americans, who were considered too lazy to have constructed such great works. The mounds had to have been the work of some superior lost white race--notably the ancient Hebrews, but also others.Prejudice was so strong that few, if any, scholars believed that the Indians, themselves, constructed the mounds (the view from our time). The logic of racial superiority, national pride, religion, and the pocketbook demanded a history in which the Indians killed off an ancient white race of "Mound Builders."A vast continent lay at the feet of a young nation, and the only thing obstacle to its settlement were the Indians. Silverberg writes with brilliance and humor: "The dream of a lost prehistoric race in the American heartland was profoundly satisfying; and if the vanished ones had been giants, or white men, or Israelites, or Danes, or Toltecs, or giant white Jewish Toltec Vikings, so much the better."Silverberg sees both "Manuscript Found" (1812) and the Book of Mormon (1830) as expressions of the Mound Builder myth. In about 1812, the Reverend Solomon Spaulding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. A narrator in the story claimed to have found 28 parchment scrolls, which he translated. The scrolls tell the story of a shipload of Roman Christians who are blown across the ocean to America. Once here they meet the fair-skinned race of Mound Builders.That civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has "epistles"), "Censors" are the rulers ("Judges" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands. The mound builders also have horses and "mamoons" (mammoths).The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). The white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher ("Bosaka" in "Manuscript Found" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In a last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Silverberg is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. "Neutral observers," he writes, "generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding" (p. 96).Silverberg continues this compelling history by showing that the Mound Builder myth continued independently of its expression in the Book of Mormon (1830). By 1839, the vastly popular play "Behemoth" had audiences transfixed with its portrayal of "Behemoth," rogue mastodon who destroyed the mound builders. Whole armies attack Behemoth, and even forts were of no protection against the raging mastodon!During the early 1800s, copper Indian ornaments (described as "plates") were found in the mounds, and some of these ornaments were even mistaken for parts of swords. From such errors, the mound builders were soon thought to have had iron and steel. And so the myth grew (Thomas Jefferson was among the few who thought that the Indians themselves constructed the mounds).Read this book if you would like some perspective on why a book like the Book of Mormon would emerge during the early 1800s. It is a brilliant unraveling of a forgotten part of American history.See my negative, one-star reviews of books by Mormon authors: "Echoes and Evidences," "By the Hand of Mormon," "Lehi in the Deseret," and others.

On page 53, Wirth has a picture of a "Horse at Chichen Itza." This Maya carving from the Temple of the Wall Panels is certainly not a horse. Even in this photo, you can see the backwards "S" shape of a feathered Jaguar-serpent. The feather is the head of this supposed "horse."On page 29, Wirth says that the "Indians do not grow beards--this is a genetic fact." This is another falsehood. Montezuma, an Indian's Indian if there ever was one, had a beard. Native Americans generally have lighter facial hair than Caucasions, but they can and do grow beards. In ancient times, Maya mothers put hot clothes on the faces of their boy children to stunt the later growth of beards. Many writers have refuted the beardless Indian myth, including James Adair (History of the American Indians, 1775). Adair lived among the Indians for some thirty years and married an Indian woman. Adair said that the beardless Indian myth "is utterly destitute of foundation" (p. 3).Wirth's false notion about beards on Native American men allows her and others to claim that bearded statues in ancient Mexico represent white men.Wirth also makes claims about Stela 5 at Izapa (p. 68). Most Mormon scholars have now distanced themselves from the so-called Lehi "Tree of Life Stone." The carving is not technically a tree, but representation of a crocodile (it even has eyes at the base). Wirth does not mention that there are other such "dragon trees" at Izapa.On page 94, Wirth repeats the discredited scholarship of John Welch. Wirth says that the first book on parallelsims (chiasms) was published by John Forbes in 1854. This is simply false. Knowledge about the parallelisms in Hebrew poetry goes back to the 1700s and Robert Lowth's "The Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews."Thomas Hartwell Horne (see my other reviews) also presented detailed diagrams (how-to-compose examples) in his book. Also, any edition of Lowth's "Isaiah" that contains a "Preliminary Dissertation" has these detailed examples and commentary. Go to the free "Worldcat" data base of published materials. On the "advanced search" type in 1800 to 1830 and the name Robert Lowth or Thomas Hartwell Horne to confirm my facts.On page 113, Wirth has a picture and drawing of Stela 3 at La Venta, Mexico. This "Uncle Sam" figure is supposed to be a white man (see the bearded Indian myth above). If he is a Nephite, though, he is a strange one. This half-naked man is wearing a human head as a pendant from his necklace.In Milton R. Hunter's "Archaeology and the Book of Mormon" (page 229), this same figure appears with its chin beard airbrushed into the shoulder. This is clear in any other reproduction of the "Uncle Sam" figure.Such disreputable and illogical attempts to turn bearded Indians into white Nephites are as amusing as their are false.Wirth should have spent more time researching her sources, but then her book would not have been written for lack of achaeological evidence.Your comments--good or bad--are appreciated.

Here's some wonderful lines from Robert McCammon's Boy's Life."See, this is my opinion: we all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up, for God's sake. And you know why we were told that? Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic they knew made them ashamed and sad of what they'd allowed to wither in themselves."McCammon wrote the following wonderful poem as a preface to his story.We ran like young wild furies,where angels feared to tread.The woods were dark and deep.Before us demons fled.We checked Coke bottle bottomsto see how far was far.Our worlds of magic wonderwere never reached by car.We loved our dogs like brothers,our bikes like rocket ships.We were going to the stars,to Mars we'd make round trips.We swung on vines like Tarzan,and flashed Zorro's keen blade.We were James Bond in his Aston,we were Hercules unchained.We looked upon the futureand we saw a distant land,where our folks were always ageless,and time was shifting sand.We filled up life with living,with grins, scabbed knees, and noise.In glass I see an older man,but this book's for the boys.

Note: There are a couple Mormons who are angry over my negative reviews of books written in defense of the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews. Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.As for this fantasy, I read all three books in this series, and I enjoyed them very much. I would only say in criticism that the hero's pain (angst) was at times overbearing. Too much of it, but the story kept me going. I loved the "cavewrights."I would criticize Donaldson for mining the dictionary in writing his books. It slowed down the reading--too many words to look up in certain sections, so much so that I circled a bunch on two pages just for the fun of it. I think this detracted from the writing.In spite of those criticisms, I would highly recommend the "Chronicles." There were a lot of great adventures and characters.Which did I like the most--"Chronicles" or "Lord of the Rings"? I would say "Lord of the Rings," because I read that trilogy first and because I sympathized with the main character more. "Chronicles" is a more mature book, I would say--deeper and darker, but a great fantasy.

I've watched this movie twice because I liked it so much. A woman answers an ad placed bya farmer, and the two people slowly fall in love. I always hate to say too much about movies,but trust me, this is worth watching. Highly recommended.Another similar movie that you will like is "The Polish Bride," where a woman escapes from aforced prostitution ring and winds up at a farmer's house. Watch both.Under the Sun (Under Solen)The Polish Bride (I watched "The Polish Bride" on Netflix, and it had English subtitles.).La Novia Polaca (De Poolse Bruid) (The Polish Bride) [NTSC/Region 4 Import-Latin America] by Karim Tradia (Spanish subtitles)

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksThis book should be on the shelf of anyone who loves poetry. Untermeyer does not simply present a poem, he gives insightful, short reviews of the poets life and of his or her poems.I own dozen collections of poetry, and I would say this book is the best one I own. I bought it new decades ago, and it's falling apart.We have all heard many of these poems before, but it is wonderful to read them again. Take the life-long suffering of William Ernest Henley (1849-1903), who had to have his leg amputated as a child.Here is one stanza from "Invictus," or Victory.It matter not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.And how wonderfully eloquent is the poem by Steven Spender (1909--) in his praise of unsung heroes:They wore their hearts at the fire's center,Born of the sun they traveled a short while towards the sun,And left the vivid air signed with their honor.

Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. I seem to have angered a Mormon over my negative reviews of books attempting to proof the Book of Mormon is an ancient document and not Joseph Smith's religious novel.This person gives me a negative vote almost as soon as my reviews are posted. Oh, well. To be so threatened by the facts.The plot of the "Seventh Scroll" grabbed me and wouldn't let go. A woman archaeologist and her husband find an Egyptian scroll that leads to the lost tomb of a pharaoh. The husband of Royan is murdered for the scroll, Royan escapes, and is soon aided by an Indiana Jones character named Nicholas. The wealthy Nicholas funds an expedition, and Nicholas and Royan head off to Ethiopia and find a lost tomb that had been ingeniously hidden by a river.I don't want to give the story away, but I really got lost in this grand adventure. I had to overlook the fact that Smith referred to his previous novel "The River God" in this novel. That takes the reader out of the story, in my opinion. It sounded like an ad for "River God," and makes me less likely to read that novel.Overall, it kept me turning the pages. If you haven't read "Cry Wolf," by Wilbur Smith, then you are in for another treat of an African adventure. An Indiana Jones character in the 1930s takes a convoy of armored cars into the Ethiopian highlands with the Italian army in hot pursuit.We should all urge Hollywood to make these two novels into movies. We need some new takes on the Indiana Jones genre. Go for it, Hollywood!Click here for Cry Wolf:Cry Wolf

Consider this facinating plot. You wake up in the body of another person, and of course, the other person wakes up in your body. In this case, the bad guy acquires all of the possessions of the good guy, who is only left with a more youthful body and dozens of people who hate him.I don't want to say anymore and ruin the story, but I could not put this book down. Highly recommended.Thanks for your "helpful" vote for my short recommendation--the highest recommendation, I might add.Also, check out Richard Laymon's "Body Rides," a fascinating novel with a similar theme.Body Rides

This novel, like "Trader" by Charles De Lint, grabbed me and wouldn't let go. Laymon is a super writer of scary stories. A man finds that he can move all over the city by thought with the aid of a magic bracelet. It's a real page-turner with a good dose of sex.Check out Laymon's "Island" (a great read! People stranded on an island ).IslandAlso, read "Night in Lonesome October." Enter the strange night world of a college town when a young man is dumped by his girlfriend. Restless, Tom begins the wonder the town on foot late at night, and he runs into all kinds of mysterious characters and even finds a new love.A real grabber.Night in the Lonesome OctoberCheck out the "Trader," by Charles De Lint. An old man wakes up in a young man's body and vise versa. The only problem is that the young punk now has the old guy's money.Trader (Newford)Highly recommended!Also check out "Animal Hour," by Andrew Klavan. A woman goes to work and nobody recognizes her.

I would recommend this book as a good reference. Frey fulfills his promise that the book is a "step-by-step no nonsense guide to dramatic storytelling."The title of chapter two gives a flavor of the book. "The Three Greatest Rules of Dramatic Writing: Conflict! Conflict! Conflict!"This is, of course, true. Without a character who faces a problem, your story is like a sheet in the wind.In writing this review, I thumbed Frey's book and found it to be a great review of writing concepts.

Repeat the following three times: The quack cures diseases people don't have! NAET is a scam. I went to an expert who was trained by the founder of this quackery. He had twenty-five years of experience. Did his vials and methods cure me? Of course, not. A lot of people are hypochondriacs, and self diagnose their disease. Then, of course, the quack produces a cure for something they did NOT actually have.The arm lowering technique is simply a parlor trick! I proved it one my friend, a big man who lifts weights. He laid on his back and raised his arm and held it stiff. I could NOT push it down. Then I had him try it again. This time I moved his arm slightly backward, then down easily. Quack! Quack! Quack!There is, of course, the plecebo effect--a real phenomena. People who took two sugar pills got better faster than those who took one.

Note: Some immature Mormon is angry over my negative reviews of books written to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksI was disappointed that one reviewer only gave this wonderful biography three stars. It deserves five. I thought he gave a good review, but he ended on a negative and illogical note. He said, "I don't think anyone could be disappointed in this book if they are interested in either the time period or David Zeisberger. As a book on Zeisberger, this should be a 5 star, but as a book in general, a 3 is about it." ???Olmstead's biography of David Zeisberger, the compassionate missionary to the Indians in the 1700s, is well written and fascinating. The book is not about the origins of Mormonism, but Olmstead's portrait of Zeisberger's world provides many insights into the origins of Mormonism.In describing the religious and culturally diverse melting pot that was the early United States, Olmstead prepares the reader for the study of the origins of Mormonism. Colonial diversity was striking. As early as 1646, there were more than eighteen European languages spoken in the Hudson River Valley and with them, of course, sprang fountains of cultural and religious folklore.It is now possible to see how, almost of necessity, that the religious stew that had been brewing in the 1700s would boil over into something new in the early 1800s. Consider the population of Pennsylvania about the time of the American Revolution.There were a myriad of Indian groups, and the settlers consisted of German, English, Scotch-Irish, Scots, Swedes, Finns, Dutch, French, Welsh, Swiss, and black Africans. There were more religious denominations than European groups, among them English Quakers, German Quakers, Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, German Pietists, Mennonites, German Baptist Brethren, Schwenkfelders, Moravians, Lutherans, Reformed Germans, Anglicans, Dutch Reformed, Jews, Roman Catholics, Huguenots, and smaller sects such as Conrad Beisel's Seventh-Day Baptist Monks and Nuns at Ephrata (p. 113).Had Earl P. Olmsted in his life of David Zeisberger been concerned with the origins of Mormonism, he might also have mentioned that Conrad Beisel practiced baptism for the dead and was invested with the Melchisedek priesthood. Conrad Weiser, another Ephrata monk, took the name of "Enoch," the same name later used by Joseph Smith. The monks at Ephrata also strongly opposed infant baptism and the use of alcohol and tobacco.Thus, as always in the world, the young stand on the unique foundation of the previous generation. Zeisberger, the great Moravian missionary among the Indians, and translator of the Bible into Indian languages, died in 1808 when Joseph Smith was just three years old. The Indians and Indian Wars of the Northeast had already passed into stories told by men sitting around the general store.The rough percentages of different Ethnic groups in Pennsylvania by 1760 were: English (40%), German (30%), Scotch-Irish (20%), and 10% for other groups. So there were a lot of German immigrants in America. (p. 136).Significantly, there was some talk after the American Revolution about whether English or German should be the national language!

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.On "The Sword of Laban": Morain has established beyond all doubt that Joseph Smith was not your "average man." For example, Morain's observations about Joseph Smith's two leg-bone operations as a child (age 7) are compelling. The affects extreme pain (burns and other injuries) is well known and does change the child's personality and way of looking at the world..When Joseph Smith set out to compose the Book of Mormon at age twenty-two, he was far from an average person in his depth of experience. He had moved some seven times before age twelve; he had been a Bible reader from age twelve; he had suffered two horrific leg operations without anesthetic; he had also suffered the death of his beloved brother, Alvin.When Joseph Smith began composing the Book of Mormon at age twenty-two, he was a married man (a maturing factor). Then just after composing 116 pages of the Book of Mormon (which were lost), his infant son died (another maturing factor). Then Joseph Smith waited some nine months (planning time) before he began again on the Book of Mormon (a little work in between).From first line to last line, the Book of Mormon was a year-long project that Joseph Smith completed at age twenty three. Thus, Joseph Smith was in no sense a "farm boy," as is often claimed by Mormon writers, who also confuse his teenage visions with his dictating of the Book of Mormon as a mature adult.Morain's book is highly recommended, especially for its insights into the affects of extreme pain on children and how such events influenced Joseph Smith's view of the world.Check out my one-star reviews of books written by Mormons in defense of the Book of Mormon.

Don't let the negative reviews keep you from this high-voltage novel. I couldn't putit down. Without going into the details, I'll say that a man who lost his wife, findsanother woman, but she is being chased by a criminal organization (Suspend belief anddon't worry about the "violent and implausible" aspects, as one negative reviewer said).This novel is a perfect example of why you should not read the negative reviews. Thosereviewers needed to chill out and just go for it. It makes me wonder how many greatstories I missed because I had to click on those one-star reviews (often justified). Thereis some truth in the negative reviews, but the power of the plot steamrolled those objectionsin my mind. I think the key was that the Klavan (a super talented writer) waited until wayinto the novel to reveal the "implausible" elements. By then, I was hooked!There was laughter in a dangerous situation, but I sped past that flaw. Then, a littlemoonbeam philosophy. A man has an afterlife vision and sees Jesus and other charactersfrom history sitting at a big table--the good and bad--Jesus, Stalin, Hitler, AND THEY ALL "UNDERSTAND"EACH OTHER! Ha! The problem with evil men is not one of "understanding." Good and evilpeople understand each other. The evil people just don't care about such things. Well,I had to comment on this little glitch. BUT, roll on and read this great story.Another novel by Andrew Klavan that I would highly recommend is "Animal Hour." A womangoes to her job at a law office and noboby recognizes her--a grabber of a plot.Animal HourAnother grabber is "Trader," by Charles DeLint. An old man wakes up in the body of a youngman and vice versa. Problem: The young punk now has all the old man's money and property!Trader

Some spoilers coming up:The movie seemed too long, and it never addressed the devastation caused by the death of a child. The way it threw in god and Jesus made me think it was produced by an evangelical church.A mother's little girl dies, and the mother is simply inspired by her billionaire boyfriend building a hospital--with a chapel, he had to add (hint, hint, you need to go to church if you want to get cured). Where is the reality of an emotionally destroyed parent?I really liked the young girl character. She was fun to listen to, and one of my objections to the movie plot was killing her off. We don't care how much fear and tension is in a movie or novel, but we want the good guys to win. Even in page-turners where a lot of good guys get killed, we want a happy or at least satisfying ending. This movie attempted the satisfying ending with the flight of a butterfly (supposedly the girl's spirit.If they wanted a religious theme, then have the girl saved by a miracle. How about the boyfriend trying to decide whether to invest in some polluting industry or basic cancer research. He finally decides on basic research, and a discovery made and the girl is cured!Also, that hooky statue of Jesus was a bit much. In fact, that whole scene was a heavy handed nod to born-again Christians.The ancient Greek Thucydides in his "History of the Peloponnesian Wars" said of the plague in Athens: "As for the gods, it seemed one and the same whether you worshiped them or not, when you saw the good and the bad dying indiscriminately." If a novel or movie about the death of a child doesn't address this issue, then it's just cotton candy for the mind.

Note: Mormons have been slamming my reviews, so I would appreciate your "helpful" vote. Obviously they don't want you to read anything that might refute the claims of the Book of Mormon.On Ceram's book:Ceram provides his readers with the kind of quality writing that never goes out of style, and although much new information has come to light in the past thirty years, Ceram's archaeological survey of North America is still solid.Ceram's detailed deconstruction of crackpot theories is excellent. Concerning wide theories about the origins of the American Indians, he writes that these theories have been "eliminated either as wrong or--for example, the theories of the 'ten lost tribes of Israel," of Atlantis and Mu--as simply nonsensical" (p. 347).Then there is the following great line concerning crackpot theories: "They must be given their due; by contrast with their specious glitter, the light of science shines all the more brightly" (p. 252).Two other essential books on ancient America are "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg, and "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians," by Robert Wauchope.

Note: It looks like I have offended some Mormons who don't want you to read this book. Nevertheless, science won't go away. Your "helpful" votes are appreciatedSchele and Freidel's book takes you into the mind of the ancient Maya, where bloodletting induced visions that opened doors into the world of pagan spirits and everyone had an animal "familiar."The description of the "War of Conquest" of Tikal (tee-kal) against Uaactun (wa-shak-toon) is riviting. It is fascinating that we know the name of the general of Tikal, "Smoking-Frog." At other places, we now also know the names of the Maya leaders. "Ah Zacol...governed Lacanja for Knot-eye-Jaguar, the king of Bonampak." Other names are equally strange. I won't list the name of one king because Amazon's filter's would reject my review. Anyway, his name was "p-n-s of the jaguar."I came to my interest in the Maya from my early encounters with Mormon authors who used specious scholarship to connect the Maya to the religious novel called the "Book of Mormon." Now that Maya writing has been deciphyered, all those false claims have been exposed. In many cases, the truth was known, but Mormon writers were engaging in the practice of lying for the Lord to promote their faith.When the Spanish first saw Maya art, they misinterpreted it. They named one temple, for example, the "temple of the cross." The cross-like tree was seen as evidence that the Maya were Christians. Now we know that in the case of the temple of the "Foliated Cross" that the cross-bar of the cross is actually a maize plant with a "human head as an ear of maize." The maize plant is growing out of the "waterlily monster."It was interesting to learn that the upright stone monuments, or stela, were known as "tree-stones" and the doorways into the temples were represented as the mouths of mountain monsters. The doorways are seen as caves into the mountain."Bloodletting, the focus ritual of Maya life, was the instrument" of the materialization of other-worldly beings.The claims of Mormons and others that Stela B at Copan depicts elephant trunks was refuted even before the translation of the Maya glyphs. The trunks are actually the long beaks of macaws (you can see the colorful birds there today). The false claim is now doubly refuted because the writing on the stela refers to "macaw mountain," a nearby hill--not "elephant mountain."Mormons are still claiming that there is a horse carved on the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itza. It is actually a damaged feathered-serpent (one feather hangs down to make the so-called horse's head). In reality, the Maya were so ignorant of horses that when Cortes left his lame horse among the Itza, they fed it meat.The strange diet cause the horse to die and the Maya made a statue, calling it "Tzimin Chac," from the "Tzmin," meaning tapir (the animal most similar his general shape to a horse), and "Chac," the god of rain and thunder. When Father Urbita came to convert the Itza, he destroyed the idol at great risk to his life.The Book of Mormon connection to ancient mesoamerica is without foundation. As you go back in time, the paganism only increases. There was no Hebrew civilization in mesoamerica.This 500-page book belongs on the shelf on anyone interested in the mind of the ancient Maya.

There are a lot of psychological and social theories about "Robinson Crusoe," but I just take it as a grand adventure. I loved all the details of how he survived after being shipwrecked on that island. Just remember that it was written in the seventeenth century so you have to get used to writing.I have a warm place in my heart for Robinson Crusoe. Some fifty years ago in the second grade, my teacher read it to our class. Decades later, I told my wife about it, but she said that it was impossible. Robinson Crusoe is too difficult for a teacher to read to second graders.Well, several years went by, and I was proved right. In a used bookstore, I bought a copy of "The Story of Robinson Crusoe in words of One Syllable," with "Colored Illustrations." The book was published in about 1900, and when my teacher read it to her class, the book was over fifty years old.Since then I have collected paperback editions of "Robinson Crusoe" for their neat covers, and this one is really nice.If you like shipwrecked-on-an-island stories, read Richard Laymon's "Island." It's a page-turner of a modern murder mystery.Island

When I read this novel back in the 1960s, I was struck how it played on the anti-communist paranoia of the 1950s. Written in 1951, it tells of the story of aliens who take over human bodies, and there is no way to tell friend from foe--except by looking at a person's bare back. The only defense is to shoot anyone wearing a shirt (man or woman).Highly recommended, and it's a story that will stick in your mind.If you haven't read Heinlein, you are in for a treat.

Wow, does King know how to write. I just kept turning the pages and forgot about the cell phones. I had a hard time accepting the premise that you could drive half the world crazy (turning people into raving maniacs) by just answering a cell phone. I could accept the idea of a strange virus killing everybody as in the "Stand," but the cell-phone idea seemed contrived. I just couldn't buy it. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the story.

I think the other reviewer missed the point of the whole book. It presents the philosophy of Humanism without bitterness against religion. If you're looking for an attack on religion, don't buy this book. If you're looking for insight into humanism, then it's a great buy (cheaper used editions available).It is a book to thumb through and find inspiration. Almost every page has a beautiful rare engraving that makes the book worthwhile even without the quotations that match the engravings so perfectly. It is in reality an great art book that has been overlooked because of it's title.Yes, the author includes a small amount of his own commentary, but this only enriches the quotations and gives them context. And, of course, with so many quotations, how can they all be consistent? This is as it should be. This is the nature of life. "Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds," is one of several great quotations from Emerson.There are many witty engravings that stand out. One shows "A preacher pointing to Scripture, arguing with an angel from God!" The quotation that goes with it is: "For, he argues razor-witted/That can't be which is not permitted." By Christian Morgenstern (1805-1867). Subtle humor!There are also quotations from the great poets. John Donne's "No Man Is An Island," for example. Below it is an engraving of a bell tower, and on the opposite page is an engraving of a man standing by a wall looking out at the bell tower on the opposite page. The facing engravings are a perfect match for Donne's famous lines.There are quotations from the Bible, but the Bible is our common heritage and should be mined for its beauty and inspiration. For example (Proverbs 30:18-19): "There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: the way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid."How beautiful--especially when the opposite page shows an old man offering a young woman a chest of jewels and a young man with his hand over his heart. The engraving is by Willaim Bouguereau (1825-1905) and is entitled, "Between Love and Riches." The book is full of such engravings and little-known quotations.There is an engraving of a sunset with these lines from Matthew Arnold (1822-1888). The selection is titled, "An Answer To Paul" (New Testament).Is it so small of thingTo have enjoyed the sun,To have lived light in the spring,To have loved, to have thought, to have don;To have advanced true friends, andbeat down baffling foes?On another page has a rare engraving of a man tripping over an ankor as he chases an angel and below that is an engraving of a bunch of men hanging from a tree. The quotation that goes with it is from the poet John Keats: "Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave a paradise for a sect."Another page shows a goat about to headbutt winged figure. The quotation that goes with it is from the philosopher Will Durant (1885-1981): "The cleverest defenders of a faith are its greatest enemies; for their subtleties engender doubt and stimiluate the mind."There is a very impressive comparison of Creationism with Evolution. On the one page is a rare engraving showing God pulling Eve out of Adam's side, and on the opposite page is the "Tower of Time" showing man rising up from the apes.Another engravings shows a man asleep on a mountain trail with a nude "mountain sprite" teasing him with a rose. Opposite this picture are Thomas H. Huxley's great lines on "The Splendor of Man's Capacities." It goes in part that man is "...of one substance with the dullest clay, but raised by inward forces to that place of proud and seemingly inaccessible glory."There's an engraving of two Catholic priests laughing their heads off. The author entitled it, "A Good Story, the Medicine of Philosophy." He has a great sense of humor in quoting Archbishop Temple: "My aunt," Bishop Temple said, "was suddenly prevented from going on a voyage in a ship that went down--would you call that a case of Providential interference?" The other man says, "Can't tell; didn't know your aunt."This is a great book that deserves a place on the shelf of anybody with an open mind and a sense of humor about their own beliefs (either skeptics or believers).The cover is beautiful, too. The rare engraving shows "Time Pulling Truth To Light" (out of the dark clouds of ignorance).

I thoroughly enjoyed Sister Wendy's book. It's a great collection of great art, and well described for a non-artist like me.Also, if you like black-and-white engravings from the 19th century, check out "A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought." Although it contains many quotations from the Humanist perspective, it is full of wonderful rare engravings. It's an art book that has been overlooked because of it's title.Both these book belong on art collectors shelves. Click here to see images:A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought

Reading this book will not guarantee that you will write a great novel, but does point out many things to avoid. Get rid of as many adverbs as possible and replace them with stronger verbs.Example:He walked slowly down the street. (Drop "slowly." The man's speed should be indicated by the context of the passage.)Better: He strolled down the street. (Walking is boring. Try another verb once in a while.)Marshall notes that readers like surprises. Your novel should have three or four surprises. The first surprise should come at the end of the beginning. Marshall's book is filled with such gems.Writing is an art that can be learned. Some people are born with the gift, but that does not mean the rest of us can't learn the craft.I would highly recommend the "Marshal Plan." I got a lot out of it.

Set in the modern Australian outback, this novel is a real grabber. A traveler picks up a young woman hitchhiker, and she takes him to a very strange town, from which he cannot leave. A great adventure and highly recommended.I would also highly recommend the other two Douglas Kennedy novels I have read--"The Job" and especially "The Big Picture" (I stayed up to two o'clock reading this story of a lawyer who kills his neighbor, takes over the man's identity, and disappears, starting a new life with the man's trust-fund checks).The Big Picture

It is not often noted, but nowhere will you find more beautiful descriptions of nature than in Don Quixote. Check the following description of the morning ("Aurora," of course, is the goddess of dawn)."And now a thousand kinds of little painted birds began to warble in the trees, and with their blithe and jocund notes they seemed to welcome and salute the fresh Aurora, who already was showing her beautiful countenance through the gates and balconies of the East, shaking from her tresses countless liquid pearls. The plants, bathing in that fragrant moisture, seemed likewise to shed a spray of tiny white gems, the willow trees distilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks murmured, and the meadows clad themselves in all their glory at her coming."One critic said that just when the comedy in Don Quixote is at its best, its meaning is most profound. I agree. I read Don Quixote when I was fifty (the same age Don Quixote set out on his adventures).I loved the Signet Classics edition translated by Walter Starkie, but there is a lot to be gained by reading the introductions to other editions. I own five different translations, and the introductory essays are excellent.Critics have often called Don Quixote an "accidental masterpiece." It is as if Cervantes set out to tell a good story with many funny scenes, but by the end, the combination of all these incidents had revealed an astounding work of art.What are we to make of this idealist who bashes innocent people about the head, leaving them on the ground with blood running out of their ears. As a modern man, I had real problems with that sort of humor--if it was humor. Ah, and there's the rub! said Hamlet.

Note: I made some immature person angry by giving negative reviews to books attempting to "prove the Book of Mormon." Rather than answer my criticisms, this person, who feels threatened by the facts, gives my reviews negative votes. Oh, well.Your helpful votes are appreciated, and please remember that a short review (or recommendation) can still be good if it leads you to a good book.I've enjoyed thumbing through this book many times. It has a bunch of scantily clad females (racy in the old days, but quaint today), and they are either in crimes stories or characters in science-fiction stories.I'll just list some great covers:Page 26: "Dracula"--this cover shows Dracula creeping up to a sleeping blond woman--amusing.Page 113: "Revolt of the Triffids" has a city scene with a strange green plant attacking a woman, whose blouse revealing.Page 208: "Beyond the Farthest Star." This cover by an Edgar Rice Burroughs story shows a cat-like creature looking through an opening in a jungle at some astronauts who have crashed in their strange airplane.Page 135: This cover is over the top. It shows a green-faced man smoking a "Marihuana" cigarette. Under the cigarette is a woman lying down in her purple dress. "A cheap and evil girl sets a hopped-up killer against a city."Oh, for the good-old days of paperback covers!I would recommend buying a used copy. You'll enjoy it.

Rather than answer my criticism, this person automatically gives my reviews negative votes. Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated, and please remember that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book.I love "Daybreak" (see cover) with a nude figure standing above a girl sleeping in a columned pavilion. If you like this painting, then check out different reproductions (the colors vary widely and change the nature and mood of the painting. Really change it."Twilight" is another great painting. For me, it is evocative of a great mystery. You want to step into that farm yard and explore the house and barn. No people are shown, but it gives me the feeling that ghosts live there (without being scary--in a dreamy sense)."Afterglow" is also intreguing, showing a New England church as the stars come out.The book is full of both color and black-and-white illustrations. I would love to see "Landing of the Brazen Boatman" in color. A robed figure is walking down some stairs of a strange temple while a boatman awaits.What a gift of imagination Maxfield Parrish left to the world!Highly recommended.

This book is scholarly and well documented, and Leonard J. Arrington and Davis Bitton are to be praised for giving a fair hearing to Fawn Brodie's "No Man Knows My History."Speaking of the Book of Mormon (p. 15), they write: "Fawn Brodie, Joseph Smith's eminent but unsympathetic biographer, has advanced the second principal countertheory of the book's orgins." They then go on to fully present Brodie's view of Joseph Smith.Continuing, Arrington and Bitton present the Mormon view: "Mormons insist that Smith's limited education made it impossible for him to produce such a long and complicated book by himself. The issues in the book are seen by defenders as universal, and likey to have aroused interest in ancient times as well as in modern America."Such objective and unemotional scholarship is refreshing and stands in marked contrast to that of BYU Professor Hugh Nibley, who, for example, illogically invisioned Joseph Smith being both a translator and illiterate (!) (see "Lehi in the Desert," p. 32). In speaking of the disappearing gold plates, Nibley said illogically that they would be "very disruptive" today and that the present paper edition of the Book of Mormon is "more miraculous than any gold plates would be" (see, "An Approach to the Book of Mormon, p. 18).See my one-star reviews of Nibley's books--"Lehi in the Desert," "Since Cumorah," and "An Approach to the Book of Mormon."Lehi in the Desert, the World of the Jaredites, There Were Jaredites (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 5)Since Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the modern worldAn Approach to the Book of Mormon (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 6)Mormon scholars Arrington and Bitton, as well as Richard Bushman, have taken a higher and more logical road than Hugh Nibley, the former big-gun of Mormon scholarship.In short, Arrington and Bitton deserve the praise of the Utah Historical Quarterly, "An excellent book...it should be read by Mormons and non-Mormons alike."The Saturday Review called it, "A remarkably intelligent and open-minded official history."As a non-Mormon, I admire Arrington and Bitton's book, "The Mormon Experience," for its reasoned approach to Mormon history.

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews as soon as they are posted. Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.This book is worth it for one story alone--the "Willows," by Algernon Blackwood. Just imagine camping on a willowy island in the Danube River. I hope the following first lines will make you feel that my little review was worth reading."After leaving Vienna, and long before you come to Budapest, the Danube enters a region of singular loneliness and desolation, where its waters spread away on all sides regardless of a main channel, and the country becomes a swamp for miles upon miles, covered by a vast sea of low willow bushes."A great collection of other stories, too.When an author has a name like "Algernon Blackwood," you know the story has to be good.I enjoyed most of the stories because like the "Willows," they set up a mood of mystery. A great collection for a rainy day read.

I loved this book. The story is told in the first person, but the author uses an ingenious device to get into the heads of the other characters.I couldn't stop reading. Highly recommended, and if you haven't read "The Big Picture," then do so. You are in for a treat with either of these two novels.

Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.I ask you, how can a person with a sense of adventure possibly resist a title like "Ten Thousand Islands"? It sounds great and it is.Doc Ford is up to more adventures and a lifestyle that appeals to men. I mean, he's not married, he lives in the stilt house in Florida, has a lot of friends (some quirky like Tomlinson, a wonderful character), and he has a lot of lady friends. Doc Ford's background is mirky, a lot of it spent on secret missions for a CIA type of organization.The average man will get lost most of White's novels, sailing away with him on some grand adventure.I've enjoyed all of Randy Wayne White's novels. If you're not in the mood to read, then get them on CD. Ron McLarty does a super job with Tomlinson's voice! He makes him sound like Jack Nicholson--very funny. Tomlinson is a strung-out hippy type, whose ramblings contain surprising bits of wisdom. A very compelling character and friend of Doc Ford.Also, highly recommended for men is "Sands of the Kalahari," by William Mulvihill, and "Cry Wolf," by Wilbur Smith. Both are up-in-the-night African adventures. Check out my reviews.The Sands of KalahariCry WolfYour comments--good or bad--are appreciated. Thanks from one adverturer to another.

I just bought this printer from Office Max a couple weeks ago, and I really like it, especially the tray that will hold half a ream of paper. I've used the built-in scanner to post book-cover pictures on Amazon, and it works great.The print cartages are not refillable, though, but I had a bad experience with refillable cartages. In my old HP printer, one of them leaked and made a huge mess. Actually, it worked out great when because I took my printer back to Office Max where I bought it three years ago and where I got the cartages filled, they gave me a $250 credit. So my new machine only cost $160.If you are doing a lot of printing, the HPL7680 is the one to get. It's a real pain to keep loading paper. Check the paper capacity if you're tempted to buy a cheaper printer.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and if you are a Mormon, I respect your open-mindedness in reading this review. I like Mormons, and even love some Mormons, whom I consider some of the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.So now for the folly of this book:I'll admit that this book has a lot of pretty illustrations, but the comparisons to the Book of Mormon are so general as to apply to any culture.Further, Sorenson is disingenuous. He writes about the Bonampak murals that "some believe the body paint my explain the different hues." "Some believe"? Dah! No anthropologist of any repute believes otherwise. By not stating this fact, Sorensen has greatly mislead the uniformed reader.For example, all you have to do is study a good reproduction of these Maya murals, you will see the discoloration within the same person's body. The beautiful green feathers of the headdresses of many figures are clearly water damaged, light green turning into dark green. The murals are 1200 years old, afterall.Here is something else Sorenson did not mention. The modern Maya so closely resemble the people depicted in the murals that they could serve as models for the murals. This remarkable fact is listed in all reputable texts on the Maya--along with pictures of Modern Maya standing by the Murals.I could go on, but I'll just note a couple other things. Maya babies are born with a blue spot at the base of their spine (also Asian babies). This "Mongolian Spot" was not mentioned by Sorenson.If you look through the book, almost all of the pictures show Maya paganism, not Book of Mormon Christianity.Also, I have been told by many Mormons that the Maya had nothing to do with the Book of Mormon--that the Book of Mormon took place somewhere else. Sorenson is reviving a long refuted idea that has been abandoned by almost all Mormon scholars.Because such books are so easily refuted (the footnotes often do not check out), writers like Sorensen do a great disservice to their own religion. Remember Milton R. Hunter's "horse" at Chichen Itza that turns out to be the damaged feather of a "jaguar-serpent." (See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon, by Hunter. Hunter's picture of this so-called "horse" was also in hardback copies of the Book of Mormon for about twenty years).Other readers will remember the many false citations in Paul R. Cheesman's book, "These Early Americans" (example, p. 65, where Cheesman says an Indian gave Pizarro an "iron hatchet." In the source listed (Helps, "The Life of Pizarro, p. 123), it says the exact opposite. Cheesman also left out the key word "Castillian" (Spanish) in referring to the animals in Mexico after the Spanish conquest. The meaning is thus changed.I'll admit that this book has a lot of pretty illustrations, but the comparisons to the Book of Mormon are so general as to apply to any culture.Here are some more things that Sorenson failed to mention:All you have to do is travel to Guatemala (as I have) and look at the actual Maya people living there today. They could be models for the people depicted on the murals and sculptures. All reputable archaeologists point this out and even have photos of modern Maya people standing next to the carvings. But this is not a fact that you will read about in books about "Book of Mormon Archaeology."Even more reprehensible is the failure of Mormon scholars to note one of the greatest achievements of the 20th Century--the decipherment of Maya writing. And guess what? It says nothing about the themes or subjects of the Book of Mormon. You'll read about "18 rabbit" but not about "Nephi."Some other things you will not read in Mormon books on archaeology are the following:1. The Maya drilled holes in their teeth and inlaid them the jade.2. They deformed the skulls of their babies to produce a cone-head shape.3. They hung small balls from strings that dangled in front of their noses to produce cross eyes.4. They gave hallucinogenic enemas to each other in their temples (some 25 hallucinogenic substances have been identified (frog glans, insects, and plants).5. Drinking and smoking (hallucinogenic plants) were an important part of their religion.6. Scarification (tattoos are shown on their upper arms and thighs).7. They filed their teeth into various shapes (often points).8. They practiced self-bloodletting (the foreskin often looked like a tassel from cutting it for blood).9. They practiced head-hunting and human sacrifice during all periods of their civilization.In trying to turn native peoples into Book of Mormon Christians, Mormon scholars have resorted to misrepresenting the state of knowledge (or condition) modern archaeology (often by omission). These scholars can't even see straight enough to note that native peoples went around half naked and their dress would surely be condemned by the Mormon Church today. The ancient carvings and paintings confirm this uncomfortable truth.Lastly, where are all those Book of Mormon cows, horses, steel swords, and chariots? Where is the writing? We have the copper scroll of the Book of Isaiah in the Bible (on display and translated in Jerusalem), but not a single Book of Mormon plate in hundreds of years of history? Come on.

First of all, this is not a movie about religion, even if the pilgrims are back-sliding Catholics. Following a path that has been traveled for a thousand years, four pilgrims hike along the Pyrenees Mountains and Basque country on an 800 km trek to the tomb of Saint James in the town of Santiago de Compostela.The movie is about finding meaning in life, even after the worst tragedies (Martin Sheen's son has died while on the pilgrimage and Martin completes it, leaving bits of his son's ashes along the way). The fact that the characters are all Catholics is really not that important. The same story could have been told about Hindus making a pilgrimage.This is a beautiful movie filled with likable characters, and it will have you hoping that they will all succeed in their quest of self-discovery and reconciling themselves to the realities of their lives.For me, at least, the ancient architecture was a reminder of what western European civilization owes Spain. In 1492, the same year that Columbus discovered the New World, Queen Isabella expelled the Moors from Spain, leaving Europe in the hands of the Christians, rather than the Muslims. Of course, it was brutal and bloody (they also expelled the Jews). But--and this is important--many Muslims and Jews simply converted to Christianity so they could stay. Had history not resolved itself in this way, the New World might have been conquered by Muslims, rather than Catholics. Now that would be a different world.

This novel is worth it for the following lines spoken by Parson Thwackum:"When I mention religion," said the parson, "I mean the Christian religion; and not only the Christian religion, but the Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant religion, but the Church of England. And when I mention honour, I mean that mode of divine grace which is not only consistent with but dependent upon this religion, and is consistent and dependent upon no other" (p. 105).Very amusing, but think of the centuries when men like that had supreme political power--then to laugh, to doubt meant to be burned alive. Michael Servetus (1511-1553) was burned alive by John Calvin for doubting the Holy Trinity and preaching Unitarianism. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) was burned for similar heresies.There is no end to the evil that men like Parson Thwackum would do if they had power. We must stand forever on guard against such views of religion.

A shorter review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book. I've just noted the general theme. ThanksInside my paperback copy of Russell Baker's book, I wrote "Great Book!"This was in 1985, and I would rank this memoir as one of the best I have ever read.From his youth in rural Virginia through the Depression in Baltimore, the very best of America shines though in this charming autobiography. I laughed till I cried at Baker's description of living above his uncle's funeral parlor. Whenever families gathered, he provided shrimp, and so whenever the young Russell smelled shrimp, he knew there was a funeral.Mrs. Baker's determination to raise a good family after her husband's death was inspiring. My own father died when I was fifteen, so I could see my mother in her--even though my story was set in the 1960s, not the 1930s.Highly recommended. I would also highly recommend the "Autobiography of Malcolm X." A very powerful account of Malcolm X's life. I do not agree with his religion, but I was inspired at how he turned away from a life of crime and made a better man of himself. In the last few years of his life, he turned away from the racism against whites that he had earlier believed.The Autobiography of Malcolm X : As Told to Alex HaleyThe Autobiography of Malcom X

Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated, and please remember that a short review (recommendation in this case) is good if it leads you to a great book.I own this edition, and I would highly recommend it.

That edition (p. 112) contains the most wonderful scene of two children and a dog running up a hill with a beautiful valley in the background. It's from the cover of the "Saturday Evening Post" of May, 1960. Done in light greens and yellows, this painting is very evocative of an innocent youthful world.I wish that painting had been larger.

Here is a book of great passion. The pathos of the last lines are stunning. They are written about a man, who step by step, became involved the Cocaine smuggling and caused the death of several innocent people. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but read the following lines."Knowledge of the facts of Bob's life and death changes nothing in the world. Our celebrating his life and grieving over his death, however, will. Good cheer and mournfulness over lives other than our own, even wholly invented lives--no, especially wholly invented lives--deprive the world as it is of some of the greed it needs to continue to be itself. Sabotage and subversion, then, are this book's objectives. Go, my book, and help destroy the world as it is."How profound! I wrote inside the cover of this powerful book the following lines: "How glad I am that I have a vision of what society should be!" Without idealism, the world is meaningless. That's what was wrong with main character in this memorable novel.

Note: Some immature Mormon is angry over my negative reviews of books written to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your comments or "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksMy review is short and to the point. In my opinion, it's better to read the longer reviews after you see the movie or read the book.I really enjoyed this book. It kept me turning the pages. A Walmart-style store moves into a small Arizona town, and gradually takes over everything, including the police (a privatized corporate force). One man, of course, begins to do battle, and tries to save his daughters, who are forced to wear skimpy outfits to work for the devilish Store.Bentley Little makes the Store into a national organization, but I kept thinking that it would have been more believable if it had been a single store.Just sit back and have fun with it (the one reviewer said it was funny, and I agree. But it was evil at the same time).If you are interested in American history, check out my reviews of Mormon books from a non-Mormon perspective.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated, and thanks for reading my short review."California Fire and Life" starts with a slow burn and really grabs you. The fascinating details of Jack Wade's career as a fire investigator pull you into the story. Some were really amazing.For example, if the indoor family pet somehow survives the fire, there is good reason to suspect arson. It is often the case in an arson-murder that the person will kill his or her spouse, but let the dog out. If the fire has more than one point of origin, then it has to be arson. If the windows are left open, that is also a telltail sign of arson (the open windows increase the draft for the fire). Therefore, if a family goes on vacation and their house burns down, the windows had better be closed.In this fast-paced story, Jack investigates the fire at a mansion. Another investigator has ruled it accidental (the wife dies while smoking in bed). I don't want to tell too much, but a bunch of little details point to an arson-murder by the husband, a man with connections to the Russian mafia.It was amazing to learn how much arson occurs after an earth-quake (its a quick way to get out of debt if the contents of the house is highly insured).The story has a lot of detail and twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages.Highly recommended.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.Although the "Burned-Over District" was published some sixty years ago, Whitney Cross' book is still essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why Mormonism would emerge in 1830.Religious revivals, like fires, swept through western New York, producing reformers, anti-drinking zealots, those who denounced "priestcraft," prophets, and saints. One man deeply influenced by the heated winds of his times was Joseph Smith."In religion," Cross writes, "optimism took the form of belief in an early millennium. Just as the American political system would lead the to equality and justice, so would American revivals inaugurate the thousand years' reign of Christ on earth before the Second Coming and the end of the world" (p. 79).Thus, we are not surprised to see the emergence around 1830 of three churches founded on millennialism--The Church of Christ (later the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the "Mormon"), the Adventists, and the Disciples of Christ. Each of these new American religions preached millennialism, opposed drinking, and wanted to return to New Testament Christianity.Much more has come to light since Cross published his book--especially about magic and the occult--but his book is still valuable. Highly recommended.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.Although this was a story that I couldn't put down, and I sped right through it, I wish I had not read it. It is so brutal, and the psycho stepmom is so awful that it will take weeks to get those images out of my mind.I gave it five stars, then deleted my review and re-posted it, giving it one star. After some criticism about being unfair to the author, I have deleted and re-posted it again. I gave it five stars for a compelling plot and excellent writing, but I still would urge you not to read it. Try something else. At least, that's the advice I wished I had been given. Before I read another Ketchum novel, I'm going to read a review.This novel should come with a major disclaimer because sexual mutilation is so warped and disturbing. Many fans of horror stories--even fans of stories full of blood and guts--avoid reading about sexual mutilation, especially involving children.Don't get me wrong. I've really enjoy many horror stories, but this one was just too dismal, too dark, and lacked an emotionally satisfying ending.I'm a big-time reader. I'm no prude, but give me some hope (like Steven King does most of the time). After I post this review, I'm going to take a shower and go on a three-day fast (I exaggerate).I think that even the author, Jack Ketchum, felt guilty about writing this story because he included an apologetic afterward explaining his motivation. That's something I don't like. If I want a review, I'll read a review. A novel should stand on its own two feet without explanation by the author.A writer should not explain his or her motivations in an afterward (that's okay, but not in the physical book, itself. Save such remarks for magazine interviews or autobiographies, or other mediums).I remember one novel where the author actually explained how he took this and that incident in the newspaper and put them together in a collage. "The girl hanging in the tree was actually an old man who was run over by a truck"--that kind of thing. By the time he got through explaining all the plot elements, he had self-destructed his own novel.To help clear my mind, here is a horror story that I would recommend. It's a creepy story, but there is hope in it."Summer of Night" (the dead are walking around in this great coming-of-age story by Dan Simmons).Summer of Night (Aspect Fantasy)And for another great coming-of-age story (this one a sweet great American novel--no horror) read "Red Sky At Morning," Richard Bradford.Red Sky at Morning: A Novel (Perennial Classics)Finally, for a five-star horror writer, try Richard Laymon--"Island," "Darkness Tell Us," "Night in Lonesome October," and "The Traveling Vampire Show," to name a few. Treat your to checking out the following links:IslandDarkness, Tell UsNight in the Lonesome OctoberThe Traveling Vampire Show

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksSet in rural Virginia during the Depression, this warm coming-of-age story of a teenager, a would-be writer, is just the thing for a cold winter's evening. It's a slice of Americana remembered with love and emotion.The famous TV series "The Waltons" is based on "Spencer's Mountain." As a reader of fifty years, I highly recommend it.If you haven't read Richard Bradford's "Red Sky At Morning," that's another highly recommended coming-of-age novel (this one set in New Mexico in the 1940s).Red Sky at Morning: A Novel (Perennial Classics)I would also highly recommend the modern cowboy story "Goldenrod," by Herbert Harker.GoldenrodAnd "Finding Caruso," by Kim Barns.Finding CarusoThese novels are a way of reliving our youth. Frank Lloyd Wright said something to the effect that: "Youth is a fact of birth, but being young is a state of mind."I hope you liked my little review and the quotation. Thanks

First of all, this is a very well-written story. Nevertheless, I didn't like it because it turned into a dirge of sadness. I like all kinds of stories--even sad stories--but I want to care about the characters; at least one of them should be sympathetic.This story may appeal to some readers, but I got tired of it. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he said, "The characters are just a bit cold, a bit flat, and uninspiring."The main couple, Henry and Sonia House, have lost their son in an accident, and neither Henry nor Sonia can deal with it (they both seem to be ignoring their eight-year-old daughter).Sonia becomes involved with Ned Weaver, a painter who has her pose nude for him, and when Henry finds out, all kinds of problems (of course) develop.At the end of the story, we learn the unhappy fates of all the main characters as they grow old.I had a hard time caring about anybody in this story. Their flaws andunrelenting sadness drove me up a wall at times.I just looked up the German word for sorrow and world sadness. It's "weltschmertzis," and there was too much of it in this novel.

I really enjoyed this novel. It kept me turning the pages. I didn't like theending, though. I guess I like stories with happier endings. That said, I wouldstill highly recommend this book. It's a well-written thriller that keeps you guessing.HOWEVER: In looking at the one-star reviews of Gardner's "The Neighbor," I saw something that really bothered me about the present book. La Boomba gave "The Neighbor" one star and wrote something about the character DD Warren that I agree with:"There have been a number of Lisa Gardner books I've enjoyed in the past. Here comes the but. She has started bringing the character of DD Warren to the forefront in her stories. I find this policewoman to be unbelievably stupid, foolish, and stubborn. She gets a first impression in her head about who has committed a crime, how it was done, etc. And she is, inevitably, wrong, wrong, wrong. It wouldn't be so bad if she showed a shred of good humor along the way, but all she does is snarl and growl through the whole bit. And she's not even gracious when she's proven wrong. Add to that her jealousy over her ex-lover's new wife and this woman is so insufferable that I have stopped buying any books in which she is a character."

I realize that not all Mormons agree with Dr. Nibley's arguments. One good Mormon said:"As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."Nibley is simply dishonest. He criticizes the theory that Joseph Smith got ideas from "View of the Hebrews." BUT--like all Mormon writers, he fails to give the full title. I'll correct that omission--"View of the Hebrews, or the Tribes of Israel in America." To me, this sounds like an idea for a novel.Further, "View of the Hebrews" is full of "parallels" to the Book of Mormon. In addition, Joseph Smith's chief scribe and third cousin--Oliver Cowdery--came from Poultney, Vermont where "View of the Hebrews" was published twice--1823 and 1825 (five years before the Book of Mormon). Nibley also forgot to mention the subtitle of "View of the Hebrews." I'll correct that oversight: "The Tribes of Israel in America."But an even more basic error is Nibley's refusal to acknowledge the reality of Joseph Smith's youth. There were multiple books available with engravings showing the Jewish high priest in ancient times. The July 7, 1824 edition of the Wayne Sentinel newspaper in Palmyra advertised some 320 books on the front page, many of them religious.Why doesn't Nibley mention such facts? Because he chose not to. Nibley's scholarship should be an embarrassment to educated Mormons.Nibley does not mention that none of the essential elements of Mormonism are in the Book of Mormon (a fairly basic Christian novel)--no planet of God, no temple marriage, no wearing of temple garments, no marriage for time and eternity, no polygamy, no men becoming gods, no baptism for the dead, and no eternal progression. In light of what followed, this is a profound contradiction between Joseph Smith's earlier and later beliefs (power changes men).Oddly--in fact, amazingly--in the Book of Mormon there is no prophesy about the establishment of a new church. Joseph Smith denounced the Catholic Church and other fallen churches, but why is there no mention of the LDS Church (there are prophecies about the discovery of America and other things BEFORE 1830, but none after. Religious errors are denounced but no prediction that a new church would be founded.Nibley spent his entire life "lying for the Lord," dishing up comfort food to educated Mormons, who did not and do not have the background the evaluate his claims. Like other books by Nibley, this one is all smoke and mirrors--a faith massage.SEE MY REVIEWS OF OTHER BOOKS BY PROFESSOR NIBLEY--"Since Cumorah," "World of the Jaredites," and "An Approach to the Book of Mormon."Some readers may find it interesting that I have seen several maps of Arabia and Africa published during Joseph Smith's youth. The African maps often show the "Cumora" Islands off the coast of Zanzibar. These islands were famous as hideouts for pirates and buried treasure (there were stories of buried pirate treasure all over New England and New York). Thus, it is likely that Joseph Smith used this hint when he concocted his story and created the name "Cumorah."Other maps show the "Cumoro" Islands, but the name is often pronounced with a soft "a" sound. In just hearing it, you might think the speaker said "Cumora."In addition: Joseph Smith's brother Hyrum was a member of the Masonic lodge of Palmyra years before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Masonic rites are full of ancient lore, and books were published with pictures (engravings) of the inside of the ancient Jewish Temple.Ask yourself: WHY DOESN'T DR. NIBLEY MENTION THESE THINGS? The answer can only be a sigh at the way of the world.Here is but one example of what was available (not that you would need this to compose the Book of Mormon). It's an expensive book today.Travels in Arabia / Comprehending an Account of Those Territories in Hedjaz Which the Mohammedans Regard as Sacred,Burckhardt , John Lewis1829, , BURCKHARDT , LUDWIG LEWIS TRAVELS ISLAM ISLAMIC ISLAMISCHE GESCHICHTE MUSULMANS MOSLEM MUSLIM ARAB ARABIC ARABIAN ARABS ARABIEN ARABER ARABISCH ARABISCHE HEDJAZ DJEDDA EGYPT EGYPTIAN &Auml;GYPTEN SYRIA SYRIAN NEAR EAST HISTORY MECCA MEKKA MEDINA BEDOUINS BEDUINS BEDUINEN ETHNOGRAPHY RELIGIONS KAABA REISEBERICHTE VOYAGE VOYAGES REISE REISEN WAHABIT WAHABI COMMERCE EXPEDITIONS EXPLORATION DJIDDA HADJ, two volumes , 8vo. , pp. 452 /431 , 5 engraved maps , complete ; polished full-calf covers with blind-stamped pattern around edges; gilt lettering/ornamentation to spines and covers ; attractively marbled endpapers and edges ; ex.Price: EUR 1850.00 (US$ 2996.78)If you have any doubts about what I am saying, do a search on "Worldcat" of books about Arabia, the ancient Hebrews. Just type in the years 1800 to 1830 and the word "Arabia" or "Hebrews." You can also check ABE Books.Mormon writers have told a lot of lies (most actually ignorant--except for FARMS) of how many books would have been available to Joseph Smith.Here's another:Sacred geography;: Or a companion to the Holy Bible.

Sorry. I had super high expectations, but I didn't like thechoppy writing style, and there were too many characters toto keep track of. I think the author needed a single characterright off the bat that I really cared about. It didn't happen.Then I went to the negative reviews and was convinced tosave my time. I bought the book for $10 at an airport (ouch!).

In addition, Joseph Smith's chief scribe and third cousin--Oliver Cowder--came from Poultney, Vermont where "View of the Hebrews" was published twice--1823 and 1825 (five years before the Book of Mormon).I always ask myself if Mormons think about what Hugh Nibley is saying? On page 18, he says that having the actual gold plates for scientists to study would be "very disruptive and it would prove nothing."Prove nothing? It would prove they really existed. What is more strange is that Nibley then fills his book with citations about actual ancient biblical writings that are in museums today, such as the copper scroll in Jerusalem containing the Book of Isaiah. Why then not a single Book of Mormon plate?Incredibly, Nibley goes on to say of the modern paper edition of the Book of Mormon that it is "a far more miraculous object than any gold plates would be." Really? Anyone who accepts this reasoning is not thinking, but such hyperbolic flights are the hallmark of Nibley's writing (see my other reviews of his books).On page 370 of Nibley's book, he writes that, "In the Nephites we have a small and mobile population, living in quickly-built wooden cities, their most ambitious structures being fortifications of earth and timbers occasionally reinforced with stones."Doesn't the Book of Mormon mention some 38 cities by name? Doesn't the Book of Mormon say that the Nephites built a temple "like unto Solomons?" They were also settled enough to have a money system. So what Nibley is saying doesn't even apply to the claims of the Book of Mormon.When you think about the phrase "quickly-built wooden cities," it is quite humorous. Nibley is trying to make them quickly disappearing! But such ruins (including garbage heaps) are a heaven for archaeologists.Also, in several places, Nibley misquotes and misrepresents his sources. On page 371, for example, he says that "English archaeologists are always confusing Neolithic, British, Roman, Saxon, and Norman ruins."His source (Curwen, Neolithic Camps) says, "It is extremely difficult to eradicate erroneous popular beliefs." His other source (Crawford, "Barrows") says "Castle Mounds are often mistaken for barrows." In other words, it is not "English archaeologists," but the public that mistakes these ruins. Another of Nibley's sources ("Prehistoric Fortifications in Bavaria," by Wagner) says that extensive study has "enabled us to distinguish between Pre-Roman, Roman, and post-Roman remains." Nibley was simply telling lies.Also, all these scholars give long lists of what was found in these ruins. Having used archaeology when it suited him, Nibley ends his book with an attack on archaeology. His section headings are a confession that he has failed to prove anything. They include "Limitations of Archaeology," "A Disappointing Picture," and incredibly the "Scarcity of Stone." Nibley should have taken one of the highly advertised "Book of Mormon Lands" tours and see all the stone ruins of the ancient world.What Nibley is doing is rattling on and speaking without authority on the subject, desperately trying to account for the lack of archaeological evidence in support of the Book of Mormon. He also uses a lot of emotional hyperbole. On a single page (p. 23), for example, Nibley uses the following phrases--"remarkable vindication," "striking hints," "odd coincidences," "astonishing parallels," and "perfectly familiar." To the educated but uniformed reader, it sounds like something has been proved.Nibley was a master at word games (pages 232-233). He takes a word, or the root of a word, then traces it back to the beginning of time--but carefully ignoring the Bible. There is no method to this false reasoning. Nibley allows himself to choose words here and there over thousands of years out of dozens of cultures.Anything, of course, can be proved with such a method, including that the novel "Manuscript Found" is an ancient document. Spaulding's novel is full of words that could be traced back thousands of years. Nibley, of course, does not note this fact.Here is another bogus claim by Dr. Nibley--see "Since Cumorah" (page 171):"We have discussed elsewhere the surprising presence in the pages of the Book of Mormon of a full-blown Qasida or primitive desert poem, recited under exactly the proper circumstances and in exactly the proper form by Father Lehi."Nibley's reference is to his own book, "An Approach to the Book of Mormon" (page 225-228).Nibley is just engaging in hyperbole. His hyperventilating of the content of a couple verses in First Nephi does not justify such statements--a "full-blown Qasida." Please. Give your readers a break.Here are the lines (and he only gives one example) that Nibley quotes from the Book of Mormon:"O that thou mightiest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast.And immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!"Then Nibley lists his version of the elements of a Qasida. Note his first item.A song inspired by the sight of water gushing from a spring or running down a valley. So that's how Nibley gets "water" into the Book of Mormon lines. He can't find the word "water," so he plays with "valley" to fit his rule for a "full-blown Qasida."If Nibley's readers would slow down and not be intimidated by such words as "Qasida," they would soon begin to see all kinds of flaws in his logic.And again, note that there is no "water" in the one Book of Mormon example that he quotes! Nibley is simply doing is throwing around scholarly terms that are not justified by his citation. His purpose is to make educated Mormons feel good about subjects that they know little about. Such "scholarship" is something that Mormons, themselves, should denounce, rather than waiting for outsiders to do it.Another example appears on page 233. Nibley takes the name "Korihor" in the Book of Mormon and notes all kinds of connections with the ancient past, but he does not even mention the similar names in the Bible--"Kohath," "Korah," and "Korahite."Linquistic Acrobatics!And what about the roots of those words? Nibley says nothing about them. Robert Wauchope in "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians" called such word games "linguistic acrobatics."

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. I also want you to know that I don't think the LDS Church is a cult; nor do I believe that Mormons worship the devil.

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.Many decades ago, I wrote in the front of my paperback copy of this novel "A Great Story--very tender!"Set in Florida in the early 1940s, this novel follows the adventures of Terry Calder, a schoolboy who is on the run from truant officers. He roams the Everglades and meets an old man. McCree, who has lived outside the law for decades, teaches Terry much about life during the hot summer.Another highly recommended book: Richard Bradford's "Red Sky At Morning" is a wonderful coming-of-age novel set in New Mexico in the 1940s.Red Sky at Morning: A Novel (Perennial Classics)I would also highly recommend the modern cowboy story "Golden Rod," by Herbert HarkerGoldenrodThese novels are a way of reliving our youth. Frank Lloyd Wright said something to the effect that: "Youth is a fact of birth, but being young is a state of mind."I hope you liked my little review. I think long reviews are better after you read a novel. I don't like knowing too much before I read a story. Thanks

"Into the Fire" is a compelling ride that doesn't stop until the end.My only qualifier is that if you can't stand explicit sex, don't read Laymon.I won't give any spoilers by repeating what's in the first chapters. Rodneyis a psychopath with a crush on Pamela, a woman he knew from high school.Rodney (and Laymon makes you hate him) murders Pamela's husband, and rapes and kidnapsPamela.She is handcuffed, and out in the desert, she has to relieve herself.When Rodney takes off her cuffs, she scratches out one of his eyes and escapes.Rodney chases Pamela, and she gets away. Then she looks back and sees Rodney (I lovethat name!) lying face down in the desert. What does Pamela do? NO, DON'T! She goes backto get Rodney's car keys out of his pocket. Of course!Rodney jumps up and then...I won't tell anymore, except to say that Pamela wakes up in a bus full ofmanikins as passengers, and driven by a good guy (of sorts).We are only to about page 30, and now it getsinteresting--you can't put the book down because of the well-developedcharacters. Compulsive! A page turner!Here are some other five-star books by Richard Laymon that I highly recommend."Island."Island"The Traveling Vampire Show."The Traveling Vampire Show"Night in Lonesome October."Night in the Lonesome October

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksLike Sagan's "Dragons of Eden," "Broca's Brain" is great food for thought. And with masterful writing. Consider these lines, and I hope they lead you to read this wonderful book."But those with a set of beliefs they profess to feel deeply about, which they have selected without an unbiased sifting through the facts and the alternatives, will feel uncomfortably challenged by searching questions. Anger at queries about our beliefs is the body's warning signal: here lies unexamined and probably dangerous doctrinal baggage."The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human IntelligenceI would recommend another book--this one full of quotations and beautiful engravings to fit the quotations.

Note: There are a couple Mormons who are angry over my negative reviews of books written in defense of the Book of Mormon, and they have been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks.I can't comment on every picture, but this book is worth the price for only three of the images: the "Apotheosis of Technology" (showing the future with an obelisk, spaceships, and a huge planet in the background), "Interplanetary Excursions" (showing elephant-like creatures hauling people from a spaceship in a river onto land), and a couple of neat pictures of Jane Fonda as "Barbarella." If you don't like Jane Fonda, don't worry. The rest of the book is great.You'll find something in this book that you'll love. See my postings of these pictures.

Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.I must have really burned him or her because I've deleted this review and re-posted it and within an hour, I had a "not helpful" vote. Give me a break. That person's faith must be very fragile, indeed. Oh, well.I'm trying to be "helpful," so your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and I hope you find some enjoyable lines (below). Thanks.This collection has many of the poems we all love. It's not an exhaustive collection, but it's worth buying for Quigly's introductory essay, and as she said, "Shelley lives on outside his verse, and continues still to attract or repel, as he did when he was alive." How true.In "Astor; or the Spirit of Solitude," Shelley left a perfect, though probably unintended,description of himself."The brave, the gentle, and the beautiful,The child of grace and genius."And of our place in history, it gives us pause to read Shelley's "Ozymandias."I met a traveler from an antique landWho said; Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. Near them, on the and,Half sunk, a shattered visages lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:And on the pedestal these words appear:'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bareThat lone and level sands stretch far away.And I must quote a few lines from the "Skylark."Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!Bird thou never wert,That from Heaven, or near it,Purest thy full heartIn profuse strains of unpremeditated art....What thou art we know not;What is most like thee?From rainbow clouds there flow notDrops so bright to seeAs from thy presence showers a rain of melody.Also, check out the engravings opposite some of Shelley's poems in "A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought," by David Allen Williams. I've scanned two pages (in my picture section), and I would highly recommend this book to any poetry lover.It's full of rare engravings opposite selections of poetry and verse. A lost classic worth checking out (below).A Celebration of Humanism and FreethoughtA Celebration of Humanism and Freethought

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksA very short review is not necessarily a bad review. So here it goes:This remarkable little book has probably been missed by many readers interested in the Book of Mormon. Irving Litvag says nothing about the Book of Mormon, but in detailing Mrs. Pearl Curran's authorship (under the spell of a spirit named Patience Worth) of thousands of pages of fiction, one can see how anyone under the right conditions could write a novel.Between 1913 and 1937, Curran, a relatively uneducated St. Louis housewife, began dictating seven full-length novels, thousands of poems, innumerable epigrams and aphorisms, and thousands of pages of other material (some four million words in all).Curran, as the spirit of a seventeenth century English woman, wrote in "a strange yet beautiful language strewn with obsolete and archaic words." Her works drew the attention of literary critics and historians. One critic said her story about Jesus was "the greatest story of the life and times of Christ penned since the Gospels were finished."Litvag's book illustrates how a relatively uneducated person with a mission and a scribe could grind out historical fiction, such as Joseph Smith did with the Book of Mormon.Check out my one-star review of "By the Hand of Mormon," by Terryl Givens and my one-star reviews of Hugh Nibley's books. Click on the following links, then scroll down to my reviews.By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World ReligionSince Cumorah (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 7)Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.PS: Check Edwin Firmage comments. An active Mormon even as an adult, Firmage came to the following conclusion:Professor Edwin Firmage, Jr. writes:"Nearly twenty years ago, as a first year-graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, my ambition was to become another Hugh Nibley, whose writings I loved since I was twelve....""Still a neophyte, but armed with German and a little Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew, and intent on acquiring the requisite apologetic tools, I cameo Berkeley to study ancient Near Eastern languages, particularly Egyptian, the language of mysteries par excellence."Not long after my arrival, I was asked to teach the Book of Mormon in the Gospel Doctrine class in my Berkeley ward. I welcomed the opportunity, as it would give me a chance to delve deeper into the book. By any standard, my wife and I were faithful Mormons who attended church, visited the temple, and prayed together. I expected my study of the Book of Mormon to result in an increase of faith as it had done on my mission. But within six months, I no longer believed the Book of Mormon to be an ancient text."To this day, I am not sure how it happened, although I can isolate several issues that played a role in my change of mind....I have often thought that what happened to me in Berkeley was fundamentally a conversion, or, if you like, an anti-conversion. The process had all the inscrutable suddenness that characterized some of the conversions I had witnessed as missionary. Like a conversion to faith, the effect of my change of mind propagated with amazing speed. Almost overnight my whole outlook on life was different.""The remaining pages of this essay will present a few of what, for me in 1984, were discoveries of some importance. These do not by any means constitute a comprehensive explanation of the Book of Mormon. Nor are they offered as proof of my thesis that the book is modern, but as examples of how the assumption that is modern resolves otherwise significant difficulties."From an essay in the "American Apocrypha."

Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my negative reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksIn this novel, Doc Ford is up to more adventures and a lifestyle that appeals to men. I mean, he's not married, he lives in the stilt house in Florida, has a lot of friends (some quirky like Tomlinson, a wonderful character), and he has a lot of lady friends. Doc Ford's background is mirky, a lot of it spent on secret missions for a CIA type of organization.The average man will get lost in most of White's novels, sailing away with him on some grand adventure.I've enjoyed all of Randy Wayne White's novels. If you're not in the mood to read, then get them on CD. Ron McLarty does a super job with Tomlinson's voice! He makes him sound like Jack Nicholson--very funny. Tomlinson is a strung-out hippy type, whose ramblings contain surprising bits of wisdom. A very compelling character and friend of Doc Ford.

Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a good story."Thunderhead" is a great adventure set in the wilds of southern Utah. Some anthropologists have a map and set out to find a lost Anasazi city. The bad guy was not as believable as I would have liked, but set that aside and get lost in this wonderful adventure.I would also recommend, "Tyrannasaur Canyon," a new novel set in the same area.

Note: I made some Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.Your "helpful" vote is greatly appreciated. ThanksIf you love words and their clever use, you will love this book. Dr. Grothe even has a website for new examples of chiasmus (two or more lines that follow a parallel structure). Here is a fine example of chiasmus.The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge answered one of his critics with the following chiasmus:"I will concede your general rule that every poet is a fool.But as your book serves to show it, not every fool is a poet."I have to repeat the example of one Amazon reviewer, who quoted this line about the Hemingway centennial:"Only in the case of Hemingway could the century of the writer be more celebrated than the most celebrated writer of this century."An historical note!Mormons have claimed to have found chiastic sentence structures in the Book of Mormon (1830), claiming also that chiasmus was unknown in Joseph Smith's day. The truth is that the chiastic structures found in the Bible were well-known to Bible readers--one book containing examples of parallelisms in "Hebrew poetry" was even advertised on the front page of Joseph Smith's hometown of Palmyra New York (Thomas Hartwell Horne, "An Introduction to the Knowledge and Critical Study of the Holy Scriptures").The other fact is that Joseph Smith probably did not intentionally produce any chiastic sentence structures as he dictated the Book of Mormon to his scribe, who sat behind a curtain unable to see the gold plates.Chiastic structures are found in the introduction to the Book of Mormon (admittedly written by Joseph Smith, and in his other writings). Joseph Smith was so repetitious that these unintentional structures are occasionally found (Mormons also delete elements that don't fit in their search for things that "Joseph Smith could not have known").See my review of "Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon."Echoes and Evidences of the Book of Mormon

They don't want you to read Coe's book, and for good reason.So your "helpful" votes are appreciated.It is astonishing how little known one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century is! If asked to list the ten most important achievements of the 20th century, most people would not know that one of them was the decipherment of Maya writing.The decipherment of Maya writing was help up by religious and political prejudice. A Russian man in the height of the cold war held the key. "Dr. Yuri Valentinovich Knorosov, the man who, against all odds, has made possible the modern decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing."The great Maya scholar Dr. J. Eric S. Thompson simply could not see the forest for the trees. He was so fixated on the peaceful-kingdom illusion of ancient Maya society that he dismissed the "Marxist-Leninist" approach.Thompson should not have worried about communists so much and concentrated on what they were saying. Tatiana Proskouriakoff was another Russian who played a crucial role in the decipherment of Maya writing.Coe's book should be on the bookshelf of anyone interested in the Maya.Oddly, Mormon writers who have so many pictures of Maya ruins in their books seldom mention the decipherment of Maya writing. Can it be that it says nothing about the themes and subject matter of the Book of Mormon? This is a very curious omission.See my one-star reviews of Mormon books.

"This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).The ancient Maya civilization, Sharer continues, "are to be `explained' not as a product of transplanted Old World civilization, but as the result of the processes that underlie the growth of any culture, including those that develop the kind of complexity we call civilization.""The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters."

I enjoyed "A Fine and Private Place" and read it right through. It takes a talented writer to create a world in an unlikely place. Here we have a vast cemetery, and in the forgotten overgrown area, a man lives in a mausoleum. For twenty years, he has never left the cemetery. His food is brought to him by a talking raven, and he visits with ghosts, who can only be seen by him.The ghosts don't last long but disappear after about a month, going to who knows where. The book concerns the relationship the man has with two ghosts and a woman visitor to the cemetery. The two ghosts fall in love, but I don't want to reveal anything else. The love story worked, as well as the ponderings about life, death, and love.For some reason, this novel drew me in. I've been into ghost stories lately. Another unusual ghost story that I just reviewed is "A Certain Slant of Light," by Laura Whitcomb. It was easy to get lost in these stories, where the ghosts weren't scary, but interesting.Check out: "A Certain Slant of Light," by Laura Whitcomb.A Certain Slant of Light

Note: Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and if you are a Mormon, I respect your open-mindedness in reading this review. I like Mormons, and even love some Mormons, whom I consider some of the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.So now for the folly of this book:I'll limit myself to some comments on two of the articles in this book. First, John L. Sorenson's "How Could Joseph Smith Write So Accurately about Ancient American Civilization?"Sorenson has one picture of a Maya figurine of a drunken man (this is "evidence"?). Sorenson fails the mention that Maya writing has been deciphered and says nothing about the themes or subject matter of the Book of Mormon. A scholar who talks about the Maya must in fairness mention this fact. Sorenson does not.Further, the very title of Sorenson's article is an illusion--an assumption not supported by the facts.Robert J. Sharer is Professor of Anthropology and Curator of the American Section of the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. In "The Ancient Maya," Sharer analyzes the Maya from every angle. Although Sharer does not mention the Book of Mormon, he does give a devastating answer to those who would link Meso-American civilization with the ancient Hebrews, placing such theories squarely in the 19th century.For example, Sharer writes: "After more than a century of gathering and analyzing archaeological evidence, we have discovered nothing to support the idea of intervention by people from the Old World." "This is not to say that accidental contacts between the Old and New World peoples could not have occurred before the age of European exploration" (p. 6)."The idea, which either explicitly or implicitly asserts that the peoples of the New World were incapable of shaping their own destiny or developing sophisticated cultures independently of Old World influence, is still popular in quarters." "But this is but one more popular myth devoid of fact, for the evidence points unmistakably toward the evolution of civilization in the New World independently of developments in the Old World.""On the basis of the available evidence, then, the courses of cultural development in the New and Old Worlds seem clearly independent of each other and devoid of significant contact until 1492" (intro., p. 7).Speaking of Humboldt's "Researches," Sorenson says "the chance is vanishingly small that the learned German's esoteric work would have been accessible anywhere in America except at a handful of the best libraries on the Atlantic seaboard, to which Joseph had no access before the Book of Mormon was published" (1830).This confident, scholarly statement is completely false.First, Alexander Humboldt was not an "esoteric" writer; rather, he was one of the most celebrated scholars (and explorers) of his age. Further, I own the book that Mr. Sorenson is referring to, and it is not "esoteric" but written for the general reader. Humboldt visited Thomas Jefferson, and they went to Philadelphia to see the "ninth wonder of the world," the first reconstructed mammoth in about 1805.Second, Humboldt's "History of New Spain" was advertised for sale in Palmyra on the front page of the newspaper (Palmyra Register, October 6, 1818). Thus, it is highly likely that his other book was also advertised in the incomplete issues of that newspaper.Every week, long lists of books appeared in the newspapers. The farmers were better informed about the classics than the people living in the area today.Third, the Smith's subscribed to the newspaper, and they only lived two level miles from the Grandin Book Store. Earlier they lived on Palmyra's Main Street. Joseph's father had been a school teacher, and Joseph's brother Hyrum was on the Manchester School Board. The Smith's could have had any book they wanted. Seventy percent of the books sold in the US were published in England and the book trade (both ways) was great--$2.5 million dollars for around 1820 (Joseph was 15 then).---------------------Another re-writer of history in "Echoes and Evidences" is Donald W. Parry. Parry draws his reader's attention to a commentary written in 1898--seventy years after the Book of Mormon. This helped him ignore texts on Hebrew poetry published in 1817 and 1823, when Joseph Smith came of age.But in a most cynical concession to his conscience, Parry cited Lowth's book on parallelisms in a footnote at the back of his article. However (!) the citation was to an edition published in 1787, trying to keep the book as far from Joseph Smith as possible. This sort of thing is reprehensible in anyone, especially those who pose as "scholars."Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Please check my reviews of Robert Wauchope's little book, "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians." Also, check: "The Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth," by Robert Silverberg. These two books are excellent.Click here: Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method In the Study of American IndiansFor the "Mound Builders: the Archaeology of a Myth," click here: Mound Builders of Ancient America: The Archaelogy of a MythFinally, as for Dr. Hugh Nibley, here is what one good Mormon said."As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."

ThanksPilbeam's book is worth the read for the following poem by William Wordsworth, who so accurately described the world of the macabre that includes waxworks. Here is a country fair:The Horse of knowledge and the Learned Pig,The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl,The Bust that speaks and moves its gooling eyes,The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craftOf modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet showsAll out-o'-the way, far-fetched, perverted things.It is surprising that a number of the practicianer's of wax art were women. Mrs. Patience Wright (1725-86), a wax expert, toured America until her show was destroyed by fire. Then she moved to England, and finally to France. In 1781 "she failed to persuade Benjamin Franklin to help her set up a wax exhibition. He apparently told her there was too much competition."Highly recommended history of a strange art form.

Oh, well.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and note that even Mormons should read this book.Robert Silverberg tells the fascinating history of the rise and fall of the myth of the Mound Builders in a massively-researched book. Not many people know, for example, that the myth of the Mound Builders was finally laid to rest by the work of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1870s and 1880s under the direction of John Wesley Powell, the Civil War hero and one-armed explorer of the Colorado River (note "Lake Powell).By 1800, the mystery of the tens of thousands of mounds in the eastern United States called out for a solution, and that solution was not to be found in the Native Americans, who were considered too lazy to have constructed such great works. The mounds had to have been the work of some superior lost white race--notably the ancient Hebrews, but also others.Prejudice was so strong that few, if any, scholars believed that the Indians, themselves, constructed the mounds (the view from our time). The logic of racial superiority, national pride, religion, and the pocketbook demanded a history in which the Indians killed off an ancient white race of "Mound Builders."A vast continent lay at the feet of a young nation, and the only thing obstacle to its settlement were the Indians. Silverberg writes with brilliance and humor: "The dream of a lost prehistoric race in the American heartland was profoundly satisfying; and if the vanished ones had been giants, or white men, or Israelites, or Danes, or Toltecs, or giant white Jewish Toltec Vikings, so much the better."Silverberg sees both "Manuscript Found" (1816) and the Book of Mormon (1830) as expressions of the Mound Builder myth. In about 1816, the Reverend Solomon Spaulding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. A narrator in the story claimed to have found 28 parchment scrolls, which he translated. The scrolls tell the story of a shipload of Roman Christians who are blown across the ocean to America. Once here they meet the fair-skinned race of Mound Builders.That civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has "epistles"), "Censors" are the rulers ("Judges" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands. The mound builders also have horses and "mamoons" (mammoths).The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). The white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher ("Bosaka" in "Manuscript Found" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In a last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Silverberg is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. "Neutral observers," he writes, "generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding" (p. 96).Silverberg continues this compelling history by showing that the Mound Builder myth continued independently of its expression in the Book of Mormon (1830). By 1839, the vastly popular play "Behemoth" had audiences transfixed with its portrayal of "Behemoth," rogue mastodon who destroyed the mound builders. Whole armies attack Behemoth, and even forts were of no protection against the raging mastodon!During the early 1800s, copper Indian ornaments (described as "plates") were found in the mounds, and some of these ornaments were even mistaken for parts of swords. From such errors, the mound builders were soon thought to have had iron and steel. And so the myth grew (Thomas Jefferson was among the few who thought that the Indians themselves constructed the mounds).Read this book if you would like some perspective on why a book like the Book of Mormon would emerge during the early 1800s. It is a brilliant unraveling of a forgotten part of American history.See my negative, one-star reviews of books by Mormon authors: "Echoes and Evidences," "By the Hand of Mormon," "Lehi in the Deseret," and others.

And so the myth grew (Thomas Jefferson was among the few who thought that the Indians themselves constructed the mounds).Read this book if you would like some perspective on why a book like the Book of Mormon would emerge during the early 1800s. It is a brilliant unraveling of a forgotten part of American history.See my negative, one-star reviews of books by Mormon authors: "Echoes and Evidences," "By the Hand of Mormon," "Lehi in the Deseret," and others.

I bought the latest edition of this book. It has a great hologram on the cover that changes from the skull of a T-Rex to the actual monster. Nevertheless, the book's 256 pages are covered with amazing drawings of the weird "Ancestors of the Dinosaurs."Anyone who doesn't believe in evolution after thumbing this book has lost all sense of reason. Did these animals all disappear, and then God created a whole new world of dinosaurs? No, the chaos of creationism cannot account for such diversity, nor can it link these vanished worlds to each other and the present. Only evolution can do that. Further, the illustrations show how these animals are linked together.The book is full of masterful drawings that compare these strange dinosaurs with the size of a man (gray figure next to them). Each dinosaur is also described in short easy-to-read headings.I've already thumbed through it a dozen times. A must for anyone interested in dinosaurs.

I had a hard time deciding what to rate this novel. I loved "The Store," by Bentley Little. In that book, a Wallmart-style store takes over a small Arizona town. Pretty soon the town has a private police force and adult sexual products are being sold on the toy aisle."The Policy" does the same thing with insurance, creating a demon insurance company that sells policies for every imaginable contingency. "Employment Insurance" against being fired or cut back? No problem. Your boss might die in an accident, but you'll keep your job.Bentley Little creates characters that you care about, and that keeps you turning pages. The main character has just gotten a divorce and leaves the rat-race of Los Angeles for his hometown of Tuscon, Arizona. Trying to save money, he moves into a house in the lower part of town, and soon somebody throws a rock through his car window. Then an insurance agent shows up selling protection.I won't tell the whole plot, but the man meets the love of his life. The couple and their friends buy various evil insurance policies.Now for my criticism of Bentley Little. He has a great plot, but he goes too far--way over the top with the incidences (he has a baby castrated by an evil doctor because the couple didn't buy maternity insurance). This incident and a few others could have been edited out. They really don't add anything to the story, or make it more scary. They actually distract from the plot involving an evil insurance company.Also, Little made the company into a vast ancient organization. The story would have been better had the demons just appeared in the town. I had the same complaint about "The Store." Rather than being a national chain, the store should have been confined to the town.What you're reading in "The Store" and in "The Policy" is an outrageous--and true--farce and satire against WallMart and the insurance industry. Mr. Little makes a powerful case for universal health care, and I already believed that health insurance companies are criminal enterprises. We need to stop their war against the middle class, and I hope and pray that Obama does something about it.I commented on the health-care issue because that very issue is part of Mr. Little's story.So, I would just sit back and enjoy the novel. Parts of it are outrageous, but put those out of your mind. It's an entertaining read.Of the three Bentley Little novels that I have read, I would rank them as follows: "Dispatch" (I loved it. A boy starts getting free coupons by writing complaint letters to various companies), "The Store," and "The Policy."Will I read some others? Yes.

This novel has an intreging premise. Two brothers survive the collapse of the World Trade Center, steal some money, and flee to an island. Then the daughter of one of the men gets a strange phone call and realizes that her father is still alive. She steals a sailing boat and sails across the Pacific to "Blind Man's Island."I loved all this! What a great beginning. BUT!I got past the fact that one brother had a green eye and a blue eye. Talk about distracting from the focus of the story. But when that man got stabbed in the eye at "Blind Man's Island," that was too much. Come on. This is not a supernatural story.He's making love to the wife of the owner of the island, and she tells him to close his eyes as she rides him. Then she stabs him in the green eye. If they wanted to kill him, why did they do that--trying to get the reader to flinch. So recently being blinded in one eye, he hides out from the bad guys. Please...this eye business destroyed the novel for me.Leave out those two things, and I could have finished and enjoyed this novel. I would have given it 4 stars.

Once you get into the "Alarms," you can't stop reading. That's why I gave it a five. It's not up there with "In the Dark" or"The Traveling Vampire Show," but it is pure Laymon with a great twist at the end. I recommend "Alarms," and I've read a lot of Laymon's books. Much better than "Alarms" is "Into the Fire.""Into the Fire":Into the Fire

Note: I made some immature reader angry over my negative reviews of books out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as I post them.A short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a good book.Your "helpful" votes are appreciated. ThanksI'm not an art critic, but I love this book. There are several illustrations that I return to again and again. Here are a few of them:"Leaving Southfield," by Ben Prins. It shows a cop giving a man a ticket next to a sign that reads, "Southfield, the Friendly City."The cover illustration for "The American Weekly," 1951, by E. Everett Henry. It shows some children playing by the road on a beautiful fall day. Highly evocative of idealized Americana.The Coca-Cola advertising illustration, 1922, by Irving Nurick. It shows a young woman sitting in a hammock at night. Intriguing."The Art Director," by Robert Fawcett, 1951. This funny illustration shows a cynical-faced boss looking at a painting done by a company employee. He's not impressed.There are too many great illustrations to list, but I'll note one final illustration as one of my favorites. It's James Bingham's illustration of the Perry Mason story for the Saturday Evening Post, 1958. It shows a man in a trench coat at the top of a curved set of stairs. He's saying good night to a woman. The purples, blues, and yellows are super.If you like black-and-white illustrations, check out "A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought," by David Allen Williams. It's full of rare 19th century engravings opposite selections of poetry and prose. Even non-humanists will enjoy this book (One shows a preacher pointing to a Bible as he argues with an angel from God. Another shows a man beating a winged horse).See:A Celebration of Humanism and Freethought

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. I also want you to know that I don't believe the LDS Church is a cult; nor do I believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the Mormons I have known were the finest people who ever walked in shoe leather, as my grandmother used to say.Here is what one good Mormon said about one of Nibley's books."As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."Note: It is not the end of the world or the end of your religion to admit such things. In fact, by denying them and defending Nibley, Mormons invite ridicule. Why do that?Now for specifics. If you think this is a good book, then don't check out Nibley's sources or you will be sorely disappointed. I'll provide some abused sources found in just two pages (pages 212-213) of Nibley's book. In the following, Nibley is trying to justify Book of Mormon statements about the Jaredites having steel swords and glass windows in 2000 BC. Remember all of the following mistatements are found in a mere two pages of Nibley's book.1. Nibley uses an article by Wainwright about the "Coming of Iron." In speaking of an artifact from Egypt as being "steel," Nibley says "the tanslation is not absolutely certain..." Wainwright says "the translation is entirely guesswork." These descriptions are not equivalent. Also Wainwright says the use of iron before 1500 BC was extremely rare. On page 122, Nibley carelessly (and deliberately) uses the word "steel" in place of "iron" in his use of Wainwright's essay.2. Nibley quotes Vernadsky on the "History of Ancient Russia," but before his quotation about clans of iron workers, Nibley puts in his own bizarre theory that steel was "used in one place and forbidden in another." Nibley makes it sound like his source supports that screwball "forbidden" theory. Vernadsky (see page 43) does not.3. Nibley quotes from an article by D. B. Harden about ancient glass, but fails to mention that Harden says that glass in ancient times was as valuable gold and rubies. According to the article, colorless glass was not made until the 2nd century AD. Nibley ignored the sense of Harden's article in trying to get not just glass beads, but clear glass windows into 2000 BC.4. Nibley says steel "objects" were found at Darmesteter. His source says "one object" was found. Then Nibley speaks of the "correct chemical formula" for steel. This is misleading because an "analysis" is not a "formula." In other words, steel can be make accidentally by the addition of carbon to iron. Nibley twice uses "formula" in place of "analysis."5. Nibley says that "steel comes before iron in the four ages of Zarathustra." That is true, but these religious ages are listed by moral "value," not as indicating actual history. There are "gold" and "silver" ages, for example. Also Zarathustra dates from 600 BC, not 2000 BC. Nibley goes on to talk about "the Seljuk dynasty of Iran" without saying that he is talking about 1071 AD.6. Nibley mentions an ancient steel "bow" without noting that a "steel bow" is found in the Bible in II Samuel. Any honest discussion of the Book of Mormon steel bow should also mention II Samuel.On these two pages, Nibley gives the reader a snowstorm of facts and falsehoods that feel good, but prove nothing about Jaredite windows and steel swords.If you take all these references and sources, and there are many more in Nibley's book, you have a line of argument that only impresses the uninformed, or the reader who doesn't bother to actually check Nibley's sources.In a chapter about the Jaredites, for example, Nibley goes on about ancient steel and glass windows, but makes no attempt to justify the existence of the wooden (!) Jaredite submarines of 2000 BC (344 days in the ocean). Windows and steel weapons are a minor issue compared to the issue of submarines in 2000 BC, which Nibley completely ignores.Nibley's work is not scholarly, but simply emotional, religious propaganda. He says that critics believe that Joseph Smith was an "ignorant rustic who could hardly write his name" (page 128).This is simply false. Joseph Smith was an admitted Bible reader from age twelve. He also claimed to have read and translated the gold plates. His father had been a school teacher, and his brother Hyrum was on the Manchester school board. His mother was proud that all her children could read and write (though Joseph's handwriting was not the best). The Smiths even took the local newspaper.Nibley is, in fact, insulting the prophet by making him so stupid he could not compose the Book of Mormon. There has got to be a better defense of the Book of Mormon than that. The informed reader of Nibley's books will come to the conclusion that he "doth protest too much."I can't end without this quote from page 153 of Nibley's book. "The only weapons that have survived from prehistoric times are far more suited to their purpose than a modern rifle. The deadliest of all hunting weapons remains to this day the stone-headed (not steel-headed arrow)." Parenthesis by Nibley. Modern rifle and bow hunters raise your hand if you believe this! Nibley's weird theories should be an embarrassment to educated Mormons.Needless to say, a person who has a lot of footnotes in his or her book is not necessarily a scholar. As the modern historian Will Durant said: "The cleverest defenders of a faith are its greatest enemies because their subtleties engender doubt and stimulate the mind." No sentence could apply more perfectly to Hugh Nibley.Added example of a misrepresented source:In "Since Cumorah" (pages 62-63), Nibley writes about the ancient copper scroll containing the Book of Isaiah."The business of writing on such plates was hard and distasteful work....Writing on plates requires a cramped and abbreviated script, Moroni explains...and Allegro also notes the writing on copper plates actually produces a new kind of writing that is particularly difficult to read, characterized by mixing forms of letters, ignoring the proper spacing between words, "running-over from one line to the next in the middle of a word," and general neglect of the vowels."A greater deficiency lies in ourselves," Allegro concludes, "we simply do not possess a sufficiently comprehensive technical Hebrew vocabulary to deal with a text of this kind." This should have a sobering effect on those people who fondly suppose the if we could only discover some Nephite plates, the translation could be left to them: this sort of things needs an Urim and Thummin, indeed."Now, read the following and ask yourself if Nibley was honest with his source?His source is "The Treasure of the Copper Scroll," by John Marco Allegro (an expert).A. Allegro says that the scroll is in Hebrew and readable (though with some overlapping of words, pp. 27-28). In fact, Allegro provided a facsimile of the entire scroll. On one page is the scroll, and the opposite page is Hebrew writing with the English translation next to it. ALLEGRO DOES NOT SAY THAT WRITING ON PLATES PRODUCES A NEW KIND OF WRITING. In fact, he says, "A comparable fault in modern uneducated writing might be the mixing of small and capital letters, although there the diffence would not be so marked as, for instance, when our scribe writs a cursive `aleph" for the normal square-shaped. (letter).B. FACT: The copper scroll was translated by normal means by people who were experts in Hebrew.C. Allegro writes (following Nibley's selected quotes) that: "Happily in our scroll there are no true verbs, where alone vowelling might make a crucial difference to the interpretation. Whilst, therefore, we need not be unduly concerned about the lack of vowel signs in our text...Again, once aware of this failing (or device) on the part of our scribe, we can still recognize the word for what it is. A greater deficiency lies in ourselves....(Note, this sentence quoted by Nibley. He ignored what preceded it).D. Nibley has implied that an Urim and Thummin would be needed to translate the scroll, and he has totally distorted the sense of what Allegro was saying.It is also worth noting that if what Nibley says is true about a "cramped and abbreviated style of writing," then it is highly unlikely that any chiastic structures would survive a translation. (Mormon writers claim that "chiasmus"--parallel sentences are in the Book of Mormon as a result of such practices in ancient times. They carefully delete words, however, to produce these examples of chiasmus).Please check my reviews of other books by Hugh Nibley.

If you are a Mormon, I want you to know that I respect your open mindedness in reading my review. I also want you to know that I don't think the LDS Church is a cult; nor do I believe that Mormons worship the devil. Some of the finest people I have ever known have been Mormons.Also, I realize that not all Mormons agree with Dr. Nibley's arguments. One good Mormon said:"As a believing Mormon, I think that Mormons need to be willing to accept many significant limitations to Hugh Nibley's work. The plain fact is, much of it simply does not hold up to fair scholarly criticism. It would appear that Carrier has invested a great deal of effort on this issue, and that his comments are generally legitimate."As for my views, I always ask myself if Mormons think about what Hugh Nibley is saying? On page 18, he says that having the actual gold plates for scientists to study would be "very disruptive and it would prove nothing."Prove nothing? It would prove they really existed. What is more strange is that Nibley then fills his book with citations about actual ancient biblical writings that are in museums today, such as the copper scroll in Jerusalem containing the Book of Isaiah. Why then not a single Book of Mormon plate?Incredibly, Nibley goes on to say of the modern paper edition of the Book of Mormon that it is "a far more miraculous object than any gold plates would be." Really? Anyone who accepts this reasoning is not thinking, but such hyperbolic flights are the hallmark of Nibley's writing (see my other reviews of his books).On page 370 of Nibley's book, he writes that, "In the Nephites we have a small and mobile population, living in quickly-built wooden cities, their most ambitious structures being fortifications of earth and timbers occasionally reinforced with stones."Doesn't the Book of Mormon mention some 38 cities by name? Doesn't the Book of Mormon say that the Nephites built a temple "like unto Solomons?" They were also settled enough to have a money system. So what Nibley is saying doesn't even apply to the claims of the Book of Mormon.When you think about the phrase "quickly-built wooden cities," it is quite humorous. Nibley is trying to make them quickly disappearing! But such ruins (including garbage heaps) are a heaven for archaeologists.Also, in several places, Nibley misquotes and misrepresents his sources. On page 371, for example, he says that "English archaeologists are always confusing Neolithic, British, Roman, Saxon, and Norman ruins."His source (Curwen, Neolithic Camps) says, "It is extremely difficult to eradicate erroneous popular beliefs." His other source (Crawford, "Barrows") says "Castle Mounds are often mistaken for barrows." In other words, it is not "English archaeologists," but the public that mistakes these ruins. Another of Nibley's sources ("Prehistoric Fortifications in Bavaria," by Wagner) says that extensive study has "enabled us to distinguish between Pre-Roman, Roman, and post-Roman remains."Also, all these scholars give long lists of what was found in these ruins. Having used archaeology when it suited him, Nibley ends his book with an attack on archaeology. His section headings are a confession that he has failed to prove anything. They include "Limitations of Archaeology," "A Disappointing Picture," and incredibly the "Scarcity of Stone." Nibley should have taken one of the highly advertized "Book of Mormon Lands" tours and see all the stone ruins of the ancient world.What Nibley is doing is rattling on and speaking without authority on the subject, desperately trying to account for the lack of archaeological evidence in support of the Book of Mormon. He also uses a lot of emotional hyperbole. On a single page (p. 23), for example, Nibley uses the following phrases--"remarkable vindication," "striking hints," "odd coincidences," "astonishing parallels," and "perfectly familiar." To the educated but uniformed reader, it sounds like something has been prove.Nibley was a master at word games (pages 232-233). He takes a word, or the root of a word, then traces it back to the beginning of time--but carefully ignoring the Bible. There is no method to this false reasoning. Nibley allows himself to choose words here and there over thousands of years out of dozens of cultures.Anything, of course, can be proved with such a method, including that the novel "Manuscript Found" is an ancient document. Spaulding's novel is full of words that could be traced back thousands of years. Nibley, of course, does not note this fact.Here is another bogus claim by Dr. Nibley--see "Since Cumorah" (page 171):"We have discussed elsewhere the surprising presence in the pages of the Book of Mormon of a full-blown Qasida or primitive desert poem, recited under exactly the proper circumstances and in exactly the proper form by Father Lehi."Nibley's reference is to his own book, "An Approach to the Book of Mormon" (page 225-228).Nibley is just engaging in hyperbole. His hyperventilating of the content of a couple verses in First Nephi does not justify such statements--a "full-blown Qasida." Please. Give your readers a break.Here are the lines (and he only gives one example) that Nibley quotes from the Book of Mormon:"O that thou mightiest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast.And immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!"Then Nibley lists his version of the elements of a Qasida. Note his first item.A song inspired by the sight of water gushing from a spring or running down a valley. So that's how Nibley gets "water" into the Book of Mormon lines. He can't find the word "water," so he plays with "valley" to fit his rule for a "full-blown Qasida."If Nibley's readers would slow down and not be intimidated by such words as "Qasida," they would soon begin to see all kinds of flaws in his logic.And again, not that there is no "water" in the one Book of Mormon example that he quotes! Nibley is simply doing is throwing around scholarly terms that are not justified by his citation. His purpose is to make educated Mormons feel good about subjects that they know little about. Such "scholarship" is something that Mormons, themselves, should denounce, rather than waiting for outsiders to do it.Another example appears on page 233. Nibley takes the name "Korihor" in the Book of Mormon and notes all kinds of connections with the ancient past, but he does not even mention the similar names in the Bible--"Kohath," "Korah," and "Korahite."Linquistic Acrobatics!And what about the roots of those words? Nibley says nothing about them. Robert Wauchope in "Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents: Myth and Method in the Study of the American Indians" called such word games "linguistic acrobatics."Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents Myth Method in theSee my reviews of the following books by Professor Nibley.

Mormons can praise Nibley till the cows come home, but that will not change the fact that he misrepresented his sources.The great question (and the one that Nibley did not answer) is where are all those Book of Mormon plates today?

Like other books by Hugh Nibley, "Since Cumorah" is brimming with faulty logic. On pages 6, Nibley says some Book of Mormon verses were changed to "avoid confusion" (a phrase used twice on one page). But on page 8, he says that the Book of Mormon's "meaning is always clear."Nibley says that the name "Benjamin" was changed to "Mosiah," and asks if this was really necessary. He does not say that the name was changed in two places and that Joseph Smith himself made the change.Nibley's language also appeals to emotion rather than reason. Describing the Book of Mormon, he says it is full of "inexhaustible invention combined with such unerring accuracy and consistency....the artist must not only balance a bowl of goldfish and three lighted candles on the end of a broomstick while fighting off a swarm of gadflies, but he must at the same time be carving an immortal piece of statuary from a lump of solid diorite" (page 159).Wow! Talk about hyperbole! But rather than going on and on in this manner, Nibley should have explained the 4,000 changes in the Book of Mormon (marked in an original edition of the Book of Mormon and published by Jerold and Sandra Tanner. See: "3,913 Changes in the Book of Mormon."Good scholarship requires that you cite the critic's books and respond to their arguments. Nibley doesn't do this.Nibley also asks how a "twenty-three-year-old backwoodsman in 1829" could make up a description of "an ancient coronation ceremony."First, Nibley was aware, of course, that Joseph Smith lived on Palmyra's Main Street as boy and then only two miles away on a farm. The Palmyra area was not in any sense the "backwoods." Rather, it was a settled farming region with bookstores and newspapers in every town. It had not been the frontier since the 1790s and the end of the Eastern Indian wars.The Grandin Book store was only two level miles from the Smith's front door, and some 200 wagons roamed the US selling books to farmers (the bookstore came to the farm). Produce was exchanged for books, and books could even be purchased with "clean rags."Further, the connection of the Smith family to the town was strong. They lived there five years and had a "beer and cake" shop. After moving only two level miles from town, their son Alvin died. Alvin was buried only a 100 yards from the Grandin Bookstore. According to Mrs. Smith, a "vast concourse" of people attended Alvin's funeral.Second, the Bible in II Kings (11-12) and I Kings (1:43-46) describes session, crowning, anointing, proclaiming, sacrifice, and procession.The fundamental error of Nibley's writing concerns his citations of ancient sources at the same time failing to mention the Bible (an ancient source available to Joseph Smith, a Bible reader).Sometimes Nibley's rhetoric gets ahead of his common sense. Of the words in the Book of Mormon, he asks, "...what American would dream of cooking up such combinations as "aa" or "kh"? Hello, how about Aaron? There are many words and names in the Bible with the "kh" sound--"molech," "meshach," and others that can easily be found. Also, in I Chronicles (11:37), there is "Naarai" and "Paari" (II Sam. 23:35).Again and again, Nibley ignores the Bible. In any discussion of gold plates, the gold plate in Exodus (28:36) should be mentioned, and it had writing on it--"Holiness to the Lord."Word games impress the uniformed, and Nibley was a master at them.On pages 62-63, Nibley writes about the famous copper scroll containing the Book of Isaiah."The business of writing on such plates was hard and distasteful work....Writing on plates requires a cramped and abbreviated script, Moroni explains...and Allegro also notes the writing on copper plates actually produces a new kind of writing that is particularly difficult to read, characterized by mixing forms of letters, ignoring the proper spacing between words, "running-over from one line to the next in the middle of a word," and general neglect of the vowels."A greater deficiency lies in ourselves," Allegro concludes, "we simply do not possess a sufficiently comprehensive technical Hebrew vocabulary to deal with a text of this kind." This should have a sobering effect on those people who fondly suppose the if we could only discover some Nephite plates, the translation could be left to them: this sort of things needs an Urim and Thummin, indeed."Now, read the following and ask yourself if Nibley was honest with his source?His source is "The Treasure of the Copper Scroll," by John Marco Allegro (an expert).A. Allegro says that the scroll is in Hebrew and readable (though with some overlapping of words, pp. 27-28). In fact, Allegro provided a facsimile of the entire scroll. On one page is the scroll, and the opposite page is Hebrew writing with the English translation next to it. ALLEGRO DID NOT SAY THAT WRITING ON PLATES PRODUCES A NEW KIND OF WRITING. In fact, he says, "A comparable fault in modern uneducated writing might be the mixing of small and capital letters, although there the differnce would not be so marked as, for instance, when our scribe writs a cursive `aleph" for the normal square-shaped. (letter).B. FACT: The copper scroll was translated by normal means by people who were experts in Hebrew.C. Allegro writes (following Nibley's selected quotes) that: "Happily in our scroll there are no true verbs, where alone vowelling might make a crucial difference to the interpretation. Whilst, therefore, we need not be unduly concerned about the lack of vowel signs in our text...Again, once aware of this failing (or device) on the part of our scribe, we can still recognize the word for what it is. A greater deficiency lies in ourselves....(Note, this sentence quoted by Nibley).D. Nibley has implied that an Urim and Thummin would be needed to translate the scroll, and he has totally distorted the sense of what Allegro was saying.It is also worth noting that if what Nibley says is true about a "cramped and abbreviated style of writing," then it is highly unlikely that any chiastic structures would survive a translation. Some Mormons have claimed that the Book of Mormon has ancient "chiasmus" in it. Chiamus, parallel sentence structure, was actually well-known in Joseph Smith's day.Nevertheless, there is no intentional chiasmus in the Book of Mormon. Joseph Smith was a repetitous speaker and even produced a chiasmus in his introduction to the Book of Mormon (now dropped). Joseph Smith didn't know when to stop talking. His prayer for the opening of the Kirkland Temple took some two hours. Such a man could compose an historical novel.See my reviews of other books by Mormon writers and my non-Mormon "Listmania."Your comments--positive or negative--are appreciated. Thanks.
