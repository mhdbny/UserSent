Marlon Brando's tortured performance and Maria Schneider's sumptuous beauty drive "The Last Tango in Paris," an otherwise straightforward arthouse film made infamous for its (for the time) graphic sex scenes. Before director Bernardo Bertolucci would hit his stride with emotionally and cinematically vibrant films like "1900" and "The Last Emperor," he operated on a much smaller scale, preferring introspective dramas like this one. Brando plays a skulking widower who throws himself into an increasingly disturbed fling with the sexually free young woman (Schneider) who falls for him. As emotions boil to the surface, the two find themselves on a collision course with disaster. The thin plot--made thinner by Brando's sometimes hokey ad-libbing--is just an excuse to watch these two performers, and this is where the film shines. Brando has rarely been better; his Paul is a fascinating amalgam of rage, grief, and lust, driven mad by forces he can't control. Schneider is stunning, both in portraying the conflicted sensibilities of a young woman who is simultaneously worldly and innocent and for just being downright gorgeous, undressed and otherwise. The two have genuine chemistry onscreen, and in the handful of trysts they perform, are entirely believable as a couple. That Bertolucci photographs them in warm light against squalid backgrounds adds an air of eroticism to a film that is more about the dangers of desire than the joys of romance. As with "Monster's Ball," though, its willingness ultimately to allow the performances to take center stage is both an asset and a liability for "The Last Tango in Paris."

Sidney Poiter is one of my favorite actors. He is not only smart and talented but also embodies a sense of decency no matter what character he's playing. In this, he is like few other actors. (Gregory Peck and, to a lesser degree, Robert Redford come to mind.) He has enormous charisma even in some of his later, less satisfying movies. It is not an accident, corny as it may sound, that I was inspired as a boy to even consider teaching by his turn in "To Sir, with Love"; I've long since moved on from any such idealistic notions, but Poitier made teaching an even nobler calling than it is. I was surprised that I'd not seen "Lilies of the Field" until recently, both because it is one of my mother's favorite movies and because it got him a well-deserved Academy Award. (I'm also surprised that it was directed by Ralph Nelson, whose eclectic body of works includes the uber-violent "Soldier Blue" a few years later.) The story is sweet and grounded in reality. A handyman drifter encounters a group of destitute, mostly German nuns who through a combination of beguilement and determination get him to build them a chapel. For most of the film, Poitier's Homer Smith butts heads with Mother Maria Mathe (Lilia Skala), whom at one point he compares to Hitler. She is tough-as-nails, and in one particularly charming scene, out Bibles the Baptist Smith in a contest of using scripture to find a way to not have to pay him. Smith, or Schmidt, as the nuns call him, ultimately and not surprisingly comes around to their way of thinking. Based on a novel by William Edmund Barrett, "Lilies of the Field" is sentimental without being treacly, succeeding more because it is honest than because of anything manipulative. It doesn't ram religion down anyone's throat, and yet makes believing in something more meaningful than petty self interest as natural an expression of human experience as eating and breathing. Even Jerry Goldsmith's modest score, including the hymn "Amen," never overshadows the sincerity of the emotions. The movie may seem quaint in this age of mega churches and assembly-line tithing and salvation, but, its dramatic qualities notwithstanding, "Lilies of the Field" says more about the spirit of what it preaches than a thousand fire and brimstone types resorting to telling rather than showing, or, perhaps, pontificating rather than living.

As introspective as it is violent, "Brother" manages to do what few Hollywood gangster films can--entertain and make you think. To call the plot Shakespearean almost seems an insult, as its sensibilities are so obviously Japanese, with the emphasis not on the action but on the effects of it, but careful observers may see strains of "Macbeth" and "Richard III" in this very grown-up feature (with a little Sergio Leone thrown in). Director and star Takeshi Kitano follows the last days of a disgraced Yakuza in America, whose brilliant but brutal rise to power in modern L.A. is matched only by the intensity of his loyalty to his friends and half-brother. Omar Epps is a likable presence as one of those friends, and the many familiar Japanese-American faces--including veteran James Shigeta--blends ably with the mostly Japanese cast. But it is Kitano that delivers the goods, wisely choosing to underplay Yamamoto as a pillar of quiet strength rather than allow him to become broad-based caricature. In fact, the understated tone of the film is what gives it so much style and intensity; few American films would be bold enough to focus less on the shoot 'em ups and more on the aftermath or to raise the issue of black-on-Asian racism in a gangster movie. That the story ends up pretty much where you expect it to is less a flaw than the culmination of a satisfying slow burn, making this gem a must-see.

A friend said that while Tim Burton's "Batman" was 90 percent production and 10 percent story, "Batman Begins" is the opposite. He's right. This "reboot" of the "Batman" franchise succeeds on many levels, not the least of which is having a rip-snorting spirit. Smug/creepy Christian Bale seems an odd choice for the role of caped crusader but proves effective as a Dark Knight actually like the one I remember from the comic books. Even if much of the story territory is familiar in "Batman Begins," this version takes a refreshingly serious path and doesn't bog down under its own weight in camp or pyschobabble. Director Christopher Nolan wisely chooses to play it straight, creating a film close in spirit to those of 25 years ago ("Blade Runner" is rumored to be an inspiration; it felt to me in moments, too, like the TV series "The Equalizer."). The film's wonderfully effective, minimalist soundtrack by Hans Zimmer combines with straightforward production values and confident direction. And except for a so-so Katie Holmes as the love interest (all of the Batman films seem to be lacking in the leading lady department), the supporting players, including Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman (so much like the 1970s' Jim Gordon it's scary), and Michael Caine, are superb. The only real problem with "Batman Begins" is the third act, whose primary conflict is reminiscent of the train chase in the latest "Spiderman" movie, though there's also an eerie parallel in Gotham's rapid descent into madness and despair to the recent events in New Orleans, right down to the bumbling of so many police. Life imitating art? No, "Batman Begins" somehow manages to seem that real. Kudos to the engineers on this DVD, too, especially the sound folks.

With his jug ears, lizard eyes, and peanut head, Wil Smith is an unlikely candidate for leading man, but given the times we live in, he's probably just about right. In "I, Robot," the high-tech, low-brow adaptation of the classic Isaac Asimov story, he plays pretty much the same guy he always does . . . hip, cocky, fast talking, street smart, etc., etc. Perhaps on purpose, he looks the human version of the robots, which themselves appear the result of mannequins who traded stem cells with Robocop and an iMac. Just bolt some skin to the frame and put him in a leather coat conveniently in style today even though the film takes place 30 years from now and, well, you get the point. A clever attempt to give the film more subtext than it has -- you know, robots aren't much different than us? Or perhaps a plot twist? I suppose if you care you'll have to find out for yourself.The film retains some elements of Asimov's seminal work, though in many ways, it has more in common with 1972's "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes," with its examination of slavery as a theme and even a guy jumping out of a high rise to his death, and the far superior "Bladerunner." The story's mystery is predictably shallow, about the same as the one in "Minority Report," which it also mimics, and to make up for it, there are plenty of action set pieces, done with expensive but sterile CGI effects. Essentially, robots programmed with three laws against harming humans start to do just that, starting with their creator. What follows is a revolution of sorts, threatening Shannon Elizabeth clone Briget Moynahan (bad) and the often irritating Shia LeBoeuf (good), who Hollywood in its infinite wisdom seems bound and determined to turn into a star regardless."I, Robot" isn't a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either. Visually, it has its moments, but the story never rises above a shallow examination of the premise, and the product placement borders on the absurd. Yeah, it's a summer movie. But that's all that it is.

"The Pledge" features a slew of actors I know are talented -- Sam Shepherd, Aaron Eckhart, Mickey Rourke and Patricia Clarkson, for instance -- and yet rarely feel compelled to watch. The centerpiece is the great Jack Nicholson, a guy who never gives a boring performance and is doubtlessly even more interesting in real life. Sean Penn directs. The whole thing has the potential to grind to a halt under its Oscar-caliber weight but never does. Instead, "The Pledge" is a compelling story, mostly because everyone works so hard to never get in its way. It is drama the way drama is supposed to be, the way American films used to be able to tell a dramatic story but for the last 20 years it seemed only foreign films could accomplish. The plot is as disturbing as it it is simple: A little girl is brutally murdered, a suspect is caught but commits suicide, and a retired cop must chase the mystery with only his instincts to guide him to the real killer. Nicholson provides a "regular guy" gravitas to a role so different from his usual shtick that he deserves special consideration just for that. And even if Sean Penn is doing a Bob Raphaelson impression in more than a few scenes, except for some annoying quick zooms, he is deft in his approach as director. Anyone watching "The Pledge" and expecting the standard Hollywood whodunnit will be disappointed; this is a steely drama as wrinkled and foul as real life. In many ways, it is a character study more than a drama, and in this, the low budget works to its advantage. Watch it if you want a break from the usual plastic of modern movies and instead want a grown up film that seems ironically more real than it should be. "The Pledge" quite simply works.

I must admit that "Lifeforce" is a guilty pleasure, a loud, colorful, decidedly overblown takeoff on the Quatermass-style thrillers of a generation before (and perhaps inspired by "Queen of Blood") that works mostly because it is so unashamedly determined to. Once one gets past the idea that 1980s London would be the seat of an alien invasion -- and that the British will ever get involved with serious manned space exploration (no offense to my English friends, but come on) -- the premise is actually rather good; that is, that vampires are real, only alien, and that they absorb from us not our blood, but the very essence of that which gives us life. Though he's less animated than the corpses in the film, American Steve Railsback is the ostensible hero here, an astronaut who is the lone survivor of a doomed international expedition to explore Halley's Comet. Through a series of mishaps, the crew of the Churchill resurrect three of the aliens, who then wreak havoc on Earth while they await the arrival of their mother ship. The cast in "Lifeforce" is mostly of the "B" variety (and a few "C"s), including a creepy and pre-"Star Trek" Patrick Stewart, but Peter Firth really steals the show as crisp British agent Colin Caine, who deserves his own movie. And they are so doggone earnest that it's possible to overlook the occasional lapses in character. Much is made of the lovely Mathilda May, who thankfully spends most of her time unclothed, yet the film's production in general is equally impressive, especially with the cockeyed but stylish direction of Tobe Hooper. While "Lifeforce" generally reaches beyond its grasp, with some pacing problems and mumbo-jumbo dialogue, the film has enough spooky moments to merit a look. One of the better is when a sympathetic ally is revealed to be a foe.

Robert Altman's meandering, &quot;we'll put it together in editing&quot; directorial style lends an air of documentarian authenticity to this grim western, set in a snow-covered northwest mining town peopled by an aimless mob of mostly European immigrants. With no heroes to speak of, the film chronicles the downfall of an ambitious, if inept, entrepreneur (Warren Beatty) and his drug-addled prostitute partner (Julie Christie). Less about living than about survival, the film not surprisingly offers little in the way of plot, but it's nihilistic themes ring true with the moody acting of its leads and the dusty, sepia tones of its imagery. A particularly ironic moment of social commentary occurs when, after helping the town's whites save their church from a fire, an African-American couple just wanders away from the resulting celebration quietly, knowing they are no longer welcome. Leonard Cohen--less gravelly than usual but as hopeless as the guy with the guitar in &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;--provides the soundtrack with a patina of sadness common to films of the early 70s.

Before "Godzilla" was turned into a colorful film series for the kids--and before it was turned into an high-priced snoozefest starring Ferris Bueller--the story of a resurrected dinosaur terrorizing Japan was a tragic and brilliant cautionary tale of science gone wrong. The American re-edit of this seminal Japanese film features Raymond Burr as a reporter who is pulled almost literally into the story of a lifetime, as he witnesses the berserk creature destroy modern Tokyo. With its atmospheric cinematography, serious tone, and sincere acting, "Godzilla" is as effective as any other classic of the period, including "Them," "The Thing from Another World" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Even American adults used to offering snickers and snide remarks about Japanese monster movies will find little here to deride, other than, perhaps, the overreliance on Burr's narration. (Of course, the joke's on them--few of those films are aimed at anyone older than a young child.) It's good enough that Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg would seem to raid "Godzilla" for ideas in their modern redux, the "Jurassic Park" movies.

Just when you'd think we'd had enough movies about the history of Europe--geez, already, is this the only continent in the world besides North America?--along comes "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World," a ripping sea yarn worthy of C.S. Forester. Though it lifts quite a bit from Forester's "Horatio Hornblower" novels--and the TV series, "Star Trek," which was inspired in part by Hornblower--Peter Weir's film production is quite satisfying. Russell Crowe continues to move up the acting food chain, steadfastly commanding both ship and screen as Captain "Lucky" Jack Aubrey, a character few contemporary actors could inhabit. Crowe, a legitimate movie star, appears to relish the role nearly every boy dreams of some day having--heroic sea captain. The story is reminiscent of the second Star Trek film, as Aubrey's H.M.S. Surprise (a la Enterprise) battles a mysterious French raider that initially leaves his ship crippled and then plays a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with the survivors (a la Star Trek II). Crewed by both boys and men (wonderfully played by all involved), the Surprise is out-of-date technology (a la Star Trek II) but with the help of the ship's doctor (a la Dr. McCoy), Aubrey trades blows with his deadly opponent. The entire production is topnotch, with a keen eye to such details as the proper salute for the early 19th century and the relative youth of the ship's officers, the only flaw being a battle tactic that is forecasted so clumsily even people stepping out to use the restroom would figure it out. Still, a sequel is definitely called for--and Weir and Crowe should continue to make worthy films like this one.

When &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; premiered in 1979, many fans of the original series were elated--and many more disappointed. The problem wasn't that the film was cheap or puny in scale, nor that it hadn't finally reunited the primary &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast members, some of whom hadn't been before cameras in years. Thanks mostly to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; sci-fi fans by then had developed a ravenous taste for big-budget space opera and because the series had become more cartoonish as the 1960s wore on anyway, they now expected something that would outdo the George Lucas shoot-em-up.What they got instead was a bold, if flawed, attempt to return things to the more serious and understated tones of &quot;Star Trek&quot;'s first season while simultaneously pushing the special effects envelope. And though &quot;Star Trek&quot; always was space opera with harder sci-fi leanings, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; mistakenly abandoned most of the space opera standards altogether--interstellar battles, &quot;ray gun&quot; fights, scantily-clad &quot;moon maidens,&quot; strange and menacing aliens--in favor of an approach that was more in keeping with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot; The story of the revamped Enterprise's rush to stop a cloud-like entity's march toward earth became, in the end, mostly a platform for technical, not cinematic, achievement.In the years following the film's release, Director Robert Wise did not conceal his disappointment with both the movie's final cut and its critical reception, but thanks to the advent of sophisticated computer graphics, he finally got his chance to complete the film as intended two decades later. The result is a mixed bag.Certainly, the director's cut is more streamlined than its predecessor--several edits speed up the action, and even some of Jerry Goldsmith's excellent orchestrations seem faster. The reimagined special effects are, for the most part, an improvement (watch carefully, for instance, to see a shuttlecraft from the series depart the San Francisco port), though anyone expecting images on the order of &quot;The Matrix&quot; or the later &quot;Star Wars&quot; films will be disappointed. (I'm guessing the technicians had to match image quality to that of the 1979 release.) The credits definitely look better.But the major flaws of the film, including a second half that just seems to drag compared to the first, are intact. Worse, because at least one version of the film with additional footage already shows us what is possible, some of the choices of what to cut and what to keep are questionable. Gone are some great character moments like Kirk telling Bones to get out of his quarters and the computerized translation of the doomed Klingon captain (though some make it as deleted scenes on the bonus disk). Perfectly adequate sound effects, too, have been replaced by others that seem tinny, and many of these effects compete rudely with Goldsmith's score. All in all, the Director's Edition seems a tradeoff, worth viewing mostly by the diehard fan, who will also likely find the second DVD more interesting than the usual chatter and mugshots tossed into the mix.

Star Trek VI abandons the cutesy humor of the previous two films, wisely returning the series to its serious roots. Kirk and crew are swept into a Cold War game of cat-and-mouse when the Klingon emissary they're assigned to protect is assassinated. Along the way, Kirk must confront his anti-Klingon racism, while Spock faces personal challenges of his own. Darker in tone (revealed particularly well through Cliff Eidelman's effective Batman-like score) and genuinely suspenseful, the film suffers only from a sense of failed grandeur--we keep expecting to see great battlefleets that never materialize. Director Meyer's characteristic anachronisms abound--the crew sleeping in WWII-style bunkbeds; an actual galley aboard ship--but he keeps the pace right, and sexy Cattrall and Iman are welcome additions. This is the last Trek featuring all of the original crew, delivered on a DVD that looks and sounds good.

Dean Martin's Matt Helm series is often the subject of sneers when not lovingly being played up in the Austin Powers parodies. Truth be told, unless you're a fan of the genre, there is little reason to watch them other than the presence of Martin, who a few years younger and in a different universe might have made for a pretty good spy in a serious film. Like all of the American attempts in the 1960s to copy James Bond, the Matt Helm films fall way short of the mark, a kind of chintzy Las Vegas version of 007's eurocool. (James Coburn's Flint films probably are closest to being rivals; ironically, films like Flint and Helm would predict exactly where Bond would end up in a few years.) That said, I still get a kick out of them. Sure, the production values are low -- and the level of wit even lower -- but there's a certain joy in watching Dino booze his way through one silly escapade after another. And the whole spy movie genre deserves at least one look. My favorite of the Helm films is still "Murderer's Row," whose Lalo Schiffrin title song and jokey, breezy pace (not to mention Ann-Margret) are worth two hours of attention. I still laugh at the jailhouse scene, particularly when a menacing but temporarily defeated Karl Malden is salved with the offer to "find someone for you to run over" on the way back to his lair. "The Silencers" and "The Ambushers" are worth a look, too (and a listen, as Dino sings some good tunes, including "South of the Border"), leaving only the well-named but odd "The Wrecking Crew," which meanders between trying to take itself seriously and not, the weak link. If you think Bond is sexist, wait until you meet "Lovey Cravesit" and other raunchily-named supporting characters or see the house that appears to have inspired Quagmire's abode on "Family Guy." Dino is also surrounded by a fine cast of mostly B-list actors, including James Gregory (Helm's boss in the first three films; he would revise the character, more or less, on "Barney Miller"), Stella Stevens, Elke Sommers, Victor Buono, and others. The Matt Helm films are unabashedly crude, even with some mod fashions and jazzy scores, but in a strangely innocent way, like when a 7-year-old starts running around the house and repeating the cuss words she's overheard. I've read some discussion that the aspect ratios of the Helm DVDs are innacurate to the original prints, but not having seen them, I can't say. I can say that about the only other way to see the Matt Helm films at all is to catch them all carved up on a local station at 3 a.m. Now, that's just plain wrong.

Ponderous, but not particularly enlightening or entertaining, "Murder by Numbers" struggles as a thriller, despite the fact that it features just about every cliche one would expect in a cat-and-mouse cop movie. right down to the "You're getting in too deep" speech by the boss. Sandra Bullock stars as Casey Mayweather, modern cinema's cockeyed idea of a heroine. She is stoic, selfish--though, of course, we're to believe that's really just because she's emotionally vulnerable--hard-drinking and sexually aggressive. In short, she behaves like the stereotype of a man until half way through the film when she gets to develop actual human feelings, and the only reason we should care about anything she does seems to be her looks. Bullock chooses to show these qualities mostly by talking deeper and slower than usual and not smiling unless she's doing something mean-spirited or self-satisfying. Oh, and to be particularly gritty, she keeps her hair in a ponytail. The actual story seems to take about an hour too long to tell. Two creepy and smarmy but privileged high schoolers in California (once more shown by Hollywood as a racial undiverse state, desite reality) decide to kill a woman for the thrill and challenge. Mayweather chases them. It's nothing you haven't seen before in one form or another, just not as good; at the very least, Columbo dished out better versions of the same idea every week. Minor diversions in the story, such as Mayweather's seducing her partner, generally make her character seem like a pig rather than a rebel, and the fact that she survived an abusive relationship that apparently motivates her interest in the case only seems tacked on. Even a scene where one of the killers comes on to her and she injures him while half-heartedly thwarting his advances is particularly odd. She's more invested in the killer's welfare--a wormy guy whose power over people is baffling--at that moment than she was after sleeping with her befuddled partner, who seems to be falling for her. In the end, the story winds its way to a conclusion which is neither suprising nor revelatory.

Like all good film science fiction, &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; keeps its concepts simple but their ramifications grand, which is just one of the reasons it is a timeless classic. Made at a time when sci-fi was the junk that kept restless kids in theater seats on Saturday afternoons, this ambitious take on Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot; nonetheless also aims for adults that grew up on the pulp fiction of the 1920s and 30s. (Its delightful production design is a seamless mix of colors, forms, and shapes familiar from those imaginative magazine covers.) The premise is Star Trek a decade before Star Trek, as a military cruiser commanded by the hard-nosed but humane J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen doing an effective melodramatic turn) visits a world populated by a secretive scholar (a wonderful Walter Pidgeon), his curious daughter (a sometimes grating Ann Francis), their robot butler (the epitome of mechanical men) and a mostly unseen terror (illustrated by topnotch Disney animators). Beyond great special effects and an innovative musical score, the film also engages a firm--if now familiar--science fiction plot, unlike so many of the noisy and expensive but ultimately overwrought and empty-headed sci-fi movies of today.

Director Fincher takes his death fetish to new lows in this grim and mostly pointless followup to Aliens. In this one, Ripley--perhaps the universe's most unlucky astronaut--washes up at a penal colony that makes Alcatraz look like a Howard Johnson's at sunny Myrtle Beach. She's joined by a dour cast of British unknowns (a wasted Charles Dance being the major exception), which coupled with the pseudogothic production design, makes the film feel like a bad Henry James novel come to life. With hints--hints--at some deeper meaning, the story basically rehashes the first film; this time, though, the apparent innovation is that prisoners are picked off one at a time by a fast-moving alien that has combined with canine DNA. Masochists undoubtedly will enjoy scenes like the child from the previous film, Newt, being autopsyed, but most viewers will just shake their head at this relentlessly unhappy movie.

Much is made, of course, of the camp value of the "Batman" TV series which spawned this entertaining 1966 theatrical release, but few people seem to recognize the rather sturdy filmmaking that it represents. Beyond the pop art and the sometimes archly satirical screenplay, "Batman" is a pretty enjoyable spectacle for many reasons--nothing along the lines of "Lawrence of Arabia" but a good time, nonetheless. All-but-typecast stars Adam West and Burt Ward bring comic zeal to their uber-serious comic book identities, well matched by co-stars Frank Gorshin, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero, and Lee Meriwether, as supervillians Riddler, Penguin, Joker, and Catwoman, respectively. Director Leslie Martinson does little to differentiate the film from the show visually--which is good--but there is a sense of urgency that makes the nearly two hours zip along rather nicely. The story is straight from the comics, as the villains join forces to thwart Gotham's caped crusaders and kidnap leaders from this postmodern universe's version of the United Nations. The science is pure hokum, as illustrated by a submarine that is as much bird as fish, but like so many 1960s creations, it's the stars and production that take the limelight. New is a Batboat, a seaworthy version of the famous Batmobile and Batcopter, both along to round out a 10-year-old's dreamteam of inventions. Nelson Riddle provides a wonderfully jazzy score. In many ways, "Batman: The Movie" succeeds where the later Batman films often fail; sure, it isn't dark and psychologically topheavy, but it is fun, something that can't really be said for any of the more recent incarnations . . . with the possible exception of the excellent animated series.

Horror movies today are more about tragedy than fear - that's one of the reasons they're not much fun anymore. There's plenty of gore, of course, to satisfy the lust for sadism in some of us, and there's usually a slew of more or less sympathetic characters in jeopardy, though increasingly they fall into the less category. "28 Days Later" has its following, which is to say it basically fits the categories described above. In what is essentially a retelling of "The Night of the Living Dead," much of the world - in this case, England - is turned into zombies with no intention other than to murder anyone who isn't one of them. There's an attempt at explaining why the zombies exist, but it's not really needed since their function is mainly as soul-less enemies to be dispatched. Featuring a cast of capable actors - Brendan Gleeson and Naomie Harris are the only real standouts - the film follows the usual low budget (some might say minimalist) formula as the survivors try to find what is left of their civilization. The biggest problem with "28 Days Later" is that it suffers from a case of the stupids. On at least two distinct occasions, the hero (creepy Cillian Murphy) acts on his own foolish impulses, leading to two deaths directly, yet we're supposed to sympathize with him. Why? I guess because he's English, he's not really stupid, he's "flawed." The film's attempts at creating emotional investment in the characters never quite work; they find themselves in strange little joyful moments, such as the looting of a grocery store or what amounts of a city joyride, that would probably seem quite mad were it not that the movie so sullenly wants us to feel good about these poor people, some of whom we know in the formulaic way are destined to be dispatched. Even the twists here feel less so than just another version of any number of cynical films, though I will give the ending some credit for resisting the contemporary cliches. If there are moments of brilliance in director Danny Boyle's film, it's seeing the largesse that is London in silence, though a soundtrack that isn't quite as ethereal as it wants to be might pique the interests of some moviegoers. If you want flat characters in a flat narrative with a lot of gore and sadness, then this film is for you; if not, get something redemptive by Universal or Hammer films, made before 1968, of course.

Perhaps the best -- and smartest -- Saturday morning cartoon ever in America, "Johnny Quest" follows the exploits of Dr. Benton Quest, a super-scientist of the ilk we thanked was on our side during the Cold War. He's aided by Race Bannon, pilot and secret agent, and his son, Johnny, his chum, Hadji, and their dog, Bandit, as they operate from a high-tech island sanctuary and travel the world in search of mystery and knowledge.The Quest's imaginative adventures were a mixture of James Bond, Saturday matinee sci-fi, and the Hardy Boys (as well as some earlier book adventures that were remarkably similar), with plenty of spies, pirates, headhunters, and communists to thwart. It was made for kids, but unlike so much today, it wasn't juvenile, often putting the Quests in real danger against enemies whose vehemence was tangible, and still allowed Dr. Quest to act as a responsible but not overwrought parent.For a weekly series, the artwork is superb and free of the busyness of today's animation, and like so many shows of the era, there is a wonderful low-key atmosphere to the production. Even the opening and closing credit sequences mimic those of live action TV, with a jazzy score to boot.Not much since has been made to rival "Johnny Quest," though the equally fun "The Venture Brothers" today does a fine job of parodying the show. (Alas, though, when will Gen-X find a way to create something original rather than always have to rip on others' work?)Though "Johnny Quest" might be legitimately criticized for too often using stereotypes, especially for the non-white enemies (Dr. Zin is straight out of Yellow Horde paranoia), on balance, the show does a pretty good job of having an international flavor and certainly is no more problematic in this regard than, say, "The Incredibles" or other cartoons with a narrow focus of what the world looks like and who is good and who is bad.

Neither of the abysmal recent television adaptations of Jules Verne's classic novel manage to capture the tragically noble essence of Captain Nemo as well as this sweeping and colorful 1954 Disney adaptation. Whereas the predictable contemporary direction is to create an obsessed sociopath consumed by his own rage, Disney's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" sticks to Verne's original vision of an elegant but tortured genius who vows to rid the world of war by hunting the seas for those who traffic in human suffering. The spot-on James Mason brings Nemo to life with just the right touch of brilliance and sadness-we know he is doomed to failure, yet despite his misguided methods, there's a part of us that roots for him and his cause. Paul Lukas is wonderfully sympathetic as Professor Arronax, the soft-spoken, Victorian biologist who begins to identify with Nemo; Peter Lorre, as the professor's skulking assistant, Conseil, and Kirk Douglas, as Ned Land, the brash harpooner that ultimately causes Nemo's undoing, provide much of the comic relief. But even the solid cast must compete with Harper Goff's version of the Nautilus, quite possibly the most successful blend of technology and imagination to ever grace the silver screen. In a production that shines--from the beautiful cinematography to Richard Fleischer's sure-handed direction to special effects that are wonderfully tangible in this age of cold computer effects--there is a feast for the senses in every scene, and Paul Smith's evocative score--Douglas' musical number notwithstanding--will stay with you long after the credits roll. Disney deserves kudos for producing a DVD that is lovely to look at and packed with extras, though we probably could live without the myriad commercials at the beginning of the main disc.

"Captain America" is a well-crated redux of clich&eacute;s, and in this, it's the superhero version of "American Beauty." If you like "Captain America" -- and given its acting and production values, you probably will - it's because you've seen it all before somewhere else. You can tick off the standards: outcast superhero, Steve Rogers (who's basically the kid that gets sand kicked in his face in those comic book Charles Atlas ads), eccentric but well-meaning scientist with the German-Jewish accent (Albert Einstein, Hans Zarkhov, etc.), sadistic Nazi bastard (take your pick, Indiana Jones movies, The Phantom, The Rocketeer, The Marathon Man, etc.). It's full of romanticized 40s nostalgia, so much so that everyone, even the baddies, is apple-cheeked and there's no need to put minorities in it unless they accidentally walk by in the background. Captain America himself is Hitler's wet dream in the sense that our buff, blond and blue-eyed Olympian is essentially everything the Germans were after, the master race but on our side, by golly, and since Hitler's evil and we're not, it's all okay (and he's got that nifty, muted American flag costume to remind us). None of this is a problem necessarily, but to enjoy "Captain America," you have to be prepared for it. If not, you'll find it pure corn and not a little propagandistic, albeit with a slick retro quality that might make you want to believe the world was ever actually like this. If your politics run toward accusing Hollywood of liberalism, you'll find this movie difficult to fit into that viewpoint. There's not much to say about the plot. There's an evil Nazi running around with his own agenda and a wholesome hero who must stop him. That's about it. The rest is a well-photographed exercise in flag waving. Chris Evans, who looks like a less creepy version of Ryan Gosling, is fine in the limited role, and his female handler, played by Hayley Atwell, is basically today's version of Emma Peel. Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving, and Tommy Lee Jones are quite competent. The film reminded me of Disney's "The Rocketeer," which wasn't surprising given that both were directed by Joe Johnston, who gives the whole thing a Steven Spielberg gloss when he was in his prime. Though I had to fight to stay awake in parts and was a little distracted, I'm not sure that was entirely the movie's fault, but I will say watching it was the equivalent of eating a Big Mac on a full stomach.

"High Noon" deserves its place as one of the top 100 American films of all time. Gary Cooper gives a powerfully restrained performance as Will Kane, a man of conscience whose decision to stand his ground against three outlaws results in the desertion of nearly everyone in his life. That the story is a thinly-veiled assault on McCarthyism is beside the point; it also serves as a reminder of the brittle patina of community that unites mainstream American culture. As in the typical modern suburb, the townspeople here go through the motions of civility, only to quickly devolve into me-first survivalism when their public notions of camraderie are tested. Told in "real time," the film hits all the right marks: great script, straightforward direction, "real time" pacing, and a haunting score by Dimitri Tiomkin (with vocals by Tex Ritter, who actually sounds like Gary Cooper singing, matching the sense that the songs are Kane's conscience). Supporting performances by Grace Kelly, Katie Jurado, Harry Morgan, and Lloyd Bridges (as a wormy deputy) are terrific, as is what amounts to a cameo by Lon Chaney, Jr. In fact, though audiences tend to remember most Kelly's role as Kane's conflicted wife, it's really Jurado's performance that stands out, as she ably plays the streetsmart Mexican immigrant who is shunned by the community (the subtext being that running the local saloon and brothel is the only work the community permits an "outsider" like her to do.) That films like "Rio Bravo" and the "Dirty Harry" series would essentially take the Kane character and give him a different political slant is a testament to the endurance of Fred Zinnemann's western outting. One warning: contemporary audiences expecting an action film may be disappointed to discover that "High Noon" is a drama with action overtones, meaning the film is a lot more than just over-produced gunfights and empty moral platitudes.

Cary Grant's second-to-last film, "Father Goose," is harmless enough, one of those mid-60s comedies that occasionally strays into adult territory while remaining steadfastly family-friendly. Grant plays Walter Eckland, an American expat blackmailed into being a Pacific island coastwatcher in the early days of World War Two. The ramshackle bachelor is happy enough beachcombing and searching for the bottles of booze hidden by his friend and sometimes tormentor, Commander Frank Houghton (Trevor Howard), the Australian officer who abandoned Eckland on the deserted island in the first place. That is, until a miscalculated rescue attempt of another coastwatcher instead leads to his picking up a blueblood schoolteacher (Leslie Caron) and her gaggle of tween charges. In short time, they oust Eckland from his shack, hide his alcohol, and generally take to making his life a royal pain. You can see where this is going. Grant is, of course, excellent as always and plays what is essentially the prototype for Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison a few years later. You may even be surprised (or disappointed) to discover Eckland's pre-war vocation. Caron is unfortunately less capable in a role that requires her to be both charming and charmless at the same time, a kind of nagging wife figure who must inevitably come to understand the error of her ways just as Eckland has to finally grow up. She is also made to look more severe than in films like "Fanny" and "An American in Paris." One wonders how the role would have been better interpreted with someone with greater range, such as Audrey Hepburn. Ralph Nelson's direction is straight-forward in a production that relies on the natural beauty of the South Seas for its tropical appeal - he would lose a lot of this visual sensibility within a decade with the well-intentioned but ultra-violent "Soldier Blue." While there are some tense moments with the nameless Japanese villains, the tone of the film is mostly light, a romantic comedy that occasionally labors to find both its love and laughs but in the end is a genial way to spend a few hours. If you want to see a better romantic comedy with a middle-aged Grant, check out the superior "Charade," made only the year before and featuring the lovely, lovely Audrey Hepburn. Unlike this one, however, it did not receive an Oscar nod for screenplay.

"Wonder Boys" came with a sterling recommendation from a friend--an MFA in creative writing--who swore it was the most true-to-life movie about writers he'd ever seen. So, I watched it with the appropriate mixture of anticipation and reservation, and as often happens when something is hyped, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. In fairness, it's a pretty well-made movie, a kind of indie ... that has a sense of grit and gristle usually missing from Hollywood films. The soundtrack is cool. The locations are Pennsylvania dingy. It captures the oaken squalor and pompous self-importance that is a four-year college English Department (even if no one there ever does any work). And it has a stellar cast; Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Frances McDormand, in particular, deserve kudos for inhabiting their roles. But, the movie also has Robert Downey, Jr., to contend with, which makes me wonder just what compromising photos his agent has to regularly get this one-note male version of Winona Ryder work. It wants to be set in the late 60s, though it purports to be contemporary. And it's characters--while quirky--never quite seem arthouse authentic; in fact, Douglas' Grady Tripp is the rumpled, immature, oversexed pothead everyone thinks is the prototypical English professor, right down to sleeping with the department chair's wife (McDormand). Of course, there are professors who fit this stereotype, or at least parts of it, but the combination is cliche and calculated to give Grady excuses for his screw-ups rather than show him to genuinely be a screw-up. The plot is mostly a mishmash of set-ups for ironic, semi-literate dramedy--think "Sports Night" meets "Henry and June"--as Grady's intoxicated life starts to come apart, and by the time his fecund manuscript blows into the river (Grady eschews word processors and photocopiers, it seems), it devolves into farce. And it uses a voiceover, a big no-no among screenwriters! Still, even with all that against it--and a happy ending, to boot--there is just enough goofy charm to make "Wonder Boys" worth a look, mostly the result of the actors' sincerity. If you're a writer or, goodness help you, an English professor, just remember to keep one eye closed.

It's easy to see from "Notorious" why Cary Grant's name was bandied about to play James Bond -- his stellar performance here brings to life exactly the sort of conflicted emotions that are trademarks of the hard-edged but romanticized super agent in Ian Fleming's pages. In fact, it's not too hard to imagine that the author used the characterization when dreaming up 007. As an intelligence operative seeking to thwart post-war Nazis (led by an almost sympathetic Claude Rains), he is at once ruthless and noble in his determination to use the disgraced daughter (mesmerizing Ingrid Bergman) of a treasonous American to his advantage. That they fall in love is inevitable, but Hitchcock's stylish direction and the smart screenplay by Ben Hecht allow the proper amount of angst to make "Notorious" rise above simply being a well-crafted thriller. The performances by the three leads are impeccable, multi-layered and often quite subtle, with the only real flaw in the film being a need for about 10 more minutes of story to let things boil over more (the diabolical mother of the Rains character, for instance, never exactly gets her villainous moment in the sun.) Kudos to Hitchcock and Hecht for giving the bad guys the pretense of civility rather than simply making them the cartoonish thugs of lesser films.

James Coburn is among my favorite actors -- he might not have been as handsome as, say, Cary Grant or Gregory Peck, nor as suave as Sean Connery or Rock Hudson, but he could carry a film as easily as any of these leading men. What Coburn brought to his roles, long before it became de riguer, was a steady but self-effacing cool, with quite a bit more humor than Steve McQueen or Lee Marvin, who approximated him physically. That his career did not go further is a mystery to me, but thank goodness we have the films he did make. Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round is a cryptic title until you get the reference in the film, but it's a fine hold-up movie, and the sort that keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.Coburn plays Eli Kotch, a grifter who, among other things, charms his way out of prison by bedding the state's psychologist (Marian McCargo, a cross between Barbara Billingsley and Dina Merrill) before making his way across the country in a series of interesting cons that net him women and money. It's all to buy the scjematics for an airport international bank's security system, which he plans to crack with the help of his gang (Aldo Ray, Michael Strong, and Severn Darden, whom Coburn would again co-star with in the excellent The President's Analyst). At risk are the usual close calls, but what elevates Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round from the usual caper film is its focus on both character and location, giving the film a more introspective geography than most. Watching it, one can see hints to what later would become standard elements of both Tarantino and Coen Brothers films, and in fact, it's rather surprising in particular the latter chose to remake True Grit and not this film.A special note must be made about Camilla Sparv, who plays Coburn's duped wife in this film. First of all, she is genuinely beautiful, and not just the standard icy blond, but her performance shows a grace and vulnerability that only a few actresses manage. She's no Audrey Hepburn or Ingrid Bergman, but her turn in this film, as well as the underrated farce Murderer's Row, suggests she should have had a better career than she managed.Robert Webber, too, brings dimension to the role of a put-upon secret service chief who has to contend with a visit by a Russian premier that, along with protests at the Los Angeles Airport, makes for the sort of confusion that Kotch is counting on. Webber often played Madison Avenue types who were affable if scheming but slightly befuddled, but here his performance manages to give the character more sympathy than he could have had, especially given the time the film was made.The movie is so good, it predicts what a superior film -- McQueen's The Thomas Crown Affair -- would accomplish much better two years later: deal with the romantic conflicts. Whereas that film makes Crown's uncertain romance with the one woman who might jeopardize the success of the crime central to the plot, this one only marginally does (though it does have a twist at the end that is on the order of Frank Sinatra Ocean's 11 in its irony).That's a shame because both Coburn and Sparv do a ducj wonderful job of making audiences believe they could and should be a couple, which is especially challenging because Coburn plays that oft romanticized character in American film: the sociopath. Unlike Crown, who was simply bored and turns to crime for the challenge and the excitement, it's obvious that Kotch enjoys his duplicity and has very little feeling for anything or anyone else. Yet, in perhaps a greater con, we root for him.Writer and director Bernard Girard made one for the ages with Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round. I just wish he'd made more films, and that Stu Phillips had scored them, too.

In an age when most commercial films are really just big TV shows with bloated budgets, cheesy acting and clumsy handling, "Miller's Crossing" reminds us of why we go to movies in the first place. Lovingly cinematic and with subtleties of character that bely their simplicity, this Coen brothers production takes us on a wonderful ride into the pulp fictional world of gangsters. Gabriel Byrne is near perfect as Tom, the tight-lipped lieutenant of an aging mob boss named Leo, played warmly--but with teeth--by the delightful Albert Finney. Dirty dealings and doublecrosses aside, the story is really about love--love of man and woman, love of brother and sister, love of friends, love of surrogate father to surrogate son. Entangled in a brewing gang war and his own conflicted affair with Leo's girlfriend (luscious and sharp-tongued Marsha Gay Harden), Tom must play his cards close to the vest in order to survive and protect those he cares about. Like all of the Coens' films, "Miller's Crossing" will remind you of other things--the ending seems straight out of "The Third Man" and a character name even pops up from "Rear Window"--but part of the joy is seeing their love of film reflected in the events onscreen. Along the way, the Coens manage to reinvent sounds and images we've seen a thousand times before, so that the staccato burst of a Tommy Gun or a dueling fist fight seem suddenly fresh and brilliant. Add a terrific soundtrack, and the result is a cinematic experience, not just a movie. Look for Coen regulars Steve Buscemi, John Turturro and Jon Polito in smaller but effective supporting roles.

Sam Peckinpah's "Major Dundee" is famous for having been edited into a muddled collection of scenes that bely the director's original vision for a western odyssey. This extended version no doubt improves upon the original, truncated theatrical cut, but it's still tough to watch. That's not because the performances aren't strong. Leads Charlton Heston and Richard Harris are in top form as former friends now on opposite sides during the American Civil War. The rest of the cast, especially the late, great James Coburn and Jim Hutton, turn in spirited efforts at bringing the story to life, but with the slapdash editing and strange plotting, there's not much anyone can do. The story is nothing special in that a cavalry troop -- this one composed of both Union and Southern soldiers, as well as civilian volunteers -- gives chase to a renegade Apache band that has massacred not just their fellow soldiers but most of the settlers they were to protect. Fleeing with the settler's older boys, the only survivors, the band heads for Mexico but not before Heston's Dundee makes it his mission to track them down. It's the stuff of dozens of "B" westerns, but Peckinpah adds a zest for stage blood, especially in rivers, that only he can during the often surprisingly bland fight scenes that intercut a fizzled out romance with busty Senta Berger and the requisite male bonding moments. Strange, quick editing cuts and a lame voiceover effort by a young bugler add to the sense of attention deficit disorder throughout "Major Dundee," which is tragic because the first hour of the film is quite gripping, and there are a variety of moments that belong in a better film: the results of the massacre, Heston's address to and nonchalant walk through the rebel prisoners, the bugler's first love and the older men's reflecting on it, Harris' various moments of charm and his tirades, and the revelation that a character suspected of being a spy wasn't. If Peckinpah's much longer original cut managed to bring more moments like this to life, then the studio should be ashamed for having not allowed it to make it to audiences. As it stands, though, what we have here is not yet there, either, and out of respect, it probably should be reserved for viewing only by diehard Peckinpah fans.

A John Carpenter movie is a lot like a Big Mac--not the most gourmet of offerings available, but almost never unsatisfying. &quot;They Live&quot; is among his lesser-known gems, a high-concept if low-budget sci-fi outing that pits Carpenter's counterculture sensibilities against the rabid consumerism of the 1980s. Here, wrestler-turned-actor Roddy Piper shines as a drifter who stumbles upon a terrifying secret: the aliens we've watched the skies for have not only already invaded, they've taken over. Years before the overrated &quot;Matrix&quot; films would posit that our reality is not our own, &quot;They Live&quot; imagines a world in which the bulk of humanity unwittingly has become enslaved through a combination of mind control and marketplace manipulation. The joke is that the aliens don't want to kill us; they simply want to turn us into product-buying sheep, distracting us as they swipe our natural resources, all with the help of a handful of superpowerful human sellouts. Carpenter's satire of America's yuppie mallculture hits home, right down to the notion of only the poorest and most dispossessed among us being able to see the truth (with the aid of special sunglasses that penetrate the aliens' electronic disguises). "They Live" is as funny as it is biting, with quite probably the best fistfight ever filmed, and features all the hallmarks of Carpenter at his best: a terrific score, a plot that crescendos to a cool climax, and a visual style that supplants the lack of big Hollywood dollars.

Replace the allegedly anti-Semitic, alcoholic ax wielder from "The Patriot" with taciturn Jimmy Stewart, and you've basically got "Shenandoah," a well-meaning film whose strength lies in its performances and sentimentality and certainly not in its plotting.Cribbed a bit from the better "Friendly Persuasion," the plot concerns an irascible Southern farmer (Stewart) who stubbornly -- and correctly -- refuses to let his sons join the lost cause that is the American Civil War. His stand is less a moral than a selfish one, and there are several effective moments where is proven right, not the least of which is the slaughter of the command of a young officer who just minutes earlier challenges Stewart's stand. Stewart's point that Virginia didn't lift one finger to help raise his children is an economical and rational defense to the argument that their lives are nonetheless owed to the state.There are other scenes that rather maddeningly come close to making this a better film than it is: an otherwise capable officer's (Doug McClure, who could be played by a prettied-up Matt Damon in a bio-pic) nervous asking for Stewart's daughter's hand in marriage, Stewart's demands of a sympathetic union colonel (a self-effacing George Kennedy), his fury at the young sentinel who shoots one of his sons, a brief but bloody battle, and the quiet horror when murderous scavengers inevitably invade his all-but-deserted home.Unfortunately, they're blunted by some rather dopey elements, including Stewart allowing his youngest son (rather annoyingly referred to as "the boy") to trundle about the countryside wearing a discarded confederate cap along with his gray clothes (you can see where that's going), his leaving his home virtually defenseless when horrific battles are occuring just miles away, and the baffling conclusion son Glenn Corbett comes to upon seeing the decimated troop his father kept him from joining.In fact, I found myself at the end less moved by the power of the story and more irritated as to how Stewart's character, despite his ego, determination, and self-righteousness could not see that had he simply told the kid to take that hat off, none of the tragedy in the story would have happened. I generally prefer older movies because they're so much smarter and more natural than newer ones -- but not this time.Stewart and the rest of the cast are quite good, though Patrick Wayne is so toothy in his role that you might be torn between sorrow and relief by the ultimate fate of his character. And, despite its thematic heaviness, the film often has much lighter moments more appropriate for a Disney film, which ironically may be what finally holds everything together. Watch for a young Katherine Ross in a supporting role, and try to ignore some of the historical liberties. (While I'd give the film five stars for its performances, the brainlessness of the plot knocks it down to three.)

Of all the actors to play James Bond, George Lazenby probably comes closest to resembling physically and tempermentally the character that Ian Fleming created on the page. The irony, of course, is that so many people are turned off to him as Bond. He certainly is handsome enough to play Bond in the film and undeniably fit enough for the part, too, yet his acting style--admittedly rough in parts--is no match for Connery, obviously still the reigning 007 after all these years. What's left then is a stellar production, based on, perhaps, the best Bond story, if not the most fun (&quot;Goldfinger&quot;), believable (&quot;From Russia with Love&quot;) or outrageous (&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;). Closely following one of Fleming's last novels (when the writer was already in poor health), &quot;On Her Majesty's Secret Service&quot; is a return to character-driven story for adults, where a cynical James Bond ultimately resigns as a spy to exact a personal justice on his archenemy, SPECTRE's Ernst Stavro Blofeld (a pre-Kojak Telly Savalas, solid in the role). Along the way, he rescues a suicidal countess (the magnificent and luscious Diana Rigg--by any chance, Dame Rigg, are you interested in marrying me?) who turns out to be his match in every way. As in Fleming's novel, the film effectively combines melodrama with the sturdier themes of time, love, and fate, as Bond races the inevitable, a half step ahead of the enemy. Though some of director Peter Hunt's quick, zooming cuts during fight sequences may dizzy you, he commands an ahead-of-its-time sensibility in many scenes, which are crisply photographed and capably staged (the only real exceptions being some of the rear-projection work). Add John Barry's terrific score--including a bold instrumental opening theme--topnotch production values, great moments that speak to Bond as a person rather than an icon, and Bernard Lee's wonderfully irascible &quot;M&quot; and Lois Maxwell's warm &quot;Moneypenny,&quot; and the result is a flawed but still terrific 007 outting, well worth adding to a film collection.

"A History of Violence" is an odd duck, a kind of art house film dressed up as a gritty thriller. While he never really establishes it as either, director David Cronenberg sometimes comes close in what often feels like a nod to both Sam Peckinpah and Ernest Hemingway. The strengths of the film include abrupt scenes of violence, not quite as visceral as Peckinpah in his heyday but certainly effective in a latex-y, shiny sort of way, and a scene where a picked-on teenager turns the tables on oppressors. The first of two sex scenes is both goofy and touching and will no doubt shock a few viewers in flyover country; the second is in the vein of the infamous rape scene in "Straw Dogs," though it doesn't leave us quite as shaken. Much like the film itself. The story concerns - shades of Hemingway's "The Killers" -- a small town diner counter man, here named Tom Stall (capable Viggo Mortensen, combining the dead eyes of Jon Voight and the reptilian charm of Bill Pullman), who becomes a hero after efficiently dispatching two psychopaths (including Lance Hendrickson clone Stephen McHattie) bent on robbery and worse. Cascading events force Stall to confront a past that may or may not include his own evil ways. Sexy Maria Bello is his conflicted wife, Ed Harris provides his usual steady menace as middle management, and William Hurt continues to try to reinvent himself, this time as a unredeemable monster with the funnier quips and a parody of an East Coast accent. While the script often wanders into B-movie territory with predictable lines and setups and a too-fast climax, and actors occasionally seem to be phoning it in, "A History of Violence" should keep your attention, especially the first half, where Cronenberg allows things to simmer. As the DVD shows, Cronenberg also chooses to cut a dream sequence but for the wrong reason; he felt it deserved to be in another film, when it really would have just been just another clich&eacute;.

"The Missing" is one of those meandering existential westerns where the characters who deserve to live die and the characters who deserve to die live. Cate Blanchett -- whose visage not only looks like it should mark the prow of a Nordic herring boat but is about as animated -- heads up the cast as a frontier healer whose deadbeat dad (Tommy Lee Jones) comes to visit just in time for her oldest nitwit daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) to get kidnapped by a group of renegade Apaches. We've seen the story before if not quite so heartless; think "The Searchers" if it were imagined by someone in a biker gang, only in this case, it's Opie (Ron Howard) at the reins. There's some grim fates for many characters and a few action sequences, but none of it has much forward momentum given that the plot is so determined to be unlikable. Jones gives one of his standard wounded performances, and he is good, as is Jenna Boyd as Dot, the other daughter, but with so little of value to work with, even they are unable to resurrect what amounts finally to an exercise in masochism. You'll be saddened to see that Eric Schweig, so effective as Uncas in "The Last of the Mohicans," looks as though he's had one too many turns at the buffet table. Squint and you'll see Val Kilmer turn up as yet another incompetent Army officer.

Neither Billy Bob Thornton nor Halle Berry are among actors whose movies I flock to see, but their performances in this film are no less than extraordinary. Berry in particular sheds her usual one-note theatrics to inhabit a character so blisteringly real it's almost impossible to believe this is the same actress that made "Swordfish"; she deservedly won an Academy Award for her portrayal here. Peter Boyle and Heath Ledger give effective performances in smaller roles, and even P. Diddy himself manages to do more than stare blankly with mouth agape. The Raymond Carver-esque story intertwines a series of tragedies stemming from an execution, all of which could become camp if it weren't for the capable approach of director Marc Forster. Though the plot is pretty thin--the only real weakness to the film--characters and performances are strong enough to keep the momentum going. Even the infamous steamy sex scene packs a wallop, both for its gutsiness and for the savvy of the actors (the lovely Berry again deserves kudos for finding the emotional center of her character in what might otherwise have seemed an exploitative scene). It's rare that I would characterize a film as raw and honest, but these are two words that definitely apply to "Monster's Ball," and I'm eagerly awaiting the next projects from Thornton and Berry.

In general, when I watch a Kevin Costner film, I root for the bad guys that wish to do him ill. Once in a while, one of the wooden actor's films temporarily changes my mind: "The Untouchables" and "Dances with Wolves," for instance. "Open Range" had me cheering for the Costner character, Charlie, in part because he is allied with the almost always satisfying Robert Duvall and in part because one scene in the film delighted me in a way I thought today's American movies could not. It happens late in the film, during the obligatory exchange of unpleasantries that precedes the obligatory shootout. I don't want to spoil things too much, but suffice it to say taciturn Charlie dispatches the local gleeful sadist with precisely correct and swift Old West justice and redeems himself from some rather boneheaded decisions earlier. What follows is one of the better shootouts in recent years, a crackling melee whose inspiration is more "High Noon" than "Gunfight at the OK Corral." That said, "Open Range" suffers from the typical flaws of modern filmmaking, such as a first half that confuses having people do things with having people do things that are interesting. It's clear that Costner's understanding of the genre isn't as complete as, say, Clint Eastwood's, even if the pacing here mimics that of "Unforgiven," and he manages to get what is at best an adequate performance out of Annette Benning. Michael Gambon, as the Irish brute who lords over the town, is sufficiently vile, if cliched; he practically froths at the mouth, his sneering brogue a constant reminder he ain't from around these parts, and despite the fact I couldn't get past Duvall calling the late Michael Jeter "Old Timer" when the latter looks 15 years younger, I found Jeter's performance as a friendly stable owner rich. Duvall, it should be noted, seems to be playing pretty much the same character he has since "Lonesome Dove" (if not "Tender Mercies"), and it's a good thing he owns it, as it is simply delightful to see him bring to life a guy you wouldn't mind living next door to or working with. While "Open Range" vaccilates between upholding the mythology of the Old West and skewering it, Costner's performance and direction are fairly solid, if not quite as sure-handed as in "Dances with Wolves." There are even a few moments of clever subtlety, as in the obligatory male bonding moment, where Charlie inquires about his boss's first name; it's intimated from an earlier scene that beyond solidifying friendship, this is precisely the sort of information that might be needed on a tombstone.

It's been a long time since I binged on anything on TV . . . unless it's animated, I hardly know what the heck is on anymore, getting only this and that while somewhere else since I refuse to bend over for the whole cable/satellite/narrowcast thing. Two minutes of crap programming, eight minutes of crap commercials, and $75 a month, repeat -- no thanks. But "Louie" . . . even when it falters, it's too good for television. That includes the second season, which in terms of comedy is more uneven than the terrific first season but darker and more dramatic. In fact, many episodes of the second season of "Louie" are composed more like a good literary short story (as were some in the first season), taking the viewer down roads they think they've traveled before but ending up in far different places. For instance, Louie's ongoing attempts to woo his PTA friend, Pamela, who tells him repeatedly and often without mercy how unattracted to him she is, nonetheless serve as the focal point for several episodes, culminating in an airport goodbye scene that threatens to break your heart, if you have one, before finding an alternative. (The irony of Pamela's caustic but well-intended lecture to Louie about being so screwed up as to hopelessly focus affection on her when she won't return the same sentiment while she jets off to Paris to reconcile her marriage to the man who deserted her and her children is not lost on the audience.) In another episode, Louie's too-big-for-her-britches 13-year-old niece condescendingly lectures Louie on how it is condescending to give money to the homeless, and the opportunity for a smart-alecky retort is traded for just letting the ironic scene take its course; Steven Wright's advice to Louie to live a little after a great set ends in a disaster far worse than could be imagined. "Louie" even manages to get a duckling into several episodes without disintegrating into a morass of cheesy sentimentality. That is all quite a feat. "Louie" traffics in ongoing themes, especially the titular character's struggles with relationships (and as a breath of fresh air for TV, not just romantic but as a divorced parent who's male), but also takes swipes at race, pregnancy, sexual orientation, the generation gap, and religious hypocrisy. In a three-camera show with a studio audience, the jokes would be predictable and safe, but Louie, despite its sometimes wacky situations, doesn't settle for anything that rings hollow, offering the audience insight in addition to sometimes hard-won laughs, all to suitable jazz riffs. While tinny stuff like "Mad Men" and "Breaking Bad" get all the acclaim, "Louie" is at least as good as drama and a lot more interesting. The bonus is that it's also funny for all the right reasons.

Director "Bloody Sam" Peckinpah takes a cue from Ernest Hemingway in this visceral and, perhaps, most frank depiction of male hostility ever put on film. The concept is simple: a pacifist professor (Dustin Hoffman) settles with his restless, beautiful wife (Susan George) in the bleak farming village where she grew up. Their marriage as incomplete as the house they share, the mismatched pair live isolated from the world, save for four Alpha-males hired as handymen. They openly mock their employer, testing the professor's masculinity through varying degrees of humiliation while being spurred on by the flirtations of a wife whose sexual longing for them outweighs her fidelity. Hoffman and George give excellent performances, but it is director Peckinpah who is the real star of this gritty film. Refusing to pull punches, he vivisects the complex psychology of male aggression that is so often dismissed as simple and meaningless in society. While the film is violent--including a controversial and graphic rape scene that questions the nature of responsibility--it is the brooding air of tension permeating the film that is the most disturbing. Pay attention to little touches that drive the story, such as George calling not for her husband to rescue her in the film's bloody climax but for one of the rapists. David Mamet would explore similar territory in his own ode to Hemingway, "The Edge," but with less memorable results.

In many ways, "Some Kind of Wonderful" is yet another John Hughes re-tread of white teen angst in 1980s America. There's no doubt that Hughes was a marketing genius, in that he tapped into what his narcissistic market--white suburbia--wanted so hungrily to see, which was itself as the star of little morality plays with cool soundtracks and hipster clothes. Certainly, this movie provides all that. On the other hand, "Some Kind of Wonderful" manages to do what other lesser-known Hughes productions do not: create a story that is still universal and affecting, even after all these years. Much of the credit goes to the two leads, Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, who each give understated and honest performances that are far more moving than their stereotypical characters generally deserve. More sincere than the manipulative "Pretty in Pink," more thoughtful than the mega-hit "The Breakfast Club," and more meaningful than the fluffy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Some Kind of Wonderful" suffers mostly from bad timing--had it premiered a few years before Hughes had saturated the market with his cookie-cutter productions, it probably would have been a far bigger hit. As it stands, this story of a genuinely nice kid chasing the wrong girl--with the conflicted help of the right girl, who loves him--rises above the standard plasticky fare of the period; you're truly moved by the end of the movie, rooting for its leads to find the love they undoubtedly deserve. Even if it borrows from "Cyrano De Bergerac" and a host of other works--and pretends that minorities only exist as background extras in some other movie--"Some Kind of Wonderful" stands on its own, perhaps because director Howard Deutch adds just a tinge of sadness to so many scenes, even the comic ones. Here, young love is not about passing notes, holding hands, and making out; it's about actual human relationships, good and bad.

This early Paul Schrader effort is as slick--and vapid--as the city in which it's set, yet still strangely compelling after all these years. Richard Gere delivers his usual flat performance as the titular character, a walking billboard for all that's wrong with style over substance; here, though, his monotone facial expressions and speech actually work, as the character has the emotional range of his condo's designer furniture. Ironically, model-turned-actress Lauren Hutton delivers a surprisingly steady and honest performance as his love interest, despite having to utter lines that often barely rise above soap-opera level in quality. But the real star of the film is the production itself. The visual and aural model for what would become "Miami Vice," the film still seems modern, crisp, and glossy, even with the poofy hairdos, micro-shirt collars and tinny hatchback cars. The story is little more than fluff; Gere's Julian is framed for murder, and Hutton--the wife of a bigwig politico with much to lose if their affair is discovered--is his only alibi. In a half-hearted attempt to infuse some much-needed moral fiber, Schrader forces Julian to confront the many people he's wronged, as well as the empty but expensive lie that is his life, including hints at the character's bisexuality (controversial stuff in 1980). Despite Hector Elizondo's caricature performance as a Columbo-esque detective and the fact that the film celebrates being shallow as much as it condemns such behavior, it scores some hits, not the least of which is the breezy opening song by Blondie.

Alfred Werker's "He Walked by Night" is a gripping thriller that succeeds because of its purity of execution. Yes, there are many styled film noir elements, the best of which includes a sewer chase as good as the one in the more famous "The Third Man," but nothing about the contrasty lighting or inventive camerawork interferes with the story or the performances, both of which are refreshingly earnest. Long before he became TV's Admiral Nelson and later the inventor of KITT in the first incarnation of "Knightrider," Shakespearean-voiced Richard Basehart turned in a bravura performance as Roy Martin/Morgan, the smug, murderous sociopath who thinks he's outwitted the police at their own game. Handsome enough to play the hero, he nonetheless easily embodies villainy. The film is framed by a narrator, usually a sign of narrative weakness, only here it adds to the brooding documentary style of a procedural we're told is taken from an actual Los Angeles crime file. Uncompromising -- and realistic -- in its presentation of evil as so ordinary we'd hardly notice it, the film simultaneously avoids giving in to cheap manipulations. Thus, Martin/Morgan has a dog but does not abuse it, and a scene where he extracts a bullet from his side is more intense because of Basehart's reaction than any needless gore or special effects. The cops, including stone-faced Scott Brady, are as matter-of-fact as the real thing, but the script injects a fair amount of character-driven humor. Look for a very young Jack Webb as 1948's version of CSI and sci-fi perennial Whit Bissell when his hair was still black.

Though I feel a bit out of place reviewing a &quot;Next Generation&quot; Star Trek Film--I was never a huge fan of the second Star Trek TV series or any that came after it--there's enough wrong with this particular entry to deserve comment. Even on the small screen, ho-hum Jean-Luc Picard and crew were tedious substitutes for the original series' wonderfully adventurous and colorful characters, and it's that lack of charisma that is the main problem with &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis.&quot; Without caring much about the characters, there's no emotional punch to the film's often poorly conceived and executed scenes, even if some seem lifted from the much less expensive but much more watchable predecessor, &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.&quot; In this one, several rather awkward plot contrivances pit a heretofore unknown clone of Picard named Shinzon against the Federation, though the reasons for the clone's psychotic hatred against humanity are murky, at best. (From what we see onscreen, it makes more sense for him to hate his Romulan keepers.) While the film's opening ten minutes are gripping--featuring the brutal assassination of the Romulan government--things go downhill from there, including a tired wedding sequence that has little to do with the rest of the film, several space battles created with topnotch special effects but that are as exciting as watching bathtub toys bobbing along, and the inevitable, surprisingly bland face-to-face confrontation between Shinzon and Picard. The film's pace and story are so unengaging that I even had time to consider how silly it was to use vehicles with wheels in an age of spaceships zipping around (through a ship's corridors, no less) and people beaming themselves from place to place; &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; gave me plenty of time to disengage from what was happening on the screen. So far, only one &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie has held my interest--the surprisingly fun &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;--but that's probably because it came closest in spirit to the 1960s TV series (though it contradicts what we learned there). Even Jerry Goldsmith's score can't seem to pump any excitement into what should have been Captain Picard's finest hour.

Pierce Brosnan is often better as 007 in non-James Bond films than he is in the real thing-and "The Thomas Crown Affair" leads the pack. In a remake almost as good as the original, Brosnan generally delivers the goods, playing a bored multi-millionaire who pulls off high-stakes art heists for fun. When he meets up with the savvy insurance investigator (Renee Russo) hot on his trail, romantic sparks fly. It's all done with slick polish by underrated action director John McTiernan, who deserves to helm a Bond film some day, should the producers want to make Bonds for grownups with taste again. But as good as the cool and collected Brosnan is, he's no Steve McQueen, having the looks and style but lacking the quiet angst, and, therefore, edgy subtext that propelled the first Thomas Crown. (Ironically, Brosnan often plays 007 with exactly that kind of angst, which creates discord with the juvenile scripts and cartoonish nature of most contemporary Bond films). Other weaknesses include an ending that undermines the cynicism of the original and Russo, who is just way too manly to be believable as the brainy sexpot she's supposed to be. Wow, tastes have changed. However, the lovely Faye Dunaway, who played the role in the first version, shows up in an all-too-brief cameo here. Of course, seeing Dennis Leary with what appears to be either a $2 haircut or a dead blonde animal on his head might be worth the admission, and the climax of the film, like the earlier caper, is a hoot. All in all, this version of "The Thomas Crown Affair" is meant to be a surefire crowd-pleaser, calculated, in much the same way as the first few Bonds, to make women swoon and men walk out of the theater a little taller. In that respect, it succeeds ably and stands up to repeat viewings. (I'd prefer to give it four and half stars, but I'll go with five.)

'Heist' is a 'thinking man's' thriller, full of great lines, genuinely suspenseful scenes, and clever, one-upping machinations that showcase the creative minds behind them. Gene Hackman is simply stellar playing a seasoned professional out for one last score, and Delroy Lindo is excellent, as always, here playing Hackman's friend. The rest of the cast, including Danny Devito, Sam Rockwell, Patti LuPone, and Rebecca Pidgeon, gives 'Heist' an ambience of working-class smarts, while Ricky Jay nearly steals the show as a deadpan confidence man with a sparkling wit. The best thing about 'Heist' is that it was made for adults--there are no absurd chases in $150,000 cars, no crew of jugheads walking around in slow-motion while wearing the most ridiculous of contemporary fashion, no screeching garage-band tunes and seismic camera shots to give the audience a skull-splitting migraine while hiding the fact that there's nothing of importance going on. Instead, David Mamet offers rich characters and a believable, if stylized, caper that is more along the lines of what real professionals pull off than anything in the junk that Hollywood typically ships to theaters. And while 'Heist' is not on the order of 'The Sting' or 'Topkapi,' what is anymore? This is the closest we get. A nod goes to Theodore Shapiro for a low-key but memorable score.

Somehow, I liked "Closer" more than I thought it would. I say this because people I trust were unimpressed by it. But I was compelled to watch the Mike Nichols' film for reasons that I can only describe as masochistic - and I'm not a masochist. The characters are recognizable and reprehensible, pretty much the gang of healthy and privileged idiots you can meet anywhere in the U.S. or U.K., where the bulk of "Closer" takes place. The story is a human traffic accident, literally in one scene and implied in another. Though the dialogue is stagy, the actors deliver it with proper angst, which is suitable for a film that is really just barely a play with a few visual tricks thrown in. (A lot in "Closer" happens offscreen and is told in flashback and expository dialogue, the film's major weakness). Jude Law, who resembles rather disturbingly John Boy Walton when donning spectacles, plays a hack writer whose chance meeting with a provocateur (Natalie Portman -- kudos to her for being unafraid to reveal her burgeoning cellulite) and later dalliance with a wishy-washy photographer (Julia Roberts) leads to his eventual downfall. Almost-James Bond (thank goodness) Clive Owen pops in as a dermatologist who isn't quite as thick skulled as he seems. No one is likable in "Closer," which may be part of the reason I enjoyed it; their folly seems to confirm so many of my own observations about people who are incapable of loving relationships with anyone because they don't know the first things about themselves. Yet, fortune gives them a steady stream of paramours to damage. Go figure. Under Nichols' steady hand, including some verbal and visual cues that subtly forecast events, "Closer" wends its way to a conclusion that is inevitable and would be tragic if the characters were even remotely heroic. As it stands, they're just like most of the people you meet.

When I was a child, "after school" specials were a common occurence on TV. These low-budget films essentially took a social issue of the day that affected young people and dramatized them in a way to be lesson-learning. "Precious" falls into that category, though it is significantly more hard-edged than anything that would have been on television in those days. Or today. It is a blisteringly honest film and a capable drama that focuses on Precious Jones, a character who generates great pathos without being pathetic. She has been dealt just about every bad card that life can -- poor, abused, illiterate. She is overweight, a life situation seemingly brought upon by her psychotic mother (played realistically and with vicious cunning by comedienne Mo'Nique), who lashes out at her daughter verbally and physically, including making her stuff herself, all while letting the girl's father rape her whenever he feels like it. The result is two children, one with Down's Syndrome. If you think things can't get more challenging, wait. What is amazing about "Precious" is how easily it piles on the tragedies and yet remains a steadfastly optimistic film. That's mainly the result of the deceptively natural performance of Gaboury Sidibe, who never lets the character tread into stereotype -- even as some may say that the character herself embodies stereotype -- and director Lee Daniels, who has the talent to generally stay out of the way and let the story tell itself. Never having read the source novel by Sapphire, I can only comment that the writing of the film by screenwriter Geoffrey Fletcher is for the most part more than satisfying. The dialogue is natural, especially when Precious narrates; if there is a flaw, it's that while the film does an admirable job of showing her outward struggles, it doesn't always give us the insight to her interior that we might want. Think of films that similarly showed a young woman's struggle against the odds stacked against her, like "Rachel, Rachel," "Georgie Girl," or "The Color Purple," and how they allowed their subjects more internal space. Precious deserves it. Though she sometimes struggles to capture the gravitas of her character, Mariah Carey deserves special attention for appearing as a world weary social worker without her usual glamourous makeup; Paula Patton (hubba, hubba) got my attention even more with it -- I feel a little guilty saying that given the emotional importance of the story, but let's be honest. And Lenny Kravitz acts when not posing.

While Sean Connery still reigns supreme looks-, charisma-, and talent-wise as 007, Daniel Craig gives the classic Bond actor a run for his money in "Casino Royale," the high-octane, high-thrill film that rediscovers the secret agent's mojo. This adventure, billed as a prequel to the Bond series, is really more of an adjustment, giving Bond both blond locks and a Gen-X history to bring him into the 21st century while distancing him from more recent outtings. It also jettisons the paint-by-numbers approach of the Pierce Brosnan films, which capitalized on the actor's contemporary model looks and a formula that while comfortably familiar to some was wearing too thin for others.Here, Bond is raw and hungry, a headstrong, macho torpedo who has more in common with the Bond created by Connery than the one popularized by Brosnan. Not long after brutally earning his 007 status, Bond is sent to capture a terrorist bomber, only to stumble upon a much bigger operation bankrolled by oily gambler Le Chiffre (with a terrifically understated performance by Mads Mikkelsen). Along the way, he's aided by the charming Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and falls for Vesper (vixenish Eva Green), the lovely British agent sent to help him . . . or is she?Staying truer to the spirt of the Fleming novel than much of the film series that followed, "Casino Royale" still manages to inject stunning stunt and action sequences, orchestrated with the surprisingly steady hand of director Martin Campbell. While the generally serious tone of the film (read: it takes itself seriously) has much to do with its success, most of the credit belongs to Craig, who turns in a performance that somehow mates the deadly frank approach of Timothy Dalton to the confident masculinity of Connery. The result is the best Bond since Sir Sean stepped down.Other highlights include Dame Judi Dench's meatiest performance as M, a decent, if derivative, score by David Arnold, and a script (polished by Paul Haggis) that gives Bond some smarts again. Even the romance here works for the most part. All that said, are there some problems? Sure. Good as he is, Craig is still rough around the edges, the film could have benefitted from about 10 minutes more of romance, and there are plot points that are, to put it kindly, murky. But, hey, if "Casino Royale" is the blueprint for future Bond films, then these weaknesses can easily be overlooked. After all, as someone put it, this is less a James Bond film than a film about James Bond.

Though it lacks the quiet dignity of the original, Jonathan Demme's talky update of "The Manchurian Candidate" manages to hit enough points to qualify as a watchable thriller. The story, of course, has been updated beyond its Cold War roots, meaning the communists aren't the villains anymore. (I won't tell you who they are, but aside from Nazis, who is a villain of convenience nowadays?) That also means that the plot is needlessly top heavy with details and machinations, turning a story that originally was chilling in its simplicity into something cumbersome, as well as more brooding than frightening.Likable Denzel Washington steps into Frank Sinatra's venerable shoes as Ben Marco, the Army major unfortunate enough to have his squad turned into diabolical experiments in mind control. This time, he isn't suffering only from nightmares but from what seems the worst case of Gulf War Syndrome on record. Lacking the pathos of Lawrence Harvey, Liev Schreiber makes for a reptilian Raymond Shaw, the soldier at the center of what may be a fantastic assassination plot, only this time, he's a senator with designs on the White House. (This script jettisons the Johnny Iselin character, thus robbing the movie of some of the original's bitingly satirical moments; it also maddeningly reduces Shaw's near redemptive romance with a political opponent's daughter to an expository footnote and trades the functions of some characters.) But perhaps the biggest flaw is Meryl Streep's generally histrionic approach to the role of Raymond's mother. As acclaimed an actress as she is, Streep's portrayal seems a burlesque of Angela Lansbury's stunning foray into villainy.Demme's direction is less taut than in "Silence of the Lambs" and showier but often less effective than John Frankenheimer's - oddly enough, some deleted scenes show a better grasp of the concept than what made it into the theatrical version. The original, an almost perfect film, remains the definitive version.

Though not as strong as Stanley Donen's earlier Hitchcockian pastiche, "Charade," "Arabesque" has enough going for it to merit repeat viewings--and release some day on DVD! Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren prove that true movie stars can overcome sometimes plodding pacing and creaky scripts to make two imperfect cinematic hours enjoyable. Here, Peck endures threats, chases, doublecrosses, and blows to the head with Cary Grant-ish aplomb (no surprise, as the script was originally written with him in mind). He's matched ably by Sophia Loren, who in addition to looking absolutely gorgeous, seems genuinely to be having fun. The plot involves Peck, an Oxford professor and cipher expert, being pulled into spy goings-on between Middle Eastern factions in England. Like "Charade," it's unclear until the end who is really working for whom, but that really isn't important anyway, as the script is often needlessly murky and sometimes too dry for what is essentially a light comedy-thriller. Alan Badel, though, is terrific as the Cobra-like villain, and the production is sumptuous, from Maurice Binder's stunning opening and closing sequences to Henry Mancini's suitably menacing but energentic score. Special recognition is deserved for the cinematography and Donen's direction, which in addition to being sparklingly beautiful, often reflect inventive photographic choices. Though "Arabesque" generally flies under the radar of today's moviegoers, fans of "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" might want to watch this film's assassination sequence, which to me bears remarkable, um, similarity to the one in the sci-fi flick.

Just how does one combine the great Samuel L. Jackson, a crack team of commando police officers, and a villain willing to pay $100 million for freedom and make something as clunky as &quot;SWAT&quot;? Well, if you want the answer to that question, this laborious &quot;action&quot; thriller is for you. As with most contemporary films, check your brain at the door; in fact, the only thing you'll really need it for is ticking off all of the other movies you'd rather be watching. Of course, you could also spend the time cataloging the many films this one seems to raid for ideas . . . &quot;Heat,&quot; &quot;Bad Boys,&quot; &quot;Licence to Kill,&quot; &quot;The Right Stuff,&quot; &quot;Executive Decision,&quot;--not to the mention the 70s TV series upon which it is based. The story--an international gangster gets nabbed and the SWATsters battle former team members to keep him--is just a flimsy excuse for some ho-hum action sequences and lots of tiresome macho posturing. Even the usually ultra-cool Jackson seems bored with the goings-on.

It's tough to tell whether "Castle Keep" is groundbreaking or just plain pretentious--it's one of those films that features an explosion of ideas that on first glance seem to dart off in all directions, only to end up pretty much where you'd expect them to. It does have strong performances and arresting, if frequently odd, imagery. Filmed with lots of quick, often jarring cuts and featuring a thin plot that seems to take the long road to conclusion--you'd think Robert Altman directed it--"Castle Keep" just taunts the senses for the most part until the fiery climax. Burt Lancaster is a one-eyed major determined to hold his position in an ancient castle with a battle-weary squad of men, including Peter Falk, Patrick O'Neal, Bruce Dern, and other familiar faces of the era. Until the Nazis arrive, the men pass the time as best they can, generally loving up the locals or musing about their predicament in slow, moody takes that Terrance Malick would revise in "The Thin Red Line." It's the kind of thing scholars may point to as poignant, even if casual viewers may find themselves with a headache. Watch it most of all to see how actors like Lancaster and Falk can carry a scene, even when it's hard to tell exactly what is going on.

Cheesier than II and teeming with post-Watergate-style distrust of authority, this third Trek is nonetheless entertaining, if only for seeing the original crew in action. Star Trek III subverts its predecessor's poetic ending, burdening Kirk and crew with sometimes forced angst over the death of the heroic Spock. Inevitably, they return to the Genesis planet to confront a Klingon enemy that is more campy than threatening. Shatner abandons his refreshing less-is-more approach to Kirk from the previous film, though he still brings gravity to the character without losing the fun. But the real stars are the co-stars, as Takei, Nichols, and the late, great DeForest Kelley finally get their 15 minutes. Though Nimoy's workman-like direction and a terribly wooden Saavik fail to impress, James Horner's majestic score and ILM's special effects make this one a standout. The worst thing about the DVD is the lack of extras--other than widescreen, this is essentially the same film you could get on videotape ten years ago.

Vastly overrated as a drama and police procedural--"Barney Miller" did much of the same thing in half an hour, even with the laughs--"NYPD Blue" nonetheless benefits from a hard-edged first season that is never eclipsed in the run of the entire series. Say what you will about David Caruso, he is simply magnificent as Detective John Kelly, a hotheaded but oft-restrained boy scout who is the anchor point around which everything in the show's galaxy swirls, including the self-destructive efforts of his angry partner, Sipowicz (Dennis Franz). The show would become slower and more maudlin and soap-operatic once Caruso left, shifting attention to Sipowicz, perhaps the unluckiest stereotype of a Polish-American ever to blot the screen, but there are more than a few gripping and effective moments throughout this season. Of course, Sipowicz isn't the only stereotype, as there are the standard Jewish neurotics, Irish blowhards, Italian mobsters, and others that Hollywood so frequently counts on, even if "NYPD Blue" (and the various "Law and Order" incarnations) continues the bizarre trend of making New York seem a lot less racially diverse than it really is. Nonetheless, the location shooting adds to a flavor of verisimilitude that is satisfying for a small-screen venture, and Mike Post's minimalist score is right on target.

"Deadlier Than the Male" certainly copies the James Bond movie formula--and star Richard Johnson, reputedly once considered for the role, looks like a cross between Sean Connery and Martin Landau. Ultimately, the film lacks enough stylish excitement to be a true Bond contender, though its jazzy score and myriad locations are on par with many 1960s adventures. It may even remind some viewers a bit visually of Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 film, "To Catch a Thief." Johnson plays Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond, a well-tailored investigator who drives an expensive car, lives in a swinging but upscale London flat, and beds every woman he's interested in. If that sounds like Bond, the resemblance is understandable; Ian Fleming was likely inspired by the fictional Bulldog Drummond mysteries that preceded the Bond books. His quarry here is a two-woman assassination squad (luscious Elke Sommer and kooky Sylva Koscina) that is brutally knocking off contenders for a multi-million-dollar oil deal. Who is really behind the shady goings-on probably won't surprise you, but some of the kinky violence might, even if much here is tame by contemporary standards and already familiar to &quot;The Avengers&quot; fans. "Deadlier Than the Male" works best when it lets the assassins be cold-blooded and Johnson relax and be naturally smooth (as he was in "The Haunting" and numerous other films); it breaks down with its frequently desert-dry, sometimes racist humor and often lethargic, oddly-edited action sequences. Though a climax on a human-sized chessboard is visually impressive, trying to make complete sense of how and why the characters react to it might challenge you. Perhaps the biggest flaw, though, is that despite being suave and handsome, Johnson fails to bring sparks to the romantic scenes; as a female friend told me, "Now I see why he didn't get Bond."

"Star Trek: Generations" is, perhaps, the strangest entry in the annals of the billion-dollar franchise. In an attempt to bridge the Kirk era with the Picard era, the producers created a product that isn't quite either, even if it leans more toward the sterile self-importance of the "TNG" series. The crew of the latest Enterprise encounters Soran, an egomaniacal scientist seeking re-entry into the "Nexus," the same strand of interstellar nirvana that apparently claimed the life of James T. Kirk 75 years earlier. Allied with familiar Klingons, Soran hatches a plot that will kill unseen millions, of course, unless Picard and crew--with the help of a hero well versed in such efforts--can stop him. The set up isn't bad, but the execution often leaves much to be desired. For instance, despite their tiresome reliance on pretentious technobabble (having to witness the great James Doohan spout off such rubbish is especially painful), the gaggle of writers who produced the script offer only the haziest of definitions of just what the Nexus is. What viewers do get is often contradictory--we're told the Nexus is so enrapturing that no one ever wants to leave it, yet Picard and Kirk escape with ridiculous ease. Plot illogic abounds. Apparently, escapees can choose the time and place of their arrival outside of the Nexus; of course, Kirk and Picard choose, perhaps, the worst time and place to confront Soran. (Why can't they just shoot him "Pulp Fiction"-style as he leaves the bathroom?) The "TNG" cast labors through some cringeworthy moments, including a seemingly endless walking-the-plank scene, but Patrick Stewart--a far more warm and charming a fellow in person than he's allowed to be in "Star Trek"--thankfully manages to keep his dignity. William Shatner, doing a bit of an elder John Wayne impression, injects some much-needed energy and charisma into the lethargic film, but Malcolm McDowell is just too creepy to be sympathetic in a role that requires us to not entirely hate him. The special effects are not surprisingly fine, but Dennis McCarthy's score is frequently shrill, a gradual costume changeover is distracting, and some of the editing choices are odd--at least one scene involving Soran and Picard seems to happen too soon in the story. But the worst offender is the handling of Kirk's eventual demise. In what amounts to a 24th-century tumble from what looks like a 19th-century copper mine, the greatest hero of the future is dispatched with all the grandeur of a goldfish being flushed down the toilet. At least one alternate ending floating around the Internet is far better than what we have here.

Thank goodness someone made a good, warm-hearted film about a family--that's pretty much what I thought when I first saw &quot;Soul Food&quot; in the theater in 1997. Like many Americans, I was starved for a movie that didn't portray the American family as broken or malignant, which appears to be the Hollywood standard. &quot;Soul Food&quot; works primarily because it never loses sight of the importance of family, even as its members may bicker or transgress. The plot focuses on the lasting impact of the family matriarch--Big Mama (played wonderfully by Irma P. Hall)--whose kind heart and wise soul holds the family of mostly younger couples together, despite their foibles. When she passes away from complications due to diabetes, her daughters must overcome their differences to uphold the family traditions, best embodied by Sunday dinners that go beyond simple meals. The cast is generally superb, though Vivica Fox and Brandon Hammond (as grandson Ahmad, through whose eyes we are told the story), sometimes try too hard, making their characters border on caricature in a film that otherwise seems so lifelike. There is a subplot involving a hidden family fortune that also gets in the way--writer and director George Tillman, Jr., seems to want to jam as much into the story as possible when he really doesn't have to, as the main plot is interesting enough. These flaws are oddly more apparent on the small screen than they were on the big screen. Nonetheless, &quot;Soul Food,&quot; despite its &quot;R&quot; rating, is an effective family film, one with a sense of authenticity that Hollywood seems to have mostly forgotten.

Negative comparisions to the Roald Dahl text notwithstanding, &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is the last really great movie musical. It's miles beyond the motion-sickness-inducing &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or the thighs-in-your-face &quot;Chicago&quot; and has the charm to delight even the least imaginative of us. The beauty of the film is how well it balances adult cynicism with youthful hope--Dahl's satirical subtexts of European colonialism and slavery (as witnessed by the greed of just about everyone involved and the predicament of the Oopah Loompahs, respectively) are virtually indetectable for children wowed by the colorful production design and memorable songs. So are the swipes against the Germans, common in British films. But the core of the story revolves around Charlie Bucket, the poor but kind-hearted boy whose bleak life with his struggling single mother and invalid grandparents is punctuated only by the occasional ray of sunshine. That he finds the last ticket to compete for a lifetime supply of chocolate is deserved; that he wins against a gaggle of spoiled, obnoxious children that represent the worst of humanity is inevitable. Peter Ostrum and Jack Albertson are terrific as Charlie and Grandpa Joe, respectively, and Gene Wilder inhabits the wily but world-weary Wonka wonderfully. Children (and some adults) sometimes becry the darkness of some scenes, as well as Wilder's often biting reactions to them, but they miss the point: Wonka seeks genuine kindness and decency in a landscape populated mostly by avarice and deceit. To find an heir that possesses such qualities, he must present both the beautiful and the ugly, and act both the benefactor and the villain. It is only through witnessing their reactions--and the rotten kids are never put off by the horrible things they see and do--that he can discover which of them deserves to inherit his fortune. Great songs and uncomplicated special effects add to the air of fantasy that makes this film a winner.

What's remarkable about &quot;Spellbound&quot;--aside from wonderful performances by stars Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck--is that despite its foundation in psychology for plot, it never devolves into the dark, pretentious psychobabble of contemporary films. Instead, the framework of a brilliant man (Peck) suffering from amnesia that results from a murder he may have committed is just that--a framework for what is essentially a mystery-love story. And it works because of Alfred Hitchcock's dream-like direction and the chemistry of its eminently watchable stars. Less film noir and more expressionism, the film delights in a terrific atmosphere of the strange, including a brief but interesting animated sequence by Salvador Dali. Nonetheless, the main characters are always warm and sympathetic. Add Miklos Rosza's elegant score (which will remind some viewers of his work 30 years later on &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot;) and the result is an often overlooked masterpiece from an era of great films.

What's great about "The Edge"--beyond its engaging and literate Ernest-Hemingway-meets-Jack-London storyline--is that it features a good-hearted character that isn't borderine retarded (Forrest Gump), complete fantasy (Superman) or Hollywood camp (Mike and Carol Brady). How refreshing for a contemporary film! Anthony Hopkins is that character, a billionaire named Charles, whose keen intellect and thoughtful nature nonetheless make him a ripe target for his toothy supermodel wife and her photographer lover, Bob (played with just the right amount of oiliness by Alec Baldwin). Even after a surprise birthday party calculated to give him a heart attack fails, Charles joins Bob and others on a plane expedition to find the subject for a photoshoot. Disaster comes in the form of birds that cause the plane to crash in the Alaskan wilderness, setting into motion a chain of conflicts that include being stalked by a man-eating bear and the two men coming to terms with their true natures. Hopkins' little-boy-lost-style of acting is perfect for Charles, who despite his money still suffers from living in a world that values all the wrong things (illustrated nicely when the local innkeeper turns a friendly breakfast conversation into a sales pitch). But it's Lee Tamahori's steadfast direction and David Mamet's tight screenplay that add depth--the themes of good versus evil, thought versus physicality, and honesty versus deceit resonate with both symbol and action. The icing on the cake is Jerry Goldsmith's poignant score, which has just the right combination of nobility and sadness.

Shatner, already reeling from fan outrage at his tongue-in-cheek anti-Trek comments, really took it on the chin for this one. But not deservedly so. Certainly, as far as directing goes, this film is no less pedestrian than the third film, and its humor is no more silly than the fourth. Where it truly suffers is in the special effects department, a fact that in part reveals how empty many modern sci-fi adventures are. The story foolishly blends the first film with a TV episode called &quot;The Way to Eden,&quot; often regarded as one of the worst, with predictable results: Kirk and crew are hijacked by Spock's fanatical half-brother on a religious quest that is ultimately disappointing for everybody involved. While quite a bit in this movie feels incomplete--special effects, Jerry Goldsmith's score, the climax--Shatner and crew manage to muster a few genuine emotions, particularly in scenes revealing the past. Another 15 minutes in the oven and this one might have turned out okay. Widescreen DVD neither helps nor hurts.

&quot;Zulu&quot; is one of those films that should serve as a model for all other films of its genre that follow, and, indeed, it seems to have done just that. If you watch carefully, you'll see images and concepts that reappear--albeit in adapted form--in such films as &quot;Glory,&quot; &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; even if &quot;Zulu&quot; itself will remind you of many &quot;last stand&quot; cavalry and Indian movies made in the U.S. What separates the film most from others is not the technical production, which is impressive, but the relative fairness of the portrayal of both the British and the Zulus. While the story of the battle of Rorke's Drift is told from the point of view of the vastly outnumbered British, the Zulus are never reduced to the often cartoonish level of villain so common in American films. Instead, they are intelligent, organized, and brave adversaries who are, in fact, trying to repel European invaders. (The film successfully avoids the politics of the situation, instead focusing on the plight of the soldiers themselves.) Stanley Baker is stalwart as Chard, an engineer who takes command of the outpost despite his inexperience in combat, and Michael Caine, in his screen debut as the upper-crust second-in-command, has hardly been better. But supporting actors Nigel Greene, as an old guard sargeant, Patrick Magee, as a humane surgeon, and James Booth, as a layabout with criminal tendencies, nearly steal the show. John Barry's impressive score adds just the right mix of African theme and British sensibility, and though there are a few moments that feel dated, the film has stood the test of time since its debut four decades ago. About the only thing to complain about is the barebones DVD, which offers little except a no frills widescreen version of the feature film.

Back before William Hurt became a caricature of himself - back when I was too young to realize how talented he was and thought him so oddly pale that he was difficult to look at - he made a string of critically-acclaimed films that he has not equaled since. Among the earliest was "Gorky Park," the Michael Apted iteration of the best-selling novel by Martin Cruz Smith. This was the early 1980s, when tensions between the United States and the former Soviet Union, what the ruddy-jowled Ronald Reagan so famously called the "Evil Empire," were still strong. For most Americans at the time, the USSR might as well have been Mars; it was an alien country, full of strange-looking people with even stranger customs, a virtual mystery to us except for being the sworn enemy of democracy. So, a film purporting to show the Soviet Union as something other than a bleak place where you could get your throat cut for a roll of toilet paper was a marvel indeed. There is plenty of bleakness in "Gorky Park," of course, from the dour expressions of just about everyone involved to the utilitarian architecture of buildings to the squat patrol cars without heat in the dead of a cold, unforgiving winter. Hurt plays Arkady Renko, the tight-lipped but by contrast almost genial detective assigned to investigate the brutal murder of three unknowns at an outoor ice rink in Gorky Park. I say unknown because the killer has taken the extra precaution of slicing off fingers and faces to conceal their identities. Renko is immediately suspicious that the KGB, under whose scornful eye he operates, is behind the killings until he meets a well-connected American businessman (played by the late, great Lee Marvin) with a demeanor that has "guilty" written all over it. As you might guess, the actual mystery isn't quite as compelling as the way it is told, as Renko, joined later by a vengeful Brian Dennehy, must navigate the maelstrom of political and criminal forces conspiring to thwart him. Hurt is in a word compelling as Renko, with a performance that is mostly about what he doesn't do. He eschews scene-stealing for a minimalist confidence that would be cypher-like from a lesser actor. The rest of the cast is equally gifted, including the feline Joanna Pacula as a sexual confidant who may know more than she's letting on. Her role seems inspired by that of Ingrid Bergman in "Notorious," as does her relationship with Renko. Michael Apted's direction is suitably straightforward (he can drift from greatness, as in "Gorillas in the Mist" to mediocrity, as in "The World is Not Enough") while James Horner's clangy soundtrack, though remisicent of "48 Hours" and "Red Heat" and with more than a few strains of David Bowie and Georgio Moroder, is wonderfully engaging. Look closely and you'll see the Evil Emperor himself, Ian McDiarmid, playing a kooky professor who unveils the identities of the victims.

It's to the much-deserved credit of the underrated George C. Scott--simply brilliant here--and director Franklin Schaffner that the celebrated general of "Patton's" title comes across more the tragic hero and less the right-wing nutjob, especially considering that the film debuted in 1970. "Patton" is worth a look for that bit of storytelling finesse alone, but the film offers much more, effectively examining both the highs and lows of the headstrong general's World War II days. Though it lacks the poetic grandeur of epics like "Lawrence of Arabia" or "How the West Was Won," "Patton" nonetheless operates on a big scale, and Scott's larger-than-life portrayal is never obscured by the production's legions of soldiers or frequent changes of scenery. The script, co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, stays focused on the professional aspects of Patton's life--his devotion to duty, command, and career--and wisely avoids bogging down with diversions into romance or family life. Some might find such an approach imbalanced, but most viewers will likely enjoy the "purity" of what is, for lack of a better term, a satisfying "guy's story." Look for Karl Malden in a great supporting role as Omar Bradley, and enjoy Jerry Goldsmith's bombastic score, rivaled only by John Williams' Indiana Jones overtures. Still, "Patton" is not without faults. Military buffs may bemoan some technical inaccuracies, such as using tanks that don't fit the historical period; at times, the characterizations devolve into caricature, especially that of British General Montgomery; and some of Patton's borderline psychotic behavior--his various rages and obsessions with dreams and reincarnation--seem too easily dismissed as colorful idiosyncracies. The DVD itself is rather bare for a film that received many Oscars, perhaps the biggest flaw of all.

Your age and experiences will likely guide whether you are moved by "Thriller," a 1970s British anthology series that relies more on suspense than shock to entertain. For those of us who prefer suspense -- and perhaps were around when that was de rigeuer -- "Thriller" will be a welcome breath of fresh air to the frenetic but oftentimes pointless "thrillers" that glut the market today. Created by Brian Clemens, best known for his work on the stylish "The Avengers," "Thriller" is really less of a series and more a collection of one-off plays, done in the quirky style of British TV at the time that combined garish video for interior scenes and stark film footage for exterior. The plots, in some cases, are reworkings of thrillers you've seen before, and that's really the only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars. For instance, "An Echo of Theresa" borrows much from "The Manchurian Candidate"; "The Colour of Blood" is in many ways a redux of "Psycho." But there's enough originality to the series, combined with some great guest stars, to make them worth a watch. And certainly the writing is far and away more literate than practically anything on TV today. Look for a great set of British and American actors in the episodes, including Richard Johnson, Paul Burke, and Polly Bergen, as well as a wonderful actor named Dinsdale Landen, who is Stewie from "Family Guy" all grown up and playing a private detective. Look for the requisite twist in every episode, generally done with panache.

Though it borrows greatly from Ernest Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls,&quot; this tense Steve McQueen vehicle pulls few punches in delivering its timely message about the futility of imperialism and war without purpose. The action star gives a brilliant performance as Jake Holman, an American ex-patriate assigned to an all-but-forgotten gunboat patrolling the Yangtze River in the early 1900s. Holman's desire to do right--including treating the Chinese coolies aboard as human beings, rather than latter-day slaves, and helping a good-natured friend (Richard Attenborough) realize his romance for an abused Chinese woman--clashes with the misdirected and often selfish sensibilities of those around him, especially his prideful but immasculated commanding officer (Richard Crenna), leading to a series of tragedies that Holman is powerless to avert. Director Robert Wise, whose films range from brilliant to lackluster, is in top form here, giving &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; a sense of David Lean-esque largesse without ever losing sight of the characters, even in the heat of battle. Jerry Goldsmith's score will stay with you long after the final credits roll. Even with the film's plot about factions in an Asian country opposing foreign attempts to control it a thinly veiled allegory to Viet Nam, &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; never devolves into an Americans-good/Chinese-bad melodrama; like real life, it is often subtle, complex, exhilerating, tragic, and haunting.

Fans of "Gilda" will champion the presence of Rita Hayworth in this highly entertaining film, but Glenn Ford delivers the more important performance. Hayworth, who is lovely, if a bit elbows and feet, naturally gets our attention. leaving Ford to fend for himself while playing a role that goes against the folksy Canadian's type. He looks like an angry Koala bear but manages to pull off a character as hard as flint. This ain't Pa Kent in "Superman." I wouldn't have even thought of him in the role, yet Ford is so good you're tempted to think that he was an inspiration for Ian Fleming's literary James Bond. Hayworth is the titular character, a take-no-prisoners vamp who uses words like weapons and likes to clean her teeth with the bones of the men she's devoured. She marries a shady type -- you know, lives in a mansion but has one of those accents and hair shades that screams "Nazi" -- for his money, and coincidentally, spite, as it turns out that Ballin Mundson has hired Johnny Farrell (Ford), a tough no-accounts gambler, to manage his joint, and Farrell was the one guy who threw her over. It all happens in Buenos Aires, right after World War Two, and if you're already thinking it had shades of "Notorious," you're right, though it also mimics "Casablanca." It's as good as neither, but it often comes close, especially in the sexually-charged one-upping between Gilda and Johnny that, as Munson puts it, revels in its savagery because "hate can be a very exciting emotion." (The truth is, I'm hard-pressed to think of a film I've seen in the last five years whose dialogue is as effortlessly sexy as the writing in "Gilda"; they say the things you wish you could and once in a while do.) There's some claptrap about a tungsten cartel, which is both wonderful in its banality as a plot element and a little distracting as you may chuckle at the thought of the big bad Germans trying to muscle in on the adrenaline-inducing light bulb trade. But, seriously, it's a MacGuffin, as Hitchcock would have put it, and who really cares. The authentic fireworks are between Hayworth and Ford, and they deliver, lashing out at each other in ways that only two people who really love each other can. In fact, this is probably the best romance I've seen this year, a feat made all the more remarkable since there's less to like about Gilda and Johnny than there is to dislike. Admire, maybe. Watch, definitely. The film is directed capably by Charles Vidor, and the score includes the delightful "Put the Blame on Mame," sung several times, including during what is probably the least revealing but best striptease I've ever seen. "Gilda" is one of those classic films that grows on you, and though I've never run out to watch a Glenn Ford or Rita Hawyworth movie, I might just now.

Call it "Dances with Asians" or "Japaneseheart," Edward Zwick's "The Last Samurai" suffers from a near-fatal case of seen-it-before-itis. If the "I haven't figured out the right dose of Ritalin to take yet" presence of Tom Cruise grates on your nerves as much as it does mine, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that he at times gives a measured and even subtle performance as a shell-shocked cavalry officer prostituting himself to teach the Japanese military the brutally efficient techniques of Western warfare. His supporting cast of talented Asian actors is better, though even Ken Watanabe, who at times resembles Lawrence Fishburne in expression and intensity, is no Toshiro Mifune. Where the movie breaks down is with John Logan's shallow script, which like most Western films about the East, implies complexity mostly by making Asians esoteric and tight-lipped; but for all of the posturing, there is no real wisdom offered in a story meant to explore culture clash. Instead, viewers are distracted by battle scenes that probably would have seemed grand had the aforementioned films (with corrected titles), as well as "Gladiator" and "The Last of the Mohicans," not beaten this one to the punch. Zwick even plagiarizes his own film, the much better "Glory," and fans of Hans Zimmer's "The Thin Red Line" soundtrack will be pleased to note that some of it seems to make its way into this film. All in all, "The Last Samurai" isn't a bad film. With an attractive cast and nods to historical authencity, such as ill-fitting uniforms, it's also not bad to look at, even if some suspiciously modern looking powerlines turn up in one scene. It's just that we've seen most of it already.

The late, great Gregory Peck once said that he thought "The Guns of Navarone" was really more of a comedy than a thriller--how else could anyone explain the absurdity of a handful of Allied commandos so ably and resoundingly defeating what appears to be half of the German Army? Well, dramatic identity of the movie aside, Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, and the rest of the stellar cast of "The Guns of Navarone" had a wonderfully atmospheric production built around them, a script that was at times subtle and surprising, and a director in J. Lee Thompson who knew how to mix romanticized, technicolor grandeur with some truly hard-hitting scenes (the discovery of a traitor being but one of them). Unfortunately, the sequel, "Force Ten from Navarone," has none of these things. It benefits somewhat from the presence of Robert Shaw and Edward Fox, who despite being disappointing choices to fill the roles originated by Peck and Niven, do their best with what they have. And that's not much. Whereas "The Guns of Navarone" at least had a script layered with personal motivations and sacrifices for the covert mission, the sequel relies on more workmanlike premises, as the commando team this time simply is thrust into the center of the action. Guy Hamilton, who so ably brought "Goldfinger" and "Funeral in Berlin" to life, nonetheless is content to direct this film as though it were a slightly better-produced television movie and while there are a few nice vista shots, the sweep and imagination of the original is painfully absent. Without a solid production built around them, Harrison Ford and Barbara Bach are woefully uncharismatic, and Franco Nero, as the traitor, compensates by doing everything short of twirling his mustache to let us know he's the villain. The action scenes are, at times, quite riveting, and had "Force Ten from Navarone" not been a sequel, it might not seem so flimsy. But the inevitable comparison to the film it follows is like comparing a child dressed up in a parent's clothes to the actual parent--the basic idea is there, but most of details are underdeveloped or missing.

Writer/Director James Cameron's big breakthrough came in 1984 with this hard-hitting, if derivative, action thriller. More shoot-em-up than sci-fi, the movie manages to combine &quot;Star Trek,&quot; &quot;Westworld,&quot; &quot;The Forbin Project,&quot; &quot;The Naked Prey,&quot; and any number of John Carpenter's early efforts into a low-budget, high-octane chase that pits then unknowns Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn against the ultimate killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the role he was probably destined to play). Nevermind the time-travel underpinnings, &quot;The Terminator&quot; is meant to poke at the visceral parts rather than the thinking ones, and in this regard, it succeeds. The story is simple: machines have taken over the post-apocalyptic future, bent on stamping out the last of humanity. Unable to crush a resistance movement by a few tenacious humans (none of them ethnic minorities . . . apparently, we don't make it into the future), the machines send a cyborg assassin back to 1984 to kill the woman that will mother the leader of the resistance. A human follows the cyborg back in time to save her, with mayhem ensuing. Like so many 1980s movies, the film lightly brushes the story's human relationships, spending the majority of its time focused on the colder technologies and sadistic violence, and there are some fun, if violent, sequences. Hamilton and Biehn make adequate bait for Reagan-era posterboy Schwarzegger, but Paul Winfield and Lance Henrikson deserve more screen time as sympathetic cops. Ultimately, the film may serve best as a pop culture time capsule, reflecting the jingoistic/steroid/WASPy/mall culture that was the Decade of Greed's America. Still, despite its low budget, this is the best of the three Terminator films to date--at least, the one with the least pretensions about itself.

Despite the fact that so many people think &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; is a weakly-plotted Bond film--it's actually one of the more heavily plotted, as the short list of story elements includes, whew, 007's faked death, spaceship hijackings, Ninja training, Bond's &quot;conversion&quot; to being a Japanese man and subsequent &quot;marriage,&quot; and an all-out assault on a volcanic hideout--the film remains one of the most imaginative and breezy of the entire series. As is reasonably well known, Bond goes to Japan to discover who or what is behind spacerace hijinks that are pushing the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of war. He finally comes face-to-face with archnemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (a disappointing Donald Pleasance, who looks but just doesn't quite sound or act the part), but not before sampling the &quot;exotica&quot; that is the Far East. Connery starts to show his age in this one, no longer the lean and mean figure that just two years before graced the screen in &quot;Thunderball,&quot; but a paunchier fellow who nonetheless still looks good in a suit. The supporting cast of mostly Japanese actors is topnotch, despite being rather poorly dubbed--and the two female leads are just plain gorgeous--but it is the toys that start to outshine the human cast, predicting what would become the norm in the later Moore films (two of which, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker,&quot; share both this films' basic story elements and director, Lewis Gilbert). Nonetheless, everything from Nancy Sinatra's lovely theme song to Maurice Binder's striking opening credits sequence to a stunning aerial shot of Bond squaring off against thugs on the deck of a ship to John Barry's pleasant score give this film a supercool 60s feel, making it one of the more consistently stylish, if not more serious, Bond films. Other bits to watch out for: an anonymous, sword-wielding Ninja who gets his moment of glory, a Toyota roadster that appears to be the inspiration for the Mazda Miata, the almost fairy-tale-like villain's lair, and, of course, the helicopter version of Bond's Aston Martin.

Hailed by critics as one of the more important films of the 80s, &quot;Colors&quot; nonetheless is a fairly straightforward tragedy--there's no other direction for the story to take. Robert Duvall plays a veteran police officer working L.A.'s mean streets; hothead Sean Penn joins his CRASH anti-gang unit, predictably testing the elder partner's patience and reserve as he just tries to keep the peace and make it through that final year to retirement. Both actors bring more depth to their cliched roles than might be expected, playing off each other surprisingly well, even in moments where they are given little more to do than react. But &quot;Colors&quot; offers no real answers to anything. The cops are presented mostly as well-armed zookeepers, while the gang members, blessed with youth and health but not much brains, run violently about, making the story mostly a series of aimless confrontations. Art imitating life? Maybe. But careful audiences might feel they've been bamboozled, despite director Dennis Hopper's rather lofty take on it. With some scenes that are genuinely tragic and gripping--the shooting of an unarmed suspect and the movie's final scene, to name two--and a romantic subplot that deserved more time--Maria Conchita Alonso seems to just get warmed up as a bad girl flirting with the notion of being good--&quot;Colors&quot; seems to have more going for it than it really does. Watch it mainly for the performances and the suggestion of complexity.

With the Roger Moore films clearly an influence, "The World is Not Enough" straddles the line between camp and adventure, satire and seriousness, in a largely by-the-numbers adventure that will remind you too much of previous Bonds. Pierce Brosnan returns as 007, not quite as sharp as he was in "Tomorrow Never Dies," but certainly older and with more gadgets. In this one, he teams up with physicist(!) Denise Richards (whose acting style is about as painful as Tanya Roberts' was in the moronic "A View to a Kill") to thwart the evil plans of man-eater Sophie Marceau and her terrorist boyfriend, a completely underused Robert Carlyle. The basic idea is good, but too often the script only makes passing reference to the issues it raises. So, viewers who want to see what happens with a villain that cannot feel pain are expected to be satisfied instead with a standard hand-to-hand fight scene; those anticipating a humanized Bond's wounds to become central to the story will discover they must make due with simply seeing him for a while with an arm sling. Still, the opening teaser sequence is almost worth the price of admission alone, as are the film's score and production values, which are certainly better than those in "Goldeneye." Consider this one miss, a little too far than near.

A terrible thing about the present day is that so many people want to reduce complex ideas or situations to the simplest of notions. Thus, if you're against the War in Iraq, for example, you're unpatriotic or anti-soldier. If you're for it, you're some sort of imperialist or pawn of the robberbarons. Can anything in life be so neatly divided? Ironically, I was reminded of this schism while watching "The Green Berets." On one hand, the film correctly celebrates the bravery and dedication of American soldiers during an era in which many men--including my own father--and women served honorably in our armed forces, even if some, as is always the case with any military throughout history, clearly did not. On the other hand, it's almost pathological determination to sell the Viet Nam War while using cheap dramatic constructs and generally childish assumptions marks it as propaganda of the clumsiest kind. What then to make of it? Well, if you're a John Wayne fan--which I am--the Duke turns in a reasonably enjoyable performance, on par with his solid presence in such classics as "The Longest Day" and "The Sons of Katie Elder," even if he seems too old and out-of-shape for the character he plays. Co-stars Jim Hutton, David Jansen, and George Takei, along with many of Wayne's frequent supporting players, are quite capable, and the production itself--aside from some dicey model work with a helicopter--has a Hollywood gloss. The script and direction (for which Wayne shares some of the responsibility), on the other hand, often come up short. An attack on a base camp, for instance, is suitably dramatic, but soon after the battle is lost at great expense by the Green Berets and South Vietnamese civilians, a short strafing run eliminates the enemy, leaving viewers to wonder if a tactical evacuation of the camp without the costly battle might have been a wiser course of action in the first place. The script also is compelled to introduce one tragedy after another, most of which focus on the plight of a young Vietnamese boy (even if his name and others are typical Hollywood gibberish for Asian terms and nomenclature). "Ham Chuk's" home, belongings, parents, dog, and American surrogate father all fall victim to the war, leaving viewers to scratch their heads when the Wayne character reassures the boy at the end that the Americans are there to help people like him--just how much more help of this kind can the poor kid take? Even the actual combat scenes, while sometimes gruesome for the day, seem rather juvenile, as the film takes a laughably cowboys-and-Indians approach to many scenes. If watched as a pseudo-western with stock characters and fantasy ideas about real life, "The Green Berets" is palatable; if viewed as actual commentary about the war, it's a lot harder to take.

One of the few films I've seen where a sex scene is actually justified, "Don't Look Now" is also an eerily effective, if quiet thriller that features topnotch acting by stars Christie and Sutherland. The two play grieving parents who are haunted psychologically--and, apparently, spiritually--by the drowning death of their daughter. Adapted from a novel, it is a refreshingly literate film that unfolds in an unhurried, yet palpably brooding manner interspersed with scenes of genuine affection between its stars; the aforementioned sex scene is graphic even by today's standards, yet emotionally and thematically honest. (Sutherland and Christie, looking especially lovely, are completely believable as two married people, but more importantly as two people in love.) Still, effective as they are, scenes like these sometimes clash with the film's more Gothic sensibilities about the paranormal, and combined with the muted, 70s-style cinematography, make it feel unintentionally disjointed. Adults will find the deliberate pace and sometimes jumpy editing intriguing, but anyone looking for a cheap scare should look elsewhere.

The most literate and character-driven Star Trek film, this second outing takes the series to a level not yet repeated. An aging Kirk goes head-to-head with old nemesis Khan (played with convincing wrath by Montalban) in a multi-layered story that ultimately forces him to confront his own flaws and mortality. Moreover, secondary characters, particularly Spock, shine in moments that may actually bring a tear to your eye. Superb special effects, a suitably nautical score by Horner, a wonderfully subdued tone marred only by occasional corniness, and a bravo performance by Shatner make this one a must-see. Although the DVD lacks extra scenes (strangely, shown on TV several times), the widescreen view allows your eye to savor details, even director Meyer's typical anachronistic ones (check out the "no smoking" sign and obvious 20th-century fire extinguishers.).

That the series took a comedic turn with Star Trek IV is well known, though the 80s-style humor seems a bit forced and dated now (punk rocker, Russians, etc.). Nimoy's second turn at directing is more imaginative than his first Trek, even if this one suffers occasionally from stock characters and a case of the "cutes." Star Trek IV delivers on most fronts--good dialogue, decent special effects, competent acting. The plot is recycled sci-fi: Kirk and crew timewarp to save Earth from a menace that's never quite explained or explored. Along the way, they deliver a heavy-handed message about ecology and have some misadventures. Leonard Rosenman's asymetric score will make you pine for Goldsmith and Horner, and Catherine Hicks is at times grating and juvenile, but there's some genuine warmth here. Widescreen also makes this look like a movie, rather than a big TV show. Basically completes a story that took three films and five years to finish.

Rumbling to life like the mechanical men that invade a fantasy New York City of the past, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is the kind of rip-snorting adventure that, dare I say it, they just don't make anymore.That said, it's far from perfect, with stale and predictable writing and leads Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow being not quite charismatic enough to distract us from watching the production, itself at once both truly amazing and irritatingly familiar. In fact, it's pretty easy to see the influences on "Sky Captain" -- from those that are acknowledged, like "Buck Rogers," to those that aren't, like "The Mysterians," "The Wizard of Oz," Max Fleischer's "Superman" cartoons, "When Worlds Collide," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Gerry Anderson's various TV series, and more.As derivative as it is, "Sky Captain" unfolds with an exuberant, child-like grace. No, we don't really believe that a tricked-out P-40 can do all of the things that this one can, any more than we believe that dead Lawrence Olivier was somehow resurrected for one more role. But the first half hour of "Sky Captain" is so fast-paced, cut and framed like a bona fide film from the 1930s, that it's easy to forgive the lapses in reason - or the standard effort to make a female character "strong" by making her mouthy and impulsive or a male character sensitive by having him put up with it. Eventually, the film's editing and pacing synch up with more contemporary films, which is a shame, really.The plot is relatively simple, if hard to swallow: giant robots begin looting cities while a team of scientists, each connected to a mysterious inventor named "Totenkopf," are assassinated one by one. When all else fails, Sky Captain (Law, looking like the love child of Timothy Dalton and Ewan MacGregor) and his private air force are called in, reuniting the hero with - great Caeser's ghost - a plucky reporter (big-footed Paltrow) a former lover (sexy, one-eyed Angelina Jolie), and his inventor friend, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi, here a poor man's Mickey Rooney). Of course, the mystery sends them globetrotting, and what they find may make them wish they could just click their heels and be home again.The best thing about "Sky Captain" is the production design, which is a marvel of computer-generated sets and gadgets mixed in with live action from the cast. Director and writer Kerry Conran definitely has more of an eye for the look of the film than for the script, as he falls into the standard contemporary motif of having characters who should be working together nonetheless (yawn) bicker in the most absurd of situations. In this film, it's a "Star Wars"-like race through dangerous corridors of air space framed by Gotham's skyscrapers. And, like a lot of other filmmakers today dodging the pesky issues of a lack of diversity/stereotyping in their works, he gets mileage out of setting the film in the past and making Asians and thinly-veiled Nazis the bad guys -- you know, just like many U.S. and British films of the period.Nonetheless, "Sky Captain" is worth a look, though be warned: If you don't fall immediately in love with Ed Shearmur's "Sky Captain" theme, you'd better put a bucket over your head and hit it with a wooden spoon `cause that ditty's pretty much played all through the film.

It's ironic that the western, a staple of TV until sci-fi eclipsed its presence, would find its home again on the small screen during a time when big budget westerns seemed to be biting the dust to space opera blockbusters. And that it would take an Australian to realize it. Director Simon Wincer's big-vista understanding of the genre is apparent throughout &quot;Lonesome Dove,&quot; which also features some great performances by screen familiars Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, even if the latter too often looks like a scowling Kenny Rogers here. This tale of an arduous cattle drive by two retired lawmen has the sweep and grist of such classics as &quot;True Grit,&quot; &quot;Red River,&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; with which it shares many elements (the conversational style, the brutal drive, and the buddy relationship, respectively, the most obvious). And while &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; doesn't really say anything new about the old west, it is entertaining and fares better compared to many westerns past in terms of presenting the ethnic diversity that history records. Look for many bravura--and few corny--moments like Captain Call's (Jones) reaction to a cavalry scout's whipping of Call's alleged son (a likable but sometimes too aw-shucks Rick Shroeder), MacCrae's (Duvall) gutsy stand against a pack of outlaws, and the touching and remarkably in-character last goodbye between the leads. Basil Poledouris, an underrated composer, provides a solid score. Of the episodes, only one stands out as pedestrian, making this a pretty good choice for viewers who want to savor their entertainment choice.

As with "Kill Bill, Volume 1," Quentin Tarantino shows his maturation as a bonafide filmmaker--here, he takes familiar themes from westerns and embeds them in a story that rises above the usual action movie fare. In the second half of the tale of "The Bride" (revealed here finally to be "Beatrix Kiddo" in a scene that features an even more witty screen name), Tarantino and star Uma Thurman explore the ramifications of her revenge. At stake are the lives of her innocent daughter and the nefarious Bill, played with terrific, snakelike charisma by David Carradine, who hasn't been this good since TV's "Kung Fu." (People familiar only with the silly 90s TV sequel really missed out on this talented--and under-utilized--actor's ability to carry a scene.) Featuring the great Gordon Liu (seen briefly in the first film), the always oily Michael Madsen, and that other blonde virago, Darryl Hannah, the supporting cast is topnotch, but once again, it's Tarantino's sense of vision that dominates, even if he lifts quite a few images from elsewhere. Check out "homages" to John Ford's "The Searchers," for instance, as referenced in a broken-down trailer. And, as with the previous film, there are great music bits, only some of which, sadly, make it to the soundtrack CD. Fans expecting the faster pace and over-the-top violence of the first film may be disappointed, but those able to get involved in the characters' plights may discover that this film actually delivers a bit more than its predecessor.

At times plodding and overwrought--the line about "heat" itself is rather clumsy--"Heat" nonetheless is an entertaining cops and robbers thriller that benefits from the contrast between leads Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. These heavy hitters from the 1970s finally get to meet onscreen in a scene that is delightful for being so underplayed. Director Michael Mann, whose magnificent retelling of "The Last of the Mohicans" set a new standard for action films, is in fine visual form here; his camerawork is crisp and confident, and he relies on his signature "slow burn" shots and music to carry much of the emotional punch. With Sergio Leone and Peter Yates obvious influences--the ending of the film alone seems taken right out of "Bullitt"--Mann sometimes also dips into "Miami Vice" territory with the pacing of "Heat"; what works on TV, though, doesn't always work in film, and here there are a few too many "talking head" scenes that slow the film down. The story is relatively simple: a gang of bank robbers is tracked by an obsessed cop after turning the streets of downtown Los Angeles into a war zone. Along the way, the film explores buddy and romantic relationships, culminating in a chase that is correctly the focal point of these entanglements. Co-stars Val Kilmer, John Voight, and Amy Brenneman are capable, but it's pretty clear that DeNiro and Pacino are the stars. The barebones DVD leaves a bit to be desired, though it fares better than the director's cut of "The Last of the Mohicans," which wasn't really an improvement over the theatrical version of the film.

Those of us who teach for a living enjoy a guilty pleasure in &quot;The Substitute.&quot; While we'd never dream of ever harming any of our students--well, at least I'd never dream of it--the catharsis from a fiction about a good guy mercenary cleaning house of all the bad influences in an urban high school--violent punks, drug lowlifes and sociopath gangbangers and the evil adults who indulge their self-destruction--is just too wonderful to pass up. Tom Berenger eschews the angry racist persona he brought to life so ably in &quot;Platoon&quot; for a different man of action, in this case, Shales, a professional soldier with a heart and a brain. Besieged and assaulted by teenybopper thugs who work for the local drug kingpin, his teacher girlfriend turns to the only man who might be able to stop them, forcing Shales to go undercover as a substitute teacher to root out the source of the problems. While the script is fantasy and has very little to do with teaching, and the production values are on the &quot;B&quot; side, the able cast--including Ernie Hudson, William Forsythe, Richard Brooks, and many other familiar faces--plays it with just the right amount of humor and zeal. Director Robert Mandel infuses the production with a pace and wit that has helped other low-budget productions make it to cult status (think &quot;Alligator&quot;), and &quot;The Substitute&quot; deserves an audience. If you teach, put this one on your shelf for those days when you feel like you could use a mercenary to put some order back into the classroom for you!

I'm pretty leery of remakes, especially remakes of films or TV shows that were pretty good the first time around. The television series that serves--barely--as the model for this overbudgeted, underdeveloped redux was one of the best fantasy concepts ever (007 meets "Bonanza"), a showcase for the dynamite team of supercool Robert Conrad and charming Ross Martin. Director Barry Sonnenfeld just doesn't seem to get it. His first mistake was casting one-trick-pony Will Smith in the Conrad role; reimagining James West as a "person of color" was a great idea (Conrad himself had suggested Jackie Chan), but Smith's lackluster presence and incessant mugging for the camera grow tiresome, as usual, after five minutes. Kevin Kline as master-of-disguise Artemus Gordon is more inspired but instead of letting him be a member of an elite team, the script makes him West's cranky rival for too long in the film. It's like watching Archie and Reggie in cowboy hats but without the action and suspense. While his Dr. Loveless lacks the winning combination of pathos and villainy that Michael Dunn brought to the TV role, Kenneth Brannagh, at least, seems to be having fun as the requisite egomaniacal genius. The plot is, by and large, a mess--something about gunrunning, Ulysses S. Grant, and giant, steam-powered spiders; somehow, in two hours, Sonnenfeld manages to convey a story with less flair, delight, and imagination than a single hour of the TV series. Cold and flat computer-generated effects are no match for the simpler but more atmospheric production values of the series and like most recent remakes, the production crew seems to have a shallow understanding of the source material. Even Elmer Bernstein's score is a hollow approximation of the TV series' excellent theme music.

Sidney Poitier - like Gregory Peck, Cary Grant, Toshiro Mifune, and others of a bygone era - is an iconic movie star. Smart, talented, handsome, he's unique in this age of mostly interchangeable "actors" who star in the latest noisy but forgettable big-budget videogame or special effects extravaganza. His early films, such as the delightful "Lilies of the Field," showcased his obvious charisma, and by the time he graduated to light dramas like "To Sir, with Love," he was a bonafide leading man. But, oddly, his career seemed to zenith by the early 1970s, when "The Organization," one of two sequels to the Oscar-winning "In the Heat of the Night," continued the efforts of Virgil Tibbs, a clean cut police detective often fighting social injustice as much as outright crime, this time in San Francisco. He's pulled into a drug war, when a group of hardnosed idealists steal millions in heroin inadvertently from the mob and then try to use the theft to bring the leaders into the open. While "The Organization" lacks the ballast of the first film, it has enough twists and turns to merit as a thriller, with a look and feel inspired more by the superior Steve McQueen vehicle "Bullitt" than the 1967 film in which Poitier sparred with police chief Rod Steiger over racial politics while investigating a murder in a southern town. The acting is, of course, stagier than the "naturalistic" style of today, yet with few distractions from excessive violence or foul language, the film seems much more authentic. Look for familiar faces like Raul Julia and Daniel J. Travanti showing up in smaller roles - homelier in their youth than people might recall when they later became stars - but it's Poitier who makes it all work. Since so much of the 1970s has returned to fashion, viewers might also enjoy digesting what inspired today's "contemporary" look.

Well, it won't take 1,000 words to sum up this movie: junk. It's hard to view "Body of Evidence" even as a guilty pleasure--there's just way too much guilt. Madonna plays a scheming, Betty Davis-esque golddigger (surprise) who destroys men by oversexing them with her body! Willem Dafoe, the lawyer hired to defend her against charges of murdering her elderly, rich husband, may be her next target. The story is so purile it makes "The Days of Our Lives" look like Shakespeare, and the film wastes just about every likable performer in it (including Joe Mantegna, Ann Archer and Dafoe). Perhaps the biggest mistake is letting Madonna do more than be filmed without clothes--she delivers her lines about a beat too slow and often looks uncomfortable in her own skin. (It doesn't help that Madonna often is made up to appear ten years older than she is--she looks hotter now in her music videos). Pick anything at random starring Amazonian Shannon Tweed from the bargain basement video bin, and you'll probably be more entertained than you will from watching this waste of celluloid.

"The January Man" is an offbeat thriller for adults -- it's as if a Sherlock Holmes movie were made by the writers of "Seinfeld" after watching "Breakfast at Tiffany's."The always pleasant and underused Kevin Kline stars as Nick, a disgraced police detective reluctantly put back into service to track down a serial killer whose MO relies on a baffling series of logical quirks. Along the way, we meet his upwardly mobile ex-girlfriend (Susan Sarandon), now married to his generally unlikable brother (Harvey Keitel), the mayor he works for (Rod Steiger), and the mayor's daughter (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). Danny Aiello and Alan Rickman round out the cast, as Nick's hostile police superior and artist best friend respectively. The cast is without fail entertaining and works hard to create strong characters.The movie's greatest strength is also the one thing that will most annoy some audiences -- it invests a lot more in the characters than the plot. In this, "The January Man" is much more a lighthearted drama than a serious thriller, and if you're looking for the latter, there are far better movies in the genre, "The Silence of the Lambs" perhaps the best example. On the other hand, if you want to watch a movie that actually takes the time to develop its characters, this may be the one for you. In fact, I was actually hoping there would be more on them because of how the sincere investment works, and that's the movie's only real flaw.Take, for instance, the scene where Kline seduces Mastrantonio or, perhaps, where she allows herself to be seduced. After following her from a funeral to ice skating (it works better on screen than it sounds), his moment of complete honesty at her urging about his desire for her is the one thing she might hear to agree to sleep with him. How the scene turns out, including the un-formulaic behavior of the characters, has a ring of grown-up truth to it, if you've walked this planet enough years and found yourself in situations you'd never dreamed of being in. But audiences looking for a standard Hollywood resolution will likely be shaking their heads instead.Norman Jewison's steady direction never interferes with the unfolding of the story nor relies on the sorts of visual distractions that movies with even less plot and characterization must turn to today to keep the audience's attention. There is something very 1960s in the way the characters are conceived and something very 1970s in the way the story is told, even if it is a product of the late 1980s. Except for the music and fashion and some computer nonsense, one might believe it had been made a decade before. These, again, may seem to work against each other, but actually give the film more dimension than many made after 1980.

"Traffic" is one of those films whose message seems so timely and important that people overlook that it is mostly bits and pieces cobbled together as a story. Soderburgh--who actually managed to do a remake as good as the original with "Ocean's 11--almost seems anti-narrative with his take on the futile U.S. war on drugs. He struggles to tell several stories at once, the most compelling of which is set in a Mexico that looks more like Mars, as it was filmed through a filter that gives everything an orangish wash. (Soderburgh relies on this gimmick for each story's setting--my hometown, Columbus, looks a lot grayer than it does in real life). Here, Benicio Del Torro shines as a cop with murky ethics who nonetheless finds himself surrounded by even more questionable public officials. Though the semi-documentary approach seems sincere, there is little in "Traffic" movie-goers haven't seen in one form or another in "Miami Vice" or "Scarface," save for a venomous Catherine Zeta-Jones as an amoral soccer mom determined to hold onto the good life after her drug-dealer husband is sent up. A particularly ugly--but, sadly, all-too-real--subtext is that there is no drug problem until it reaches the affluent white suburbs, as incoming anti-drug Czar and wantonly oblivious father Michael Douglas finally snaps into action when he discovers his preppie daughter is actually a junkie bottoming out. With the film's arthouse approach and shaky plot, viewers expecting answers will mostly find questions, not all of which, unfortunately, are worth asking dramatically.

When Clive Owen's name was bandied about to replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, the only word I could think of to describe Owen was "meathead." Having now seen "Croupier," I understand a bit more why he was considered, as it's fairly clear that the 007 from the opening casino scenes in "Dr. No" was a model for Owen's look and performance here, right down to the way he dangles his cigarette. Still, he lacks that final ingredient of panache, looking a bit more like a slightly less dopey but more hairy Nicholas Cage than a young Connery. His sociopathic performance here, too, lacks significant depth, though it is appropriate for the muted goings on that is "Croupier's" plot. As a frustrated writer searching for his muse, Owen's Jack is pulled into myriad scenes depicting the sad state of the controlled and controlling that comprises the gambling world, itself a thinly veiled metaphor for society in general. The first half of the film may remind viewers of "Fight Club" in both tone and execution; by the time the story takes some twists -- at least one unexpected -- it seems a different animal. The performances here are good, especially from Alex Kingston, whose South African accent and desire to get naked are both plusses. But by the middle of the film, it's not clear whether what we are seeing is real or some fantasy conjured up by "Jake," Jack's steely alter ego. In the end, it doesn't seem to matter, as "Croupier" reaches for and basically attains the sort of muddled climax that intellectuals find thought provoking. If you've seen enough of these things, you won't be surprised.

Watching "Crush" is like seeing a really pretty house from the distant roadside, only to drive up and realize it's actually a hastily painted shack that somehow lured you over. The first half is reasonably engaging, as we follow the anxious exploits of a 40-something headmistress (played with sincerity by modeling's most famous plainjane, Andie McDowell) who falls first in lust and then in love with a man 15 years her junior. Their romance survives a series of trials and tribulations, including the general disapproval of the locals, but not the interference of her suspicious friends, one a sweet but mousy cop and the other a pushy doctor whose mean-spirited plan to out the boyfriend as a philanderer leads to senseless tragedy. Getting a handle on just what the movie is saying is tough--on one hand, it's about eschewing convention for true love, but, alas, that never actually happens, as the romance ends abruptly. There are the expected and cliched nods to sisterhood, motherhood, and the joys and pains of living, as well as a creepy subtext that men are really only necessary for sex and procreation. (Driving the point rather clumsily home is the fact that the doctor, a masculine horse of a woman, comes to realize she doesn't need men at all; her character also plays into a rather ugly sexual stereotype.) There's nothing particularly wrong about the performances, cinematography or the score of "Crush," but the film suffers from relying too much on semi-realized moments of female bonding to make up for a story that goes off in several directions without really getting anywhere. In the end, "Crush" wants to be a "chick flick," with some tears and some laughs (and even a happy ending that feels forced); the problem is, in the end, that's all that it is.

I agree with many of the reviewers about the poor quality of the image in this DVD, but not about the quality of the content of "How the West Was Won." A bonafide epic, the film features an all-star cast that never disappoints, and there are a variety of moments in the film that are truly inspiring and magnificent. What damages viewing enjoyment is a combination of a washed-out print and the attempt to retain the film's original aspect ratio by leaving in vertical lines where the Cinerama process would have allowed the image to "wrap" wider than a normal movie screen. Both of these problems could have been fixed with some relatively simple computer processes, but it appears that the DVD manufacturer simply found an old print of the film and digitized it as is. (I've noticed, too, that the DVD doesn't always play well in my player, skipping quite a bit.) That's a shame because "How the West Was Won" is a grandiose exercise--an attempt to tell the story of European expansion into the West through the eyes of several generations of a single family. Narrated by the great Spencer Tracy and starring the likes of Gregory Peck, Debbie Reynolds, Karl Malden, Jimmy Stewart, and others, it's a treat for anyone who enjoys "classic" cinema. It certainly was good enough for Ron Howard and Kevin Costner to rip off, er, be inspired by its scenes for some of their films. What the manufacturer did do correctly, however, was retool the sound, so that Alfred Newman's (not the Mad magazine character) magnificent score sounds as robust and haunting as its supposed to. True, the film glorifies a chapter in American history defined as much by greed, racism, and violence as it was by pioneerism, bravery, and sacrifice, but there's enough about the human spirit in "How the West Was Won" to temper its fairly narrow point-of-view about who really built this country and why. If nothing else, it certainly reinforces the sense of community among mainstream Americans, as it taps into the typical mores, but squint hard enough and you might even see some people of color.

This well-meaning but flawed film purports to be about the life and times of Bruce Lee, the intense, talented actor and martial artist who died tragically all too young. There is dispute over the biographical truth of the film, which is really neither here nor there, as the film seems far less interested in delving into Lee's biography than it does walking a strange line between drama and melodrama. Though he doesn't much resemble the real-life Bruce Lee, star Jason Scott Lee tries hard to capture the actor's raw power and charisma, with mixed results. He's best in the film's quieter moments, when the sincerity of his face gives the film much-needed grounding, and worst when his frenetic facial expressions and frequent shouting border on camp. But this probably isn't Lee's fault, as the film itself drifts in and out of wanting to be taken seriously and wanting to be a pseudo-chopsocky matinee, all to an often-syrupy music score. Co-star Lauren Holly is believable as Lee's caucasian wife, who struggles with him against racism that comes from so many in society--even her own mother. It is here that the film works best, illustrating the humiliation and degradation of anti-Asian racism that Lee, who simply wants to be recognized as the American he is, endures from fellow Americans, even after achieving his fame. A particularly clever--and dead-on accurate--scene reveals the isolation and thoughtless prejudice that Asian Americans frequently face: amidst a crowd of whites roaring with laughter, Lee quietly suffers Mickey Rooney's grotesque yellowface characterization in the critically-acclaimed "Breakfast at Tiffany's." Had the film focused more on meaningful emotional pyrotechnics like these, rather than the frequent, goofy interplay between Lee and a symbolic Mongol warrior, it might have captured the essence of the man instead of his onscreen persona. Like "Boogie Nights," it would have risen above the obvious exploitive qualities of its subject matter.

Compared to the "family" garbage that Hollywood regularly chucks out like McDonalds bags to the suburban roadside today--the Rugrats, Spy Kids, etc.--"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" is one or those rare gems that sports both a superb cast and a great story. Terribly underrated as a musical (several songs are quite good, and the score overall is lush), what separates it most from the celluloid fertilizer that stinks up the local cineplex is that the family here truly is held together by love and kindness. Thus, there are no wise-... kids thinking they're smarter than the adults, no adults whose selfish pursuits blind them to everyone else's needs, no cynicism to poison children too young to realize yet that life, indeed, can be quite enjoyable. Instead, this whimsical story about a kind-hearted, if daffy inventor who resurrects for his children a hunk of junk into a kid-friendly version of the car from "Goldfinger" (no coincidence--Ian Fleming wrote this story, too.) delights with its good center. Along the way, the family, joined by the beautiful daughter of a local candy magnate, is transported to a magical kingdom where children are illegal. If your family life was a trainwreck, you just won't get the sweetness of it all, but for those of us who had truly loving parents, the film resonates (even if there are typical overtones of British ethnocentrism and one or two risque lines). The only real problem is that the widescreen version is not available--what blockhead decided to release it in scan-and-pan?

Until recently a mediocre effort that seemed a redux of the show that immediately preceded it, "Star Trek: Voyager," "Star Trek: Enterprise" squanders a big budget and generally watchable cast in its first season, though a few episodes rise above pedestrian. A completely miscast Scott Bakula, so likable in "Quantum Leap" but so wooden and ineffective here, struggles to bring to life Jonathan Archer, perhaps the blandest commanding officer in "Star Trek's" 40-year history. It doesn't help Bakula that the writers aren't sure who the guy is. His supporting cast--including Connor Trinneer as a folksy engineer, Jolene Blalock as the 22nd century's version of Mr. Spock, John Billingsley as a terrific alien physician, Jeffrey Combs as a feisty, blue-skinned ally, and Vaughn Armstrong as an admiral who shows up in quite a few episodes--is much better, though the actors often aren't given much to do. Still, they fare better than the rest of the cast, which seems consigned mostly to pushing buttons or supporting in the lamest of ways "Star Trek's" commitment to ethnic and racial diversity. (But let's be honest--most of the world's population is Asian, and none of the series has even shown anything remotely like the reality of the world's population or what it might be in the future.) Purporting to be a prequel series, "Star Trek: Enterprise" only occasionally seems authentic or even respectful of the original "Star Trek" and aesthetically, it has much more in common with the plasticky tedium of the newer shows. Episodes worth watching include "The Andorian Incident," "Silent Enemy," "The Shadows of P'Jem," and "Shuttlepod One," but for some bizarre reason, the producers decided to toss in the distraction of time travel in some episodes, something obviously new to people in the first series.Not surprisingly, under new creative leadership, the show improved markedly this past year and now is starting to genuinely feel like a prequel. Even Bakula finally seems to be warming up to his role. Had the show been as strong out of the gate, it probably would have found a substantial audience. But the damage has already been done, and the dwindling ratings and news of cancellation speak for themselves. Too bad. Don't believe the spin about "franchise fatigue" from the people who bungled this series--there's still a healthy audience for "Star Trek." It's just that the audience wants good "Star Trek."

A crisply photographed showboat, "The Wind and the Lion" is at times off-kilter dramatically, especially when it awkwardly mixes a fascination with brutality with a flirtation with camp. The opening sequence is a perfect example: as the berbers slash and rampage through Tangier's streets and houses, writer/director John Milius injects the too-stoic last stand of an Englishman and an odd slapstick scene involving a horse and the local chieftan (Sean Connery, who sometimes is impressive and sometimes just doesn't seem to be trying that hard). It doesn't help that co-star Candice Bergen demonstrates a more limited range here than she did years earlier in "The Sand Pebbles" or would years later in "Murphy Brown"; there are few sparks between her and the former James Bond. Milius has much better success with the scenes involving Brian Keith as Teddy Roosevelt--the star of "Family Affair" is simply a delight as the feisty but thoughtful U.S. President. The best thing about "The Wind and the Lion" as a whole is the careful attention to detail, such as the hairstyles and uniforms, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is suitably lush, even if strains sound like his "Klingon theme" from Star Trek. And though he relies on too many close-ups of horse's legs or small numbers of people standing in for crowds during action, Milius musters some impressive battle scenes and military paraphrenalia, re-creating an often overlooked period of history with a sense of both romance and authenticity.

Like many of Ridley Scott's films, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; functions best as style over substance. Based on the sadly true story of a 1993 U.S. military operation gone sour in Somalia, the film nonetheless feels devoid of much plot or character: it's mostly a lot of combat in the cavalry-surrounded-by-Indians vein, some of it gripping, some not. In terms of execution, it's reminiscent of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (and the last 20 minutes of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;). However, things worked better in the D-Day film (which also featured Tom Sizemore and was filmed in a similar high-contrast style) because Spielberg worked harder to establish his characters, stock as they were, so we'd care about their ultimate fates. But other than some macho "styling and profiling" scenes early in this film, there's not much effort to differentiate the soldiers here, who for the most also look irritatingly the same with their gear and shaved heads. Because the characters feel more or less like extensions of the military equipment, like toy soldiers on the kitchen table, many of the film's "emotional" scenes lack punch. Oscar-caliber acting, therefore, is neither required nor expected, and the cast of mostly young faces--Ewan MacGregor, Josh Hartnett, William Fichtner, and others--delivers what is necessary and not much more, with wrinkly Sam Shepherd his usual cowboy self. What keeps &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; alive is how the soldiers' predicament goes from bad to worse; what keeps your attention is the verisimilitude of the fighting scenes, particularly in the last half of the film, though, again, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; scores higher in most regards. That leaves a collage of scenes that are too stylized to be documentary and too "realistic" to be a standard Hollywood outing. Based as it is on real events, the film still reduces conflicts to their most simplistic level--the technological might of the U.S. soldiers versus the wily determination of the enemy mobs; the streetsmart blue-collar grunts versus the incompetent egghead analysts in charge; the nearly all-white soldiers versus the all-black hordes of Somalis, etc. Though composer Hans Zimmer repeats a lot from The Thin Red Line, much of the music fits, even the requisite pop songs. The mixed result is a passable war film that, at least, tries to honor the memory of those who died, even if we never really get to know most of these men in meaningful ways.

Most spy movies of the last 20 years are pure garbage--videogames and dim-witted action films that never really get past a shallow understanding of the chessgame that is espionage. "Ronin" is refreshingly complex and thoughtful, a throwback to efforts like "Golden Earring" and "The Counterfeit Traitor" but with some contemporary sensibilities. Robert DeNiro gives a terrific, world-weary performance as a retired CIA operative who joins a ragtag team of mercenaries and former spies brought together for a heist (in the best Hitchcockian sense, it doesn't really matter what they're after). No one trusts anyone, and no one is supposed to get to know anyone else, but DeNiro's spy strikes up a cautious friendship with one of the team (Jean Reno, in a sensitive performance that one-ups his strong turn in "The Professional"). But as good as they are, they are upstaged by Stellan Skarsgard's villain, a paunchy, pinched-faced doublecrosser who looks more like an alcoholic accountant than a deadly gun-for-hire. Jonathan Pryce, Sean Bean, Michael Lonsdale, and Natascha McElhone are other familiar faces in this excellent cast. Director John Frankenheimer, who preferred more character-driven thrillers to dopey action flicks, nonetheless packed this film with some serious high-octane chases and gun battles, and he was probably the only director besides the Coen Brothers and Stanley Kubrick to actually understand how to use the steady cam. The on-location production values are richly textured--we probably haven't gotten to know European vistas this well since the early days of the James Bond films--and their seediness adds just the right grit to a story meant to prick us with its hard edge. Viewers (and reviewers) expecting something as vapid as a Tom Cruise or Will Smith vehicle probably won't get "Ronin's" grounded sensibilities, but for now, it's the closest thing we get to a literary spy thriller on the screen.

The late, great George C. Scott does a fine turn as a widower judge who thinks he's Sherlock Holmes in &quot;They Might Be Giants,&quot; a film that proves Scott easily could have played the fictional detective in a straight adaptation of Conan Doyle's mysteries, too. The film takes great delight in lampooning the establishment of the day--no surprise, as it debuted in 1971--with particular attention on cutting down to size the burgeoning mental health industry. Joanne Woodward is charming as a psychiatrist and social misfit, appropriately named Dr. Watson, who teams up with Scott to track the nefarious Moriarity, only to discover love and destiny instead. Along the way, they are joined by a battalion of New York City's cataways, including laconic Jack Gilford, a young M. Emmet Walsh, F. Murray Abraham with an afro, and even Paul Benedict, the fellow who would go on to fame as &quot;Mr. Bentley&quot; of television's &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; fame. Though it has an atypical but beguiling score by John Barry and some very tender moments courtesy of screenwriter James Goldman (Gilford's affinity for swashbuckling and Watson's doomed attempt at a romantic dinner among them), &quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; sometimes suffers from a lack of thematic focus that rivals the mania of its main characters. A slapstick scene in a grocery store seems tonally wrong in a film that otherwise takes the high road of satire rather than the low road of farce. (Apparently, it was originally excised from the film, only to return in a later version, though I recall seeing the film on TV as a child in the 70s, and the grocery store scene was intact.) Commentary by the film's director, Anthony Harvey, is worth noting, though the man interviewing him dodges the most obvious question burning in the mind's of viewers--exactly what is one to make of the film's ending?

Less a shoot 'em up than a Cold War spy thriller, "Firefox" is an earnest effort that nonetheless yields mixed results. On one hand, the premise and pacing are decidely adult--this is supposed to be a throwback to the better spy thrillers of the 60s, where the action is tempered by chess-like moves and countermoves rather than comic-book-style quick solutions. But like so many 80s films, "Firefox" sometimes compromises its vision, pandering to the lowest common denominator by offering cheesy, jingoistic lines and special effects sequences in place of further character or plot development. Eastwood is well cast as Mitchell Gant, a shell-shocked American pilot sent to steal a prototype Soviet plane that threatens to upset the arms balance. The longer--and more interesting--part of the movie concerns Gant's journey behind the Iron Curtain, as well as his meeting with dissidents prepared to help him. Here, "Firefox" functions well as a thriller, offering genuine suspense and pathos, especially for the team of scientists prepared to sacrifice their lives to see his mission succeed. The actual theft of the plane and subsequent cat-and-mouse aerial antics, however, seem rather one-note by comparison: there are too many repetitious moments in the cockpit and the various control centers, where people pour over maps and radar screens while looking pensive. The acting is generally fine, but the script seems to run out of things for everyone to do--after all, Gant's basically just piloting a plane while everyone is trying to figure out where he's going. Even the climactic fighter battle lacks a sense of genuine tension, partly because characterization drops out and partly because the outcome already seems decided by that point in the movie. Like "Ice Station Zebra," an earlier film with a similar sensibility and execution, the journey is more interesting than the destination.

"Star Trek: Enterprise" finally picks up steam in its third season -- about equal in watchability as the original series was in its third -- but it's too little, too late. Bowing to the popularity of the "Star Wars" films and the serial format enjoyed by them and soap operas, the crew of the Enterprise faces for much of the season a heretofore unknown alien tribe known as the Xindi and their neon, blinky version of the Death Star. It's refreshing that aliens are shown in multiple races and species, instead of the standard, slightly altered caucasoids-of-the-week that permeate most American sci-fi, but there's nothing particularly illuminating about them as a race or as an enemy. Instead, the Xindi function as a TV version of the Trade Federation in the George Lucas vehicles, arguing amongst themselves even as they put into action a diabolical plan to destroy Earth. (In the fashion of recent sci-fi, the plot device for their motivation is needlessly complicated . . . yet again some contemporary "Star Trek" hokum about time travel and the need to destroy Earth before it destroys them.) Scott Bakula comes awfully close at times to being a living, breathing person, and the romantic subplot between the delectable Jolene Blalock (T'Pol) and the likable Connor Trinneer (Tucker) meanders between being engaging and being junior high kissy-face and note-passing. While none of the episodes is particularly thoughtful, the music and pacing pick up markedly, to the degree that "Star Trek: Enterprise" begins to approximate real television, even if overall it's still an expensive but smudged photocopy of the original "Star Trek."

&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; has more in common with 1968's &quot;Barbarella&quot; than the comic strip hero of the same name, but still manages to deliver many of the goods expected of campy adult fantasy. Sam Jones is a dopey version of Buster Crabbe's dashing serial hero--fittingly, an over-hormoned football star with a heart that works faster than his brain. Lovely Melody Anderson embodies Dale Arden as a spunky 1930's girl-next-door transplated into the plastic, &quot;modern&quot; 1980s, while sultry Ornella Muti, as Princess Aura, is every adolescent boy's imagining of sex. International stars Topol and Max Von Sydow chew up the scenery as astrophysicist Zarkhov and evil Emperor Ming, respectively, and Peter Wyngarde and ex-James Bond Timothy Dalton do dark turns in secondary roles. The story, laced with PG-rated violence and sexual innuendo, is a tongue-in-cheek rehash of the serials, as Ming ravages Earth until our intrepid heroes rocket to his kingdom to set things straight. This time, they find worlds created with the most elaborate visual effects of the day, some convincing, many not, but all strangely beautiful. If you liked the original, you'll see that most of the swipes are gentle and that as juvenile as the script is, the movie is really aimed at grown-ups. A spirited performance by British TV veteran Brian Blessed and a thumping soundtrack by rock supergroup Queen help make this one memorable.

At times a taut and effective thriller that seems the pattern for much of Tom Clancy's books, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; has a fairly simple plot: a space capsule with top secret photographs crashes, prompting a race between the Soviets and Americans to recover it from the polar icecap. Yet, the tension is kept reasonably high, even as much of the movie is spent aboard the U.S. submarine carrying the recovery team. Rock Hudson is, well, rock solid as the submarine captain--cool, thoughtful, and easy-going, he plays well against the skulking but ironic British spy (a teriffic Patrick MacGoohan, essentially playing the same part he always does in the way only he seems able to) that may or may not be a saboteur. Viewers will recognize other familiar faces--Jim Brown and Ernest Borgnine among them--that root the film in the 60s, and the whole production--including the cinematography, special effects, and score by Maurice Jarre--are topnotch. The only real weaknesses to the film are the mystery of who is the double agent and an action ending that seems almost anticlimactic when compared to the genuine tension in the rest of the story. Still, it's a better espionage thriller than most of those found in theaters today.

The bottom line: Tony Scott is a crap director, and "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" is a reimagining of a much better film. The original, starring Walter Matthau, worked in part because he brought a sense of genuine NYC attitude to a character written partly as jokey and partly as curmudgeonly, offsetting the dapper but steely gang leader played by his co-star, Robert Shaw. The movie was also smart enough to let things develop at their own pace; after all, it was a thinking person's suspense thriller and not a knuckle-dragger's action movie. Guess where this version will end up. Scott's version stars two likable actors in Denzel Washington and John Travolta but playing parts they've played better many times before and suffering mostly because Scott can't figure out what kind of movie he wants. The ballistic camera movements that have become standard today have no geography as quick zooms to insignificant details and lots of thumping music to accompany what amounts to people just walking around give the movie a more spastic than engaging sensibility. At the same time, despite the fact that people seem to run a lot, not much happens in the first 45 minutes that matches the urgency of the editing. The plot basically remains the same, though the profanity-laced script struggles to find something relevant to say in the update: A gang of criminals, led here by Travolta, hijacks a subway car, holding hostages for ransom while a Transit Authority manager (Washington) begins to sort out the situation and save the day. But while Shaw was smart to play the gang leader as a cold, calculating man Travolta chews up scenery in a reprise of the over-the-top baddies he's specialized in since "Face Off." And Washington is not Matthau. If you've seen the original, you also know that part of what made the story work was that the players all seemed like grown-ups: put-upon, world-weary, cautious, sarcastic, thoughtful. They had three human dimensions. Here, they're badly dressed, hyperkinetic teenagers in all but their actual biological age . . . except for the requisite punk teenager and his dimwitted sexting girlfriend who will remind you why you didn't have kids if you did not. Even the presence of a flock of good character actors like John Turturro and James Gandolfini adds almost nothing except a certain regret that they weren't in something better. If you've never seen the original, and you don't get a headache from the spastic qualities, you'll probably find "The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3" passable at best . . . hardly worth the trouble of redoing what was a good movie to begin with.

Having done my best to resist the hype and controversy regarding "The Passion of the Christ," I finally had the chance to view it on DVD. It is a sturdy, beautifully-filmed version of a story that is eminently familiar to millions; the new spin here is the level of verisimilitude offered in depicting the last brutal hours leading to Christ's crucifixion. And that's where the film is both brilliant and maddening.On the one hand, if its central message is that Jesus of Nazareth--whether one believes him to have been the son of God or simply a charismatic, visionary upstart--suffered a gruesome demise on behalf of his efforts, then showing suffering is absolutely critical to creating the proper catharsis about his sacrifice. To that end, I found myself in tears several times, as well as filled with moments of joy and hope before the film ended, something that at my age doesn't happen from watching movies much anymore.On the other hand, I also wondered if everything I saw was truly necessary. Too many films today have a pornographic fixation on violence, and the slow-motion shots and efforts to simultaneously mollify and shock with visceral images often tread into fetishism. I found myself actually wondering while witnessing these moments if "Bambi" or "Old Yeller" were remade today, would we have 20-minute scenes of the demise of sympathetic characters not to illicit true emotions, but simply to appeal to some bloodthirsty part of ourselves that wants to see them. (No, for those looking for an ax to grind, I'm not comparing the life of Christ to children's movies; I'm comparing the cinematic experience of creating deeply sympathetic characters that die to the notion of just how brutal their deaths must be to make us feel something profound.)If there are obvious weaknesses to the film, they are mostly technical. Mel Gibson's direction is quite controlled and inspired, but like most contemporary filmmakers, he over-relies on the closeup, giving the film, as a friend later suggested, a claustrophobic feel. John Debney's soundtrack is moving, even if some elements remind me of James Horner's "Glory" soundtrack. Most of the cast is good, if thug-like or wan, and Jim Caveziel's Jesus, like Willem DaFoe's in "The Last Temptation of Christ," is sympathetic but lacks the full virtue, kindness and profundity I associate with Christ. In a word, he's just too ordinary (even if he's made up to look a little more like a product of the Middle East rather than Western Europe).Lastly, I've never understood how anyone can profess to love Jesus but still somehow have animus toward Jews--it just boggles the mind. I don't believe "The Passion of the Christ" reinforces negative stereotypes, though there clearly are villains and tormentors represented here, and I'm sure some people will read into the characterizations what they will. I found things pretty even-handed, with both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters of the faiths and ethnicities that share the spotlight in this film.

Raquel Welch is a stunningly attractive woman, a genuine and deserved sex symbol that long before the so-called supermodels lumbered onto the scene gave men yet another reason to drop to their knees and be thankful. That's about the best thing I can say about anything related to "Fathom." Oh, I suppose the locations are picturesque, too, and Clive Revill turns in yet another fun, colorful supporting performance. Less a genuine spy spoof and more a cheeky travelogue with some warmed-over espionage shenanigans, "Fathom" doesn't really try very hard to do anything but show Welch in all of her mostly underdressed glory. I admit that that is a strong draw but still not really enough to keep a viewer's complete attention and like Halle Berry or Denise Richards, she'd probably do better if most of the time she said less onscreen. Believe it or not, the thin story comes from a novel and was adapted by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., a screenwriter known for both genuine thrillers ("The Parallax View"; "Three Days of the Condor") and camp ("Batman"; "Flash Gordon"), as well as the uneven "Thunderball" remake, "Never Say Never Again." "Fathom" falls mostly into the camp camp, meaning that we're supposed to chuckle knowingly at the thought of a skydiving dental assistant being recruited to be an international spy by character actor Ronald Fraser (who looks disturbingly like a grown-up version of "Stewie" from "Family Guy.") Never-quite-a-leading-man Tony Franciosa tries valiantly to inject some cool into the film and Tom Adams, who starred in his own, hard-to-find "Charles Vine" spy spoofs, is a stoic antagonist. While "Fathom" probably isn't worth an hour and a half of your time, Welch does look dazzling most of the time, and the photography is quite pretty. These qualities might be enough for some viewers.

Less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor, "In Like Flint" still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films. The indomitable Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says, "An actor as president?"). That is, until a renegade ZOWIE general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of power. The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a Russian ballerina. "In Like Flint" feels more grown up than the previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody. Notions like the Red Scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the bouncing sing-a-long ball. Only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment, as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort: a no-frills DVD.

As breezy and formless as a good vacation or a life of shameless self-indulgence, "Modesty Blaise" is likely to drive anyone expecting a standard Hollywood plot nuts. In a way, that's what makes it most appealing. With director Joseph Losey's eclectic mix of old-fashioned studio and handheld verite styles, set to a swinging 60s Eurotrash soundtrack, there's enough happening in each scene to dazzle the senses--if not the brain--provided you see the letterboxed version, of course. Sultry Monica Vitti is Modesty Blaise, an international thief recruited by the British government to interfere with a diamond payoff involving an old arch-enemy (Dirk Bogarde), presumed dead all these years. Along for the ride is the often-creepy Terrance Stamp, cast here perfectly as a Cockney ally handy with a knife. There's not much in "Modesty Blaise" that makes sense conventionally, but viewing it as something of a time capsule--not for its camp or art direction, but for the many crisply photographed scenes of locations like London and Amsterdam-makes for a fascinating experience. And though much is made of Vitti's heavily accented command of English, listening to her is a more pleasant experience than to so many other actors challenged by speaking the language, such as Sylvester Stallone, Rosie Perez, Arnold Swarzenegger, Anna Nicole Smith, or Snoop Dog. You might even notice scenes that may have inspired similar ones in "Arabesque," "Casino Royale" and the "Charlie's Angels" redux. Like the much overhyped "Barbarella" a few years later, "Modesty Blaise" is a product of its time, no "Blow Up" but a curiosity to be experienced.

"State and Main" is a throwback to the often gentle but hilarious satires of the 50s and 60s--you know the ones where the bucolic splendor of small-town America is thrust into chaos by the arrival of out-of-towners. Like "The Music Man" and "The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming!", David Mamet's sendup is witty and affecting, though many of his famous four-letter-word sensibilities still pepper the mix. The terrific ensemble cast includes Alec Baldwin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rebecca Pidgeon, William H. Macy, and Sarah Jessica Parker, and the story revolves around a frenetic movie crew struggling to turn a dramatic disaster into a box-office winner. Along the way, they brave graft from the locals, the Machiavellian efforts of a producer, and the peccadilloes of a star that deserves to be locked up. Despite some raunch and cynicism, Mamet somehow manages to splash a sweet gloss on it all, particularly with a refreshingly watchable romance between Hoffman and Pidgeon. Look for some great sight gags, too, and, of course, Mamet's penchant for rip-snortin' dialogue. About the only complaint I have is that Ricky Jay didn't have more to do.

Though the George Pal version of "The Time Machine" is still the better interpretation of Wells' novel, this special-effects-heavy update merits a view for its sheer determination to be fun. Guy Pearce takes over the reins from Rod Taylor, and like his predecessor, maintains a stalwart sense of decency as a Victorian inventor out of time. The twist here is that the time traveler seeks not the utopian future presumed in the novel--and therefore unfortunately avoids many of the philosophical discussions about the nature of humankind in the former film--but to overturn a personal tragedy. The result is a Saturday-matinee-style adventure that is both colorful and high-spirited, to the degree that much of the cynicism of Wells' original concept goes unnoticed. (Many viewers will probably overlook the irony that it is the "civilized" time traveler who introduces genocide to the post-apocalyptic future). Add some truly beautiful Eloi, a brief but effective performance by Jeremy Irons, and a lush score (despite sounding a bit too much like Jerry Goldsmith's from "The Edge"), and the combination is calculated to satisfy. Watch it with the family.

In the "Flint" films, the late James Coburn does a fine turn as a superspy so outrageous he makes the James Bond series look like Masterpiece Theater. And while "Our Man Flint" and its sequel, "In Like Flint," were meant to spoof the Bond films, they actually did a fine job of predicting where the Bond series would venture with Roger Moore as 007. Both films offer grand entertainment, even if they are breezier than most Bonds but never as stylish or intense, and Coburn, a far better and smarter actor than most people give him credit for, actually makes you believe that Derek Flint is real. Here, he's recruited by an old foil (Lee J. Cobb, in a terrific put-upon performance) who now heads ZOWIE, a spy organization that's one part FBI and one part CONTROL, of "Get Smart" fame. Flint quickly discovers that recent changes in weather patterns are the result of misguided scientists out to change the world for the better, or so they think. Even though some of the model work is inconsistent--watch how many times a submarine morphs into different types--the special effects are colorful and fit the film's pop art feel, the cast of beauties that includes Gina Golan is quite pleasant to watch, and Flint's simple theme by Jerry Goldsmith suits him to a T. But the best thing about "Our Man Flint" is the humor; long before the "Austin Powers" movies, "Our Man Flint" took time to poke fun at its own genre. You'll see a remarkably Sean-Connery-esque "Triple-Oh-Eight," a comical comparison between the villainous "Galaxy" and Bond's Spectre, and a cigarette lighter meant to put 007's attache case in "From Russia to Love" to shame. In fact, it's hard to figure out how "Our Man Flint" wasn't sued for copyright infringement, parody or not. Watch out, too, for an "Anti-American Eagle" and "Hans Gruber," the name later used by the villain in "Die Hard." Now, if only there were more extras on the DVD . . .

Ever more interested in visual stylizations than story or pacing, Tim Burton is in good form for the first half of "Sleepy Hollow," which "borrows" liberally from the Hammer films that starred more than a few actors in this cast. Here, talented Johnny Depp brings to life a different Ichabod Crane than the schoolteacher imagined by Washington Irving -- more Poe's Dupin, he is an anachronistic detective seeking scientific plausibility in his investigation of gruesome murders. That "Sleepy Hollow" manages to evoke memories of Saturday afternoon monster thrillers is its biggest strength; rapid descent into talky romantic pablum and hocus pocus is its undoing, as the sparks between Depp and the dour but childlike Christina Ricci misfire, and the denouement is surprisingly tensionless. Students of literature will find little of the short story upon which the film is loosely based except character names, but fans of everything from "The Brides of Dracula" to the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes thrillers will get visual treats. The climax in a windmill -- despite the tiresome need for rather illogical pyrotechnics -- is right out of a horror movie (and, perhaps, Hitchcock's "Foreign Correspondent.") Though the bloodletting is rather, well, bloodless, the violence in the film is amped up enough psychologically to make the film non-kid friendly, and Burton can't resist his predictable need to shock by turning, in this case, a rather pleasant bedtime moment into a family's massacre. It's really worth about three and a half stars, but with Amazon's system, I'll round up to four because of the appearances of so many great character actors -- look for them yourself.

Though suffering from the same weak-villain malaise as most modern Bond films, "Tomorrow Never Dies" nonetheless scores big in the action and style departments, making it the best of the Brosnan Bonds. The latest 007 is in top form here, playing a contemporary Bond with the correct mixture of threat and thought, even if Brosnan is still no Sean Connery. This time, Bond squares off against a William-Randolf-Hearst-esque villain bent on increasing the circulation of his tabloid newpaper, "Tomorrow," by starting World War III. Bond is assisted by the most exciting Bond girl of recent years--no, not the bubble-headed Teri Hatcher, but the beautiful and capable Michelle Yeoh as a Chinese agent who is every bit as smooth as her British counterpart. Why on earth she hasn't been in another Bond film or her own based on the character is beyond me, as she puts to shame any other female action hero of late, whether that be "The Matrix's" Carrie-Anne Moss or "Die Another Day's" Halle Berry. With a terrific teaser sequence, excellent score by David Arnold (who manages to evoke John Barry without simply imitating him), stylish look and production values, and fast-paced, if relatively thin, storyline, "Tomorrow Never Dies" suffers only from relatively minor problems, such as Jonathan Pryce's ho-hum villain, who is more a spoiled child than an egomaniacal genius, and some secondary characters--such as the campy "Dr. Kaufman" and anarchist Gupta, played by poor, wasted Ricky Jay--that fall flat. Kudos to Director Roger Spottiswoode for putting excitement back into the Bond series.

The problem with "Goldeneye" isn't so much that it's a weak film--though it isn't all that strong, either--it's that after waiting six years for the next installment in the Bond series, it's rather uneven and unremarkable. With a plot centered around the comic book and Friday night TV cliche of your old friend being your new enemy, this first Brosnan outing feels more like a slightly-better-produced cable production in both story and execution than a lavish Bond. Like the razor-sharp Timothy Dalton's final Bond adventure, this film's story tries to be a bit edgier than those of the Moore era, but unlike Dalton, Brosnan seems to struggle to find what Bond he wants to play--quietly determined, spiritedly cocky, or wryly humorous. (It doesn't help that he essentially makes his first appearance dangling upside down in a lavatory with a seated Russian soldier--we've certainly travelled a bizarre road since Connery was introduced at the gambling table.) With his longish hair, wiry frame, and ordinary clothes, he also seems out of his league as 007--more like Remington Steele on a budget and with a hangover--though he is quite excellent in some scenes, including his bathhouse confrontation with Xenia Onatopp (the statuesque but rather dead looking Famke Jannsen). On the plus side are the beautiful and charming Izabella Scorupco as a double-cross survivor, Sean Bean as the duplicitous 006, a fun tank chase (though a bit too campy, considering the tone of the rest of the film), the return of the DB5, and Tina Turner's title song. On the negative are some truly awful special effects (Bond's ridiculous bluescreen glide to catch a falling airplane), Eric Serra's "banging random notes on a keyboard" instrumental score, an "M" who can't decide if she's made of bricks or straw, a Moneypenny who's suddenly become a petulant spokesperson for NOW, a completely irritating nerd in the form of Alan Cumming, and an overall production that just feels "lite," despite the story going on about 15 minutes too long. The result is a film that claims to be a James Bond adventure, but doesn't quite look or act like it.

The best movie monsters have always been ones that are the most human, and Brian DePalma's powerful adaptation of Stephen King's bestseller &quot;Carrie&quot; features some of the most vile to ever fill the screen. Selfish, sadistic, arrogant, violent, and senseless, the teenagers that torment Carrie White (an outstanding Sissy Spacek) deserve their punishment--and more--and DePalma milks every drop of sympathy for Carrie and animosity for them possible. Unlike so many DePalma films (&quot;The Untouchables&quot; being a notable exception), &quot;Carrie&quot; builds to its climax with a natural sense of inevitability, making the tragedy that ensues all the more devastating. By now, the plot is well known; a misfit with budding telekinetic powers struggles with puberty, a cruel religious zealot of a mother (Piper Laurie), and a high school populated by representatives of everything that is despicable about humanity (or European-American culture, as none of the major players is an ethnic minority and the social commentary is rather obvious). When the full extent of her powers are realized, Carrie cleans house, sparing neither the guilty nor the innocent. (Even a well-meaning teacher ignorant of Carrie's true powers is not spared.) DePalma gives the film a dreamy sensibility, and now that the music and fashion have returned somewhat, &quot;Carrie&quot; does not seem as dated as it was even a few years ago. Special mention goes to John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles for being so effectively rotten (their glee when slaughtering a pig is especially creepy); their villainy is far more chilling than the paint-by-numbers variety that most actors portray. And what of Carrie, herself? The film correctly leaves that up to us to decide.

Having Attention Deficit Disorder may not be required when watching "Requiem for a Dream," but it probably helps. If being bombarded with many of the same images throughout the film isn't enough to make you feel this way, then the onslaught of style over substance--sped up action, rotating cameras, fisheye lenses, split screen effects--that stands in for a compelling plot will. Based on the 1970s novel of the same title, "Requiem for a Dream" chronicles the predictable downward spiral of several characters whose otherwise empty lives revolve around drugs of one kind or another. The most interesting of them is a diet-obsessed TV junkie (Ellen Burstyn, who rather disturbingly resembles "Three's Company"'s Mrs. Roper here)--we see her devolve into a hideous sketch of her former self with the help of physician-endorsed speed. By comparison, the troubles of blank-faced co-stars Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans seem trivial and almost a distraction. I'm probably just too old to be moved by it all; overwrought sequences of people lazing about, freaking out while searching for their next fix, or turning to one form of human degradation or another in desperation just seem cliched and emotionally sterile, perhaps because I still remember "Gridlock'd," "Trainspotting," "Naked Lunch" and "Drugstore Cowboy." Nonetheless, I'm guessing younger people will be pretty impressed, and to be fair, the acting and technical tricks occasionally almost make up for the low budget and paper-thin story. The soundtrack by Kronos Quartet is also sufficiently hip and brooding to match the mood of the film, but mute the sound during any of the repetitive "getting high" or "tripping bad" scenes and see if it still seems like something meaningful is going on. While I saw the unedited version, I'm stumped as to what was deemed the equivalent of "NC-17" material, as there's nothing here I haven't seen on HBO--ratings nowadays really do seem rather arbitrary.

Lightweight storywise--but no more so than a modern James Bond movie--"Shaft" is nonetheless stylish and entertaining, even with some scenes of terrible violence. Samuel L. Jackson makes a worthy successor to the family legacy of being supercool, playing the same sort of urban 007 Richard Roundtree brought to life in the Shaft films of the 1970s. This time, the nephew of the original clashes with a brutal racist and a showoff drug kingpin who have joined forces to stalk the only witness to a savage murder. Director John Singleton keeps the energy constant, helped in part by Isaac Hayes' terrific theme and David Arnold's incidental music, though the occasional quick zoom gets annoying after a while. Taken as entertainment with a little social commentary, "Shaft" offers little to dislike, except, perhaps, the brief appearance by Roundtree, who also seems more mellow and unhip this time around.

There's not much to add that hasn't been said before about &quot;Casino Royale&quot; except that it's ironic that a studio rival to that which produced most of the other Bonds was able to secure the rights to what is arguably the hardest hitting Bond book--and turn it into a mostly unfunny comedy. David Niven, once a contender for the more serious films, plays Sir James Bond, a stuttering hedonist who's only a shorthand version of his public persona. Lured back to Her Majesty's Secret Service by &quot;M&quot; (played with a twinkle by John Huston, who also directs at least part of the film), he recruits a shy cardsharp (Peter Sellers in one of his few subdued roles) to impersonate Bond and dethrone the embezzling Russian agent LeChiffre (Orson Welles, who would have done fine in a straight version of the book). The cast, which includes sexy Bond veteran Ursula Andress and a pre-arthouse Woody Allen, is great, as are the visuals, but the choppy editing and schizophrenic story will make your head hurt, as might Herb Alpert's elevator-friendly score. In the end, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; works best as a glimpse into the campy side of 1960s pop culture and reminds Bond fans that a more faithful version of Ian Fleming's terrific book is long overdue.

With people obsessing about Viet Nam and Watergate in 1974, it's a wonder a movie as optimistic as The Island at the Top of the World was even produced. Leave it to Disney. Stubbornly old-fashioned--and therefore family friendly--it follows a group of adventurers who stumble upon a lost Viking society in Antarctica. The mostly European cast--save for a flat but still likeable David Hartman and woefully underused character actor Mako--gives it a jauntily Victorian feel that seems almost innocent today (though grad students will zero in on the post-colonial subtext). While older kids are probably too cynical to enjoy the movie (Gasp! It has a happy ending and positive message), younger kids will probably like the art direction and special effects, crude by today's standards but quite possibly the inspiration for such films as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Even hard-hearted Gen-Xers might get a little nostalgic over this one.

Less about war and more about duty, friendship, and hard work, Otto Preminger's &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; rises above its sometimes soap-operatic script, offering fine entertainment. Wayne, Douglas, and Meredith are utterly believable as a trio of go-getters fighting the Japanese Navy, not to mention the reptilian glad-handers of their own. Though the sparkless romantic subplot involving wooden Tom Tryon and Paula Prentiss drags, Preminger keeps the battle scenes--both in front of and behind enemy lines--taut and meaningful. Wayne inspires as the take-charge Rock Torry, a sailor's sailor who has an almost innocently sweet love affair with earthy Patricia Neal, but it's Douglas, as his tortured best friend, that gives the movie its emotional punch. Not as weepy as &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; nor as haunting as &quot;The Thin Red Line,&quot; &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; nonetheless reminds viewers that great accomplishments often come at great cost. Watch and see how much it seems to have inspired later efforts, particularly the mini-series &quot;The Winds of War.&quot; The film also features a poignant score by Jerry Goldsmith.

In yet another late-20th-century examination of the paradox of WASP families failing to work properly yet somehow nonetheless proliferating, "Heavenly Creatures" introduces a by-now familiar set of dysfunctional, selfish characters careening toward disaster. Here, Kate Winslett and Melanie Lynskey are the creatures in question, two odd, angst-ridden teenagers in 1950s New Zealand whose mutual affection and creepy fantasy lives lead to murder. The film gives a fair share of the culpability to the parents, though in the true spirit of class warfare, the uppercrust family-which includes a stodgy university cuckold and his hedonistic wife, a marriage counselor whose therapy technique includes bedding her charges-escapes with the least harm, even if it deserves the greatest amount of blame. It is the "poor," dark-haired girl, with all that bad blue-collar blood, that instigates the ultimate crime, her mother, perhaps the only truly sympathetic character, the one who pays the ultimate price. Director Peter Jackson weaves Terry Gilliam-esque fantasy sequences with even stranger real events, the results being an unsettlingly colorful film whose low-budget and sparse production seem to enhance rather than detract from the all-too-true story. Still the film's sequences often walk, sometimes trip over a fine line between camp and drama, with Winslett in particular delivering performances that are so affected they frequently grate on the nerves. The film works best when it shows the breeziness of young girls and the happiness the leads find in each other's company and arms; it's worst when it tries to generate any real sympathy for them. Ultimately, their crime is senseless and misdirected, and one is left at the end with a feeling that we've been bamboozled into caring about them in the first place.

If you were around in the 1970s, you remember more than just the bad fashions and the disco music. You also remember that American men - a lot of American men - still held on to the last vestiges of what it meant to be traditionally masculine. That is to say you acted like a swaggering, boorish ass with more muscles than brains. Of course, this persona might be tempered, ironically, with long, feminized hair, special attention to how your butt looked in jeans, and an addiction to drugs and alcohol. Such were the times. If you were a boy during this time, and you were lucky enough to have a father who acted like a man rather than an overgrown child, you observed the phenomenon with a mixture of pity and apprehension. If not, you turned out a lot like the guys in "North Dallas Forty." They're not bad guys, at least not in the sense of digging up corpses or something, but they demonstrate the flaws of an extended adolescence built on a foundation of intimidating people one way or the other with testosterone. Nick Nolte, never more born to play a role, is one of these guys, sort of, a thinking-man's football player discovering that despite his best efforts he is getting old. And age just isn't agreeing with him. His body is addled with aches and pains; his mind is clouded with narcotics so that if anything in his frat-boy-envious world ever made sense, it no longer does to him anymore. Even sex brings more pain than pleasure. His struggle is not particularly original. He is the lion long in the tooth, surrounded by other lions that haven't figured it out yet, if they ever will. Certainly, the superior "The Longest Yard" covered similar ground but more effectively because it gave the players a cause to play the game. In "North Dallas Forty," playing the game is the cause. Yet this story makes sense in a time of casual sex, drugs, and rock and roll and in a country where professional athletes are treated like they're gods. There is something psychotically desperate in their flight from anything resembling civilization, from the parties where Playboy playmates are dragged off to be violated, often with grinning protests, to the bone-crushing efforts on the playing field in pointless competition. By the mid-80s and early 90s, these guys had turned into steroid-juicing Schwarzenegger types, their hair trimmed neatly and their muscles oiled to homoerotic perfection (shhh, don't tell them), but here they are still rough around the edges, flawed like real people are. "North Dallas Forty" succeeds in exactly what it wants to be - an indictment of the very image of man that it glorifies, but in this it is never satirical enough to be biting and never insightful enough to be dramatic. It is fun though, the way watching a guy get hit in the crotch on "America's Funniest Home Videos" is fun. Look for Mac Davis as a good old boy looking out for his friends' best interests so long as they approximate his own, but watch out for Dayle Haddon, who would be a deck chair if she were any more wooden. G.D. Spradlin plays a prick as only he can. Ted Kotcheff, never an imaginative director, gives a sallow realism in his straightforward approach, one of the highlights of a film that is at times a Mad Magazine version of professional sports. The best scene in the film occurs in the locker room as the players nervously await the upcoming game. You can almost smell the desperation and Ben Gay, and the bit where the minister blesses the whole event is a hoot. And now that 80s are back fashion wise, we might even see this neanderthal return to celebrated glory.

With the success of "Harry Potter" and "The Lord of the Rings," it was inevitable that another British fantasy classic would be shipped into theaters to ride the latest wave of interest in Anglo entertainment (or, perhaps, the latest invasion of Anglo entertainment, as the English seem to have a stranglehold on entertainment imported to the U.S.) And like these other films, "The Chronicles of Narnia" scores high points in aesthetic achievement: it's a generally beautiful film to look at and listen to. Its actors are competent, if not nearly as appealing as those of, say, "Bedknobs and Broomsticks," "Dragonslayer," and other Disney fare plumbing the same basic material. Where it suffers is in its uneven storyline, from characters that are sometimes annoying in their inconsistency (the "smart" older sister seems pretty dumb and rather annoying all around, for instance) to a Christian allegorical framework that includes - and I'm not kidding - Santa Claus handing out deadly weapons to children. In fact, I thought it a little disturbing in these trying times of religious extremism to see a film that on one hand purports to have spiritual overtones while at the same time advancing the notion that only through all-out bloodletting can that spiritualism be preserved. (I'm not sure westerners wouldn't be decrying this idea if the religion were a different one.) In the end, though, "The Chronicles of Narnia" is good but not great entertainment. The buildup to the climactic, technically well-conceived battle scene seems to take forever to reach, as the thinness of the plot - a group of displaced British children find a passageway to a secret frozen world through the back of a wardrobe - couldn't quite hold my attention. Maybe I'm just overloaded on the Anglocentric stuff, or maybe I should read the book, as a friend tells me it's much better. I'd give it three and half stars, though with Amazon's ranking system, I'll call it even at three.

Had "Arbitrage" been made, say, a few decades ago, it might have seemed a fresh commentary on the mores of the super-rich, but as it stands, it's mostly a series of predictable cliches done better in other films ("Margin Call," for instance). That's a shame because the acting isn't bad, and the film's pace is reasonably good.Richard Gere -- who's looking more and more like Leonard Nimoy every day -- plays one of those roles he's already done many times before: charming dick. He's silver-haired but still dashing and owns an investment house, or should I say house of cards, that he's trying to sell off to the next greedy sucker before they -- or his daughter -- figure out the company is in the red for hundreds of millions of dollars. He's married to Susan Sarandon, who still has the Betty Boop eyes and hypnotic cleavage that made her famous, but he gets some on the side from Laetitia Casta, a hawkish French wannabe artist mostly interested in moving overpriced paintings and then shoving coke up her nose. The closest thing the script gets to character dimension is when she, Lifetime TV movie-style, comes to the realization that Gere will never leave his wife . . . and we come to the realization that despite all her possessive harping at him for not being in her life enough, never actually says she loves him. Then there's an icy and naive but pontificating daughter that is Gere's company's CFO, quickly uncovering the tracks her father has so carefully tried to conceal. I don't remember who she is, but you'll swear she was the same girl who played Dan Akroyd's shrewish girlfriend in "Trading Places."This is one of those movies where nobody has a moral center; it's all about self-aggrandizement, and every character is simply selfish in one way or another and in varying degrees. Wow, didn't know people could be like that. What's annoying is that the film wants us to invest more in them when it doesn't offer us anything else. They're not even conflicted, and the irony of so many people sponging off of Gere's character while also trying to run him down seems lost on the screenwriter. The closest person in the film to having any kind of redemptive conscience is Nate Parker's Jimmy Grant, the unwitting pawn in helping Gere to cover up yet another potential disaster, and it's convenient, too, that he's black! How's that for a subtle commentary on the far-reaching if dwindling racial privilege of being a WASP in the 21st Century? For added subtlety, there's an Asian butler up at all hours to wait on the family hand and foot. Again, though such inequities are still relevant today, the ideas would seem more startling in a film made years ago, and since the film has no particularly thoughtful ideas at all, seem like part of a formula envisioned in the 1970s. I was actually hoping the movie would jettison the rest of the story and just focus on Jimmy because he was the only character with anything approximating substance in the movie. But even he sells out!While "Arbitrage" does an adequate job of showing us what mercenaries human beings can be, there's nothing particularly memorable or visceral about any scene, and the movie is content to tell us what we already know. If "Margin Call" had the good sense to give some depth or at least flash to the slimy and desperate characters who inhabited its narrative, "Arbitrage" is content to settle for the Cliffs Notes version -- sorry, I guess I should say SparkNotes to keep up with the times. If you're expecting dialogue layered with insight or scenes of visual irony what you'll get instead are gems like "F--- you" and the contrasts between swanky Manhattan apartments and the institutional bowels of the Hall of Justice (and not the good kind, like on "Superfriends"). In fact, this is one of those movies where the F word is almost comically inserted into the empty dialogue to spruce it up, the worst offender being a judge who I had hopes would bring some dignity to the movie.One more word about the talent misused in this movie. Tim Roth, whose performances I always enjoy, is basically doing an edgy Columbo, and though it was nice to see Stuart Margolin in front of the cameras again, I was hoping he would be given more to do. The same goes for the gravelly-voiced Reg E. Cathey, perhaps most known for his recurring roles in "Oz" and "The Wire." Also when I explained the key conflict in the plot to my best friend, she summed the solution up perfectly in seconds: Move to Russia. Gee, too bad the filmmaker's hadn't had the same moment of clarity.

Though it's the weakest entry in the original Harry Palmer spy series, "Billion Dollar Brain" is definitely worth a look for aficionados of Len Deighton's novels and Michael Caine's performances. Down on his luck as a private eye, Palmer reluctantly takes on a mission for his old boss (all-too-brief appearances by Guy Doleman) in MI5, where he is sucked into a scheme grand enough for a Bond film. What is remarkable about "Billion Dollar Brain" is not the plot -- as muddled as any dreamed up by Deighton -- but that it is remarkably prescient. The film's muted cinematography previews what will become the norm a few years later, as by the 1970s movies lost their technicolor gloss in favor of the more dull, documentary look that this film relentlessly conveys. Moreover, it gives us a glimpse of what the computer-reliant world of today was imagined to be in 1967, from reasonably accurate mechanical phone messages to high-tech security systems employing cameras, retina scans, and voice-recognition equipment. What might have a been a campy characterization for the time -- Ed Begley's blustery, right-wing loon -- is all too terribly real in an age of wealthy demagogues who preach God in one breath and utter destruction of their enemies, real and imagined, in the other. Caine is, as always, impeccable as Palmer, the cynical, reluctant spy, though Karl Malden matches him as scheming collaborator Leo Newbegin, but the lovable Oscar Holmoka steals the show once again as the Russian, Stok, ironically Harry's only true friend in the business. Francoise Dorleac is lovely, and familiar character actors Milo Sperber and Vladek Sheybal round out a good cast. Director Ken Russell does some interesting things with the camera and even manages to infuse adult subtext into scenes that don't require it. (Consider the discovery of the body of Dr. Kaarna, for instance, killed by an amorous female assassin, and what she must have been doing to him to pull it off.) The film's score by Richard Rodney Bennet is a bit of a letdown, at times shrill, and there is an emptiness to the production that matches the coldness of the locations, but "Billion Dollar Brain" stays consistent in its aesthetics and its vision.

After years of hearing what a great film "The Notebook" is, I found myself in the inescapable position of actually having to watch it. It is sappy and predictable, the sort of chick flick period romance that with Canadian TV production values might have turned up as a Lifetime movie of the week. But director Nick Cassavetes eschews his father's quirky realist visual style for a more Robert Redford-like lyricism, creating a film that is at once both nostalgic and modern, if in an Eddie Bauer catalog sort of way. The story concerns two star-crossed lovers in the 1940s, seemingly doomed to be apart because they come from different sides of the tracks. It won't take long to figure out that the more interesting framing story -- that of an older couple in a rest home -- bears significant relationship to the youngsters, played with sometimes annoying verve by the always creepy Ryan Gosling (it's the tiny close-set eyes) and the always spunky Rachel McAdams (it's the tiny close-set teeth). James Garner gives a bravura performance as Duke, the older man, and Gena Rowlands, Cassavetes' mother, proves once again that she is an undervalued American treasure. Cliched as it is, "The Notebook" doesn't break much new ground, especially in the monocultural representation of the golden past, but it does offer enough genuinely weepy moments to guilt you into caring about what happens next. Still, with its incessant Hollywood gloss, the film feels too manipulative to pull all of the heartstrings, and casting Joan Allen as a shrill socialite determined to be the prophylactic between these crazy kids threatens it with full-blown melodrama.

With both Asian and Polish ancestry and having grown up only an hour or so away from Detroit, I found watching "Gran Torino" a surreal experience. Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence. In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack. (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Mickey Rourke in "Year of the Dragon.") Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, "Gran Torino" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones. Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves. Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians. And his family is a bunch of jerks. And he's dying, too. If it sounds like I'm being too hard on "Gran Torino," a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like "Letters from Iwo Jima." Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of "Gran Torino" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony. But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars). What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a "gotcha" you'll see coming from a mile away.Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling "Get off my lawn" is almost worth the price of admission alone. It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.

Beyond the blisteringly effective performances--the great Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, in particular, will make you cringe at the fraternity and sorority of complete non-talents that dominate Hollywood's acting pool today--&quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; benefits from what is probably the sharpest dialogue produced by an American or British film production in the last 50 years. Superficial comparisons to &quot;Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf&quot; notwithstanding, this film is at heart a domestic drama with nice bits of dark comedy, as O'Toole's King Henry takes up where he left off in &quot;Becket.&quot; Aged but still formidable, Henry squares off against his estranged wife, Eleanor (Hepburn), who matches Henry's thirst for power and sense of strategy so perfectly, their lashing out at one another is inevitable. You'll laugh and cry with them, and if you're particularly perceptive, you'll understand that in spite of the venom, there is genuine, if enraged, love between the two. Terrific performances by Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry, Timothy Dalton, and the rest of the cast make &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; a feast of drama, as does John Barry's understated score.

"Beautiful Girls" is one of those movies whose characters and stories are so familiar--just walk into any smoky bar on a Friday night and look around--that it makes you wonder why it even had to be made, well-made as it is. In a kind of Bizarro World "St. Elmo's Fire" (read: blue collar), we nonetheless have yet another group of young, white 20-somethings struggling through . . . well, they're not really struggling so much as just refusing to grow up, meaning that their problems are more issues of identical character flaws than anything else, and if you don't relate to or care about the characters--which I too frequently did not--the story falls flat. (Their bodies matured a lot faster than the rest of them--and isn't that always the predictable central conflict in these stories?) So, you'll see the standard male types--the ex-jock womanizer (Matt Dillon), the well-read sensitive guy (Timothy Hutton)--so sensitive as to be in love with a 13-year-old (a delightful Natalie Portman) whose maturity ironically is well beyond those of the adults--the cement-headed goof (Michael Rappaport), the dutiful husband, the oafish but wizened bartender, etc. The women fare slightly better, as the blonde bombshell (Uma Thurman) actually has a brain and heart, even if the cute doormat (Mina Sorvino--think Betty from "Archie") and husky hairdresser (Rosie O'Donnell--think Alice from "The Brady Bunch") could be plopped into a dozen other projects without adjustment. There are lots of things to like about this movie--the sincere, often quietly effective performances, the earthy soundtrack, the civilized grittiness of the town, Ted Demme's hands-off direction--but how many times does the same story need to be told, with many of the same cliches (There's even a fight in the alley behind the bar!)? In addition, having grown up in a blue-collar town, some details are off in the way Hollywood prefers them--yes, blue-collar folk drink but these people are raging alcholics, working class people typically have jobs, which they work very hard at, and where are all the racist and sexist jokes and hazing, even if Minnesota as depicted in the film seems completely devoid of minorities? Watch it, I guess, if your life turned out like this--or threatens to.

Taut and genuinely suspenseful, this brooding Gregory Peck western nonetheless is largely overlooked by audiences and broadcasters alike. (On a related note, please, will someone wake the people up at TCM and AMC and ask that they stop showing the same dozen movies over and over again? There are many gems like this one just waiting to be seen.) The story is a precursor to "The Terminator," as a retiring cavalry scout (Peck) unwittingly incurs the wrath of an implaccable Apache warrior after agreeing to escort to safety the white woman who escaped his clutches. What follows is a bloody, cross-country battle of wills pitting the scout's experience against the warrior's sheer determination to reclaim what he believes is his. A young Robert Forster does a fine turn as Peck's bi-racial sidekick and all-but son. Filmed in a straightforward manner and with a soundtrack that is both menacing and heroic, "The Stalking Moon" deserves a wider audience, as well as release in widescreen on DVD!

While I never quite understood the whole fascination with King Kong in the first place, I could at least see that the 1933 film had charm and, for its time, cutting-edge special effects. This big budget remake manages to simultaneously mock and pay homage to the original, which, I suppose, is no mean feat. Part of the problem involves the miscasting of Jeff Bridges as the hippie zoologist--in his younger days, he wasn't much of a presence on the screen, and here he would fade away if not for the fact that viewers can amuse themselves by comparing his look and mannerisms to those of &quot;The Dude&quot; in the underrated &quot;The Big Lebowski.&quot; The other problem is the script itself, which meanders between being &quot;adult,&quot; with its often grotesque attempts at sexuality (though it is rather nice to see the lovely Jessica Lange in various states of undress), and being pure camp. And even with Charles Grodin chewing up scenery as an oil company's Snidely Whiplash, exactly the sort of parasite everyone loved to hate during the energy crisis of the 1970s, and a production that is sufficiently big, the film never quite lives up to the original. Despite John Barry's tragic score and a climax that tries to supplant the goofiness of the rest of the story with social commentary, Kong is reduced to being a misunderstood stalker in a gorilla suit. In the end, it hardly seems worth the effort.

When given a good script, Bruce Beresford is a fine director--witness "Breaker Morant" and "Driving Miss Daisy." When saddled with a mediocre script, even one he wrote himself, his films suffer, despite their excellent cinematography and earnest acting. "Paradise Road" falls into the latter category, which is a shame because it has much going for it. Glenn Close leads a band of familiar faces, including Cate Blanchett and a strangely Dracula-like Frances McDormand, all prisoners of the Japanese on a remote island during WWII. The women face the usual hardships--loneliness, starvation, disease, torture--while spiritedly resisting the efforts of the evil Japanese to squash their resolve, which includes forming a vocal orchestra that beautifully performs some of my favorite pieces ("Bolero"; "Danny Boy"). Chances are, though, you've seen it all before in one form or another. The well-intentioned performances range from caricature (McDormand) to please-send-me-my-Oscar (Close), though we never get to the know their characters all that deeply, even with the theatrics. The Japanese characters suffer more, as they're stock types from every WWII movie you've ever seen, with a "Bridge on the River Kwai" wannabe commandant (Sab Shimono), the sympathetic, but immasculated go-between (David Chung) and the requisite sadist (Stan Egi). In fact, it's hard to watch the film without seeing echoes of "yellow horde" paranoia, as this spitfire group of white women ably thwart the best efforts of a race of villainous little men. Unlike "Shindler's List" or "Sophie's Choice," which at least tried to explore the nature of the captors, "Paradise Road" is content that they are simply villains or, at best, misled, missing golden opportunities to take the plot to higher levels. Despite some moving scenes--a camp concert and the gruesome death of a sympathetic secondary character among them--the film falls short of its potential dramatically, true story or not.

The ever-cocky, sometimes-impressive Wesley Snipes--who probably will be best remembered for snatching second-rate shoot-em-up scripts from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger--this time tackles something that relies less on guns and knives (though, alas, there is a knifepoint mugging scene). Too bad he picked a script that meanders between "9 1/2 Weeks" and any evening soap, never getting much deeper than an episode of "Red Shoe Diaries." Snipes is the typical Hollywood everyman--young, buff, wealthy, professional and with a picture-perfect family, right down to a boy, a girl, and a dog. He has the ubiquitous dream job, advertising bigshot (where, of course, he never does any real work), and tons of free time to devote to, among other things, an affair with emotionally-fragile--get this--rocket scientist Nastassja Kinski, who specializes in roles requiring a smoldering "European" look and little or no clothing. Thrown into the fray is a dying friend, played by the overrated but bafflingly lucky Robert Downey, Jr., and a princess of a wife, played by "ER"'s resident whiner, Ming-Na. The story? Well, there isn't much of one. Trapped temporarily in New York City, Snipes has a brief affair with Kinski, then returns to LA supposedly haunted by what happened. Stuff--some of it played with a somber tone that is supposed to pass for drama--happens in creaky episodic form, with Snipes' narration trying to bridge the wide gaps in time and plot, and the movie concludes with an ending that is at least as fantastic as anything in Snipes' action pictures. Director Figgis also seems almost grimly determined to avoid acknowledging the interracial dynamics of the relationships; as someone who is bi-racial, I have mixed feelings. For instance, I want to applaud its rather matter-of-fact sensibility that an African-American man can be with any woman he wants--but at the same time, I'm left deploring the old stereotype the film supports--that an African-American man can be with any woman he wants. I guess we've come a long way from Sidney Poitier stirring things up at dinner but not too far from Superfly rolling up in a flashy car. At least the movie looks good, though at times everyone's ages show a bit.

There's little doubt that the first season of "Star Trek" is the best of the original series--and arguably the best of any "Star Trek" incarnation. William Shatner is in fine form; long before his performances gravitated toward self-caricature, they were controlled, powerful, and effective, and he imbues James T. Kirk with exactly the right combination of youth and worldliness to make him believable. Leonard Nimoy gives Spock enough ragged edges in the first season to make the character seem both alien and at war with himself over his human and Vulcan(ian) halves, the perfect counterpart to DeForest Kelley's wonderfully irascible Dr. McCoy. The excellent cast of supporting players was often joined by terrific character actors, too numerous to mention here. But what makes the first season so special is the winning combination of a low-key, atmospheric narrative style and topnotch sci-fi premises, many offered by the better writers of the day. While the series would become more cartoonish as it wore on, the first season remains relatively pure--humor is used to break dramatic tension rather than at the expense of characters, genuine suspense threads many of the episodes, and the audience's senses are dazzled by the efforts of directors, cinematographers, conductors, costume designers, and special effects wizards. In other words, the show remained evocative of the "Golden Age" of television. The DVD collection includes all of the earliest episodes--minus the original pilot that was not televised during the show's initial run--but lacks many extras. Still, the opportunity to own "Star Trek" at this price makes this set alone worth the purchase.

There's something comically--and, perhaps, miserably--self-important about "Bully," starting with its proposition that although kids die every day in the inner city and in poor rural areas, it's when such deaths occur in the affluent white suburbs that we're supposed to take notice. Maybe the term I'm looking for isn't "self-important" but "self-indulgent," as there's no doubt that "Bully" is that, too. But separating what is intentional and ironic in this approach versus what is simply nacissistic and exploitative is difficult. I guess that leaves the miscreants themselves the intended audience--if so, is the film supposed to indulge their narcissism? With his semi-documentary approach, Clark stops short of giving the story any kind of moral perspective, which only adds to the sense that the audience is supposed to be titillated rather than enriched by "Bully." In the end, I was neither.

Though it suffers from the on-the-cheap film style of the 1970s -- bland lighting and too many cheesy zooms instead of dollies, for instance -- "The Spikes Gang" plays like a good novel, a drama about growing up and disillusionment rather than a standard rip-snortin' western. Richard Fleischer, son of animator Max Fleischer and director of one of my favorite childhood films, "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," paints an unsentimental portrait of the old west, even if it retains some of the imagery we've come to expect.Sturdy Lee Marvin is in fine form here, playing Harry Spikes, the sort of gentleman bandit that children (and even some foolish adults) want to believe is the reality rather than the fiction. Despite his geniality, he is a realist -- direct, logical, unflinching, and in his own way, honest. When three boys (Ron Howard, Gary Grimes, and Charles Martin Smith) fall under his influence, it spells the beginning of the end of their innocence. "The Spikes Gang" is the kind of story that rarely gets told anymore, actually showing the consequences of violence, selfishness, and poor choices. It offers a greater range of emotions than most films do today -- at times, the boys really are on the grand adventure they think they are on -- but it always comes back to harsh center. In some ways, it's a revisionist western, but "The Spikes Gang" really has more in common with the sentiments of Mark Twain, who blamed romantic writers like Walter Scott for filling the heads of boys with foolishness about the glory of war.In many ways, the film also serves as a critique of mainstream American culture. It's easy to forget that the Bible-quoting father, for instance, rules his family with a belt and an iron fist, teaching them that love is always accompanied by violence, and that all of the male role models in this film are brutal while all of the women are either untrustworthy or self-absorbed. The only place where peace even seems possible is in Mexico.Brief scenes with Arthur Hunnicutt and Noah Beery, Jr., highlight this film. Though Fred Karlin's music is at times intrusive, the emotions of the story generally run true. Unlike with most contemporary films, where the feelings are gone a few minutes after you leave the theater, this one may stay with you a long time, especially after you experience the ending, as consistent with the film as it must be.

Not having read Michael Crichton's book of the same name, I don't have the burden of comparing the novel to the film. However, I can say that &quot;Congo&quot; is no more dumb in plot or simple in characterization than that other Crichton adaptation, &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; Essentially a &quot;B&quot; movie with an overblown budget, &quot;Congo&quot; rehashes the first half of &quot;King Kong,&quot; only this time instead of a giant ape, there's a bunch of smaller--yet deadlier--apes guarding a lost city of gold. Primatologist Dylan Walsh heads an expedition into the Congo to return his prodigy, a talking ape named Amy, to her home; along for the ride are the veddy British Ernie Hudson as a mysterious but friendly arms merchant, the characteristically slimy Tim Curry as a Romanian con artist; and the icy Laura Linney as a skulking CIA operative, who's really there to find what happened to an earlier expedition that disappeared. Director Frank Marshall keeps things breezy, and the movie feels like Spielberg &quot;lighter,&quot; with lots of imitative camerawork and focus on the &quot;gee whiz&quot; of it all but with less attention given to making the characters more than stock. Anyone expecting a hard sci-fi film will be sorely disappointed, but those of us looking for a few hours of Saturday matinee escapism--uncluttered by the pretentious darkness of so many films of the 1990s--may be pleasantly surprised. High points include a nice score by Jerry Goldsmith, decent special effects, and some genuine moments of warmth and humor; low points include Linney's painfully flat acting, a visually impressive but narratively ho-hum climax, and a few scenes of unnecessary violence that keep it from being kid-friendly.

While the basic look of Simon Wincer's version of "The Phantom" is right, the film suffers from a sense of "liteness" that retards it from finding its legs as a swashbuckling adventure. The often-creepy Billy Zane turns in a decent "aw shucks" performance as The Phantom, the latest successor to a long line of superheroes who've donned a purple costume and black mask to serve justice. In this version, he's up against-predictably-a megalomaniacal millionaire (Treat Wiliams) who is bent on acquiring three skulls that will give him supernatural powers. Williams provides some laughs with his perennially excited villainy-he's like an evil, hyperactive six-year-old on metamphetamines-and the luscious Catherine Zeta-Jones does her turn as the dark-haired spideress that keeps butting heads with The Phantom's girl (a plucky if pouty Kristy Swanson). The story is Indiana Jones meets Batman, right down to caves, jungles, hidden fortresses, and pirates, with a little Jules Verne thrown in for spice (there's a cool mini-submarine that just screams "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"). But even with the addition of the delightfully craggy Patrick McGoohan as an earlier Phantom, the films seems to lag, in part because it seems so derivative. And though it's set in the 1930s and imitates serials of the era, its playing to ugly stereotypes gets tiresome-the blonde being the "good girl" and the brunette the "bad girl," the Yellow Horde seeking to enslave the world, Italians as mobsters willing to double-cross their own brothers, etc. Sure, there are lots of Americans who actually believe such hoo-ha, but that doesn't make it worth putting in a film that seems aimed at impressionable kids.

Though director Stuart Baird helped mangle the "Star Trek" franchise with the last "Next Generation" movie outting, his "Executive Decision" deserves a look by fans of the action genre. Kurt Russell plays a Jack Ryan-like intelligence operative swept into a covert assault on a hijacked airliner. Along for the ride are a crack team of commandos, played by such familiar faces as B.D. Wong, John Leguizamo, and Joe Morton, that tries to defuse a nerve gas bomb and rescue a plethora of hostages, including Halle Berry as a sympathetic flight attendant. Despite its similarities to "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" (and, eerily, some of the 9/11 goings-on), "Executive Decision" manages to establish itself as a unique effort through a combination of humanized characters and a plot that keeps ratcheting up the stakes. The movie is even gutsy enough to kill off Steven Seagal's character, who gets a nice John Wayne moment that is more salutory than most of his onscreen efforts. Fans of the "Poirot" mysteries may be surprised to see David Suchet as the villain here, but he deserves special note for taking a one-dimensional figure and giving him both menace and intelligence. Jerry Goldsmith provides a strong score, and though some airplane model work, especially at the end, is rather obvious, the film's production overall is suitably believable.

Walter Matthau's hangdog looks are like the cherry atop the sundae in Ronald Neame's acerbic -- and often genuinely funny -- satire of post-Watergate spy shenanigans and general bureaucracy, "Hopscotch." His Miles Kendig looks like a long stretch of bad road, a world-traveled but not weary agent who understands that the game of espionage is exactly that, a game, even if his superior (played here as a bloated, self-important right-winger by Ned Beatty) think it's more about crushing your opponent than misguiding him or her to your advantage. When he's threatened with a desk job for making the right choice in the field, Kendig takes a vacation with an old flame, the intellectual's sexpot, Glenda Jackson, only to be inspired to write his memoirs, a definite no-no in his profession. What ensues provides comic relief that is also at once entirely believable. There are lots of great character actors in this movie, from Sam Waterston to Herbert Lom to Severn Darden, the last of which will evoke memories of an even better satire, "The President's Analyst." Neame's direction is straightforward, choosing to let the story find its legs wistfully, like the gentle "classical" compositions that are the film's soundtrack. "Hopscotch" is neither a seat-of-the-pants thriller nor a side-splitting comedy, but as with so many projects of the decade that immediately preceded it, a very adult film with just enough fantasy to leave you stirred without being too shaken. It's a fine wine that just gets better with age.

Though no worse on several levels than the original, much-overrated "Psycho," Gus Van Sant's remake offers little that is new. Thuggish Vince Vaughn takes up the reins as Norman Bates--he's about as interesting to watch as the stuffed birds in the motel office--and pixie Anne Heche--who is more talented than most people give her credit for--gets to be his first on-screen victim. The comparisons to Alfred Hitchcock's "masterpiece" are not only obvious but required, as Van Sant, a bit too lovingly, literally re-creates nearly every scene, and Danny Elfman's score raids Bernard Herrmann's. Despite all the technical attention, though, there's something desperately missing from this version . . . perhaps the casual, plasticky times in which we live in seem rather "hollow" compared to the "grown up" 1960s in which the original was set, making the style of this film more campy than creepy. In an age when sex and violence are common commodities, even the subtext of the infamous shower scene probably gets lost among viewers used to seeing a 14-year-old's conception of such things. By the time blank-slate Jullianne Moore arrives, much of the momentum from comparing this version to the first is gone, making the rest of the film an exercise rather than entertainment.

The first half of "Die Another Day" is relatively innovative and hard-hitting for a modern Bond film; the second half devolves into the standard shiny set piece, with videogame-style car chases and explosions. In short, even if James Bond in general is a European male's mid-life crisis fantasy, this film was made mostly for kids. Pierce Brosnan returns, of course, as 007, still missing that spark that made Sean Connery's Bond a man's man, confident without being arrogant, cool without being cold. He's joined by Halle Berry, whose aptly-named Jinx will either get your motor running or annoy the daylights out of you. (Note to directors: You might keep her dialogue to a minimum and not show her running.) This time, Bond is fighting the North Koreans--even if some of the names sound Chinese, kinda like naming a German "McMullen" or an Englishman "Schmidt"--who've developed a superlaser that can . . . well, does it really matter anymore? The point is, the Asian baddies (including a charismatic Rick Yune) threaten the West and even get to torture Bond in a montage of opening credit scenes set to Madonna's listless techno music. Director Lee Tamahori keeps things big and expensive, but not much in the script explores anything with depth or interest, leaving the cool toys--like a beautiful and well-equipped Aston Martin Vanquish--and stunt sequences yet again more interesting attractions than either the characters or the story. If you're looking for a Bond who does more than go through the motions and fire off predictable one-liners while helping with various product placements, check out the older films. On the other hand, if you don't mind a paper-thin story or lack of any real suspense, "Die Another Day" may just be for you.

We will never know how "Star Trek" would have fared had it gone to a fourth season, but chances are--based on the mostly lackluster third season--it would have been forgettable. To be sure, there are some high quality episodes--"The Enterprise Incident," "Day of the Dove," and "The Tholian Web" among them--but the show clearly strays too far from its dramatic beginnings. William Shatner, looking about ten years older than when the series started just two years before, slips too often into the swaggering, staccato-voiced mode for which he is so frequently parodied today, and Leonard Nimoy seems content to play Spock with little or none of the subtext he'd created during the first two seasons. And though most of the episodes have a somber tone, the stories seem culled mostly from the pages of cheap comic books and "B" movies, right down to someone's brain getting stolen. Coasting along on a combination of the momentum of the previous seasons and the chemistry among the cast, "Star Trek's" third season is a disappointing end to an otherwise terrific series, even if it is more watchable than most of the franchise series that followed it.

Space Nazis, alternate universes, interstellar Roman societies, a gangster planet complete with zoot suits and Tommy guns--the second season of "Star Trek" certainly relies on more fantastic premises than the first, making it colorful but less intellectual on the whole. Nonetheless, thought-provoking episodes like "Amok time, "The Ultimate Computer," and "Journal to Babel" join action potboilers like "Obsession" and "The Doomsday Machine" to make an entertaining season. By this time, it's clear the actors have settled into their roles and though the performances and direction sometimes feel routine, William Shatner and others are still effective. The subdued, "frontier" atmosphere of the first season is also replaced by brighter cinematography and jauntier music; combined with a faster pace and greater emphasis on action, episodes are less "weighty" by comparison, and there are even forays into broad comedy like "I, Mudd" and "The Trouble with Tribbles." The series would continue to lose its original dramatic focus, so that by the third season, "Star Trek" is mostly a sketch of its former self. Still, the original series is superior creatively and dramatically to those that followed--and audiences raised on recent television shows are likely to find its second season closer in spirit to today's programming.

Despite its terrific performances and excellent pacing, "Erin Brockovich" proves most of all that no matter how trashy, foul-mouthed or self-absorbed a good-looking white woman is, she will always come out on top, especially if she puts her best boobs forward. Roberts is perfectly cast as the titular (no pun intended) character, a 30-something ex-beauty queen with the mouth of a truck driver and the body of a Barbie doll, as well as its sense of responsibility. Down on her luck after two failed marriages (surprise), three kids (surprise) and no money in the bank (surprise), Brockovich hooks up with a broken down ambulance chaser (played marvelously by the always affable Albert Finney) following a car accident that may have been her fault. After practically extorting a job from Finney, she latches onto the plight of a California town, whose bumpkinish residents have been slow-poisoned by the local power utility. The movie wants to tell a David-and-Goliath story about a "common" woman taking on the big, bad corporation, but too often the motives of Brocovich get clouded by her self-indulgent behavior. For instance, she routinely dumps her kids on whoever will watch them, including a scary-looking but kind-hearted biker who just wants a girlfriend that's actually around. Though she claims her crusade is for the residents--she even seems to sacrifice her health for the case--ego seems to be more the impetus, as she basks in the adulation of the townspeople and takes generous swipes at anyone with a formal education, all while routinely running as far away from her own family as possible. And she expects a big check in the end. I just don't buy into the cockeyed moral center of the movie, no matter how much gritty charm Roberts brings to the lead role. Ultimately, of course, Brockovich triumphs, but the movie makes it clear that its her looks and aggression that open doors for her. True to life? Probably. But so is cancer. Doesn't mean I want it or need to see it.

Nicolas Cage hasn't made a great movie since "Raising Arizona." And that's not hyperbole.I don't count "The Wicker Man" re-make, which was great for all the wrong reasons, and I suppose given that I generally have to be drunk or desperate to be willing to watch Cage at all, I haven't seen everything he has done . . . but the best people can hope for is that Cage just stay out of way of the stunts and the set pieces, as in the "National Treasure" movies.So, why should "Windtalkers" be any different?After all, this is a beautifully shot but intellectually vapid take on World War Two. Notice that I didn't say on the contributions of Navajo to the victories in World War Two, victories -- and this is not hyperbole -- that would have been unlikely without their contribution. The irony of people the government once tried to exterminate and discrimate(d) openly against nonetheless expecting them to do their "patriotic duty" when it benefited the very same government is lost in a movie that instead focuses mostly on Cage brooding or being pursued by a decidedly non-Navajo nurse. Nor is there understanding of the irony that the Navajo -- presented here with reasonable dignity but not depth -- will be led not by one of their own but by a former high school deliquent and screw-up suffering from PTSD. (A telling example is where Cage's character decides to blow up one of the Windtalkers rather than let him be taken prisoner . . . an action that becomes pointless when the battle is soon over and with victory for the Americans; this is after he receives a medal for valor, of course.) My dad was in the Army, and this smacks of the kind of thinking that made him decide to not make it his career.What we get instead is John Woo's obsession with acrobatics and slow-motion shots that often border on parody in a movie recounting historical events. James Horner's mostly overplayed score -- except for the "Saving private Ryan"-esque overture and the occasional haunting "flutes" -- doesn't help. It's like watching kids playing war with a lot more money and their own soundtrack. I already blame Woo for "inspiring" hacks like Michael Bay, but his inability to understand restraint with action turns a film that could, despite Cage, have been a dramatic winner. A few scenes, such as when Roger Willie and Christian Slater in character play music together over a montage actually work. The script by John Rice and Joe Batteer, however, seems at moments to want to tell a different story than Woo does.The rest of the cast deserves to be in a better movie, especially Adam Beach, who has the quiet presence of Audie Murphy or Neville Brand, real deal heroes. He should have been the focus of this film and not Cage. Even Slater, who turns in good performances, gets slighted. But with so little on the actual contributions of the Navajo, the film follows the standard course of making what should be supporting characters the stars and vice versa.That's yet another indignity the Windtalkers must face.

As big a classic film buff as I am, I'm ashamed to say I'd never seen "From Here to Eternity" in its entirety until recently -- and have been kicking myself ever since for not watching it sooner. The bits I'd seen over the years showed great acting, certainly, but the story seemed too soap opera. I was wrong. It's less soap opera and more tragedy, and in this, fleshed out characters who are nuanced and sympathetic dominate. Though most people think of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr as the stars, their famous beach scene notwithstanding, Montgomery Clift is the true headliner, whose nobly off-kilter Private Prewitt charts a doomed course toward redemption, with borderline prostitute Donna Reed and scrappy friend Frank Sinatra in tow. To discuss it further is to give too much away, but if there's a theme that dominates the film, it's "too little, too late," as characters embroiled in a hot bed of human relationships miss opportunities because they hesitate. The cast is impeccable, from the steely but humane Lancaster to the gleefully sadistic Ernest Borgnine to the lovely and affecting Kerr and Reed. If there is a weakness to "From Here to Eternity," it lies in the inability to blend the cultures that make Hawaii such a beautiful place -- the story is so mono-cultural, it might as well have been set in Kansas and doesn't resemble the Hawaii that I know. Still, this Fred Zinnemann-directed potboiler deserves the accolades it has received over the years. It's not a happy story by any means but it may still give you a sense of joy to watch it.

Perhaps it was only Bill Hader's loopy impersonation on this otherwise tedious season of "Saturday Night Live" that got me craving Vincent Price movies, but there's no doubt that the Phibes ones are among the late, great actor's more memorable. Ancestors to the mercilessly grim "Seven," these campy gems feature Price as a mostly dead genius seeking to revive his completely dead wife, all while exacting revenge of Biblical inspiration on his foes. It's tough to characterize the Phibes films and do justice, or to discuss them without spoiling too much suspense; they are one part comedy, one part horror, and one part fantasy of "The Avengers" kind, right down to the Spartan depiction of England, in this case the roaring 1920s filled with myriad anachronisms. The better of the two films, "The Abominable Dr. Phibes," has more thrills and chills than its sequel, "Dr. Phibes Rises Again," because of a more expensive production and because Joseph Cotton adds a gravitas that Robert Quarry does not. But both films feature wonderful supporting casts, including delightful Peter Jeffrey as dotty flatfoot Inspector Trout, as well as veteran actors like Terry-Thomas, Hugh Griffiths, and Peter Cushing. (Keen eyes will spot a completely wasted John Thaw, though, as well as sex bomb Caroline Munro as Phibes' wife.) Director Robert Fuest, a British TV veteran, brings a simple, stylish gloss to the film that is often blunted by strains of sadness so common to early 1970s films. My guess is that Price was a sweet man in real life -- it's easy to see him and the cast having fun, despite the mayhem -- and his Phibes seems less the villain because of it. Ironically, his victims often seem more horrible than he does, which gives both films an antihero subtext that questions who the real monsters in life are.

First the good news: Billy Wilder's wonderfully comic--and tragic--examination of the romantic life of "the world's greatest consulting detective," Sherlock Holmes, is reproduced beautifully in this terrific and long overdue DVD. Indeed, "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" has never looked better or more complete on the small screen, as it is presented here in a digitally remastered widescreen format that preserves the integrity of director and co-writer Wilder's original vision. As fans of the film know, Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond fill in the blanks regarding the sexual orientation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous literary creation (a hot topic among intellectuals in the late 1960s) with both a sparkling wit and grand sense of respect for the subject matter. In the film, Holmes embarks on his most scandalous case, which includes the search for a missing engineer, the discovery of secrets of state, and his burgeoning love for a mysterious woman who might not be who she claims. With his lisp and penchant for sarcasm, Robert Stephens' Holmes is less the classical hero than in previous screen versions, going so far as to chide Watson (played wonderfully by Colin Blakely) for embellishing both his habits and physical stature in his "Strand Magazine" articles, yet Stephens' Holmes retains the keen mind, loyal affability, and vulnerable spirit we have come to admire. The supporting cast, which includes Christopher Lee as Mycroft Holmes, is excellent, but it is the production, including Miklos Rosza's hauntingly luscious score, that helps propel the film to greatness. Now, the bad news: As most fans know, Wilder wanted this film to be more than three hours long and contain several other adventures that would complete this heretofore unknown set of cases whose "delicate and sometimes scandalous nature" made them unsuitable for print. Unfortunately, the studio forced him to cut much of that footage, only some of which is included here (and without sound; in other cases, stills of filmed scenes are intercut with pages of the script and recorded dialogue). The result is that those of us who have waited for years to see the film as the brilliant Wilder had intended it have to make due with the bits and pieces included here. What a shame that, once again, marketing interfered with the artistic process.

If you're selfish and self-absorbed (but don't know it), you'll probably love this colorful film about a single mother's 25-year climb to the best-seller list. If not, you'll probably just shake your head. The problem with "Riding in Cars with Boys" isn't that it lacks charm or humor; the problem is that it suggests that charm and humor in a person should supplant good judgment, character and sensitivity--even when that person is responsible for someone else. Drew Barrymore gives her standard perky performance as Beverly Donofrio, a headstrong girl who defies her blue-collar parents (James Woods and Lorraine Bracco in interesting bits) and quickly finds herself pregnant. Opting for marriage to a soon-to-be-junky loser (played effectively by Steve Zahn), Bev struggles to get to college but not before developing an angry Martyr Complex about her son and dabbling in the drug trade. The movie's flashback scenes between the now successful Bev and the brash young woman she once was are at times effective--she actually seems a bit smarter and more sensitive in her youth--but too often we're supposed to chuckle at her poor decisions rather than hold her responsible for them. In fact, the film seems to dodge the tougher question of why we should care about Bev in the first place, as she simply drifts from one crisis to the next, especially when her now-grown son points out all of the psychological trauma being her son has caused. I guess it's supposed to be all that nostalgic music and Bev's pluck or maybe that she's a single parent. It's nice that things work out for her in the end--the film is apparently based on an autobiography--but viewers may be left with little sense that the character deserves success so much as fell into it. In terms of drama, that seems pretty weak.

Though few people in the cast even remotely resemble the people they portray--one would think that Wil Smith, in particular, is just too homely to play the baby-faced Ali, well known for comments about his looks and those of others--Michael Mann's take on the legendary fighter's life merits viewing for many reasons, not the least of which is its determination to focus on Ali as a man rather than a black man. Sure, racism, civil rights, the influence of Islam, and other issues, perhaps, common in films about the experiences of African Americans turn up, but they never overshadow the focus on Ali as a human being whose combination of bravado and personal ethics made him either a role model or a pariah to so many people in the 1960s and 1970s. Surprisingly, the usually lightweight Smith delivers a complex and generally satisfying performance as Ali, showing the man's inner strength with a quiet determination, even if in his more boisterous moments Smith borders on caricature. (The major weakness of the film is that too many characters come across as caricatures, Jon Voight's muppet-like Howard Cosell being the worst offender.) The rest of the cast, including Jamie Foxx, Ron Silver, Joe Morton, Mykelti Williams and other familiar faces, deliver the goods, though Nona Gaye, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Michael Michelle shine in particular as the women in Ali's life. And while its fight scenes never equal those of either &quot;Rocky&quot; or &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; the visceral moments of the film still carry great weight, in part because of the effective score and in part because Mann captures reasonably well the look and feel of the period without any &quot;Miami Vice&quot; gloss.

I have to admit that Martin Scorcese's "Gangs of New York" threw me; on the one hand, it's one of the more brilliantly cinematic American films to come along in years, with more in common with the sense of artistic maturity known to films 40 years ago than the usual scatterbrained claptrap boxed up and shipped stinking to theaters today. One can see strains of the great international directors, too, from David Lean to Akira Kurasawa to Bernardo Bertulucci in Scorcese's vision, though he seems to equally raid the Mad Max sequels, stockpiles of Victorian Era clipart, and everyone's favorite muckraker, Upton Sinclair. On the other hand, I felt like the story of European immigrants and their unending hostility to each other and everyone else has been told so many times in one form or another that a roll of the eyes was in order. And it's still another gangster movie. I finally came down on the film being closer to the superb side. That the main plot ultimately boils down to a simple revenge story--and, too often, I did not care about the plight of its characters, who are more animals than people, even with their hypocritical pretensions of civilization--is surmounted by a tour de force of acting and spectacle, most of it driven by Scorcese's attention to period detail. In short, the director is in top form as a visualist, certainly better than in the much-hyped but dramatically weaker "The Aviator." He's so good here, he manages to get a watchable performance out of Leonardo DiCaprio, but thinking-man's villain Daniel Day-Lewis and batty rumpshaker Cameron Diaz are the showhorses in this lavish production about the sociopathic goings-on in the crime-ridden slums of Old New York. It's not the sort of film I'd need to watch twice, but it certainly held my attention more than I would have expected.

Not having seen the television show it's based on -- but well aware of its grand reputation among many sci-fi fans -- I watched "Serenity" with great expectations. Perhaps too great. The film is reasonably crafted but nothing groundbreaking, as pretty much all of the contemporary cliches are there: wisecracking crew, ramshackle spaceship, snarky interpersonal relationships, an oppressive galactic empire, rather slow and clumsy martial arts, and so on. The film offers a few surprises, but even they seem borrowed from other projects. Shades of the famous scene in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the put-upon, Han Solo-esque captain, for instance, shoots his apparently unarmed adversary rather than get into a prolonged fight . . . the difference here is that it leads to a prolonged fight anyway. The production is an ADHD combination of elements, something of a pastiche of "Star Wars" tossed with "Blade Runner" and an odd American western sensibility mixed with some troublng eastern subtexts. (I asked someone about this and, apparently, Asians are the primary architects of this dypstopian future, which at least partially explains yet another nearly all Anglo spaceship crew.)Now, the more important issue: Does it all work? For the most part and taken for what it is, which is to say shoot-'em-up sci-fi, yes. Though "Serenity" feels like a TV show, except for some requisite scenes of exposition in the middle, it moves at a fast enough pace for viewers to overlook its shortcomings. The cast is competent if relatively unknown (I did recognize Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass), even if they look a bit like second-tier soap opera types or porn stars. A standout is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who makes for a particularly icy villain. The plot moves toward an intense climax that is satisfying if open-ended, again not surprising for a production based on a television show . . . perhaps one in hopes of being resurrected, a la "Star Trek." In many ways, I wouldn't mind that happening.

I must confess a soft spot for what should have been just another throw-away 80s teenage comedy--"Mischief" rises above the usual raunchy, unauthentic junk that pervaded the decade of my own high school experience. With a sweet center that belies its sometimes very adult (but refreshingly honest) presentation, the film walks a fine line between maudlin and moving and in the end is just plain satisfying. Doug McKeon ("On Golden Pond") is Jonathan, a smart but socially awkward teenager growing up in bucolic Nelsonville, Ohio (a real place, though rather more drab and gray than presented here). His ongoing quest for a lusty encounter with the class sexpot (the lovely, lovely Kelly Preston) gets a boost when a thoughtful "bad boy," Gene (Chris Nash), moves into the neighborhood, and the two outcasts become good friends. Gene agrees to teach Jonathan some better moves and when Gene falls in love with the girl-next-door (Catherine Mary Stuart), it's Jonathan's turn to help make a relationship happen. There's not much in the story that isn't predictable--and today's jaded teenagers will likely find the plot corny and simplistic--but the execution in "Mischief" is so charming that viewers get treated to a rarity: a teen comedy with a heart. Great performances, a wonderful 1950s-style production, and a stellar soundtrack (that appears to have never been released in any form . . . pity) certainly help, but it's probably the fact that the teenagers here actually seem like teenagers, with that strange mixture of innocence, neediness, and horniness, rather than cynical, know-it-all adults, that makes the film work. Believe me, in 1985, that feat alone was remarkable. That it fizzled at the box office may have had more to do with poor marketing than poor filmmaking.

I had the pleasure of hearing Barry play a snippet of Roger Sessions' work live recently and was impressed. Barry brings to the piano a sense of both passion for the music and respect for the composer, ensuring a memorable, moving performance. If you can't hear Barry play live -- and even if you can -- check out this CD.

"Deadwood" is essentially "The Sopranos" meets "True Grit" -- its principal crime boss, Al Swearengen (played with enormous charisma by Ian McShane) runs his criminal empire with the same zeal and frustration as that other HBO sociopath, Tony. The dialogue has the crippled formality of "True Grit" (and, later, "Lonesome Dove"), sounding both simple-minded and ornate at the same time, even though certain terms, such as the euphemism for, um, oral gratification, probably didn't exist in 1876, and the efforts to sometimes avoid obvious racist terms by substituting perhaps less offensive euphemisms borders on comical. That's okay, as the rest of the show at least feels authentic enough that you want to believe you're watching something historical. The first season starts out very strong, with a premiere episode that not only sets up the characters, but provides genuine tension in the conflicts. As the season wears on, especially after the departure of a major character, the show suffers from some of the same problems as "The Sopranos," in that the ongoing, by this point soap-opery conflicts have simmered too long without meaningful resolution. The cast, including Keith Carradine, Tim Olymphant, Robin Weigert, William Sanderson, and Brad Dourif, is excellent, providing colorful characterizations without going over-the-top. Anyone who's picked up a Time/Life book on the Old West will find a lot of the trappings familiar, and though the show is yet another in a seemingly endless line of programs about European expansion into the frontier, yet again told from the European point of view, the lengths it goes to to show the immorality of the period is refreshing. These are not morality tales, however, but ones about power, certainly an element of Old West mythology that generally goes overlooked. Graphic on pretty much all fronts, "Deadwood" also favors a particular word beginning with "C" . . . let's just say that there are few words I know that are more likely to offend people, especially women I know. You've been warned. The first half of the season rates a solid 5. The second half brings the overall rating about to a 4.

Like so many fine Americans, I once found Leonard DiCaprio pretty cringeworthy. He is one of dozens of manufactured stars in this Walmarty age, the result of a conspiracy between Hollywood agent and producer types to Manchurian Candidate us into unhealthy disregard for DiCaprio's straight-out-of-drama-club talent. Agonizingly, it worked on quite a few people, and the occasional fluke, such as his charming turn in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?", gave maddening rise to hope that he could, indeed, be the star we hallucinated he was. ("Leonardo DiCaprio is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most remarkable actor I've ever known in my life.") When he got shot in the face in "The Departed," though, I was torn -- I had been waiting to see such a moment with him (or Tom Cruise, or Will Smith, or the Jonas Brothers) most of my life, yet I could also see him now doing more than just showing up on set, babbling lines, and squinting. Could he, indeed, be a bonafide actor? Could I finally forgive him for "Titanic" and "The Man in the Iron Mask"? Well, I watched "Body of Lies" with optimism that DiCaprio might bring something worth two hours of my life to the screen. The good news is that he did. In fact, this is one of DiCaprio's better performances (which on one hand isn't saying much, but on the other suggests that after 30 or 40 films, he might finally be getting the hang of the acting thing). I wish I could say the same for Russell Crowe, a far more talented actor who seems relegated here to looking sinisterly paunchy, as though on an evil quest for his next breakfast burrito. It helps that he has an evil wardrobe courtesy of JCPenney. The problem with "Body of Lies" really isn't either actor, nor anyone else in a competent cast, but a script that wants to be John LeCarre when it's barely John Grisham -- mumbo-jumbo CIA dirty dealings in the Mideast. Ridley Scott, whose films frequently sacrifice narrative depth for what seem increasingly less impressive visuals, gets mileage out of a torture scene, but the rest of the film is like outtakes from "The Constant Gardener." It's worth checking out from the library, but plan on stretching viewings out over a couple of nights, as you will probably want to pause the film to attend to such urgencies as walking the dog or defrosting the refrigerator. One very bright spot is the stunning Golshifteh Farahani, who shines in every scene she is in and transports us back to a time when the movie industry looked for loveliness rather than marketability in female leads.

After recently sitting rather painfully through the overhyped and underwhelming "Erin Brocovich," I got to see this little gem of a film--thank goodness! "The Road Home" is everything that "Erin Brockovich" isn't: genuine, moving, sensitive, inspirational. Sure, the charming and enormously talented Zhang Ziyi ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") doesn't shove her {body] in everyone's face, but then she doesn't have to. She has true substance (and reminds one of a young Audrey Hepburn), creating a character in this film so charismatically decent that it makes the eponymous Brocovich look like a truck stop dumpster. Ziyi plays Di, a determined, soulful farmgirl who falls in love with a kindly schoolteacher (Zheng Hao), sent to her village in 1950s China. Told in flashback by their son (Sun Honglei), we discover that despite many obstacles the two marry, an unusual circumstance in a time of arranged marriages, and it is upon the death of the schoolteacher 40 years later while trying to raise money for his school that the second part of the story begins: that of a son honoring his father. With no explosions, drug use, foul language, or graphic sex, "The Road Home" has only real emotions for its fuel, and yet under the steady hand of director Zhang Yimou, the film makes a bigger impression than any tinny Hollywood blockbuster I've seen in the last ten years. If you want to see a romance that shines light upon what is truly valuable in life, see this film!

John Ford westerns are transcendent, a word I wouldn't use to describe much of anything unless I meant it. He had a visual style that one moment could be as basic and authentic as the cowboy himself, and just as iconic, and downright arty and lyrical the next. Film buffs tend to point to his earliest work, such as "Stagecoach," and his epic color work, such as "The Searchers," as his best films, and I admire them certainly but lean toward his often black-and-white work in the 40s and 50s as the most consistently well crafted, where he seemed more at ease with the work.A lot of contradictions exist about the man himself, who ran the gamut from chummy to fatherly to tyrannical depending on who is being interviewed and when. And it's sometimes hard to say how much of what Ford did onscreen was deliberate versus what might have been cribbed from someone else or just plain happenstance. But we have the end products, more than 100 of them, most of them good, and some of them masterpieces."Two Rode Together" falls short in a lot of ways. The script is clumsy and rife with muddle-headed racial politics that want to condemn racism at the same time the film paternalistically reaffirms for its audience their superiority over anyone non-white - more or less what we have today in a Hollywood movie, but Ford had already examined the same themes better and with as much generosity as the times would have in "The Searchers." There are moments when characters seem genuinely confused as to their purpose in the plot, a condition exacerbated by Ford's effort to draw too many light-hearted moments from leads Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark. Both are in good form, especially the under-rated Widmark, who was born with a face for villainy but retained elements of sensitivity in his expressions that many people miss. But even together, neither is charismatic enough to give the talky movie momentum.The plot involves a rascally town marshal helping a cavalry troop find white children presumably taken prisoner in years-ago Comanche raids. While there's comic relief from the likes of Andy Devine, whose body type is the anatomical equivalent of a Hershey's Kiss, the soldiers here are mostly extras in spiffy blue shirts, without the Remington-esque romanticizing in Ford's earlier films like "Fort Apache" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon." Woody Strode, so able in Ford's "Sergeant Rutledge," is criminally misused as a renegade chief, and the women (Shirley Jones and Linda Cristal), while cute, fail to provide sparks. Perhaps the most powerful scene in the film involves a lynching, but its pathos stumbles as the scene marvels at the "savagery" of being the "other" while shoving us toward the ineffective clich&eacute; of who the real savages are. That would come better in the brilliant tragicomedy "Little Big Man" less than a decade later.While Ford still had one or two good films left in him, by the time "Two Rode Together" was made, he seemed less interested in projects. Even the oft-regarded one-camera take of an allegedly ad-libbed scene between Stewart and Widmark seems more gimmicky than artful. (Compare it to similar takes in "Lawrence of Arabia," for instance, to see the difference.) "Two Rode Together" is worth a look if you're a Ford fan, but don't expect too much, or you'll probably watch it with a hint of sadness.

With its stark re-creation of the massacre of Native Americans at the hands of a volunteer U.S. Army during the American Civil War, it's no surprise that &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; has been largely buried by cable and broadcast TV. When a local station was brave enough to air it--uncensored, no less--years ago, I was stunned at the depiction not only of sadistic violence, but overt racism and genocide that most westerns have chosen to whitewash or ignore to avoid offending mainstream audiences. That said, it's not easy to watch &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; without recoiling at the visciousness of so-called civilized people who defended their actions by labelling everyone else &quot;savages.&quot; Peter Strauss plays a wayward cavalry soldier who teams up with a frontier-savvy immigrant (Candice Bergen) on the eve of a brutal attack by the army (based loosely on Chivington's massacre of the Cheyenne at Sand Creek) He quickly comes to realize who the real savages are but is nonetheless powerless to prevent the gleeful slaughter that includes rape and dismemberment. &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; may remind viewers of &quot;Little Big Man&quot; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;--and there are striking similarities--but despite their higher production values, neither film seems to capture the sheer venom of actions and attitudes against Native Americans. (The film itself stops short of depicting the full range of brutality.) Still, &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; is far from a perfect film--the acting at times is over-the-top and the parallels to the Viet Nam War (think: My Lai Massacre) detract from the film's focus. Watch it not as great cinema but as a glimpse of an American West we usually don't get to see.

Sam Mendes' turgid adapation of "The Road to Perdition" embodies much of what makes modern American cinema so one note. It's not a bad film exactly, but its ponderously sad tone wears thin after the first half hour, which spends most of its time setting up what amounts to a predictable chase around the countryside. Weird-looking but surprisingly popular lead Tom Hanks plays what has become a contemporary archetype: hit man with a heart. The twist here is that after his son witnesses a shootout in which Sullivan (Hanks), along with the spineless lump (Daniel Craig) who is the boss's (a grumbling Paul Newman) son, gun down a set-up lackey and his gang, it's the Sullivans who become targets. Like Mendes' other blockbuster, "American Beauty," the clich&eacute;s come hard and fast, as do the Irish and Italian stereotypes, and the plot goes exactly where one expects it to, with lines equally forecasted (showing its graphic novel roots). The beachside showdown at the end with a determined hit man (Jude Law) who spends more time in his hotel room than on the job - and who wears a funny hat - seems more merciful than poignant, in that it puts a capper onto a film that probably went on half an hour longer than it should have. Ultimately, "The Road to Perdition" may best be remembered as the film that showed us a pre-James Bond Craig, whose performance here suggests he may have the chops to pull the character off, if not the looks, as he just seems too wan and blonde for the ruggedly handsome 007.

When I was a child, mini-series were all the rage, but while so many people talked about "Shogun" (for all the wrong reasons -- it is a magnificent work, but I recall people being most dazzled because it showed beheadings on TV), another one better captured my attention: "Masada." The story of defiant Jews holed up in a mountain fortress while a Roman legion lay siege was riveting, not just for its great script and the stunning performances by Peter Strauss and Peter O'Toole, but because of Jerry Goldsmith's epic soundtrack. Even as a child, I recognized the quality of this work, rather moreso than most TV of the time, and the noble overture of "Masada" has stayed with me all these years. So it was with trepidation that I acquired the soundtrack recently. Sometimes revisiting what impressed you in childhood is better not done.Not in this case, as I was pleased to find that not only did the music still give me chills, but it was actually even better than I remember. Here there is sweep, beauty, courage, mystery, tragedy, redemption, and legend, all in musical form, and there is not a weak link on the entire CD (which, as others have posted, unfortunately does not contain all of the music of the mini-series). In fact, it is my favorite of Goldsmith's many, many wonderful soundtracks. A close listen might reveal moments that are reminiscent of or forecast his tracks for "In Like Flint," "Star Trek," "The Wind and the Lion," "Conan, the Barbarian," and "Total Recall," with a bit of Jarre's "Lawrence of Arabia" and other influences, but for my money, this is Jerry Goldsmith's warhorse, his most realized musical vision, and if he had done nothing else in his brilliant career, not "Patton," or "The Edge" or even "The Man from UNCLE," I think he could have rested quite comfortably on the merits of this one composition. Perhaps that is an exaggeration, but listen and judge for yourself.

Sean Connery returns to the role that made him a movie star in "Never Say Never Again," a re-imagining of 1965's "Thunderball" that was possible because of a bitter lawsuit against Ian Fleming. The results are mixed. The strengths of "Never Say Never Again" include wonderfully effective performances by confident Connery, sexy Barbara Carrera, and wily Klaus Maria Brandauer--in fact, had the three been dropped into a stronger production, the film would probably be heralded as one of the best of the series--as well as wit and style that were increasingly missing from the Moore films. The weaknesses include a miscast Kim Basinger, an uninspired score by Michel LeGrand, and a lethargic pace that is off-putting, at best. As in "Thunderball," Bond is called forth to stop the attempts of a megalomaniacal billionaire and SPECTRE agent to blackmail the world with weapons of mass destruction. Along the way, he rescues the misguided sister of a NATO bomber pilot who was seduced into the caper by a pyschotic femme fatale. At 52, Connery plays an aging but virile Bond with the right mixture of humor and world-weariness; his Bond clearly is meant for the grown-ups in the audience. Yet, director Irvin Kirschner's choice to keep the film's pace geriatric makes it far more plodding than the original, which was also at times rather slow. Without Bond standards like the famous guitar-theme--or something to approximate them--too many scenes feel further robbed of their essence, nice looking as they are. Even the brief appearance by Max Von Sydow as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, here closer to the character described in the books than ever before, and some well-crafted action sequences can't quite pull "Never Say Never Again" out of its narrative slumber.

Few adaptations of Doyle's famed detective franchise stray as far from the original as this one, even if its plot borrows too often from a better distraction, "Young Sherlock Holmes." In "Sherlock: Case of Evil," we get the Gen-X version of the sleuth's adventures--blank stares that are supposed to represent some sort of cryptic angst, needlessly angry characters whose inability to get along quickly grows tiresome, and a production that meanders between parody (a scene where a sex-hungry Victorian takes forever to strip herself of undergarments is almost Mel Brooks-like) and homage (including scenes and setups that appear to have been swiped from "Moonraker," "The Third Man," "A Study in Terror," a Discovery Channel special on Cold War spies, and the aforementioned Barry Levinson project). It isn't that James D'Arcy (terrific in "Master and Commander: Far Side of the World") is awful as Holmes--he just isn't Holmes in either appearance or behavior. From indulging in absinthe to having threesomes to springing into action only after a tragedy has occured, he seems more a creation of Brett Easton Ellis than Arthur Conan Doyle. Robert Morlidge does slightly better, despite his constant scowl--a minor brilliance here is that instead of being bumbling or clueless, his Watson keeps coming to completely reasonable--but wrong--conclusions about the future, such as the subway completely replacing personal vehicles or tobacco being outlawed because, unlike cocaine or morphine, it has no medicinal value. But Vincent D'Onofrio's Harry Lime-esque Dr. Moriarty is so flamboyant and theatrical, he makes the Jon Lovitz thespian character on "Saturday Night Live" look like Lee Strasberg. The murky plot has something to do with Moriarty somehow finding time to invent heroin in between maiming Holme's brother, Mycroft, and faking his own death a couple times. The first half of the film nearly put me to sleep, but the second half picks up substantially in both pace and sensibility, nearly making up for the time wasted, even if Holmes somehow seems to find ammunition in a revolver that a few moments before was empty (unless I missed something--which is possible, as I was droopy-eyed by that point.) For the most part, "Sherlock: Case of Evil" is a well-photographed but amateurish mess with a few moments of interest . . . about what to expect nowadays.

While "Star Trek: First Contact" rewrites too much of the original TV series' history--a debilitating addiction the current production people can't seem to shake--it delivers a rollicking adventure that is more in keeping with Captain Kirk's episodes than any other "TNG" film. That's really good because on TV, talky Captain Picard and crew often seemed better suited for Monday morning board meetings than the intergalactic perils of space opera. In this one, a race of cybernauts called the Borg decide to revise Earth history by stopping the first human excursion with warp drive. Picard and crew follow the aliens back in time, meeting with a cynical, drunken inventor (a laconic James Cromwell) who revises their assessment of his place in history. Unlike the other TNG films, this one's plotted more like a film than a TV show, meaning that the pace is less likely to put you to sleep, even if Star Trek still can't quite escape cornball humor or pure cheese. (How many times does Data have to discover his humanity or Worf be told he's a warrior worthy of respect? Why do characters rely so often on a pregnant pause and one last line before exiting? Just how much technobabble can we really take?) The regular cast is as good as it's always been--which is to say, adequate--but Alice Krige stands out as the creepily sexy Borg queen and though she's frequently bug-eyed with excitement, Alfre Woodard deserves more screen time as Picard's potential love interest. The real stars here, though, are Jonathan Frakes as director, who seems to actually understand and respect the material he's working with, and Jerry Goldsmith, whose score is among the better in the series. When the humans meet up with a surprise alien race at the end, the moment might actually give you goosebumps.

Paul Shrader's "Auto Focus" should have been a better movie than it turned out to be. For starters, it's hard to get past the fact that Greg Kinnear looks nothing like Bob Crane; Kinnear's narrow face and aw shucks expression mismatches Crane's boyish demeanor and beguiling, if smug, looks, and the hair is styled and even parted the wrong way. In fact, everyone except the chunky actor portraying the late Werner Klemperer just seems coarse and bony when compared to their real life counterparts. My, how times have changed. In much the same way, the rest of "Auto Focus" is anemic somehow, mostly because the script focuses on the broad strokes of Crane's tragic life, without subtlety or nuance. Further, the sex and nudity are devoid of spark, which seems odd in a film designed to explore the lure of sexual addiction. Clearly, it's a low-budget film, and while the re-creation of the "Hogan's Heroes" sets are nostalgic, the other elements seem a parody of late 1960s through mid-1970s fad and fashion, like the more recent "Brady Bunch" sets and costumes. The result is that "Auto Focus" never quite feels enough like a docudrama to elicit tears and never quite enough like a parody to elicit laughs, which left me unsatisfied. Even the presence of Willem DaFoe--appropriately pathetic here--can't quite lift "Auto Focus" to the heights it seeks.

Betty Davis is an acquired taste . . . she wasn't exactly pretty, despite what the Kim Carnes song might argue, and her voice and demeanor generally were that of fingernails on the chalkboard. If you like that sort of thing -- if you generally confuse being abrasive with being powerful or charismatic, for instance -- then Davis is something of an icon. In this film, she pulls off a minor miracle, heavily made up to be both an ingenue and a Diphtheria survivor. (In truth, a portrait of her is lovelier than the real thing.) Davis would be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance, which drifts from quite good, especially as she plays a much older Fanny Skeffington getting her just desserts, to borderline campy as she inhabits a character that is seemingly the precursor to her turn in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" The real money is on the always-great Claude Rains as her far-too-proper and yet far-too-understanding husband, appropriately named Job, whose mixed marriage (he's Jewish, she's not, an idea that gets wedged into the plot) includes the fact that he loves her and she only loves herself. There are elements of "Mrs. Skeffington" you've seen before -- in many ways, the plot reworks "Gone with the Wind," with a vain, selfish girl taking advantage of an older and more genuine man, but the story here is more cold-blooded, and in this respect, perhaps more honest. Despite the sometimes awkward light moments, there is little romantic about "Mrs. Skeffington"; even the ending seems more about symbiosis than love. Yet the payoff is worth the sometimes trivial excesses that lead up to it. The sets and props are quite elegant, though, and Franz Waxman's and Paul Dessau's score is often quite moving. I rarely say that old movies should be remade, but this one is ripe for it, as Davis' portrayal is more of a technical feat than a truly moving one and Vincent Sherman's direction is only just above par. Imagine a remake with, say, Emily Blount in the lead role. Of course, someone of Claude Rains' caliber doesn't really exist anymore, but they could probably get by with Geoffrey Rush or Daniel Day-Lewis in the role, albeit a lot more dry. Let Paul Thomas Anderson direct it.

I usually run screaming from anything on the bestseller list -- after all, such lists usually are not so much arbiters of good taste as they are the result of rather narrowly focused efforts by marketers to get a handful of titles they deem worthy to shelves and the subsequent book orders by vendors. Those with an inside track see their books pushed and, thus, many finer works are never even given a chance. That said, a student passed "Freakonomics" to me, and I found it tough to put down. The reading style is spritely, and Levitt's conclusions are, in general, quite fascinating. He essentially frames (or, perhaps, reframes) data sets of many kinds -- student test scores, real estate earnings, drug dealers' sales and payoffs -- coming to what might best be called counterintuitive but seemingly inescapable conclusions. Readers will likely be surprised to discover Levitt's views on the connection between parenting and how a child actually turns out or how the Roe versus Wade decision affected violent crime decades later. Still, Levitt is no sociologist, and along with making rather sweeping assumptions about human nature in his manipulation of data, his focus on quantitative rather than qualitative analyses reveals many shortcomings. It's tough to take him seriously, for instance, when he suggests something other than racism may be responsible when resumes with "black" names are far less likely to get an interview than those with "white" names -- even though all of the other details are identical. Of course, scholars are a lot like magicians in that their performances give the illusion of total mastery of the subject matter. If they really knew as much as they claim, the scholars would have solved all of the world's problems a long time ago, just as the magician who really can pass through walls would have cleaned out all of the world's banks by now. As it stands, Levitt's book offers a lot to think about, some things to smile about, a few things to groan about, and one or two things that might at best be good icebreakers at a cocktail party. Like books by Malcolm Gladwell (whose gushing about "Freakonomics" is cited on the back cover), Levitt's book succeeds on several levels, but perhaps most in providing highbrow trivia.

With its grim tone and gritty production values, Lewis Milestone's &quot;The Halls of Montezuma&quot; is a strong entry in the annals of Hollywood war films, marred only by its almost propagandistically negative portrayal of the Japanese. The underrated Richard Widmark plays a determined patrol leader (and former teacher--shades of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;) who leads his men in what seems the fruitless search for a Japanese rocket base that is showering destruction upon his fellow Marines. A great ensemble cast of such now familiar faces as Karl Malden, Jack Webb, Martin Milner, Richard Boone, and Jack Palance share his onscreen struggles, which include the typical tragedies of war (shown in relatively graphic ways for the time). The stench of death nearly permeates the screen in &quot;The Halls of Montezuma,&quot; punctuating each scene with a visceral energy many films today lack, which adds to the suspense of the film. The only real problem with Milestone's vision is its determination to treat the Japanese as something other than human--sneaky, arrogant, mechanical, mercenary, barbaric--calling to mind so much of the vicious anti-Japanese propaganda of World War Two (which the Germans and Italians--whose populations in the U.S. were significantly larger--seemed relatively spared of). It would be campy if not for the fact that such portrayals inspired generations of empty-headed movie-goers to think of Asians in general in such racist terms.

While the first couple of Terminator films were by no means great works of art, they'll seem like "Citizen Kane" compared to this unrelentingly tedious sequel. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as a "good" Terminator, once again sent into the past to stop an assassination by a "bad" Terminator (Aryan poster girl Kristanna Loken) that will change the future. Or will it? Never mind trying to make sense of what is going on on or why this film contradicts its predecessor, the plotting and dialogue are the stuff of 13-year-old imaginations, which is to say that lots of things happen but without the requisite character interactions to make you care anyway. Instead, there are plenty of explosions and shoot `em ups, orchestrated by director Jonathan Mostow without the energized, pornographic attention to detail that talented schlockmeisters like James Cameron can bring to bear. Nick Stahl, who looks so much like the lead in "Malcolm in the Middle" I expected him to break wind, is a better John Connor than the irritating Edward Furlong, but that isn't saying much. Once promising TV star Clare Danes vacillates between stupid and annoying in her portrayal of a veterinarian who is, well, stupid and annoying - in fairness to her, the script does give her such gems as "Oh, my god" and "Let me out of here!" for banter. Despite all the money spent on this film, it seems rather half-baked, and even the noisy climax in some relatively impressive sets will lull you into a stupor. One of the few redeeming qualities, though, is to watch Schwarzenegger obviously age from the slathered-in-makeup, perhaps digitally revised figure he is at the start of the film. Maybe they'd exhausted the budget for such niceties by the middle of filming. "Terminator 3" might please less discriminating viewers, but anyone looking for an edge-of-your-seat thriller would be advised to look elsewhere.

Not much to add to D. Dorton's excellent, informative review (see below). For stylishly Bondian tracks, listen to Blunt Instrument, I'm the Money, and, of course, The Name's Bond . . . James Bond. The soundtrack probably could have benefitted from more music like this, especially the bits in Blunt Instrument where Bond arrives in the Bahamas -- perhaps available elsewhere? Romantic tracks include the Barry-esque Solange, Vesper, and City of Lovers, which seems a pastiche of Barry's "Out of Africa" score. In between is mostly interesting, fast-paced "action" music, such as Miami International, though some of it is forgettable and derivative of Arnold's earlier work. The combination of The Bitch is Dead and the final track may give some fans shivers, as together they strike the right balance of tragedy and cool. The loss of Chris Cornell's title track is noticeable and an interesting gambit, I'm guessing, to increase his take, but the basic theme is interwoven into several of the tracks here, along with traces of the Bond theme.

I like Denzel Washington, have ever since his "St. Elsewhere" days, though I've never thought he radiated the all-time star quality so many people declare he does -- just stacked up against the mediocrity of contemporary acting and filmmaking, he shines. He's a likable presence, savvy and natural before the camera, but he's still no Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, or Sidney Poitier. Nonetheless, his performance in "The Mighty Quinn" as a smooth, mostly law-abiding Caribbean police chief investigating a gruesome murder deserves even more accolades than it typically gets. Despite a wandering accent (still not as bad as Kevin Costner's in "Robin Hood"), it ranks among his best and holds the film together, which is no mean feat considering the plot and execution are sometimes uneven. As with the best film noirs, the actual mystery in "The Mighty Quinn" takes a back seat to the exploration of Quinn's personal life, which in stereotypical fashion is in shambles in spite of and because of his bravado. His marriage is strained, his childhood friend (Robert Townshend) is the chief suspect in the murder, and his aspirations for political mobility are dashed. There's also a shabby American (M. Emmet Walsh) poking about, suggesting he may be something other than an eccentric tourist, and the wife of a bigwig (Mimi Rogers) putting out more sexual temptations than Quinn needs at this point in his life. When it all works -- and it frequently does -- "The Mighty Quinn" is eminently watchable, as breezy and rich with music and local color as a good vacation (the bits with characters in the police station are among the film's finer moments, as is a rendition of the titular song). When it doesn't, as with an incidental soundtrack that assumes we're too dumb to understand what's going on or with a climax that undercuts the smartness of the rest of the mystery, the film feels schizophrenic. There are some nice visual allusions, including three blind men walking the streets to music, a la "Dr. No," and one must wonder whether Walter Mosley was inspired by the book upon which this film was based. And despite its flaws, "The Mighty Quinn" stands up to repeat viewings, mostly because of Washington.

I was under the impression that TV comedy had died years ago and a half-wit warlock resurrected it, lumbering and Zombie-like, as ADHD crap like "Family Guy" and "Robot Chicken" or cookie-cutter detritus like "Two and half Men" and "How I Met Your Mother." You know, where you get the impression that the people making the show are laughing more than the people watching it . . . and the former is not really laughing all that much either. "Louie" is the zombie apocalypse survivor who makes it through the night, pushes open the storm cellar door, and emerges with a shotgun, justifiably ready to blow the heads off whatever is still dumb enough to be staggering around. It's written, directed, and headlined by Louis C.K., who looks more like the guy who rents you a U-Haul than a stand-up comedian, but that's perfect. He is the master of timing, especially the slow burn, generally playing straight man in a world that makes little sense and therefore is a lot like ours, flashing a lightning-fast wit just often enough to remind you, thank God, somebody else out there gets it. The show takes a page from "Seinfeld" -- and that's a supreme compliment -- in its jokes and set ups, commenting on the minutiae of daily life, relationships, self esteem, responsibility, and so forth, even though its aesthetic is more mopey than jokey. Think "Seinfeld" on Xanax and with much more pathos, "Curb Your Enthusiasm" without the smarm. Louis C.K. plays a modern everyman, a divorced 40-something trying to figure out just what the heck happened while a confusing world swirls around him with more intent than purpose. It has the guts to ask the questions people really have and to not always give them the answers they want, albeit with laughs. A standout episode, for instance, features the ever date-hungry Louie finally coaxing a woman out, then convincing her to stay out a little longer at a donut shop, only to have the night ruined by a group of dumbass teenagers who turn Louie's badly conceived effort to be the grown-up in the room into an exercise in emasculation. It's painful to watch, but it's the metaphor for Louie's life as a flawed man struggling to do what's right even when he isn't sure what that is. When his date takes the gesture as a personal humiliation for her -- she understands why Louie does it but nonetheless feels he's a loser and ends the date -- we're reminded of why Louie is the conscience-addled square peg in a world of narcissistic round a-holes. Believe it or not, there are some laughs in there, but how the episode resolves itself, especially when Louie follows one of the teenagers home and we're not sure what he or the punk's parents are going to do, is the essence of a good The New Yorker story. "Edgy" is an overused word, and almost always misapplied, but "Louie" is edgy in its authenticity and more like listening to real people tell you their problems while chuckling over a beer. The show has a Gen-Xer's sarcasm, but a better description would be say that it's "adult," so that when we see Louie struggle through an awkward first date or suffer the travails of modern air travel, it's less about the gags and more about the truth people face in their lives. Observations are grounded in reality rather than silliness, and that makes them all the more funny.

If you're a fan of the Coen Brothers, this off-kilter remake of a better, 50-year-old British comedy will more likely bring a tear to your eye than a chuckle to your lips. Everything that was so right about "Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?" is what is so wrong with "The Ladykillers"--acting, pacing, dialogue, characterization--even if both films use the same platform of comically inept criminals on the loose. Here, Tom Hanks proves once again why he is overrated as an actor, opting to turn his Professor Dorr into a strange amalgam of theatrical scenechewing and non-sequitur ticks and gestures rather than create someone of flesh and blood. It doesn't help that he's surrounded by, perhaps, the most forgettable cast ever in a Coen Brothers' film--even the stunningly dull "The Man Who Wasn't There" managed to bag actors of some depth and charisma. With the exception of Tzi Ma and, maybe, Pickles, the cat, everyone in "The Ladykillers" is either forgettable or downright annoying, especially Marlon Wayans, whose ghetto-ized, beanpole punk ranks among the worst offenders. Even fellow Ohio State alum J.K. Simmons and the often charming Irma P. Hall seem flat and lifeless--and I know they can turn in great performances. The shell of the 1955 version's story remains here, as a misfit gang plots to use an innocent, if self-righteous, boarding-house landlord's basement as the starting point for a subterranean robbery. When she catches on to their plot, things heat up, as the gang must decide what to do with her. That it takes four fifths of the film to get to what is, essentially, the major conflict is probably the biggest problem with "The Ladykillers" and by that time, I'd simply lost interest. Even a good, if underused, soundtrack and a couple of funny bits involving a donut shop robbery gone wrong and the Wayans character being chastized for his big mouth aren't enough to justify spending time with "The Ladykillers."

Gerry Anderson's "The Protectors" probably debuted a few years too late -- one of those sweeping shows of international intrigue, it has a 60s vibe that by the 1970s didn't get the full production it deserved. Robert Vaughn, himself an icon of the previous decade, stars as Harry Rule, ostensibly the American leader of a group of European guardian angels in the vein of Leslie Charteris' "The Saint." What makes "The Protectors" particularly interesting is its half-hour format, mandating that stories be wrapped up in far less time than an adventure series usually has. The results are mixed, though generally good and occasionally compelling. Certainly "Seinfeld" 25 years later showed it was possible to tell a compelling albeit humorous story in less than 30 minutes, and in the same way, most episodes of this series manage to cut out the filler that pads too many hour-long programs.While Vaughn's career would take a turn into frequent onscreen villainy, here he remains the smooth, intelligent hero, with less panache than his memorable Napoleon Solo but frequently given more opportunity to stretch his considerable acting talent. Tony Anholt's almost impossibly handsome sidekick, Paul Buchet, and the lovely Nyree Dawn Porter, perhaps the last thinking-man's babe, never show up Vaughn in a cast that is as good looking as it is talent. Location scenes, though, seem a little subdued, as the series was shot on 16 mm with the muted cinematography that became more common once the 60s was over. That aspect of the production is probably is least appealing, offset to some degree by a catchy theme song that became a lasting hit for the Tom-Jones-ish crooner Tony Christie.

We live in such an age of hype that I avoided this film for years, as I do any film that is so talked about, so pushed by the marketing people and the various toadies that help them that I'm must plain sick of it. But I really liked "Cold Mountain." Simple as that. Though the ending is predictably tragic, I found the performances captivating, the visuals engrossing, and the style riveting. Jude Law plays Inman (perhaps named for the lovable mincing fellow on "Are You Being Served?), a laconic carpenter who falls for Nicole Kidman's powdered and pale Ana, the sort of life-sized Barbie Doll with brains that really only exists in modern Hollywood movies. (But you gotta love Ms. Kidman's inhibitions about shedding her clothes any chance she gets.) That their burgeoning love is interrupted by the American Civil War is just one of the many obstacles confronting this pair of basically decent people about to be kicked in the head by life. The cast is quite solid, from Donald Sutherland's gentle preacher to Ray Winstone's thuggish homeguard marshal to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's charming turn as a scoundrel. But Renee Zellweger manages to screw her face up and play simple-minded for real as a tomboy who comes to help Ana in her times of woe -- I don't know if it was Oscar-worthy, but her performance for once didn't drive me away from the television. And the film doesn't shy away from showing either the loose morality of the times or the violent resolutions of the various powerplays (though one gets from this film the rather kooky sense that hardly anybody in the south was ever truly racist). If there is a flaw to the film, it's in the script's desperate need to stack the deck toward "important" by having a bittersweet ending; after all, despite the impressive production, the story is really the stuff of paperback romances and, perhaps, old, old legends, and surely it was enough to let things resolve themselves in the way the audience wanted.

"Cousin Bette" is one of those modern costume dramas where people muck about with British accents, (even the American actors--in France, no less!) that purport to make them civilized, yet behave more or less like animals rather than people. The Balzac novel on which the film is based managed to satirize much of "high" culture of the period-where privileged people behaved more or less like animals than civilized people--yet the film seems resigned to revel in the broad, soap-opera-ish plot of a woman wronged taking her revenge than anything else. (It's difficult to find subtlety in a film that finds excuses to repeatedly show Elizabeth Shue's naked, muscular backside.) The film features a who's who "B" list of capable actors--Shue, Bob Hoskins, Hugh Laurie, and others, though the real star of the movie is the production, which is better than the typical BBC production but not quite the best of Merchant/Ivory fare. The biggest flaw is the characterization of Bette. Lange brings Bette to life with a bit too much darkness--she often comes across more as a snake waiting to be provoked than a plain woman abused by the selfishness of the beautiful and wealthy--which undermines our sympathy for her. In the end, Bette gets her revenge, but she lowers herself to the level of villain to do it, making the film seem more a poor imitator of "Dangerous Liaisons" than anything else.

Hollywood likes to pretend the early 1980s -- when tight clothes, natural hair, and a laid back attitude were more common than throughout the rest of that narcissistic, self-indulgent decade -- never really existed. "Wet, Hot Summer" wants to remind us of the more interesting half of Reagan's era, parodying two genres, the raunchy teen comedy and the summer camp movie.In both cases, the film mostly works, managing to both evoke the look and feel of those films while also offering a nostalgic peek into the time period. This is one of the few films about the 1980s that actually gets the hair and clothing styles right, as well as the attitudes of teens and preteens. As breezy as the films it parodies, "Wet, Hot Summer" relies less on a rigid plot and more on a series of episodes featuring a slew of characters who hook up, break up, and repeat the pattern as necessary, all to a soundtrack that includes Rick Springfield, Foreigner, and Loverboy. Indeed, scenes often play out more like "Mad" magazine parodies, right down to funny non-sequiturs and layers of jokes that make for repeat viewings.The best storylines concern the awkward romance between the camp director (Jeaneane Garofalo) and a timid astronomer (David Hyde Pierce), though the ongoing soap opera involving a beefy jerk (Paul Rudd), his shallow admirer (Marguerite Moreau), and the sensitive goof who loves her (Michael Showalter) gets credit for being brutally honest. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns or sketch comedy vets, like the kooky but cute Amy Poehler and the kooky but unnerving Molly Shannon, but Christopher Meloni (who could play Bert if they ever film a version of "Sesame Street's" Bert and Ernie) gets to pull an Ed O'Neill as the unstable Viet Nam vet stereotype.The first half of the film stays more or less grounded (in fact, the opening credit sequence and first 15 minutes could have been lifted from an actual early 80s film); the second half takes the humor and story to far more exaggerated levels, involving, among other things, telekinesis and Skylab. Those of us who came through the decade will probably feel nostalgic, while younger generations will no doubt chuckle at the silliness of it all, if they aren't simply rolling their eyes. The ironic thing is that in making a spoof, director David Wain managed to capture many of the low-budget delights that made those films watchable, right down to the tight camera angles and the schmaltzy center. If it worked on you back then, it'll probably work on you now, too.

Brian DePalma is terribly underrated as a filmmaker--one might even legitimately use the term "auteur"--even if so many of his films seem derivative in style and content. Here, he mines a lot of Paul Verhoeven's work ("Basic Instinct," as well as Verhoeven's earlier European thrillers) and gives the production a "haute couture," late 1960s feel that is both breezy and dangerous. There's the requisite icy blonde (Rebecca-Romijn-Stamos, looking like the statuesque softball captain from high school who suddenly discovers expensive makeup) and a black-clad Antonio Banderas, playing the gigolo innocent pulled into the web of intrigue. The plot is fairly standard noir, though DePalma throws in a "what if" last act that is sure to disorient viewers unfamiliar with the director's penchant for split screens and narrative somersaults. The best thing about "Femme Fatale" is that despite showing a fair amount of sex, DePalma is more interested in exploring power as the defining force in our biology. Romijn-Stamos simply wields her body like a blunt instrument; for her, sex is power. By the second half, though, the convolutions of plot and familiar distractions of Romijn-Stamos in some state of undress grow repetitious. Nonetheless, the aesthetics of DePalma's artistic vision--from the confident camera angles to the perversion of Ravel's "Bolero" to the production's fondness for sea foam green--are worth giving this DVD a look. Given DePalma's sensibilities, I wouldn't mind seeing him some day breathe life back into the Bond films.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The best stuff on television and in film nowadays comes in animated form. How is it that the writers, directors, and actors of live-action productions can't seem to generate much that isn't a half-hearted imitation of better productions from years ago while those in animation seem to keep getting better and better? While it borrows heavily in atmosphere from James Bond and other 60s spy movies (as well as "The Return of the Jedi" and other sci-fi action flicks), "The Incredibles" is a rollicking good time in its own right . . . and is a better James Bond movie than any produced in the past 20 years. The idea of a family of superheroes isn't exactly new--and shows like "The Tick" have already lampooned the tribulations of superheroes in an everyday world--but "The Incredibles" pulsates with such energy and imagination that it's easy to overlook its faults. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are two actors I'd never have thought to pair up, but here they work amiably as a husband and wife team of semi-retired crimefighters struggling to raise a family while remaining incognito from a litigious world. When a new archenemy arises (who looks like the love child of Heat Miser and John Lithgow), they are pressed back into action, this time with the help of their kids. The computer animation in "The Incredibles" is solid, and the images and score manage to evoke Bonds like "You Only Live Twice" and "The Man with the Golden Gun," as well as productions like "Forbidden Planet," "Johnny Quest," and even the Walt Disney spaceflight shows. True, there is some surprising violence, and this is another vehicle aimed at children that seems to want to teach them that only white people and the occasional black sidekick (here Samuel L. Jackson instead of Eddie Murphy or Chris Tucker) exist in the world, but it's a fun ride. I do hope those responsible produce a sequel, if one with a bit more diversity.

Once in a while a movie sneaks up on me, delighting in ways that make up for its imperfections. "Impact" certainly qualifies, a sometimes quirky, sometimes remarkably effective little thriller that's one part Frank Capra and one part Howard Hawks. Pugnacious Brian Donlevy stars as Walt Williams, a blue collar lug whose hard work and sharp mind take him to the top of a manufacturing company. Unfortunately, his trophy wife (icy Helen Walker) unrepentantly schemes to have him killed by her oily lover (talented writer/actor Tony Barrett), only as the best laid plans often do . . . By the time he meets spunky good girl Marsha Peters (striking Ella Raines), he's bottomed out -- perhaps the best thing that ever could happen to decent guy like him. "Impact" explores the darkness of the human soul but unlike contemporary films, never falls victim to losing faith in the human condition. Without being preachy, it reminds us that monsters often come in pleasing forms and that trust should be neither easily earned nor quickly dismissed. While it suffers from a meager budget, director Arthur Lubin does a competent job, often filming on what looks like sets and locations left over from Hitchcock's "Vertigo." Watch the models in a mountainside car crash scene to see the attention to detail (hint: look at the driver's side of the car). Anna May Wong and Philip Ahn have to suffer through ricky-ticky caricatures of Chinese Americans common in the day, but the latter does get a great line that ironically challenges the stereotype. Charles Coburn does a good bit as an Irish-American flatfoot, and keen eyes will spot Jason Robards' dad as the judge in the inevitable court room scene.

After a lifetime of trying not to let religion get in the way of my relationship with God -- and being told by various people in various ways and, I hope, in the right spirit that their approach is superior -- perhaps it is a brush with the Divine that this book made it to me. For me, so far, the only meaningful relationship in this regard is a deeply personal one, and not one simply built upon a foundation of dogma, and though I've not been surprised, I have nonetheless often been hurt by how presumptuous so many people are about my faith or, for that matter, anyone else's but their own. I can't remember how I got "When Bad Things Happen to Good People," but it was on a dusty bookshelf and got my attention one day when I was not even in crisis. The good Rabbi's concept is not as radical as it seems: that God practices a degree of benevolent and sympathetic spectatorship when it comes to many happenings on Earth: war, poverty, disease, natural disasters. I've heard such claims before. Certainly, this resolves any number of spiritual conundrums when we experience the tragedies and unfairness of life. It reconciles the tolerance of the vast hypocrisy we witness in people who claim to be the most religious when behaving the most reprehensibly, or with the same ordinary failings of greed, sloth, deceit, vanity, jealousy, violence, and selfishness as everyone else. It smooths out the questions we have about why desperate prayers may seem to go unanswered. It is a rational approach to what may seem an irrational and often unsatisfying state of being, though it casts God with limitations that many people will find troubling if not preposterous. As other reviewers have pointed out, I don't know how satisfying the premise will be for many people (it wasn't much for me), but as an academic treatise, it provides food for thought and is written in a conversational style that is accessible. Rabbi Kushner's argument allows him to love God even while suffering the otherwise unbearable slow death of his son. For him, this understanding is cathartic; be warned that it may not be so for everyone, and it will certainly fly in the face of many people's belief system.

Though lacking the scope and real sense of tragedy of Billy Wilder's "The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1970)--another "what if Holmes fell in love?" film based on the characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle--hit-or-miss director Barry Levinson scores a hit with "Young Sherlock Holmes." Here, a teenaged Holmes (played convincingly by Nicholas Rowe) battles an arch nemesis, years before the realization of who that villain really is, all while meeting Watson (a very Harry Potter-esque Alan Cox) and falling in love for the first time with the delightful Elizabeth (Sophie Ward). The best parts of the film are watching the pre-adult Holmes developing his acute mental sensibilities, besting the local teen blowhard as well as the bumbling Inspector Lestrade in the fashion that only Holmes can; the worst parts are the campy moments of whimsy--the odd, gravity-defying flying machine--and the, perhaps, typical subtext that English culture must be under threat of erosion from foreign ideals. Still, the film moves at a good pace, even if it is at the expense of echoing other films, such as the Indiana Jones series, the aforementioned Wilder film, and the Rathbone/Bruce series.

You'd have to have a pretty hard heart not to enjoy "Framed," one of those whimsical, old-fashioned romances where an outsider comes through happenstance to a picturesque little town, only to find love he never knew he was missing. Trevor Eve is Quentin Lester, a stuffy sort despite his generally laid-back but upscale appearance (think TV's Frasier if he wasn't so often an ass) and who also happens to manage London's National Gallery. A convenient problem occurs requiring Lester to undertake a hare-brained plan to save priceless works of art and involves said small town and a network of forgotten caves. Of course it's really just the excuse to get Lester to meet Angharad Stannard (Eve Myles), a Bohemian, bookishly sexy schoolteacher, the sort of kind and genuine spirit one can't help but fall in love with. There is the requisite collection of harmless eccentrics and also a family, the Hughes, whose struggles are at times a bit cloying, though the youngest daughter, Minnie, is played with such kinetic alacrity that she makes up for it. I found myself rooting for Lester and Angharad -- the trouble with most romances is that I don't really care much for the people involved, but these two characters, as well as the actors playing them, are winningly sympathetic because they are such appealing people. And while some people may criticize the television production for being too "light," sometimes we need an antidote from the tribulations of real romance, where compromises and disappointments can take their toll. Here, true love rises above petty self interest, and that's not just entertaining, it's soul affirming. True love, it seems, does conquer all.

Englishman Abraham Stoker's Dracula is one of those novels whose film adaptations have been just that -- adaptations, sometimes only loosely based on their literary counterpart. When done well, they're often chilling, like the novel. When done poorly, they focus on elements for the most part only tertiary on the page. Certainly, Dracula is a gothic romance, but Francis Ford Coppola, for instance, somehow misinterpreted that to be almost entirely romance. This BBC version is among the best available, at once strange and frightening for the same reasons as the novel, whose brooding sense of inevitable tragedy keeps it one of the best horror stories of all time.Louis Jourdan correctly plays Dracula with the sort of patient wit one might just expect of an inhuman intelligence that had for hundreds of years skulked among us and that had seen enemies vanquished if not by him, by time. If Gary Oldman's Dracula walked a crooked line between glam rock star and aristocratic Bohemian, Jourdan's is instead a wonderfully consistent, dark perversion of the landed gentry, an ignobleman, if you will, a cunning and resourceful villain. That he is matched by Frank Finley's no-nonsense Van Helsing makes the escalating battle between them even more interesting. Both performances retain elements of classic villain and hero, respectively, but breathe dimension into characterizations that today would be far more boisterous (and blank faced but ridiculously young and buff) yet remain one-dimensional. In this version, you truly believe these characters are living beings and not types, thinking and responding to their environments and the obstacles that they are besting in ways that make sense emotionally and otherwise.The basic plot of the novel is here: Dracula wishes to relocate to England, hiring attorney Jonathan Harker (who will narrowly escape his ultimate fate from Dracula's brides) to find him the old manor home to start over. After delivery by shipwreck, Dracula claims victims, including Lucy, one daughter of Dr. Seward, administrator of the local sanitarium, who ultimately consults his friend, Van Helsing, while Dracula sets his sights on the other daughter, Mina. As with all versions, this one manipulates the plot - for instance, Lucy and Mina are not sisters in the book - but otherwise stays relatively true, right down to having Dracula's brides feast upon a baby.The performances throughout are extremely effective, the strongest quality of the film, with two additional standouts coming from the lovely Susan Penhaligon as the doomed Lucy (whose transformation is both ferocious and sexy) and Jack Shepherd as a crazed but not crazy Renfield.Director Phillip Saville chooses a minimalist approach to the camera work, still generally common even in the 1970s but particularly refreshing in this age of epileptic, ADHD filmmaking, letting the performances carry scenes and only occasionally relying on primitive optical effects. (He's to be given some latitude, too, for choosing what looks like a fruit bat to portray Dracula in other form; there is a noticeable resemblance to Jourdan's eyes and proportion of facial features.) Younger audiences likely will be disappointed with the slower pace and lack of glitzy imagery -- and may find the then common practice of switching between video and film jarring -- but anyone old enough to think wine should be sipped and not gulped or combined with Red Bull should find that the stylings make perfect sense. While there's no reason to avoid the previous incarnations of Dracula, from Bela Lugosi's groundbreaking turn to Christopher Lee's decades-long reign to Frank Langella's James Bondian suaveness, this version might just be the one you will want to see again and again.

If you want to sell softcore porn to a "sophisticated" audience, including button-down critics, what do you do? Why, class up the joint by sticking a bunch of stage actors in tuxedos and evening gowns and making them talk in those nasally, affected British accents, of course. Oh, and it'll help if you base the story on a true event and tell it in an ironic, tragic sort of way. That's about what "Scandal" does, though not with particular style or grist. Purporting to delve into the so-called Profumo Affair in the 1950s that led to mayhem for the British government, it's more about skin than politics, titillation than character. Joanne Whalley stars as a cat-faced party girl and professional homewrecker, not above any kink or good time with her crowd of over-the-hill frat boys (including Sir Ian McKellan, looking rather ridiculous with a partially shaved head, and a kooky John Hurt). She cruises the fast-track to success by bedding every London politico in sight until predictably, inevitably, things go wrong. It isn't that "Scandal" doesn't at times grab the viewer's attention; it's that it uses exactly the same T & A as the cheapest of cable TV softcore to do so. The stuff in between seems just a sham to add the faintest air of respectability to it all . . . just like the cheapest of cable TV softcore. Controversial when it was made in the late 1980s--(Gasp!) this white vixen even sleeps with black men!--the film's sexuality will seem somewhat quaint today. If you want to see reasonably attractive people get naked or pretend to have a threesome, then "Scandal" is for you. If you want something more, keep looking.

"National Treasure" isn't a bad movie. It's just one of those productions calculated to hit every predictable result in its target audience, as polished and hermetically sealed as the fabled treasure its characters seek. Nicholas Cage, who long ago entertained me somehow in "Valley Girl" and "Raising Arizona," turns in his requisite blank performance as Benjamin Franklin Gates, the last, we're told, of a family of well-to-do, toupeed kooks obsessed with finding the treasure of colonial Free Masons. Perhaps disturbingly, the women of the family are long gone, leaving first Christopher Plummer and then Jon Voight to impart wisdom in their off-kilter ways, though the love interest played by the Keira Knightly-ish (herself rather Winona Ryder-ish) Diana Kruger does her chilly best to keep the boys honest. When Gates is double-crossed by Bond wannabe Sean Bean, things get tense, first as the ex-partners each devise a robbery of the Declaration of Independence and later, when the film gets inspiration from the Indiana Jones series in what looks like the next attraction at Disney World. Director Jon Turteltaub keeps things moving at a brisk pace, helped by a percussive, familiar electronic score, which is good considering the story mostly consists of standard chases and a rundown of clues that seems right out of "Scooby Doo." The mystery itself is as convoluted as they come - you'll give up trying to keep track of things -- though the location shooting, especially in Philadelphia, manages to capture the majesty of America's wonderful historical locations. Supporting efforts from Harvey Keitel, as a tired FBI agent, are largely wasted, though a lot less of Justin Bartha, as the annoying computer nerd, would have been welcome. It really deserves three and a half stars, but four just wouldn't be accurate.

While I enjoy raunchy, unpretentious comedies as much as the next guy, I generally like them to be funny. And smart. "Team America: World Police" isn't much of either. Oh, there are a few bits I guffawed it, not limited to the infamous, graphic puppet sex scene, which lampoons, among other things, the MPAA's rather narrow-minded view that showing sex without genitals will somehow be less problematic than showing sex with. Kim Jong Il is a hoot, about the only aspect consistently amusing, though he's so much like Saddam Hussein in the much, much better "South Park: The Movie," right down to his demise, that it felt like I was viewing outtakes from the previous effort. And while the puppets are an interesting -- and cheap -- novelty, they're never really used in quite the same stylish fashion as the Gerry Anderson shows from the 60s they invoke. Ostensibly the plot of "Team America: World Police" concerns an elite if clueless group of WASPy heroes who save the world from terrorists . . . while generally destroying much of what they've come to save. The swipes at U.S. foreign policies that impose values rather than inspire them are here, but both liberals (in the form of Hollywood headline-mongers and armchair diplomats) and conservatives (as freedom-through-firepower types, echoed in the movie's absurdly jingoistic country music songs) take it on the chin. Yet for all the hoopla, this Parker/Stone vehicle never is all that clever. The humor is about what you'd expect from sixth-graders playing naughty with dolls, and the satire is too obvious to be biting. I'm sure the film is a hit around frat houses, but that's probably about it. If you want more -- and I hope you do -- you'll need to look elsewhere.

&quot;Kicked in the Head&quot; ain't brilliant, but it does unfold with an energy that is both youthful and honest, the way movies about young people should be. Kevin Corrigan's Redmond finds himself criss-crossing paths with gangsters, stalker girlfriends, and even a terrier tied to a shopping cart in his quest to find true love (in the guise of Linda Fiorentino as a smoky stewardess who's been around the airport a few times). Less ably plotted than heartfelt, the movie sometimes lets its hit-and-miss comedy get in the way of the better moments, like the confused Redmond's attempts at a Graduate-style reconciliation with what he thinks is the love of his life. Still, it's sincere in feeling, and any movie that can work the remake of Louis Armstrong's Bond song &quot;We Have All the Time in the World&quot; can't be bad. Check it out if you need to be reminded of the breezy angst of young love.

Disney's "The Black Hole" spelled the end of an era, as the studio's films moved finally from the more genuine, kid-friendly formula that had fueled its movies since the 1950s to the crass, plasticky and forgettable marketing-based fare that has dominated big studio films since the 1980s. In that respect, "The Black Hole" deserves a look simply for its historical value, but the film offers more. Though many viewers incorrectly compare it to "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" (somebody first made that comparison years ago, and now people seem determined to keep repeating the flawed opinion), the film has more in common with "Forbidden Planet" than anything else, as it tells the story of a deep space expedition's crew discovering a lost scientist's egocentric empire 20 years later. The once-dashing Maximillian Schell plays that villainous scientist, Dr. Hans Reinhart, with the brooding menace of Boris Karloff in his prime, while the underrated Robert Forster (so likable in cult films like "Alligator"), is the stand-up, if stiff, starship captain (think "Captain Kirk" without the humor and swagger). But as with so many sci-fi films of the 1970s and 1980s, the major attractions are the production design and special effects, and "The Black Hole" delivers on both fronts, with a pseudo-gothic look and feel that distinguish it from any other fantasy film (supported by John Barry's magnificent score). Still, even as a bridge between eras, "The Black Hole" ultimately compromises too much to succeed, as it lacks both the technobabble and self-importance that appeals to sci-fi nerds and the spirited action and shoot-em-up flair that pulls in the thinking-challenged, despite a few scenes of grim violence (and the lovely Yvette Mimieux, largely wasted as a psychic along to find her missing father). Worse, the DVD is pretty scarce, meaning finding a widescreen version to view may be more of an obstacle than escaping the clutches of Reinhart's robot army.

So I was late to the party again, which is to say I finally saw "Miami Vice" more than two years after it debuted. I do remember catching the trailer in the theater and liking in particular the Linkin Park song, "Numb," which played over the atmospheric visuals. Could this be another stunner from Michael Mann, whose films might best be labeled "adult contemporary," that, unbelievable as it sounds, in a good way? Well, then Jamie Foxx appeared on the screen . . . and then so did Colin Farrell, two actors who almost without fail inspire me to watch something without them in it. Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas may not have had Oscar-winning careers, but they were eminently more interesting than these two.Speaking of the original series, people nowadays -- especially those who never actually watched "Miami Vice" -- tend to remember it for the iconic and occasionally comic fashions, but the reality is that the show was much better produced than most at the time. Mann's demand for crisp visuals, movie-like camera setups, and use of popular music gave "Miami Vice" a cinematic quality that TV in the 80s, with the possible exception of a smattering of programs like St. Elsewhere and The Equalizer, simply did not have. In fact, the constant comparisons of the TV series to music videos in those days was as inaccurate then as comparing the TV series to the film is today.That is to say that essential characters and the slow, brooding way in which Mann presents them are about the only things the film has obviously in common with the original show. The bright pastels -- tampered with briefly in the original series -- are replaced with the darker tones of the post-Grunge world. If scenes were mostly sun-kissed in the original, they are mostly moon-punched in this one. In fact, one of the surprising things about the film "Miami Vice" is how little of the city we actually see, compared to the insides of dank nightclubs or the cockpits of cigarette boats roaring across a bay at sunset. This is a film that takes the term "criminal underworld" literally.If you watch "Miami Vice" for a story, you're likely to be disappointed. Despite some globetrotting changes of scenery, the plot is an uncomplicated crib of any number of TV episodes where Crockett and Tubbs, though less simpatico this time around, team up undercover to foil a smarmy, deadly drug kingpin with a Latin name and nouveau riche lifestyle. Creepy-looking thugs help him out, just as more pleasant people are allies to our heroes. There's dialogue, some of it quite effective, some of it quite flowery, some of it mumbled by Farrell in ways that make it incomprehensible, but all of this is really secondary to the aural and visual craft that Mann brings to the screen. He's always been expert at scenes where characters don't say anything at all, where emotions roil to the surface through a look or their stoicism in the moment, and here Mann is in top form. Best of all, the two strongest action scenes -- a rescue scene and the film's climax -- are as good as anything he's ever filmed, perhaps better. And once again, Mann knows how to punctuate a scene with pop music that you would nonetheless assume must have been written precisely for that scene.In most ways, "Miami Vice" is more of a drama than an action film, and that is sure to disappoint audiences looking for more shoot 'em ups than this film wants or ever really promises to deliver -- its sensibility might best be compared to "To Live and Die in LA." Some viewers might also be distracted by Farrell's need for a haircut and shower or Foxx's desperate quest to find another expression besides moderately annoyed. And Jan Hammer's original theme is nowhere to be found. But I wouldn't mind seeing a follow-up, remote as that possibility is.

Terrence Malick's revision of "The Thin Red Line" is in many ways a better movie about war than its contemporary, "Saving Private Ryan." But that's because the latter only wants to be a war movie rather than a movie about war. Malick's often languid, sometimes obtuse take on the battle for Guadalcanal is far more introspective than the more traditional vision of combat, albeit with grim violence, offered by Spielberg, and in that sense, it's the more risk-taking of the two. The risks generally pay off, as audiences witness combat from introverts' perspectives, thanks in large part to Hans Zimmer's ethereal score and Malick's willingness to let most scenes simmer rather than boil. When action erupts -- as in the massacre of a Japanese camp -- it is often bookended by glimpses into the uncertainty of the men whose only reason for existence is to prepare to kill or be killed. (Malick seems to borrow such esoteric observations as an insect crawling on a leaf as bombs rain down on terrified soldiers from a lot of Asian films.) Still, Malick's successes are marred by some obvious flaws -- too many cameos by actors whose presence doesn't match the gravitas of the situation, leads who look so much alike as to be confusing, and a failure to address the racial dynamics of the situation, as though there never were any. Gripping scenes like an American waiting for a Japanese to die so he can extract fillings are contrasted with those that are handled almost as camp, such as when a sergeant blows himself up with his own grenade. In the end, there aren't many answers offered by "The Thin Red Line," though the possibility of answers is ever present, making Malick's vision both enduring and frustrating.

If you like the one about the whales, you'll probably enjoy "Star Trek: Insurrection," too. Unlike its successor, the bloated and ill-conceived "Star Trek: Nemesis," this third foray into theaters for the "TNG" crew is a competent, if not particularly riveting, adventure that often feels more like an old-fashioned Disney film than anything else. That's actually the best thing going for it, as Captain Picard and crew discover an intergalactic Shangri-La that is the focal point for a generational civil war. Comfortable as director, co-star Jonathan Frakes does what he can with a script that is frequently sweet (and sometimes needlessly violent) but like many of the modern Trek episodes, short on plot and long on technobabble. He had more success with the last film, which managed to evoke the spirit of Captain Kirk's era, but Frakes here still finds new ways to show us things we've seen a million times before, no mean feat. He's aided by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith's evocative score, which is present almost as much as the film's key players, some beautiful special effects, and good turns by guest stars Anthony Zerbe and F. Murray Abraham. Over the years, I suspect, this one will become more endearing to fans, who may better appreciate the film's gentler themes and personality with age, even if moments of pure corn--like breast jokes and Data's singing--still elicit well-deserved groans.

"Starship Troopers" is a rarity -- a big budget Hollywood film that manages to lampoon just about everything Hollywood cranked out in the 80s and 90s. Based loosely on the seminal book by Robert Heinlein, the film takes numerous and generally on-target shots at space opera, European imperialism, and empty-headed jingoism, negating much of what the book propped up. Sometimes it cuts too close to the bone, one of the reasons it wasn't popular at the box office, but the film also functions reasonably well as an action adventure, despite questionable science and military tactics. Think of it as the anti-"Star Trek," existing in an alternate fantasy universe where Europeans still dominate despite being a minority on Earth, but the Nazis won WWII and designed our future. The cast is of the same blandly attractive ilk that populates dreck like "Beverly Hills 90210" and "The OC," right down to the fair hair, Pepsodent smiles and cheesy acting, and that's just fine for a story that pokes fun at American popular culture. (Denise Richards' punched-in-the-mouth-and-caught-in-the-headlights look is devastatingly perfect for comedic effect, but Casper Van Dien actually does a respectable job as the jock hero.) Director Paul Verhoeven repeats some of his "Robocop" schtick with slightly less success this time but manages to evoke genuine emotions in the often tragedy-laced action scenes (the two best being a "Beau Geste" stand at an overrun fort and the destruction of a space fleet close to the film's climax). Underrated composer Basil Poledoris provides a terrific score, and an abandon-ship sequence featuring dead bodies thunking spaceship hulls was repeated with far less pizzazz in the most recent "Star Wars" incarnation. And what to make of the violence? "Saving Private Ryan" offered as much and was less cartoonish, yet reaped rewards. Taken as satire, "Starship Troopers" is a savvy film; taken seriously, it's no worse than any of the other futuristic shoot-em-ups that litter the box office. And at least this one doesn't have Will Smith in it.

While choosing to reinvent, as opposed to reiterate, elements of previous "Hound" adaptations and the novel upon which they are based, this spritely television version of the familiar story maintains the essence of Conan Doyle's works while giving them a badly needed boost of cool. Here, Holmes is less the twitchy, sunken-eyed manic-depressive of the Jeremy Brett era, but more the confident Victorian adventurer (though not as suave or wonderfully controlled as in the Rathbone era). And while Richard Roxburgh may ruffle a few feathers as Holmes--he is a bit too fair-haired and frat boy for the part--he also brings a sense of joy to Holmes that hasn't been seen in a while. The plot is loosely based on the novel, in that a ghostly hound appears to be the engine to fulfill a deadly curse on the Baskerville family. Several liberties, though, are taken with the general story, including making Watson, as played by Ian Hart, a harder-edged character than we've seen before and presenting Holmes' infamous drug use as a bourgoise form of recreation rather than a tonic for intellectual stagnation. Still, David Attwood's fluid direction and a nice musical score push this production above the standard humdrum television fare--especially the tepid stuff generally produced in the U.S.

The eminently watchable "Operation Crossbow" will remind you of other World War II caper films-"The Guns of Navarone" being the most obvious (helped, in part, by the presence of Anthony Quayle, though a bad guy this time). And while that film does the trick better, "Operation Crossbow" is no slouch, featuring impressive production values and a solid cast of familiar faces that includes Jeremy Kemp, Richard Johnson, and Trevor Howard. George Peppard leads a spy team posing as engineers, whose job is to gather intelligence on the burgeoning Nazi rocket program. Along the way, they face several close calls, including running into the wife of one of the dead men that provides their cover (the luscious Sophia Loren in what amounts to barely more than a tragic cameo). Director Michael Anderson chooses a documentary approach to the first third of the film, showing both the Nazi scientists developing their rockets and the British Intelligence agents trying to uncover it. But once the team is dropped into enemy territory, the film shifts into a more traditional narrative mode, including Ron Goodwin's bombastic score and the inevitable countdown to avert disaster. What is most striking about "Operation Crossbow" is its lack of moral judgment-both the Allies and the Axis are shown to be capable of great compassion and great villainy, their methodology no different in their common goal of winning the war. And though we are expected to root for the Allies, the hard-edged manner in which the team executes its plan sometimes gives us pause, making "Operation Crossbow," perhaps, disconcerting for someone expecting a standard "good guys versus bad guys" film. Nonetheless, despite some slow moments-getting to the German lair seems to take a long time-its worth viewing, both as an action film and as a commentary on the nature of war.

As wartime propaganda, &quot;Bataan&quot; is brilliant--watching it, you may be filled with a seething hostility toward the Japanese that hasn't been felt since Reagan's 1980s. But what's more remarkable is that this gritty, often racist Robert Taylor vehicle is pretty solid as a movie, too. Filmed on an atmospheric soundstage that doubles for the jungle, its moody production practically oozes menace and rivals the Universal &quot;monster movies&quot; of the 1930s. (Watch it at night with the lights off for the full effect.) Often dubbed a remake of John Ford's &quot;The Lost Patrol,&quot; &quot;Bataan&quot; has as much in common with any number of last-stand movies . . . as well as later slashfests like &quot;Friday, the 13th,&quot; where each character's inevitable demise is more gruesome than the last. In that respect, &quot;Bataan&quot; is again remarkable, as the violence is graphic and shocking, particularly for the period in which the film was made. The cast of many familiar faces, including Desi Arnez, Barry Nelson, Lloyd Nolan, and Robert Walker, also deliver the emotional goods, keeping us caring about what happens next to these doomed men, a quality more recent films generally lack. If you're expecting the technoglitz excess of &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; you'll probably be disappointed by &quot;Bataan.&quot; But if you want to see a Hollywood depiction of war as a silvery nightmare, this may well be the one movie to watch.

People forget that "Columbo" started out not as a 1970s TV series, but as a single TV movie in 1968 that pitted an arrogant genius against a streetwise bulldog of a detective. Falk is wonderful as a criminal's worst nightmare-a rumpled little man who disarms his opponents with his cheap suits and scatterbrained demeanor. In "Prescription: Murder," Columbo is considerably more polished-and aggressive-than in the TV series in his attempt to take down a psychiatrist (played regally by the always-polished Gene Barry) who's murdered his wife in what he thinks is the perfect crime. The production is sumptuous for television fare, with sets and color that rival cinema productions of the time, and even if all of the Columbo telefilms essentially copy Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder," the story is quite satisfying. As was standard for the time, the best part of "Prescription: Murder" is watching two great actors spar with each other in a plot that is more chessmatch than car chase. They just don't make them like this anymore.

Before I reveal what I think of Erin Belieu's poetry, a confession: We were classmates once. It was in graduate school, where our interactions were so infrequent, they barely qualified us to identify each other in a police lineup. So understand that I have no incentive beyond the quality of her work to either praise or condemn it. That said, Erin's poetry is stunning. I'll throw out more clich&eacute;s -- raw, bold, witty, honest, haunting, powerful, dynamic, illuminating. It's so good that if Milton Berle were a poet and alive, he would steal it. I generally avoid poetry the way I do needles and babies, but Erin's work is just that impressive. It's a fairly safe bet that many more readers will discover her, but now's your chance to get ahead of the curve, to be able to say, like me, "I knew her when . . ." I suspect you won't be disappointed.

"Quantum of Solace" is the first Bond film in the past 25 years that I did not see more than once in the theater. Ironically, it's not because it's a significantly worse film than the ones that preceded it; in fact, compared to most, it's much better. Daniel Craig turns in another strong performance as Bond, obviously older and a little more self-assured this time than in the superior "Casino Royale," even if the film producers keep foolishly trying to find ways to make us think of him more as Steve McQueen than Sean Connery. (This time it's a sequence involving, of course, a motorcycle.)Part of the challenge was scheduling, I suppose -- finding the time and then finding it again in the theater. But another, more troubling reality is that the film, as good as it is, is simply not inviting of a second look. That's paradoxical since Marc Forster's bizarre choice to give it an irritating, hyperactive sensibility almost demands a second or third look just to tell what the heck is going on. Forster seems ignorant of the fact that one of the joys of watching a Bond film is taking in the production, everything from the clothes to the cars to the sets -- here, you barely get a look at anything before there's another quick, often visually disjointed cut that will make some viewers physically ill.Bond is back in what is probably the first true sequel of the film series, going after the shadowy organization -- now christened Quantum -- responsible for his travails in the previous movie. A handful of that film's cast, including crocodile-ish Jesper Christensen and charming Giancarlo Giannini, return, but are given less meaty and therefore meaningful roles than before. Christensen comes off less menacing and more wheezy, while poor Giannini suffers a fate that is ultimately just in poor taste and, worse, does little to advance the story. (The clumsy dialogue also muddies whether he was or wasn't a double agent.) The Bond girls are beautiful, and likable, though neither has as much impact as Eva Green because their roles aren't written that way, and a few nods to previous Bond films seem more gimmicky than anything else. Creepy Mathieu Amalric spends most of his time only promising villainy, though Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench once again prove they are the best Felix Leiter and M, respectively, in decades.The plot, like the one in "Casino Royale," is correctly grounded in reality, but the story is flimsier, with so much of what happens to Bond externalized, despite his quest for vengeance. Perhaps Forster shouldn't have been so determined to make a Bond film barely more than 90 minutes long -- slower cuts and more story would elevate this film to the status it deserves. A bright point, though, is David Arnold's score, perhaps his most mature to date. Overall, though, even some Bond fans, like me, will be challenged to get into the spirit to watch "Quantum of Solace" again; right now, it feels like a meal at a fine restaurant you don't get to savor because someone has reservations for your table in half an hour. Eating there again under the same conditions doesn't quite seem fun.My guess is the next Bond film will return to more fantasy-driven spectacle, a la "Goldfinger," and we might, indeed, be ready for that sort of Bond film again. However, I'd implore the producers to choose a director who understands the source material better and to not shy from a story letting Daniel Craig, the toughest Bond since Connery, outshine the gadgets and lame jokes that inevitably will follow. Going back to an autopilot formula would be a mistake considering the talent the cast can bring to the screen.

There are times when I think I'm the only person in America who wasn't abused by his parents; my students frequently write about such things, books on such matters top the bestseller lists, and Hollywood in the late 80s and early 90s helped reinforce this belief, as a spate of films about child or domestic abuse flooded theaters. Of course, perhaps because the families invariably were white (though obviously intended to represent some "universal" human experience), my more diverse family was spared this sort of insanity. I don't know. I do know that there are some things I don't care to see on film or otherwise, abuse of children (and animals) being among them. Still, I gave "Radio Flyer" a chance, in part because it was directed by the underrated Richard Donner. Overall, I found the film well-conceived, with a relationship between the brothers that was both warm and convincing. Much is made of Elijah Wood, who seems to overact in a few scenes; his co-star, Joseph Mazzello, is far sturdier as the younger brother, Bobby, as is Tom Hanks, voicing the adult version of Wood's Mike. Lorraine Bracco plays the typical featherbrained mother who is both largely ignorant of her children's suffering and divided in her loyalties to them and the psychotic meathead (Adam Baldwin) that gets drunk and knocks them around. And what to make of the ending? I understand there is debate about how literally it should be taken, as well as whether one of the brothers is real or a literary construct; I won't spoil it, but will say that in some ways, the ending may seem both obvious and a copout to anyone who has read more than three issues of "The New Yorker." And though I wouldn't recommend the film for children--its Disney moments are contrasted with a few more appropriate for Scorsese--I will say it made the subject matter palatable.

Usually with a TV series, the strategy is to hook the audience early, get enough episodes for syndication, and then worry less about quality, producing episodes that are just good enough to stay on the air and ensure video and DVD sales. "Star Trek: Enterprise" could be a case study in doing the opposite. The uneven, mostly disappointing first three seasons of the show felt like a retread of earlier "Star Treks" and other sci-fi, and there appeared to be an assumption that audiences would simply stick with the show out of Pavlovian habit. Fans will watch anything with "Star Trek" attached to it, right? When ratings plunged and budgets got slashed, the best thing that could happen to "Star Trek: Enterprise" occurred -- producer Manny Coto arrived to salvage things. The fourth season is clearly its best, with the show for the first time beginning to feel like a prequel that didn't rudely skip over the series that started everything. Had this season been the first, "Star Trek: Enterprise" might still be on the air; as things stand, "Star Trek: Enterprise" was cancelled just as it finally showed potential, the accumulated damage to its reputation from previous seasons too much to draw audiences back. Scott Bakula, visibly older and looking at times not unlike Joe Camel, nonetheless finally musters some of the appeal he had on "Quantum Leap" in episodes that give him more to do than get beaten or bark at people for no reason. Even the often appealing but ultimately go-nowhere romance between T'Pol and Tucker found its way into an excellent story with the series' penultimate episode. Unfortunately, even eye-catching apples can have worms, and two episodes stand out as inexcusably awful: "Daedulus" and "These are the Voyages." In fact, the final episode feels like the punch line to an otherwise funny joke. While "Star Trek: Enterprise" had high quality special effects and great potential, it will probably -- and with justification -- be remembered as the series that killed the franchise . . . at least until the franchise inevitably gets resurrected. The generally lowbrow stories and paint-by-numbers approach to telling them are what sent the series to the bottom of the ratings, not an oversupply of "Star Trek" on TV. When "Star Trek" shows some smarts again, people who read more than the funnies and sports page and can chew with their mouth closed will return -- in droves.

The academic world has been largely dismissive of the paranormal, and in particular the so-called hard sciences has -- you're more likely to find folklorists investigating it than physicists. That seems odd since phenomena that would have been considered quite miraculous 500 years ago have been easily investigated and understood by science today. The bias against the paranormal seems born more of emotions than rationality, or perhaps, the practical rather than the impractical. After all, the paranormal doesn't seem to conform to the tenets of conventional science, which would make it tough for conventional scientists to investigate it, which in turn would make it tough to get grants. "Red Lights" starts out sensibly enough, pitting a skeptical psychologist, Matheson (Sigourney Weaver), against myriad charlatans, the most problematic of which seems to be a Uri Geller-like celebrity ESPer called Silver (Robert DeNiro). The script stays within the bounds of reality right up until the part where her assistant, Buckley (Cillian Murphy), becomes obsessed with Silver, who he suspects may have had murderous intentions toward Matheson. At this point, Buckley's histrionics change the tone of the film, and it launches into the sort of absurdity about the academic world that filmmakers never can resist -- Buckley, now the department head, threatening and physically assaulting a colleague (poor Toby Jones) in front of peers and students, for instance. Yawn. Scholars, even the crummy ones, work in an intellectual world, where the fireworks come from the interplay of thinking and not from violence, yet movies treat them as sophomoric jugheads. You'll see the ending coming long before it gets unleashed, especially if you listen even casually to a line Buckley says early in the film. Had what preceded the ending been better, it could have been satisfying. But as things stand, "Red Lights" is too thin and can't decide if it wants to be a drama or a thriller, like an awkward short story with an otherwise interesting premise in an advanced creative writing class. Director Rodrigo Cortes manages to give the film a reasonably professional if low-budget quality -- think Darren Aronovsky with a digital camera -- and with a better script than the one he fashioned, should be able to make a better film in the future.

As soon as I saw that Ralph Fiennes' head was too small for his bowler, I knew "The Avengers" was going to be a mess. Terribly miscast as superspy John Steed--Fiennes is charmless in the role that Patrick MacNee so ably brought to life on television--he resembles a child wearing his father's hat (and not too happy about it). Uma Thurman fares little better. While she was terrific in both "Kill Bill" films, she's way out of her league looks-wise and charisma-wise when compared to Diana Rigg's simply scrumptious Emma Peel. And then there's the story, or what passes for it, something about a scene-chewing though not particularly convincing Sean Connery controlling the world's weather. Director Jeremiah Chechik and whoever is willing to take the blame for the script get some of the surface details of "The Avengers" formula right but completely miss the boat with regard to the TV series' wit, style, and sophistication, another (typical) modern misstep of focusing on form and ignoring substance. To be fair, a lot apparently was cut from the film before its release, but it's hard to imagine anything salvaging "The Avengers"--and the DVD is sans deleted scenes, so the point is moot. Eddie Izzard pops up looking like a mod, shrunken Oliver Reed but gets the film's best line, though a brief sight gag featuring "Mother," the spy agency boss, also actually made me chuckle with the film and not at it. At least poor Patrick MacNee was smart enough to make sure his cameo did not require him to actually show up on screen; Diana Rigg was smarter for turning the film down outright. Why anyone bothered to remake "The Avengers" is beyond me, as the show worked fine as it was, and I can't think of any actors today who could embody Steed and Peel as well as the originals.

A.I. is one of those movies that makes you wonder who is making the decisions in Hollywood. After all, just imagine the pitch: &quot;Give me a hundred million dollars to remake Disney's Pinocchio as an emotionally hollow, live-action nightmare that offers lots of high-minded questions about existence but no tangible answers.&quot; Noteworthy mostly because of the collaboration between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg, the movie struggles on nearly all levels except the most blandly technical, though even the production design looks recycled, a strange combination of Blade Runner and Batman and Robin, with a dash of Spielberg's standard Coca Cola/McDonalds/The Gap sensibilities thrown in. The story is more or less Pinocchio, except the wooden boy is mechanical and the adventure is just plain depressing. The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osmont rehashes his performance from that film, this time as a robot, David, starved for his rather unappealing adoptive mother's affection while questing to understand the meaning of life. You want to like this film because of the immediacy of its characters' pathos, but even with sincere performances from Osmont and Jude Law (and a robot teddy bear that, ironically, is more interesting than either of their characters), Spielberg never manages to harness anything meaningful or uplifting in what is essentially a bloated fairy tale. The finality of the film's conclusion is particularly cynical. One might argue nihilism is the point of A.I., but then one must ask the more important question: why bother? I'd also invite Spielberg to get out more--his constant film reiterations of the U.S., present and projected future, as a for-whites-only nation dotted by the occasional racial minority is neither accurate nor particularly endearing. Even the irony of a scene that mocks six-pack America's obsession with professional wrestling and demolition derby (and a large portion of the audience for his movies) is lost in a film that rather spookily suggests about a quarter of our population will all but disappear. In many ways, that's a more interesting conflict to resolve than anything in this movie.

"Whale Rider" is the sort of touching, beautiful film that seldom gets made anymore--at least not in the United States. Apart from expert, hands-off direction by Niki Caro and a richly authentic performance by lead Keisha Castle-Hughes, this gem from New Zealand has the courage to present complex characters in a situation that is universally appealing. The birth of Pai (Castle-Hughes) should be a cause for celebration, but her grandfather (Rawiri Paratene, in a marvellous performance) is torn between his love for the girl and his fear and disappointment that she was not born a he. What follows is a multi-generational struggle between tradition and familial bonds, as Pai sets out to prove to her grandfather that she is the fated "whale rider" that will succeed him as tribal leader. The great thing about "Whale Rider" is that the conflicts are immediately recognizable, with no real violence and even though no one in the film is truly a villain. With warmth, humor, and some genuine tears, the film explores the themes of duty, change, sacrifice, partriarchy, and, in the end, love--all in so natural a way that the film seems less art and more real life. Not bad. Not bad at all.

The first season of "Mission: Impossible" is easily its best -- the episodes were filmed in a creative but economic style, the scripts tightly written, the pacing wonderfully tense, the mood suitably low key, and the acting first rate. Under the command of Dan Briggs (cerebral Steven Hill), the IMF team went head to head each week with a villain entirely plausible, then and now. In fact, some plots could be ripped from today's headlines, as the team took down everyone from heroin czars to petty dictators to fanatical terrorists to local mafioso. During the first season, before the likable but lightweight Peter Graves would inexplicably replace Hill's tough-as-nails mission leader, the show easily stood out as high quality, even with great shows like "The Man from UNCLE," "The Wild, Wild West," "Secret Agent," and "The Avengers" in the mix. ("I Spy" comes closest in feel to the early "Mission: Impossible," and was nearly as unique in helping to redefine expectations for the genre.) The first season also made the best use of the ensemble cast, who all look great, allowing in particular the spectacular husband-and-wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain to shine without overshadowing Hill, Peter Lupus, or Greg Morris. By the second season, the show would start to give way to more conventional plots and characters, succumbing, too, to the gimmicky camera work most associated with the late 1960s -- the shaky hand held, the dark, soft focus, and the dreaded quick zoom. Among the guest stars this season are Lloyd Bridges, Simon Oakland, Eartha Kitt, Joseph Campanella, John Collicos, Fritz Weaver, Arthur Hill, George Takei, Albert Dekker, Jill Gordon, and Percy Rodriguez.

Gotta hand it to the Brits -- they can usually take even a premise as dopey and overdone as this one and make it work through a combination of style and earnestness of execution. No copping out, "good enough for those boobs in the audience" sensibilities at work here. Bravo. When people I respect started asking me if I'd seen this film, I knew it had to be special, but finding it was tougher than I thought. That's a pity because "Shaun of the Dead" eclipses so many slacker comedies on both sides of the Atlantic by uniting both a watchable cast and a wacky visual style that more people should see it. The story? A likeable loser finds himself battling the undead. That's it. There's some trifling about his mother and girlfriend, but it's mostly just an excuse to have Shaun -- who looks like a baby-faced version of Steve Buscemi -- to get out of his apartment. The frenetic comedy works quite well in the first half of the film, as we come to understand the irony that while Shaun technically is alive, he exists in a kind of living dead state due to his inability to take charge of his life. Holding him back are his ne-er-do-well childhood pal, Ed (Nick Frost), and his quandary over his on-again, off-again romance with spunky Liz (Kate Ashfield). Toss in an overbearing stepdad, a gaggle of smartass, teenaged employees, and an over-the-hill Harry Potter lookalike (Dylan Moran), and the result is a winning combination of satire and scares, even if the second half takes itself just a little too seriously as an actual zombie movie. And, of course, the ending ties things rather neatly up, but what else would you expect?

I remember seeing "The Glory Guys" on TV on a Saturday afternoon or two as a child; as something of a student of the era -- I was the kid who read the Time-Life books on the Old West and made a diorama of Custer's Last Stand for a school project -- I thought the film better than some, presenting images that rather faithfully reproduced what I'd seen in those pages, mostly the incredible paintings of Remington and Shreyvogel. But I also remember being somewhat bored by it, turned off by Tom Tryon's and Harve Presnell's wooden acting and a story that seemed to be taking quite a while to get to the inevitable battle. Watching it again 20 years later, and seeing it in widescreen, makes me appreciate the film more, though it isn't a perfect movie by any stretch. A fictionalized but thinly veiled accounting of the events leading up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the Sam Peckinpah-penned horse opera works best when it focuses on the mundaneities of a soldier's life in the era, as well as the desire to stay alive more than to ride into glory through a desperate, romanticized charge. These moments -- including the fresh recruits being turned into soldiers under the fatherly tutelege of a sargeant (Slim Pickens -- how can you go wrong with him in this role?), a boisterous night on the town, and a young private's sneaking off base to meet with a girl he loves -- position "The Glory Guys" as a better film about the military than most. But the so-so romantic triangle between Tryon, Presnell, and the lovely Senta Berger vacillates between being charming in a funny way (a fight scene with some good visual gags) and just plain tedious, as no one seems to have any sparks or interest in the other. Tryon tries, but he's better when giving orders; his cypher-like expressions and low tones actually give the generally excellent military moments a documentary feel, blunted a bit by an over-the-top presentation of a by-the-book lieutenant and by the underused Andrew Duggan, who seems too uncolorful when compared to the historical figure he stands in for. Presnell, who looks a bit like a poor man's Jimmy Stewart, is best when he's sardonic, such as his quip when meeting up with the retreating company at a river in the film's climax. The actual battle itself is interesting; without giving too much away, I'd say the film took a risk in its presentation, and it mostly pays off because the shock value reveals more than a conventional telling would or perhaps even could. "The Glory Guys" is a good film, great in many ways, but not quite as successful in what it attempts as, say, "Zulu," which feels like a cousin in spirit but ultimately is more dimensional in both character and sweep.

Despite all the buzz in those days, the 80s were not a particularly great time for TV. For every "St. Elsewhere," "Hill Street Blues," or "LA Law," there was a "Manimal, "Beverly Hills Buntz," or "Full House." If the 70s was mostly fluff like "Charlie's Angels," the 80s was that same fluff with a bloated budget and on coke.Not "The Equalizer." Hard hitting and generally uncompromising in its approach -- in the pilot, hero Robert McCall promises a stalker in no uncertain terms he will kill him if the stalker does not leave his client alone -- it was an atmospheric, effective series about a conscience-addled spy trying to do right after a lifetime of dirty deeds. Britain's own Callan, Edward Woodward, is the embodiment of McCall, a flawed hero that is one part anger, one part class, and one part mercenary, but all guardian angel, only with his halo tarnished and very, very heavy.The first season is the best, when Woodward, before suffering a heart attack, was a coiled, gray-haired avenger, capable of holding his own during the inevitable chase and fight scenes, despite having Michael Caine's gait, glasses, and accent. Where Woodward shines, however, is in any scene involving emotions, bursting and otherwise, and to watch his McCall explode into anger one moment but be reduced to absolute subtlety the next is to see an actor in his element. Indeed, though the scripts were often first-rate, Woodward could imbue them with more than the words themselves probably merited, which isn't to say that not unlike William Shatner, he didn't sometimes find himself being more theatrical than necessary."The Equalizer" was also shot mostly on location, with a cinematic camera style and muted cinematography that made New York even in summertime look as yellow and gritty as Normandy Beach would a decade later in Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan." Kudos especially to Richard Compton for the terrific directing. Stand out episodes include my personal favorite, China Rain, Lady Cop, Lock Box, Bump and Run, Reign of Terror, Desperately, Distant Fire, and Dead Drop (particularly the final scene with Saul Rubinek, the Yuppie boss putting the screws to McCall's friend, Control), but all are winners. The supporting cast, including Robert Lansing, Keith Szarabajka, Mark Margolis, and William Zabka, as McCall's estranged son, are great, and look for a host of notable guest stars -- I won't spoil it for you because you'll probably be amazed at how this show attracted top talent.Stewart Copeland's score, which combines a drummy, electronic underpinning with an almost delightful Irish-sounding ditty that is The Equalizer's theme, is used to maximum effect, both in the suitably menacing credits sequence and as incidental music throughout the series. (The aforementioned China Rain makes maximum use of it during the climax.) And, finally, McCall had the best trappings -- clothes, apartment, and car, a sleek, black Jaguar with a mobile phone. In the decade before even five-year-olds had flip phones, that alone was a pretty good setup.

Gerry Anderson's first live-action adventure remains a unique television effort worth at least one viewing by sci-fi buffs. For starters, "UFO" features the funky groove, jazzy music, and moody themes that signified the waning days of the 1960s (even if the show is set in the "distant" future of the 1980s). Beyond that, it's got some of the coolest toys of any show of the period--not very realistic, of course, but certainly enough to get the 12-year-olds in all of us salivating. Predicting the X-Files (but aping the Quatermass films and others of the genre), the show presupposes that Earth is already under attack by alien forces, and it's up to a supersecret government agency (under the guise of a movie studio--brilliant!) to foil the invasion. Ed Bishop plays Commander Straker, the cerebral leader of SHADO, with exactly the correct grounding to make purple-haired moonmaidens, a jet-firing submarine, and wobbly flying saucers believable. What's more, many episodes have a truly creepy edge, especially when we get glimpses of the humanoid aliens, here to steal our organs! Anderson would have slightly more success with this show's sequel, "Space: 1999," but never with the same combination of sheer imagination and atmosphere, even if many of the elements will seem campy to contemporary viewers.

If in season one "Star Trek: Enterprise" lurched to its feet like an amnesiac zombie formerly known as "Star Trek: Voyager," it just resigned itself to keeling right back over by season two. Retread plots, inconsistent characterizations, and a thumb to the nose regarding continuity with the original series were just some of the offenses that helped drive millions of viewers away. Most of the blame rests with the producers, who seemingly saw fit to endorse these obvious shenanigans, and the writers, who took a paint-by-numbers approach to plot and dialogue. Scott Bakula, despite a fine turn in "Quantum Leap," continues to register "zero" in the charisma department; it's amazing that William Shatner is so often lampooned for his staccato and swagger in later episodes of the original series when Bakula, with his herky-jerky, angry-for-no-reason approach to Jonathan Archer, is just as affected in his acting style--he's simply not remotely as effective. The rest of the cast is fine. In fact, Connor Trinneer, Jolene Blalock, and John Billingsley easily could have carried the show without Bakula, even if the producers and writers insisted on propping up his bland character as someone of significance while making the others look like sycophantic observers. Too bad the U.S. ethnic minorities on the show generally get less attention than the guest aliens of the week or the many cumbersome and jargony phrases that no real person would utter, like "polarize the hull plating." However, many episodes of season two are blessed with topnotch special effects, so there are pretty pictures to look at, even if the pacing and music that accompany them are usually as directionless as space itself.By season three, "Star Trek: Enterprise" started to show signs of life, even if it had turned into a soap-operatic serial involving a "Star Wars"-ish race to stop a planet-killing weapon. The best season easily is its last--save for the high-school-quality "Daedalus" and the insultingly awful "These Are the Voyages." Cheers to Manny Coto for a valiant effort at breathing life back into a series so determined to commit dramatic suicide. Too bad he wasn't around from the beginning, when it would really have mattered.

With &quot;Kill Bill, Volume One,&quot; Quentin Tarantino, whose near-miss &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; deserves more audience acclaim than it gets, finally manages to make a bonafide film, as opposed to bloody, low-budget romps like the vastly overrated &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and the better but stagey &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot; Here, he confidently frames scenes, uses music and dialogue to maximum effect, and knows when to back off and let his actors carry scenes that are truly cinematic (even if they, too, seem lifted from &quot;Thunderball,&quot; &quot;Goldfinger,&quot; and any number of martial arts movies and 60s westerns). Of course, those of us old enough to recall that American television pretty much churned out watered-down versions of this stuff every week may wonder what the fuss is all about and why the heck it takes so long to make it, but compared to most so-called films today, &quot;Kill Bill, Volume One&quot; shows a level of competence that is generally lacking. The plot--if there is one--is simple: An assassin known here only as &quot;The Bride&quot; (played with exceptional vigor by Amazonian Uma Thurman) seeks revenge against her former comrades, whose death squad turns her wedding rehearsal into a massacre. Their leader--the enigmatic &quot;Bill&quot;--is voiced by 70s favorite David Carradine with gravelly menace, reminding us that too many great actors (including Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu) have to suffer through lousy roles before finding their mark. Refusing to abandon his patchwork approach to story-telling, Tarantino nonetheless keeps the pace of his film high-octane, even in more thoughtful moments, bridging the otherwise disjointed elements nicely, and it is to his credit that each scene is charged with emotional electricity--and enough action to satisfy even the most jaded of moviegoers. Though &quot;Kill Bill, Volume Two&quot; features much more and better character development, not much in the sequel comes close to eclipsing the sheer adrenaline of this film's climax--nor the sheer beauty of being transformed, the way film should, from one environment to the next, here with just the sliding of a paper door. It's also to Tarantino's credit that the film loses something in the transfer from large to small screen, something rare in contemporary movies, which generally seem like big TV shows. His vision is such pure cinema that my only real gripe is that on the small screen we can't quite savor it the same way.

"Baby Boy" tells an all-too-familiar story of an aimless, oversexed young man whose gifts in life seem undeserved, yet ironically bountiful. Already the much-absent father of two young children by two different women who compete for his attention, 20-year-old Jody spends most of his time predictably drifting about, riding his bike, getting high, building models, or butting heads with his self-indulgent mother's ex-con boyfriend, Melvin. For the characters in "Baby Boy," life generally doesn't get lived so much as it just happens--and while there is a natural flow to the story, one gets the impression that everyone just reacts to events without ever trying to influence them, making them quite passive despite the tough talk and urban attitude. What's left then is simple pathos, meaning you're either charmed or amused by the characters or--as too often happened for me--not. It's a shame because the performances seem sincere, even if Tyrese Gibson and Ving Rhames compete with one another over who can talk lower and be more stoic, and director Singleton stages his scenes with great effort. But without the distraction of having to really care about what happens to most of the people in the story, it's also easy to see the rather one-dimensional treatment of the male and female characters: the men simply want sex and food; the women simply want sex and a man. That makes sense for the younger characters, perhaps, but everyone in the film--including the older adults--seem programmed in this juvenile way. In the end, the plot boils down to a simple choice for Jody, and though the movie does have a happy ending, it nonetheless feels robbed of its full dramatic power. Once again, art imitating life doesn't always make art meaningful.

I admit a love-hate relationship with books about Asian-American issues. Too often, they recycle the same points - the Yellow Peril, the Japanese-American internment, the Vincent Chin murder, the "model minority" myth, the L.A. riots - and, too often, they offer much discussion but little solution. Let's face it: we live in a nation founded by displaced Europeans and driven primarily by greed and marketplace. It's unlikely that anyone who doesn't fit easily into the mainstream can or will succeed fully, no matter having a claim to moral high ground.As a group, Asian Americans have done better than some others, but not without significant barriers, and in a country where the fire of national debate on black and white issues is stoked routinely by self-serving pundits, politicians, and pop stars, the tribulations of Asian Americans are considered trivial. The irony, of course, is that worldwide, Asians are the majority, and despite NASA's assertion on the Voyager probe that Earth men look like the da Vinci drawing, the reality is that most men look like Wu. Or me, half-Asian though I am.So, while there is a place for books like Wu's, I'm just not sure where it is. Wu is a good writer, even if many of his points are the same ones I've heard since entering college in 1986. His premise that Asian Americans historically and routinely face discrimination, even violence, is an important and all too real one. But I don't know who he's writing to. Is it other Asian Americans? Unless we're in denial or brain dead, we already know the score. Is it non-Asian Americans? Oddly enough, there's a similar problem. Those people thoughtful enough to care have probably heard the issues before. Those who aren't don't want to. Of course, I'm exaggerating here, but without a national platform, all the books in the world about Asian-American issues won't make much of a difference. And there is no national platform to speak of.I say all this having been born the same year as Wu, grown up a stone's throw from him in Toledo, and faced much of the same bigotry that he did (and still does). I probably watched Johnny Sokko with him on WXON-TV, Channel 20, though I remember the show being in color. I recall my parents teaching their children the right values, and more importantly, actually living them. I'm even an academic. As nostalgia, Wu's book makes a connection for me, and perhaps this is its greatest value: allowing people who've had similar experiences to realize they're not alone. But that gives it more therapeutic than pedagogical or political value. After all this time, I'm ready for the latter.

Many people see Frank Perry's film of Evan Hunter's novel "Last Summer" -- a brutally honest coming-of-age story -- as an adaptation of "The Lord of the Flies." It is, at least generally. The problem with over-relying on that categorization, though, is it's too limiting. Golding's novel puts characters into the extraordinary situation of being marooned on an island, where they build a violent, grotesque caricature of civilization. In "Last Summer," civilization is nothing more than violent and grotesque, and there doesn't appear to be anything extraordinary about that condition, at least not for three affluent teenagers who become fast allies on a resort island. Notice that I didn't say "friends," as that would be too humane. Of them, Peter (Richard Thomas, of "The Waltons"), comes closest to possessing redemptive self-awareness; good-time Charlie, Dan (Bruce Davison), furthest. Most devious is Sandy (Barbara Hershey in one of many sexpot roles). Pretty, crafty, and dangerously self-absorbed, she wields sexuality, corrupted in part by the advances of her mother's boyfriend (a brief but creepy rendition by Conrad Bain, of "Different Strokes"), to cruel ends, not the least of which is catty gamesmanship with Rhoda (Catherine Burns), a vulnerable misfit from Cleveland whose loneliness unwisely propels her to insinuate herself into their threesome. What makes the story work, beyond honesty, is the subtlety in which it manipulates the audience. The early rescue of a seagull by Sandy, against the protests of the disinterested but horny boys, morphs into an examination of control and the lengths she will go to have it . . . as well as the penalty for its loss. That theme runs throughout the story, as we witness what at first just seems teens experiencing the sometimes clumsy, sometimes illuminating trial-and-error of growing up. A key scene where the boys simultaneously feel Sandy up in a movie theater starts out as a familiar if edgy burlesque of teen lust; it ends as a commentary on her narcissism and their wanton participation in it. But long before the privileged trio dupe a Hispanic man into drunken humiliation and a beating, we have come to fear what they are capable of and to pity anyone in their path. "Last Summer" is burdened with sometimes stiff acting, and Perry's direction gets hamfisted at the end, but its examination of the politics of inclusion and exclusion, of selfish kids left to their own devices by selfish parents too busy with their own lives, and even of the cancerous omnipresence of racism, divorce, and competition in white society, all get surprisingly genuine examination. And you'll see echoes of what's here in later movies, from "Dangerous Liaisons" (itself taken from a much earlier novel) to "Summer of '42" to "Shallow Grave." You may be shocked by the ending. You may be even more shocked that in the 40 years since the film was made, not much has changed in either society or, for too many people, the human condition.

Well, "Flypaper" is another "Pulp Fiction" wannabe--a little more funny, a little less bloody, which is probably the best thing about the movie. That and John McGinley's cartoonish reduction from human being to Wile E. Coyote (the funniest bit is when he plummets into the street from a moving ambulance . . . watch carefully to see a shoe pop off.) With a series of overlapping storylines--none of which is particularly compelling--the movie is less a narrative and more a teenager's intoxicated Saturday night romp from one adventure to another. The cast is quite capable, and even cable TV junk-movie favorite Craig Sheffer manages to turn in a decent performance, though Lucy Liu and "Ferris Bueller"'s Jeffrey Lewis are particularly engaging in smaller bits. Of course, the movie also benefits from a lack of Quentin Tarantino, as well as the wonderfully dependable Robert Loggia. There is no ultra-hip soundtrack (a truly cheesy techno track is about all we get), and other than getting to see Ms. Liu nude, there's no real point to the sex scenes, meaning that the "adultness" of the movie seems gratuitous. Still, I've seen worse ("Body of Evidence"), meaning that the movie is worth a look rented from the library or seen on cable.

I always thought that Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen deserved much better careers than they've had so far. Don't get me wrong; both have turned in solid performances in other projects, but their talents generally seemed underutilized, perhaps because their films are not always top drawer. Take the scene in "Sideways" where the uncertain Giamatti chickens out of being seduced by the lovely Madsen -- had their performances not been so impeccable, and had the writing not been so dead on, I might not enjoy the film as much as I do. As it stands, "Sideways" is more a collection of scenes, some good, some great, than a movie, but that doesn't stop it from shining in many moments, including a would-be golf course rumble and the gutbuster where the usually annoying Sandra Oh gets to kick the daylights out of the usually annoying Thomas Haden Church. And while I could have done without having to see the latter's backside while enjoying the carnal pleasures of the former, I do admire the willingness of the actors to go with the moment in their performances. "Sideways" suffers from the usual Hollywood overhype -- it's a charming film but not a particularly revelatory or remarkable one -- but adult audiences in middle age or creeping toward it will likely crack a smile and shed a well deserved tear despite themselves.

I saw "War of the Worlds" for two basic reasons: I'm a fan of the George Pal original and the H.G. Wells novel, and I'd hoped beyond all hope to see Tom Cruise get vaporized onscreen. That's nothing against Cruise personally; it's just that I'd rather see a character played by him get vaporized early on than actually have to watch Cruise for an entire film.This is not a new feeling, one born of his juvenile antics on "Oprah" and rumored efforts to eschew whispers of homosexuality by pawing at Katie Holmes in public every chance he gets, but a yearning I have harbored for years. Of course, Hollywood disappointed me again, in much the same way that I had to sit all the way through "Titanic" before finally getting to see Leonardo DiCaprio's character drown.That's not to say that Cruise's character is a true disappointment. He's exactly the hotheaded, neaderthalic, juiced-up on steroids, ex-high school suburban wrestler type that Cruise should always be cast as, as it seems he was bred for just such roles. In this, his performance is right on target. As the de facto leader of the clan he helped pro-create and little else, he would seem more like one of the kids -- angry, resentful, clueless -- if not for Dakota Fanning, who in a sometimes truly creepy way seems to be a middle-aged woman trapped in little girl's body. Like the extras, they all spend most of their time running and hiding in this film (when not bickering), which is just one reason the plot and pacing seem so lethargic: Aren't characters supposed to actually confront their obstacles?The story stays more or less with the Wells original in that Martians invade Earth, though there's a twist: the invasion actually happened millions of years ago. For reasons unknown and easily explained by a simple speculative conversation between scientists that never materializes, war machines come suddenly to life, bent on exterminating all humans in their path and transforming the planet into a Martian paradise. That's pretty much all that happens, with the exception of a brief foray into lunacy with Tim Robbins.Unless you see yourself in the characters, you don't really care much whether they survive or not, and the film makes little effort to change your mind. (Unlike the Pal film, which was steeped in pathos and not a little bit of intelligence, this one is more interested in mood and atmosphere than character; for a lesson from the former, watch the scene where the minister, a good, decent man, tries to make peace with the Martians before he -- and the surrounding army -- get confirmation that this is an invasion, not a visit.)There are moments that unintentionally mystify, such as how a mechanic is oblivous to WW III happening a couple of blocks from his shop, Cruise's daughter not only suddenly losing her claustrophobia but actually hiding in several dark and enclosed spaces without effort or protest, the fact that aliens have engineered a complex invasion and mastered interstellar space travel but somehow don't think to put some clothes on before they start the fireworks, and why the army doesn't just blow the ground from underneath the rampaging machines instead of trying to attack them from above. Sci-fi used to be for smart people.In the end, Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" is mostly an overhyped, underdeveloped special effects film which delivers a few innovations in visual and audio pyrotechnics (though even they are limited; the film's big battle all happens on the other side of a hill). The characters are cardboard, the story is virtually nonexistent, the product placement is obvious -- but, hey, that's what the market wants nowadays, right? And Spielberg is the king of Hollywood marketing, at least for audiences that are willing to shell out [...] for the viewing and then more for the DVD. I will say, though, that it was nice to see cameos by Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, stars of Pal's superior 1953 version, though it would have been nicer if they'd been in a better movie.

Once in a while, I'm in the mood for raunchy. Well, raunchy and stupid. "American Pie" comes to mind, as does "The 40 Year-Old Virgin." Don't get me wrong. There's some really funny, creative comedy in those movies, and I about fell off an elliptical once while watching "Superbad" because I was laughing so hard. I just mean that the plots aren't going to rivet you, the dialogue isn't going to be enlightening so much as it is wickedly creative or just plain nasty. And funny. "Zach and Miri Make a Porno" is exactly that kind of movie. Its story -- that two sexless roommates decide to make a porn film to help pay the rent -- is utter tripe and so well beyond anything resembling reality, you just have to smile and go with it. Seth Rogen, who is funnier than he looks, is Zach, and Elizabeth Banks, who is prettier than she is funny, is Miri, and they make perfect sense as sexless roommates, and, hard as it is to believe, as a couple that never realized how much they loved each other. It's a testament to the charm of a movie that drops the F-bomb at least 200 times and features enough nudity and bodily functions to remind me of college that somehow the romance seems sweet and more important than the rest. I won't say much more -- "Zach and Miri Make a Porno" is about the experience, not the idea, and though Kevin Smith does a Judd Apatow impression, he makes a movie that seems much more put-together than his usual Gen-X sketchiness. One more word, though, about the romantic angle. It manages to make you believe the cliches that wrongs in love can be righted, that second and even third chances are possible if people truly love each other, and that two people who should be together actually make it. In this, it is more fantastic than a real porno but a lot more fulfilling.

Funnier than the previous season - itself gut-busting- but with its sources more obvious, "The Venture Brothers: Season Two" should please fans of what is arguably Adult Swim's best original series. This season is now completely serialized, with episodes filling in the gaps of both plot and character but adopting the soap operatic form of shows like "24" and "ER." Once again, the scientific world's greatest failed genius, Dr. Thaddeus Venture, takes on the superhero world's greatest failed villains, most notably his arch nemesis, the always Machiavellian and delightful Monarch. Answers to questions from the previous season include how the Monarch gets out of prison, what is the nature of the Venture Brothers' existence (including how they survive all of their deadly pratfalls), and who is the mastermind behind the Guild of Calamitous Intent. The season is more gag-driven, with time paid to both slapstick, such as Dr. Orpheus' repeated, frustrated zapping of an undead enemy that just won't, well, die, and satire, such as the presence of a menacing Henry Kissinger clone (complete with magic murder bag) who nonetheless is a diplomatic romantic, as well as why a company called Franco-American would make Italian food. The ultimate fate of Johnny Quest, whose show "The Venture Brothers" lampoons mercilessly, is a creepy larf, as are some cynical Scooby Doo wannabes. Holst's "Mars" makes it into cartoon history in a way that still has me grinning. The animation and voice work on "The Venture Brothers" is no doubt among the better in the TV business, and J.G. Thirwell's score deserves kudos for sounding original at the same time as it evokes the genre. About the only real weakness is the obviousness of "homages," which, taking a cue from "Family Guy," too frequently seem outright rip offs. You don't even have to look closely to find moments lifted from "You Only Live Twice," "Flash Gordon," "The Empire Strikes Back," "The Shawshank Redemption," "Attack of the Clones," "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "Contact," "Apocalypse Now," and more, though nods to classics like "The Manchurian Candidate" are at least occasionally acknowledged in the scripts. The DVD extras are also nothing spectacular, with the deleted scenes being the more interesting.

Most of the well-known social satires dealing with white-on-black racism share the same strange thing in common: They're not written or directed by African Americans. And while films like "Blazing Saddles" and television programs like "All in the Family" are hilarious and important for their own reasons, they don't seem quite as sincere, if that's the right word, as this film, arguably Melvin Van Peebles' best.The late, great Godfrey Cambridge ("The President's Analyst"; "Cotton Comes to Harlem") stars as Jeff Gerber, a middle-class American boor who delights in meaningless competition, keeping up with the Joneses, and chauvinism without consequences at the office -- in short, a fairly typical suburban guy. His sexless but otherwise happy, narcissistic life has the sort of antiseptic order that probably didn't seem so offensive when Dwight Eisenhower and "Leave It to Beaver" were still more or less fresh in people's minds. But his world is changed irrevocably when the bigoted but unimpeded Gerber awakens one morning to find himself indisputably no longer white -- and privileged -- but black -- and reviled. Thus begins his firsthand experiences with the sort of overt and covert racism writers like Ralph Ellison and Chester Himes have described for years and Eddie Murphy would lampoon on "Saturday Night Live," everything from co-workers suddenly no longer saying hello or bothering to make eye contact to being accused of crimes he didn't commit and barred entry to private clubs.The best thing about "Watermelon Man" is how it shows so much of the viciousness of prejudice rather than lectures or preaches, in a film that starts out broadly comedic but ends with the soberness of prophecy. Key scenes show neighbors turning on him, bribing him in a "golly, no hard feelings" sort of way to leave the neighborhood because his presence will bring property values down; his own wife (Estelle Parsons, shrill as she was on "Roseanne" but with the same proper effect), who prides herself an enlightened liberal until she actually has to take a personal stand on race, deserting him; and his at first seemingly sympathetic doctor, a highly educated and cultured man who thoughtfully concludes the transformation was not the result of an tanning bed accident, as Gerber outrageously supposes, but from having African ancestry -- and then promptly refers his patient to a black physician. Any man of color who has found himself the exotic flavor of the month will understand Gerber's reaction when the packed-and-stacked Scandinavian bombshell secretary beds the boss she found completely unattractive when he was a member of her own race."Watermelon Man" is not perfect -- at times, the comedy tries too hard, even for the era of postmodern camp -- but the social satire hits home, then and now. It's sad, really, that the sentiments at the heart of this film still exist for some people today, after much discussion in the culture, even as it's so obvious how priceless the contributions of African Americans and other people of color have been to the fabric of this great nation. Populated by a strong cast of character actors, including Howard Caine, SS Major Hochstettler of "Hogan's Heroes" fame, it reminds us how race underpins so much of our mean-spirited treatment of one another, and while the film is not hopeless -- most obvious in Gerber's children, about the only people in the movie who seem unfazed by their father's rebirth as a black man -- the revolutionary message at the end is bittersweet, as Gerber finds resigned solace in the one place America allows him even the suggestion of freedom. The final shot of the film reminds us that our futures are rooted in the present, and our civilization is measured by either the kindness or the coarseness of how we treat each other. It may seem trite, but that sentiment is as important today as it was over 40 years ago.

As with the lackluster TV series it supports, Dennis McCarthy's &quot;Enterprise&quot; soundtrack relies more on technical prowess than creativity or energy to keep the audience's attention, meaning that listeners will likely forget most of his work not long after hearing it. He does best with his &quot;Klingon&quot; tracks, which feature strong beats and a genuine sense of drive; they are nice complements to the Jerry Goldsmith originals from which some elements seem lifted. The rest of the CD is &quot;mushy&quot; and conservative, with weak melodies and few moments that speak to the high adventure the series claims to be about. McCarthy's over-reliance on atonal horns and strings, in particular, gives the soundtrack a sense of lethargy. Still, ironically, the tracks sound much better here than on the show, where they are often relegated to sneaking around in the background. Russell Watson's theme song is a fairly standard warbling of the kind played in dentist's offices, neither offensive nor uplifting.

Generally I cringe at contemporary adaptations of classics -- witness Demi Moore's drive-by shooting on "The Scarlet Letter" years ago or what can best be described as cinematic cancer in the redux of "Charade" called "The Truth About Charlie." Just let it alone. But once awhile, something comes along that renews my hope that maybe as a society we aren't getting better technological while getting stupider culturally. That something would be "Sherlock." Sure, it can source material that's been around more than 100 years and made into countless TV shows and movies, but "Sherlock" rises above simply being yet another crass attempt at cashing in on a brand name. Benedict Cumberbatch's Holmes manages to avoid the histrionics of Jeremy Brett's oft-lauded portrayal, the tweaked-on-coke quirkiness of Robert Downey's, and the gentlemanly cultivation of Basil Rathbone's to create a Holmes that is both unique and authentic at the same time. No, this isn't the Holmes of the books, but in the same way as Daniel Craig's Bond isn't quite the one you've seen before -- but is -- Cumberbatch manages to keep the essence of the character while allowing him to inhabit a completely different "skin." Set in the current day, "Sherlock" engages Holmes in plots that echo the original stories while being decidedly modern, and manages to do it satisfyingly. The production is top-notch: directing, writing, acting. And Martin Freeman, as a mensch-y Dr. Watson, matches Cumberbatch in bringing something fresh to a well-liked and well-known character. Even Andrew Scott's Moriarty, while cribbing a bit too much from Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, is a more interesting villain than typically seen these days. "Sherlock" may in fact be too smart for television; it manages to do more with the Holmes character than the entertaining but vapid Downey film versions of late, and it is consistent in its execution. I'm eagerly awaiting the third season of this terrific series.

Okay, let's assume for the sake of argument that Stephen King has made a career out of recycling better projects than the one he produces for audiences that, let's say, don't know the source. That makes him a marketing genius more than a literary one and a very rich man. Then, let's say that a decent filmmaker like Frank Darabont gets ahold of the project and decides to try to one-up the master. He keeps the essence of the original story -- itself a pastiche -- and tries to give the story more gravitas than it deserves. The result would be "The Mist," a movie most known for its "courageous" ending. There's nothing courageous about it, both because it's probably the cheapest ending possible to wring horror out of the audience and because it's a re-working of the ending to "Five Came Back," itself remade several times. What is "Five Came Back," you say? It's the story of survivors of a plane crash in the Andes who are being stalked by cannibals and the lengths one of them must go to in the end to ensure the survival of the others. There's skullduggery, tragedy, redemption, sacrifice, and even an old couple at the end that finds themselves in an untenable situation. Oh, and a revolver with too few bullets. Just like "The Mist." But the ending of that film made a bigger point about the humanity of the characters and the irony of their situation. The ending to "The Mist," however, just seems nihilistic for the sake of being so, for effect. Thomas Jane, a sturdy actor constantly being given the slip by stardom, gets stuck in a grocery store right around the time of a trans-dimensional rift that welcomes to earth all manner of freaky bugs whose job it is to kill everyone, preferably in as gory and painfully a way as possible. If you're looking for more story than that, you won't find it, unless you count the better subplot involving a malevolent born-again Christian (Marcia Gay Harden) who is all of those holier-than-thou hypocrites you've known in your life rolled up into one murderously fanatical nutbag. She may be over-the-top, but at least she is interesting. A good cast -- Andre Braugher, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, among others -- is largely underused in this ensemble slaughterhouse, and my hopes that the only character playing against type (brought wonderfully to life by Toby Jones) would not suffer a predictable fate were, of course, dashed. For what it is, "The Mist" is competent, but that's about all it succeeds in being. The "courageous" ending gets tacked on to try to elevate it to heights it cannot achieve nor deserves to. As the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. The greatest horror may be when you're forced to watch it again, as I was. Drinking might help, but my advice is to skip this movie and watch "Five Came Back" instead. There aren't as many bugs, but there is a lot more humanity.

"Limitless" is one of those dopey thrillers that comes along every year, where the filmmaker tries to supplant "smart" with "hip" and "stylish." It's not much of the latter two either, a "Fight Club" redux, only this time instead of a split personality focused on violence it's a no personality focused on super intelligence. Or super memory. I'm not sure because the story never really shows the character being smart so much as acting like a human version of a computer, accessing and processing ideas at the speed of light without really stopping to reason much out. Bradley Cooper -- who looks like Matthew McConaughey and Larry Fine had a baby -- lopes along playing a loser named Eddie pretending to be a writer and generally letting his days slide out from under him effortlessly. His life is a trainwreck until a chance encounter (aren't they all?) with his ex brother in law introduces him to a pill that boosts his mental abilities to the point that he's learning languages in hours and making millions in the stock market. That attracts a lot of publicity, one of the first signs that he isn't too bright, along with loans from the Russian mob, another sign, that cause his life to spiral out of control. "Limitless" dodges all the meaningful questions of what would happen if someone suddenly discovered his mind worked better than anyone else's, the sort of thing novels like "Flowers for Algernon" and its film adaptation tackled 40 years ago. when stories like these were imaginative . . . instead, it lets Eddie act like an out of control frat boy who suddenly discovers sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Robert DeNiro phones in a performance as a corporate raider type. Worse are the women in the story. Abbie Cornish, for instance, plays the standard shallow girlfriend who doesn't want anything more to do with Eddie when he is a loser but is immediately charmed when he becomes a winner -- a particularly unbelievable scene happens when Eddie, suffering from withdrawal, staggers into her workplace, to the understandable shock of everyone, and then remains on the floor while she goes to get his pills and is chased by a knife-wielding assassin . . . all while staying on her cell phone with him. Just another day at the office I suppose. It's worse later when Eddie has to get his hit of the drug from a disgusting source. "Limitless" plays like a 20-year-old's understanding of the world, which is to say it is about chases and one-ups instead of anything meaningful. No one expects a thriller nowadays to be particularly mature, but "Limitless" is, in fact, limitless in its childishness.

"There Will Be Blood" is one of the few films made in recent years that will be long remembered for something more than raking in bucks or featuring the latest flavor of the month topless. That is to say, it's an instant classic. Shot with a lyrical confidence that evokes both Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900" and Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven," it nonetheless firmly establishes its own identity, and if "Boogie Nights" or "Punch-Drunk Love" alone haven't convinced people that Paul Thomas Anderson is the most interesting American director working today, this film certainly should. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's "Oil" (but really having as much to do with "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," with a little "Chinatown" and "Citizen Kane" thrown in), the tragic drama stars Daniel Day-Lewis, perhaps the greatest British actor of his generation, as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive, sociopathic robber baron who in the first scene literally wills himself back to life and crawls across a desert not so much to safety, but to cash in his haul of silver. Those first five minutes tell us everything we need to know about this character, who will go from bad to worse to worse yet in a depiction of unbridled greed that is refreshing in its brutal honesty. In a country where greed is so often depicted in film as divinely ordained, Plainview will seem a theatrical canard to those who catch glimpses of themselves in him, or in his like-minded foil, the duplicitous Reverend Sunday (played with effete menace by Paul Dano). Though Day-Lewis' portrayal sometimes threatens caricature of actor/director John Huston (whose fine works include "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"), and there seems to be an act missing before the disturbing but inevitable climax of the film, it's tough to find any real flaws in the work, whose raw soundtrack by Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood is often as relentless as Plainview himself. If I have one wish for Paul Thomas Anderson, it's that he resist Hollywood overtures to make the next tinny summer blockbuster or moronic Christmas comedy and instead keep plugging away -- he's on course to go down in history as one of America's truly great filmmakers.

Anime being all the rage today (as it was 35 years ago, but in the form of "Kimba" and "Speed Racer"), I would have expected a name like Miyazaki to be attached to the latest charming find. That was not the case with "The Book of Kells," a delightfully imaginative experience whose style and tone evoke some of the Japanese master's work without copying it. The story -- based loosely on the history of the actual Book of Kells, an illuminated Holy manuscript -- is a sensorial experience that melds both Christian and non-Christian ideals as we follow the exploits of Brandon, an orphan who will become central to its creation. Though told from the point of view of a child, the story is decidedly adult, and though not explicit, often not quite kid friendly -- again, like many anime features. But its spirit is aimed at the kid in all of us, from the knowingly familiar tribulations of growing up to the delightful cadre of secondary characters (including the forest spirit, Aisling, and, as a nod to historical accuracy, a diverse range of monks representing many of the great theological artists of the world at that time) to the sly cat Pangur Ban, who is as realistic a feline in temperament as any who has ever graced the screen. The cast is excellent, though the only voice that may be immediately familiar is the always enjoyable Brendan Gleason. True, some people may be put off by the mixing of Celtic and other traditions, but this international production (I counted Irish, Belgian, and Turkish while admiring the end credits, but I'm sure there is more) doesn't ask to be viewed as anything but high entertainment. It succeeds in this admirably.

Easily one of the more interesting actors working today, Bruce Campbell deserves to be in more films. His performance as the aged, "real" Elvis Presley, confined now through a series of goofs to a Texas nursing home, in "Bubba Ho-Tep" is a delightful and perhaps even remarkable testament to his talents. From his grousing about erectile dysfunction to introspection about the failures of his life, Campbell's "King" is enough of a fleshed-out character to make you forget just how silly the plot is. And that pesky bit of business? A soul-stealing mummy is stalking the residents of said nursing home, extracting their life essence in, um, rather disrespectful ways. All that stands between them and nothing is Presley, aided by a man who claims to be JFK (an absolutely delightful Ossie Davis), despite the obvious difference in race. Don't watch "Bubba Ho-Tep" if you're expecting a horror story, though there are a few bumps in the night. Instead, watch it for the great chemistry between Campbell and Davis, as well as some of the decidely foul but funny lines (sometimes a bit too calculated to be the oft-repeated treasures of cult movies). Even with a budget of about $23, it should keep your attention better than many blockbusters today.

Like the colorful film that inspired it, the first season of "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" sometimes feels derivative but on the whole is entertaining, ably mixing sci-fi, submarine fare, and spy stories all into one. Aside from the casting in the lead roles of Richard Basehart and David Hedison, who are every bit as good as the film's Walter Pidgeon and Robert Sterling, these early episodes benefitted from a low-key, realistic tone made all the more atmospheric by the black-and-white photography. Each week, the crew of the Seaview, an experimental submarine, faced threats against democracy, some in the sea and some not. With a para-military flavor, good special effects, creative art direction, and fine guest stars, the first season generally eclipses the more fantastic ones that would follow, despite their being in color. Among the gems are "Secret of the Loch," "Doomsday," "The Mist of Silence," and "Eleven Days to Zero," which reworks some of the plot elements of the film (which would essentially be remade later in the series as "The Sky is on Fire.") As with Allen's other big series, "Lost in Space," reasonable sci-fi would give way to outlandish fantasy, and before the series ended, the poor crew of the Seaview would find themselves battling giant toys, lobster men, and seaweed monsters.

Struggling for the gravitas of its predecessors, "Law & Order: Los Angeles" comes across instead as hollow and chintzy -- perhaps this is an inside joke about its setting, but the results are at best mixed even if one views it ironically.As the lead detective, Skeet Ulrich manages one or two expressions per episode, ranging from stoic to disaffected, while his partner, the baldly glib Corey Stoll, sometimes acts like he's in a show far more jokey than this one. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is likable Terrance Howard, who can't seem to find his sweet spot between being overly dramatic and just wanting to get the scene over with. Alfred Molina fares better as a crusading ADA (though the writers lean too much on his working-class roots to give him dimension) especially while partnered with Megan Boone, whose generic Miley Cyrus-like presence undercuts what is supposed to be a crackerjack legal mind. Rachel Tictotin shows up.If it seems I'm bashing this show, I am. I've been a fan of the Law & Order franchise pretty much since the beginning and have come to expect better, and after 20 years of practice, the writers and producers should be able to provide it, especially now that the original has left the airwaves, Special Victims Unit too often meanders between soap opera and pedophile-of-the-week, and the once-magnificent Criminal Intent has been tinkered with to the point of lobotomy. There's an amateurness to this incarnation: The direction and cinematography are camcorder quality, as if someone diverted from an eight-year-old's backyard birthday party to fire off an episode, and the writing is thin. There is no geography to this series; in the previous ones, the Big Apple was as much a living and breathing character as the people that live there. Here, Los Angeles comes across as some place by the pier. And how is it that even in a show set in LA, there are no major Asian American characters, especially detectives?There is still hope for this series -- the basic formula is proven -- but without a creative transfusion I don't expect it to last very long. If there is nothing else on, it's certainly watchable, but if torn between watching a current episode of this series and an oft-repeated one of the older shows, I'd go for the rerun.

San Bao's beautiful and elegant soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment to Zhang Yimou's beautiful and elegant film, &quot;The Road Home.&quot; Feauturing a lovely melody arranged in multiple forms, the soundtrack carries the haunting emotional force of the multiple love stories that comprise the film--love of husband, love of wife, love of child, love of parent, love of duty. Pure, it is thankfully free of the &quot;wall of sound&quot; approach that so many western soundtracks adopt, making the listening experience as ethereal as hearing gentle rain on a summer night.

I like a good war movie, and by this, I mean gung-ho, yee-ha shoot 'em ups that supplant the grim reality of war with the action and intensity of simple, if violent, competition. Characters suffer in these movies, but never to the degree of reality, with the good guys easy to distinguish from the bad, and even when based on real events, they are generally more fantasy than reality. (Having a father who was a Vietnam era soldier and a mother who witnessed as a child the death of innocents in the Korean War can clarify the difference.)Among the better war movies are "Zulu," "The Guns of Navarone," "Where Eagles Dare," and "Pork Chop Hill." Every once in a while, though, I sneak in a movie about war. They're not the same thing. These kinds of films supplant grim reality for action and intensity. Sometimes they are anti-war, showing the tragic futility of combat to settle differences. Stanley Kubrick's brilliant "Paths of Glory" comes to mind, as does Terrance Malick's "The Thin Red Line." Sometimes they are anti-soldier, depicting the utter barbarity of human beings when left to their own to act out on sadism, racism, or ethnocentrism. These are easier to find in foreign markets than the U.S., where jingoism is so integral a part of culture, but "The Last Valley" and "Casualties of War" qualify.It's easy to blame soldiers -- after all, if they weren't so eager to fight, maybe there wouldn't be war. But until someone improves upon the human condition for too many people, that just seems terribly naive. Still, Hollywood has a habit of wanting to make an anti-war statement once or twice a decade, and the tone generally comes off as anti-soldier. Not "Letters from Iwo Jima," a rather remarkably nuanced film in this regard, made more so because it tells its story from the point of view of the Japanese rather than the Americans. Having grown up seeing the Japanese painted as one-dimensional villains in war movies -- and knowing full well the brutality Japanese soldiers inflicted on my mother's native country of Korea -- I wasn't expecting an American film to move me so easily in its creation of three-dimensional characters. These Japanese soldiers are real human beings, some noble, some cruel, but all like people you actually know rather than the cardboard cutouts of most war movies. Ken Watanabe, at times doing a poor man's Toshiro Mifune, is nonetheless decidedly charismatic in his portraly of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commander of the doomed contingent of Imperial defenders, but Kazunari Ninomiya, as Private Saigo, carries most of the dramatic weight as a cynical teenager coming to terms with the futility of his position. The rest of the cast is equally effective, and Clint Eastwood's direction shows him to be one of the premier American filmmakers of our time.Many people know the historical results of the Battle of Iwo Jima but mostly from the point of view of the Americans, who fought bravely and determinedly and suffered tremendous casualties. But of lesser concern was that of the Japanese. This film, sure to irk some audiences, stresses the latter, though not to the degree of showing one side as better or worse. Instead, the film correctly focuses on the soldiers rather than the battle, and in this, despite the sometimes cruel actions of men on both sides, it becomes a pro-soldier film even if still resonating as anti-war. I don't know if I can watch it more than once, but I'm glad I did watch it.
