After a time of playing cat-and-mouse, Annis and Adam are caught in a compromising situation and are forced to wed. They've both been married before. He deeply loved his first wife, whom he married quite young. Annis fears remarriage because she was practically held prisoner by her first husband who controlled every aspect of her life. Not only does Annis have to fight her fears regarding marriage, but she also must deal with the inadequacies she feels because Adam now faces a marriage that is not based on love. On top of all that, Annis must chaperone two difficult young women, and the folks nearby are near rioting over another landowner's unfair practices. Worse, Annis' cousin works for the villain.All the ingredients for a first-rate novel are there: strong characters, an interesting plot, and unexpected twists & turns. Unfortunately, Cornick can't make it work. Even ignoring some ghastly grammatical errors, Cornick repeatedly makes glaring errors in her research. Or perhaps one should ask if she did any research. A frustrating read.

I admit it: I love Clay; I thought he should have won. This CD proves the point. The melodies draw you in and the lyrics speak to the heart. The songs showcase Clay's amazing voice with a relaxed feeling that was rarely captured on the American Idol show. Yes, there are a couple of &quot;power notes&quot; (as in &quot;The Way&quot;) but mostly the songs manage to relax and energize simultaneously -- and all while remaining passionate and subtly affecting your emotions. Romantic, sad, joyful, shy, hopeful, surprised, resolution, even a touch of anger. Emotionally, the CD is brilliant. And it's very well engineered -- unlike &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; the background vocals don't distract from Clay's voice by being too loud.The acoustic guitar on &quot;Invisible&quot; was a surprise after hearing the song on the AI tour, but it's nice. My only (and slight) disappointment is that &quot;Invisible&quot; fades out rather than keeping the heartbreaking, whispered ending &quot;Oh, wait, I already am&quot; that Clay did in concert. &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; almost has a slight country feel; &quot;No More Sad Songs&quot; is harder both in tone and in the driving percussion. &quot;Run to Me&quot; may be one of the sweetest songs I've ever heard; the sentiment is so rare. The songs weave together beautifully and yet each one presents something different.This is a CD not only to play in the background, but to listen to carefully, letting your ears feast on the rich vocals and the lovely melodies and allowing the passion and emotion of the lyrics to get under your skin. Not too many artists focus on melody and lyrics anymore--Clay's CD is a welcome change.The Measure of a Man is an outstanding first release. And the measure of a great singer and a true American Idol.

Julia Quinn, I think it was, wrote that you weren't alive if you didn't fall in love with Rafe Bancroft. Guess I'm living. I wasn't 1/4 of the way through the book before the delicious and delightful Rafe had captured my heart.Felicity is an excellent match for him, who quickly shows his natural talents as a father with her 8-year-old sister Meg, who's a splendid secondary character.The plot did not bore me, despite moments of feeling that we ought to get on with it, because it was so intertwined with the ups and downs of the romantic relationship. The villain's increasing villainy also helped to keep the tension up.This is a definitive feel-good book. It's witty and charming and romantic. And Rafe?...Ah, go ahead and fall in love with him. Everyone else has.

The hero is quite nice, but the heroine is a bit too odd sometimes. The repartee between them is good and there are steamy love scenes. But the secondary characters are weak or unintentionally creepy and the "magic" is silly, dragging the story down.A very mixed bag. If I'd read it more recently, I might actually lower the rating.

Karen Hawkins could not have made a better debut; this book is so close to perfection that's astounding! I truly cannot understand how anyone can think it average or, shudder, less.I was totally captivated by the time I was halfway through the first chapter. Julia is, argually, one of the best, if not the best romance heroine to date. She is witty, charming, strong of character, and unique. And Alec is that most delightful of creatures, a scandalous rake with a heart of gold. Whether the sparks flying are those of attraction or personality, sparks do fly. Yes, there is only one &quot;love scene,&quot; but they keep getting interrupted! Besides, this story is about so much more than seduction; it's about finding true love and companionship, about dreams coming true, about discovering what's really important in life. It is truly, in every sense, a romance. Sigh.The Adbuction of Julia is why Karen Hawkins has earned a spot at the top of my favorite authors list. Read it immediately!

Teresa Medeiros if one of my favorite authors. Often her novels ring with powerful emotion. Occasionally she does miss the mark. I enjoyed this book, but it's not my favorite. While I liked both of the characters and though the author did a wonderful job of writing, I never became emotionally attached to the lead characters.Samantha's secret actually detracted from the book for me. Her transformation did not ring true. Actually, it was only as her secret began to unfold that I became uneasy with the story. I had really enjoyed the book until then, but at that point, it became too easy, too pat a resolution.It's a good book but flawed, in my opinion.

and I come down in the middle. It's a decent read and keeps the reader involved in the story, despite a few annoyances (like &quot;my dove&quot;). Yes, Lucien is arrogant, but that's typical of most romances; he is, nevertheless, humorous and full of joie de vivre, and those qualities made him likeable for me. Jocelyn is a strong heroine, and the villain's use of her good works as a lure and a torment is effective. Lucien is very protective of her with regards to her family as well.An interesting side note on this series is that it's fairly innocent, making it appropriate for more mature teens. I actually read these books to approve them for my daughter. No, they're not Julia Quinn or Teres Medeiros, but I have also read many that are much worse (one of which was written by Lisa Kleypas). So take it as a light read and enjoy a few hours with a nice vampire.

Despite the fact that I think I'll scream if I have to read the word &quot;maiden&quot; again anytime soon, &quot;My Lord Immortality&quot; had a lot of good things going for it. Amelia is an excellent heroine--intelligent, perceptive, loyal, and brave. Sebastian is interesting as a true scholar with fewer social skills, especially with the ladies, than either Lucien or Gideon. His awkwardness and hesitancy are keys to the romantic tension in the novel. Nevertheless, the attraction sizzles between these two, perhaps more than with the couples in the two previous installments. Indeed, this book is slightly more sensual (though still pretty innocent) than the others. Moreover, Sebastian is that elusive male all women want: one who knows what they want deep down without having to be told.Sebastian, while he's willing to risk his life to protect Amelia, doesn't actually do that much to stop the villains -- who are perhaps the most villainous of the set -- so that somehow seems something of a letdown. Moreover, the surprise twist is not given enough attention and background; I think it directly related to Lucien's book in particular, but nothing was mentioned about that. One thing: so, um, what happens to the Medallion now? The fate of the Medallion and the Veil is not dealt with.A generally pleasant ending for the trilogy.

Oh, dear. So many people recommended this book, saying that they had delayed reading it because of the cheesy title, but it was wonderful. In a word, no.Sure, Laurens is the queen of the panting, highly explicit sex scene, but this book took even that to the point of ridiculousness. Not that that's too hard to do. My biggest beef with this book is that the strong, independent heroine became a total wimp every time the hero came near her. Their relationship was about sex not love; I can't see them making it as a lifetime couple. Jack always has to have the upper hand and Kit always gives in the moment he touches her.Silly.The first books in the Cynster series are Laurens' best -- you know, the ones before she starts getting repetitious.

Except for her hard-to-understand aversion to men like Vane, Patience is a good if slightly ordinary heroine. We eventually understand her reasoning, but it takes time to sympathize. Vane is one of those characters you really want to like, a lot, but Laurens never gives him his due. To me, Vane is never as clearly realized as the rest of the Cynsters.I, however, found it refreshing (having read this series out of order) to have the hero almost immediately realize that this was the woman he wanted to marry and she's the one who needs convincing. The mystery plot was not particularly good; honestly, why could no one figure out the sand any earlier? Geez.But Laurens writes well, and this book is enjoyable, although certainly not the best of the series. I think Vane has been cheated; it's almost as though the author never really understood him. His handling of Patience's brother Gerrard was one of the most insightful elements. Read it as part of the series, but it's hardly the best. Devil's and Scandal's stories are much better.

Ferguson's story contains some major errors regarding the social mores and customs of the period (like kissing -twice- in front of the maid). The characters, however, are strong & likeable. The plot, while well-used, is all romance and moves swiftly. Ignoring the historical gaffes, it's a 3 star piece. By far, the best of the lot.Greene's entry is a very mixed bag. Lucien is great; he really changes over the course of the story. Angela starts out well, but is later seen as self-righteous and unforgiving. It's a great idea for a story (the wager and its effects), and the secondary romance is good. BUT Angela's intractable spirit dulls the execution and enjoyment; she doesn't deserve the changed Lucien. She knows what it's like to be treated badly but does it to him mainly because of his reputation; she's quite rude. She seems no different from Lucien's friends (and what he once was). There are also some plot problems. The resolution was way too fast and utterly unbelieveable. I'll give it 1-2 stars, primarily for Lucien.Huntington's attempt is ... how to put this politely? This is the worst story of the 3. The heroine is generally likeable but needs to be better developed. The hero is charming but wholly vain; he is not a likable romantic hero. And at the end, he seems an entirely different person. The last page refers to his usual expression before Caroline was "haughty and closed," but that was never in evidence in the story. He repeatedly disavows marrige, even to her whom he admits he loves, and then suddenly proposes out of the blue. Even his compliments are sickening -- flowery, overdone, and insincere. Moreover, the reader constantly gets the feeling that she's missing something, that this story was plucked out of another or out of a series to which this story repeatedly refers with a heavy hand. This one rates a zero!

I usually prefer historical romances and read something else just for a change of pace. I don't think this is as good as George's historicals.There were some funny moments and some good chemistry (although sometimes the romance between the lead couple's best friends was spicier than the main romance). The third & fourth romances were unbelieveable and unnecessary. Please! Some of the scenes were silly rather than funny, and yes, far too many cliches were tossed in there. The author also had the bad habit of repeating herself. But there were good moments.My advice is to borrow the book from the library rather than buying it.

I really disliked her in A Summer to Remember. In the next two books, she improved somewhat, but here, in her own story, she blossoms. One reason is that we finally get to see some vulnerability in her; the other favorable factor is her marvelously sarcastic sense of humor. When Josh arrives in Bath, Freyja makes a scene that results in a fake betrothal-- one that her brother, the Duke, insists be maintained for a time.Josh is intrigued by this little hoyden and is one of the few who can put her in her place. She naturally resents that, but even worse is his seeming inability to take anything seriously. He's always winking at her, calling her &quot;sweetheart,&quot; and making kissing gestures, all the sorts of things he knows will infuriate her. But he is far too frivilous to be taken seriously...or so she thinks.The story deals little with the Bedwyn family, although Wulfric appears just enough to make you long for his story. The book focuses more on Josh's family and to good result--we need to see Freyja away from her usual surroundings. When Josh goes to meet his fiance's family, he fits right in. The stranger thing is how close Freyja becomes to his family.It's different (as the series goes) and it works. A Summer to Remember is still my favorite (and worth far more than 5 stars), but I liked this one a great deal.

I docked the book for these reasons: Godfrey's character remains too uncertain throughout the book; it's hard to understand why Clarice wants to return so much after reading all about her grandmother; Robert worries about being like his father, but the reasons for that fear are not clear enough; it's not entirely believeable that a royal princess like Clarice would stoop to essentially being a peddler; and the resolution could be longer, more detailed.By ignoring those minor problems and maintaining the suspension of disbelief, Some Enchanted Evening is a very pleasant way to spend a few hours. Despite some believeability concerns, Clarice is a strong and likeable heroine who steels herself to put duty before love. Robert is a powerful and compelling hero who does not believe she's a princess until halfway through the book. Their love scenes ignite the page, and their sorrow at being parted echoes in the heart.There are some wonderful secondary characters, especially the old men--they're delightful! I'm looking forward to the next book. This one ends with a cliff-hanger -- humorous and exciting, just the thing to generate interest in the Amy's story....it's the wait that gonna be tough.

Fine Feathers I found to be only so-so. It started out well, but soon began to drag with needlessly long and uninspired descriptions. Those were easily skimmed, however. What really rankled was the suddenness of the couple's "love" for each other. I refer not to love at first sight, which can be well done, but to the leads' lack of positive interaction. They think ill of each other, but each suddenly realizes he/she is in love. Heath fails to make it believable. Hal is quite intelligent and Molly is game enough, but this reader never bought into the relationship. The "mystery" overshadowed the romance anyway, and it was only mildly interesting. Too often the characters acted stupidly and the events were just too convenient. The constant repeition of the phrase "fine feathers" was highly annoying. The actions of the characters too often were out of sink with the time period. Two stars.The Makeshift Marriage is by far the better of the too works in this book. The characters are well-conceived, is sometimes too obvious. I was, though, highly disappointed in the doctor; he could have been written in a more noble light with the result that both he and the book would have benefitted from a more emotional and difficult decision. The book is best early on, in Venice and when they first return to London, but it remains interesting throughout. My biggest criticism of the book is its too rapid conclusion. Laura and Nicholas needed more time to turn their misunderstandings around, or at least an epilogue to show the results of it. A more minor criticism is that Nicholas' recovery seemed to drag on too long. However, The Makeshift Marriage is a much better novel than Fine Feathers and deserves to be read. After FF, I hesitated to read TMM, but am glad I did so. Four stars.

Reading these in order, I had expected this to be an improvement on Dark Prince. It wasn't.While I really sympathized with the tortured (literally & figuratively) Jacques, he was so uber macho, that I found him very annoying. Shea was so stubborn in refusing to believe the evidence right before her eyes.The book was very slow, especially at the beginning. Way too much exposition. Eventually, very late in the book, it gets moving, but by then it's nearly too late. Feehan's repetitive use of "little" endearments really grated on my nerves (I'd already had enough in Dark Prince), and I thought I'd scream if I read "I'm a predator" type comments one more time. Geez, enough is enough already. This series is definitely not equal to the hype. One & 1/2 stars.

Maybe I just connected with Dana and Jordan because of their love for books, but I found their romance very realistic with mutual interests, a past history, and having to work through pain and misunderstanding to re-establish trust. Yes, Dana is very angry and that was sometimes off-putting, but anger often masks hurt, and Jordan had hurt her very deeply. Over the long haul, their banter worked for me.Although Dana sometimes seemed less intelligent or intuitive than one would think, it could easily have been the pressure that made things hard to see--that and her early antipathy for Jordan, whom I liked a great deal. I found her to be a more complex character than Mallory (Light) -- same for Jordan compared to Flynn.Although the dog got annoying (even in the first book) and the girl bonding was a bit overdone, the guys being guys made up for it. They were such fun to read about. This entry had the most humor to me. The finding of the key was, I thought, a unique take...much more a couple's thing than Mallory and Flynn.

While this book isn't quite as good as Lisa's best works, it's still a pleasurable read. Heroine Julia Wentworth is that rare thing in the early 1800s--an actress who isn't a prostitute. And, she's married, but no one knows it; after all, that's not her real name. The man she was forced to marry as a child, Damon, Lord Savage, falls for the actress only to discover she's his wife. Intriguing scenario, but as another reviewer mentioned, the reader lands firmly on Damon's side thanks in large part to Julia's hesitancy. Excellent hero.Logan Scott is a fabulous secondary character and appears, as mentioned, in other novels. The triangle between Scott, Julia, and Damon leads to interesting revelations as well. A romance between side characters also adds interest, as do Julia's interactions with her parents. The scheming mistress is the least interesting and least convincing part of the book.Kleypas writes well, as always, but she has only improved over the years. Don't miss this one, but realize that there are better ones, too.

Having accidentally read book # 4 first, let me encourage any reader to read this series in order. This one, Merely Magic, is the first and does a splendid job of setting up Rice's remarkable magical world and the two families that gird the series.The magic of the Malcolm women is unusual, and each one has her own special talent and unique way of looking at the world. Each Ives man is stubborn, arrogant, and scientifically-minded -- what could they possibly have in common? The two families are consistently intriguing and their individual antics, much less the inevitable combustion when they meet, are vastly entertaining. Add an excellent romance, and there is much to enjoy in this delightful book.There are occasions when Drogo's arrogance is irritating and Ninian's submission is annoying, but these character flaws make them more realistic, and one can appreciate the difficulty in making a realtionship between opposites work. The superstition of the villagers and their resulting snubbing plays honestly. There are some historical gaffes, but all in all, it's a great read.

There were moments in which I really enjoyed this book, but often I was thrown out of my state of disbelief bylittle thing like the phrasing of dialogue, the changing sense of continuity between thepast and the "present," or the ferocity of the lust between the main characters (or their counterparts).There was just enough eerieness to keep the mind engaged in the paranormal mystery, but somehow it neverdeveloped into a seamless whole.An air book in places, but hardly a keeper.

I had read only 2 of these authors before, Harris and Davidson. Harris' story was a huge disappointment, my least favorite of the bunch. It was dull, went nowhere, had no spice of any flavor, and only connected to the series by relating (secondhand) what happened to Sookie's long-lost druggie cousin. Skip it. Davidson's carried her trademark style, but plotting similar to Harris' was evident. It was interesting to have a secondary couple take lead rolls in this short story. Middle of the road -- not great but not bad, still one of the top three in the book. I find Davidson amusing.Taylor's story was, I thought, awful. Too dark and "lusty" for me. I never believed for one moment that the two leads were in love with each other. Gives Harris' story a run for worst of the lot. Hamilton writes a very short story, tight and well-plotted, and obviously meshing well with hers series books. It was good enough that I'll consider reading them. Hamilton can write, but I have to read more to know if I'll really like her work. I have the feeling that I would have liked it a lot more if I'd read the series (or at least some of it), but it still falls in the top 2 or 3. A lot of people disliked Knight's story, but I thought it very original -- and that can be tough. She also had strong lead characters and some memorable secondary ones. The longest story, it did have lots of sex, but was (in my opinion) much more tasteful than Taylor's. Does this story connect to other work of hers? She's created a fascinating world, and I'd like to read more of it. I put this story in the top 2 of this anthology.

The Reverend Mother is a sly fox, and she sets up both Peril and Sister Eloise to perfection. Sister Eloise is a delight: bossy, always in trouble, but she means well. It takes her some time to realize that she's really not cut out to be a nun. Peril is a man with too much weight on his shoulders, and he needs someone just like Eloise. And in the process of these two discovering love in the midst of a marriage neither one expected, Peril's (and his village's) past is laid to rest and Eloise's future shines brightly.Much of the humor comes from Eloise's misadventures and mistakes and from Peril's misfortunes, as well as the way they seem to bring out the worst in each other initially and until they recognize their feelings for love and let go of their fears. Nice secondary characters.Charming, witty, original. Occasional instances of anachronisms and very minor plot snags, but all in a all a very enjoyable read.

A sexy, romantic story full of twists and turns, intrigue, suspicions, and misunderstandings -- but in the end, love, freedom, and fulfillment.Although Serena is a little spoiled, her heart's in the right place; she definitely needs someone like Julian to hold the reins. Julian learns that there's more to live than revenge, even regarding his enemy's daughter. Neither character is perfectly likeable, but that seems to make them more human. It does get frustrating sometimes to see how little they trust each other (repeatedly), but trust takes time, especially in their circumstances. In the end, they both learn and grow--as individuals and in love.It's a very long book, which is quite nice when one reads as quickly as I do. I think it's one of Thornton's best; it's different from some of her other better novels, but definitely worth reading.

I like Gabriel a lot. He is charming and witty and sexy, and his charm is based on kindness. Psyche is too self-contained at first, but she shows evidence of her spirit when he puts the odious Percy in his place and becomes infuriated with the "actor" she has hired (Gabriel). Secondary characters appear in the sequel, Lady in Waiting (most to greater advantage).There are problems with the tale, mostly historical inaccuracies, but if you can ignore those, the tale is engrossing and satisfying. Although sometimes taking too long to resolve and sometimes lacking enough motivation, the mysteries and dangers add to the tale's interest and are better integrated into the romance than are the attempts of many others.

This one (#3 in the series) is more about getting to know and appreciate someone than about wild sex, which often seemed to be the only glue holding the couples together in some of the other books. In fact, nothing sexual happens for 2/3 of the book; instead Aidan and Alex get to know each other, making it realistic and romantic and sweet.I also liked the fact that Aidan had humans who took care of him, who shared his life and his secret. It made him more vulnerable, more approachable. This is my favorite of the first 4 books in the series. Sometimes ratings are so hard. This one should be a 3 & 1/2 star rating.

For the most part, I really enjoyed this book. Krinard makes werewolves real and serves up emotional tension with a backhoe. Braden is a complex hero, and not always heroic, but he recognizes his errors and grows as a character. Cassidy remains somewhat innocent throughout the book, but that's part of what appeals to Braden; plus, the hurt and betrayal that strike at her innocence are beautifully rendered, making the reader hurt, too. Her need to be belong is palpable. You can feel the heightened tension when the werewolves are together and challenging each other. There are moments when the book falters (for example, Bredan's fall into his grandfather's outlook and behavior is never fully explained), but it serves as a thorough introduction to the Forster family. The love scenes are the weakest part, and Krinard's euphemisms are so laughable as to almost be more uncomfortable than crass words. Sometimes the exposition is too long or slow, but once the action begins, it moves with good speed.

I loved this book. Not only do we get to revisit some old friends from previous books, but Robert Carroway is a unique and utterly wonderful hero. Gorgeous but tortured, he is believable and sympathetic; Lucinda draws him out of the shell he has become through simple acceptance and then love. Lucinda's &quot;lesson in love&quot; winds up being more a lesson for her than for her intended student; Robert learns a few things, too, thanks to implementing her list.This story is warm, witty, touching, and divinely romantic. These two lovers are perfect for each other and splendid characters in their own right. One of the best in Enoch's series featuring this set of characters (the With This Ring &amp; Lessons in Love series). While it would be nice to read them in order (as I did not) to fully grasp the interconnections, it's not essential. What is essential, is to include this title in your reading.

Fairchild's story is unusual but heartwarming, about a disfigured war veteran and a paragon of virtue and patience. She may be too patient and wise to be believed, and he nearly too weak, but they do get on well together. His dragon of an aunt is thoroughly conceived. All in all, a pleasant and diverting tale. 3 stars.Metzger's story is the best of the bunch, in my opinion. A delightfully convoluted &quot;wish list&quot; holds this witty and quirky tale together. Metzger's clever &quot;trick&quot; of viewing the story from multiple viewpoints with similar phrasing is delightful, is occasionally taken a bit too far. Her characters are finely drawn, especially the secondary ones. Metzger delivers. 4 stars.Kelly's offering is only so-so. It's a fairly interesting situation for the hero but is otherwise blah. There's nothing really special here, and the story is not firmly resolved. The author's style is nice, but the story is not particularly engaging, and there is a sense of it being unfinished. 1 &amp; 1/2 stars.Fairchild's piece is also less-than-wonderful. It involves a thoroughly dastardly brother and a twist of sorts. This tale is more sensual than most in such anthologies. There's some nice imagery, but it's only middling overall. 2 stars.Layton's contribution is a take on Sleeping Beauty--one that is fairly obvious and straightforward. The tale is mildly diverting, but Layton, as usual, is overly wordy, relying too much on description and on &quot;telling&quot; the story. 1 &amp; 1/2 stars.Overall, this anthology is a typical mix and few stories are worth the effort. Metzger's near the top of her form here, however, and Lane is also worth a read.

Like others in the series, this novel delves into details about the hero's life (in this case, his hobby of mountain climbing); that can sometimes cause the pace to drag a bit. The aunt & father were very nearly stereotypes, as was the hero's now-deceased father until the end. Appearances by lead characters from other books (friends of Evan's) do not make any kind of splash here--they just show up and have almost no personality (when they were very intriguing in their own books).Otherwise, however, the book was a very good read with strong leading characters and a few interesting secondary ones, especicially Catriona's brother and some of the climbers. Mores and biases add to the historical detail, and both tension and emotion are usually kept at just the right level. It's a slow burgeoning of a relationship that starts off suddenly but takes time and understanding to grow into sometimes more than attraction...a situation that makes for a more realistic relationship.

This was my first book by Rebecca Hagan Lee, but it won't be my last. Barely a Bride is a delightful read, almost impossible to put down.Griff is a wonderful romantic lead--so sweet &amp; charming &amp; thoughtful. Alyssa is a strong, capable woman who knows her own mind. Their journals &amp; letters add insight to their thoughts and their developing relationship. Their brief honeymoon is incredibly romantic. Griff's time at war is heartbreaking, as is his return home (and his emotional scars).My only real gripe about the book is that Griff's war-induced emotional trauma is dealt with too quickly. Up until that point, the book was practically perfect. Thankfully, the next book (Merely a Groom) indicates that he's still dealing with it, though he continually improves.Both Christina Dodd and Teresa Medeiros recommended this book; they were right. It's utterly delightful.

Each book in this trilogy improved upon the last. Readers of the first 2 books will welcome Nicola's turn at love -- and will enjoy meeting &quot;The Gentleman&quot; highwayman again. Although Jack's distrust of Nicola is sometimes annoying, his sensitivity and goodness overcome it. Their passion ignites the pages, and the suspense is dealt with a sure hand.The saga of evil Richard is concluded satisfactorily, and it is indeed pleasant to have all the main players from the first two books here to take a hand in the outcome. Justice prevails, true love reigns supreme, and the good are rewarded with happiness.After reading this one, I would consider rereading book 1 to see if I'd rate it higher now. I am left, thanks to book three, with a very pleasant, satisfied feeling.

I didn't particularly like the characters; it all felt too contrived. The &quot;mystery&quot; was both convoluted and too easily solved. The romance was neither heartfelt or sensual. The book was simply &quot;blah.&quot; I was often bored, and though I finally made it through, my advice is &quot;Don't waste your time.&quot;

With its terrific evocation of a small Southern town where everybody knows everything about everybody else, North has created a setting that is almost like one of the characters. Jenifer and Eric are solid leads. Their romance is not super hot, but it feels realistic (much more so than many romances). Jenifer is undestandably hesitant to embark upon an affair, and her journey into love is beautifully rendered. There's also a lovely thread about Eric finally coming to feel like he fits in.The mystery is woven seamlessly into the romance, and there are plenty of little details that add to the book's charm and realism. A warm, highly enjoyable read.

Yes, it's not perfect, and I'd have given it 4 & 1/2 stars, if I could. But it, nevertheless, very powerful, romantic, and wonderful.Quill is such a strong but vulnerable hero; he's proud and arrogant, but has a very sweet, compassionate side. Gabby is very naive and innocent, but also wholly natural. Her big flaw is a tendency to make others decisions for them, but she and Quill both learn the hard way...which presented some of the most moving moments of the book. I cried and cried near the end. Quill was exceptionally endearing then.I liked the secondary romance very much, but I wish it had been addressed at the end as well and that the declaration scene had been fleshed out more. The Indian plot was interesting, but for me, not as interesting as the romance and the interplay within Quill's family. Quill's illness, while perhaps a bit farfetched, was more so in its resolution than anywhere else. Still.....happy endings and all.Frankly, it's just a stirring romance, and that's the bottom line.

Fairchild can be an exceedingly good writer; she's not here. Her heroine, Patience, is not very sympathetic. The hero, Richard, is an excellent man, but the anti-hero and love of Patience's life, Pip, is spoiled and self-centered. It takes far too long for Patience's eyes to open...and too much has to happen for her to see him for who he is (and herself, too). She sees only what she wants to see because she is so wrapped up in her feelings for Pip and is always misunderstanding what she sees and hears.In addition, Ms. Fairchild is repetitive (I got so sick of hearing Richard referred to as "dependable Richard") and the book is about twice as long as it needs to be. The constant and not-at-all-clever puns on Patience's name are irritating. On top of all that, social conventions are frequently cast to the wind on nothing more than childhood friendships. Most of the plot could not have happened if Patience had been even mildly chaperoned.Annoying book, despite the stalwart Richard.

Few are as arrogant as Greydon, the Duke of Wycliffe, but it doesn't take too long to see something loveable in him. Better yet, he has definitely met his match in the stubborn and very proper headmistress, Emma. Their wager over the fate of Emma's school provides both hilarity and romance. Their &quot;lessons&quot; are certainly memorable. Though the ending is a little rushed, the proposal is swoon-worthy, and both characters grow admirably through the book.Secondary character Dare is divine; he thankfully gets his own book (The Rake, which is fabulous). The school girls also make memorable secondary characters. And the scene at the pond is just hilarious.Suzanne Enoch is one of my favorite authors; a 4-star read from her is a 6 or better from most others.

It's been a while since I've done that. I'll admit I would have rated it lower until about 1/3-1/2 way through the book. But then it captured me and I couldn't put it down.The prologue links this book with the other two in the series, one of which comes out in March. Although I haven't read the first one, this fact was obvious by the end of chapter one. I'll be heading out for The Rake (first in the series) right away.Saint is definitely a bad boy--a very, very bad boy. He is utterly selfish, manipulative, deceitful, and shameless, caring for no one and nothing. He is also utterly alone. Until Evelyn arrives on the scene, seeking to make a worthwhile contribution to the world and to teach London's Perfect Scoundrel how to be a gentleman with a heart.Saint is dangerous, wicked, and delicious. Despite some comments that she's weak, Evelyn is the perfect foil for him. She's a woman who has been &quot;encouraged&quot; to conform to society's expectation of a harmless, brainless, compliant female. Through the events in the book, she becomes somewhat more assertive and thanks Saint for it. Granted, she somehow still loves her wretched, manipulative brother (How she can think he'd be a good member of Parliament is beyond me. This was the book's flaw, in my opinion.) and she appears resigned to succumb to his marital plans for her because she cannot find a way out once he locks her in her room. But Evelyn's timidity on her own behalf is not only a realistic trait, especially for the time period, but it is also necessary for Saint's redemption. He needs to be concerned about someone other than himself; he needs to be someone's hero, rescuer. He needs to be needed.The proposal was so very romantic, especially after knowing Saint as you do by then. It could not have been more perfect.The book is a little slow at first, but hang in there -- it more than makes up for it later.

Suspense, rather than romance, is the bigggest aspect of Meet Me at Midnight. Victoria and Sinclair seem to be well-suited, but their romance is not entirely convincing. I can't quite put my finger on the problem, but they somehow remain rather vague throughout the story. The solving of the murder is very well done, however, even though I solved it by half-way through; the resolution was well done and suspense was maintained throughout. That, however, is not the point of a romance, nor should it be the main plot. That and the fact that the romance itself was not entirely satisfying is why I give the book only 3 stars. It simply did not keep me engrossed.

The fact that the hero is married (though estranged) makes this romance a little different; it's an impossible love, and Nicholas realizes that att he same time that he can't stay away from Elizabeth. His self sacrifices near the end are wonderfully emotional and compelling. She's a little naive, but very likeable. She certainly has a warm, gentle heart. The murder mystery is very well done. It's not the best Kat Martin that I've read, but it's one of the more enjoyable books I've read lately. The adultery is tough to swallow, but if you can do that, the rest is a pleasure. I definitely need to go back and read Rand's story.

the first thing you need to know is that this is a prequel. Suddenly, Temple is a single fellow who eventually becomes a new friend to Sedgwick (Temple's story is Stealing the Bride, 2003). That can make things pretty confusing when reading this. Something About Emmaline takes place two years after the opening chapter of the previously mentioned book. Other characters from earlier published, but chronologically later books also appear or are referred to. So don't let that throw you when reading this book.Alexander Sedgwick is a delightful hero, whose dull, orderly life is completely thrown into chaos by the presence of his imaginary wife, Emmaline. And he thought being single was tough! The living, breathing, and highly desirable Emmaline is nothing like Alex's imagined bride -- which, as it turns out, makes her absolutely perfect. She's strong, brash, capable, and likeable. But who is she, really? And there are several insurmountable obstacles to a happily ever after, including greedy, conniving relatives, non-existent relatives, relatives back from the dead, less-than-scrupulous relatives, matchmaking servants, and friends and acquaintances of all stripes. This book is well populated with a variety of characters, but somehow doesn't seem overpopulated.Granted there are more than one almost too-much-to-be-believed element, but since they all work together to make the happily ever after possible, they're forgivable. When all the important parties meet head to head, it's an identity free-for-all. And there are many wonderfully amusing scenes as well as some very fine romance.Keep in mind that this is a prequel, and I think you'll enjoy it very much, even with the sometimes outlandish resolutions. You see, Alex and Emmaline are so good for each other, that you, too, dear reader, will go to any lengths to see them together.

Sometimes I liked Tomas very much; other times he was very spoiled and irresponsible. Rowena, too, was sometimes likeable and sometimes uninteresting or "stupid" & rashly stubborn. What was really good was the way Tomas got Rowena to open up and relax, to accept her "wolfness". I agree with another reviewer that some of the secondary characters were as interesting (if not more so at times) than the main characters. All in all, it's just average.

I had looked forward to Morgan's story, but found this book disappointing. Morgan is not as compelling as he appeared in After the Abduction, and Clara lacks the caution that years of working in a crime-ridden area ought to foster. Moreover, she is supposed to be a very proper lady, but rarely acts it. Thus her characterization seems to be at odds with itself.On the other hand, they do have chemistry, and there are times that Morgan's past hurts &amp; fears suffuse the story with deeper emotions.Few of the secondary characters have well-differentiated personalities. The villain turns out to be a cowardly bully, and the secondary plots are little more than fluff. Too much time &amp; space was devoted to the home and the pickpockets. That assessment might be different if they had been linked more with Morgan's childhood.By the way, the cover art, while evocative, is highly inaccurate--Clara has brown hair. Annoying when they do that.

Viscount Ravenswood is seriously arrogant and haughty....on the surface. And he says and does some truly awful things to Abigail...but then he's trying to push her away. In the end, the man Abigail first fell in love with (the softer man that almost no one sees) comes to the fore as Ravenswood discovers that it's not his place to direct the lives of everyone around him. The warm-hearted and brave Abigail is just the woman he needs to teach him some hard truths and to love him just the same. And part of that lesson comes when she tries to be what she thinks he wants -- tear-jerker material there.The &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding Ravenswood's brother's disappearance is kept at just the right level, keeping the reader just unsure enough of the truth to stay with the unravelling.Sensuality? I liked the scene in the theatre hallway. :-)I thoroughly enjoyed the book and thought it was a solid story with emotional depth.

but found them to be without foundation. While this book is not quite as good as the other two it he series, especially the first, (which do need to be read before this one) I nevertheless enjoyed it a great deal.Sebastian is so torn, trying so hard to do the right thing and always missing it by a mile; he never really realizes the truth of what he's made of his life until the very end. Juliet is not really immature, not as she was in the previous book. She has grown up a great deal, but she is still fairly innocent even as she learns to be crafty and determined. Indeed her family thinks her immature and naive, and it is that belief that, to a large extent, set in motion the events that led to this book. But Sebastian is in dire need of her outlook on life and her personality, just as she needs his steadying influence.Sometimes you knock them each upside the head, but in the end it all works out as it should. The book isn't perfect and isn't Jeffries' best, but it is a pleasant read and is a fitting ending to the Laverick sisters' trilogy. 3 and 1/2 starsHmmm...has she written a book on brother Morgan?

This entry in the series offers good background on the Carpathians and on Gregori in particular. I was really looking forward to his story, but he was SO bossy, so ultra alpha male. He eventually starts to learn, but it's no wonder Savannah was frightened of him and of life with him. And she was so young.This series seems to have a lot of gratuitous sex instead of those scenes furthering the plot and the relationship of two people. This book had some great human characters who helped "humanize" Gregori. This elevated the book and his character. The book was pretty good but hardly great. My rating hovers somewhere around a 3.

This is my first Sabrina Jeffries book, but it won't be my last. The cast of characters was unique and provided a wealth of amusing by-play. Rosalind is definitely tempestous and bold, but her quirkiness makes her stand out from the crowd. Griff's ambition (and the old emotional scars from which it springs)blinds him to all else...until he meets Sabrina. Suddenly he can't get enough of a woman he'd have never considered before. Deceit, however, nearly tears them apart until Griff is forced to take a good, hard look at himself.The story is witty and sexy and has that most noble of all romantic notions--that true love changes people for the better.

Teresa Medeiros has become one of my favorite romance authors in part because of the vision she repeatedly presents of the transforming power of love. In this tale, a young woman's desire to provide a home for her siblings leads her to concoct a story that will secure their future. Her manipulation of the amnesia-ridden Lord Devonbrooke is a wrong action based on good motives. Bad idea, yeah. But the heroine does mean well and the couple does fall in love. So he acts differently while his memory is impaired; the story evolves to show that under the hurts and abuse of his early life, his character is truly that which the heroine fell in love with, indeed the man he probably would have been if his childhood had been different. Moreover, the truths lie in the heart in this story, not in the external details.There is emotional depth here, a smattering of well-placed humor, and plenty of romance and passion. Plus Medeiros always-engaging style. Neither the hero nor the heroine is perfect, but the reader comes to believe that they are perfect for each other. And Laura's love for Sterling and his love for her heal the wounds of his past.Read the chapter headings back to back; they form a whole as well as intros to each chapter. Recognize the cat motif for what it is. Don't let the naysayers keep you from reading this book. Sometimes we all need to believe in fairy tales.

I really liked this book by Heyer. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the lack of romantic feeling by the heroine until the end of the book.Sylvester is witty, well-paced, and evocative of the age. Obvious (and delightful) parallels to Jane Austin, especially Pride and Prejudice, abound. Sylvester is a great hero, flawed but teachable. Phoebe is slightly less compelling as the heroine, coming across as a bit immature, but she can certainly hold her own with Sylvester and many others (her step-mother being the odd exception).Secondary characters, especially Thomas, are delightful and add greatly to the story. Witty &amp; charming, with a certain poignancy to Phoebe's self-esteem issues. It's nice to have a heroine who isn't a beauty, too. A must read.

The two stars is for Road to Ruin only!! It's a decent story although somewhat slow. A fake marriage of convenience, a false charge of murder, and a trumped-up scandal -- plenty to work with here.Metzger's 3 short stories, however, are abysmal. The first is mildly entertaining only becuase if the hero's terror of losing his hair. The second is fairly interesting even though the reader can sense what's going on from the very start, until the the end when the revelation of the truth makes absolutely no difference. The third story is so ridiculous that I can't even discuss it. One word will suffice--Elvis! Egads! All 3 equal a big fat zero.

the end. It was far too abrupt and made their love, especially Rose's love for Gunnar, not ring true.The issues between Gunnar and Rose are trust and, for her, love. She is used to the men in her using her as a pawn and being completely untrustworthy. Plus, she learned to reject love from a co-dependent mother. Gunnar is tired of his mercenary life and looks forward to a home of his own; unfortunately for him, Rose isn't the triator he thinks she is, so he's not comfortable taking her home as his reward for foiling the plot against his lord, Radulf (The Lily & the Sword). Since he's playing a role and therefore lying to Rose about who he is and his purposes there, trust again is a big issue.DO NOT READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED. I have no problems with Gunnar or his interactions with Rose. The problem with the book is that Rose doesn't even admit to herself that she loves Gunnar until the next to the last page. And while she accepts that she should have been more trusting, she doesn't tell him until the last page. A couple of &quot;I love you's&quot; and the book is over. There's not enough there to make the reader feel the truth of Rose's change of heart.Other than the abrupt, unsatisfying ending, the book held my attention well. Although I wasn't crazy about the dream device, everything else meshed together smoothly. The secondary romance for Gunnar's man Alfred was nice, and it was great to read more about characters from the first book and those featured in the third. Realistic details about distrust among the various peoples, too.

Except for Lily immediately falling into Radulf's bed, which I found wildly unrealistic, I really enjoyed this novel. Radulf makes an excellent hero, showing a wide range of emotions and rightly wrestling with himself regarding his feelings for Lily. For me, Lily was not quite as likeable; I became annoyed with her repeated refusal to accept what she had learned of Radulf instead of caving in to old fears and keeping secrets. The playfulness in their early relationship soured later on, in large part because of Lily's attitudes & actions in this regard.All in all, though, it was a delightful way to spend a few hours.

A Woman of Virtue is an absolutely fabulous romance. While the cover plays up the mystery, the book is very much a romance. No doubt Carlyle's mystery here is nearly perfect, remaining a mystery until very nearly the end, with just enough hints to pull it all together. The interest there never flags. But as good as the mystery is, the romance is even better.That is due primarily to David. Cecilia is a very good heroine. Indeed, compared to most, she's terrific. It is only in comparision to the nearly incomparable David that she pales. (Not that that detracts from the book in this case.) David is one of the best heroes I've ever read, in large part because the reader is absolutely convinced that he loves Cecilia. I don't know that I've ever been more convinced in fiction of a man's love for a woman. This is especially true in the love scenes, which here really are LOVE scenes. More than any other book I can think of, these scenes show the hero's love for the heroine and his deepest emotions about their relationship. Indeed, Carlyle thoroughly shows (not tells) David's emotional state throughout the book. He is a marvel...and absolutely marvelous.Carlyle tops all that off with a superb cast of secondary characters who make you eager to read the next book. This romance is utterly convincing, the mystery consistently diverting, and the whole well worth reading, repeatedly.

Vengeance &amp; hatred begin this novel, but love and honor triumph at its end.I picked this book up not realizing it was the last in a trilogy; one certainly does not have to read the others to thoroughly enjoy this one. Excllent job there.Ivo is a super hero: strong, compelling, honorable, fair, understanding, a knight in every sense. He is the very best thing about this book. Briar is a strong and determined heroine, but there's so much pain &amp; hatred in her that she is often cruel. Although her cutting remarks toward Ivo are a defensive mechanism--and he understands that, marvelous man--it is sometimes difficult to like her because of them. Yes, thay're that cruel, because she knows they hurt him. Although she eventually is healed adn becomes a nicer person, there are moments the reader will think she doesn't deserve him. She is headstrong &amp; never thinks ahead of the moment. Briar's visit to the villain is a case in point; you'd think she's distrustful enough to be wary. A weak plot point, in my opinion.The mystery surrounding Briar's step-mother's death is well-handled for the most part, except that there's no final explanation of the motive. The secondary romance is sweet &amp; warm, very nice. The villain is evil, completely without redeeming qualities, and a consumate actor. His demise is almost too easy.But Ivo in particular raises this book to a high level. The novel moves along at a brisk pace, and the chemistry between the couple is all it should be.

I opened this book with great expectiations, having seen it so highly lauded by many of my favorite authors. It took me quite some time to get into it. I really did not like the Duke early in the book, although I found him highly amusing as the book wore on, and I never really became fond of Leonie--she comes across as immature rather than spirited. The enormous age difference was a little off-putting to me; I'm not convinced this couple represents one of those great love stories, despite the compelling proposal scene.The use of French in the book provided realism, but often left the reader (unless well-versed in French) a bit out of the loop. Very little of the action actually takes place in England; most is in France. By the way, ignore the cover; the book is Georgian in time period. The Duke's revenge &amp; the intrigue behind it is well-played.Although I eventually enjoyed the book, it'll never be one of my favorites. Sorry, fans.

Just listening to a few seconds of each track (well, not Flying Without Wings - I couldn't tolerate even a few seconds of that again) bored me to no end. Yes, Ruben has a smooth voice, but after a few minutes, everything sounds alike. It's too smooth; there's no passion here. When slow songs and rap and R&amp;B and gospel all sound the same, there's a serious problem.For me, this is a complete dud.

Kind of dark near the end, but a very nice book. The heroine, Devona, is a bit young (to me) -- 19 to his 30 -- but she has spirit. Rayne is tortured and wonderful, a gem of a hero.Some details are left out, like why Rayne became (and continues to be) a surgeon, but it's an engrossing story with lots of passion. It got off to a quick start and pretty much kept that pace. The other doctor, though, was an unneccessary distraction.

I really liked this book and almost rated it 5 stars. I tossed away the scientific portions because they felt awkward to me. Fortunately, I also found them unimportant overall. The murder mystery was interesting; Quick certainly kept the suspense up.But the most enjoyable thing for me was the romance. Granted the book was at least 1/2 mystery, but I didn't really expect anything else. Perhaps my lack of expectations caused me to rate it higher than other readers. Certainly expectations have caused me to rate books lower.Anyway, I really liked Elenora and Arthur. I found them to be well-developed and somewhat unusual characters. Arthur reminded me of Georgette Heyer's heroes. Somehow the book had an older feel to it despite the more modern language. I found it a very compelling combination. Arthur's growing admiration for Elenora is utterly convincing, and her dreams she hesitates to dream are very real, speaking vividly to a woman's heart, as does her determination to be practical.I liked it so well, I'm headed off to find another Amanda Quick book to read.

Collum's story is very well done. I have not read her before, but I may now. Excellent, well-drawn, multidimensional charcters; a plot that maintains the reader's interest; good deviations from the usual romance elements and good use of old standards. Very enjoyable. A solid 4 stars, maybe a bit more.The second story (Hinshaw's) is deplorable. I was barely able to get through it. This is some of the worst writing it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. I have read lots of fan fiction that's much better. Giving it even one star would be overly generous.Raleigh's contribution is middle of the road. There's a lot of interesting byplay between the characters, but some of Charlotte's actions nearly make her unworthy as a heroine. Marlow is pretty standard fare. Marlow's friend Henry is a great secondary character; he doesn't appear all that often, but he always makes an impression. 3 stars.

I'm not sure how I feel about this book. I wanted to love it because I liked the first 2 in the series. But for some reason, I felt something was missing in this one. I suppose the heroine, Adele, never really appealed to me.I generally liked Damien--her certainly had no intentions of betraying his cousin Harold--although his wordiness at the end seemed almost out of character.It's not a bad story at all, but for me something I cannot put my finger on seemed to be missing. Because I'm so wishy-washy on it, I'm giving this one 3 stars.

So if you're looking for earlier info, go elsewhere (refers to an earlier version). The information is also selective: on some things, this book provides a great deal of information, more than most in fact (like the Enlightenment philosophers); but it skips over or skims other topics (such as colinization and exploration).In essence, what it covers, it usually covers well, but I personally would supplement to fill in the thin spots. i'd give it 3 & 1/3 stars, if I could.

I'm not usually a big fan of romances set in the American West, but Teresa Medeiros does a bang-up job with this one. Her characters are always memorable: the gun-slinger hero with the mountainous mom and a cringe-worthy quartet of brothers, the music-teacher heroine who sings like a cat screeching but plays a heart-rending violin, the little brother who just wants to experience life so he can write about it, the sheriff who wants to be a dandy, the hilarious residents of Calamity, NM, and so on.The reader really gets to know and like the main characters as they get to know each other. Although they spat, they eventually bring out the best in each other. And Billy Darling is such a romantic at heart; how can Esmerelda keep from falling in love with him?Although it contains elements of danger and heartache, Nobody's Darling is a sweet book, a book that leaves the reader with that pleasant feeling of having spent time with good friends. All the secondary plot elements fit seamlessly. The 120-years-in-the-future epilogue was unique; I'm not sure it worked as well as it might have, but parts of it fit beautifully with the rest of the story.Another triumph for Teresa Medeiros.

The book itself is really simplistic and not particularly interesting. In fact, I was quite bored for about 1/2 of it. However, when Haw finally starts to take action, some of his insights are fairly inspiring. There's really nothing new here, and certainly not all change is good, so don't take the message TOO seriously. It's not ALL attitude, but much of it is. For example, sometimes life just throws stuff at you; when that happens, your attitude does make a difference. The best parts simply encourage you to face your fears and find the good stuff, the silver linings. Make lemonade, to use another cliche.You can easily skip the discussion at the end, and probably the intro as well. Don't expect anything earth-shattering. It's a pep talk, no more, no less. But it can certainly come in handy for that. Best use: Take the best thoughts/quotes, print them out on your computer, and put them up where they'll inspire.

Julia is a very strong heroine who has eschewed the more feminine pursuits in favor of her beloved horses. Because she is a comparatively large woman and not particularly attractive (as opposed to the picture on the cover) as well, she is seen as &quot;mannish.&quot; That description, however, really never makes sense; it is said over and over but never convincingly. On the other hand, Julia definitely believes herself to be unattractive, clumsy, and incapable (except where her horses are concerned). Carr does a splendid job of making Julia's doubts and emotional pain real. Tears welled in my eyes repeatedly on Julia's behalf.Henry, however, is not nearly as sympathetic, and one has to wonder why she had ever developed a crush on him. He softens by the end of the book, but for so long, he was simply cruel (regardless of his reasons). And arrogant is some of the worst ways, never able to conceive that he might be wrong. Not the most sympathetic hero ever created.The secondary characters have potential, but it is largely unrealized. The writing style is clean, but unexceptional. The plot is the usual fare, but almost overburdened by the emphasis on horses. While the love scenes have some sizzle, there is always a melancholy or harsh feel to them.The book is readable, but there are so many much better options.

I frequently contemplated tossing this book, both literally and figuratively. I picked it up based on the other reviews, but it hardly deserves such accolades. The only reason I managed to finish it is that somewhere past halfway through, the author finally caught my attention with the primary romance.Other than that, however, the book is a mess. There are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through, like the one near the end of the book when the hero plans to propose the next day and sets a appointment with the heroine, who thinks she's about to be dismissed as his mother's companion. The next thing you know, it's another day and then another night -- the author added an extra day and no one caught it before publication. In addition, only one secondary character is developed enough to stand out from the crowd; the rest are both interchangeable and changeable. It is as though the author changed the personalities, motivations, and personalities of her characters just to suit her vapid plot. Things happen, not as a result of who the characters are (for that seems to change with alarming regularity), but merely to achieve an end. In other words, most of the action is imposed upon the characters rather than stemming from them. Another example of the wretched characterization is that one of the hero's friends is repeatedly described in terms that make the reader wonder how on earth the two men could possibly be friends.I almost never judge an author by a single book, but this may be one time I do. Give this book a pass. It is not worth your time.

The book was rather slow to start, but it finally clicked and moved well. Part of that stems from having to set the stage for the trilogy and introduce all the characters.Mallory and Flynn are my least favorite leads in this series, but they're okay. Mallory was a little too perfect. She and Flynn are definitely a case of opposites attract, and I found it almost hard to buy that two such different people would be so attracted for the long term.As for the "key" portion of the story, this was extremely well done in this book, with all the pieces nearly flawlessly seamed. Some things were a little obvious, but not so much as to be a problem. The guys were a hoot; they were very realistically presented. And they were such...guys. Much of the humor lay there. I, for one, liked the interplay between the women, too.

Not only is Zoe SuperMom, a Walmart version of Martha Stuart, and a female Bob Villa, she's also the perfect hairstylist, manicurist, etc, etc....she's an entire spa in one person. No one is that good at everything; she was rather unbelieveable. And she was so negative, distrusting, and defensive where Bradley was concerned--made her hard to like sometimes. Of all the guys, Bradley, who is perhaps the best of the three heroes, seemed to me to be the most trustworthy of a trustworthy trio of men. What a sweetheart! And he can do almost anything around the house, in addition to be rich, handsome, generous, and truly kind.Simon, her son, is a terrific kid.....but again, nearly perfect. As much as you love 'em, kids aren't perfect. But he was often the glue that held the book and especially the romance together. And there were some very lovely scenes between Simon and Bradley.The search for the key dragged in this one...it just didn't have the sense of urgency that the other two did, and it should have had more. The actual finding of the key was a letdown, even with the danger that immediately followed. The ending seemed to lack punch. A good series overall, but with some problems, though I'll admit to a few tears toward the end.

Loved the movie -- but then, with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.....Plenty of action, some exciting fight sequences, much more characterization than the first one. The Cerebus scenes got a little old, but most of the movie was excellent. The DVD has some excellent extras, especially regarding &quot;the making of.&quot; As is often the case with deleted scenes, few add anything of interest to the movie itself. Other extra footage was lengthy, informative, and interesting.And then, there's Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.... and in the extras, Hugh Jackman as Hugh Jackman.

(BTW, Moore's review is of the wrong book.)Beverley's story left me a little unsatisfied, probably because this couple admits they may never truly love each other. It's a great story otherwise, and while their admission rings true, it's still something of a letdown.I don't consider this one of Balogh's best, but it's still a powerful read. Although Ursula can be annoyingly waspish at first, the children turn coal into diamonds.Matthews' story is the perhaps the weakest of the bunch because it is relatively undemanding and the romance is not altogether convincing. Still it's a pleasurable read.This is possibly one of Layton's best stories, full of interesting characters, misinterpreted intentions, and a most unusual matchmaker.The resolution of Heath's story comes too quickly, and the ghost is perhaps too obvious, but the romance is a powerful one and the inherent emotions capture the reader.Definitely an anthology to read. In fact, this is my second reading of this book, and it's still enjoyable.

I loved this book. Deightful, totally engaging characters; 2 secondary romances; lots of laughs -- the word play between Austin & Elizabeth is wonderful; passionate elements that hit all the right notes; enough heartache to strike a good balance; and just a touch of mystery.I thought at first that Elizabeth's visions would be a trite device, but the author used it well. She is a wonderful heroine and Austin is also exceptional. The plot device of a couple being forced to marry for her reputation is believeable here because of their characters and the situation. That they realize their suitability early on is a welcome change from many novels.I had trouble putting this one down, and it will definitely go on my "buy" list.

Adrian Hawke is quite delicious, and Hester is a strong, capable heroine. Adrian's faults are those of the typical arrogant male, but he has a good heart. Hester's the one with all the secrets and the more difficult past to conquer. They mesh beautifully together, and one can easily picture them heading back to America.Secondary characters Dulcie, Horace, and Verna are well-conceived and really add to the story. It's a credit to Becnel that not everything is easily resolved; much more realistic.

shake the heroine.... He keeps falling into old patterns, despite wanting to change (but who ever said real change is easy?). She hasn't the wherewithal to resist him physically.Apart from those two occasionally annoying truths, The Heartbreaker is an excellent read. The two older children are marvelously wrought. Phoebe is an independent, responsible woman (except for her inability to resist James' advances). her ready acceptance of the children is an important character trait. James is a man trying to do the right thing to make the best of his past indiscretions, but often failing and trying again. Beneath that he truly loves his children, and that becomes one of his most endearing qualities.The pace rarely flagged and the author usually kept the interest level up. There were moments of realistic tension and emotional pain, and the chemistry between the lovers rang true.Personally, I found this to be one of the most enjoyable books of the series, along with The Bridemaker and The Matchmaker.

something about it is compelling. For me, however, it's not the main characters. I thought this romance was okay. There's not a lot to distinguish it from her other books in this world, even though it adds some to that world.Things that bugged me:Just how many well-over-six-feet, gorgeous, buff, primarily blond men can there be in one city?All the bad guys are gorgeous, too? And the gods?Kenyon seems to confuse sex with romance. Where are the other components of a good relationship? Kenyon rarely allows them to surface; sex is preeminent. Romance in this book comes down to Pez.How convenient that the "savior" is who it is and shows up when he/she does.Good things:Acheron -- I'm dying for a book for himZarek -- Do read this one before his book, Dance with the Devil. There's so much insight into his character here and preparation for his story.Kenyon can definitely write heroes full of angst and painSunshine is a decent heroinethe Pez collectionUnfortunately, the lead couple was only so-so for me. I wasn't really into the book until Acheron and Zarek grabbed me. The last two chapters before the epilogue and some earlier parts with these two are worth reading the book. They hint at the deeper things Kenyon is capable of writing. Too bad this book gets there only with secondary characters.

I loved Kiss Me Forever. Yes, there are a couple of discrepancies, but the book as a whole is so wonderful, that they don't matter much. Christopher (or Kit) and Dixie are terrific characters, their romance is believable, Laurey's vampire world is intriguing, and the suspense is just right. Expertly done. 5 stars.Love Me Forever is not quite as good, leading to the lower overall rating. While Laurey spent a great deal of effort making the setting realistic (I currently reside in the area), the characters and especially the suspense were not quite as well-developed. More to the point, there are many editing errors -- some small like typos and some huge, like saying one thing but doing another or saying something had happened that that not. These things really mar an otherwise fine story and keep it from being as good as the first. Pity, Justin deserved better. Still, it's a good read, and Kiss Me Forever is excellent.

Yes, the heroine is immature and selfish and by the end of the book becomes annoying. Yes, the hero is not as well-developed as I'd like--and he's almost unbelieveably forgiving. I really, though, could not believe why the silly girl wouldn't accept him until she &quot;found herself.&quot; I understood and emphathized with her insecurities early on, but later just wanted her to grow up.In addition, there are plenty of moments that a sensitive reader can really commiserate with Alix's faults, and even more so with the hurts she still carries. It is nice to have an imperfect heroine; I would simply have liked to see her overcome those more quickly. Alex? (Yes, it was a little confusing to have such similar names) Who wouldn't be interested in a guy who's looking for a serious relationship (other than Alix)? And the chemistry is certainly there! Steamy!Having said all that...this remains one of the funniest books I have ever read. I was reading it on a cruise and laughed out loud so many times (often with tears streaming down my face), that I sometimes had to put it down until I could get back to my room so I wouldn't embarrass myself to death. Often I wouldn't manage to stop laughing, reading the next sentence or paragraph, and cackle all over again. This book deserves 4 stars for its humor alone. I'm not a big fan of contemporary romances, but this one is hysterical.I read Noble Intentions after this and didn't care for it. But... Want a romance that'll leave you in stitches? Read Improper English.

Despite a few flaws--mostly pertaining to compromising situations, as though both, especially the heroine, would not be more cautious of her reputation--this book is a delight to read. Witty, warm, and engrossing. The lead characters are fun and suffer none of that annoying tendency to be ridiculously obtuse. They have misunderstandings, but both are smart, thoughtful people who can figure things out well enough that they don't spend most of the book blindly stumbling about with wrong perceptions.Although the resolution of the mysterious financial matters is not completely believeable, the romance is beautifully written and brimming with passion and respect. Harriet is stupidly stubborn at one point, but it allows Steven to play out an interesting proposal scene. Their interplay is lively, sensuous, and loving.No deep heaartache here, just a heart-warming, feel-good romance that hits the right notes and leaves the reader is a great mood.

although it is hardly Laurens' best. No, my major problem with this book is Lauren's recent style affectations. For some inexplicable reason, Laurens has decided that fragments are infinitely better than complete sentences, and so she writes in fragments to the extent that it is often difficult to follow her train of thought. Then she tops it off with a multitude of one-sentence paragraphs. Take these examples:&quot;Couldn't turn away.The connections slowly clarified in her mind.Tristan, she knew, wouldn't turn her away. Wouldn't refuse her.With him, she'd be safe.&quot;(elementary stuff, that.) OR&quot;She was where she belonged. In his arms. With love between them.&quot; (gak!)And those are some that actually make sense. In addition, Laurens has developed the habit of reusing and overusing pet words and phrases. The words and their attendant emotions lose their impact and often become downright silly.Tristan and Leonora are a nice couple, fairly well drawn, especially Leonora, even though I hated that she broke her promise to him. (Yeah, she explains it away as meaning something else, but I didn't buy it.) I'm still not sure how Tristan is different from the rest of the Bastion Club members; they all seemed of a piece in this book. Frankly the setting up of the club is rather boring.The artist's rendering of Tristan is totally yummy, but the story lacked due to the pitfalls of Laurens' adopted style and her penchant for overly-detailed, almost clinical love scenes. This book pushes Laurens, once a favorite, farther down the list of authors to read...she's nowhere near the top now. If you want to read it, borrow it; don't waste your money.

Yes, the book has ideas and events that require a leap of faith (such as her moving into his house), a suspension of disbelief, but--for me--this one was so much better than &quot;The Lady Chosen&quot; that I was quite happy with it. Laurens dropped the silly affectation of writing insipid fragments instead of crafting well-written sentences, making the entire book more readable and more comprehensible.Although the device has been used before, I thought the one-step-at-a-time love scenes were well done, the exception being Laurens' tendency to put scenes in without regard to moving the plot--in this case, the romance--along. She often takes it too far or becomes too technical and the magic &amp; romance are lost.I liked both Alicia and Tony, and I liked his friend Geoffrey. I would like to have seen more of her brothers; they brough a lively dimention to the book and could have deepened her character, which might have made the character's detractors like her better.If Laurens could get back to dealing with the heart, with deep emotion, and putting love scenes within that context and use them to advance the romantic plot, her books would be better. And the mystery was at times tedious and forced; too much talk, not enough action.So, for me, it's better than the last 2 I read from Laurens, but hardly up to Devil's Bride (for instance).

While I generally prefer single title romances from publishers like Avon and Warner Forever, Stancavage's book is one of the better entries in the lesser romance lines. Granted there is some awkward writing here and there, a few times when the historical "way things are done" are ignored, and the occassional contrivance, but overall, Stancavage manages to create a hero and heroine who are likeable and well-suited. A secondary romance and other interesting characters add favorably to the mix. Credibility is stretched from time to time, such as the villain's motive; usually, though, any lack of credibility stems from the oddness of something within the historical setting, but the book is a lighthearted, pleasant read. My biggest con is that it sends quite abruptly with no resolution. Be prepared for that, and you should enjoy the rest.I debated about giving it 3 stars, but it's certainly closer to three than to 2. Give it a try.

This review book contains interesting tidbits that others don't have. It also features good overviews that hit the essentials and a large number of terrific comparative charts. This book makes connections among different civilizations, time periods, topics, and themes. In fact, it's possibly the best book for making connections and drawing conclusions.For lots of details or facts, you'll need something else, too.

Could there be a more inauspicious beginning for a marriage than the one in this book? The hero and heroine literally hate each other, and both have the worst misconceptions about each other (due in large part to the unusual circumstances and the fact that they hardly met before they married). Their initial intimate scenes are not at all romantic and border on uncaring (or worse). But somehow Balogh manages to take these two people through a series of events that leads them to understand and respect each other and to eventually fall in love. It's a tribute to her talent that she can make this transformation credible.Eleanor's family and Randolph's friends make wonderful secondary characters who help turn this marriage of convenience into a love match. And there's more than one happy ending as a result. The book's not perfect; there could have been more evidence of a gradual softening of their feelings toward each other. But in the end, it's all good.

The book opens well, but quickly falters. The heroine, at 24, still acts like a teenager for the first 1/3 of the book. Then the villaness arrives, and Emily becomes a self-esteem basket case. Jacob is, at best, a mediocre hero. He's blind (figuratively), obstinate, and a taker. Lane makes the mistake of telling us what the characters are like rather than revealing them by their words and actions. The latter rarely match her descriptions. Some might say that her characters are flawed, but I found them unsavory (except Richard and Sophie). Yes, a good villaness, but it's hard to believe she got away with all she did. So often, I just couldn't believe that things happened as they did, or that so many characters were so clueless -- and repeated the same mistakes so often. Lane even threw in extraneous obstacles that had no basis in the story. One at the end, in particular, is suddenly held up -- out of nowhere -- as a possible reason for Emily to refuse Jacob. Bizarre.

While this book would be quite good for some authors, it's definitely mediocre for Krahn. There are excellent moments, but the twists and turns are repetitive and almost comical at inapproproate moments. The villains are inconsistent and most are too easily dealt with. The roadblocks are sometimes contrived and not worthy of the weight given them. Brien's father's character alters according to the role he needs to play in the plot. Krahn's descriptions of Aaron's enthusiasm for the opportunity in America is marvelous, though, as are some of the moments for the romantic leads.It's an okay read, certainly better than many, but it has too many faults to be a must read and it's certainly not a must buy.

There was so much sadness in this book that it was never quite overcome by joy (for me). And the obstacles they had to face are not convincingly overcome; this reader is still wary of the happiness of their future. Oh, it will be happy, but there is so much buried still to be dealt with at some future point in time; it's inevitable. For example, her apparent inability to conceive was never resolved.I never fully warmed up to Lily, and many times I wavered as to whether I wanted her or Lauren to wind up with Neville. But he so obviously loved her. I have no idea why some readers didn't like Neville; I thought he was great except for his name. But I was more enchanted with his aunt, Elizabeth, than I was with Lily. And until I read another review, I had no idea that this Lauren is the heroine in A Summer to Remember, possibly my favorite Mary Balogh book. Now I want to reread that one right away.But Balogh's gift for getting to the emotional heart of a story comes through, making this book worth the effort of getting through her sometimes plodding prose. I debated giving this book 3 stars, but I just couldn't do it. 2 &amp; 3/4, yes, but not three.

Although Anthony is a unique hero -- not drop-dead gorgeous or arrogant, but very charming and easy-going -- the plot is so unbelieveable and Georgy's adamant refusals of his attentions are incomprehensible. The secondary romance is also unlikely, although enjoyable to read (and that male a bit wishy-washy). Georgy's little sister is delightful and one of the best characters in the book. The interaction between the two leads in minimal; more happens to each one apart from the other than occurs with them together. Thus, we never get to see the relationship develop and it comes across as artificial.

Three Nights is a lush, sensual, romantic, and exciting tale. Lucien, who seems less than honorable at first, turns into a wonderful romantic lead: sexy, dangerous, and utterly dependable. Aveline is strong and brave, if rather blind to her father's faults. Naturally, it all works out in the end.Betrayal is a featured theme and is supremely executed. Secondary characters add to the intrigue and flesh out the subplots that put obstacles in the lovers' paths. The chemistry between the romantic leads and the love scenes nearly set the pages afire. Yet, it is never clinical or over the top, nor does it slide into purple prose. Instead, even considering the title's three nights, those scenes are ultimately based on romance--its discovery, its loss, its resurrection, and its growth. Well done!

This one's a winner. Aurora and Alex are marvelous, thoroughly realized romantic leads. Watching them get to know each other, spar, and fall in love is thoroughly delightful. The secondary characters are well drawn, too. Pickens takes a unique, but somewhat questionable on the surface, plot and makes it glow. It's one of her best works (along with A Diamond in the Rough & A Lady of Letters). The spy plot is little more than a device, being "off screen" most of the time, but it is handled deftly. And there were a couple of moments that were slightly discordant after the "revealing" of the truth. Other than those minor nitpicks, this is a grand book, well worth the read. I almost want to pick it back up and read it again.

Witty &amp; warm &amp; thoroughly enjoyable, this novel has wonderful lead characters who sparkle with life and wit. Their playful banter is superb. George is truly a rake with a heart of gold (eventually, anyway), and Olivia is a confirmed spinster who dreams of something more. When George meets Olivia, he never dreams that his dire need for a fortune could turn into a dire need for this woman's love. Indeed, this romance is one of the best out there. Their motives and reservations are very clearly explained to the reader.The only problems I have are:1. Why didn't George try to restore Rye Vale earlier? He's had the title for over a decade! That's never really explained.2. While I have no problems with the lack of a love scene per se (I've read plenty of books without them that I've thoroughly enjoyed, usally more than those that are overly explicit), the allusions are too vague. George &amp; Olivia apparently wait until after the wedding to consummate their relationship, but there is some hanky-panky. The reader, however, can be easily confused as to what exactly that hanky-panky entails because of the way it's written (they're in bed, but nothing happens?). I think I'd have preferred nothing. Something, though, is necessary to heighten the emotional impact of the next group of scenes; I just wish Farr had written it more clearly.Other than those two things, the book was wonderful. I'd have given it 5 stars (and was planning to for much of the book) until those 2 things bugged me. Nevertheless, it's a definite TO READ book.

I picked up this book based a one of Layton's stories in an anthology. I found her writing style intriguing and her plotting interesting. She manages that again in these two books; yet I must disagree with the previous reviewers in some matters.As I read &quot;The Disdainful Marquis&quot; I kept wondering if the heroine could possibly be THAT naive. Honestly. She eventually handled it all with great aplomb, but I'm still skeptical that she could possibly have been so innocent as to get herself in such a fix. On the bright side, the setting (France on the even of Napoleon's return) was riveting, and the jail scene was perhaps the best in the book. The relationship between the hero and heroine was very well done, and I, for one, liked Sinjin (the Marquis) a great deal. His friend and helper was as excellent secondary character. The Duchess and her friends were seedy characters indeed. Although the beginning of the story seemed to drag, the plot really took off when the heroine had to start running.&quot;The Abandoned Bride&quot; presents a wonderful heroine with just the right wistfulness and self-doubt. Nick's wariness and then championing of her seemed to his the right notes, but Robin's character left something to be desired. Actually, I'm not sure of Nick's responses near the end. The second chapter was a thing of beauty, but in general, I thought this the weaker of the two books.In short, both books have things to recommend them, but are not at the top of the list in either characterization or emotional depth. They are mildly entertaining and occasionally exhibit exceptional examples of style. Overall, however, they are middle of the road.

Far too short a run on TV, but at least the DVD is now available with three (count 'em, three) unaired episodes. And they are wonderful, particularly three of them. The last one I watched made me scream that the show had been canceled. And here's a quick prayer for the hoped-for movie.Fans of the show will love this DVD, especially being able to view the shows in the order Whedon would have liked. The behind-the-scenes featurettes really show how much the show meant to the cast and crew. In fact, I'd recommend viewing at least one of those before beginning the series if you're new to Firefly. The gag reel is fun, especially the ending(!).For those new to Firefly, yes, even these few episodes are worth watching. This was a show aired by those who did not understand it, and TV land is sorrier for its loss. The characters and their situations and interactions are engaging. The ensemble cast excels at making the viewer immediately care about these people. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this show; in fact, fans of westerns may like it just as much. Watch at least 2-3 episodes; give yourself a chance to catch on to the show's unique qualities. It's a gem.This may have been my best present this year.

Otherwise, the book was an enjoyable read. But as the misunderstandings continue and the lead couple seem not only unable but unwilling to trust, this reader began to wish for the book to end. And it ended very, very well, It just took too long. It almost seemed that London nearly finished the book, realized it was too short, and picked up another (and ultimately disheartening) series of misunderstandings and distrust. 3.5 stars for wearing me out with the lack of trust and heavy doses of psychology. Otherwise I'd have given it 4 stars. I cried a lot, and I liked it well enough to read the rest of the series.

This is was the primary problem for me. Julian is quite wonderful, but it is primarily his attempts to keep from being hurt by her that cause him to contribute negatively to their relationship. Claudia, however, makes huge mistake after serious erroneous assumption, often dating back to childhood and teenage slights, and repeatedly makes hasty judgments wihtout thinking them through first. These things inevitably lead to her hurting Julian, putting someone else in harm's path, etc. The worst thing is that she never truly learns or admits just how wrong she was. Oh, she does somewhat, but it's never enough to be convincing. Julian, on the other hand, makes this discovery and admission, but he allows Claudia too much credit in his changed perceptions.These neverending problems and misunderstandings drag down an otherwise good book. The look at domestic violence and historical gender inequalities is realistic and eye- and heart-opening (even if you already know the facts). Claudia's youthful insecurities are understandable, but they are taken too far here. There are many good things in this book, and the slightly messy ending of Sophie and the rest is realistic. I wish London had not taken the couple's difficulties so far; they hurt each other so much (especially Claudia hurting Julian), that forgiveness came much too easily and quickly.

It is rare that I do not enjoy a Jo Beverley book, but his is one of her best. I've read the Malloren series totally out of order as I came across the books (someday I'll go back and read them in order), but they've all stood alone as well as fitting into the series.Rosamunde is so sweet, and her reasons for adultery are noble, though she suffers remorse because she enjoyed it and fell in love. Brand is just darling--a kind, gentle, warmhearted man. Rosa and Diana's friendship is terrific, as is the relationship between Brand and Bey (Rothgar). Even more delicious is the early chemistry between Diana and Bey. Go to Jo Beverley's website and read the scenes she pulled from this book because Bey and Diana were taking over.The resolution is not perfect for the characters; the problems were maintained as very real problems, but the ever resouceful Mallorens manage to make the best of it. Heartwarming, heartbreaking, a gem of a romance, told with power, passion, insight, and incredible skill. 4.9 stars

I thought Michael was wonderful. And it was such a a different approach to make the man the one who loved in silence. What a sweet man! Wouldn't any woman want to be loved as he loves Francesca?And Francesca was so fortunate to have loved and been loved twice in her life. Her fears and uncertainties ring true to me. Their relationship is very passionate (on every level).Michael's illness adds another layer of poignancy; I wish, though, that JQ had assured us of a long &amp; happy life for them, rather than her more vague thinking in the author's note. This novel is pure romance, no mysteries or other intrigues to muddle the plot.I enjoyed the book immensely. JQ remains a sure-buy for me.

Even JQ's "lesser" books put most other works in the shade. I'd give this one 4.7 stars.It may not be JQ's wittiest or liveliest or most powerful, but it's fun, diverting, and (I thought) romantic. I felt there was sufficient chemistry between the leads. I liked Gareth a great deal, and Hyacinth was a hoot. She'll definitely be like Lady Danbury when she's that age. Lady D added a lot to the story as well, a good thing since the Bridgertons were mostly absent. I didn't find Anthony's behavior odd; he's responsible for his sister in a way that's much different from his wife (whom he was forced to marry, BTW). And I thought Gregory was merely young, not boring; as he matures, he'll spice up, I'm sure -- at this stage, I envision him pairing up with a hellion.So, even if you think this isn't JQ's best work, it's still a fun, pleasant read and a suitable addition to the Bridgerton series. I recognize, though, that her last book (Gregory's) will have to be top notch to wrap up the series. JQ reamins an automatic buy for me.

I actually enjoyed the romance in this book better then its sequel, The Valentine Wish. However, I probably would have liked the second book better had I read this one first; this first one provides much needed background to the second. Then again, this Emma seems little like the one I remember in the other. Whatever, read this one first.I liked Sarah and Chance very much, and though their romance thoroughly satisfying. The problem was with the mystery involving the missing diamonds: it was too easily solved and really didn't need Sarah's "gifts" at all. I solved it immediately, but it took Chance and Sarah the entire book (and Chance only after Sarah said it). Too obvious, too easy.So don't read it for the mystery, but do enjoy the romance and the intro to these three sisters who play the heroines. To be honest, I'm not looking forward to book 3, bcause I did not like Rachel in this one. We'll see.

I didn't like this one quite as much as Barely a Bride because of the repetition at the beginning regarding the Free Fellows League (needful for the book to stand alone, but annoying to those who have recently read the first) and because of an irritating but thankfully not-too-frequent tendency to repeat information as though the reader cannot remember it. For example, how many times do we really need to be told that Jarrod's ability to gather information is astounding, even to his friends?All that aside, however, Merely a Groom is a delight to read thanks to its lead characters and the rest of the Free Fellows (and gal pals). It's fun to read these books and see the future begin to unfold before you: other Free Fellows with potential ladies mentioned in these books. You'll like them all.This book does not keep the reader's interest quite as well as the first, hence the small drop in rating. But Collin is a sweet and sensitive man that no woman in her right mind could avoid falling in love with. Gillian is a woman who truly appreciates this wonderful man and the second chance at love she has been given. They are so obviously good for each other that the heart warms reading about them.I can't wait for the next installment.

Only slight imperfections, a somewhat slow beginning, & emotional power that isn't quite as compelling as some others keep this book from receiving 5 stars.Tayg is a fine hero, a charmer uncertain how to step into his deceased brother's shoes and unwilling to be forced into marriage by his parents. Cat is not quite the shrew indicated -- don't expect a remake of Shakespeare here. But she does use shrewishness as a defense against what she has come to expect of men, thanks to her brothers & father. Tayg's kindness and sincere compliments allow glimpses of the softer woman beneath the armour.One the plot starts moving, the pace is good, keeping the reader interested in the book. The truths behind Cat's eldest brother's machinations is handly extremely well. And the ending is quite satisfying and heartwarming.Most enjoyable, and I look forward to more from this author.

As a reader, you really don't know whether to root for Miranda and Alex or slap them upside the head. The situation Maxwell has created is unusual, but it's never fully engaging. The reader always remains outside the action, never committed emotionally. One does feel sorry for the duke most of the time (until the end), but from the preview, he'll get his comeuppance in splendid fashion.Maxwell can be amazingly good or astoundingly mediocre. This effort falls into the latter category. It has moments, but it's thin emotionally, and the lead characters never captured this reader's heart. The interesting situation and plot do not make up for the wishy-washy selfishness, pride, and wrongheadedness of the leads. Although I didn't really care much for sister Charlotte in this book, she must improve as she's the heroine next time out.If you intend to read the rest of the series, reading this one first will be vital to understanding all that takes place later on. Just don't expect it to be a great read; borrow it from the library or a friend. 2.8 stars.

Well, I for one really enjoyed Bevarly's wacky humor in this book. (It's my first time reading her work.) The repetitions were intended as humor, and I found them funny. In fact, only the first one, which was used more often, got old. Yes, many of the sentences start with "and," "but," etc. People do not think in complete sentences, and much of what is written is the workings of the minds of one of the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed both romances in this book; the characters were very well developed, and their relationships were emotionally compelling, romantic, and steamy.The suspense could have been equally good, and I thought Bevarly would tie everything together at the end. Unfortunately, she did not. The two romances barely tied together, and the spy plot was left dangling with no resolution. That was bad, very bad. She could so easily have connected the spy plot to Pax's computer business and tied everything together. Alas!So, great on romance, and I thought it was very funny, but the lack of resolution in the spy sub-plot and the failure to tie the two romances together loses some points. Come to think of it, Bevarly doesn't really put the finishing touches on the second roance either. I've set the stars at 4 because the rating could use the boost, but it's really about a 3 to 3.5.

All Through the Night is an engrossing read. Jack is a compelling hero: dark, dangerous, deadly, and a perfect gentleman. Anne is a tortured heroine: smart, lovely, guilt-ridden, and hiding a shocking alter-ego. Jack is wonderful in his early openly admitted need for her. Anne, knowing more than he does, is more reticent. In fact, she eventually hurts him on purpose to push him away. In fear and anger, they each resort to using sex as a weapon--one of the dark portions of this book--but in the end, they come to terms with the dangerous, dark world of their pasts and leave it behind for a new world of light and love.Brockway's writing is at times poetic as she decribes scenes and characters, particularly where Jack is concerned. The shadows of London are superbly portrayed and offer an interesting juxtaposition to the glowing entertainments of the ton. Exceptionally well-written.

I've really enjoyed this mystery series; this book adds several more layers to Harris' unique world. If you're really into the Sookie relationship thing, you may be disappointed here. Yes, there are several contenders, but they come across as "man of the moment" cut-outs. I'm a reader who found her libido to be a little overactive in this story--not as bad as the guys, mind you, but it just didn't mesh with the rest of her characterization. There was also, for me, a huge let-down regarding one of the main men in her life (not Eric or Bill); thinking back on the last book, I suppose it was coming, but it didn't still sit well with me. There's also a sense that almost every guy she mmets (who's not from her hometown) has the hots for her. Jeez.You really feel sorry for Sookie in this book, poor thing. Last year her grandmother died; this year.... Well, she goes through the wringer in this one. There were also some superior moments of humor and a very fine mystery. Unfortunately, there were too many loose ends at the book's finish; it almost seemed that a larger book had been sliced in half. Maybe that'll mean a quick publishing date for the next installment? Still, a page-turning read.

Written in first person, Joy's thoughts, as well as her speech, are often hilarious. The story is very sexy and fun. It's lighthearted and sometimes silly, but that's okay from time to time. I had my doubts because I couldn't stand MacAlister's Noble books, but I found this one quite amusing.On the down side, Joy and Roxy are supposed to be best friends, but they are very catty toward each other. I have to wonder who wants friendships like that! So there were definitely times I was annoyed by the book, too, including times when Joy would do something stupid or something she had sworn not to do. She does talk too much, but then there are people who do.There was some guessing about who was who and who were the good guys and villains right up to the end of the book. But Roxy, in particular, was annoying. Overall, though, it was an amusing read, although I probably won't buy it.

Vorador is a terrific hero: a handsome, slightly arrogant, powerful wizard with a good sense of humor. Petra has no magic--not a single drop--a rare condition that results in her accidentally playing havoc with Seattle's most powerful wizard's spells. In addition, Petra's outspoken &quot;curses&quot; wreck havoc with Vorador's affinity with fire. The result of these two facts is some highly amusing moments (the fighting action figures and &quot;Great balls of fire!&quot;)The murder mystery is well-plotted and moves at a good pace. The only drawback there is the villain's stereotypical tell-all explanation when victory seems imminent.The romance is witty and interesting if not as emotionally deep as one might hope. Sparks fly fast &amp; furious, but our couple keeps getting interrupted--a situation that no doubt annoys them more than it might the reader.This book missed 4 stars primarily because some things are never explained, like Vorador &amp; Petra's almost uncontrollable lust, or are not weighty enough to support the necessary emotional turmoil, such as Vorador's need to protect his clients.Not a perfect book, but a very enjoyable one.

While I really enjoyed Laurey's previous books in this series, this one left me wanting. The thriller/suspense plot retains reader interest and is certainly complicated. However, it's not very deep (or original). The villain is a truly nasty piece of work (though stereotypical despite being a vampire), yet he is easily dispatched in the end. Not well done.Worse, there is little romance in this paranormal romance. Angela & Tom argue, but there is no other tension between them. The love scenes are without true passion. In fact, there's little deep emotion (other than fear) for either character. The most emotional scene in the book involves Justin, Stella, and Sam.This one is a real let down after the other two. Read it if you want to go on with the series (and I definitely advise the others first), but I don't recommend buying it.

Cedric's eccentric family is really at the heart of this story, and they're a terrific bunch of characters. Cedric is a fine leading man--humorous, attractive, caring, if not particularly exciting. He's just a good man. Emma starts out very stiff and dour as she tries to be wholly unremarkable. But Cedric sees past that facade. In fairly short order, Emma comes to care about the eccentrics who surround her. We don't get to see enough of this change, however. In fact, she almost loses Cedric because of her stubbornness.The really annoying thing about the book, which was perhaps explained in the first title, A Christmas wish, which I have not read, is why Emma is not received in society but her sisters are. If the sole rationale for Emma is her highwayman father, then it should apply to the other two ladies as well. This so irritated me that my true rating is 2 & 1/2 stars, when it might otherwise be three.

I really did not expect to like Rachel at all, but Raleigh delves below the surface to present a woman the reader can like. She's not quite as self-centered and vain as she appeared in the other books. Anthony is a very nice hero who knows exactly how to handle her. The secondary romance was a little awkward for me. The story of the Devilish Dandy and all three Cresswell sisters is nicely wrapped up, giving the trilogy a sense of completion.Raleigh does sometimes wreak havoc with the English language, her characters are not the most inspired, nor her plots the the most engrossing. Neither is her emotional content anywhere near the level of, say, Mary Balogh. But Raleigh can spin an enjoyable yarn, and this book is just right for a few hours of light reading.

I really wanted to like this book more than I did. But, the hero is a rogue of the worst kind for some time, the heroine is both too good to be true and too naive, historical innacuracies pull the reader out of the story, and King's style can become too sentimental and repetitious.King's style tries to be reminiscent of Jane Austen, but often feels forced and sounds trite. Plot elements often fail to become fully realized, especially as to their effects. A smile and a smoothly delivered line cannot end all potential scandal. King does, however, have a good handle on the seesaw type of relationship that permeates romance books. The too pat, but still entertaining fates of the heroine's sisters are also noteworthy. The villain was adroitly handled, and this heroine is one who can certainly stand on her own.Great potential in this book; I just wish it had been executed with greater care. Enjoyable, but hardly exceptional.

Both of the other reviewers made excellent points. In fact, I enjoyed the interplay between the main characters so much (in spite of the mounds of historical inaccuracies) that I almost rated the book higher. Attention to history and social mores of the day and to tight plotting and improved style could easily move King into higher rankings.Relationship-wise, the book was a pleasure to read. Even knowing the outcome of sub-plots in advance failed to detract from the excellent couple. However, the previous viewer is quite correct in the book's most damning flaw: marriageable-age single men and women would NEVER have been allowed to be alone together as depicted in this book. Her reputation would have been ruined and/or he would have been forced to marry her. Worse, other couples were daily in the same situations. Daily carriage travel and all the other complaints of that reviewer are also too true. In addition, the brother's dastardly turn is not given enough base to be truly creditable and the secondary characters could be better developed. For example, the Colonel is the hero's good friend, but you'd never know it if the author hadn't said so. Many things happen only to advance the plot, without really springing from the characters or previous actions. Finally, King repeats too many pet phrases, eventually causing the reader to nearly groan at their use (&quot;tumble in love&quot; being a prime example).Having said all that, however, I enjoyed the central couple enough that I was able to return to the story every time my disbelief refused to be suspended. The central idea of the book and the general plot used to bring the couple together were fresh and interesting. Better execution, especially regarding historical accuracy, could have made this a fine book indeed.

Although the Christmas theme is a minor element, Christmas Angel is a warm and wonderful book. It is much lighter than the others in the series: no truly dangerous villain, no manic life-or-death scenarios, no excruciating personal trials. Instead, this is a gentle tale of two people coming to terms with their own views about love and marriage and family. There is some danger and mystery, but it is minor compared to most of Beverley's stories.Judith is a wise, but not worldly, widow who has a wealth of inner strength. She is a great, though somewhat overprotective, mother of two, who marries the younger Leander to provide for them (and herself). Along the way, however, Judith discovers that she has achieved a great deal more. A very real, down-to-earth heroine.Leander is a dream of a hero: witty, urbane, kind, elegant, wealthy, and handsome, but underneath that cool, diplomatic self-control is a great need that he himself cannot define. Judith and his ready-made family quickly fill the void in his life. Leander is, in many ways, just an ordinary guy; although he has issues to deal with, he is not as tortured or volatile as most heroes. He's so very pleasant, too, that he comes across as the sort of man you really could spend a lifetime with.So far, this may well be my favorite of the Company of Rogue series (and the Georges), although I am eagerly awaiting the book about the Rogue who most intrigues me, the quiet Stephen Ball. Until then, enjoy this excellent entry.

but the book itself kept getting in the way. The plot did recover the same ground over and over, and both the hero and the heroine were not particularly sympathetic. Both were stubborn in the most stupid ways, but Madeline is slightly more sympathetic, but she is also almost unbelieveably gullible regarding her first husband.Yes, the love scenes &quot;sizzle,&quot; but too often they seem to be stuck into the book either for their own sake (rather than for any dramatic development) or to pad the word count. In addition, they often seemed somewhat sordid, with Maddie's &quot;mistress&quot; wager &amp; marital fears a flimsy excuse for her behavior.Perhaps it's nitpicky, but it annoyed me to no end: Ms. Bradley cannot seem to master correct pronoun usage. It would not have been so bad if she hadn't done it so often, in such a short span of pages. Hint for Ms. Bradely (and anyone else who needs it): if you're not sure whether to use &quot;he&quot; or &quot;him&quot; (for example) as in &quot;The man offered Jane and him some advice,&quot; leave out the other person and use only the pronoun in question (Would you really say, &quot;The man offered he some advice&quot;?). A small matter, but it ripped me out of the story every time.Sigh. What to rate this book? It had its good points, though I'm having trouble remembering them at the moment.....I suppose 2 &amp; 1/2 stars, though I'm not prepared to go up to 3.

This is a keeper. Gracie has written a delightful romance with engaging characters, a strong plot, and a heartfelt romance. Prudence is a great heroine, caring and kind, resilient and loyal (even to a fault). How wonderful that Gideon immediately saw her for the incredible woman she is. Gideon is delightful; he has such a wonderful sense of humor. I adored him! Their life together will be full of love and laughter. This is one of those books where you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that "happily ever after" is assured. Simply marvelous.Only a few declarations that sound trite or overused and a less than satisfying rationale for Prudence's great-uncle to have left them with her grandfather mar this story. And they are minor complaints compared to the joy of reading the book. For those who like lots of love scenes, be forewarned, that there are only one (one cut short) and they are at the end of the book. Nothing in the romance is lacking, however. This book is about love (in various forms, including sisters) and is really beautifully done.

I actually picked up the second book first, not realizing it was a series. I liked that one very muxh, but I loved this one. I might have said the same about the other had I read it second. It's a fine read without being read in sequence, but the literary quotes were more obtrusive in the second.In this book, however, they flow easily and are always "spot on." Grace and Peter are wonderful characters; in this one you really get inside their heads, and yet Peter remains rather mysterious. The attraction between them is much more obvious here.The mystery is delightful with just the right twists and turns, and Killian's writing is superb. Chapter 1 opens, for example, with an idyllic scene featuring a lovely chattering brook -- and a dead body. Delicious! and vastly entertaining. Killian has a wry way of turning a phrase.The pace is lively, and the story never flags. Add in such captivating characters, and this is a book to be REread -- and I don't often do that. Definitely a keeper!! I just wish I had about 50 more like it.

heroine, not to mention the historical gaffes and plot holes.It took me a long time to like the Major; what he did to his wife was reprehensible. She had every right to be as angry as she was at the beginning of the book.As to historical errors, locate the review that mentions them but gives the book 3 stars. My biggest complaint was: how the heroine was supposed to recover socially even though the hero remarries her? Divorce in that day was the end for a woman; polite society would never again welcome her.The &quot;crippled&quot; war veteran is a nice character touch when so many heroes are physical perfection. Some of the servants are interesting characters. The book's early villain never reappears, and the secondary plot is very weak, serving only to get the hero to the heroine's location and to bring about the climactic scene.Pickens' skill as a writer still allows the reader to enjoy the book despite its flaws (and her tendency to make the names confusing), but it's not one of her best.

These two novellas couldn't be any different.Cathy Maxwell's story is rather dull and, worse, silly. I've read better fan fiction -- much better, and lots of of it. This is so far below Cathy Maxwell's best; it's not even mediocre--it's amateurish. At the risk of sounding like Simon Cowell, it was abysmal. The hero's disguise is no disguise at all; the heroine acts like a teenager; and the ending is ridiculous beyond belief.Liz Carlyle's offering, on the other hand, is a delight in every way. She starts with one of the most beautifully written descriptions I have had the pleasure of reading in a very long time. Her hero evokes images of the best in Georgette Heyer's &quot;These Old Shades&quot; while incorporating some of the best of modern romantic heroes. I like him very, very much! Elise, is understandably drawn to him at once--until she learns his name; then his reputation causes her to keep her distance, or try to. My only reason for cutting 1/2 a star is that I think Elise could be a stronger, more individual character. She's good; she just doesn't quite jump off the page and into your heart the way the hero does. Christian (Grayston) really dominates this beautifully written tale.This book is worth buying for Carlyle's novella alone. It is nearly everything that makes a romance a thing a beauty.

White Mist is a warm, engrossing read with strong characters and an enchanting setting. The Isle of Trelay is almost a character itself; Reding does a remarkable job of bringing the place to life. No wonder Eleanor falls in love with the place.There's just enough tension in the mystery, and it is nice to not have the romantic leads antagonistic towards each other. Eleanor's innocence is of the charming variety and is tempered by a kind heart and a good deal of wisdom and bravery for one so young. Gabriel is a good, noble, simple man faced with a centuries-old burden he hates having to bear. Eleanor shows him how to drop that burden and live as he longs to, while his island provides her with a place to belong and be needed.Although the device of Julianna's friend being able to read her mind is too convenient, Gabriel's daughter herself plays a pivotal role. Her silence is well-grounded and effectively utilized. Leftover questions from book 3 are answered, effectively wrapping up the quartet.One thing that really bugs me about Reding's book (and came to a head in this one): both she and her editor need to better understand the structure and usage of the English language. She repeatedly misuses words and parts of speech (For example, using &quot;effects&quot; instead of &quot;affects&quot; and repeatedly using adverbs when adjectives are needed--just because the word is in the predicate doesn't mean it's an adverb.) Sometimes her phrasings are convoluted, too. I enjoyed the story & the characters, but her style and grammar need improvement.

In the previous books, you so wanted to like Alec -- charming, witty, droll, just a hint of vulnerability -- but so many problems and so any bad choices, plus a gambling addiction and using other people, especially women. Foley masterfully brings Alec from a charming but emotionally dangerous ne'er-do-well to an out-and-out hero in every way. Becky's innocence, goodness, honesty, strength, and love give Alec the safety net he needs to confront his past, his addiction, his hurts, and his fears. Because she also needs his help, he vows to be worthy of her trust, to take the opportunity to discover the person he should have been, and becomes a changed man. Becky is very mature and responsible for 20 and makes Alec believe in the reality of love.The secondary characters, especially the villain, were thoroughly rendered into distinct individuals. The tension of hiding from the villain and the dangers surrounding him and of the big whist game is suitably taut. Although there are a few places where the writing seems more like filler (such as the play by play description of the whist game), most of the book retains the reader's interest quite well and moves along at a brisk pace. This is a lovely--and very steamy--romance about the redeeming power of love.

The delicious Grant Morgan must solve the attempted murder of a courtesan -- or is she? Vivian has lost her memory, and she seems too innocent to be the courtesan Grant knows her to be. As he seeks to protect her and find the would-be killer, Grant begins to fall in love with her despite what she is.This book has more of a mystery than the other two books in the series (this is the first). It also introduces us to Ross Cannon, the hero of book 2. This romance is particularly interesting because of the amnesia and Vivian's supposed career. She can't quite believe that she is who he says she is either. Despite all the uncertainites, they begin to fall in love. Vivian is sweet &amp; very likeable, and she and Grant are wonderful together.Kleypas does her usual remarkable job with steamy love scenes, tender emotions, doubts &amp; conflicts, easy-to-read style, and the ultimate triumph of love. Enjoy.

Borrow it from the library; do not buy it. I was so glad that Julia Quinn's story came last, it saved the book. Lisa Kleypas' story was a big disappointment; Jake Linley deserved better, and the whole thing seemed silly. I don't think Kelypas' heart was in it.I haven't read any of Kinley MacGregor's books (though I've read some of her books as Sherrilyn Kenyon to mixed reviews), so I can't compare this story. Honestly, I liked it better than Kleypas' story, which was a surprise; I think I liked the hero and heroine better than with Kleypas, and I was so prepared to love Jake.While Julia Quinn has written better stories, hers is by far the best of this trio. Her trademark humor abounds, and both Ned and Charlotte are delightful characters. Their chemistry leaps off the page, even in such a short tale. If someday, this story is published in a different group (with other stories equal in quality), I'd buy it.Or I might buy this book for a dollar at my local library sale. But Julia Quinn's story is the only one worth having and rereading. It is thanks to her that the book gets its 2 stars, cause her entry is worth much more.

For the first 2/3 of the book, this was one of the most delightful books I've ever read -- thoroughly enchanting. I, for one, was always intrigued by Ethan and looked forward to his story. He is marvelous here -- such wit and tenderness, and self-doubt, and strength, beneath all that charm and insouciance. And Jane -- she was sheer delight from her first moment on the page. Their banter and chemistry was top-notch. I smiled through much of the first half of the book. A very solid 5 stars.Suddenly, however, about 2/3 of the way through the book, Jane unveils her secret. This reader, at least, was unprepared. Looking back, there were some hints, but very, very vague and inconsequential. In fact, at times in the last third of the book, Jane almost seems a different person (like the scene where she seduces Ethan, the ramifications of which BTW were never resolved to my satisfaction). The jar felt here drastically cut my enjoyment of the book. Perhaps this is a case where the character simply pounced on the author late in the book and announced her "truth," demanding her way; it happens. Unfortunately, the author doesn't seem to have gone back and made sure it was all of a piece from beginning to end. Once the bad guys re-enter the picture, the story picks up and once again becomes familiar. Thus, the book is rescued. A twinge of annoyance remains, however, because I felt tricked by the twist.I found the ending tied the book into both the Liars and the Royal Four series quite well. Be aware that the ending is one of those "Oh, please, don't make me wait for the next book; I'll go mad" sort of cliffhangers. Not regarding our romantic leads, but regarding the entire Liars/Royal Four spy world.

Love it or hate it? I mostly loved it. Yes, there were times that the sex jokes got stale and occasions when the timing was questionable...but they never detracted from the story for me. Moreover, the characterizations and back stories so enchanted me that I couldn't care less about any minor faults. Indeed, this book isn't really about sexual seduction, as some reviewers seem to think. It's about the seduction of the heart -- a vastly different, and more noble, thing altogether.Lucien is a very complex character, contrary to first impressions. In fact, Elizabeth, once she's around him on a regular basis, quickly begins to see through his masks. Elizabeth is a very strong heroine who has had to hold her head up high throughout her life due to circumstances beyond her control; yet she makes every effort to control their effects on her. Until Lucien unwittingly causes it all to crumble around her. Truly, she is the stronger member of this couple, but she teaches him a great deal about strength of character. For deep down inside, it is only guilt that keeps him from being the marvelous man his tenants adore. How each of them come to see the inner person -- and themselves -- especially Lucien's growth as a person -- is the heart of this book.The humor runs from bawdy to satirical and caused me to laugh out loud on several occasions. Before the book's end, however, I often had to fight to read the page through tear-blurred eyes. The emotional anguish is on the money, and is the pin on which the whole book turns. It is marvelously done. The last three chapters (not the epilogue) are some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever read; beautifully done.Perhaps not quite 5 stars, but certainly more than 4... at the end, I didn't care about lack of perfection; I was too caught up in the story, the characters, and the how-on-earth-can-it-possibly-have-a-happy-ending tension. A thoroughly satisfying read!

Although there were a few minor irritations, they had more to do with leftovers from The Charmer than with this book. So without that, I have to give this book 4 & 1/2 - 5 stars. I have long waited for Lord Reardon's story, and I was not disappointed -- a fact for which I am exceedingly glad after the low point of The Charmer.Reardon (Nathaniel) and Willa are terrific individually and awesome together. The way their relationship started had me wondering, but Bradley pulled it out beautifully. Wit, plenty of emotion, exquisite romance, very sensual love scenes, and thrilling intrigue combine to make this book a splendid way to continue the characters and world begun with the Liars Club series and to initiate the Royal Four series. I am thrilled that Ethan Damont (the best character from The Charmer) is up in the next book.So glad I bought this book. Happy reader, here.

Her very short story was not worth the time to read it. Flimsy, contrived, and boring, without interesting characters or a well-defined setting. Perhaps those who have read whatever book these characters come from would appreciate it, but I can't imagine anyone else doing so.Anderson's Old West story was somewhat contrived, but humorous and engaging. It made a nice change of pace for me; I rather enjoyed it. The title's a mystery.Kleypas' story was not her best effort and featured a rather dull hero and an irritating heroine, but the tale was mildly entertaining.The real treat in this set of short stories was Chase's tale of the mad earl. It was populated with vivid characters, realistic settings, a tightly woven plot, and emotional range. Read this book if you read it for this story alone. I'll be finding more by Loretta Chase thanks to this story.

The early 20th century is an unusual period for historical romances, so Feather's setting is both interesting and somehow odd. I like it; I'm just not used to it, and I have little background knowledge upon which to evaluate it. Nevertheless, I look forward to more books written in the period.Although this is the second book in the series, I read it first because I had run out of reading material and it was the only thing of interest in the airport bookstore. I found it engaging. Prudence Duncan is certainly an unconventional woman, and I have to wonder how far she ventures from the accepted mores of the day. Her intelligence and wit are just the thing to balance the agressive arrogance of barrister Gideon Malvern, who also happens to be a gourmet chef and a single father. There are few indications as to how Prudence will take to being an instant (step-)mother.Feather manages to keep the romance at the forefront while sifting through the twists and turns of a libel case against the paper that Prudence and her sisters publish. One has to wonder, though, what Malvern the barrister would think of their unethical business practices.The book is good, but not on my list of favorites.

The Bride Finder left me stunned, it was so good. The second in the series, The Night Drifter, isn't quite as good (hence 4 instead of 5 stars, though 4 & 1/2 would be more accurate) but is still far above most books in the genre and well worth the reading.Lance is a great hero, even though I never understood why his particular gift is supposed to be so amazing amongst so many amazing gifts. Other reviewers have expressed their disappointment in Rosalind; I can barely remember her, which indicates to me that wasn't particularly memorable. When we first meet her, she seems like a delightful heroine, but later her continued infatuation with a ghost despite the presence of a living, breathing hero does get a little annoying.Propero is a welcome secondary character, as always, but Ellie is a poor Bride Finder compared to the wonderful one in the first book. Unfortunately, she's young enough to stick around for a while. I miss the old man.Defintely read this one, even though opinions are divided on how it comes to The Bride Finder. Susan Carroll is simply a fabulous author.

This is my second book by Jordan, but I'm not very impressed. Oh, it certainly had its moments, but despite some really emotional inner struggles, the book as a whole didn't often move me, although I liked it better than the other one.The love scenes too seldom move the plot forward in any significant manner, and they often skirt the border of what's acceptable for me personally. The middle of the book were terribly slow, and while I rather liked Kell, I wasn't too fond of Raven. Most of the secondary characters and the plot points were weak, tired, or overused.All in all, I think I'm done with Nicole Jordan for a while. It just wasn't worth my time (except perhaps as an exercise in what I don't like).

McCabe does a very credible job of presenting an "opposites attract" romance that's just a tiny bit different. Lord Morley isn't as bad as he seems to Rosalind at first, but he's definitely opposed to her rigid rules of behavior. Rosalind is far too prim, failing to grasp the joy of life; Morley shows her how to loosen up and have some fun. But it all happens through a series of unfortunate events--events unwittingly caused by the other. Each character is well-developed and grows through the course of the book. There are no dastardly villains, just the usual differences in personality and human mistakes evident in real life. So while there's no urgent drama, the more realistic approach to this relationship is both welcome and soothing.A charming romance.

Charlotte is a very interesting heroine: intelligent, strong, principled, and exceptionally proper because of past hurt. Her responses to Wynter's high-handedness and loveless &quot;care&quot; are heart-wrenching. Her only real flaw is that she ventually loves him for some unfathomable reason, so the book says, although there is little evidence of it. She also sometimes seems to act out of character with the children in her role as governness.Wynter, however, is an a_s. He's an arrogant, chauvinistic jerk who believes men rightly rule the world and women are little better than possessions. His end-of-book declaration of love is too little, too late, especially considering that his behavior does not change. It's as though he says the words to appease her and so get what he wants. Too much time is spent on his outrageousness and too little on his redemption. It's totally unbelieveable. I hated him.The secondary characters are caricatures or shadow-people with little substance. The &quot;ghost&quot; is too obvious. There are too many flaws here to even decide which to mention. The only things that makes this book at all worth reading is the intro to the series and Charlotte.Get it from the library; don't bother buying it. I'm selling my copy.

Read out of order, but it's one of my favorites in the series.Devon is so full of himself, so conceited, so vain....it's both exasperating and amusing. When he's considering all the reasons Pamela ought to marry him, he happens to catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror and adds, "Handsome. Dashing." to his mental list. He's right, but he knows it in the most concetied way. He was not, however, raised that way as we see from his wonderful grandfather. So, over the course of the book, Devon's eyes are opened about the state of his heart and he matures greatly.He and Pamela suffer from the same emotional turmoil: an inability to trust in the fidelity of the opposite sex because of the actions of a parent. This, more than his conceit, is the obstacle they must overcome.We see multiple aspects of Pamela's personality: the warm, idealistic young woman who loves children and just wants peace & security, the no-nonsense governness who is prim and proper and completely willing to look down her nose at her unfeeling employer, and the woman of passion who loves despite the walls she has built around her heart. Pamela is freed more than she grows as a person. And her character and kindness help guide Devon's reformation.Beth is a delightful child, though she sometimes seems old for her age. I would like to have seen more of why Devon's best friend was his best friend. I thought the counterfeiting mystery could have had more depth. Motivations could have been stronger, and the characters involved could have been better defined.But the romance is marvelous, and as several reviewers have noted, hot. An excellent book, rated down from 5 stars only for the superficiality of the counterfeiting plot.

This was my first Christina Dodd book. I chose one of her books based on other recommendations, especially one my one of my favorite authors. However, I was not particularly enchanted with this book; for me, it was mediocre. I liked the heroine, even though she seemed a tad weak-willed with regard to the hero. But the hero was not very likeable until near the middle of the book; in fact, he was often quite cruel verbally and emotionally. Even now, I'm not sure I'm entirely convinced of their love for each other (lust, yes; but love....).Dodd did an excellent job of keeping the reader in suspense about whom to trust and who's a villain. Unfortunately, one often wondered that about the hero. The book's style was interesting, and I will read another Christina Dodd, give her another chance. But this one isn't among the best I've read; I had little trouble putting it down.

Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read.

Althought her secondary characters are rather like cardboard cutouts, the lead couple, especially Lucy, are well-rounded. Lucy is delightful: ambitious, principled, and very likeable. Henry is typical alpha aristocrat who thinks love and emotional entanglements are weak, but his beliefs are based on distorted memories of his parents. Becasue of his erroneous beliefs, Henry is thoroughly attracted to Lucy but is intent upon marrying for "practical" reasons. Therefore, Henry is not always likeable, but he learns in time. At least he's honest with Lucy up front and shows signs, even early, of not really being the a** he sometimes appears. This dichotomy in his character is one of his strongest attributes.There are a few things that seen anachronistic, but overall this is a very good debut novel. Cook shows a great deal of promise.

Despite sudden shows of strength and character at the end, both lead characters were weak and cowed by their parents. Philip could not have had any honor as a gentleman to leave Isabella as he had. She is a seriously permissive maternal figure and a spoiled brat who often cannot understand anything outside her own desires. The two-year-old boy is not just precocious; he's completely unbelieveable. A number of characters are unlikeable (and I don't think they are supposed to be), and the author often makes details about them or the plot confusing or contradictory. There are also a number of highly questionable (if not outright erroneous) historical details. I could barely make myself finish it.Don't bother.

In this book, that's a good thing. Helena is crippled after suffering from polio, but Daniel thinks she's wonderful even if she's far too fine for the likes of him. Daniel's past catches up with him with he has to help Helena find her younger sister. During the search they realize that their imperfections of body and background mean nothing in the face of true love.An excellent sequel to A Dangerous Love.

Part of the book's problem was its unevenness. Sometimes it really held my interest and other times I just wanted to be finished with it. I like Marcus a lot (a lot, alot), but Mary doesn't impress me much. In fact, I found her annoying. Somehow, though, I cannot see this woman who so loved the sea and wilds of Cornwall, hating to leave that behind, happy to follow Marcus to the dry deserts of Egypt.The letters from the sister that opened each chapter were a very nice touch, adding to the reader's understadning, providing foreshadowing, and making the sister an active character in the story. The who-done-it is also well executed, as are the love scenes.All in all, it's okay and has its good moments, but it's not great -- and definitely not perfect.

Gavin is an interesting hero: he can be warm and witty or arrogant and self-deluded. He's smart and responsible, but too easily (mis)led by the family &quot;curse&quot; and too readily believes love to be mere lust. In fact, nearly everyone wonders if he has a heart. He's flawed, just like real people. He really battles with his feelings for her, often rationalizing his actions, some of which really are not nice.Kira is a noble, graceful, and open-hearted woman, who is perhaps too naive and too willing to endure insults based on her mixed heritage. It is her loving nature that eventually cracks open Gavin's heart. But she does from time to time stand up for herself, eventually refusing to allow others to think poorly of her and refusing to think so of herself.The story remains interesting throughtout, the characters are thoroughly developed, and the multilayered plot is finely drawn. The reader is also treated to a renewal of acquaintance with Brock and Maddie from Strictly Seduction (which I didn't like as well as this one), who actually fare almost better in this story. The love scenes here, indeed the entire romance, are much better, and more genuine, more loving.

This may be my least favorite Balogh novel. Although I appreciate the fact that both lead characters are flawed people, Balogh makes too much of it -- so much that I never believe they really love each other, and there is certainly no assurance that their marriage will succeed. It's realistic, yes, but I do not read any book in any genre for realism. Moreover, there was little here that really touched my heart, and that's one of the things that I particularly like about Balogh's work -- she knows how to push those emotional buttons.Balogh does write well, providing descriptions of people & events that the reader can buy into. And I did read the whole thing, having to know how things ended. But I was left unsatisfied with the bittersweet and uncertain result. Their constant feuding became tiresome, and there was too much narration for my taste. The Mr. Collins-like character was too much like Mr. Collins -- exasperatingly amusing, yes, too felt like the rip-off it was. But the big thing for me was the lack of joy and hope in the relationship. And the resolution of their long hatred for each other was too easily executed. Moira didn't NOT believe Kenneth for a moment -- after all the times she suspected him of the worst? It didn't ring true.

I was really geared up for a new novel from Lisa Kleypas,a dn the idea of the Wallflower series was good. Unfortunately the execution so far isn't up to Kleypas' usual standard.Annabelle is a difficult heroine to like--she's a snob and somewhat unethical, willing to do almost anything to snare a rich husband. Simon is okay, but not the dreamy heroes Kleypas usually conjurs up.Kleypas is usually steamy, but the love scenes here seemed forced. Worse, the entire books is shallow, superficial, much like the heroine. It's slow and makes for a long read. A real disappointment. In fact, as I've written this review, I've lowered the rating. It's only 2 & 1/2 and comparing it to some many other, better works, I'm downgrading it from a 3 to a 2.

Brandon is an angry, selfish, almost abusive man for much of the book. Heather is not just naive, she's cowardly and foolish. By the end of the book, I liked them okay, but it took a very long time, and they'll never be anything close to my favorite characters.The multiple rapes at the beginning of the book just got the whole thing off on the wrong foot. Even 2/3 of the way through the book, Brandon had few qualms about possibly repeating the act. And Heather, by the time the villain showed up, should have trusted Brandon to protect, but oh, no. And the reader is never convinved of her reasoning.The book is too long, the dialogue often ridiculously flowery, and the exposition generally a drag on the movement of the plot. In a way, I'd like to read the sequel, That Elusive Flame, but I'm not sure I can handle it. This book has its moments, but I find the writing to be very uneven. It's just not for me.

Julia Quinn drew me to this book, but I was more than pleased with each of the four novellas included. Unlike most anthologies, the quality was top-notch all the way through, even though each story had its own strengths.My first experience with the other authors was pleasant enough to have me looking for their books for my to-be-read pile. Having Quinn's Lady Whistledown weave the stories together is an added delight. Moreover, the stories do mesh quite well, with characters from each of the novellas making appearances in the other three.While Suzanne Enoch's &quot;One True Love&quot; is a charming romance, well-written and enjoyable, I found it to be the weakest of the four offerings. The quality of all the works, however, means that even the weakest link is remarkably good. My only real criticism is that the story didn't stay with me once I moved on to the next one; thus, it simply wasn't as memorable as the others. Nevertheless, Lady Anne Bishop and the Marquis of Halfurst are a well-matched pair and it was great fun watching the Marquis claim his errant fianc&eacute;. His romantic gesture with the daffodils was really well cone, although the proposal left me a little flat.&quot;Two Hearts&quot; by Karen Hawkins pits the boldly delightful spinster Elizabeth Pritchard against her lifelong friend, the roguish Royce Pemberley. What a delight to watch Elizabeth realize that at 31, she does want a husband to share her life and love with; even more delightful is watching Royce realize that his old chum is a desirable woman and he may very well lose her. Their confusion and consternation over the changing nature of their relationship is almost palpable, and Liza's bovine-loving suitor is a gem of the eye-rolling variety. Royce's declaration, in front of other no less, is possibly the most romantic in the book; it has the same joyous tears of Emma Thompson's performance in Sense &amp; Sensibility.Mia Ryan's &quot;A Dozen Kisses&quot; had me laughing out loud as Lady Caroline Starling said all sorts of things that never should have left her lips and the Marquis of Darington constantly said things less than what he meant. His difficulty in saying what he means after a war injury was handled beautifully, lending him both gentle sympathy and personal courage. Although his friend was somewhat sketchily drawn, Caroline's mother was well done (the hateful woman). At times, the story sags just a touch when it becomes more serious, but when Dare finally writes to her all that he cannot manage to speak ... ahhhhh..... And Caroline's impetuousness always hits the right notes.There's a reason Julia Quinn is my favorite romance author--she never misses. &quot;Thirty-six Valentines&quot; contains both the sly wit and the emotional depth that always sets Quinn's work apart. When Susannah Ballister is dumped by her suitor who would expect his older brother to sweep her off her feet? A single kindness, one that reestablishes her in society, sets the stage for romance. In the process, Susannah and David, the Earl of Renminster, both learn a great deal about themselves, and Susannah sees in David what no one else, even his brother, has discovered. As for the 36 Valentines...well, we wouldn't want to spoil the story.This is a buyer and a keeper. The best anthology it has ever been my pleasure to read.

I had not even finished watching this movie in the theatre (the first time) before I knew I'd be buying the DVD. Depp is brilliant, Bloom is engagingly earnest, Knightley is the perfect heroine, and Rush the quintessential villain. Plenty of both laughs and action, with just the right amount of romance.DVD has some nice extras, and it's a movie one can easily watch again and again. Two thumbs way, way up!

Although I rarely read contemporary romances, the reviews made this sound like a good possibility. I managed to finish it. But it required effort. This book is more adventure/thriller and lust than romance, and the thriller part is not urgent enough to keep the pages turning and is too quickly resolved to justify its word count.The relationship between Alec and Domini is never given emotional depth, and Domini seems to readily give up all her previous views on life at the end. Sizemore simply did not make me believe in them as a couple.

The Duke of Tresham is arrogant, reckless, bad-tempered, and often feared...except by Jane Ingleby. That fact alone both irritates and fascinates him. As he recuperates, she soon burrows into his heart, causing him to open up, and begin to clean out old, festering wounds.And Jane thinks herself a fugitive from the law, and because she is actually a lady, she can never return to her former life after staying in his home as a servant--even if charges of murder and theft did not hang over her head. So Jane agress to become his mistress. Yet, Jocelyn (Tresh) senses that there is something wrong with the arrangement.Jocelyn soon spends most of his free time with her and, in the process, continues to rediscover who he was meant to be. It's really beautiful. Balogh has such a gift for dealing with deep-seated human emotions and fears and pain. But they both has much to confront and overcome; &quot;the course of true love never did run smooth.&quot; And so they hurt each other repeatedly before they grow and trust enough to make it work.A beautiful story.

I was totally hooked with the prologue. Even though I discovered that this was the second in a series, I could not wait to read it.Richard is a fabulous hero--very deep, emotional, and responsible, intelligent. His depression over his wife's &amp; daughter's deaths leads him to contemplate suicide. But along comes brave, stalwart Jessica who, in her determination to protect Gabriella, is willing not only to battle his unwillingness to be the girls' ward, but also to bring him back from the brink of self-extinction. They are superb together.Secondary characters run the gamut: Richard's sister-in-law Rachel (who stars in the next book), Jessica's ex-fiance, a Bow Street Runner, a mystery woman, and a murderous villain, among others. Several are not what they seem. The mystery is a bit convoluted, but nothing in it turned me off the book.

I'm a Candice Hern fan, but this is my first of her series Regencies. It clearly shows why she's moved into single titles. It's a familiar plot, but Hern gives it a unique twist. The characters are very well drawn, and the likeable ones are indeed likeable. Rosalind and Max are well suited and the tension is just right for this sort of book. I usually read one of these every now and again to break things up from my usual titles, but this was so good, it had me picking up another one immediately(by another author, and no where near as good). While not perfect (minor flaws only) -- thus probably a 4.9 rating really -- it's by far one of the best series Regencies I've read. I'll look for more by the talented Hern. Truly delightful.

This book by Farr has few glaring historical errors and focuses on a simple, sweet love story (or two). There's a fair amount of humor as hero Jack sets out to foil his mother's schemes in an outrageous manner. Instead he evokes the heroine's sympathy -- and her sad story evokes his. Naturally, it all leads to love and marriage.The mother is an extremely manipulative woman; just when you think she might have a redeeming quality ot two, you find out she doesn't. The rest of Jack's family are mostly sketches, not fully realized characters. The cat is, indeed, wonderfully written; I could picture my own cats doing those very things. Celia, the heroine, is almost too sweet at times, but then displays a robust bit of stubbornness against the Duchess' manipulations. Jack too is nearly flawless, but certainly a pleasant fellow who enjoys life. I have to wonder, however, how he will manage all his future ducal duties.Nevertheless, Farr's book is sweet and humorous, with enough holiday atmosphere. Celia seems to get over her family's loss too quickly; later timing would have made the transition smoother. But the books ends with a wonderfully romantic gesture that should leave a smile on the reader's face.

Anthologies of this type are always hit or miss affairs. Even those with the big single title names vary in quality. This edition was, to my mind, utterly miserable. Even those authors who usually have something decent to contribute were a great disappointment.I managed to trudge through Barbara Metzger's story, even though I couldn't stand any of the main characters. Two couples, and the only sympathetic person among them was the mistress! The mice were annoying.I then forced myself to skim through Allison Lane's and Diane Farr's tales, but neither was worth it. Lane's situations were ridiculous and would never have occured in the time period. It started out well, but deteriorated once the house party ensued. As for Ms. Farr's story, I can't help but believe that the hero will one day rue marrying such a reckless girl. Her only redeeming quality was her peppiness, which was exhausting. I simply couldn't bring myself to even attempt the last two stories.Avoid this one at all costs. It is dull and silly.

This book was very nice indeed. I LOVE Jarred. What a sweet boy he was, but he was turned into a scarred man...rescued by love. Sigh. The preview had me on pins and needles waiting for the book to be released, and I wasn't disappointed.Sarah is headstrong, wearing her heart on her sleeve. Only when she realizes that she loves in vain, that he'll never be able to love her back, to marry, does he realize his love/need for her.Delicious romance on so many levels. I can't wait for Daniel and Miranda, who are excellent secondary characters here. 4 and 1/2 stars, and I'm tempted to give it 5.

This is my first Margaret Moore book, but it won't be my last. Diana, an forthright wannabe author, is a refreshing heroine. Edmond's reputation as a libertine and ne'er-do-well is mostly the work of a schoolmate with an ax to grind. In reality, he's a charming, intelligent, honorable man. Only Diana sees past the gossip and the facade to the real man. Their early verbal sparring is great fun, and their growing feelings for each other usually come across realistically. These two will be great friends as well as lovers.Edmond's friends are interesting and are noticeably set up as future leading men...something I'll be investigating shortly. Only the villain of the piece is also a good secondary character. Diana's Aunt Euphenia had potential, but she needed more space to achieve it. The other aunt was stereotypical. The excerpts from Diana's novel in progress were a nice touch, but there is something a bit off kilter about Diana's test near the end.Moore uses a great deal of exposition in this book, perhaps too much. I couldn't stay focused, but I'm not sure if that is the fault of the book or other "real life" factors, so I'm not taking points off for that. However, Moore's grammatical errors -- especially prevalent early in the book--irked this English major. Nevertheless, the book not only has interesting characters in an engaging romance, but also an insightful look into the process of writing. Most writers will identify with Diana's struggles and though processes.

I enjoyed this book a good deal despite its somewhat one-note tone and less-than-deep lead characters. I'll agree with another reviewer that Drury is a more intriguing man, but Brix has his moments. I could see him as a good friend, but his joking ways would annoy me for anything else. The real problem here as regards characterization is that Fanny is never shown as a mousy little thing. The first time we see her, she's throwing flames! Moore spend too much time telling instead of showing. And her descriptions tend to become repetitive. Brix's change of heart could have been more convincing. These two are not as clearly defined as Edmond & Diana from Kiss Me Quick.However, there are excellent moments, many of them between friends and siblings, but also some between the two lovers. And the pacing is very good. The letters from a friend were an interesting way to open chapters, but they tended to keep the focus on Diana rather than on Brix and Fanny.It's not a terrifically written book, and its leads aren't the best, but the pacing and other elements help lift the quality of the book. Three & 1/2 stars.

I debated about the rating on this one. James had been built up from the first book, so I was really looking forward to his story. However, he is so full of guilt (understandable as it is) that it quickly becomes tiresome. Fewer but more poignant instances would have been a better approach. Phillipa, while intelligent and brave, also seems very young.As is typical of the series, the hero-spy has trouble unmasking the heroine, that is, seeing her for who she truly is and determining her guilt or innocence. Makes you wonder about their spying abilities, which is actually mentioned by the heroines. This time that flaw is more grating somehow.Robbie is a delightful boy and is well used to bring out traits of both protagonists. The intrigue is more prominent in this book. There is less humor and true romance, though the chemistry is there. At first, it's all friendship for James--thankfully no &quot;lusting for a man&quot; stuff. But Phillipa (Flip) is smitten early on. Her decisions serve to bring up James' guilt and self-directed anger. Their reconciliation seems too quick and the epilogue adds little that's new.I'm waiting to learn what happened, will happen to Ren.Somewhere between 3 &amp; 1/2 and 4 stars.

Sigh -- so many readers latch on to one small incident and trash the whole thing because of it, and all without looking at the whole. As to the issue of abuse, Jo Beverley is known for dealing with difficult and sometimes uncomfortable (to be kind) issues. Abuse is one of the issues addressed in "An Unwilling Bride." Yes, the reader can be rightly concerned about the hero's temper and the one (count 'em, one) time Lucien backhands his wife. I am NOT justifying his behavior, but reading his reaction and all that follows, he seems to be even more upset about it than she is. Lucien is appalled at himself. It is also true that he is at times emotionally cruel to Beth early on, but it is the result of a very serious misunderstanding that she caused and a backlash from his own pain. As unpleasant as that is, it's real; people really do lash out at others when they themselves are in pain, particularly if the other person manges to add to the load. In addition, she is a virago early in their relationship, due in large part to her trying to get out of a marriage she doesn't want. Nevertheless, she is truly obnoxious at times and there is a portion of the book in which the reader may not like either character. Both are dealing with very difficult situations they feel powerless to change, and both have very strong, independent-minded personalities. Friction is inevitable. Moreover, responses that so berate Lucien fail to recognize that people are imperfect; they make mistakes. Odd how Lucien is condemned for one terrible mistake and the rest of his character, which is very fine indeed, is overlooked. At least Beth comes to realize that she started their problems (not "is responsible for his hitting her") and continued to exacerbate them. Like all relationships, both are responsible.Did those who dubbed this book a typical Regency (or those who could not get past the one incidence of violence) actually finish the book? The message is that neither physical nor emotional abuse is acceptable. The couple must learn to deal with each other with respect, compassion, and understanding. And there is plenty of meat for the idea of equality between the sexes, too. Beverley's book takes a realistic look at the issue of spousal abuse in the Regency period (and one must keep in mind the historical context), as well as the misunderstandings and compromises necessary in a marriage between such high-spirited people, the gap between the aristocracy and lower classes, the sorrows and concerns of war, and much more. It is a deep book which, it seems, is not appreciated by all.Jo Beverley has a gift for writing unique books. Somehow Beverley manages to deal with difficult subjects at the same time that she presents interesting twists on standard plots such that each book is new (not becoming repetitive as even other good authors are want to do) and the characters are individual and memorable. I liked Lucien a lot -- other than the anger, which is explained in everything he has to deal with at that moment (and all who know him agree that, although he has a temper, he is acting far from normal), and the time he hit her. I'm less pleased with Beth's stubborn and selfish actions that keep creating more problems for them. For example, one of her hang-ups is that he's of the aristocracy; it takes her a long time to start to get past that, in part because of her own self-righteousness and her ignorance of aristocratic duties. While she cannot be blamed for his hitting her, Beth was responsible (she herself admits it) for making a difficult situation horrid. She does, however, realize eventually that she's wrong and begins to soften and compromise. In the end, they come to appreciate each other's strengths and to become friends and lovers in the sort of marriage most intelligent people would appreciate (and violence has no part in it).It is because of those two "flaws" and the fact that I would like to have had a little more attention to Lucien's parents (especially at the end when JB could have dealt with Lucien's evolving relationship with them) and a greater emphasis on the couple's falling in love with each other (making it clearer in actions, not just the sudden declaration, considering all that happened beforehand)...because of those things, I give it 4 stars.It is not necessary to read the Company of Rogues series (and the companion books about the 3 Georges) in order; they are each delightful, intense stories, and all of the characters mentioned are given enough space to be understood even though they appeared in previous books. Having said that, however, reading them in order cannot help but add to the experience by allowing everything to fall into place in the correct order, since the plots as well as the characters overlap somewhat.Short version: If you cannot get past the issue of violence, you'll hate this book. If you can delve deeper, looking at larger issues, motivations, the intricacies of character, and all the other realities of life (especially life in a given historical period) that Beverley refuses to smooth over or ignore, you'll have a wonderful read on your hands.

Perhaps "Scandal" isn't the best title, but that isn't always the author's decision. Anyway, even though these may not be Britton's best characters (Rein, at least), their chemistry is undeniable. There are indeed some very...ahem...hot scenes. Others have complained about Rein not being more help to Anna; I found it in character considering all we know from him before she enters his life. I, too, wonder if she'll really be hapy with him over the long haul considering the apparent disparity in their intellects. I think, however, that was Britton was aiming for was that Rein have a learning disability. It could have been presented in a way that didn't sometimes make him seem "stupid," but people often live up to (or down to) others' expectations of them. Pehaps that was the case with Rein. It's an imperfect book, but has mostly good things to recommend it. I'd put it in the middle of the trilogy ratings wise (about a 3.8).

This book is both funny and touching. Kyrian, if a little too perfect physically, is both tortured and very likable. Certainly all his co-workers like him. He is torn between protecting both himself and Amanda and his overwhelming attraction to her. Kenyon writes truly tortured heroes. Amanda tries so hard not to be like her wacky family, and then she finds herself handcuffed to a vampire--worse, she falls in love with him. Her unlimited accaptance of him is the key to both their relationship and the evil they face. Still, Kenyon's female leads are less well-developed than the males.I happened upon "Dance with the Devil" first, so I had a major learning curve getting into Keyon's Dark-Hunter world. This book, at the beginning of the series, is much clearer about creatures who inhabit this imaginative world. I was quite impressed with Kenyon's ability to take Greek myths and morph them into this paranormal world.My complaints are a heavy preponderence of gratuitous sex scenes; only a few truly further the relationship. More damning is that the sex overshadows the love rather than verifying it. We know the love is there, but it is rarely shown in any fashion other than sex. The relationship could have been richer. Finally, except for being told briefly about the rest of her family, we're never given clues to Amanda's supernatural powers until Kyrian says she has them. Then, at the crucial moment, they suddenly appear.It's a good if imperfect read. Kenyon is not Teresa Medeiros, but she's interesting enough and her Dark-Hunter world is a fascinating creation.

Ferdinand is a warm, generous, kind, and cheerful person--utterly charming--which is interesting since he seemed so immature in the previous book &quot;More than a Mistress&quot; which took place 4 years earlier. What a difference in maturity 4 years can make. He's just splendid.Viola is loving, spirited, and generous...until he arrives to take away her home. As the story progresses, the shocking truth is revealed: Viola has an alter ego, the most expensive courtesan in London. Ferdinand shatters her new life by winning her home in a card game, but she is determined to fight back. As she falls in love with him, however, can she bring herself to use her wiles on him and seduce the house away from him?The book is not always pleasing; the thread where she agrees to be his mistress (even though he wants to marry her) even though she doesn't really plan to is somewhat muddled. But the ending is a resounding success.The best part of this book, to me, is Ferdinand--he's not your average Regency romantic hero, and as much as I like them, he's more the kind of guy you could actually live with.As a bonus, you get to check up on Tresh and Jane from &quot;More than a Mistress&quot; and see how marriage and family have continued to change the dear Duke.

The Bride Thief is a rousing good story with a delightful leading couple. Samantha is so ordinary (to a modern reader)-- average looks, wears glasses, is socially inept -- and so extraordinary (for a Regency heroine)-- intellectual, a scientist of sorts, a spinster who harbors secret dreams (in her journal) of love with a knight in shining armor. Eric is a handsome, wealthy nobleman who hides a secret life as a notrious kidnapper, one who sets women free from forced marriages to live their lives as they choose.When he wrongly rescues Samantha, Eric is immediately enchanted with this romantic bluestocking. Her relationship, and later Eric's, with her brother is sweet and wonderful. There's humor, passion, heartache, and longing in this well-written, well-paced novel.Flaws include an appalling inability to properly use pronouns (I groaned every time I read something like &quot;for Samantha and I.&quot; No one with an exceptional formal education would repeatedly make such mistakes.) and an astounding number of closed doors hardly in keeping with the period. There were some inconsistencies as well, such as the glaring problem of Eric being concerned about Samantha's safety from the law, but not even considering the safety of his real accomplice, a man who was like a father to him. Also, Eric's sister's sadness was a bit overdone for the details we are made privy to.These problems are minor, however, compared to all the good things about this book. So read and enjoy.

Ahhhh, Robert. A truly beguiling hero: Kind, generous, handsome, sexy, charming, and actually looking for true love and a forever marriage. A few of those in real life would marvelous.Allie....she's no Elizabeth (Whirlwind Wedding). Sure, she hurt, scarred, but she's so sad that she's often boring. When she's not boring, she's often annoying because she refuses to see Robert for who he is. Instead, she sees him as just like her toad of a (dead) husband. Even though Robert does nothing but smile and act like the charming man he is to make her think so. Oh, and he has a secret. Not once does she think his secret is a matter of honor. She never gives him the benefit of the doubt. He has to risk his life for hers to make that happen. Sheesh!The book was slow and rather plodding for the first half--despite abductions, attempted murder, robberies, and so on. Robert & Allie had to get to Bradford Hall for real excitement to kick in. Their relationship didn't move forward until then either. The second half of the book was much better, even though Allie was still annoying at times. It was nice to see Elizabeth & Austin again. Caroline was there, too, but Miles was merely window dressing, and I missed him. New character, Michael, was interesting, but there seems to be no forthcoming book for him. Indeed, it would a trial to fit it into the sub-genre's requirements.This effort is nowhere near as good as Whirlwind Wedding, but readers of that book will want to read Robert's story, and he is a swoon-worthy hero.

The humor in this book tended primarily toward slapstick, and though it was funny at times, I've read much funnier. Katie MacAlister's Improper English is funnier by a a hundred miles. Some scenes, like the Renaissance Ball, went on too long.Honestly, much of it was too slow and uninteresting to me. It took me a good while to read it. In fact, I stopped about 1/3 of the way through and read two other books before I made myself get back to it. The second half was better, but it's not one I'll buy or reread. Then again, contemporaries aren't my favorite romances anyway.Nutshell: okay, a few excellent scenes, not that funny, too long, not engrossing enough. But I'm bumping it up to three stars to account for my possible aversion to contemporary romances.

I have really mixed feelings about this book, which makes it hard to review. Christian was wonderful in A Girl's Guide to Vampires, but for me he seems to be lacking something here. I can't put my finger on it, but he seems different. Allie is a mixed bag, too. Sometimes I liked her and sometimes I didn't. Part of it, though, was the first person point of view. It's not my favorite, and it didn't work for me in this book. First person in a sex scene is just weird. Allie is strong, though, and eventually finds her footing as a character. The ghosts make interesting secondary characters, although the villains are cardboard characters. The paranormal fights are pretty cool, though, and make for some good suspense.

I was so looking forward to Stephen Ball's story -- but this book made him boring. And Laura -- neither the character nor the author could decide what kind of woman she was. I still have no idea what they saw in each other, espeically what he saw in her, and I'd be very surprised if their marriage worked over the long haul. But I did love that he cried when they (finally) made love. He's so sweet, but he doesn't come across as well in his own book as he did in all the other Rogue books.The sub-plot takes up too much time. Worse, of 45 chapters, about 20 were so deadly dull that I started skimming or risk not being able to finish the book at all. They just dragged on forever with little action and a lot of repetition. The dangers just faded away at the end, and many of the problems were never really dealt with. Even Nicholas &amp; Eleanor Delaney's appearance was a let-down.Beverley is capable of so much better. I'll have to try to bring back the Stephen of the previous novels in order not to think of him as rather dull. Don't buy it; don't read it--you won't be missing anything.

First off, there are some good things here. Words that are endlessly misused, for example. Words that are truly difficult to differentiate because the differences are more in the connotation than in the actual definition. Words that are often or can be easily used confused. Words nobody bothered to teach you how to understand and use correctly.Then again, there are also words that should not be in here at all. Words no one cares about (pneu.... -- who cares!). Words that are used too infrequently to be a part of a book like this (bunghole, confit).And there are the errors. Words that the author defines too narrowly (diet, depression, via); the "preferred" definition isn't the only correct one. Words that can be either different in meaning or synonymous, depending on the context (such as the debate on "inclusion" and "mainstreaming"). Pet peeves are not the same as errors (done, finished, & completed). And the plain wrong (yes, "hysterical" also means "extremely funny.") Being politically incorrect is not grammatically (or any other use of words) incorrect (gyp -- and that's not a definite reference to gypsies; funny, "redneck" wasn't in there).This book is fine as one of many references, simply because it does have a number of misused words in one place. But be aware that it has errors and tends to be too narrow in its definitions. You will need other resources. Check what you read here against other sources before you take it to heart.

In the first story, Lord of the High Lonesome, Reese is kinda cool, but Kit has the biggest chip on her shoulder. She is very hard to like, which makes the story hard to like.In Heart of Stone, it's the hero who's a problem. He is such a jerk! Stephanie is okay, and her brother's nice.In both stories, the girls are simply too young for their positions. The writing is good, but the characters ruin the story.

Mallory makes a hit with her debut novel. Despite some unfortunate plotting problems--minor but irritating things like people standing and then standing again or, worse, leaving the room and then leaving again a few lines down the page--this story exhibits strong main and secondary characters, a reasonable suspense plot, and deft, interesting writing. Mallory's descriptions really set the stage, and the romance moves along at just the right pace.I loved the hero, and liked the heroine; her acid tongue and sometimes nearly irrational hatred of the nobility occasionally went too far, but they did show her as a likeable, intelligent but imperfect person. James' friends will likely be heroes in the upcoming books, and that's a good thing; they're just as interesting, if not more so, than James. I did think the big declaration lacked punch and the epilogue was a bit weak. But overall, it was a most enjoyable read. For a first novel, it was very, very good.

While there are a few errors and a less than satisfying ending, Sparks' debut novel is a rousing good time. Virginia and Quin are terrific leads, and the secondary characters are almost as good. The humor can be subtle or laugh-out-loud, and there's plenty of it. There's also an appropriate amount of danger for our spies--professional and amateur. And the chemistry is good, too. My biggest problem with the novel was the ending -- I found it unbelieveable. The British are really going to let a known spy go scot free when they can find him through his shipping company? I got no sense of safety for the lovers' future together, and that bothered me. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. 4.8 stars.

Chase has a real winner here. Chase does a tremendous job of showing the hurt child inside the lonely man's body of our hero, Dain. He is so superbly drawn, perhaps one of the most memorable heroes I've had the pleasure of reading about. Jessica is one of the strongest heroines ever written; she refuses to be defeated and so never gives up. Her insight into boys (and thus men) makes her the perfect woman to reach Dain and his son.The romance is witty, touching, warm, and sensual. Although there are secondary plot elements, the romance and the relationship take center stage. It needs nothing else to maintain the reader's interest throughout. Excellent!

While this may not be Ms. Smith's strongest book, I liked it. I enjoy character studies, so if you don't, you may have problems with this. I enjoyed the childhood sweethearts aspect very much; it was so obvious they belonged together. What a wonderful relationship they have. The book also provides more insight into the unmarried brothers, especially Brahm.On the negative side, North's and Octavia's reasons (especially his) for not pursuing a relationship (or even acknowledging a friendship) became old and weak. It was not, perhaps, the most compelling books in terms of its suspense. But I felt that the strong emotional pull and chemistry between the characters overshadowed these negatives.If I had the ability to give portions of stars, I'd rate it at 3.8, but that may only be because I just finished In the Night, which I LOVED. So I'm giving In Your Arms Again a solid 4 stars. I might have rated it higher than four if I'd reviewed it before reading the next entry. I think this is a solid link in the series, one that helps build the whole into something truly wonderful.

Terrific book! Wynthrope exceeded every expectation. He's the best Ryand brother yet, though I'm leaving room in my heart for Brahm, who is also beautifully portrayed here. Moira is perfect for Wyn, who feels himself unworthy of love. This is a relationship where the two people really do make the other a better person, bringing out their strengths and giving them the confidence and courage to be themselves. The Ryland brothers' relationship is a beautiful thing here as well. And Wyn's proposal is one of the most romantic I've ever read. I cried as much as Moira. If you read nothing else of Kathryn Smith's read this one. This is one book purchase I'm thrilled with.

The pros and cons lead to an average, or slightly higher than average rating. I really liked the fact that both protagonists were writers; Julian writes & says some deliciously romantic things. Their misunderstandings were presented in such a way that you came to understand their actions and animosities. Charles is a truly despicable villain. Very sexy book, often emotionally captivating.On the down side, Letitia ....I never liked her. Julian did not handle her well, and neither did Sophia. The Charles situation was never fully resolved, and there needed to be more about what Julian and Sophia loved about each other.

Francis is wonderful. There's no place else to start. No other man could have been what the heroine, Serena, needed. He is kind, gentle, and patient, and a world removed from most heroes in the love &amp; morality department. He is also very honorable, which creates a difficult situation for him that ends in the love of his life.Serena is a slightly &quot;tainted&quot; heroine, though through no fault of her own. Her family, her brothers in particular, are vile creatures who ultimately get what they deserve. And, thanks to Francis and the Rogues, Serena gets the place in society and the love and security that she deserves. It's a beautiful tale.As is typical with Beverley's novels, there's darkness present--this time in the form of the humiliations of Serena's first marriage and how that affects her relationship with Francis. But it's a case of all's well that ends well. This story is somewhat bittersweet, and a part of me wonders how much difficulty they'll have making it work in the long haul. But if anyone can, it's sweet but strong Francis.As other writers have said, the race scene is hilarious (you'll meet it again in Dangerous Joy), and the secondary romance with Francis' mother is rather silly. But all told, a great read.

What does that title mean? Anyway, this is my first Karen Hawkins book, which I purchased based on the plot and the endorsement by Julia Quinn. I have to think, however, that the endorsement is a general one, not necessarily for this book. That's not to say that it's a bad book--not at all--but it's not in league with JQ either.The story is pleasant, has a bit of intrigue (especially with 2 villains, one for each lead), a hefty dose of laugh-out-loud humor, and nice couple. Chase is a bit selfish and spoiled, but also haunted (wrongly as it turns out). The reader can feel his despair and longing. Enter the ever-so-competent Harriet, who inspires him to get out of himself and look at life and family differently. Their relationship doesn't sizzle, but you can certainly see their growing respect and friendship. Chase is the one who really changes in the novel, with Harriet's changes being more of an awakening.There are fun moments based on wrong identities, occasional farce, and warm, familial asides. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter do have a pattern, though it's not always obvious what they have to do with the chapter, and some are quite amusing. I don't know if this is a pattern with this series, but the gimmick could, if better executed, make these books distinctive similar to JQ's Lady Whistledown (though not as integrated into the plot).All in all, a nice book, but not up there with the best of them. If I could, I'd give it 3 &amp; 1/2 stars. I was leaning toward 4 before I wrote this review, if only because of the laughter. But as I wrote it and remember how slow it was in the beginning, I think I'll wind up with 3 stars -- though 3 &amp; 1/2 is truly more accurate. It's good enough that I'll read Hawkins' other books in this series; JQ hasn't led me astray before.

Perhaps not quite as good as I'd anticipated -- I've loved the series -- but still very enjoyable. Marcus is overly starched and emotionally repressed. But the St. John talisman ring, Honoria Baker-Sneed, and a ridiculous coachman come to his rescue -- whether they mean to or not. Honoria is a remarkable woman, taking care of her brood of younger siblings, who add a marvelous element to the story. In Honoria, Marcus has met his match -- but he almost loses her because he can't "get in touch with" his emotions. There's little trust between them early on, and plenty of misunderstandings, but eventually of course, they manage to work it out.

I truly enjoyed this story and chose not to give it 5 stars because I try to reserve that for books of astounding quality and/or amazing emotional depth. Nevertheless, I really liked both Anthony and Daphne and found her transformation, which was more of a revelaing, to ring true. Perhaps our experiences and insights color our perceptions of such things.The tension was not very high, but then one always knows the outcome of a romance--that's one of its charms. The question is always how we get there. In the case of this book, the road is sweet and slow, punctuated with the uncertainties of a plain, always-in-the-background woman and the roll-over-everyone insensibilities of a duke. She learns confidence, and he learns both a measure of humility and the positive power of love. Together they learn that rarest of gifts--a deep love between people who understand and respect each other, and who recognize their faults and the struggles they will face, but deem their love worth the effort.It's a quick read that is throughly pleasurable. It may not be a book you'll remember forever or one that wrings your heart with its emotional impact, but it is utterly enjoyable, well-written, and a delightful way to spend a few hours.

I have generally found single-title romances to be much superior, but this Regency is is better than many single titles. The heroine is intelligent, witty, charming, and practical. Her relationships are mature and sensible. The hero realizes he has some growing to do even before he meets her; she becomes (sometimes without their realizing it) the major impetous to his change. He even realizes that she's more intelligent than he is. Yet they are a good match...soul mates.There's also humor in addition to some very realistic soul-searching and the disbelieving responses of others to someone who's trying to make positive changes in his life. Darn near perfect in every way.

Lilah &amp; Drake have to be the most immature, least likeable couple in all of romantic fiction. They are both selfish, unthinking, rash, self-absorbed, flighty, shallow, and lacking in common sense. Their constant arguments grew old quickly, and their &quot;attraction&quot; rang false. No one but Drake has the spine to stand up to willful Lilah. Everyone but Lilah simply humors Drake. Yet, we're supposed to believe that they are acting out of character. Doesn't hold water.The story line is uninspired, the pacing drags, and the dialogue and sentiments all too often sound modern not Regency. Lilah's companion is an annoying chatterbox, her father is a wimp (except when it suits the plot), and what little humor is there is bludgeoned into an ephemeral mist by the utter silliness and head-pounding annoyance of the rest of the book.One of the worst &quot;mistakes&quot; was having Rival (from The Fortune Hunter, a wonderful book) appear as an unrepentant rake. In his book (published prior to this one), he falls in love &amp; marries. So why is he apparently cheating on his beloved wife in this story? Very badly done.Ignore this book; it's horrid. It's so bad (especially compared to The Fortune Hunter) that I have to read somebody else for a while.

This is my first Liz Carlyle book, and I am thoroughly impressed. Her writing style is quite a departure from the majority of romance authors--more literary and delving more into psychological issues. Except for a few lines here and there when the wording almost seemed to be from the pen of another author, Carlyle's style was both refreshing and consistent.The characterizations are superb. Bentley appears to be a rogue of the worst possible sort. But from the very beginning, the reader senses that beneath his dissipated lifestyle lie a heart of gold and a world of pain. What a splendid hero he turns out to be! The likeable Freddie is not as richly drawn, but you still understand that her gentleness, her willingness to forgive and to work at their marriage and her devotion to family will be the keys to Bentley's redemption.The plot never sags; there are no underdeveloped B plots or side trips that detract from the main storyline. Everything forms a wonderful and cohesive whole. The emotions are intense and real; tears pricked the back of my eyes when all was revealed.I have a new name to put on my favorite authors list.

Alistair is a good hero; his penchant for falling in love quickly was a nice touch. His wounded leg and amnesia worked to make him slightly tortured, just enough to add complexity -- again, a nice variation. My problem with the book was Mirabel; I did not always like her. I thought her obstinancy about retaining the nature of the land around her was never given a sufficiently compelling reason. Worse, the methods she employed against Alistair were sometimes cruel and underhanded. Also the comments about his being a babe when she's done such-and-such...jeez, he's only 2 years younger. Perhaps they were said as a joke, but it wasn't clear and wasn't funny as written. At other times, however, she was quite likeable; it was this mixed feeling about her along with never feeling the same depth of feeling from her that one did from him that shortchanged the romance.Nevertheless, the book had a lot of good points. It's worth reading, but not the best.

Although I enjoyed Miss Wonderful, I liked this sequel even better. Rupert is hilarious -- funny and brash, acting like a "big, dumb ox." But while he may not be as brainy as Daphne, he's not stupid (despite sometimes intentionally acting that way) and he isn't threatened by Daphne's intelligence. She is both astonishingly brilliant and frustratingly repressed, in large part because of the usual negative response to her intelligence. But Rupert makes Daphne come alive, while she curtails his recklessness; it's a relationship of interlocking pieces, where each fills in the other. And there's plenty of humor along with the danger, intrigue, and romance. Readers also get a fascinating look at 19th century Egypt during the archeological rush. There are a few descriptive phrases that are repeated often enough to become cliches and a few scraps of dialogue that sound wooden, but even these are rare. Chase has written a very fine book here, and I look forward to Benedict's story.

Michaels can be quite amusing....or she can merely attempt to be amusing. This book is more the latter. It's rather a matter of overkill; she tries too hard. Sometimes it's funny, but it's more often boring, predictable, or silly (in a bad way). Armand's okay; Allegra is sometimes intriguing and sometimes an annoyance. There's nothing new here -- the same old characters and plots, with the exception of Oxie and his pranks, and they are not that amusing.There's not much to like; I had to force myself to finish. Maybe 2 stars is too generous. I'm not sure I'll be able to get through another Michaels books, but I'm tossing this one immediately.

The last of the George books manages to pull in almost all of the Rogues and neatly ties up several loose ends from a book in that series as well as finally thoroughly reuniting the three Georges.Clarissa is the epitome of the spunky, independent heroine. She is, however, still rather immature and judgemental (especially about Lucien) at the beginning of the book. She grows out of that by the end of the novel. She does know what she wants and she goes after it, or rather him.Some see Hawk as cold and manipulative. I think he's merely focusing on the goal (proving the will false), a single-mindedness that made him such a valuable officer. We do see him struggle internally with his feelings for Clarissa and the actions he takes that will hurt her. Although he is not as forceful a character as the Rogues, he is a saner, calmer influence on Clarissa--a needed contrast.It's engaging, if not heart-pounding, and does a superlative job of connecting the Georges and the Rogues, effectively pulling Hawk and Van into the Rogue family (Con's already one).I like this book, but I'd wait for Beverley's new release that includes all three George stories. That way, I can get Van's story (my favorite) without buying the horrid anthology it's in.

Better than Morgan's tory, but still not close to Balogh's best.I SO wanted to love this book, but it is rather plodding and has little romance or sensuality to recommend it. Alleyne has been one of my favorite Bedwyn's; I was so heartbroken at his seeming fate in Slightly Tempted, which parallels this one in time. But I don't quite know what to make of him in this book. Worse, Rachel seems to almost be two different women. I just wasn't convinced of their chemistry. There was more saying than showing going on.The cast of secondary characters, however, was absolutely delightful. Alleyne was much more interesting with them than he was with Rachel. And the absence of the rest of the Bedwyn's was felt here just as it was in Morgan's story. Indeed, perhaps the best scenes in both books was Wulfric's reaction to news of Alleyne in each. How I long for that book (should arrive any day now); it had better be good--I've been waiting for Wulfric's story for a long time.This story also doesn't touch the heart as deeply as Balogh's works usually do, although Alleyne's response to the war had more impact than Morgan's because it was more subtle and less preachy. There is a good deal of humor both Alleyne and Rachel have good senses of humor, as go the brothel ladies. The story goes awry when Rachel becomes morose and waspish. Alleyne's amnesia lasted a while, and his fear over returning home was interesting but not dealt with fully enough.Important to the series, definitely -- but I'm hoping that Wulfric's story gets back to the high quality, heart-touching work Balogh is known for.

Five stars are simply not enough. If a romance could reach perfection, this would be a very serious contender.I had no choice but to stay up to the wee hours to finish it. It is, by far, one of the most emotionally compelling books I have ever read. I frequently had to get up to fetch more tissues--tears of both joy and sorrow. It is emotionally and psychologically deep and honest. Although I have often been moved by good writing, few novels have touched me so deeply.Balogh convincingly shows us the growth of a relationship based on true knowledge of another person and selfless compassion. Although desire is there, unlike most romances, it hardly takes center stage. The result is beautiful and warmly haunting.Kit and Lauren are well-rounded and compelling characters. Balogh sets their characters before the reader and slowly peels back the layers until we (and the other) can see who each one truly is underneath their social masks. The reader has no doubt that this is a love that continue until death and beyond.I am near to tears just writing this review--that's how marvelous this book is. If you read only one romance in your life, make it this one.

While I like Susan Krinard, I'm not one of her most devoted fans. I always find her stories lacking something. However, I think this entry in the series is one of her better ones. While the question of how Tomas never realized that Sim was a werewolf is never answered, Sim is a strong hero, having evolved in Tomas' book from a little more than a bitter bully. Tally is just as flawed in the world's eyes, and their romance is a clarion call for all imperfect people. The secondary romance and all the twists and turns add to the story's interest and complexity. Some things are too clear-cut -- even society's dismissal of Tally -- and some are smoothed over -- like Tally's response to the truth of her brother's betrayal. Such things drop the book under a five-star rating. Nevertheless, the story and the characters keep the reader's attention. This is a good one to read.

The hero and heroine are unique, and their romance in intriguing. Sarah's self-doubts and hurts are filled with a familiar passion. Colin's need to prove himself provides much of the plot. There are odd moments that do not feel quite right, occasions when you want to yell at one of them, and some times when you wondered where the rest of the story was (once Sarah married, her business became nothing more than a device). But they rarely detract from the story and never in any substantial way. Although the secondary characters in Sarah's life generally annoyed me, Colin's Giles was a gem.Defintely worth a read and will probably go on my to-buy list. For a first novel, it's exceptional.

DK makes gorgeous books, and this is no exception. Other books are more comprehensive, but there's a different reason for adding this one to your collection. It has an embarrassing wealth of visuals, the timelines let you see what was happening simultaneously in different parts of the world, and the concordance provides a quick look-up for any topic (person, place, thing, concept). In the concordance, China, for example, has a brief geographic & political overview, a chronology (all in one place rather than spaced throughout time as in the first section), and lists of rulers. Page references are given to lead the reader to additional information.This book would make an excellent resource for world history teachers and students.

This book is often intriguing, with strong characters, but it veered into the crass rather than the romantic. The relationship was more about sex than love. Dermott was really bad to her, hurting her deeply. Isabella is just as sex-driven. Implausibilities abound, and terms and sayings are just too modern.

Alec is quite wonderful; what a dreamboat. Katherine is sometimes annoying, but she's young and badly influenced. She tends to think the worst of Alec and the best of Sydney, who is such a momma's boy. It is also rather hypocritical of her to be concerned about Alec marrying for money when that was her goal, the difference being it was access to her own money. But she had convinced herself that she was in love with her longtime friend, Sydney.Despite Katherine's sometimes annoying and wrong opinions about Alec and her unfathomable wish to marry Sydney, she does finally see the light and all her best characteristics come forth. The set-up for the series is excellent, and the book has a generous share of delightful scenes. I enjoyed it a lot.

This was my first MJ Davidson book. What a delight! Betsy is a very unlikely and thoroughly amusing heroine. I laughed out loud far too often to count while reading this clever take on vampires. It's pretty earthy at times, so be forewarned, but it also seemed to suit the charcters and "world" perfectly. Also one of the best first-person books I've ever read. This one's a real treat!

I started this book after a series of mediocre reads and was instantly grabbed by it. I had put it near the bottom of my to be read stack because the description was only mildly interesting. Instead this book captured my imagination from the very beginning. Sophie and Mick are well-rounded, interesting, and somewhat different characters. Moreover, they are surrounded by mostly well-drawn secondary characters who enliven the setting.Mick's disbelief of Sophie's foresight provides some splendid scenes as does their growing attraction. The murder mystery keeps the reader's interest and is occasionally as intriguing, if not more intriguing, than the delightful romance. The two plots are seamlessly woven into a magical narrative. This paranormal romance has plenty of realism in its setting and characters. Enchanting.

This sequel isn't nearly as good as Breath of Magic, although it's entertaining. Tabitha can be a bit annoying and Colin is a little too accepting her her strangeness. Nevertheless, there are some truly funny and wonderful moments. The ending was a little too pat, especially the demise of the villain, who was a cartoon character (nothing like the true villainy in Breath of Magic).Best enjoyed if you wait a long time after reading Breath of Magic to pick this one up; won't be quite so disappointing that way. Medeiros can be good or fabulous; this book falls in the good department, but the love scenes are very well done.

At least it's the best I have yet read. Hern does an excellent job of creating a memorable and well-developed heroine in Hannah. She is clumsy, outspoken, witty, intelligent, and vivacious. She's often like a fawn taking his first gamboling race across the meadow. Miles is not as well-developed, but he has the right sort of personality for this sort of more &quot;innocent&quot; romance. Moreover, he is a man who loves deeply and well. Sister Charlotte's personality seems to waver over the course of the book, and the reconciliation does feel somewhat false. The aged rector has much in common with the lively Hannah.There are some very humorous moments; the romance builds steadily and gently. This quote sums up the tone: &quot;She was a mess. She was the most adorable thing he'd ever seen.&quot;For a quick but delightful Regency romance, this is the ticket!

HeartMate was a good book, but I think Heart Thief is even better than its RITA award winning predecessor.I doubted that a story about a guy without Flair (magical ability/psi power) in a world heavily dependent on magic would work well. It, in fact, worked beautifully, not only providing a very strong character in Ruis Elder, but also adding tremendous dimension to the world Owens has created in Celta. In addition to the splendor of that aspect of the story, Ruis & Ailim are a romantic couple that shines. Well-rounded, complex characters who struggle with their lives, their passion & love for each other, and the difficulties imposed by the world around them.Brilliant!

In this book, the characters are interesting (although the secondary characters are often one-dimensional, except for Cheddersby), the setting is different (Charles II, who is also an interesting secondary character), and the hero is not your usual alpha male. There are twists that might even make the reader gasp in surprise, and enough uncertainty in the outcome to keep the reader interested.The problem lies in Moore's trite and often unrealistic dialogue and in the sugary sweetness of the romance. Sweet is fine, but this one too often dives right into the sugar barrel. Had the author's execution of these two things been better, the story would have been at least 4 stars.

Basso's story was okay except the hero was still after another woman for a time. That's more realistic than many other stories, but he didn't seem interested enough in the heroine for so long that their devotion seemed thin. The ending was a problem, too. There were many questions left unanswered. The declaration didn't seem to fit well with the rest of the story. Most importantly, she failed to tell him something VERY important. The reader is left with uncertainy as to the lasting quality of this relationship. It was quite lovely, though, that he's 7 years younger! 1 to 1.5 starsFaulkner's story started with such promise; Ally looked to be a great heroine. But once they met at the ball, it all became lame. There was no evidence of love on his part, and he's not a well-developed character. Worst of all, the author either did not know or did not care about the historical milieu or the social convention of the day. All in all, rather pathetic. ZeroRaleigh had the winner of the bunch. Only one incongruent line at the end spoils the pleasant romp of the whole; it's a nice line, but it's in opposition to the whole of the story. The characters are well drawn and their interaction believeable. I might contemplate buying this book for this story alone, but I'd rather have it in a compilation of Raleigh's work, since the other two aren't great. Story 3 is easily a 3 star work.

I'm not a huge fan of contenporary romances, but I really enjoyed these. Having said that, I probably would have enjoyed them more if I hadn't read them back to back...Just too much at once. For me, the humans are more interesting than the angels as a general rule, but perhaps that's because the angels seem too human sometimes and they explain too much. I do, however, like them very much as a device to set the stage for each romance/situation and to provide the function of an epilogue/look into the future -- although she's gotta quit saying that Gabriel rarely shares that info when he does so in every book.Nevertheless, Macomber creates a wide variety of people, relationships, and situations. In Touched by Angels, she includes a Jewish couple (and family) for example-- Joshua's one of my favorite heroes in this trilogy, although Hannah is too meek-- and well as an inner city school. Ted and Joy of The Trouble with Angels are probably my favorite couple, but Paul's story dragged. I was having trouble sticking with Leah's story in A Season of Angels, but it was worth it in the end, and Chet and Monica were an interesting if unlikely couple.If you're looking for some stories to get you in the holiday spirit, remind you of what's really important at this or any other season, and/or be uplifting while being romantic, Macomber's angel stories are just the thing.

This resource is well organized, has some terrific quizes, and does a very good job of explaining causation and effects. The unit overviews are splendid. Unfortunately, it also contains some factual errors, so be sure to use other resources as well. The information is sometimes too thin, such as the explanation of the Protestant Reformation (not even a mention of Luther's 95 Theses). at other times, the book has more info than most, such as the effect of the printing press or the contributions of Issac Newton.It has a very slight European viewpoint, but is fair in its presentations. One of the best things about this prep book, which allows anyone to use it for world history review of any type, is the way it weaves together events and their causes & effects, making the continuity of history and the reason for studying it clear. If not for the factual errors, I'd give it a 5.Also check out Barron's How to Prepare for the SAT II World History, which is very thorough and contains detail that is glossed over in other books. It excels at comparing ideas, peoples, and cultures, and is more accurate, though it lacks the excellent unit overviews. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't seem to carry Barron's SAT II World History. I used a 2001 edition.

Nathaniel, I thought, was a thoroughly likeable hero. Although I didn't like Sophie as well, I thought most of her actions and emotions were realistic for the situation. I thought the development of their relationship was interesting and realistic. They make a good couple. Theirs is not a rolicking tale, but I like the way Balogh deals with deep emotion.Eden and Lavinia were very amusing; I wish they'd had their own book. The villain and his threats weren't much of a threat. I'd give it 3.9 stars.

Being a fan of both genres, I was looking forward to this book; it didn't quite fit the bill for me. Some parts were very good indeed, especially the characterizations. The challenge should have taken up more of the book; it was well done. Tessa kept repeating the same mistakes in her relationship with Kahn; he grew more quickly, in my opinion. I found many of the sex scenes distasteful and lacking in real connection to the plot or relationship. The balance of romance, sex, and sci-fi was off, and the author used too much repetition. I did read the next book (The Dare, but liked it even less). This book didn't live up to the promise for me; I glad I checked it out of the library.

Book one, Stolen Heart, was a good book (3 to 3 & 1/2 stars), but Camp follows it up with a better book. Although I liked Alexandra and Thorpe better than I like Marianne and Justin, the book as a whole was better, with a better-paced plot and fun new background characters. Repeat characters from book one add an enchanting familiarity and continuity.Occasionally the rehash of events from book one are onerous if you've just read that book; readers attacking the series one after the other may want to skim over those areas. But the suspense is improved in this work.Camp needs to work on her endings; they don't pack much wallop and leave me feeling as though something's missing. This is really a 3 & 1/2 star book for me, but it's enough of an improvement over the first one to bump it up a notch.

This was Jo Beverley's first book. It's not really fair to compare it to her later work. All authors improve (or at least they should). However, taking this book as a first work and as a traditional Regency rather than the longer single-title works she now does, I hate to rate it highly.Yes, I wish David were better delineated as a character. Yes, it sometimes dragged. Yes, the plot could have been stronger. And yes, there were times the exposition or dialogue was sub-par. But over all, as a debut novel, it was quite good. When also considering the time in which it was published, it's very good.There are some excellent moments of tension, romance, humor, and intrigue. There are also some fine character moments. If they are not without flaw, I consider that merely a first novel situation. This book is still head and shoulders above so much that is published. I got this book from the library because of the mostly negative reviews. However, I liked it well enough to put it on my "buy" list. I might have rated it 3 stars if not for the other reviews, but it's much better than the rating made it seem.

Contrary to the impression made by the spiel on the back cover, "The Matchmaker" is not a breezy story. It has moments of humor and sweetness, to be sure. But Neville's problems are real and deep, and rightly give both him and Olivia pause. Nevertheless, I am romantic enough to adore a "love conquers all" story.Neville is charming and responsible and sexy, and tortured and lonely and sometimes selfish. He is also the only hero with this wimpy-sounding name who made the name strong. Olivia is something of a prude and a bit self-righteous, but she's also warm and loving and generous and passionate. They make a good couple throughout the book.The secondary characters are well-conceived and add to the story, though Olivia's steward and St. Clair could have been better developed. (I'd love to see a book about little sister Sarah!) The pace never really drags, and the story works beautifully without any intrigue or mystery; this one is just pure romance. The story is wrapped up a little too quickly, a little too neatly, but that's a minor complaint thanks to the strength of the rest of the book. The epilogue neatly and pleasantly provides a heartwarming look into the future.Nice, rich, pure romance.

Dunstan and Leila are opposites in so many ways -- enough so that one might wonder how long the happiness will last -- but their doubts and uncertainties cause them to see beyond their differences. Because she is Dunstan's employer and is accepted in society, Leila often has the upper hand. But Dunstan's acceptance and encouragement of her Malcolm gifts frees Leila to be the woman she desires to be.Leila can be a bit manipulative, but she has used her looks, her social skills, and, at times unwittingly, her magical abilities to secure her acceptance in society and eventually to aid Dunstan. He, on the other hand, comes across as gruff and unsociable, but his heart is sensitive and noble. The inner people are much better matched than the outer ones. The mystery of his wife's murder is kept at an interesting level and does not overshadow the romance. Leila's difficulty in discovering and harnessing her unique gift is a highlight of this book.

Typically I like single-title romances better than series romances and full-length novels better than short stories/novellas. In this book none of the tales were awful, some were entertaining, and at least one was quite good.One of the shorter tales, &quot;The Lucky Coin&quot; by Barbara Metzger was fun and reminiscent of Dickens. A good story; the hero is immediately likeable.&quot;Following Yonder Star&quot; by Emma Jensen was a study in discovering new pleasures and interests as a reluctant master comes to appreciate his new responsibilities. In addition, it starts with a letter that nearly broke my heart and set up the story is the best possible way. At first you really doubt the hero, but he comes through. A pleasant read.Sandra Heath's &quot;The Merry Magpie&quot; started well, but became annoying. I hate that bird. Much of the story is done in flashbacks, and it's rather predictable.Edith Layton's &quot;Best Wishes&quot; was often annoying. I hated both of the groups the couple visited for Christmas. While her family was certainly infinitely better than his pre-marriage friends, I felt very sorry for Jonathan having to put up with that boring family. I never bought into this tale. I kept expecting the couple to decide to resolve their differences by creating new Christmas traditions of their own. A disappointment.Saving the best for last brings us to Carla Kelly's &quot;Let Nothing You Dismay.&quot; It might be worth it to get this book for this story alone. Strong characterizations, poignancy, deep emotional conflicts, and, finally, a story that deals with the deeper issues of love, hope, and other Christmas themes. For this story alone, I'd give the book 3 stars instead of 2.

Lucien is such an interesting character. A hardened spy who has given up everything, including his relationship with his twin brother and his good name, and very nearly lost his soul in the service of his country. He realizes that he is on the verge of truly becoming the monster he pretends to be. He needs, wants to be saved. Enter Alice.Alice, who is so pure it's nearly unbelieveable, is light to Lucien's darkness. Her innocence captivates him, and he realizes that she and only she can save him. Alice, meanwhile, realizes that she is a prisoner in her own life, always submerging her own desires to the needs & desires of others. She needs, wants freedom, and that's where Lucien comes in.Foley does a good job of helping the reader understand the characters' motivations. Lucien, especially, is so vulnerable and needy beneath his spy's mask. Some of the best scenes in the book deal with his emotional turmoil.Some scenes are...risque, but Foley handles them with subtlety. While she has several very hot love scenes, the scenes of emotional intimacy and gentle affection are as, if not more, compelling.I thought the dangerous spy subplot was intriguing and well-paced. Granted, I did become annoyed with Alice not listening to the more worldly-wise Lucien's admonitions regarding her safety. Such actions on Alice's part became mere plot devices. At times, the plot stretched the bounds of credulity.Another annoying aspect was the use of modern vernacular, usually the coarse kind; it detracted from the Regency setting and broke the mood and sense of time and place. Foley also made some plotting errors, like changing the color of Lucien's horse in the pivotal final chase scene

Alex is a superb hero: part irredeemable wastrel, part tortured young man, part charming rake, part lonely man, and part clever hero. He's really terrific, marvelously complex. Octavia is smart, resourceful, and resolute and a good match for Alex, although she's not quite as "real" as Alex. The two young people are beautifully rendered and very realistic.I always find myself steering away from books set in Russia (for some reason), but it didn't throw me off too much here. If there are problems with this book, they're in the plot. Too often the situations they encounter seem staged, too convenient for moving the plot forward. However, Alex (and the kids, to a lesser extent) raise the book up from its problems and make it a real pleasure to read. 3.8 stars.

An interesting twist on the "My Fair Lady" plot. Mick is a coarser hero than we're used to, but as Edwina polishes him up, he looks and acts more the "proper" hero, yet with an earthiness and sweetness of temper that make him unique. I agree with the reviewer who said the leg scene bothered her; I didn't care for it either. But I liked the dancing scene. Watching Mick change his way of thinking and how he struggles with his old life and new desires is engrossing.Edwina is a nice heroine because she's not your typical oh-so-beautiful woman. She's flawed physically, yet this gorgeous man still finds her utterly desireable. I found her lusty actions near the end out of character, and certainly far removed from the period's morals. But Mick's gentle honesty is a treasure -- one there should be more of in the world.I found it slow in the beginning; it took me some time to get into it. I don't think the obvious Pygmalian plot helped any. I was also occasionally put off by the coarseness. But the whole worked well for me. The specific rating I'm giving it is 3.9 stars. This is my first Judith Ivory book; I'll be reading more of them.

A great sequel to "To Marry the Duke." Rawdon is very hunky and sexy, and Clara is a bit wild and incautious. These two can't stay away from each other, but they discover more than passion as Rawdon finally deals with his past hurts even as both of them deal with those who have and would destroy their happiness.Well-written and enjoyable, though sometimes Clara is too trusting, which doesn't seem to jive with some of her experiences. Little problems like that, plus a somewhat restrained emotional quality, lead to the 4 stars instead of 5

Letty is a delightful character, so much fun. Elliot is a sweet man; it's rather pleasant to have a hero who is simply a nice man. And Catherine is a selfish little.....Intriging and funny with just a hint of heartache and danger. The first love scene is a disappointment; it's more about hurt and anger than anything else. Very romantic ending, even if it seems a little out of character for Elliot.My first Connie Brockway book. Good enough to try more from her, but not the best I've read.

The characters were terrific together. Justin seemed a better match for Evelyn than Elliot was for Letty. He's a more complex character, too. While Evelyn is less original than Letty, she has charms aplenty. Justin's butler is a riot.The spy mystery is well-done with enough red herrings to keep you guessing even though you think you know who the spy is. There are some very funny scenes, including Justin trying not to be seduced by Evelyn. The book's very sensual as well, with Justin and Evelyn setting chemical fires all over the place.

Really, this was one of the most poorly written books it has ever been my misfortune to attempt to read. Yes, attempt, because over halfway through, I finally decided that I had wasted enough time hoping it would improve.This book must have been accepted for publication solely on Ms. Cameron's name -- and perhaps the premise, which was not realized well at all. The writing here is so amateurish as to be not laughable, but annoying in the extreme. This is my first (and probably last) Cameron book, so I have to wonder how someone who writes so badly became a bestselling author.Even without the deplorable writing style, the characters here are inconsistent and unlikeable. The hero comes across as weak and rarely acts according to the descriptions of him. The heroine is dull and totally unconvincing. As a reader, I could never care what happened to them, as long as they finally left me alone.This is one of those books I definitely regret buying. The saddest thing is that I bought its sequel the same day; I don't know if I'll ever summon up the courage to crack it open.

I really enjoyed Out of the Shadows, but Miller is even better here. Both if these stories are splendidly done, with warm, likeable characters -- who doesn't adore Valerian anyway -- and just the right amount of suspense. Be sure you read Out of the Shadows ((Forever and the Night & For All Eternity) first for important background. You can enjoy these without doing so, but it will definitely heighten your enjoyment of this duo. This book contains two of the best vampire romances anywhere. Read up!

Some unbelieveable bits and some very confusing elements hurt this book. One problem is evident on the first page. The book is set in 1874, and it's the second book in the trilogy. If you choose to read this one, read it last so that the events are in chronological order. 1874 makes Drew (from Once a Mistress) 86 years old. He's still quite healthy and active (Kathryn is still alive too). Drew's brief but important appearance is too short. It seems implausible that he and Kathryn can travel so easily and at such short notice at these advanced ages. Kit is married; it's mentioned at the end of the book, but it happens in book 3 (hmmm).It's fun at times, and Adam is a pretty good hero, but Giana is often unbelieveable. Adam does seem easily deluded. You can read the other two without this one. Or read this one after the other two. But my advice is &quot;don't buy it.&quot;

One of my all-time favorite books is Pride & Prejudice. While this book often sounds very much like Jane Austen, it's because Dawkins has lifted that author's words and characters from various novels and stitched them together as Lizzy's thoughts -- not all of them in character. There are good moments and it's sometimes fun to try to determine who the characters are, but in the end, it's just playing in Austen's world with midling success. Lizzy's voice is often right, but not always her actions (as related) and thoughts. It's not a bad read, just less than fulfilling.

But then, I haven't been that fond of her others. The Prince of Pleasure presents a deeper relationship and a more involved plot. Although Dare's rationale for his ultra hedonistic lifestyle seems stretched and Julienne's reasons for never revealing the truth about her past appears slight once her mother died, they are still more fully realized characters than I have previously encountered from Jordan's pen. Dare remains rather self-centered for much of the book, but he has a pleasing vulnerability. Julienne exhibits great inner strength.The traitor plot is rather obvious in its intention to thrust these two people together, but it retains a sense of mystery and excitement. The book is sometimes slow, and as always, Jordan allows the sex scenes to dominate the narrative--but much less than usual in this effort, to great effect. Indeed, only toward the end does this penchant begin to annoy.I had intended to avoid more of Jordan's books, but I already had this one from the library and decided to read it, frankly not expecting much. Nicole Jordan will never be at the top of my author's list, but at least I found this one to be better than the others I have read.

Wow! This is one of those books that takes your breath away because of the quality of the writing, the unusual premise, the well-plotted story, and the marvelous characters.Carroll's writing is one of the finest in any genre; it is bold, insightful, and arresting, with exactly the right blend of humor, passion, angst, hope, and danger. The author has created what may be the most unique family in all romance literature, and readers are introduced to the magical St. Legers in a way that can only be described as perfect.The characters, the setting, indeed the entire story, will stay with you long after you have read it. It's one of those books you want to reread from time to time for the sheer pleasure of basking in such excellence.

It took me a while to get into it; I found that I'm not that fond of Harris' writing style -- way too much minor detail for my taste. Later, however, this aspect lessened and the plot thickened.I picked this up to read something different, and it certainly was. Since I don't read a lot of mysteries, I may not be the best to comment. Despite the off-putting cover art, the characters were memorable and the plot kept my interest (once it got going). Still, I found a lot of repetition -- people repeatedly making the same stupid choices, rehashing the same ground in plot point and emotion. Even being from West Tennessee, I still get annoyed at Elvis references in books. And some elements were a bit soap-opera-ish. Such things lowered my enjoyment. Still, I'll read the next one (and maybe more) to see how things progress, since much is left up in the air at book's end.

I liked Crimson City very much, but I liked this sequel better. The romance had a much stronger presence. While there were no huge surprises here plotwise, the whole thing flowed smoothly toward its conclusion. I did miss only hearing about a character or two from the original, but this book had very strong, unique leads and gave terrific insight into the werewolves society, much as the first did for the vampires. This one also provided more info on the "lesser" vampires. Liu was occasionally too heavy on the classism, racism, and other such issues. While the mallet was soft rubber, the reader was still hit over the head with it. Nevertheless, the book was a very good read, engrossing and pleasing. And quite romantic, unlike the first in the series.

This is my first book by Patricia Rice. It was good enough that I'll try more, probably from this series, but it took me some time to become comfortable with the world she had created. perhaps reading the previous books in the series first might have made a difference.Christina is a likeable, quirky heroine, albeit rather spoiled and selfish early on. She learns, however, and does some growing up over the course of the book. Harry is a great hero--a happy-go-lucky, even-tempered man who becomes sullen and tempermental after the dukedom and penury are forced upon him. Christina brings humor and joy to his life, and through her and the discovery of the truth about his situation, Harry begins to revert to his loveable, but now more responsible, self.The book is humorous and interesting, with some ghosts acting as important secondary characters. Christina's family is something as well. There's s bit of suspense with a murderer on the loose. All in all, a very good book. Had I been more comfortable, rather than feeling like I was floundering, early in the book, I might have rated it 4 stars.

While this book wasn't awful, and a rating of 2.7 would probably be more accurate, I found all those dogs annoying more than amusing. The book is something of a farce, more than a romp. Knowle is obnoxious to begin with, his encounters with the dogs are sometimes amusing, and he does grow on you. It's just that I never cared much what happened to the lovebirds, and so much of the story was ridiculously farfetched. Faulty book.

Despite some less than successful elements (like the exorcism & Lucas' total acceptance of Robbins' early beatings), this book successfully reworks the Pygmalion/My Fair Lady storyline, albeit with a twist that not all will find welcome. I do because anything else would have eventually unraveled. The secondary characters are nearly as well developed as the main ones. The secondary romance is off the beaten path. At times, the ghost element was a little strange and overly complex (confusing), but most of the book worked quite well.

A Stolen Heart is an interesting read with both romance and intrigue. Intelligent, forthright, capable Alexandra finds herself immediately attracted to her new, somewhat reclusive business partner, Lord Thorpe. Then she finds herself repeatedly in danger. As they try to unravel the mystery--a mystery that includes her real identity and his doubts about her true purpose and trustworthiness--their attraction just grows.Sometimes this book is thoroughly entertaining; other times it stretches credulity. Sometimes the characters & situations seem vital and fresh; other times it seems a rehash of every romance ever written. All-in-all, it's an enjoyable read, but there are moments of disappointment and frustration. While decent, it's not one of Camp's best. Perhaps it's just too farfetched at times; perhaps there's not enough character development.Ii enjoyed it, but wouldn't buy it.

The trouble with this book is that the hero and heorine are difficult to genuinely like and root for. Marsh is bitter and vindictive and often cruel to Sarah. She simply has no common sense; she repeatedly makes atrocious decisions -- no wonder trouble always finds her.The book isn't horrible; the characters, even the romantic leads, have redeeming qualities and good scenes. But the work as a whole is less than fulfilling and the chemistry between the leads lacks convincing heat. Worse, it lacks the sort of love upon which a good romance hinges.The book is worth reading as part of the series, as long as the reader neither expects too much or is not put off from other books that follow. Perhaps the best character in this book is Sarah's sister's husband's nephew, Adrian Hawke. His story comes up in the Bridemaker, which is an excellent read.

I really enjoyed James' new book. It had all the right elements: a superbly matched lead couple, a romance that sparked instantly but took time to grow deeper, well-developed secondary characters that you look forward to seeing again, wit and warmth and the right touch of sorrow and heartache.While I could have wished that more pages had been devoted to Tess & Lucius' relationship, that's a common difficulty with any first entry in a series; the groundwork for all the other books must also be laid. My rating stems more from the epilogue, which I did not like.All in all, this is one book I'm glad I bought. When there are so many times that I wish I had my money back, that is praise indeed. In fact, it makes me want to pick up another Eloise James book--I think I need to go back and read Your Wicked Ways, which is referred to here. A VERY solid 4 stars, this one.

Ruthven and Antonia are more mature, less prone to flightiness than many romantic couples. One problem with the characterizations is that we are told that Ruthven is a rake, but we see no events that prove it. Antiona, however, is near perfect as a heroine: strong and warm, but wrong in some of her beliefs. They make a good couple, but I would have liked more evidence of their friendship as youngsters.There's a minor subplot involving another couple and one with Ruthven being a role model for Antonia's younger brother, but the primary focus is definitely on the hero and heroine. There are no steamy love scenes, but a great deal of romance, friendship, honesty, and genuine affection. In some ways, it's a much more realistic story.It's not Laurens' best book, but it's a welcome departure from the redundancy that eventually accompanies reading Cynster book after Cynster book. Published in 1997, A Comfortable Wife is more in the mold of Georgette Heyer than the newer, racier novels. I liked it, but rated it 3 stars for missed potential and it not being her best.

Nicholas is a wonderful hero--so generous and compassionate, as well as strong &amp; virile &amp; and all those other things one expects of a hero. Lucy is somewhat weak, though she gains strength during the book. She is an innocent, financially strapped widow; you'd think she'd be more wary after what she's been through. Lucy is also far too forgiving; I found it unrealistic. She, I think, is the weak link in this book.The story line is decent, but it drags, and something about the interactions with the Prince Regent seems false--I can't put my finger on it, but it doesn't feel right. The mystery was handled in fits and starts: sometimes nothing happened at all for far too long; then things would happen far too quickly. The all-or-nothing approach made the plotting uneven.The development of the romance was well-done, however, despite the unbelieveableness of its progression. In that time and place, a single gentleman would never have given all those expensive gifts to a lady--and she could not have accepted them without utter ruination. Ditto living at his home; the gossip should have flayed them both within days.In essence, a sweet, predictable romance fraught with cultural problems and a weak heroine.

The Bride Finder series is in many ways unique among romance books, and Susan Carroll is a superb writer. While I still find the first book to be the best, the others are great reads as well.Val is not your typical romantic hero -- he's almost too gentle sometimes, but that provides a nice contrast to Kate's impetuosity. Kate is an excellent heroine and her talks with the ghost Prospero are most enlightening. Her rashness sets off the chain of events that changes many of the characters in the book. Bad guy Rafe is a good villain, the kind who, though thoroughly selfish, is not all bad and who changes over the course of the story.Ellie again is the Bride Finder, but this time she's standing in the way of true love. This situation eventually makes her a more interesting character.Once again, read the book; it's a good one. The only question is which of the series you'll like best and why.

I loved The Duke's Scandalous Secret, which I read first, but the first in the series lacks a good deal. It has some extremely nice moments and contains a number of "life truths." It was mostly the ending that failed to live up to standards; the reader is not quite convinced of the depth of Nick's feelings for Willie. The unusual secondary characters do make for some interesting moments, but the Duke of Ravensfield (book 2) is often more interesting than this book's hero. It's lighthearted and sometimes amusing, but doesn't fully mesh as a whole and lacks the depth of honest emotion that the best books contain.

This is the first time I've read Connie Lane; I immediately sought out "The Viscount's Bawdy Bargain" too.The heroine & hero are both superbly drawn and enchanting. Their chemistry is apparent, and their relationship marvelous. Lynnette is bold and crafty (in a good way). Ravensfield is intelligent and has a way with words. The bits of suspense add just the right touch to the romance. Delicious reading.

The only thing the title has to do with the story is the hero's nickname, Cupid, earned for his astounding marksmanship. And the cover art is insipid, whereas the story is decidedly substantial.Although criticisms of the heroine's near worship of Lady Anne have some foundation, the criticisms of her attachment to the child do not (or very little at least). Penny has raised the child from birth, after all. But Penny is a very interesting heroine nonetheless, and "Cupid" is a compelling hero.The story has some very dark elements, including the effect of war upon soldiers, the way suspicion and unfounded prejudices can destroy lives, alcoholism, disease, and more. There is a wide variety of great emotional depth here, as well as romance and passion. Fairchild's descriptions created a realism to the setting that is rarely seen.Those unhappy with the book's ending -- one that blended both realism and hope -- should read the next book in the series: Valentine's Change of Heart.A superb book.

Although I usually read historicals, I read contemporaries now and again for variety. After reading this book, I'll be putting SEP on that list. It was witty, and it definitely succeeded at providing a realistic masculine feel to the guys' actions and emotions. It did take Heath a long time to "get it," but he seems like the kind of guy for whom that would be true. Annabelle's family was just too much, and I keep expecting Heath to fall into his old pattern because of them. She suffered realistically from their "help" while still forging her own path. The secondary romance was not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the friendship among the women and the comraderie of the men. The little girl was a hoot! Enjoyable story...not one of my favorites, but quite diverting.

White Heather is a very good book indeed, with interesting and likeable leads, a riveting bit of intrigue, and a delightful love story. One of the most remarkable things about the book is how skillfully the intrigue is woven into the rest of the story. Reding manages to keep the reader just slightly guessing until the very end. Yes, we're pretty sure we know who, but are they in league together? Is one a red herring? Is Robert mistaken in any of it? Perhaps the best mix of intrigue and romance I have read in historical romance. Superbly done.Robert is quite a hero: different and yet embodying all the necessary elements. Catriona is a compelling heroine as well--both smart and idealistic--and so very suited to this man. They truly bring out the best in each other. I am, however, more inclined to agree with Robert than with Catriona about Ian. You knew that was coming, but Reding managed to embue it with power and surprise none the less. That's a hallmark of this book, in fact; Reding takes the usual elements and makes them seem fresh.There are a couple of minor questions left over, but the vast majority is neatly wrapped up, and the reader is left feeling well satisfied. I'll be reading more from this author.

I don't know what I was expecting, but I was in for a surprise.I liked Diana very much, but I thought she was too stubborn on the not marrying. Then again, Christopher never told her he loved her--it took him forever to figure it out. And for someone who was SO concerned about scandal, she sure did court it...and oddly enough, repeatedly recover from it (after having been devasted by it years earlier).I didn't like Christopher as much; he seemed like a user to me. And why did he never make clear his sincerity about marrying her? I also found him a bit domineering. But I loved his place on Cyrene.The mystery was well done, I thought--plenty of pieces kept in play and resolved at the right moment. As for the sex...there was definitely plenty of it. In fact, there was so much, that it got really old, and I found myself groaning, "Again?" This relationship was more about lust than love, in my opinion.

Thoroughly likeable lead characters, two marvelous younger siblings, and a truly interesting mystery. Although there's a time or two that Alex is ovebearing in a seriously negative way, most of the time, he's just wonderful. And Portia is a heroine you can really cheer for. Their relationship is a pleasure to watch.Davenport (Alex's friend) is great here, and the best thing about the next book, A Kiss of Spice. DO read this one first; it will make a difference in your enjoyment of book 2. However, The Tiger's Mistress is a much better book, in large part because I don't care much for The Lady in Red, who becomes the heroine in book 2, and can't really see her with Davenport. Even here, it's a big question mark.DaRif's writing is sharp and her characterizations on the money. Witty and smart. The title is convoluted, but....Great book; 4.8 stars.

First, Olivia's assistant Winslow is a terrific character. One does feel the first book should have been read first; I often wondered what background information I was missing. There are some great moments, especially regarding danger and suspense. Honestly I was more intrigued by secondary characters the Wolfhound and sister Cara than by the romantic leads here. I did like Davenport, a lot, but he seemed much too insecure to make a good mate for Olivia. As for her, I never really warmed up to her. The suspense was quite good, but the romance lacked something for me. I'm interested in the other books, particularly the one I imagine is on tap regarding the Wolfhound and Cara, but I wasn't thrilled by this one. Three 3 1/2 stars.

At times the book was absorbing, but at others, it was dull. The lead couple was not particularly interesting; they weren't awful, but they weren't exceptional in any meaningful way. Too much was said, rather than shown. The mystery remained fairly interesting, although the cast of villains and suspected villains sometimes became confusing and some of them remained enigmas through the end.I always get the feeling that there's something missing in Ms. Hunter's books...some emotional connection for the reader. There's a sense of distance, an invisible wall between the characters and the reader that is never quite breached. This one is no different.

I never really liked the hero much -- that's a very bad thing in any romance. Sebastian did have his good moments, but he was too often a jerk and rarely noble or honorable enough. Prudence was more likeable, but she didn't capture my heart as Medeiros' characters usually do. Secondary character Jamie is a hoot, though.I'm having trouble determining exactly what is lacking in this novel; perhaps it is that Medeiros is one of my favorites and this book isn't up to her usual excellence. Granted, it is an early work, and most writers improve over time, so I perhaps I am being too harsh. If it were another author, I might be more generous, but this is nowhere near Medeiros' best.Approach it as an early, less-than-stellar Medeiros work, and you'll probably enjoy it. Expect something like her more recent books, and you'll be disappointed.

Like most readers, I rather liked Justin, although he sometimes seemed undependable (he had promised her father to take care of her) and a bit wimpy. His musical talent was a delightful characteristic. It seemed odd, however, that he found it so easy to adjust to being a Duke after so many years in New Zealand. Emily is often annoying; she has spirit and strength, but she is immature and mercurial. Their relationship did sometimes have moments of unseemliness, of &quot;ickiness.&quot;The book started well, but dragged later on. The ending left far too many questions still unanswered. As a whole, unsatisfactory. Only Medeiros' ability to write beautifully, to evoke emotion, and to effectively evoke a setting raises this attempt to a three-star level. For plot and characters alone, it's only 2 stars.

For me, there was nothing really special about this book. The lead characters were pleasant and enjoyable, but nothing out of the ordinary. Some of the secondary characters were quite interesting, especially the secondary romance, but they were not developed enough. Sadly, if they had been more developed, they would have overshadowed the romantic leads.The mystery was often interesting, and often provided some of the best-paced sections of the book. At the same time, however, the mystery was exceptional either. The red herring was too obvious, and the villain needed more time and &quot;screen time.&quot;Too often, the author's unfortunate tendencies to massacre pronoun usage, to endlessly repeat a phrase in the dialogue (something that was obviously intended to be amusing, but quickly grew old and flat), and to reuse the same phrases in description and dialogue from novel to novel grated on my nerves. The book's uneven pacing had me checking repeatedly to see how much I had left to read. If I hadn't wanted to see how the curse was broken, I probably would have given up. As it was, I was glad when I'd finished.

Gentle humor, scintillating romance, an engaging child, an even more engaging hero who befriends and encourages said child, a heroine afraid to risk her heart, and a past that haunts the present and may destroy the future. Mix it all together and you have another great read by D'Alessandro. Superior secondary characters add to the charming lead couple and increase the book's interest. Lovely -- no dictionary needed.

An excellent read...sensual, romantic, compelling, agonizing, and intense. McCall's story weaves a superb romance with harrowing personal demons and manipulative, exceedingly dangerous villains. McCall allows to to see Catherine and Gray fall in love, to feel them struggle with their pasts and their fears, to alternately worry and cheer as they face Eduard's manipulations.Superb. Don't pass it up.

After reading a long run of books that needed, at least, better editing for style and grammar, reading Mary Reed McCall (an English teacher in her day job) was a breath of fresh air. How delightful it was not to be pulled out of the story by odd word choices, tortured phrasings, and grammar poor enough to make one shudder. McCall's writing is clear, smooth, and never leaves the reader asking what in the world she meant.The lead characters, Gwynne and Aidan, are resolute, honorable, tortured, and intriguing. McCall shows a real understanding of the true honor and its price. Despite the Fabio-like cover art, Aidan is a strong, sensitive hero who has to choose, or make peace, between love and honor. Gwynne lost her memory 12 years ago, losing her true identity as well. Can she rediscover that woman, that life, and reconcile it to the only life she remembers, that of a warrior?My reason for giving The Maiden Warrior 3 & 1/2 stars is that I simply didn't find it engrossing or thrilling. It was enjoyable and interesting, but not a lot more. I will admit, however, that it could have been the timing of the read, such that real life interfered with my enjoyment of the book. I was holding out huge hopes for a fellow English teacher; she met them gramatically and in most other ways. But for some reason I cannot identify, I wasn't grabbed by the book. I did, however, like it enough to try another of her books.

Although I liked the first book, something about this one was smoother. I'm still not fond of first person, but it worked better here. The twists & turns of the plot heightened the suspense, although there were some too coincidental or too predictable moments. This one provided a number of interesting insights into Bill & his relationship with Sookie -- things that nicely set up future conflicts. Nicely done; fewer annoying and unimportant minor details to wade through, more action. Eric becomes ever more intriguing as well.

I really struggled to get through this one. It seemed to drag to me. I wasn't crazy about either protagonist, and their treatemtn of each other -- especially Stuart's actions -- were often borderline creepy. Too often his manipulation of her strayed from seduction to putting a toe over the line of rape -- only a toe, but enough to be uncomfortable for this reader. Plus, I never really bought their relationship are true love. Although the last scene is lovely, the sholw is slow and surperficial, with a very mediocre sting plot. I'll pass, and I recommend you do as well.

McCabe's Once Upon a Midnight Clear was definitely mediocre. Having a black woman as the romantic heroine in a Regency piece was different certainly (if implausable), but the whole story seemed contrived and the resolution was far too easy.Lane's The Ultimate Magic was very nice. Although the disclosure of confidences was rushed due to the short story format, there were excellent romances and characters with lots of interest to bring it all together.Layton's entry, The Two Dancing Daughters, was contrived as usual. I rarely like her stuff. This one was a trite rehash of a fairytale/folktale. Although the hero was interesting, the heroine was dull.Metzger's The Enchanted Earl was somewhat interesting, perhaps hitting the middle slot of the 5 stories. The ending was too easy; he told her the secret when she should have guessed. A bit of a magical scare thrown in.Heath's The Green Gauze Gown was an embedded fairy tale done right. The characters are well conceived but the youthful actions/beliefs are a bit suspect. Overall, very nice, well done.

It is not necessary to read &quot;The Husband test&quot; first; the events in the first book are only very briefly mentioned. This one stands alone.This one's unusual in that the hero is the one who wants nothing to do with women; he wants to be a monk! But Chloe very much wants to be a wife; alas, she doesn't know her parentage and cannot be one of the Brides of Virtue without that knowledge. So she tricks her way into a group of brides-to-be. She not only has to discover her parentage and find herself a husband, but she also has to decide who the other 4 brides will marry. But the king appoints Sir Hugh to help her, and he begins to have very un-monklike thoughts about her. Their battle of wills is full of humor and struggle.As good if not better than The Husband Test. Delightful.

This book is not so much romance as it is paranormal (vamps & weres) suspense. The romantic relationship between the leads was not particularly potent, except for a scene in which Dain asks Fleur to do something huge for him. The reader who saw Marius' potential relationship as more compelling is probably right.Still as a vamp book and as suspense, it's great. This book kept my interest throughout, and I'm eager to read the next installment of the series. Don't expect a great romance; you won't get it here. But if you like vamp stories and suspense, this will maintain your interest.

In some ways I liked this one better than Lord of Fire; in other ways I liked LoF better. Foley has improved some in her errors & use of modern language in a period setting. There is still some of that, but much less. However, she makes other historical mistakes that pull the reader out of the story. "Silent Night" has already been mentioned. In addition, the phrase "mad as a March hare," while popular in the 1800s predates this story a bit.Damien is not as complex as Lucien (LoF) but Miranda is a livelier heroine than Alice. The difficulty with this book is its uneven character; some parts were excellent while others were slow or less than engaging. The ending, especially Napoleon's return & Waterloo, felt rushed. Damien's war career is so central to this book that such a significant event deserved more attention.So, some good stuff, but flawed.

In Devil Takes a Bride, Foley takes a different tack, and it works beautifully. Lizzie and Devlin become real friends very quickly, and it is sweet and refreshing to see a romance in which you know the protagonists will have a wonderful life together because it is firmly based on friendship as well as romance.Devlin is, in many ways, the kind of man you really would want to spend your life with. Often romance heroes are fun to read about but would be very trying to live with. Dev, while having his share of faults & quirks, is warm, witty, compassionate, and strong in all of the right ways. It takes him until near the very end to abandon his need for vengeance, and that is probably his greatest fault, but in so many other ways, he is the personification of the best of gentlemanly virtues. His journey to falling in love with Lizzie, and realizing that she is worth more than any vengeance, is a beautiful thing. Lizzie is a great heroine, just wanting a place she really belongs. After the last book (Lady of Desire), I was eager to see her well-hitched. She far surpasses her best friend, Jacinda, from LoD.We encounter several members of the Knight family in addition to Jacinda (who is very different from her portrayal in LoD), the best of whom are Lucien and Alec. Lucien is his fabulous self here, and you really see the marvelous inner man who was so surpressed by his covert operations in his book, Lord of Fire. Alec, who was such a jerk in Lady of Desire, still has some growing to do, but his main purpose here is a foil for Devlin. Those two can be hilarious together. Indeed, you'll roll your eyes and growl in frustration along with Lizzie that these two grown men can act like such children.There's laughter, romance, heartache, and some truly sizzling love scenes in this book. Foley has made great strides as a write, and it shows in this effort.

Despite the well-drawn characters and nasty villains, this book dragged somewhat. The interactions between the main characters were spot-on, and the mechaniations of those in power rang true. For me, the emphasis on food and Griffin's overwrought sense of smell got old and repetitious. The rest of the novel was very good, but too many times those (many) portions dealing with food read more like a food magazine than a novel.I would buy the first two, but not this one.

The little Christmas tale, while imperfect, is far better than most holiday Regencies. First, the main couple is older(he's 47, she's 39)--that's a rare treat, and it's very well done. Granted, Beatrice is a bit of a martyr, but it's a sweet romance nonetheless.The two younger couples are different: one young lady is a first-class hoyden and her eventual mate is none too likeable at first. With the second pair, he's a bit of a stick-in-the-mud--very serious--while she's rather delightful in a quiet, well-bred sort of way.One problem with the novel is that the author sometimes forgets what the characters do or do not know and either repeats or contradicts earlier information. Nevertheless, the book is more complicated than many of its ilk and manages to surprise the reader in the last chapter. It takes these couples quite a while to get together, but the wait is generally enjoyable and occasionally engrossing.

The cast of characters in this Regency era novel maintains a high level of interest. After a near-scandal forces her into an arranged marriage without love (one that itself ends in scandal), Lucinda strives to always be all that is proper, allowing not a hint of scandal to touch her or her family name...and then along comes brash American Garrett, who doesn't give a fig for the high-in-the-instep, hypocritical values of high English society. Desire erupts immediately between these two, and Lucinda finds it increasingly difficult to maintain her proper actions around Garrett.Lucinda's motivations are clearly understood by the reader from the very beginning. Garrett, though charming, requires some self-knowledge and change to be truly heroic. He starts off as selfish and bossy. Worse, he simply cannot believe that Lucinda means &quot;No&quot; when she says &quot;No.&quot; He fails to comprehend that she could desire him and yet still truly mean her refusal to act on that desire. Finally, however, he gets a clue; he comes to understand her reasons and begins to feel ashamed of himself (not that he ceases to want her or ceases to try to seduce her), but he is more understanding and begins to see himself and others more clearly. As a result, he does change in some significant ways. In fact, he uses the word &quot;love&quot; first. Moreover, he shows some truly heart-softening vulnerability (though he does so rarely and unwillingly). And Garrett really is deliciously naughty.The tone in this book is rather anti-English, in the &quot;high society is so hypocritical&quot; vein. Although it's a little odd for this sub-genre, it is an interesting point of view. Lucinda herself begins to question all that she's thought was important.The book kept my attention; it was well-paced and good fun. Three &amp; 1/2 stars (mainly becaue Garrett has such a hard time understanding the word &quot;No&quot;).

I actually liked this one better than the first one (A Necessary Husband). Meg (Margaret) was a secondary character in the first book, sister of hero Garrett. She is quite charming, delightful, witty. Her only big flaw is that she's still angry and hurt with her brother about his past choices (to go to sea); it doesn't really work with the past book--at least not until the very end when she finally voices her real fears. Justin is simply a dream--handsome, noble, honorable, mysterious, tender...but with a temper (he yells a lot when he's angry). You can't help but love these two right from the start. It's so obvious how good they'll be for each other.There are some moments of needless repetition and too many &quot;she's/I'm American&quot; excuses (Is there perhaps a lack of understanding of American culture during the period?), but this book is still enchanting, mainly because of the two leads. The mystery which has haunted Justin for years and made him the scourge of society is well-played. The resolution is perhaps a bit too speedy, but as a whole the mystery works.Meg's reasons for refusing Justin's offer of marriage seem silly at first. It takes a long time to discover the truth, in part because it takes her a long time to admit the truth, even to herself. It takes realizing just how much her refusal is hurting all those she cares about--a result of her not really understanding how English society works. once she admits the truth about her fears, she faces them and overcomes them.An excellent read.

Christina Dodd's story is first and, sadly, abysmal. The tale is almost entirely unbelieveable, but perhaps the worst part is that I don't believe they're in love. Dodd does not convince the reader that these two people knew each other well enough before the night of the story to act as they do. I had hopes for it, but it just kept getting worse. The few really nice moments could not counteract the pathetic whole. 1 measley star.Stephanie Laurens' entry is better at 2 1/2 to 3 stars. The raucus house party is a poor device for getting the lovers together, but the two leads make even that work. The story is lovely in places, particularly the dinner scene and at the end (with her brother). It's about a love that's denied through youthful misunderstandings getting a second chance. It's also typical Laurens, with heavy emphasis on sex.Celeste Bradley raises the bar again with her marvelous story about an arrogant, obnoxious hero who finally redeems himself and a fresh, provocative, unique heroine who is the best leading lady of the bunch. There is some incredulity at times that nobody can tell these not-quite-identical twins apart, but the story is still great fun. 4 stars.This is my first experience with Leslie LaFoy, but it won't be my last; hers is the best story in the book (5 stars). Rennick is the epitome of the reformed rack & Julia's his loving but sensible love interest. This is an excellent variation on the typical plot with Julia being an older woman (in her 30s) who was happily married...at least until she met Rennick. They fall instantly in love, but both respect her husband and her marriage vows too much to act on their feelings and attraction. Then hubby dies. But before Rennick gets the chance to sweep her off her feet, she gets engaged to someone else. And her fiance? Gads! This little story has a wealth of wisdom for life in it, too. Superb!Buy the book for the last two stories. They're good enough to make it worthwhile.

In the realm of series romances, Andrea Pickens is one of the top authors. Although the reviewer who lamented the historical errors makes valid points, including the shallowly drawn villain, the book as a whole is far beyond most of the offerings in series romances.The hero and heroine are likeable, unique, and well-developed. The plot rarely hangs, keeping the reader interested throughout. There is a bare hint of passion, keeping this book from being too sweet (or, for that matter, too raunchy as some series romances are). The rather detailed picture of the early days of golf is intriguing as is the athletic hero's struggle to master the sport. He also battles the social stigma of having a trade, an interest he discovers that he shares with the heroine (who herself is frowned upon by society for her abilties and desire to use them).Filled with the realistic developmentment of a romantic relationship, a couple with sufficiently unique characters, and a fresh approach to an old plot (rescuing the family fortunes).

Miranda is a maarvelous heroine -- strong, intelligent, capable, courageous.... I was a bit disappointed in Daniel; from the other books, I had high expectations of both him and the romance. The 4 stars reflects my slight disappointment that my expectations were not met. I'd been waiting for their story.However, other than that, Lee has written another fine book in the series; it meshes well with Jarrod's book, which occurs almost simulataneously (maybe someday I'll reread them in tandem). It's also very romantic, really. Miranda's love for Daniel is blindingly obvious; it just takes him a little longer to admit to the situation.

Eleanor is a confused young lady who doesn't quite know what's wrong and what she can do to fix it. All she knows is that she feels smothered by her overprotective brothers. Valentine is a hardened rake who simply doesn't believe women are worth any effort other than the minimal required for momentary pleasure; he's never really gotten to know a woman and, underneath it all, doesn't believe he'd be good enough if a female worth knowing existed. But as he is forced into Eleanor's company as more than the friend of her brother, they each learn some eye-opening lessons about themselves.It all sounds very good, but the execution is off. The reader never quite connects with Eleanor's emotional needs, and it takes quite a while to warm up to Valentine. Granted, his long time in reforming is more realistic than the romances where the hero suddenly changes his stripes. Plus, he doesn't change entirely: he remains something of a rake; he just devotes all of that "wickedness" to Eleanor. Valentine becomes, over the course of the book, quite likeable. His declaration is really quite wonderful. But Eleanor remains rather flat and never changes more than to understand herself a bit better.The brothers are going to be good characters once they're given the opportunity to shine on their own. Enoch created some excellent dialogue, and there were moments of real humor and a few of heartfelt emotion. The entire story never quite jelled, however. Much of it is due to Eleanor, whose lack of familiarity with the world and desire to go her own way result in some truly stupid choices.I was so looking forward to a new Suzanne Enoch book, but this one wasn't quite up to snuff.

Sinclair's wacky household sets up a basketload of laughs. More importantly, Jo's masquerade as a young man is so well done that it amkes that particular sub-genre seem new, and her cheekiness toward her employer is delightful. The constant fear of being found out adds to the deliciousness of the situation as Sinclair falls in love with his secretary. Said secretarial position allows Jo and Sinclair to get to know each other as friends first. And Sinclair's war injury makes him a wonderfully flawed hero.Very nice indeed!

This book is a very quick read, which is good sinc it runs out of steam toward the end. The lead characters are interesting and wind up being very good for each other. There are some truly wonderful moments between them, such as after the highwaymen attack their carriage. From the beginning, you know they are making poor decisions that will harm each other, but you understand why and sympathize. The tale looses much of its power after they arrive in Wales -- not immediately, although I expected more emotion when the truth came out, but soon thereafter. Brenn's efforts to regain Tess' love (mainly her bed) are simply not enough to turn things around. Once they're dealing with the aftermath of their deceit, there's little depth of feeling or passion. It's like Maxwell didn't know what to do from there, and it all was resolved much too easily. The result is a love that, at the end of the book, doesn't always seem authentic.Other problems include less than satisfactory secondary characters and far too many plot points never being resolved. What happened to Tess' friends? Her brother got away with embezzlement; where's the justice? And, sorry, but I just cannot believe that Tess' silver was worth nearly 50,000 pounds!Up until the last 1/4 of the book, it's lovely. But the reader is left unfulfilled and much of the story remains incomplete. Pity. Married in Haste would have been significantly better if Maxwell had not finished in haste.BTW, Tess' friend Anne is the heroine of my favorite Maxwell book, The Marriage Contract.

Very few flaws mar London's final book in the Rogues of Regent Street trilogy -- only the unlikelihood that Arthur would turn his back on everything, but he (the "sentimental fool") makes it plausible even so. He's one of those men who is directionless for most of his life, but suddenly stumbles upon that direction when he meets Kerry and realizes that she is the key to all that's been missing.Kerry is a well-developed heroine, strong and giving, but somewhat too trusting at first and one who realizes she does need help sometimes. She and Arthur make a great pair, and London provides both emotional and sensual scenes for them. Their individual despair invades the reader's heart and makes us weep and worry for them. Not only do all the Rogues and their wives make appearances, but the epilogue neatly ties the bow ont he whole package, linking the three books and bringing the series to a satisfying conclusion. Remarkably well done.

At first, I thought this book would be a really well-crafted Regency....that impression didn't last.I thought the murder mystery was interesting even though some of the characters were obviously there for nothing more than plot devices. Some of the characters are interesting but are not quite right for the story. For example, the hero, Adam, is left in charge of the murder investigation, but he knows nothing about how to go about it even though he's a spy. Well, it gives the Russian prince a reason to be there....but that seriously dilutes the hero's strength. Elizabeth is an interesting heroine, and she and Adam do have some chemistry. There were enough potential villains to keep the mystery going; the main problem was Adam's recurring inability to handle it himself. It made him weak; he didn't even get the chance to save the heroine.So....okay, better than most series Regencies, but could have been so much better. 2 &amp; 3/4 stars

Beard triumphs in this well-constructed and touching tale. The hero and heroine are well-rounded and beautifully developed. Any woman who's had to or is reassessing her life will immediately relate to Olivia. Her courage is inspiring. And the hero is everything such a woman could dream of. Theirs is a powerful story of unexpected love and passion in spite of the strictures of society and differences in age and social rank.In addition to the wonderful love story, one that had me wondering how Beard would manage to come up with a happy ending, there are a number of wholly satisfying subplots, including a secondary love story that parallels Olivia's discoveries about love and life and a who-done-it murder mystery with plenty of red herrings, possible suspects, and titillating clues. On top of all this are penetrating looks at social mores, societal ills, and personal foibles, dreams, and heartaches. The doubts, joys, and anguish experienced by the characters ring true, allowing the book to do what the best literature should do: question ourselves and the world around us, reevaluating what we believe and how we live.&quot;The Duchess' Lover&quot; is a riveting book that should be on everyone's to-be-read list, reminding us that real love truly is the most important thing. This is probably a book that needs to be read periodically, just to remember all these things when the tyranny of the urgent and the expectations of others begin weighing us down.

Reviews on this book seem to be all over the place; I really liked it. The reparte was particularly witty, and the lead couple well-drawn characters. Lydia turned out to be the more aloof of the two -- also very intelligent, opinionated, courageous, and determined. Vere had definitely met his match. He, as it runs out, is in reality a bit of a softy, and becomes an exceptionally fine husband -- kind, attentive, romantic (his keepsake box), he really "gets" her and repsects her, but still enough mystery and rougishness to remain interesting and fun. His gift for her was utterly perfect -- swoon worthy. His series of pet (and not always supportive) names for her were quite amusing, as was the way she dealt with his stubbornness.Serious issues like death, prostitution, kidnapping, etc. were dealt with sensitively and with appropriate amounts of both compassion and righteous indignation. While the story does slow a bit in the second half, I didn't find it serious. Indeed, loose ends begin to unravel and threaten to destroy everything. But, of course, in the end, they make everything right -- or nearly so. Chase manages to leave a tiny bit of realistic untidiness.

This book sounded so wonderful--and indeed, Julian is wonderful. I love his quiet, enigmatic, never-ruffled demeanor hides such depth. Sigh. That he loved Pen so devotedly for so long... But I was never quite sure why he never declared himself before she married. Maybe I just don't remember.Pen on the other hand... I just was never crazy about her. I thought she took Julian for granted and was very blind regarding his feelings for her (yes, he did a great job of hiding them, but I thought she should have sensed something, especially after they'd been intimate).The story is often very dark--not something I expected. But I loved Julian's mental letters to people. Overall though, I expected more.

Both of the stories included here fit the above description. The lead characters, especially the vampires, are conflicted about their desires and choices and how those will affect others. The author does not shy away from talk of God, angels, damnation, etc., and it makes for a much more interesting read that the usual stuff. One reviewer in the book called the ending of Forever & the Night "bittersweet." I worried about that through the whole book, only to find it inaccurate. Pay no attention.Miller's vampire world is gloriously detailed, with a well thought out history, compelling and well-defined characters in both lead and supporting roles, and just enough doubt as to the outcome to retain reader interest. I look forward to seeing them all again, especially Valerian. Superior writing.The only thing I have against these stories is that Miller tends to wrap things up too quickly, leaving the resolution not quite realistic. Also, I really would have liked to know more about Aidan & Maeve's no-longer-existant sibling relationship. These two things drop the work to 4.5 stars.

The first story, The Vampire Viscount, is very well done with a few minor, but nice twists on vamps. Harbaugh creates good characters in Nicholas and Leonore and a very good romance. It's not perfect but it's something different, has some excellent moments, and is a nice read. Three stars.The Devil's Bargain is not as good -- its devil and angel "bargain" is trite and takes away from the storyline. Although Eveline's great, you sometimes don't know whether or not to like Richard. One and 1/2 to two stars.

Her For Love or Country was a marvel, and this one is just as readable, though entirely different. Roman and Shanna are great characters, and Sparks has developed them fully with both subtle hints and obvious declarations. Sparks writes both laugh-out-loud funny and quietly poignant scenes. The reader really believes in this couple's love, Roman's past, and Shanna's danger. Secondary characters are much more than window dressing, and the world Sparks has created for the vamps is realistic but "normal." Very, very likeable story!

Edward needs to go back to spy training; he can't be much of a spy to have missed so many obvious questions and dangers. But he's very honorable, refusing to break his almost engagement to Fiona even though he falls for Maggie.I liked Maggie's occasional outbursts of thinking out loud, but she could also be quite manipulative. It took me a long time to warm up to her, and even at the end, I liked her sister Rebecca better. I really liked Fiona, too.Much of it seemed to contrived to me. It was an okay book, but I was a bit disappointed in it. Unmasking the traitor was pretty good though (except for Edward's poor spying and the ever-annoying heroine taking off without telling anyone). I found the book average; maybe 3.2 stars.

I liked Tipton better than Keanan, although he's okay. But I like Wynne much better than I had Devona. Actually, I love Tipton in this story, too.The back cover is to be ignored. There's no "lesson" involved. But it is a good story with plenty of passion. The subplot of the half-brothers is well done, although I tire of the having the hero's mother be utterly horrid. Will there be a book for Nevin? He's an interesting character.As far as the series goes, this one falls somewhere in the middle, being better than the third one.

What's to like? Celta & all that involves, appearances by T'Ash & Danith and Ailim & Ruis (from previous novels), heartbreaking moments, especially with Holm (not giving anything away here), the kittens.Problems: Where's the charismatic Holm we came to love in the first 2 books? I had a little trouble believing he was so inept with Lark (and only Lark). Lark is a bit annoying at times because she refuses to see past Holm's status as a fighter; it's opposed to her status as a Healer. Lark's Heartgift just doesn't seem to fit the rules; I hated it; it didn't even use her creative gift which seems to be a requirement of sorts. The bittersweet ending. Saying much more would harm one's enjoyment of the story by taking away the suspense, but I hope that the next book (or 2) addresses that which still causes my heart to ache. These problems dropped the rating to 4 stars.Not as good as #2, but still a wonderful effort by Ms. Owens. She's on my automatic buy list (and it's a VERY small list).

Kaplan's book hits the high points of history but rarely goes into detail. It's format is comparative, a back-and-forth examination of various cultures. The layout is visually appealing, making it easy to read and study. Chapter review questions have well explained answers.If you're looking for a review book that is more of a memory jogger, this could be the one for you. If you're wanting a complete, in-depth, review, look elsewhere.

Like most other reviewers, Jo Beverley's &quot;The Lord of Elphindale&quot; was not my favorite, but with Beverley, even one of her poorer offerings is much richer than the best of many other writers. Drew does act like a jerk much of the time and the story would be better for more insight into his reasons. Nevertheless, there are some quite wonderful moments in the story and Gwen is an excellent heroine.&quot;The Faery Braid&quot; by Karen Harbaugh is a take-off on Rapunzel. It is on the low end of the scale as well, primarily because it moves slowly and relies perhaps too much on the narrator. Nevertheless, there are wonderfully poignant moments and a fully realized ending.&quot;The Love Talker&quot; by Barbara Samuel was definitely my favorite. We meet Galen ealier, but this is his story and is so beatifully done. The emotions and characterizations here are real and vivid. Perfectly delightful and worthy of 5 stars.&quot;Dangerous Gifts&quot; by Mary Jo Putney is refreshing in its less-than-gorgeous romantic leads and carries a message within the tale. It is marvelously written, though it failed to tug at my emotions as the previous story did. Actually, the faeries in this tale may be more engaging characters than the human romantic leads.

A Suspicious Affair and An Angel for the Earl are both amusing and relatively entertaining, the second entry being the better of the two. "Angel" is innovative and the lead couple likeable and fairly well rounded. Metzger's typical humor is in force in both works, though perhaps more so in the first. While the puns are sometimes trite, the word play and mental twists usually work. The problem with "Affair" is that both leads are unpleasant for quite some time and the sudden declaration is not wholly believeable. Both can drag when Metzger's exposition lengthens.This book combines two average Metzger novels. Thus, while diverting, it's not going to account for any money spent on my part.

Not having read the previous books was a detriment. So many events from the past are referred to that this reader had a tough time following current events. it was about the middle of the novel before the pieces started falling into place, and even then, I often wished I had all that background knowledge.The book had a number of good qualities, however, including the strong leading characters. Amara's subservience to her nasty family was irritating, but her heart was so good and her past so painful that you really rooted for her to have a wonderful life with someone like Brock who would cherish her. Brock is a flawed man, but he has exactly the qualities that Amara needs. Their long, difficult road to happiness is most fulfilling.This story is darker than many Regency era romances, reminding me a lot of Jo Beverley. Although some of the obstacles are more unfulfilled nuisance than real problems--like Amara's cousin--this story features several episodes of true unplesantness and downright violence. These, in fact, are the things that both separate the lovers and bring them together.Had I read the earlier books first, I'd have enjoyed this book more and rated it higher. I will read more from Barbara Pierce, however.

Jo Beverley doesn't shy away from unpleasantness; that means that her work is not everyone's cup of tea. In this book, the brutality, misconceptions, and chauvinism of the early Middle Ages are clearly woven into the characters and the storyline. Hence, Imogen's sheltered existence and overreliance on an unworthy spiritual advisor, as well as FitzRoger's clear understanding of what he must do to succeed in that world. He does what is necessary even when he would rather not; his practicality is a necessary and welcome compliment to Imogen's more idealistic view.While Imogen is an innocent, and often makes foolish mistakes as a result of her lack of experience, she shows a good deal of growth at the book's end. FitzRoger's phobia is an interesting problem for a warrior and makes him more human. He handles Imogen's fears are handled with great patience and tenderness.The villains in this piece are truly vile, though in varying ways, and the good guys wear slightly gray hats (helms). Beverley creates more complex characters than a number of writers, in part because she willingly delves into the darker side of human nature. Those uncomfortable with reading about that darker nature might want to avoid this book (and most of her books). FitzRoger is perhaps a stronger character than Imogen, and her &quot;gift&quot; seemed a bit too coincidental, but otherwise the book is well-written and engaging.

I gave it 3 stars, but it's really more like 3.5 stars. I did not feel justified in giving it 4. It's an interesting twist on the plot, and the characters are likeable enough. It is a bit light in the romance department, sometimes slow, and the resolution of the young niece too easy. Still it's pleasant and interesting enough to be recommended for a light read and to consider reading this author again.

The Pleasure Seekers is difficult to pin down; it's at once tragic and hopeful. Caine is perhaps the most tragic hero I have yet to encounter. He was truly a lost soul, so incredibly tortured, much of it a torture of himself from guilt and feelings of unworthiness. One almost has to wonder how Bliss was able to see beneath his extremely angry, sometimes violent, always challenging outer self to the deeply scarred, painfully alone, nearly broken man inside. George has created in Caine one of the most memorable romantic leads I've ever read. From the very beginning, the reader hurts for him; even when you cannot sanction his actions, you feel his despair. It is extremely powerful.Bliss is not as fully realized. There seems little to her love for him other than desire, pity, and compassion. She's just not as real or as emotionally compelling as Caine. Only her ability to see deep inside him, and to love and forgive that inner man, makes her a worthy companion.Some elements of the plot are defintely too quickly resolved, such as the horse and the murder, and Olivia is a one-note character, although there is certainly plenty to loathe. The reader must be happy that poor Caine has found peace and love, but this is not a comfortable story. Caine too often gets close to rape and Olivia's treatment of him is even worse. But it is also a story of redemption...no, salvation. It's a pity that Bliss is not his equal, except in the largeness of her heart, and that the other plot elements are not given their due.Caine's a 4 & 1/2 star character...the rest is more 3 stars.

Ms. George is a good writer. It's that simple. Lucien is a terrific, tortured hero. Fancy is headstrong and determined, but vulnerable. They make a terrific pair. The story maintains its tension and the reader's interest throughout, and meanwhile does a superb job of setting up the next book, making the reader pine for its release. George also writes very hot love scenes.My only concern is that I didn't always buy into the angst. Fancy's withdrawal from Lucien when she found out how her brother died seemed extreme after what she already knew, not so much that it happened, but that it took so long for her to forgive (under the circumstances). Lucien's actions sometimes seemed to contradict his beliefs; worse, he continued with his revenge for no reason that to continue. But these minor qualms and only drop my rating a a few tenths of a star.All in all, a great read and a definite keeper. Somewhere around 4.4-4.5 stars.

On the cover, Julia London is quoted as saying, "If you love Friends, you will love Romantic Fiction." I never really cared for Friends and saw less than a handful of episodes. But I found this book amusing. In fact, I laughed so hard at one point, that others began to wonder about my sanity.That does not mean this is a perfect book. It is sometimes repetitive or slow, and there are several times that the reader isn't crazy about the characters. Though bordering on stereotypical, the characters work together to present an amusing group. Moreoever, they still come across as real, flawed people -- in this case, adults who haven't quite grown up yet, but mature during the course of the story. The story is more about friendships than about romantic love, but it does deal with the issue of fantasy versus reality. Tom will never be the "romantic fiction" hero that Lucy dreams of, but he loves her, quirky, emotional, and high maintenance though she is. But as they each recognize their flaws and seek to be more mature and understanding with each other, true love emerges.If you're looking for a highly romantic story, look elsewhere. If a quirky group of friends, just shy of questionable mental stability, who really care about each other despite their differences, and a strange but somehow honest romantic relationship sound interesting -- despite the occasional playful sleeziness -- then give this one a try. It might be that something different you're looking for. I'm giving it 4 stars to indicate the between 3 & 4 nature of the book and the review.

Not the best stories I've ever read, certainly. Simpson's "Wild Honey" is the worst of the lot with ridiculous names, an unbelieveable heroine, and a very thin plot. Although the premise of Holbrook's "A Valentine Dream" is silly, her main characters are strong leads; it's the secondary characters and the "dream" that wreck havoc. Raleigh's "The Merry Cupids" is the best of the three, thanks to the strong, better developed romantic leads and a plausible plot.If you're looking for something light and don't mind the silliness, this book might be worth a few hours of your time. But if you're looking for something more substantial or a higher quality of writing (especially as concerns the two stories mentioned first), then look elsewhere.

Each section provides definitions, examples, and explanations to make all the basics, and then some, understandable. There's plenty here, including grammar, literature, and vocabulary--even a nice listing of Greek & Latin root words and affixes. The sample questions & answers are a good study tool as well. A very nice reference for teachers and LA students as well as those taking Regents.

Very funny with an unusual heroine and plenty of atmosphere. My reason for not rating it at 5 stars is primarily it's unbelieveable premise and resolution. The heir to a dukedom marrying a trick horse rider? Sure. Nevertheless, Alex's totally priggishness matched with Mary's say-and-do-anything openness is ready-made for laughs galore. Britton's earthy sense of humor gets a real workout here. Still Britton manages some poignancy with Mary's feelings of inadequacy.The other area of discord (apart from the unlikeliness of the pairing and the unbelieveableness of Alex's willingness to give up everything, including any sort of livelihood, for her) is Alex's daughter; she serves merely as a way to get Mary into, and back into, Alex's life. The brat has no other usefulness.If I could give 3 &amp; 1/2 stars, I would. But Britton's LOL humor and unusual heroine force me into giving this book 4 stars.

Verity is a heroine who discovers her inner strength, stops being a doormat, gives generously of herself to those around her, and discovers that she's okay after all.James is a tormented hero who acts like a &quot;monster&quot; because of an overabundance of shame &amp; guilt. But beneath all that, he is so honorable &amp; noble, that Verity stays in his home for 8 months with only 1 incident, one that dumps another boatload of guilt on James &amp; more esteem issues on Verity. Along the way, however, they become real friends, which is the best basis for any relationship. The romantic feelings are buried because of their situations. When they finally come to light, their strength has healed not only James &amp; Verity, but the entire community.Although I had a good idea who the villain was, there were enough red herrings to keep it interesting. My only complaint is that there should have been surviving witnesses to the villain's admission of guilt and to James' situation.This story is not primarily about lust or seduction, nor does it heavily rely on such elements. Instead, it's about two hurting people who grow, and heal, and find abiding friendship and true love. The attraction is there; it just doesn't dominate the story or the characters.The Cornish dialect was sometimes hard to decipher, but it added greatly to the setting and tone. Enjoy!

Often laugh-out-loud funny, this book also contains a lot of heart. poor Joy just can't seem to control her magic, which makes for a happy, laughing reader and a furious duke. Alec is so staid and proper, so concerned about even a minor scandal -- and he unknowingly marries a witch, a very clumsy one. Sometimes Alec is verbally cruel to her, but it comes from his upbringing and generations of Duke's just like her starts this novel -- wow, do things change by the end. Joy's natural optimism keeps her from giving up early in their relationship. But who can resist all those pink rose petals? Oh, my goodness. A delightful paranormal that is emotionally satisfying without taking itself too seriously.

From all the reviews, I expected Dreaming to be a fabulous book. It was good, but certainly not fabulous. Letitia (Letty) really has a penchant for disaster, but she is so honest and vulnerable that one often wants to weep on her behalf. Truly, her loneliness and devastation -- and her courage and faith in the midst of them -- touch the heart very, very deeply. Letty's string of disasters would have been completely off-putting if not for her palpable neediness. This was the best part of the book, the reader's emotional empathy for Letty. Richard is lonely, too, but his way of dealing with it is not nearly so sympathetic. He can be a real cad, and his hurting her to save her is just plain painful. His love for her does not ring true until the final danger, but that is a really wonderful scene.The secondary romance had real possibilities, but happened so quickly that little came of it. The smugglers and pirates were welcome secondary characters, but the MacLean didn't function as well in this book as in Bewitching. It's a decent book, and Letty is a memorable heroine, but often the story was very slow and I didn't think it was as amusing as Bewitching. All in all, it's merely better than average.

This book should have come second in the series. Read it after Once a Mistress; the second book occurs much later in time and this one finishes explaining all that took place in that first book.Kit is SO sweet; what a wonderful young man! (Cakes--you'll understand when you read it) I'd let him marry my daughter. Mariah is also sweet, and innocent, and together they make, perhaps, the nicest couple in the genre. There's wit and heart and heartache here, and it all blends together extremely well. The minor mystery centers around the death of Mariah's mother; the villain is truly villanous, but he is dispatched too easily.There are a few niggling errors, like &quot;Here, here!&quot; instead of Hear, hear!&quot; But all in all, it's a delightful book. Very heart-warming.

Millicent and Chandler are well-developed, likeable characters who carry the uneven plot and writing of this book higher than it would otherwise be. Although Millicent easily loses her head around Chandler, their attraction is realistically portrayed and is a strong element of the book. Chandler's realization that he has finally grown up and truly wants to settle down is given the perfect touch.On the other hand, the author includes characters and situations that seem to have little real purpose and, therefore, become distracting. For example, the appearance of Chandler's old mistress is nothing more than an obvious occasion for jealousy and doubt. Millicent's work as a gossip columnist should have created more tension in her relationship with Chandler. The gentleman is also supposed to be "obsessed" with finding the thief, but he seems only interested. Such things add up to wasted potential for additional conflict. In addition, there are a large number of typographical errors, and the ending is, frankly, lame. It does not carry the intensity of attraction that the rest of their relationship does.I usually enjoyed the book a great deal, but it wasn't of the highest quality. Had Chandler and Millicent not been such good characters and their relationship not been such a strong element, I would have had to rate it lower. It's a 3 & 1/2 star read.

I actually groaned when I realized the historical setting for this book -- not my usual choice. But, since I was ready for something different, I dived in. I'm very glad I did.Feather has created a thoroughly convincing setting, ripe with historical detail and enough actual fact to make the reader buy the whole without difficulty. Owen is a thoroughly fascinating hero -- so deliciously yummy! And tortured, too. Pen is a complex character, a woman dealing with a great deal of pain and understandable resentment. Only Owen is able to break through that to the warm woman she once was. Political intrigue, dangerous alliances, spies and plots, and a conniving set of in-laws mix with the romance to yield a truly engrossing book.While Feather isn't my favorite author, I do like her for something different. This book was just the thing. If possible, I'd rate it 3.8 stars. I'll be reading the rest of this set.

While not as good as Kissed by a Spy, it's not bad. It presents the intrigue and danger of 16th century England in an absorbing way. Pen is a great character, but I'll agree that Lionel is a mixed bag as a hero. He never becomes quite heroic enough. Most people have a problem with Lionel's part in Pen's repeated, drugged rape; it is a terrible offense, but like most fallible humans, he thought at the time that his restraint was for a a good cause. In the end, had he not stood by, he would not have been around to rescue her. Not pleasant, granted.This book is not as complete, as fulfilling, as its predecessor. The secondary romance is brushed over (Robin did deserve his own book), and many details are not fleshed out enough.

At least the editors make no bones about their strictly leftist leanings. And the included articles are sure to spark heated debate. But that's about all that can be praised about this book. Nearly every article manages to lambast significant aspects of American society, such as capitalism, all in the name of &quot;democracy.&quot; In line with most teacher preparation courses, this book toes the politically-correct educational doctrines: school choice is always bad (unless you're sending your own child there), the wealthy and the corporations are always evil, anything English or related to white males is suspect, and everything done or proposed by a conservative comes from a mean-spirited motive that seeks to keep all others under their heel. In addition to such blatant one-sidedness, the occasional valid points are buried beneath an overwhelming mound of negativism. Reading this book--if one can actually manage to get through it without tossing it in the garbage or wishing for an early death to end the misery--is draining, boring, and ultimately unhelpful. The &quot;critical&quot; in the title seems to refer to the authors' mindsets more than to the issues. My education class members despised this book quite vocally--and most of them were fairly liberal in their politics and educational perspectives.If you're looking for a book that thickly lays on the liberal perspectives on social issues and seeks to blame every ill on &quot;the Right,&quot; look no further. However, if you want a balanced look at issues where both sides are given their due, look elsewhere. This book isn't worth 45 cents, mubh less $45.

Gareth &amp; Margery are engaging characters with both vices &amp; virtues. Gareth's visions are a predictable fault for this sub-genre as is his hatred of her brothers, but Callen handles it well and makes him more than those cookie-cutter features would indicate. His nobility &amp; honor intrigue. Margery manages to be both independent &amp; needy, reckless &amp; responsible. She's a strong character who makes a good match for this knight.The love story remains interesting, even though the lead characters are sometimes so stubborn you want to smack some sense into them. And the last 1/3 of the book, especially the ending is sweet &amp; lovely &amp; very romantic. There's no true villain in the piece; it's primarily a love story and needs nothing else to bolster it.

I expected a lot from this book because I happened to read the sequel (His Scandal) first. Loved that book, but this one is much less...well, it's just less. Less romance, less intriguing characters, less action and intrigue (which is bad considering Spencer is a spy who's life is in danger), less sensuality, less humor....just less.Rose is, frankly, a strong but rather boring heroine. Spencer isn't all that exciting either. He has his moments, but brother Alex (His Scandal) is so much more...heroic.The plot just never really went anywhere. It seemed repetitious and slow. Just skip this one and go on to His Scandal.

Really 3 and 1/2 stars is more accurate; I can't rate it 4, because it's not as good as The Imposter. I was hesitant to read this one because I couldn't see the maid as an appropriate heroine. She is, in fact, a very strong character...perhaps too strong for Collis, as it turns out. The angst is minimal; it should be greater considering the class differences and Collis' disability.The plot is interesting, but there are no surprises and few real thrills. Much of the humor comes from the Prince Regent, who has a big role. The book almost feels as though Bradley needed a third book, and Collis and Rose were the only leads she could come up with, so she tried to make it work--to questionable success.I enjoyed the book; it's just nowhere near the quality of the first two. The historical accuracy isn't there either, and it often sounds too modern. Ethan Damont is a very interesting character and could make a nice hero; he's perfectly set for redemption.

Zarek is the epitome of the tortured hero rescued by love. You cannot help but love the poor man, and he certainly needs all the love and understanading he can get.Astrid is unusual and strong enough to complement him, but Zarek definitely steals the show. Minor character Simi is a treat as well, and Zarek's boss, Acheron, is most interesting, too. I'd love more on him.There are references to prior books, though I've not yet read those. Nevertheless, Kenyon creates a unique world: modern but intimately connected to past cultures (especially ancient Grrece and Rome). The humor is delightful, making use of gags and one-liners featuring popular culture ala Farscape. I did find all the quotes from &quot;The Little Prince&quot; a bit annoying, even though they relate to the romance.At the end of chapter one, I thought, &quot;I'm not terribly impressed.&quot; Before I knew it, I was at the end of chapter 4 and enjoying myself immensely. The action is nearly non-stop, and the plot weaves so many disparate elements that the reader is never lulled into complacency--you may get a little lost once in a while, but you quickly recover. The novel is fast-paced and a quick read, except during the flashbacks of Zarek's long life, which need to be taken slowly because of their emotional impact.Excellent paranormal romance. But skip the short story at the end; it's nothing special.

I am agog after just finishing this book. For me, it rates up there with Mary Balogh's A Summer to Remember. Val & Elaine are marvelous characters who slowly fall in love...captivating, heart-rending, mesmerizing, and oh-so-romantic.I enjoyed Captain Cupid calls the shots, but this one is infinitely better, to my mind. Fairchild's writing is superb. Her detailed descriptions of the settings make the reader feel she's actually there, hearing the roar of the sea, gazing at the mountains reflected in the lake, watching the birds, climbing the castle ruins, feeling the breeze in one's hair or the grass under one's feet. Some might be put off by the slower pace and the extensive use of character's thoughts, but they are perfectly in keeping with the deep introspection of the lead characters. This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful and moving romances I've ever read.As other have noted, the only fault is the brevity of their reunion and reconciliation at the end; I wish Fairchild had done more with it. Note that the blurb on the back cover is somewhat misleading.This is a book that will haunt me for some time, and one I will read on a regular basis. It was so wonderful, I'm tempted to start it again immediately.

I debated whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars; it falls somewhere in between. But I decided that it's closer to 5 stars for Reggie's realistic struggles overcoming alcoholism and Alys' maturity and strength of character. There are some exceptionally well-done emotional moments, plenty of deep character analysis, real character change, and a heartfelt romance. It hits almost all the right notes and leaves the reader feeling not only happy (as all romances should) but also empowered. A must read.

I really wanted to like this book, but the quality is so uneven -- from miserable to splendid -- that each story must be considered individually.The first, by Cathy Maxwell, was so bad that I'd like to give it no stars. This is the first thing I've read by her and I certainly hope she normally writes better. The characters were poorly developed; she really didn't deal with the age difference; and the entire story was superficial. As a reader, I felt only 1-2 moments of empathy with the characters. The idea of a new doctor and a governess was excellent, but the warm and wise doctor was very foolish with regard to his uncle and cousin and to falling in "love" at first sight. The way in which he gains his uncle's favor was highly predictable. And how on earth did he learn to dance, especially all the steps of the quadrille, in only a few days? The real kicker, though, was Maxwell's use of "tone deaf" as explaining the hero's inability to dance. Dancing is about rhythm, not pitch (which applies to tone deafness). Tone deaf people can dance but not sing. Frankly, even people who can sing beautifully may not be able to dance, since it involves a physical use of rhythm. 1 star.Lauren Royal's story fairs somewhat better. I am not as familiar with this historical period (the 1660s) and so cannot say how accurate it is, especially regarding social conventions. However, the time period seems to have little to do with the actual story other than an irrelevant song. The hero is pleasant but superficial; the heroine seemed deeper but we are given few details; the child is adorable. Evidently, these characters were introduced in other books and may be more fully developed there. However, someone just reading this story will be left wanting to learn more about them. The age differences are dealt with in a minor but realistic way. 2 & 1/2 stars.At least each story is better than the last. The third, by Jaclyn Reding, uses a welcome twist on the age issue: she must marry a younger man or face dire consequences, and the hero and her lifelong love is not younger. The characters are engaging, and there are nice historical touches in which the setting provides additional flavor. The reader gets a better sense of Scotland in this tale than in the last which relied too heavily on the Scottish dialect. 3 & 1/2, maybe 4, stars.Definitely saving the best for last with Jo Beverley's novella. This is JB at her best, covering all the bases necessary for an excellent romance. This work is the first of her Georges series (a corollary to the Company of Rogues series). I just happened to read them in reverse order, but it would benefit the reader to read them in the correct order with this one first. Van really stays with you, poor man, and the heroine saves him, quite literally. They are indeed just what the other needs.If you buy this book, buy it for Beverley's novella alone. Otherwise borrow it from the library and read her story. 5 stars! Better yet, get "Three Heroes" & have the stories of all three Georges in one book.Averaging the individual scores, the book as a whole comes out to 3 stars.

Ms. Metzger was "on it" with this one. Wynn is delicious and Torrie is a perfect foil for him. Lots of humor, some interesting subplots, and a happy, loving family along with the despicable one. It's a delight to watch Wynn change from a man totally against marriage and society into a man who cannot imagine his life with this woman. Torrie is strong and kind, but wrestles with snap judgements that tempt her to turn away from Wynn--very human, but she has a good heart and quickly realizes that she's not being fair. Very tame physically, but you hardly miss it. Enjoy!

This is book that explores the insecurities of its characters; I happen to appreciate that, but not all readers do. It also illustrates how the right person can not only help you rise above those insecurities, but also bring out your strong points. That's what good, healthy relationships are all about.Sometimes those inner doubts and emotions were repeated too often, and there were some other minor things that occasionally caused the pacing to drag. Otherwise it is an excellent book with characters you care about. The story never loses its focus on the romantic leads, but it also presents interesting secondary characters. I'm already eager to read Brahm's story whenever that appears.

These two characters are wonderful: Aidan is a very interesting man, who really needs a good wife; Anne is ordinary but full of inner strength and ability just waiting to be used. When he first learns of his proxy marriage, Aidan is a jerk because he does not want to marry, but he eventually succumbs to teh capable and warm-hearted woman who is his wife. Anne quickly becomes a force to be reckoned with, and the whole village becomes the stage for a battle of the sexes.This book is more about two people coming to know and love each other, and for that reason, it touches the heart. The villain of the piece is a bit obvious, but other characters surprise you.Sweet and touching, and well worth the read.

Lucien IS wickedly witty and an impressive seducer. It's refreshing for the man to realize he wants a permanent commitment first; Lucien keeps after Alexandra until she finally acquieses. How on earth could she resist so long? Her refusals did get old and seemed to be based on flimsy reasoning. She's okay as a heroine, but not nearly as strong a character as Lucien. Frankly, she deserved being kidnapped.Aunt Fiona is a woman worth getting angry with, but Rose is generally annoying. What Lucien's best friend sees in her is still beyond me. Characters who show up in later novels, like Emma Grenville, are a welcome addition. FYI, &quot;With This Ring&quot; nad &quot;Lessons in Love&quot; series reference the same characters.

This book is so difficult for me to review. I liked some things very much while others left me cold. Circe is definitely an unusual heroine; her outspokenness and greater-than-her-age wisdom are refreshing. David is sometimes annoying as a man is doesn't know who he wants to be, though he has certainly gorwn up since his brief appearance in Dear Imposter. His mother is an awful woman. It's wonderful to see Psyche and Gabriel again (from Dear Imposter); they play significant roles. And that novel's secondary character Sally makes her presence here as a secondary heroine, her romance almost as important as Circe's. Her beau is delightful, and their romance sweet. The epilogue is perfection.Unfortunately, the action/mystery lacks conviction and often detracts from the rest of the book. As a result, the book is uneven and does not hold the reader's attention as well as its predecessor.

Cord and Victoria are very strong protagonists. Cord's highhandedness and inability to believe Victoria's fidelity can be grating, but Victoria's mistakes, delays, manipulations, and early decision not to trust him with the truth are part of the reasons for Cord's behavior. Their chemistry and "rightness" ares not always convincing, and that's the reason for 4 stars.Sister Claire is beautifully rendered, as well, and her secondary plot is a fine addition to the whole. Initially, I was annoyed by the unsuccessful attempts to free cousin Ethan, but in the end it all worked together admirably. The necklace plot was beautifully handled and perfectly resolved. The set-up for the next book is quite good as well, and I hope Rafe gets a chance later.

I found plenty of emotional depth to enjoy in this effort by Smith. The way Lilith and Gabriel were torn and kept apart resonated with me. Their chemistry is undeniable, and their struggles to compromise and find a way to be together (or to leave each other) are tense, emotional, and realistic. Their inner struggles to thrive despite the pain they have inadvertently caused each other pulls the reader into their lives. Their pain, resentment, and longing are palpable.I found this second chance at love story compelling.

Not so many laughs here, but more character development for Sinclair, and more development of the romance. The small misses (like a different attitude about the Mall of America than in book 1) had no real effect on this reader's enjoyment of the book. Less earthy than the first, and perhaps not quite as tight, but still delightful and fun. Maybe 4.85 stars. Betsy does nearly become, as she herself states, too stupid to live, but she's always been a flighty character -- that's been part of her charm. A shoe-crazy bimbo as queen of the vampires! The big pull here is the better use of Sinclair and the furtherance of the romance. Nice.

Izzy is a great heroine; very realistic in her wistfulness and charming in her easy acceptance of so many awkward situations and her lack of pretension. No wonder Julian finds her a breath of fresh air. And Julian? He buys a horse during their faux engagement just because...and then is disappointed just because she's already outside when he arrives with it (disappointed because he was so looking forward to the surprise). Then toward the end, he says, &quot;Why don't you love me, Izzy?&quot; If you had the same reaction to that question as I did, you'll love this book.There is a poignancy toward the end pulls at the heartstrings in a different way. Poor Julian, though it all works out for the best, of course. And the epilogue is one of the most interesting and &quot;futuristic&quot; I've ever read. Will there be a book about Matthew?I suppose my reason for 4 stars is that I felt there was still some unfinished business, especially regarding Julian's friend Eric; and the whole situation with his father remained a downer--realistic, but I would have preferred a more idealistic resolution.

Okay, so Betsy has never been remotely like Gidget, but she does mature (some) in this book. While the plotting is light in this one, the character development is on the rise. Betsy has to face the consequences of her actions in a way that finally makes her take a good hard look at the way she treats people. Yes, she remains shallow and rather selfish, but not as selfish as before the events in this book. The romance also takes a turn for the better, and the ending actually earned a small sigh for romance. The half-sister plot (the main one) kind of fizzled, but she'll be back. In terms of big action, nothing much happened; several things were set in motion, however, so I expect the *&*%%* to hit the fan in the next one. Marc and Jessica have smaller roles in this one.I rarely buy hardbacks (Why, when I can get 2 or more paperbacks for the same price?), so I'll either wait for the paperback or buy it at a big discount.If you read this one without focusing on the minimal and nebulous plot, but look instead at the romance and character growth, you'll probably enjoy it. I'm giving it 4.4 stars for the lack of a strong plot, but everything else was excellent. In terms of romance (Betsy & Eric), it is my favorite so far in the series.

Demaris is hard to like at first. She's spoiled and selfish. But Fitzroger is marvelous from beginning to end and absolutely makes this book. He's glorious. Without him, Demaris would never have become a heroine the reader could like. She does, slowly, but it's almost all his doing.The intrigue is well done, as always for Beverley. I have to say, though, that I wasn't crazy about Ashart. I have not read Winter Fire, so I might feel differently if I had, though I like Genova and Rothgar here.If I liked Demaris better, I'd rate it 5 stars, so let's make it 4 & 1/2.

Goodnight has managed to create thoroughly delightful characters and an engaging plot in her first novel. Emily is a true minx of a heroine, a tribute to the secret adventuress in us all. Brand is somewhat bland as a hero in that he doesn't have some obvious outstanding trait. On the other hand, he is, quite simply, thoroughly delicious--the sort of man you'd honestly love to settle down with. His good humor and kindness alone make him a gem of a man--and much more interesting than Colin.Speaking of Colin, there are two romances here, and for a time, I liked Sophie better than Emily, but that didn't last long. One error on Goodnight's part is letting the secondary romance fall from the reader's attention for too long, losing its important connection to the main romance.The secondary characters are well conceived as well, with only Emily's father showing a bit of inconsistency. The villain is surmised fairly early, but works very well and pulls much of the plot together, albeit often behind the scenes.Goodnight's biggest problems are a poor understanding of English grammar and the lack of a good editor. Really, she makes some of the most atrocious grammatical and stylistic errors ("with he and Emily" and "elude" instead of "allude" and vice versa, to name only 3 of the many). Plus, the narrative portions can be overly long and could have benefitted from some judicious editing, preventing them from slowing the book's pace too much. In the first 1/3 or so of the book, long unbroken chapters make it difficult to find a convenient stopping place.However, these are minor complaints compared to the excellent characters, witty dialogue, engrossing plot, and delicious romance. With more attention to editing, Goodnight may well prove to be one of those "automatic buy" authors.

What's to like? A complex, sensitive, but scarred hero. A delightful, strong, lively heroine. A wacky cast of secondary characters. Just the right amount of humor. A bit of angst. Love scenes that generally seem to be there for plot and characterization reasons (unlike, for example, so many of Stephanie Laurens' books). And a wonderful, completely-sucks-you-in romance.Negatives? Yes, the pairing is farfetched, but George writes it so well that you can suspend your disbelief. There are some too-modern-sounding words and phrases and some Americanisms used by the British, but again, a minor issue. George doesn't tell us what happens to Nicholas' odd and charming servants. And I wonder at our lovebirds living arrangements, so far from what Nicholas has known (or his horse breeding). I personally would have liked to see Sheridan NOT be so strong at a couple of the really painful moments. And some people may be put off by Nicholas' hurtful remarks to Sheridan when he's been hurt, even though the reader understands the lingering pain from the past and the misunderstanding that are at the foundation. Still, ALL of these things are minor, very minor.This book was delightful from beginning to end and is a definite keeper.

So this book doesn't cover every possible term. Perhaps the words "complete" and "comprehensive" are misleading. It may also need an updating (1991 publication). It does, however, cover all the major terms as well as many lesser known ones. More importantly, this book does a very good job of explaining and illustrating the terms, including differentiating between some often confused terms. Easy to read, relatively easy to comprehend; uses good examples. A nice effort. I have found it very useful.

Melody Thomas declares herself a wordsmith and dedicates this book to her 2 &quot;goddesses of grammar.&quot; She needs new goddesses. And a better dictionary and/or a better understanding of the English language in use. She misuses an untold number of words, but even that is not as bad as her pompous and often unintelligable phrasing. I don't remember the last time I rolled my eyes or muttered &quot;good grief&quot; so often while reading a novel. Ms. Thomas needs to have some of her conceit surgically removed and take some writing courses.Her characters &amp; plot were milding interesting, and there were some good moments. Indeed, the potential was there. But both leads were often as exasperating as they were favorable--sometimes more so. I can't recall a single thoroughly likeable character...except maybe Rachel (more on her later). Ignoring any historical inaccuracies, I still found the story to be somewhat plodding and decidedly uneven. The unwitting accomplice was ridiculously obvious, the villain and his motives were cliches, and the ending was somehow unfulfilling. I struggled to finish the book, and often found myself skimming. The good points simply didn't make up for all the bad ones.This book sets up a story for Ryan &amp; Rachel. Rachel is a very interesting character in this book, very strong and capable, but Ryan is a pompous jerk (more so than Christopher, this book's hero). But I don't know if I'll be able to endure Thomas' inferior &amp; overblown writing style in order to attempt to read it, should it ever be published. I definitely won't buy it...or this one.The 2 stars is for the good points &amp; the wasted potential. But I think I may be being generous with it.

Some readers did not like this entry in the series, but I liked its complexity. While Bill seems to be acting out of character, it is all explained in the end, and Sookie shows a lit of grit that I was wishing she'd shown in earlier books. The Sookie-Bill-Eric triangle is a prime element here, as are the Weres, especially Alcide. Yes, some of the people, like Sam, from the previous books have small roles here, but I had no problem with that. Something about Sookie & Sam doesn't sit well with me anyway.Harris' writing is becoming tighter, although she still occasionally succumbs to extraneous narration and description. This novel is something of a transition piece, making the reader aware that Sookie is changing, becoming more comfortable with herself and the supernatural world she is privvy to. Not at all formula here.

Some needless repetition and a highly convoluted situation with Kathryn as a mistress (both interesting and irritating) create some problems in this otherwise interesting tale.Lee makes the 15th Marquess's many mistresses seem like a virtue; in the end, the reader has to like him. Drew is even more complicated in some ways than his father; he is still understandably angry with Kathryn for leaving him at the altar, but he still loves her. She has never stopped loving him, but circumstances do not look good. It takes almost the entire novel to sort out all the various misunderstandings, secrets, adn half-truths. In fact, not all of them are revealed in this book; more are revealed in book 3 (Always a Lady), and I recommend reading it immediately after this one.Both the hero &amp; the heroine are strong characters, and there's a excellent cast of secondary characters. Drew &amp; Kathryn are faced with an extremely difficult situation and must struggle with numerious complications to resolve things. If it were all a little less confusing, it would be a better book; more needed to be revealed to the reader earlier. I am still not convinced about Kathryn's reasoning for leaving Drew at the altar and never telling him why; I suppose she didn't know him well enough to trust him with it, but she should have tried.It's a good book, just not Lee's best.

There's plenty of those in this book. Beverley makes the reader feel the weight of the characters' mistakes and the pain it has caused them -- and the way those mistakes continue to influence their decisions. Because Susan had so hurt Con in the past and because he is still dealing with emotional wounds from war, he hurts her in this book -- sad, perhaps even cruel, but totally human. Forgiveness is one of the themes of this novel.On the other hand, Con is my least favorite of the Georges for some reason. This book didn't live up to my expectations of him from his appearances in other Beverley books. Susan is a strong heroine and their love is deep and genuine -- it merely takes time and circumstances to get through the remnants of the past.Often Beverley's books contain dark elements; this one is a case in point. The previous Earl of Wyvern was insane, a madness that manifested itself in torture and debauchery. Con's explosive reaction to this is fact is quite memorable. But the book has some very disturbing imagery because of this theme.Perhaps the most engaging character in the book is Con's friend, Race de Vere. He shows up later as a hero in his own right, but he is absolutely delightful in this book and provides some much-needed lighter moments.There are spans of narration, description, and inner monologue, but perhaps not as many as it might seem. This book is more slowly paced than many historicals and than many of Beverley's books. All in all, I'd place it on a par with St. Raven -- good, but quite dark and not her best. I might have given this book three stars, but it's a gem with compared to so many books out there; so I'm giving it 4.

I loved this book -- it was different and yet, thanks to the Beauty and the Beast basis, familiar. The book hooked me from the very beginning. Some reviewers have called it slow, and the lengthy bits of exposition do sometimes slow it down too much. The human villain is rarely actually there, usually relegated to being talked about. And there were too many mentions of Nicolai's hair. Other than those complaints, I thought it was very well done.Nicolai is an amazing character. Very Alpha male, but then he's a lion, sort of. He is certainly a great tortured hero--you want to hold him and make it all better, just as Isabella does. And he is VERY sexy. Isabella has great inner strength. She is almost too virtuous at times, but her positive outlook helps save the day, the hero, and all who live in his "kingdom."The secondary characters are rounded and interesting, most easily differentiated from each other. The elusive evil provides a dark, gothic flavor to the book. The emotion and suspense start early and carry all the way to the end. on top of all that, there's a very high sensuality quotient.Some reviewers have said this book is nowhere near as good as others of hers -- in that case, I cannot wait to read them, 'cause I though this one was way up there.

and all the good and bad that implies. There are moments when Berdoll's dry, sarcastic wit simply sparkles. There are also times the reader wants to gag from the overwrought language (give that thesaurus a break!) and from the devolution into soap opera. I don't have a problem with the "raciness" -- that's what the author was after (read the preface). I don't think Darcy would have been quite so openly affectionate, but I allowed the author some leniency there. It's primarily the "numerous mysteries of parentage," Lydia's continuing antics (without repercussions), and Jane/Bingley situations that are just ridiculous.The book is very, very long 465 pages in the version I read, and as such, can get too drawn out and long-winded. The author also has a lamentable tendency to cut back to the past without warning, leaving the reader to gasp a breath and attempt to put the pieces together. Darcy & Lizzy's long separation leads to a particularly dull section, with battle and its afternath the only enlivening features. The author attempts to do too much (and to think it was cut!) and the work suffers for it. Nevertheless, there are good moments and some particularly diverting one-liners and comic situations. But half-way through, the soap opera definitively overcame the good stuff and I was much less diverted. If I could take a red pen to it and slash it down mercilessly, we might have a good book in here. 2 & 1/2 stars ?One important word of advice: do NOT read the last chapter (93); it sets up an unworthy sequel that thankfully has never come to pass.

Elena & Symon are good characters and interesting to read about. Symon is especially intriguing as a clan leader who must fight madness to lead his people. Along comes the healer Elena, whom he wants to heal him and more. Her inability to trust Symon when he is so obviously trustworthy grates after a while. Most of the emotional power of the book comes from Symon as well. Even so, emotional power is not one of Ms. Wittig's strong suits. The villain's motives are not made clear enough early on to make the most of his character, and the majority of the secondary characters are flat or undifferentiated. As a result, the book doesn't quite fulfill it's promise. It is, nevertheless, an enjoyable read--just nothing to write home about.

I think JK Rowling outdid herself on this one. Much more comes into play--background info, character development, and so on. Yes, a main character dies; it is supremely well done and really adds to the characterization of Harry, Sirius, Snape, Lupin, Dumbledore, and others.Harry is such a jerk in this book; but hey, he's a teenager who needs to grow up quickly lest others die due to his immaturity. We learn so much more about Lupin, Sirius, and Snape, especially! I love complex characters, and JK gave me plenty in this book. She also significantly broadened our understanding of the wizarding world.In addition, the editing was well done, unlike Book 4, so that the reader could really enjoy the story. Order of the Phoenix pushed Book 3 into second place.

Justiss manages to combine a strong heroine with a boorish, though supposedly honorable, hero -- a hero you want to like, but often cannot because his actions are often reprehensible. It makes the reader wonder how the heroine can love this man who treats her with such little respect.Justiss also makes far too many grammatical and other writing errors for the reading to be smooth or the writing of top quality. By the way, Ms. Justiss, there's no such word as "idiotish." There are also a number of historical gaffes and plot errors (Has the author even seen a waltz? It doesn't appear so since the stance is repeatedly described incorrectly.) There is also far too much exposition, too much "telling" rather than "showing," making many segments of the book remarkably slow.To be fair, the love scenes are decently written, and there moments of witty repartee and romance. Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros, and the moments when you think the potential might be realized after all never come to fruition. One & 1/2 stars.

I hadn't considered the similarities to The Sound of Music until I read them here, but they are there. Still, William is much more interesting, heroic, and sexy than that movie's leading male.William does go overboard on the rules, integrity bit. He's rather dour at first and there are times that he's totally obnoxious. Samantha does forgive him too easily for his horrid treatment of her. Sh'es very energetic and fun-loving, which appeals to both him & his kids. Lady Marchant is interesting as is Duncan. In fact, they sometimes steal the scene. Nevertheless, Samantha is a feisty gal, and her sparring with William is often quite comical.The spy subplot is very long & involved and detracts from the romance. The worst thing is why on earth did it take nearly 4 years since the last book for the spies to be routed!!!!! Ridiculous! Beyond that, the traitors became stupid (no hints of such different inner characters in previous books) and, once it's done, the reader is thrilled to be finished with it. "It's about time!"Ms. Dodd makes many mistakes here as well, often forgetting her plotting or the details of her settings. For example, early in the book, there is an appearing/disappearing rug in the girls' room. This sort of thing occurs often enough to distract and annoy the reader.3 stars for Samantha's excellent characteriation & her interactions with the children & William; and William's not all bad either.

Both characters have a lot of leftover pain from their broken engagement; that drives much of their interaction and, therefore, some of the plot. Madeline doesn't trust Gabriel, thinks he's too much like her gambling, undependable father. He wants to make her admit that, make her admit the pain her father has caused her, admit her love for him, and gain her trust. He doesn't always do that well as he uses her attrraction for him against her. Madeline wants to control him, so Gabriel keeps trying to control her, to force her to give up control. Thus, their interaction is not always pretty. They are two very strong personalities who have to find a way to trust each other and to form a partnership, a give-and-take relationship.The young but wise Thomasin and the misogynistic valet MacAllister are superb secondary characters and are often the ones to get through Madeline's thick skull. Rumbelow is your usual brilliant-but-slimy villain who finally fails due to his own hubris. The Game of the Century was not particularly exciting; only the question of whether Madeline would finally trust Gabriel made it truly interesting.Warning: This book ends with a cliff-hanger, setting up the sequel, One Kiss From You.

I had to rate this book higher than Scandalous Again because it is most definitely better. Although it probably deserves just under 4 stars, I pushed the rating up to account for the signficantly better aspects of this sequel.Remington -- you don't know whether to like him or not at first, but he definitely grows on you -- just as Eleanor grows on him and he can't help falling in love with her. It's lovely to watch Eleanor blossom under his care; even though he is sometimes harsh and angry, there's honor and kindness beneath it. Eleanor's goodness and quiet strength get under his defenses. And they have some scenes that most definitely sizzle, too.While the murder mysery was not heart-stopping or pulse-pounding, it moved along at a good clip, made sense as a plot, and ended perfectly. A really enjoyable, light read.

The Pretender is my second Celeste Bradley book, and I am hooked. This one has it all: humor (I smiled through so many pages &amp; even laughed out loud a few times), heartbreak, longing, romance, sensuality, suspense, adventure, tenderness, a well-paced plot, and engaging characters.The secondary characters turn up in other books, which is lovely (and these two reappear later) because they are wonderfully drawn (Button &amp; Kurt, for example). Simon is truly dreamy and Agatha is indeed headstrong and quick-thinking. Unfortunately that sometimes gets her into trouble. My only complaint is that Simon didn't hang on to his fake accent long enough and he seemed, for a spymaster, rather slow on the uptake in figuring her out. But, get past that and the book soars. Splendid!

Anyone expecting this to be Julia Quinn or Teresa Medeiros will be sadly disappointed. Ditto those who are expecting a dangerous vampire as the hero. Gideon is a &quot;nice&quot; vampire; in Debbie Raleigh's world, vampires have secluded themselves from the human world and are essentially paragons of virtue--and rather passionless (but that changes when Gideon meets Simone).However, the attraction between Gideon and Simone is nearly as compelling for the reader as for the lovers. Gideon is something of a guardian angel, but that's a typical plot point in historical romances. It works here, thanks to Raleigh's development of her vampire civilization.Not the best romance ever written, but well above what gets published by most of the &quot;lesser&quot; publishers. Diverting, different, and sensual without being graphic.

This is a book I have mixed feelings about. There were moments I really enjoyed it and others that had me going elsewhere for entertainment.Billy is definitely the star of the book, but he's not as streetwise or as physically powerful as one would expect of a man in his position. His transformation into a gentleman is too easy for one who moved into a life of crime on the streets at 13.Jacinda is described as spirited, rebellious, vivacious, and so on, but for me she came across as rather staid and placid as a general rule. In the following book (Devil Takes a Bride), I hardly recognize her; they seem to be different charactaers. That Jacinda is the one described but rarely making an appearance here.The plot was only so-so. The book's a solid 3 stars: a decent read but nothing to make it stand out from the crowd.

Prudence has been in love with Nicholas for so long...but the last thing she wants is to marry this man when he does not love her, and to potentially see him come to resent her.I had tears in my eyes so many times reading this book. Prudence's situation was heart-rending at times. This is a very emotional story; right up there with the best of Mary Balogh in that regard.Pru is a sweet, shy gal who has managed to survive her boisterous, aristocratic family who take her for granted. It was so fun to watch her try to be flirtatious and seductive--she just couldn't. over the course of the story she grows confident adn strong. Nicholas is a realistic hero with some serious, though not insurmountable, character flaws, including his selfishness and his hypocritical views of the aristocracy versus himself and Pru.This is a sweet love story about a woman who dreams of an impossible love, only to discover that her dream man isn't perfect but only human, and a man who grows to love the wife forced upon him by discovering who she really is and by learning some unpleasant truths about himself. These two do not love because, but despite...despite their flaws and the difficulties in a relationship. It's a very mature, realistic, and warm story that touches the heart. Perfectly lovely.

I got tired of the back-and-forth thievery about the same time that Richard did, so the "real" theft was welcome. One of the best parts of this book was the story behind the missing brooch. It was almost better than the main romance.Isabel is mercenary, but part of that is a desire to care for her relatives. And she's one smart cookie. So much so that Richard has to admire her abilities to get one over on him. Richards's a lovely hero, but he doesn't really stand out from the crowd of fine romantic heroes.This isn't Hern's finest work, but it is a pleasant diversion, and I'm not sorry I bought it. She always puts the reader into the period.

Devin starts out very unlikeable, but gradually improves as Miranda's influence waxes and the-mistress-from-hell's influence wanes. Eveutally, the reader sees Devin as a lost, hurt boy who grew to hide his pain, loneliness, and feelings of worthlessness behind outrageous and debauched behavior. Miranda doesn't like him much either until she catches a glimpse of the gentle, idealistic soul he's tried to hide.Miranda is a near-perfect heroine: strong, determined, capable, kind, generous. Once she decides she wants Devin, she gathers all the information, devises a plan, and sets out to win him (and vanquish his mistress). Miranda will settle for nothing less than a real marriage based on love; in the process, she frees Devin from both his mistress and the ghosts of the past.Having Miranda snare Devin was a delightful twist. Her character is believeable with appropriate background to make her the capable woman that she is. Devin's transformation is slow and thoroughly convincing. The mystery surrounding the &quot;accidents&quot; and the attacks on Devin is generally well done; the rationale for the former is excellent, but not so good for the latter. The twist at the end is necessary for Devin's emotional freedom, but feels somewhat contrived. That and my uncertainty that evil mistress Leona is truly vanquished (seemed too easy) are the reasons for deducting 1/2 a star.The first in a fine series.

This was my first book by Gayle Callen, but it won't be my last. I loved this book! I admit I was a little leery of the Elizabethan setting, but Callen's writing makes it come alive with amazing approachability.Alex is a marvelous hero: gorgeous, tortured, hiding his hurts and broken dreams behind a laugh and a devilish smile. He's just out to steal a kiss from Emmeline's sister in order to win a bet, but he has to get past the big sister first...only to discover how intriguing she is. Then he only wants to make her see her own worth, until he realizes her can't get enough of her. Emmeline is an excellent heroine as well, thinking herself undesirable and living to see her sister well-married, but quite capable of standing up to Alex, until she begins to realize that she's falling under his spell.Callen delivers, with plenty of laughs, emotional depth, and intrigue, plus well-developed secondary characters. And the chemistry between Alex and Emmeline sparks right off the page. Great book!

Wow! That Publisher's Weekly review really had an ax to grind--and it bore little resemblance to the book. That reviewer seems to have forgotten the mores & laws of the day as well as the other factors involved.Jack definitely has his problems, and there were times I was put off by them. Indeed, his character seemed so changeable--for example, his later anger problems seemed at odds with his more laid-back demeanor early in the book. But Jack has not completely overcome the horrors of his youth, and Amelia--or his surprising feelings for her--become the trigger for years of repression to fall away. Much like organizing your basement, it gets worse before it gets better. But Monk really makes you feel Jack's despair at the thought that Amelia might leave him and his inability to articulate what he feels for her. As for the charges of near rape, ah....no. Amelia was a full participant.Speaking of Amelia, she's a pampered gal who gains a lot of wisdom after she meets Jack. Unfortunately, there also comes a time when she seems to lose her newfound backbone. The servants and Jack's family are terrific secondary characters--sometimes they nearly steal the show. Ha! And Jack as a doctor was excruciatingly funny.On the charge of too many unanswered questions....that's a big Yes. It's the book's major downfall. So many threads are set up--very important ones--and they are never resolved. Very bad form that. Therefore, I'm rating it at 3 stars.

I read this one at the right time; I needed something very different so that it did not compare unfavorably with the wonderful book I just finished solely because it came next.The voice and tone of this one was definitely different, unique (to me). It had funny moments; much of it was farce. The romantic leads are strong and well-suited to each other, there's a host of quirky individuals serving as secondary characters (Perry, whose book is next, was my favorite).On the down side, there were too many secondary characters and too many subplots; these took away from the main romance. In some ways the book sort of made fun of the genre, or at least of the historical period. Michaels kept the unusual voice & tone throughout the piece and managed to keep all the people and shenanigans separate, individually interesting to varying degrees, and neatly wrapped them up. However, it's not my favorite way to approach a romance, and I found it sometimes slow and frustrating because there was too much going on, much of it very silly indeed. I like my romances with more emotional power.So it was a good read, especially of you're looking for something different, but it's not on my favorites list.

Very likable characters in a great small town setting. Like most small towns, the past is always present and influences the characters and situations. The secondary characters are generally as realistic as the leads. The story moves at a good pace and contains the emotional content to move it past average. I wasn't crazy about the outcome of one of the relationships; to me, it seemed out of character. That was the main reason for the 4 stars; it sounded a sour note in an otherwise very enjoyable read.

even ignoring the class differences and Lillian's unaccountable acceptance by the ton...But then... along came the queen's dog. From that moment on, this book became a farce. It was so often downright silly. I swear, that dog-napping plot was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read! Several times, I almost threw the book across the room in disgust -- and I never mishandle books.Without that disgusting subplot, the book would have been enjoyable despite its aforementioned historical defects. But the plot and the characters actions and dialogue during that were some of the most horrid stuff I've ever read. If you read Robins, get this one from the library so that you have additional background for More Than a Scandal -- and I do like Nick -- but you either have to wade though the disgusting dog plot or skip that section. Actually, the latter may be the better idea; then the book woun't be totally spoiled for you. 1.5 to 2 stars. Could have been more without the *(*&#&^%^ dog.

Robins has said this is her best novel, but I'm not sure I agree. And I can't really explain why it didn't work for me -- which is going to make this a pitiful review. Marcus and Cat were both interesting characters who became known to the reader slowly through the course of the book (especially Marcus), but they somehow still don't seem very deep by book's end. There was a lot going on in the plotting, perhaps too much; it never totally gelled for me. This book takes place (at least in part) simultaneously with One Wicked Night. Yet neither meshes that well with the other. BTW, there's not much scandal here. Like One Wicked Night, the title seems to have little to do with the story. There should have been scandal, but it never materialized. There are some hot scenes, but Robins is starting to approach Stephanie Laurens territory, in which the sex scenes become gratuitous and thus boring and repetitious.I read a LOT of books in quick succession (vacation). Perhaps I just read so many very good or superior books before reading this one, that it suffered by comparison. Three & 1/2 stars.

As with the previous book, the "danger" was too easily resolved. Aside from a few slow scenes and a bit of repetetiveness, that's all the bad that can be said about this novel.Ian is otherwise a compelling hero (his guilt is only a problem in its being drawn out), and Attie, who understandably mothers her little brother and nearly hero-worships Ian at first, is fresh and winsome. The secondary characters are well differentiated and fully developed. Although there's a lot of exposition, it rarely drags and usually adds much to the understanding of the characters and action. The topical quotes at the beginning of each chapter are interesting and humorous.All in all, a good book that leaves me wondering when her next will be out.

This was my first Debbie Macomber, but it won't be my last. The romance is near perfect and the heavenly assistance provides that extra touch and more than a little humor. Watching Roy and Julie interact is such fun. Roy's mom and Julie's dad make interesting subplots.For those who like a "cleaner" romance, this is for you. The sexual attraction is there, but it's a by-product of their attraction to each other as people.In addition, it's a real "get into the spirit of Christmas" book. Plenty of love and joy to go around. Just delightful. I'll be checking out her other books, too, especially any more Cristmas ones. This is the best Christmas romance I've read yet.

I wish I could say that I like this book more than I did. Max & Catherine are terrific characters; Max especially is a very complex, and therefore compelling, character. And there are some very nice secondary characters as well. The murder mystery carries on throughout the novel, and there is uncertainty about the killer's identity until the end. The sex scenes are very hot, very erotic. The reader also gets the sense that Carlyle has done her research on the period; it infuses the narrative and action but is always just beneath the radar.The murder mystery does, however, generally overshadow the romance. For at least half the book, the protagonists are apart more than they are together. When they are together, it's exciting, but the book often plods along in between. Part of the problem is an over-reliance on narrative; usually it's while delving into the psyche of one of the characters. That information is importnat, but Carlyle has so much of it and in such long segments that it significantly slows the pace of the novel. When I've plenty of time, I can easily read a book in a day; this one took me nearly 4 days, becuase I just couldn't stick with it for long periods of time.Another problem is that several of the many secondary characters are not sufficiently delineated to keep them straight; this is especially true of most of the murder suspects. A good editing could make this a fabulous book. If you like a lot of mystery with your romance, try this one. If steamy romance is your thing, skim through the murder mystery sections and focus on the combustible scenes between Catherine & Max. If a lot of narration really bothers you, you might want to look elsewhere.

I wanted to like Felicity more than I did; I felt that her reasons for acting the way she did were never made convincing enough. At least she eventually recognized her bad behavior for what it was. Thorn was terrific; rather than the type of guy you like to read about but could never imagine living with in real life, Thorn was very much the kind of guy you'd love to settle down with.The chase ploy did drag on too long, as did the lead couple's back-and-forth romance, all of which slowed the pace of the story. Nevertheless, it was a good read and, if you like comparatively mild stories, worth a few hours of one's time.

Not quite as good as The Adbuction of Julia, in my opinion, but still a wonderful story. Unlike tAoJ, A Belated Bride drags just a little in spots and needed a resolution to Robert &amp; Liza's situation.Nevertheless, Hawkins delights with a story of second chances. Arabella is a strong heroine in the highly capable and responsible, but still heartbroken mold. Lucien is the hero who loved and left, thinking he was doing the right thing, but never able to really face up to his decisions...until he ends up back in her life. Arabella and Lucien's passion sizzles at every encounter, and the reader so wants them to get it right this time.A stable of interesting secondary characters helps keep the momentum and humor going. And there's plenty of humor with Arabella's aunts around. The plotting may not be quite as tight as tAoJ and the main charcters just slightly less heartfelt, but not enough to seriously diminish the book's appeal. As I said, I'd drop it only 1/2 a star. Therefore, since it certainly deserves better than 4 stars, I've stuck with the 5-star rating. It's a good follow-up to tAoJ, in which Lucien was introduced (and in which he is very appealing as well).

While not my favorite of the series, &quot;The Seduction of Sara&quot; is an enjoyable romp. Sara is not my favorite heroine; she's too bent on mischief without concern for the consequences. You'd think her ex-husband's escapades would push her into greater propriety. But Nick is an excellent character; his bouts with excruciating migraines are an interesting twist. Unfortunately, that problem is never really dealt with in any final way; only the accompanying problem of pain killers is addressed--and that without certainty.However, secondary characters Anthony &amp; Anna and Delphi &amp; Henri help make up for those deficiencies, as do the many incidents of comic relief. There is a poignancy to Nick &amp; Sara's romance that also tugs at the reader's emotions.Not the best of the series, certainly, but welcome within the context of them all. Because of that, I'd recommend reading it in order.

Only sporadic enjoyable scenes kept me readig until the end. I wondered several times.Sion is a troubled man who overcomes his adversities to emerge fairly heroic -- except sometimes in his relationship with Katherine. I liked their constant battles except when they (mainly Katherine) deliberately hurt each other. Sometimes she was so unlikeable, so unworthy of Sion (strange name, BTW). Her situation before Sion was appalling, but she was so distrustful and rash that she created real problems. Some parts of her side of the story were very good and realisitc, but she became too annoying.In addition, the dialogue and actions were often not in sync with the historical realities. And there was a lot of repetition in Sion & Katherine's relationship. I wouldn't bother, if I were you. There's so much more to choose from.

I really didn't expect much from this book--which may have worked in its favor--but it was quite enjoyable. Amelia is a spoiled socialite who makes a rash decision to marry. Her husband dies on their wedding night, and Amelia discovers that he's not rich but in debt. As the book progresses, Amelia undergoes a change in character, becoming a wiser woman with depth. In the process, she falls in love with ne'er-do-well drifter Michael, who's living at the boarding house she inherited from her short-lived marriage. Michael, however, is much more than he seems.Although there are times the writing style annoys me, Amelia is a beautifully written heroine and Michael is pretty drool-worthy. The other boarders are an interesting group, though some are given more depth and attention than others. Except for wishing it had a true epilogue, the only thing that really irks me about the book is Amelia's stupidity, meaning that she often does things she should know better than to do. It's rather like watching a movie and shouting at the character to not open the door or some such. Still there are some lovely scenes and moments of real romance. All in all, probably a 3 & 1/2 star book.

More often than not, I really like Victoria Alenander; she's one of the authors who got me started on romances. It's probably a good thing this was not one of the first of her books I read. Excellent premise, but the execution was way off.Nicholas was an okay guy--your typical haughty aristocrat. Sabrina started out with such promise, but in the end didn't live up to her characterization. She's supposedly lived the last 10 years wearing a mask that slowly falls away during the course of the novel, worn that mask for love of her daughter. But in the end, she simply leaves her; I didn't buy it. She supposedly led a band of smugglers who adored her and followed her with unswerving loyalty, yet we see nothing of those qualities in a long and boring trek across the desert--for nothing. This is also the woman who is determined to never be dependent on another financialy again--but she doesn't follow her investments to the point that she's barely solvent? Too many things don't add up.Everything in the book is set up to get these two together in love; unfortunately that fact is far too obvious. Everytime a new dilemmna is needed, the author simply states a reason for things to be different. For example, Sabrina's daughter is not enamored with her fiance's sea sickness; she needs to see him do something heroic. So the ladies are kidnapped and the dear fiance just happens to be the only one available to rescue them, which he does with absolutely no difficulty. And Nicholas is supposedly an important man with political aspirations--but he can take off for nearly a year at a moment's notice?As for the witty repartee, it isn't all that witty; Alexander is capable of much better (see her Effington series, except the last one which was as dreadful as this tale). Secondary characters have as much if not more life to them than the main couple. Nowhere near Alexander's best.

I really wanted to like this book since it contains so many familiar characters, especially Piers Verderan. However, the writing is sloppy is so many ways. There are numerous grammatical and typographical errors. There are far too many characters to keep up with. There are 2 sets of lovers and neither story is utterly compelling. In fact, the supposed primary set becomes the secondary set as the book continues. Beth is often the viewpoint character, but rarely the romantic heroine. And Sir Marius is simply not given enough depth. In addition, there are several scenes that are simply fluff and do nothing for the narrative or charatcer development. The entire scenario is far-fetched as well. One might want to read it for background on other characters, especially Verderan (from the excellent Emily & the Dark Angel), but it's not a buy or a keeper.

Although I didn't like this one as well as Taming the Heiress, I am always impressed with King's meticulous research. This novel provided an interesting dilemma, but it was almost too involved, too convoluted. The ending was well done, but something about the romance seemed lacking. The characters, especially Aedan, were not as strong as in the previous novel.

This is probably the worst of the Signet Regency anthologies I have read thus far.The first story, by Nancy Butler, is horrendous. One star or less! She steals Shakespeare's Robin Goodfellow and places him in Regency England where he becomes mortal to protect the woman who protects the fairy lore. Hmm. The story has little originality and less emotional pull. I had to force myself to finish it; had it been a novel rather than a short piece, I'd have given up. Ick.After that disaster, the next story almost seemed worth 5 stars (but only by comparison). Nevertheless, it was the best of the bunch. Emma Jensen crafted a perfectly delightful story with an abundance of interesting characters, one of which was the house itself. The story was tightly written with great humor, an appropriate dash of pathos, and an ending that leaves the reader with a smile. one of the best stories written for this sort of Christmas anthology. Too bad it's stuck with such company. Perhaps worth up to 4 stars, certainly 3.Edith Layton was simply not up to form in her tale. First of all, considering the social mores of the time, how on earth could the hero call on the heroine without ever having been introduced to her? Although the story started well and promised an interesting twist (with the lady relying on liquor), it quickly became unrealistic and preachy. The result was singularly unsatisfying.Add to that, the dizzying lack of proper punctuation... Layton has a penchant for comma splices, the text often has to be reread to be understood. (For those who don't know what a comma splice is, that was one.) Maybe a 2, if you're feeling generous.Item 4 wasn't up to Barbara Metzger's usual standard either. It was a fairly interesting premise, what with the ghosts and the curse. But the ghosts were annoying and the resolution to the curse too pat. on the positive side, the war-disfigured hero was a nice change of pace. Indeed, the main characters were likeable if fairly ordinary. Touches of humor helped, too. The end result is a pleasant though generally uninspiring story. 2 and 1/2 stars.The final entry is Andrea Pickens' tale. The heroine starts off as a spoiled brat, who naturally rediscovers her better self well before the end of the story. Then, however, she turns weepy when she's around the hero even though she's jolly the rest of the time. I think I would have liked the hero a great deal had he been in a longer work where we could have learned more about him. The story line for the romance has the typical reticence and misunderstandings. Nothing special, but mildly enjoyable. 2 &amp; 1/2 stars?I wish I could rate the book higher for the sake of Emma Jensen, but alas, the whole does not deserve it.

So often faerie plots wind up contrived adn silly; this one doesn't. It actually is very believeable. Eden is a midling sort of heroine; she changes and grows throughout the book and eventually becomes worthy of the title. But that comes at the end, so it hampers the story a bit. Hern/Hartley/Cornelius is superbly written, very strong, yet a touch vulnerable even as a Fane lord. The forklore is very well done as are several of the minor characters. Perhaps the wrong done is forgiven too easily, too quickly (except of course between the hero & heroine), but it's not much of a detriment. There are a couple of loose ends I'd like to have seen wrapped up. At the climax, I was crying so hard that I couldn't read the page. Not perfect, but an exceptional book well worth the read.

The lead characters, Dora and Zical, are really good, especially Dora, the computer made human. The story line is excellent. There are real mysteries, dangers, and frustrations. In many ways, I liked it better than The Challenge (the training by sexual frustration in that one bothered me). But this book repeated too much of the first one, especially in the sex scenes; I could have interchanged the names and noticed no difference. Also, the resolution came too swiftly for all that went before. Otherwise, this book might have surpassed its predecessor. Certainly Zical's despair over Dora's climactic action was superbly written; I cried for several pages. But it was all resolved too abruptly, so allow the proper emotional responses to occur in the reader or even in the characters. All the elements were there; they just weren't handled as well as they could have been, leaving this reader unsatisfied with the result.

Edmund begins as an exceedingly wary man; it takes the innocent and genuinely caring Gwyneth to eventually earn his hard-to-win trust. He's been so deceived and harmed by her extended family that she must be another means of twisting the knife. Gwyneth, however, knows nothing of her family's evil plans; all she wants is a loving husband and a family and a home of her own. Edmund seems rather dark after his earlier appearance in His Scandal, but his change began there and becomes clear as we learn what has happened to him.Enough mystery in who's the traitor to maintain interest in the backplot. Humor, romance, sensuality, and emotional appeal. An excellent follow-up to His Scandal.

After enjoying Ms. Krinard's previous two books in this series, I was looking forward to Quentin's story. It was a big disappointment and took me forever to read. Quentin almost seems like a different person from the previous books. While Johanna is a strong woman, there is almost no chemistry between them. This book is much more a study in mental illness than a romance. If you can read it for that, it's somewhat enjoyable. The action really didn't get going until 3/4 of the way through the book. The happy ending is very abrupt; it reads as though Rowena is there, but she isn't. There's very little werewolf in it either.There'll be a delay (at least) before I try another in this series...it was that dull.

Farr definitely writes with the flavor of Heyer, and the story starts out with great promise. Unfortunately, the more I read, the more I was disenchanted by it.Chloe is supposed to be vibrant, independent, and innocent; more often, she comes across as ridiculously naive and reckless, lacking in common sense. I want to like to her, and at times succeed, but she can be so hare-brained! She often longs for a man to take the burden off her shoulders; rightly so, since she usually makes a mess of it. However, her failure to recognize Gil's growing romantic feelings, her conflicting responses to Lord Rival, and her concern for her sister-in-law are well done.Gil, her best friend, is a lovely young man who is almost too perfect. His greatest fault is a tendency to let Chloe run wild (and roughshod over him). Some of his finest moments come when he puts his foot down. Although Chloe obviously needs him, I almost felt that he was too good for her.The sister-in-law is irresponsible and annoying, while her husband receives most of the sympathy in their troubled marriage. Thankfully, Tish &amp; Gil's mother saves the day; she's an interesting character, but she did something totally wrong in society's eyes while being presented as the paragon of social mores. Also odd is the &quot;fact&quot; that she and her husband have a wonderful marriage (and he's a wonderful man), but the reader never sees Sir Walter.The most interesting character, however, is the &quot;villain,&quot; Lord Rival. The dashing rogue is the most complex character in the book: jaded, bored, not particularly praiseworthy, but he has begun to lament his life and his choices. There's a depth to his character that is missing from the others. He vacillates too readily between these two aspects of his character, though, and eventually just walks out of the book. I'd love to read a story about him and an equally complex heroine.Sometimes the wording is stilted (too many uses of &quot;one&quot; for example -- one can do what one......) Sometimes the historical social context is faulty in order to further the plot. And I cannot for the life of me figure out why Gil's friends are his friends; they seem to have nothing in common with him.It's a nice story that I wanted to like more than I actually did. As I read, I just became more disappointed. I'm not sure I'll be happy with the rating I'm choosing simply because I'm so conflicted about the book. I suppose if you like simplicity and flagrant historical/social errors don't make you want to hurl the book across the room, you'll like it better than I did.

I literally stayed up all night to finish it.Take several handfuls of Bedwyns (all appear with their families), add a cup of Pride & Prejudice, a dash of Notting Hill, and liberally lace the whole thing with vivacity & humor (thanks to the heroine) = the result is a nearly perfect romance and a fitting conclusion to the Bedwyn series. This book is a welcome return to the splendor of A Summer to Remember, but with more humor than pathos. Wulfric was worth the wait.No, this story has little intrigue and few sex scenes--it doesn't need them. Slightly Dangerous is a rollicking good time and warm, wonderful romance. Wulfric really somes into his own here as we see the man behind the Duke. Christine is vivacious, and even her thoughts are delightfully chuckle-worthy. She will make an unconventional duchess, but Wulf needs someone who'll bring out the boy he used to be, the lonely man behind the cold face of the Duke of Bewcastle. Watching Wulfric mentally roll his eyes at Christine's antics while perversely (and unwillingly) being attracted to her is outrageously fun. Seeing her melt the ice around his heart makes the reader agree with Freyja: "If this is what you have done for him...I will love you all my life."Indeed, there are few truly interesting secondary characters at the house party, but the focus does remain solidly on the romantic leads. Once the action moves to Bewcastle's estate, the Bedwyns provide plenty of delicious filler. And, in the bargain, we get to catch up on all their families.(...)Slightly Dangerous is a classic romance. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be thrilled with the final entry in the Bedwyn series. How I'll miss them, but I feel honored, especially after this book, to have shared their lives.

As a general rule, anthologies are a mixed bag, and all too often, barely worth reading. This anthology, fortunately, is not the latter; it's also not so much a mixed bag and simply not the best work of the authors. James' heroine is decidedly bold; London's lead couple are such happy, pleasant people that one can't help smiling through most of the story; Lee deftly presents an unusual & harrowing situation; and Navin uses a spoiled debutante as the main "villain." I thought London's story the best, and Navin's the weakest. It's decent as anthologies go; some can be dreadful. But it's certainly not James' or Lee's best work. This is my first read for the other two; I'll read more of London, but examine Navin from the library until I read more of her work (maybe shorter works aren't her forte).

Like the book is okay and had some very good moments, overall it just wasn't that great for me. Devellyn is very hard to like at first, and later he seems to be almost a different person. Sidonie is a very conflicted woman, but I could really sympathize with her. There were some very sensual scenes, and the reader can definitely feel the attraction, especially on Devellyn's part.Characters are so important to me. I can forgive many things about the plot is I love the characters. I didn't love these two. The avenging angel plot is not only overused lately, this wasn't even an original take on it, and Sidonie's rationale was not convincing. I will say, though, that I loved the change in Devellyn; he's great in the epilogue. Plotwise, some things were handled far too simply and too late, rather like an afterthought.I liked secondary character Alasdair, who's the hero in the next book. We'll see. For me, The Devil to Pay is 3 & 1/2 stars.

I liked Brook a lot, and Mallory was much more appealing than I had expected from earlier novels in the series. He came into his own here. The new Lord A'Court was creepy but had no real teeth. The true villain didn't work well. The plot was weak, sketchy. Brook's mom was certainly odd. The author did an excellent job of bringing others, especially Tipton, back into this book; it was nice to catch up with them.I liked the book fairly well, but it wasn't as good as the rest of ther series. I'm giving it two & 1/2 stars.

Once you do, these stories really keep your interest. They are somewhat different, and two of them definitely veer into fantasy. While the connection between the lovers in those two tales is lacking in concrete motivation, the situations pull the reader in. Moreover, there's almost a moral or something to take away from each story that lifts it above the ordinary. For example, while Allena made me feel even more domestically challenged than usual, she was a reminder that everyone has different gifts & abilities and should not be put into someone else's mold. I do wish Roberts would use names more often; I tended to forget them sometimes when she used pronouns most of the time.It's been ages since I've read Nora Roberts, but I'll be back.

I was looking for something different, and I found it. HeartMate is a story that occurs in a fascinating setting that includes science fiction, fantasy, and romance. Owens blends these genres well and comes up with a winner, literally (RITA).T'Ash is part of the ruling class, but lost his family at 6, raised himself in the mean streets of Downwind, and fought his way out of there, through vengeance against his family's killers, and back into the nobility. He is very powerful magically, an impressive fighter, haughty and arrogant in the fashion of the nobility, but also fearful of the dark part of his nature that he had to rely on for so many years. In addition, he is totally inept when it comes to a relationship with a woman--clueless. It's this very dichotomy that makes him interesting.Danith is an orphan who's been rejected too many times, felt alone too many times, and is sick of others telling her what to do. So she's not too keen on T'Ash essentially commanding her to be his (among other things). But he also gives her what she's always wanted--he discovers her magical ability and sets her on the path to harness & use it. Then again, that utterly changes her life, and she's not sure she likes it. He pushes; she runs. Her fears and doubts are understandable, but her resistance does get old.The story is very interesting, in large part because of the world Owens has created, a world that is both familiar and different. She manages to set up the world and deliver a romance in a seamless fashion. Although the story dragged some in the middle, it generally held my interest well. I will read the rest of the series, but not immediately--perhaps a book or two in between.When you consider that this is a first novel, it's obvious that Owens will go far.

There are a few small problems--minor character inconsistencies, clunky plot points, and a few grammatical errors--but overall The Duke is a fabulous book. Bel's dilemma is heart-wrenching; how can a gently bred woman turn to prostitution? Necessity. But she chooses an avenue that allows her to retain some dignity. How blessed she is to pair up with staid, honorable Robert, a man who sincerely believes he must be perfect even if that means he is miserable and alone. Robert's love heals Bel, as she breaks down the walls that protect the kind, passionate, romantic man beneath the facade of the Paragon Duke.The reader aches with Bel as her life disintegrates around her, hopes with her as she finds salvation in Robert, and cries for her when her heart breaks. Sometimes you could smack them both, but Foley makes the emotional turmoil behind their decisions (right and wrong) very clear. In addition, Robert's inner war between honor and love cause them both pain before he realizes what's really important. His "conversion" is a joy to behold.The reviews seem to run the gamut on this book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think it may be my favorite in the series. Ignore the minor problems and immerse yourself in the depth of emotion Foley creates.

Despite being saddled with the name Archibald, the hero was completely delicious--the sort of man any woman in her right mind would walk through fire and water to call her own. Archie was honest, intelligent, charming, romantic, sexy, kind.....flawless (and I mean that in the best way).Camilla's insistence on marrying a duke never had a convincing rationale, but her struggle with literacy was well done. Yes, the barrenness issue was over-highlighted; we've all seen this plot before, so there were no surprises there. Indeed, several elements were "old" in terms of being used often by romance writers. There was some predictability here, but I wouldn't knock off more than 1/2 a point for that because so much is well done. The joy in this book, for me, was in the truly loveable Archie, the willingness of each of these people to sacrifice their own desires for the other's sake, and the strong emotional elements present, particularly in the last third of the book. Keep the tissues handy!

I honestly don't understand the ruckus over the Sabrina theme. There are no new stories; the differences come in the details &amp; the telling. And Christina Dodd has done a fabulous job of rewriting the &quot;Sabrina&quot; storyline, which is itself a variation of the Cinderella story. Personally, I enjoyed the correlation.Garrick is my favorite of the Governess heroes; he's strong, intelligent, and interesting, but not overly macho. Responsible almost to a fault, but not at all &quot;high in the instep,&quot; Garrick starts out seducing Celeste to keep her away from younger brother Ellery, but winds up falling for her. Celeste, meanwhile, comes to admire &amp; then love the inigmatic older brother, although she'd had her heart set on Ellery, who is newly betrothed in an important family alliance. Ellery is a self-centered adult boy, much like the younger brother in &quot;Sabrina.&quot; Garrick is a widower who desperately needs a governness for his daughter and...another girl. Celeste, the head gardener's daughter, is the perfect fit; the girls love her instantly.The chemistry &amp; sensuality are there; Celeste &amp; Garrick are a thoroughly believeable couple. The spy storyline worked for me; it was just enough for the tone of the book. I considered giving it 5 stars, but 4 &amp; 1/2 is more accurate.

This is an average book in every way. The main characters are mildly interesting and have minor flaws (like Noel's tendency to to order everyone about and Claudia's tendency to be too lenient with her stepson). But they don't stand out from the crowd, are not memorable. Claudia's original china was a nice touch, though. All the additional romances were obvious from the beginning and almost seemed intended to fill out a skimpy story. All were pleasant characters. Only the vicar was unique, and he was not likeable.The book's a pleasant read, but there's nothing exceptional.

The plot is very similar to the Richard Gere movie &quot;Sommersby&quot; but Dodd goes a step further and this is actually more believeable, though not totally.I didn't like this one quite as much as In My Wildest Dreams, That's my take, although others obviously disagree. Enid is strong but bitter, understandably so, but that made it take a long time for me to like her.The England to Scotland shift seemed like a totally unsubtle plot device to me. Others found the mystery compelling; it held little interest for me. Note that this book begins near the end of In My Wildest Dreams. It is most beneficial to read that one first! Some of the story lines &amp; characters overlap.The hero is a mystery man for nearly 1/2 the book, but I'm not sure that his revelation is an improvement. Something about the Scottish setting &amp; events didn't sit well with me. I have been unable to put my finger on the problem. Perhaps part of the problem is the love scenes; there's a bitter, coerced, used quality to them.There are good moments in the mystery, but it did not need to be dragged through 3 books (the 2 mentioned &amp; My Favorite Bride).

Tara Road is very much a chick flick. Themes are facing reality, empowerment, surviving tragedy and heartbreak, and moving forward with courage and hope. There are some very nice moments in the film; unfortunately, they are countered by equally lackluster scenes. Moreover, the secondary characters still almost every scene they're in. They may be the best part of the movie, other than the payback scene.I always want to like movies with Andie MacDowell, but in this case, she shines only when she gets takes a stand for her new Irish gal pal. For the rest of the movie, she's sad, dull, and rarely interacts with the other characters. She and her movie husband have the thankless task of portraying boring people. And there is NO chemistry between her and a would-be Irish suitor.The other female lead, Rea played by Brenda Fricker, while alarmingly naive, is a much more endearing character. Her healing moments, as well as her painful ones, come across as much more genuine than do MacDowell's. I found myself sometimes chiding her penchant for trusting the wrong people, but also cheering her recovery. With Andie, I just wanted to move on--yes, a horrible situation, but she left me cold most of the time.The film also suffered from some unrealistic situations, or unrealistic to me, at least. Andie's husband, an English teacher, spent two months in Hawaii? For what? How? Ireland is deep into fall (with most characters wearing short sleeves outside) while Connecticut is still having summer weather. Connecticut? Not an autumn leaf in sight? This lack of attention to detail can possibly be overlooked, but when added to an uneven script and characterization, it's a noticeable nuisance.Again, the movie isn't terrible and has some scenes that are quite good. They're just too far apart to avoid mediocrity. If you're in the mood for this type of movie, go ahead. Just don't expect a fabulous movie. Generally, I though Under the Tuscan Sun, while playing on different themes, was a better movie.

It is, however, better than The Maiden Warrior as a whole, in my opinion. I'm rating it at 3 stars, but it's more like 3 & 1/2 -- just not quite 4.Braeden is excellent--noble, determined, kind. Fiona is wounded, then healed by his love for her. The conflict between them is interesting. Themes include not judging based on heresay and people aren't what you expect. The book is often sweet and Braeden's kindness slowly tames Fiona's wariness.McCall presents a good villain and an engaging climatic situation. Some scenes resonate beautifully, and her writing is always clear and rich. But something was missing; I could not put my finger on it. If I still had the book, I'd flip through it again to try to discern the proble. Perhaps it simply wasn't compelling enough emotionally, but mostly I think I simply tired of the heroine's personal struggles. McCall writes very sensitive heroes, but her heroines are too bristly and begin to irritate me long before they realize how wonderful their men are.

I was so looking forward to reading this book. I love Alexander's Effington family series, but I was so disappointed in this one. It was not at all up to her usual standard. The story dragged and I sometimes had to force myself to pick up the book (that's an unusual occurrence; typically the book has to be really bad). This book isn't awful, it's just so below the norm for this author.St. Stephens is *very* romantic. He's a delight. But Delia is somewhat childish and reckless. I'm still not sure what he saw in her. Some of the secondary characters are quite nice, but I was disappointed in Delia's mother. She's not your usual Effington woman. Granted she's an Effington by birth, but that made no difference with the other wives. Delia doesn't even seem to be a typical Effington, and until this book, they were the kind of family you wanted to be part of.The story is mainly about the hero and heroine relationship; the subplots are thin. The who-done-it was superficial but the villain was a surprise.The best thing about the book is the hero, who is incredibly romantic; he just goes out of his way to please her and understand her. But otherwise...a book I wish I'd borrowed instead of bought. I had to immediately go read something I knew I'd enjoy.

Pleasing, but not worth hardcover prices. The strong paranormal elements were interesting, but sometimes veered into "too convenient." Theo is a thoroughly pleasant man, but not a memorable hero. Megan is a strong, smart woman, but only slightly more memorable. Her sister is actually a more memorable character. The murder mystery takes precedence over the romance.Pleasant, but I wish I'd gotten it from the libary or waited for the paperback. The tone and content of this review mirror my enthusiasm for the book -- nothing to get worked up over.

I remember liking it and thinking it was MUCH better than Delia's story (The Lady in Question, I believe), which I truly disliked. By the way, Reggie's game-playing IS explained. I really liked the opening and found much wit throughout the book. And there was a declaration. I thought the ending was unique and humorous--very Victoria Alexander. There are some terrific secondary characters; I'm looking forward to Christian's story.Although not a perfect book and not Alexander's best, its flaws did not keep me from enjoying the story. While the most accurate rating would be something between 3 & 1/2 and 4 stars, I'll go ahead and give it 4--it could use the boost.

I always have high hopes for Victoria Alexander, but recently her books have been wildly uneven endeavors. Her earlier novels made her a favorite of mine and hooked me (along with Julia Quinn & Suzanne Enoch) on romances. Sadly, this book is only so-so.It started out with a bang, and the dialogue was splendid. I adored Nicholas' scene playing pirate with her boys. Indeed, Nicholas is pretty darn great most of the time. But Elizabeth is trying--yes, her vase-throwing was very annoying--and I wasn't crazy about her as a mother. She has good moments, but I think she's the weakest link in this book.I have to call the book average -- and that's not a good thing for this writer.

Under the Wishing Star is a pleasant, lightweight romance with likeable lead characters and a romance-only plot. The tone is gentle and, while there is an undercurrent of emotional pain, it never takes on grand proportions.There are a few slightly-less-than-believable moments, but nothing that actually harms the story. The novel does at times drift toward sappiness, but humor or a surprise or nasty relatives brings it back in line. The pace is a tad slow at times, and there is occasionally too much &quot;telling.&quot; The lead characaters, though likeable, do not stand out among heroes & heroines (nothing sets them apart), and the secondary characters are mostly stereotypes. Again, pleasant but nothing special.This is an enjoyable read, it just doesn't have much to make it extraordinary. I'd love to give it 3 and 1/2 stars, but since that's not possible, I'm going with 3. Its lack of that something special prevents me from bumping it up to 4 stars. It's a pleasant read, just not much more.

This little romance does little to tug the heartstrings, but is a rather enjoyable bit of escapism. The murder mystery is almost humorous at times and the byplay between the leads is often witty. Daniel is a reformed rake who can't seem to remember the reformed part when he's around Isabella, who is determined to remain unmarried and live life by her own rules...until she realizes she can't get enough of Daniel.The dialogue is sometimes stilted or silly, and there are occasions when the exposition halts the flow of the story. As mentioned, there are no great heartaches (past or present) nor any overwhelming passion (though they can't keep their hands off each other). It's diverting, but not exceptional. The secondary romance really could have used its own book.

The reviews on this book seem to run the gamut, but I enjoyed it very much. Even though I happened to read the other two in the series first, I was able to enjoy this one out of order. I'd always liked Ross Cannon, and I found him to be a very realistic and wonderful hero. He is strong, kind, intelligent, and has no qualms about letting Sophia know how he feels about, how important she is to him. He's a workaholic who decides there are more important things in life, so he puts her first.If there's a flaw in the book, for me it's that Sophia falls under Ross' spell too quickly, considering she's hated him for so long. But I honestly can't blame her either. Both have given up on love and find it in each other despite a common person about whom they feel very differently.To read this book before reading &quot;Worth Any Price&quot; would be wise just so that you get a picture of Nick Gentry (considered by many to be the best romantic hero of all) before you read his story. &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; is the first in the trilogy. However, each is enjoyble on its own and need not be read in order (I didn't and loved them all).

Although he may not be my favorite hero, Nick Gentry rightly belongs near the top of the list. Many readers consider him THE ultimate romantic hero. I was certainly surprised by his secret, but I think it makes him more endearing. He's come a long way from his days prior to &quot;Lady Sophia's Lover.&quot; He's still outrageously handsome, dangerous, and conflicted, but we see more of that softer side that was hinted at in LSL.The situation set up by his taking on the job of finding the runaway Lottie and then falling for her permeates the conflicts of the book. Lottie is a fine heroine--resourceful, unassuming but strong. Considering Nick's past, she's just the woman he needs.A splendid addition to the series.

Ms. Boyle's style is a big stumbling block on this book; there are some very tortured phrasings, including some that simply do not make sense. The book is sometimes slow and the murder mystery is solved almost too quickly. That subplot is the least fulfilling part of the book. Indeed, the whole murder-ruby angle detracts from the lovely romance.There's some very nice humor; Rafe is a good hero; and the heroine is quite likable except for her desire to hang onto stolen property as though she deserves it. Perhaps it's supposed to be symbolic of the corrupting influence of the gem (the curse), but it doesn't really work. Nevertheless, Rafe and Rebecca are very good together. The romance part of the book is quite good, and is marred only by the subplot and by Boyle's overblown prose.

Cynssyr is terrific. What a guy! Not possible to say enough good things.Anne...why won't she trust him? He proves himself over and over. She is not very intuitive about people; she is too trusting of everyone else. Otherwise she's a decent heroine, and I like that she's older.The mystery was not very good; it seemed forced. But the love story is quite good. Three and 1/2 stars.

An interesting read with a determined suitor and a strong lady with little belief in her charms. Although books of this sort (brief Regencies) rarely delve deeply into issue and psychological or emotional troubles, this one at least addresses character-making beliefs and actions in some fashion. For me, the problem was that Ardith's self-doubt seemed overwhelming in the face of St. John's complete sincerity and devotion. Moreover, she is so capable that the reader has trouble accepting her opinion of herself. In addition, the rest of her family are pretty much one-note characters, though there are a few minor variations.It had some very lovely moments, but didn't always hold up well. A good percentage of the action seems forced. It drags due to Ardith's stubbornness to believe in St. John.

While this is supposedly a Regency romance, it smacks of the Georgian period, especially in the fashions. Simon never really grabbed me; he was such a dandy. Though Henrietta is an engaging heroine. Her torment over being unable to bear children due to a deformity is a significant thread in her character and the story.Other reviewers are correct in saying that Esme and Sebastian steal (or nearly so) the show. They played too big a part to keep from interfering with the main storyline. They certainly need their own story.It's a good, if flawed, book. The letter is definitely not &quot;very steamy&quot; and I disliked the manipulations of Henrietta and Esme over it, but all-in-all the book's worth reading. Buying may be a different thing.

Ian and Reyna are strong characters, but he's too macho for my taste and she could use more inner strength. She succumbs so easily. There's lots of intrigue and it's passionate. But the book is too long and has little heart until the end.It's been a while since I read it and I took few notes, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars.

The Company of Rogues books are a splendid series, and this book is no exception. Miles &amp; Felicity are excellent characters and their interactions just sizzle. Wit, danger, sensuality, and much more combine to make this an excellent read. Miles is a warm-hearted, easy-going hero faced with a hellion of a ward whose plans to make things better always seem to make things more difficult. Sparks fly between them in a dozen different ways, each of them delightful.Other members of the Rogues make appearances (a common thread through all of them, as Miles &amp; Felicity have appeared in other books), tying the novels together nicely. The cats are a key feature; one cat scene had me near tears, shouting &quot;No!&quot; to the author. A nice, subtle bit of Irish paranormal adds to the setting and tone of the book.The only caveat is that Felicity has essentially grown up with training in society; as a result, being Miles' wife, the future Countess of Kilgoran, will be a difficult feat. The reader is left to assume that Miles and his family and friends will provide her education.That aside, however, A Dangerous Joy is a joy to read.

This one is my favorite in the Carpatian series because Feehan finally has a heroine who's really the equal of the hero and because Julian isn't quite as arrogant and bossy as the other heroes have been.Desari is just as strong/gifted in her own way as Julian is, and she makes sure he understands that. She doesn't spend most of the book fretting over her situation as his lifemate, and she has strong loyalties to others besides Julian (her family). These family dymanics plus the tension between Julian as a loner and Desari as very family-oriented add welcomed additional elements to the plot and the characterizations.There is still an element of repetitiveness, but it is MUCH less is this entry than in previous books. In fact, this book was enough different that I might continue the series. I give this one just under 4 stars.

Very true to the story. This game started out rather boring, especially if you've already played the other games in the series, but it just keeps getting better. Don't buy it if you have the game on PS2, either, it's exactly the same, but it's a harder game than the second and easier than the first. You could almost say that it was a happy medium. Being a Harry Potter fanatic, myself, it was rather exciting to finally be able to play a game on my first console. Being almost sompletely true to the book made it all the better. Play it!

Cathy Maxwell seems to be one of those authors who runs either hot or col. This one falls into the cold territory.Lyssa is spoiled, immature, and annoying. Ian is much too good for her. He's the best part of this novel, and his struggles against the prejudices of his Irish heritage ring true without beating the reader over the head with it (most of the time).Most of Lyssa's adventures result from her selfish immaturity, thus making them senseless and rather annoying for the adult reader. A disappointment.

Not my favorite Cathy Maxwell book. The protagonists are pleasing enough, but their fussing over the house becomes old, but their growing feelings for each other carry the story along as do Colin's political ambition and their struggles with their families. The house itself is nothing but a device, really.The book is pleasant enough, but not nearly as engaging as Maxwell's usual fare, and there is something about it that almost seems unfinished. Thus, it is merely okay.

In Fantasy Lover, Kenyon begins to build a fascinating world in which the Greek gods and heroes, etc. still live and interact with humans. Her characterizations of them and their receptivity to the modern world are quite interesting.Kenyon's elevation of sex over romance makes sense in this book since the hero is a love slave. The heroine's ability to see the man behind the body provides a window into his tormented soul. Still, Grace as a frigid sex therapist is an odd sort of twist.In any event, the book is definitely worth the read, even if some events scream their arrival chapters ahead of time. If you're looking for something steamy with a dose of pathos and a dollop of humor, try this one by Kenyon.

While this novel occasionally peaked reader interest and maintained a fairly steady pace, it is not very romantic and deals much more with the setting of the romance--the war and its environs--than with the actual romance of the main characters. Indeed, much of the book is about Rachel and her ne'er-do-well husband. The idea that the scandals surrounding Rachel can be so easily put aside is preposterous; she may be a victim, but the result remains. Jacob is a nice man, but does jump off the page. In fact, the whole book is rather mundane, due in large part to the extensive narration of wartime events.And the title has nothing to do with the story.

Martin breaks one of the romance taboos in this book -- infidelity. That is the make-or-break point for many readers. I was disappointed with Rand for that, but he eventually won me over. At that point, it was like a second book; everything seemed to start over.The whole search for the necklace was a little hokey, and the dangers in the search were glaringly obvious. Another problem was that the sex scenes were sometimes gratuitous and emotionally superficial. Rand seemed to think that sex was all he needed to win Cait -- and it was all too often true. All of that makes the book less than satisfying.Nevertheless, there are good moments, and I certainly want to go back and read Nicholas Warring's book. When you add the pros and cons together, it's an average book, and Ms. Martin is usually better than that.

I adored this book! It is a pure romance--no intrigue, just a beautiful romance. And the St. John talisman ring is even more interesting than in the previous books.Devon is simply wonderful: charming, sexy, sweet. He's a dear, and I adore him.Kat is a fabulous heroine; she's not in the usual mold, but is making her own way in the world. And she certainly sends Devon on a merry chase. Her "7 dwarfs" are fun; unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought it an amusing twist.A secondary romance is healed along the way, too.This is a wonderful addition to the series! I want the next book -- now!

Although Nevin is a fascinating hero, I never really warmed up to Penelope. She is so cold and nearly shrewish that one cannot fathom what so entices Nevin. It is only at the end of the book that she starts to thaw, but it should have happened earlier and gradually. Nevin is nothing but gentlemanly, and Penelope is always finding fault, distrusting, and pushing him away.The secondary characters are well developed; in fact, the secondary romance is more believeable than the that of the leads. The youngest sister and the mother are particularly well done. This book could have been very good if the heorine had been more sympathetic.

Julian is a lead that is very reminiscent of some of Georgette Heyer's leading men: cool, elegant, wry, ethical...a good man trying to make a difference in the world but beset by a scandalous wife and rumors started by enemies of all sorts.Laura is an ordinary young woman just trying to make it to the next day. She's an actress trying to maintain a pitiful roof over her head and not completely starve. Her friend Celia eventually convinces her that becoming someone's mistress is better than starving, but she just can't do it. Enter Julian, who offers her a position as his mistress in name only (an effort to squelch rumors about himself).As they spend time together, however, they become attracted to each other and fall in love (and into bed). The married man & faux-turned-real mistress is an interesting and unusual set-up. These two carry it off perfectly. One wonders how the requisite happy ending will occur, but it does (and without the unbelieveable idea that everyone will suddenly welcome Laura into society). What will this do to Julian's political career, though? That's not explored.There's mystery, intrigue, betrayal, and more alongside the poignant love story. The true villain is slowly revealed (as it should be), but the characters are a little too slow to catch on, are too trusting. Well-developed secondary characters add flavor and appeal and help move the story along.Not a perfect book (one irritation for me was Higdon's frequent misuse of pronouns), but an enjoyable one. Rather low on the sensuality scale, but most of the book was geared to their no-sex arrangement. Very nicely done when it occurs though.

Callen's newest work is enchanting. Jane is a reluctant fiance who keeps looking for ways to convince her father to end her betrothal to a fop. But William isn't what he seems; in fact, he's not quite sure who he is or who he wants to be...he's been a spy, putting on other personalities, for far too long. Even though Jane turns out not to be what he thought he wanted in a wife, she's exactly right for him.William's &quot;Lord&quot; routine is amusing as are Jane's exasperated responses. But as he reveals his true self in small ways, Jane becomes intrigued. Danger from a traitor adds to the tension and serves to draw them together. Both people learn about themselves and how they unthinkingly try to force the other into a certain mold. They learn, they grow.A delightful read.

Sam & Julia are good together, the solving of the murder (accumulating evidence really) is fairly well done, and Sam's family makes good secondary characters. The problems are the easily handled henchman and the way everyone suddenly accepts Julia and Sam as a couple. Sam himself had major reservations because of their difference in station; suddenly, at the end, everyone -- including his mother who was quite outspoken -- is all in favor of it. Nor is there any mention of how the awkwardness of a son and sibling becoming the master was handled. Too quick and easy a resolution, which is the main reason for lowering the rating.

Could any two people be better matched? While the previous two books emphasized how different the hero and geroine were, this one concentrates on how perfect they are for each other. True, the H & H aren't always convinced of that, especially Ewen, but the reader is. They definitely bring out the best in each other; at one point, Ewen realizes that they are each better people with the other. That's what relationships should be. Ewen helps Felicity control and appreciate her magic, while Felicity herls him take more responsibility -- or perhaps appropriate responsibility -- for his life. Sweeter than the previous two, perhaps because Felicity is young still, but a lovely, lovely romance.On top of all that, we learn more about the mysterious Aidan, and there are two (not one, but two!) mysteries to solve. And of course, the families show up, creating their usual, delightful havoc. So stop reading this and go read the book!

I adored every page of this book! Karen Hawkins has a real winner here. From the very first sentence, I was drawn into the story and the characters.Greyley is marvelously arrogant and &quot;growly&quot; while Sara is a nearly perfect heroine--strong, determined, fiery, and witty. They sizzle every moment they are together. Secondary characters are generally well-drawn and engaging as well. The plot moves along swiftly, with Hawkins' writing keeping the reader's attention throughout. I was very slightly disappointed in the second and pivotal love scene, expecting it to be somehow &quot;more,&quot; but by the end of that section, it no longer mattered. And even though I would have liked a bit more about this terrific couple in the epilogue, the story was utterly satisfying. The flaws are so minor as to hardly be worth mentioning. The romantic leads are engaging, the story entertaining, and the end result delightful.&quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; is one of the best books I've read. I can't wait to pick up another Karen Hawkins' novel.

...despite knowing all along that the ending will be bittersweet. Eric's lost his memory, and as a result, becomes a delicious guy rather than an amoral one. With Bill out of the picture, Sookie & Eric hook up. Add to that unrelenting intrigue, a dangerous coven of witches, a missing brother, and a variety of shapeshifters, and you have a completely engrossing story. More, it definitely makes the reader wait eagerly and impatiently for the next installment.You'll enjoy this one more if you've read the rest of the series so that you know all the backstory, but I think it can be enjoyed on its own merit.

Neither of Lady in Green's lead characters is very likeable. Annalise plays cruel pranks and spreads tales that harm Gard's reputation in order to force him to be moral, which is later supposed to show her love for him. ? Gard is a certified rogue and womanizer, even attempting to bed someone else the night before he plans to propose to the heroine (it's his late free night, you know). ! He does improve as he learns a few things about women and their plight, but he never becomes heroic in any sense. She is quite sanctimonious, but she falls in love with him even though one of the reasons for breaking an earlier engagement is that her fiance had a mistress. It's more hypocritical than it sounds. This story is conventional, trite, and dull. The romance is unconvincing, with her falling for a man she can't stand and him loving her without ever knowing her as a person. Don't bother.Minor Indiscretions has a better heroine (although she seems too together for her age), although it was disturbing to have the hero want to make a 17-year-old, JUST-out-of-the-schoolroom girl his mistress (no, not his wife, his mistress). Other than that, the hero becomes quite likeable as he's seen interacting with the children she cares for. But Metzger ignores so many of the conventions of the day, that it becomes annoying for a reader reasonably versed in such matters. The love between them is uncertain, even though a friendship seems real enough. While somewhat better than Lady in Green, I found this one uninspired and uninspiring.

I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer. This dictionary had a great premise, but fell far short in the execution.I would expect to see some words included that are often misused, such as &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;. But &quot;Gentile&quot;, &quot;civil&quot;, or &quot;rotund&quot;? There are a number of words that I can understand being included, if only for their similarity to other words (as above) or because the are actually foreign words (nom de guerre, for example). But most of the words included are not particularly confusing, much less difficult.The good thing? The definitions are clearly worded.In a nutshell, there's a reason my local library has it shelved in the juvenile section. For them, it would be a dictionary of difficult words. Advice: peruse it first. See if the majority of the words are truly difficult for the user.

I read all 4 of these authors. James rarely fails; I generally like Carlyle, too. Alexander and Maxwell are a bit more hit or miss for me. These perceptions held true in this anthology.Alexander's was my least favorite. I remember my gasp when Captain Robb showed up at the end of a previous book. Here's the story, and it's bland and disappointing. It was not helped by Marcus, Earl of Pennington telling the story. Him, I like, just not his telling the story. The device was simply awkward.Maxwell's wasn't top notch either. It was a pretty ordinary humdrum plot with a less than likeable heroine and a hero who seemed easily duped. Both hers and Alexander's seemed rushed and almost trite. Carlyle's and James' were more complex.It's hard to decide whether to give the "best liked" label to Carlyle or James, but I think it goes to Carlyle by a hair. Her characters were interesting (lead and secondary), and although the reader could easily figure out what was happening, Carlyle made it fun to watch the characters grasp it piece by piece. James had strong leads as well and included a few unique elements, like the fair and the nature of the other suitor. There was more humor in Carlyle's story, but both sizzled where appropriate.4 stars for these two, less for Alexander & Maxwell, leading to 3 stars overall.

The Imposter takes up the story of Dalton Montmorency (introduced in The Pretender), fleshes him out some more, and gives him a doozy of a romance. His last proposal (and the one before) are SO romantic. Sigh! Clara is a fabulous heroine: so smart, and talented, and sensible...except where Dalton/Monty is concerned. Like The Pretender, both main characters engage in the title activity. Here, both Dalton and Clara pretend to be someone they are not...more than one someone, in fact, to hilarious results. But in the midst of that mind-bending posing and a nasty bit of political intrigue, there are some wonderfully sweet and poignant moments of love, romance, and sensuality. Ah, the cat.... Underneath Dalton's formal exterior beats a kind and lovely heart.Although this novel didn't quite jump into the romance as quickly as The Pretender did, Clara's superb characterization made up for it. Feel free to read these two back to back; they occur only weeks apart, and you'll love revisiting familiar characters.A pleasure to read.

Such a marvelous man, who despises his looks because of...well, I won't spoil it.And Arabella is the exact opposite of what is considered beautiful, yet she has such strength of character.Their road to love is widing and dotted with potholes, but what a ride it provides. Sizzling passion, laughter and wit, raw emotion....A Perfect Groom touches all the right chords. This is one of my favorites.

While not quite as funny as I expected from the delightful premise, this story is still humorous and heartwarming. Eliza is independent, sometimes unwittingly hoydenish, and generous of heart. Magnus--no, not the best name-- is sexy, warm, witty, and much less arrogant than your usual romantic hero. They are beautifully well-suited, and their chemistry is undeniable.The two aunts and sister Grace provide delightful secondary characters to alternately vex and adore Eliza. Caskie's dialogue is reminiscent of Jane Austin, eliciting the flavor of the era. The only letdown for me was the epilogue; though approriate, it was rather dull.Caskie has talent and should become a shining star in the genre.

I was really looking forward to Caskie's second book, because I thought her first one, Rules of Engagement, an excellent first novel. The wait, however, ended in disappointment.Jenny is thoroughly conceived as a character--unfortunately, she's shallow and materialistic. Even after her attitude about what's important supposedly changes, she's still, at the end of the book, a woman who absolutely MUST shop, who must buy whatever her heart latches on to. Callum is a threadbare character, limited to a Scottish burr, a kilt, and a pitiful excuse for refusing to marry her. A very lopsided romance, character-wise. What's more, Callum initially seems drawn only by lust and comes across as less-than-respectable. Jenny is simply so self-absorbed that she uses and manipulates those who care about her without seeing the poetic justice when others (the "villains") do the same to her.Caskie completely ignores the social rules of the day, making the story and the outcome even more far-fetched.The Featherton sisters are still eccentric, but not as charming as in the first novel--nor as vital to the plot, a plot that is quite contrived. The other secondary characters were bits of cardboard and irritating fluff that could have been easily switched around without a discernable twitch in the plot.This is definitely one I'm glad I picked up at the library instead of buying. The preview of her next book, however, looks wonderful. One can only hope.

Although the heroine is very young indeed, that's not unusual in the genre or in marriages of the day. While I would have preferred that she be a bit older, it played into some of her insecurities.Connor is impressive--quite charming, quite lovely.It's not a perfect book, certainly, but it is charming and a thoroughly enjoyable read, even if the author sometimes expects readers to remember a minor character at significant moments. I also thought the letters to the aunt odd since they were merely a device. But other than a few minor qualms such as those, I enjoyed The Runaway Duke very much.

I debated about giving this book 3 or 4 stars. Three & 1/2 would have been best. No, it's not particularly original and neither the plot nor the characters will haunt you for any length of time. This story features little in the way of emotional depth either. However, it is pleasantly diverting, has likeable if somewhat superficial characters, some interesting secondary characters, and a nice twist or two to its sometimes unlikely plot.Beard's writing races along, pulling the reader into a pleasantly diverting tale with appropriate swiftness. Perhaps the motivations of the characters are not well explained, and the hero's rakish qualities uncertain. But the solicitor hero and the stalwart heroine are a good match. All due to one dance, once kiss? Yes, because she fell in love with him in that moment. Jack's fear -- literally panic attacks -- at the thought of marriage makes for an unusual complication.It's not Julia Quinn or Teresa Medeiros, but it's a decent read.

Not only does she really "get" romance and love (unlike some authors who focus primarily on sexual attraction), but her writing is, quite simply, beautiful. I often catch myself stopping to pause and savor a particularly well-written phrase or sentence. Not many authors can do that.Lucy is, by turns, spunky and timid, depending upon the presence of her father, the admiral. But it is that contradiction that both enrages adn calls to Gerard Claremont. His rival is the mysterious Captain Doom...or is he? The twists and turns of betrayal and deceit keep the story moving and intriguing, and watching Lucy come out from under her father's thumb is good character development.Still, for me, it is not Medeiros' best work. I cannot put my finger on anything specific; I liked the book, but it just didn't resonant with me as some of her others have. Nevertheless, it is a very good book.

Teresa Medeiros has become one of my favorite authors, but Fairest of Them All is probably my least favorite of her books (so far). The book starts off brilliantly, but eventually the &quot;curse&quot; drags it down, becoming slow and tedious in places, dark and unsettling in others.Austyn begins as a wonderful hero, simply marvelous, but his belief in the curse causes him to become a tyrant, albeit to protect her from himself in some ways. Holly becomes more likable as the &quot;curse&quot; takes effect and she becomes less shallow. Most of their love scenes are lacking in love, but one that is only sets the stage for heartbreak (a necessary plot element). The climax of the book is very well done however, and the epilogue is one that will leave readers more than content.It's better than 3 stars when you consider all romances, but I gave it only 3 when I compared it to other Medeiros books. As long as you don't expect this to be one of her best, you'll probably enjoy it. Read it when you don't want one that will keep you reading late into the night.

I kept returning this book back to the shelf, skeptical that I would like a time travel tale with a heavy dose of contemporary romance. I'm not usually fond of contemporaries. The blurb on the back cover made me wary. However, Teresa Medeiros hit gold yet again.I really did not like Tritan at the beginning; he was such an arrogant, heartless jerk. Later, however, we see why he acts that way and who is really is underneath that harsh facade. Having said that, however, he is also quite cruel to Arian at crucial moment; granted, it's because he finds it so hard to trust, but the scenes are quite painful even for the reader. That is a testament to Medeiros' ability to pull the reader into the emotional lives of her characters. Arian is innocent to Tristan's jadedness, and through her, he once again sees the possibility of hope. He wants to believe in magic -- for several reasons. And their relationship is magic.The twists on magic and science and the mystery of how her 17th-century life connects to his 20th-century one are splendidly realized. This novel is near perfection in its handling of emotion, suspence, multiple plot threads, and character building. Run to get it!

Ransom is not my favorite hero; he is arrogant in the extreme and his feelings for and thoughts concerning Jane do not always place him in a flattering light. Jane is a very likeable heroine, however -- brave, resolute in many ways (especially toward the end), and a very talented, intelligent woman. She is, in fact, more intelligent than Ransom. As he falls in her eyes from a god to a man, Ransom becomes more approachable and likeable for the reader as well. But he did not handle his spy duties well, and I found that a flaw in the book.Really, the whole spy plot was confusing at times, not in the end but because of how it was developed and revealed. I still have mixed feelings about Jane's niece Adorna's romance, but the one involving Ransom's sister was quite well done indeed. I had no problem, as some readers did, with Frederica getting away with her display of Jane's sculpture. To me, it simply illustrated the sometimes fickle censure of the ton.All in all, this is not Dodd's best in my opinion; it's uneven in its characterization and execution. But I enjoyed reading it this second time nevertheless.

Reding had me in tears for at least 1/3 of the book. Grace tried so hard, and Christian was so cruel...but you understand his position and that he is cruel for a reason. Anyway, Grace's situation really pulls the tears from your eyes. Then you're appalled at what Christian has had to live with that leads him to act as he does. Reding takes most of the book to explain Christian's life/viewpoint, so you may have to trust that he is truly worthy of Grace.I found the first part of the book the best; the second half, which takes place in Scotland, seemed slower, less dramatic despite its often serious subject matter. Reding has obviously done her research, but the reader sometimes feels hit over the head with it. I would have enjoyed seeing more of Christian's transformation & his time in Scotland with Grace; it would have added greatly to the story. The tidbits we get are wonderful but too little. His grandfather's actions & rational needed more explanation and his transformation (?) more attention.Despite those less-than-perfect aspects, White Knight is a powerful story well worth the reading. (It beautifully sets up book 4 as well.)

It's not that this is a BAD book, it's just ordinary. It does, however, have some nice moments and interesting characters. As the other reviewer noted, the huge surprise was not treated as a significant event, but I found nothing wrong with the ending otherwise.There were awkward moments and subplots not fully explained or left to dangle, but overall it was a fairly pleasant read -- especially at a season when so few books are worth cracking open.

I did not realize that this was Kathryn Smith's first novel; as such, it's very good indeed. It does have its problems, however. Chief among them is the trust issue; its rehashing got quite old. The truth behind the murders is not wholly believable. Varya's worries about Ivan prove fruitless, and therefore a waste of time. But the chemistry between Miles & Varya is credible, and there are a number of very nice scenes. For some reason I have yet to understand, I rarely like romances set in Russia, but the Russian scenes here are enjoyable. The ones of the ship may be some of the best. Smith defintely shows talent here that will be more fully realized in other books where Miles & Varya figure as secondary characters. That makes it nice to know their story.

Lots and lots of guilt hanging around here. So much so that it got old. Smith also had a tendency to repeat phrases, the kind of repetition that a reader notices (and dislikes because it makes the writer look like she couldn't think of anything else). The book was long and sometimes slow. I'm not sure if there was too much exposition or if the exposition just wasn't compelling.I loved the beginning of the book; Brave and Rachel getting together was well-done. The marital abuse was poignantly portrayed. And Brave's relationship with his friends was great; real friends they are, and their friendship was so much more real than Rachel's with her girlfriend.) Maybe I need to reread Julian's story after reading this one.)This book has some wonderful moments, but it would be better had it been shortened. Three & 1/2 stars.

Jarrod Stone is the epitome of a wealthy, arrogant, I'll-do-whatever-I-darn-well-want man. He is so incredibly brash that you have to admire his audacity. Before too long, however, the reader glimpses the past hardships and unswerving devotion to his brothers that lie under that unforgiving exterior.Sophia LaRue is cunning and bold enough to repeatedly try to thwart him, but she too discovers that she's based much of her life on false assumptions. Their relationship is full of strong emotion and intense longing. Very, very satisfying.The discovery of the truth about their pasts is extremely well done. Wade does what few other authors do--she actually allows one of the important secondary characters to continue to suffer. That, supposedly, will be dealt with in another book. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen.The most troublesome aspect of this otherwise engaging book is that Wade seems to have stopped writing. &quot;An Innocent Mistress&quot; was to have been the first in a series of 4 books. In this one, the reader gets to know and like all four brothers, but no other books of any kind have been published from Wade since this one. I found that most disheartening, as I was really looking forward to the rest of the series. That's the main reason for the 4 stars.

Kate was a manipulative, deceitful thing, even while proclaiming her love and respect for her husband. Jared was quick to judge, but then fell in completely with her treasonous schemes -- and him working for the government!!! He's a pitiful spy, and his friends with him. Plus, all three of them orphans and all happen to earn titles of nobility??? Only the children were remotely worth reading about.Kate, Jared, and the author should be hanged for the indiginities we readers have had to suffer in this sorry excuse for a novel. It only cost me a dollar, and it was a waste of money. There is little pleasure in this book. I should have rated it 2 stars, I guess, but I couldn't change that.

The potential was there, but it never happened. I actually struggled at times to finish it. Why? It was boring...deadly dull.Kleypas writes as though she's trying to cram in everything she's learned about Russia and somehow manage a novel out of it. The characters never really come alive -- the secondary characters, the hero's daughter and the heroine's dangerous cousin, are more engaging than the romantic leads. Plus, I never bought into their feelings for each other. It was a mish-mash that lacked heart and emotional pull.I found myself mentally rolling my eyes or grumbling in annoyance as I'd reread the same phrases over and over throughout the book. And the love scenes? Clinical and uninspiring; worse, they seem to be in there just to be there--they do not flow from the story. Considering there's an overabundance of them, that's very damning.Avoid this book and get one of Lisa's other books; most are excellent, but this one's a dud.

It was so hard to decide how to rate this book. It's wonderful, but after the tour de force that was A Summer to Remember (which I finished the day before I started this one), it seemed somewhat less. Having said that, however, I enjoyed the book and will buy it (the one I read was from the library).It starts a little slowly (not the first chapter, but afterwards), but the reader is soon drawn into the emotional lives of the characters. This is Balogh's forte: intense, realistic emotion. It is a pleasure to watch Aidan Bedwyn slowly (very slowly) emerge from his cool, harsh demeanor, and it is Eve's sweetness and strength that does it. Unknownst to the other, both give up their private dreams to settle for a marriage of honor and convenience--one that is to never be a real marriage at all. But as they are forced to spend time together, they discover a connection that leads to feelings neither had wanted and a new dream neither dared hope for.I had disliked Freya Bedwyn (the sister) in A Summer to Remember (in fact, I wasn't crazy about anyone in the family except young Morgan), but she becomes a more rounded character here, as do most of the family, especially the Duke. Thus, I am beginning to like them--or at least be intrigued by them. They are certainly not your usual, too-gorgeous-to-be-real heroes and heroines. Aidan is dour and stiffly formal, but so dear once you see the man underneath. And Eve's surprising rebellion against the formidable Bedwyns could have you cheering for her.The problems for me were a little too much description, some secondary characters that could have been more fully developed (they were merely walk-ons, really), and the love scenes. There was little passion in the latter; in fact, Aidan's approach tended to suck all the passion and romance from the scene, especially the most important one (the first time, it made sense). If I were Eve, and he did that for the rest of my life, I think I'd smack him upside the head.Mostly, however, Balogh does a fine job of pulling the reader into the lives of her protagonists, getting into their heads and allowing us to feel their doubts, hopes, and heartbreaks.

unlike some of the reviewers, I really liked the protagonists, especially the heroine. I thought Judith was fully developed, a woman of depth and passion who had been hamstrung emotionally by well-meaning but dead-wrong parents (her father especially). In the light of her upbringing, her attitudes are understandable. Rannulf has been a do-nothing, but some people take longer to grow up; that's a very big part of his change over the course of the book. He is almost unlikeable in his rakishness at the beginning, but it does not take the careful reader long to see beneath the surface. He's not the somewhat damaged hero that brother Aidan is, and that may account for some of the negative reactions. He's had it pretty easy up until now and that can make a person less than serious about life and responsibility.Judith, and his ailing grandmother, however, change all that, just as Rannulf's support of Judith changes her. Her horrible relatives (aunt and cousin) and her ne'er-do-well brother are intriguing secondary characters who truly move the plot and the romance along.I thought the book was more than slightly spendid.

I have so enjoyed the Bedwyn series, but Morgan's story was a disappointment. Morgan's sensitive soul fails to touch the reader because of Balogh's preachiness. The war took up most of the story line and Morgan's face-to-face encounter with the horrors of war came across as a series of sermons rather than windows into her heart and the anguish she surely feels. Only her concern for brother Alleyne and her sense of betrayal by Gervase touche the reader's heart.As for Gervase, even after he supposedly loves Morgan, he uses her to get revenge upon Wulfric. Despite occasionaly feeling sorry for him because of the unfairness of his earlier life, his treatment of Morgan after they had become friends was not well done; it seemed like a cheap plot device.I did, however -- as is the case with the best of Mary Balogh's books -- share the Bedwyn's grief enough to cry with Aidan and Wulf (yes, Wulf).I wanted to like this book, but for Balogh, 2 stars is all it's worth. From anyone else, it might be worth 3. This time, though, the disappointment was too great for me.The best thing about this book is the burning desire it creates to read Wulf's story. I'll be chomping at the bit until June. If it's a disappointment, I'll have to wait a long time to read this author again; I've been waiting for his story too long. Until then, Alleyne's story appears in May; and the anticipation of that is another good thing about &quot;Slightly Tempted&quot; -- both of the final books in the series have excerpts at the end.

First the criticisms. Yes, this book is sometimes quite slow, with Camp doing a lot of telling. It is an unfortunate necessity since the protagonists have lived with a sham marriage for 7 years. The reader needs to know their history, and there is no easy way to convey all that. So the first half of the book is a bit slow while the author gives the reader all the necessary info. In addition, if you've read the other books (or either) recently, the redundancy is annoying. Read some other things in between to alleviate that problem.Michael and Rachel have indeed built their own individual prisons that keep them from recognizing the truth about their relationship, their feelings, and each other. Indeed, they do not know each other at all. Their oh-so-polite marriage is something both want changed, but they feel helpless to do anything about it after so many years. But then rumors crop up, misunderstandings are set up, and the pursuit of truth leads to an untenable situation in which Michael must pretend he's his illegitimate half-brother, and Rachel must find an inner reserve of strength and struggle with what she thinks are adulterous feelings. Her &quot;revenge&quot; when she finds out that Michael's been deceiving her is priceless!I found the mystery in this book to be interesting and slightly surprising. I like it when I don't have it totally figured out well before the villain is revealed. The book also features a decent cast of secondary characters.Rachel grows a lot in the book, discovering inner depths and suppressed dreams. Michael shows that he's more than a kind but distant gentleman; he's also a highly intelligent investigator and talented master of disguise who has loved her since the day he met her.Get through the first 1/3 or so of the book, and the pace really picks up. As for the far-fetched idea that Rachel doesn't recognize her husband: they live apart most of the year, they really don't know each other well, they've never consummated the marriage, Michael is a master of disguise, Rachel hardly expects him to be doing what he's doing, and people tend to believe what they want to believe. Put all that together, and it's not quite so far-fetched for the short time that she's hoodwinked. She is still rather naive at that point in the story, after all.It's a 3 &amp; 1/2 star book, but I'm giving it 4 stars to help its overall rating. It's really not a bad book.

...such as the too easy ending for the missing sister, not enough urgency regarding said sister, and a mildly written and easy to figure out but creepy murder mystery...Metzger creates a delightful hero in Stony, a strong, independent heroine, and some truly wonderful and unique secondary characters. Moreover, her wit just sparkles, causing me to laugh out loud more often than I could possibly keep up with.While I have found Metzger's short stories to be hit or miss, this book made me a believer, and I'll try another of her full-length works soon. This one was delightful!

Actually, it wavers between 3-4 stars, depending on the exact part of the book. However, the humor and romance cause me to give it 4 stars.I liked Brandon St. John very much, but wasn't as crazy about Verena. Although spirited and witty, something about her just seemed conniving and untrustworthy.The blackmail scheme was rather odd at times, and not wholly convincing. Neither was Verena's family situation. On the other hand, wit abounds and there are significant sparks between the protagonists. The scene where Brandon has lost his voice may be my favorite in the book; the previous one when he's soaking wet is also quite good. The love scenes explode with passion. Verena's butler is a hoot. And Roger is one h*** of an actor.A good book and part of a splendid series, but not my favorite of the group.

Anthologies are notorious for the varied quality included. Not even Mary Balogh hits it every time. The Star of Bethlehem and No Room at the Inn was barely passable fare. The former had a harpy for the heroine and a contrived plot involving a ring and a climbing boy. Most of the story was a downer and just failed to connect with me. The latter experienced overload in the symbolism department, and the romance was simply unbelieveable.On the other hand, the other three entries were quite enjoyable. A Family Christmas is an emotional tale of misperceptions, misplaced pride, and erroneous fears. Although a bit simplistic at times, the story conjures up everything that's hopeful about fresh starts. The Best Gift exemplifies Balogh's mastery of deep emotions as she enables the reader to feel the heroine's loneliness and longing for a belongling and family. This is even more true with Playing House; I cried so often, I had to keep the Kleenex box handy. It is beautifully written and really touches the heart on many levels.3 out of 5 good stories in an anthology is pretty decent. Those three, especially the last two, are classic Balogh. The two stories that I disliked drag the rest down with their heavyhandedness. The book as a whole is somewhere between 3 & 4 stars, and I am hard-pressed to decide exactly where it falls. Read back to back, they develop an irritating sameness in places (like gathering the greens and decorating), but if I had read only the best three and/or divided them with other stories, I might have enjoyed them even more and not noticed the occasional repetitious feeling.

Yes, Dare was horrid to Georgiana once upon a time, but she never let him apologize either. The result, however, is possibly the most delightful series of put-downs, wisecracks, and barbed reparte that I have ever enjoyed. Dare is a thoroughly delightful man (aside from that one incident) with the most absurd sense of humor. Georgiana gleefully attacks him at every opportunity, often hitting the bull's eye...but it's all to mask the attraction and more that they feel for each other. And when Georgiana decides to get even, they both learn &quot;lessons in love.&quot;A darn near perfect love story.

I agree with the reviewer who said that the book would have been better without the chaos later on in the book. Neither Galen nor Moargot handled his sister and ex-fiancee well. However, other than than, the book was superb...one of Metzger's better efforts. Galen is quite wonderful, and while Margot is not as clearly drawn, she is still enchanting. The first half of the book is gloriously romantic. The second half focuses more on keeping the bad guy at bay and dealing with bi***y women. So the second half does falter. It's still enjoyable, just not as wonderful as the first half.There are moments when the reader can become confused at Metzger's style or annoyed with how the harridan women are not dealt with. Still, Metzger's trademark humor is in full force, and there's a sweetness about this romance that is entrancing. Until it dissolves almost into farce, the book is glorious. It recovers, but could have used more time to refocus on the romance after the chaos was all tidied up.For me, Metzger is all over the board. This one has some of her best writing, and some that's not. It may well be a matter of taste on this book. If you can put up with the sister and ex-fiance, without it damaging everything else, you'll really enjoy this book. The romance itself, especially the first half, rates 5 stars, but halfway through it gives way to the two "witches" and their antics. I enjoyed the book very much despite the near farce of the second half. This is definitely a time when partial stars are needed.

This was so bad that I couldn't read past chapter three -- and I almost always finish a book, even when it's bad. This is my first Connie Mason book. If I ever try another, it'll be a long time. Knights and serfs in mid-1700's Britain???

A Desperate Game is an engrossing read, but Reave is often emotionally cruel to Tessa. She wows the staff immediately but there's no reason given. She is also sometimes cruel back to Reave.The mystery is interesting, as is the historical ambiance, but the emotional abuse lowers it drastically in my book.Unfortunately, it's been a while since I read the book, so I'm giving it an average 3 stars.

I agree with the blot on Maggie's character, that she never really tried to "do the right thing" by letting Gray off the hook and admitting her own mistakes. But otherwise, she's a decent heroine, and Gray's a good hero. They play well off each other, and their interactions with secondary characters reveal a lot about these two.While this is not the best romance I've read, it has some very good qualities and is exceptional for a first novel. The true identity of Maggie's "husband" is obvious early on, but how it's all revealed to the characters is deliciously done. Richly emotional, although I wish the stuff with Gray's father had been resolved somehow. Still, a worthy read, and I'll be looking for more of her books.

Although the cast of characters will be familiar to Regency-era romance readers, Benson makes them her own with her sparkling dialogue and telltale details. It's a terrific book, and for a debut, it's spectacular. My only reason for giving it less than 5 stars is that I prefer my romances to have a strong emotional thread in them (other than humor). If you want to be touched by the book rather than just having your funny bone tickled, you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for a good time, this book is, in a word, fun.

I opened this one, having read in several places that it's one of her best. It's not. It plods along so slowly that I seriously considered tossing it several times. This is almost more a story about the Canadian wilderness than the two lovers. They rehashed the same territory in their relationship repeatedly. Joey's major goal was finding her parents. She does, with Luke's help, and then a few tears and quiet moments, and it's over. She's all better, time to move on. So unrealistic emotionally. Also there were a number of times that events seemed to happen only to present a situation for something else (the bear, for example) -- deux ex machina is not a good writing choice. Luke was compelling at times, but it took over half the book to get him there; for the longest time, he was just a guy with a chip on his shoulder. Cut the book in half, and you may have something. I'd skip it. BTW, Krinard has indicated that this contemporary work is connected to her historical books; but there's no explanation as to why these loup-garous are more wolflike than their ancestors. Weird. 2.5 stars.

As Regencies go, this one was pretty good. Lord Heartless isn't really heartless, in much of ANY sense. Really, it wasn't clear at all why he'd received that appellation. Only the author said so. But Hartleigh is quite amusing, sweet, and kind. And Carissa is a very strong heroine. Male cluelessness is the most common target for fun here. It's sweet with a bit of mystery, though the return of the husband was assured early on. Not particularly realistic, this story, but then I don't read for realism. Could have had more romance, in my opinion. I rate it somewhere around 3 & 1/2 stars.
