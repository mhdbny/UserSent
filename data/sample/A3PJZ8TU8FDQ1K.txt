Spacious and loaded with high quality features, this is an amazing tent for families of four, five and six. Add Eureka's StormShield construction and you have a family tent that should last until your kids grow up, graduate and move out of the house.Pros:* The tent is huge; we easily fit two full-size air mattresses in the tent with enough room to walk between them. We haven't tried to sleep more than four but you could do it if the group is wiling to spoon.* The vent drafts work well. We no longer wake up in a misty slathering of moist air and morning dew.* Construction is relatively easy; two people can easily put the tent together in under 20 minutes. The shockcorded fiberglass poles are helpful.* The tent is amazingly waterproof. We accidentally put the tent up in our back yard and forgot to turn off the sprinkler system. We caught the mistake but were surprised that it only took two towels to soak up the water that had reached the tent floor.Cons:* The list price is twice as high as what we paid for this tent.* The shockcorded fiberglass poles are heavy, so it is best to build with two people.The organizer gear loft and mesh storage pockets are greatly appreciated by our family because our two sons (ages 8 and 7) invariably hoard pocket toys, mini-flashlights, books and their Nintendo DS game machines in the tent. I appreciate that I no longer have to step around a minefield of their stuff inside the tent. Likewise, my youngest son no longer has to worry about finding a safe place to put his eyeglasses when he goes to sleep. The overhead gear loft keeps breakables safe.In summary, we purchased ourEureka! Bitterroot Tentin 2007 for $89.99 (I know, it was a great sale!) The tent is in excellent shape and I expect it will continue to serve our family well, whether in the backyard or in rougher climates.Rating: Five stars.

Amazon beats Wal-Mart! With The Amazing Spider-Man due in theaters in two days, Sony is offering $10 Movie Cash with your Blu-Ray purchase (promotion ends 8/3/12). You get Spider-Man 2 Blu-Ray and an UltraViolet Digital Copy for less than $2 ($11.96-$10.00 = $1.96). The same deal at Wal-Mart will cost you $1 more ($12.96) as of July 1, 2012.So, what's the bad news? Well, this is a single-disc edition, so you won't get all the extras included with the previous Blu-Ray release, specifically a gallery of 17 Alex Ross paintings that summarizedSpider-Manduring the sequel's opening sequence and a collectible comic book. If you are hanging by a (spider's) thread for these extra features, there's always theSpider-Man: The High Definition Trilogycurrently selling on Amazon for a shade under $50.These are the special features included with this Blu-ray reissue:* Commentary with cast and crew (Theatrical Version)* Technical commentary (Theatrical Version)* Commentary with Producer Laura Ziskin and Screen Writer Alvin Sargent(Extended Version)* Blooper Reel* 12 Part Making of -- Making the Amazing Featurette* Hero in Crisis Featurette* Ock-Umentary Featurette* Five-Part Visual Effects Breakdown* New Cover ArtWe watched the extended version last night with our sons (ages 9 and 8). My opinion mirrors many others: Spider-Man 2 was the best of the trilogy, with the best blend of action, comedy and drama. Kirstin Dunst drags down the narrative but, thankfully, spends much less time on screen than inSpider-Man 3. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octopus ("The power of the sun, in the palm of my hand!") and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson: ("Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma!") together elevate the movie with menace and humor, respectively.In summary, you won't want this Blu Ray Reissue if you already own the previous version. The Ultraviolet version is If not, you can't beat this offer (nice try, Wal-Mart) available until the end of August 2012.Rating: Four stars.

Tired of the same old side dishes - baked beans, corn on the cob and potato salad - at your BBQ and looking for a way to add more fresh garden vegetables to your grilling menu?We grill:* Summer squash, zucchini and garlic* Mushrooms, peppers and tomatoes* Onions, asparagus and beetsBy itself, this skillet is a great deal, with Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion this is simply a steal.Cleanup is easy. The skillet is rugged and the handle is easy to attach and detach over the grill. We can hold enough vegetables to feed 4-6 people.Here's what we like: slice up two bell peppers (red and yellow), one purple onion, and two cloves of garlic; add a gentle coat of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (you can just use black pepper if you don't like vinegar). We fill the skillet and place it over direct heat for about 5 minutes. Then, another five minutes over indirect heat.We do this, of course, during the last 10 minutes of roasting a full chicken on our Steven Raichlen Stainless Beer Can Chicken Rack with Drip Pan - don't forget Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion!)This fall, we're going to try pumpkin, acorn squash and sweet potatoes!

The 5-star reviews for this book ignore the fact that Jan Brett's illustrations are Hollywoodesque and distracting from the classic poem itself. Betraying the golden rule -- If it isn't broken, don't fix it -- Brett inserts in to additional characters. Nearly a third of the book features two unnamed elves who play with the toys and generally cause havoc on the roof as Santa fills the stockings.Instead of enhancing Clement Moore's poem, the illustrations scream for attention. The effect drowns out the lyrical quality of this classic story. Often on facing pages you are bombarded with two full-page illustrations bookended by six additional panels, three on each side. Your eyes can only skip and stutter across the pages or risk losing any semblance of a storyteller's cadence.This book was especially disappointing because earlier during that same bedtime reading session we enjoyedChristmas Magicby Sue Stainton and illustrated by Eva Melhuish. That book is an excellent example of how the marriage of story and illustrations can work magic for children.I wrote a 5-star review for a beautiful version of Clement Moore'sThe Night Before Christmasillustrated by Douglas W. Gorsline and recommend you buy that book instead. Don't give up hunting for an out-of-print copy, if necessary. Gorsline's illustrations are heartwarming and true to the original poem.

Stop buying bagged salad kits and save money on your grocery bill. Salad kits cost about $3-$4 per pound (most bags come in 12oz or 9oz sizes).This is a huge time saver for home-cooked meals. No more shaking wet lettuce in the sink! The spinner rotates quickly with a few light pushes. It also has a brake and the container can double as a storage bowl for leafy greens.The spinner works great for more than salad. Try cabbage for slaw, shrimp for cocktails and vegetable slices for grilling and baking.

Righteous Kill is like watching a rock band's reunion tour. Initial excitement to see them perform again washes away from the realization that their best years slipped away.Stunningly, 13 years appears to have made all the difference because it was Michael Mann's 1995Heatthat left film fans hungry for more. Heat marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, albeit briefly during the nearly three-hour film.Here De Niro and Pacino spend the entire film side by side and while the run time is about 100 minutes shorter than Heat, the effects are quite the opposite. They are weary. So are we. They are tired. And so on... The been-there-done-that-before story and leaden pacing are simply too much for two Academy Award-winning actors to save.Righteous Kill is a much larger disappointment to fans of the genre because it comes on the heels of two recent crime dramas that each won Best Picture -No Country for Old MenandThe Departed. Unable or unwilling to rise to the challenge, screenwriter Russell Gurwitz seemingly mined for gritty dialogue and rough sex inDeath Wishsequels.My advice is that you skip the De Niro-Pacino reunion tour and re-watch one of their better works:De Niro and Pacino - the aforementioned Heat andThe Godfather - The Coppola Restoration GiftsetPacino -Donnie Brasco (Special Edition)andCarlito's Way (Collector's Edition)De Niro -GoodFellasandCasino.

This silly story centers around self-responsibility. The children panic because they know their mother won't be happy if she comes home and find the house a mess. The fish fluctuates between being an annoyance and a voice of reason.The story stars a well-meaning cat who tries to release the children from an afternoon of boredom. He brings excitement, which quickly devolves into chaos...or so it seems.This is a fun bedtime story, nothing more, nothing less. My sons weren't looking for a debate about latch-key children and abandonment. We'll leave those reviews to the sociology graduates.If your children enjoy this book, I also recommend,The Cat in the Hat Comes Back.I couldn't imagine our children's bookshelf without these Dr. Suess books, too:The Cat in the HatGreen Eggs and HamHow the Grinch Stole ChristmasThe Lorax

Gross? Yes. Icky? Yes.In fact, this is the most vivid collection of bugs I've seen since I was enrolled in a natural science class. I wouldn't recommend reading this before or after dinner.However, the book is attracts my two young boys like moths to a porch light. They ask me all sorts of questions as to why one bug eats another or why a bug captures prey as a host for their eggs.Yep, I told you it was gross.If you have a young boy (or girl) who really like bugs, this is their book. Otherwise, look for some of the animal collections from the DK Readers collection or pick up a Berenstain Bears book. I've got Amazon reviews and Listmania lists of lots of other kids' books.We also have DK Readers books on snakes, spiders and micro monsters (bacteria and other tiny creatures).In summary, the DK Readers books are a great way to introduce natural science to young kids. Just be prepared for some vivid pictures if you are afraid of bugs yourself.Check out my other Amazon.com reviews of kids' books. Here's other DK Readers science books that I recommend:*DK Readers: Slinky, Scaly Snakes (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Munching, Crunching, Sniffing, and Snooping (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: The Secret Life of Trees (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Plants Bite Back! (Level 3: Reading Alone) (Paperback)*Micro Monsters: Life Under the Microscope (Paperback)

My review answers a simple question: is the Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo worth $20? Are you getting enough for your entertainment dollar? The answer is...yes.I say this with caution for two reasons. The first is that, while Snow White is inarguably a classic, the story's pacing is very, very slow. Children raised on Pixar films likeThe Incredibles,Finding Nemo,CarsandRatatouillemight not share their parents' fondness for Snow White. To be fair, most entertainment from 1937 cannot help but show its age more than 70 years later.The second reason for my cautious endorsement is that most of the extra features included in this package are of greater interest to parents instead of their children. So, do not be surprised if your child asks to leave the room after the movie ends while you stay behind, watching the "Disney Through The Decades" featurette or Don Hahn's nearly seven-minute discussion about the film's exposure sheet.In summary, for your entertainment dollar, this is a good investment. Just do not be surprised if it takes repeat viewings (and a little more maturity) before your children call it one of their favorites. Rating: Five stars.

My two sons (5-year old and 4-year old) have enjoyed this book for a couple years now. They imagine themselves as "little bears" and enjoy adding their own imagination to the book's different stories.I really liked the "Birthday Soup" chapter best and have used it to teach my sons that no matter how little you have, you always have enough to share.The book is a classic and you can add it to your storybook collection with Amazon's 4-for-3 special offer. I suggest you pick up "Little Bear's Friend" (see my review), too.

This is one of our first bedtime books for our sons along with "Hop on Pop" and "The Foot Book". This beginner's book provides simple rhymes that are easy to learn and repeat.We don't read this book as much anymore. We later graduated to "Fox in Socks." My oldest has returned to this book as an early reader. (I have to mix up the pages because my boys have much of the book memorized).

If you are making your living by writing you probably won't use this magazine as much as a hobbyist or a beginning writer.This magazine makes a nice gift subscription for friends or family who enjoy writing for a hobby. Each issue comes with 3-4 large features or how-to articles. These articles focus on different aspects of the writing life, including development, marketing and interviews with published authors, agents and editors of publishing houses.As other reviewers mentioned, most of the writing topics in this magazine and similar resources can be found online. That doesn't mean you should not buy a subscription as a gift.The magazine is perfect for an older person who is not comfortable with computers or someone who doesn't have access to a high-speed Internet service. The monthly assortment of articles helps to encourage and stimulate a beginning writer. There are gems for everyone that can be found in a one-year subscription to Writer's Digest.

Maxim rode the men's magazine gold rush in the late 1990s, leading Stuff, FHM and a host of other PG-13 fare that filled the convenience store racks as Playboy, Penthouse and the hard cores were either dropped completely or were tucked behind the clerk hidden behind individual black plastic wrappers.Maxim is the last Laddie still in print in the U.S., having witnessed the print burials for FHM (1996 to 2007) and Stuff (1998 to 2007). Maxim's putrefaction is evident to its subscribers, hence the heavily discounted subscriber rates available today. If you were unfortunate enough to receive a gift subscription to Maxim or, worse yet, bought one for yourself, you can no doubt bear witness to the decay. The magazine simply isn't interesting or compelling to read. You could find more of everything - women, entertainment, food and fashion - in a 10-minute Google search.Ask yourself, why are you buying a men's magazine?Want to admire beautiful women? ChoosePlayboyorPenthouse.Want to stay healthy and fit? ChooseMen's Health(preferred) orMen's Fitness(for younger audiences).Want to peruse fashion and lifestyle? ChooseEsquireorGQ(beware the cologne samples though).Want a little of everything? ChooseDetailsorMen's Journal.Pick any of the above options, especially if you are buying a gift subscription. Just avoid Maxim.

The years haven't been kind to this book. The illustrations are somewhat dated and, judging by the other reviews here on Amazon, there's an angry contingent of parents with abandonment issues who would rather you skip this book for a guide to raise Indigo Children.I'm just here to review a bedtime book for my two sons.More than with most books, I really have to act as I read this book to keep their attention. I'm the cow with a nasally Blue Blood voice, I'm the dog with a droopy drawl, and I'm the snort...SNORT!My boys like this book and we read it regularly at bedtime. Their bookshelf holds roughly 80-100 books and P.D. Eastman occupies two titles in our collection -- A Fish Out of Water and Are You My Mother?

We were browsing Amazon's Gold Box deals when we came across this four-pound box of treasure. Our family does a lot of holiday baking, sharing gift baskets filled with cookies, candies, and dessert bars and breads.These simply are outstanding cherries. They are tart and firm with a richness that we don't find in bulk foods stores. Both of our sons tried the cherries and gave us their "GG" thumbs-up review (that's "Good-Good" according to the under six-year old audience).We're thrilled with both the quality and the price of the Traverse Bay dried cherries. Since we're members of Amazon Prime (highly recommended!) shipping was simple.Of course, we're used to buying dried fruits in smaller quantities. We opened the boxy and divided all four pounds into individual sealed bags that can be stored in the refrigerator, the freezer or in a cool, dry cabinet. That was a piece of cake.In summary, if you are planning some holiday baking or other recipes that call for dried cherries, this is an excellent buy with a quality that will have you coming back for more.

My son had learned his ABCs. He could sound out words. He just couldn't take the plunge. This inspiring Christmas story helped him believe in himself.I bought this book from Amazon and added it to our rotation of bedtime reading. My son connected with Edward, the central character, who helps Santa make his Christmas deliveries by reading from the book of names.You could argue that I've rated this book a star higher than it deserves but since it was the book that inspired my son to read, I'll stand by my rating.

This Batman action figure comes with a zip action batarang and a detachable disc shooter. The toy is very durable. We've had ours for more than a year now and it gets heavily play with by my two sons, who take turns as the hero and villan.The only wear and tear is on Batman's forearm where the disc shooter snaps into place, a little of the paint has worn off. Otherwise, the toy is in excellent condition.This Batman even fits into the Batman Animated Batmobile by Mattel, which I've reviewed and added to my list of Batman action figures.

Parents and children can rejoice! It has taken nearly five years to release another full-length adaptation of a Dr. Seuss classic. The wait was worth it! "Horton Hears a Who" is far better than the wretched live-action films --Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)andDr. Seuss' The Cat In The Hat (2003).Jim Carrey is the voice of Horton, nearly repaying his debt to children from his earlier performance as the Grinch. Carrey is joined by Steve Carrell as the Mayor of Whoville. The voices talents are entertaining (even Charles Osgood manages to lighten up as the narrator) with the sole exception of Carol Burnett as the Kangaroo. Burnett's voice is scratchy, tired and annoying enough to pull you out of the animated magic when she speaks.Looking at the animated movies released in 2008, Horton Hears a Who is on par withKung Fu Panda- both films are a notch below Pixar'sWall-E, a notch above "Bolt" and "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa " but solidly ahead of the disastrousSpace Chimps. Of course, the pending release of "The Tale of Despereaux" could necessitate re-ranking the best animated films of 2008.In summary, this movie is a whimsical, funny story that never loses the spirit of the Dr. Seuss book,Horton Hears a WhoBTW: If your child wants to watch some more, pick up one of these animated DVDs instead of the live-action adaptations:Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Seuss Celebration (The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat / The Cat in the Hat/ Green Eggs and Ham / The Lorax)Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who

This book is a great value. I read this to my 5-year old and 4-year old at bedtime, dividing the stories into episodes. It takes 5-6 nights to read the entire book (15 minutes per night) if you leave time for questions. And my two little detectives have lots and lots of questions.None of the stories are too dark for young Batman fans. There's a good mix of illustrations but not so many that the book turns into a comic book.As for the added value, older Batman fans will pick this book up again and use it as an early reader. This book will spend many years on our sons' bookshelf.

My two sons (ages 5 and 4) beg me to read this book several times a week. It is one of their favorite bedtime stories.The first time I read this book they didn't care much for it. That's because I made several mistakes that are very important to making this book fun after repeated readings. Here's the five steps:1. Imitate Grover's voice. The mistake is to make Grover sound too deep. He's more like Yoda with a panic attack. Vibrate the back of your tongue like you're trying to gargle and let your voice climb when Grover is shouting.2. Don't forget the sound effects. There's bricks coming down, boards being hammered into place and Grover panting and screaming on every page.3. Let your children turn the pages while you plead to them to "don't turn the page!"4. Replace the words. After you read this book 5-6 times, you can spice it right back up by changing the words (e.g. "The Naked Gorilla at the End of this Book.")5. Use different Sesame Street characters. My sons ask for "The Count" most often as either a stand-in for Grover or as a companion through the story. "Three, three pages left before the end of the book, AH AH AH AH AH!"

This is one of my favorite dramas. The entire cast shines and this arguably the best work you've seen from Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis. A young Philip Seymour Hoffman is a treat and Jessica Tandy's final role makes this a must see.I like Richard Russo's books. I'm fond of "Mohawk" and "Empire Falls." However, this movie manages to be as good as the book without being a direct translation. Paul Newman makes all the difference.Newman won only one Oscar, Best Actor for his role in "The Color of Money" in 1986. I believe his work in 1994 was better with "Nobody's Fool" and "The Hudsucker Proxy."

Bless the Muppets. Their musical adaptation of Dickens' classic is perfect for young children and parents wanting to share the true meaning of Christmas.I preface I just finished writing a two-star review ofDisney's A Christmas Carol, a film I thought might supplant the Muppets version as our family's favorite Dickens adaptation. Unfortunately, Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, having failed to learn the lesson "less is more" created a jarring mess that lacks the charm needed for repeat viewings.Brian Henson directs his musical adaptation with an even tone (heartwarming and funny). Whether your children are familiar with the Muppets or not, the movie is accessible for young children (think ages 5 to 10) thanks to Gonzo the Great's gentle narration (as Charles Dickens). My sons could easily follow the story and understand the messages of love and good will toward all.The cast is a mix of Muppets and human actors with Michael Caine in the lead as Scrooge. Caine's Scrooge is kid-friendly, not so mean and cruel as to be nightmare-inducing. Yet, he manages a heartwarming transformation with each ghost visit that ultimately leaves Miss Piggy (as Bob Cratchit's wife, Emily) speechless.My sons (ages 8 and 6) first enjoyed this DVD in the comfort of our home. I think that might be a key reason why the movie received such harsh reviews when released in December 1992. This movie is a much better experience shared at home with parents and young children huddled together on the sofa than at a movie theater. This movie competed againstAladdinandHome Alone 2, a film that hasn't aged well. Sadly, "Home Alone 2" was rereleased on Blu-Ray before either "Aladdin" orThe Muppet Christmas Carol. I can only imagine that families with children of a mix of ages begrudgingly purchased tickets for the Muppets instead of Macaulay Culkin's sequel.Rating: Four stars. (One star dropped for the bungled packaging - the missing song - and the fact that no Blu-Ray version of the film exists).

The Dark Knight joins a group of guy films --The Godfather,The Godfather Part II,Die Hard,GoodFellas,No Country for Old Men,Lonesome DoveandThe Shawshank Redemptionto name a few -- that your husband or boyfriend will watch again and again over his lifetime.All of these movies share flawed heroes, a seemingly unstoppable chain of violence and fatal acts of sacrifice. They are the modern day equivalent of epic poems and campfire tales, illustrating the moral dilemmas of fighting evil with evil and contemplating whether the world still needs heroes at all.Clocking in at just over two-and-a-half hours, the theatrical cut is slightly weighed down by several brooding speeches. However, the Joker's relentless assault never lets you rest. Make no mistake, The Dark Knight is an action film. However, the film also delivers as a thought-provoking tragedy and, in doing so, sets itself apart from every superhero film that came before it.P.S. Parents need to use caution. The PG-13 rating hardly reflects the film's violence and sadism. I couldn't recall another PG-13 film that had as much implied violence even though much occurs off screen. Teenagers can handle the dark crime story but this superhero film is not suitable for young children.As the parent of two sons, a 6-year-old and a 4-year old, I turn to these other, more age-appropriate Batman DVDs for my die-hard superhero fans:Batman - The Animated SeriesandThe Batman. Check out my other superhero-related Amazon lists for parents.

I'm a deer in the headlights. A green horn; so new to podcasting that I'm fumbling around, trying to pick up hints and tips while learning the best practices of the industry. I've bought almost all of my equipment from Amazon.com, which is how I ran across this book as a recommendation.Initially, I was a little concerned the material might be outdated, considering the 2005 publication date. However,Podcast Solutions - The Complete Guide to Podcastingby Michael W. Geoghegan and Dan Klass continues to serve as an excellent guide, especially as I weigh my equipment options and build the framework for a two-person podcast.The book covers everything from basic terminology and planning to marketing approaches to expanding audience and making money. I've focused mainly on the technical advice, such as `Podcasting Tools;' `Recording Your Podcast;' `Putting It All Together;' `Preparing Your File;' and `Serving It Up.'The included CD offers trial versions of software but we have decided to stick with Audacity for now.In summary,Podcast Solutions - The Complete Guide to Podcastingis a great value because the book's cost is far exceeded by the time and equipment savings I have benefitted from by reading it. I deduct one star from my review rating because the book needs updating; the fundamentals are sound but seven years is a lifetime in media.Until an update is published, I recommend this guide as the best foundation for new users.Rating: Four stars.

Our last pair of J.A. Henckels International Kitchen Shears delivered more than a decade of great service before the handle cracked. We retired that pair and purchased another for less than $16 from Amazon without blinking an eye. These shears cut through bones, ribs, cardboard boxes and everything else we needed in the kitchen.At the time we replaced the shears, the steel blades were still sharp and the serrated metal handle insert was in perfect working order. I assume the reason the shears lasted so long is that we didn't put them in the dishwasher as per the manufacturer's recommendation. We used a child's toothbrush to clean the hard-to-reach areas between the blades.In summary, you can spend more on a pair of kitchen shears but why would you want to when you can get years of great service from J.A. Henckels International Kitchen Shears.Rating: five stars.

Parents of young children looking for picture books to introduce Halloween and its customs could do worse than this book. The titular character is trying to find a scary costume for Halloween. His three friends, the Diplodocus, the Stegosaurus and the Iguanodan, help him in his quest.There is nothing remotely scary about this book and that is a plus. The vocabulary and tone are best for the preschool audience. Parents may balk at the sight of apples, baked goods and other handmade goodies but this book is not intended to be a step-by-step safety guide for Halloween. Instead, it is a fun Halloween adventure that tackles one of the biggest anxieties kids face: What will I wear?My sons (ages 8 and 7) didn't find the book as interesting as another Halloween-themed picture book,The Ghost of Nicholas Greebe, we recently read. However, that reflects their ages and the volume of bedtime books we read, not any particular fault with this book.In summary, I recommend this picture book for children ages 4-7. The light-hearted story won't leave a lasting impression but it will make a fun introduction to Halloween.

Lipton Green Tea To Go packs are handy when at home, at the office and when you're on the road and want to avoid drinking your calories.The packages are easy to carry and I keep a box at my office and several packets in my glove box. I've reviewed several of the Lipton and Crystal Light products.I like the ice teas best. Lipton's teas are less sweet, more adult-tasting than Crystal Light's mixes. Both are a nice change of pace from drinking plain water and I've found that I enjoy it best when it is slushy cold.Here's my recipe for a perfect drink: I add the powder to myRubbermaid Chug Bottle, an inexpensive water bottle perfect for Lipton packets (check out my Amazon review), then I add 12 oz of water and fill the rest of the bottle with crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking I've got an ice-cold drink both cheaper and better tasting than diet soda.Bottom line: You want to avoid the soda machine and save money by skipping bottled teas. These drink mixes are handy at home, at the office and on the road - anywhere you want to avoid drinking your calories.Crystal Light On the Go, Peach TeaCrystal Light Raspberry Lemonade On-The-GoLipton White Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, RaspberryLipton Green Tea To Go, Mandarin and MangoCrystal Light On the Go, Raspberry IceCrystal Light On-the-Go Live Active Natural Mixed Berry

There's not much to this game and that's the charm for young players. Each player has colored swords they stick in the barrel and one sword activates the pirate, which pops out.This is a perfect family game for parents to play with children ages 2-4. The game is easy to understand and there's plenty of giggling when the pirate pops up. Each game lasts about five minutes, so there was plenty of time to play it multiple times before the kids grew tired. This also ensured that more than one player won.We played with our Pop-Up Pirate for about a year before our sons grew beyond it. Now, we play Othello and chess and dominoes.

My two young sons (now ages 6 and 4) have a large collection of DK Readers books. They love snakes, spiders, bugs and micro monsters (ugh).I regularly read these to my sons at bedtime. The books are not scary (there's no blood & guts), so don't worry about nightmares. Nope, these books are gold mines of vocabulary words. Trust me, six-year old have no problem slipping in "egg-eating snake" and "molting" into a conversation...even at the dinner table.A young boy or girl who really like snakes will love this book.Check out my other Amazon.com reviews of kids books. Here's other DK Readers science books that I recommend:*DK Readers: Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Munching, Crunching, Sniffing, and Snooping (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: The Secret Life of Trees (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Plants Bite Back! (Level 3: Reading Alone) (Paperback)*Micro Monsters: Life Under the Microscope (Paperback)

Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham's latest DVD features his big three -- Walter, Peanut & Achmed -- for a light-hearted adult comedy that breaks up the stress of holiday season.Filmed before a live audience at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, WI, the show doesn't cover a lot of new territory but die-hard fans won't be disappointed because Jeff incorporates new jokes into his famous group of adult puppets.If this your first experience with Jeff's ventriloquist comedy, you should also tryJeff Dunham - Arguing With MyselforJeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity.I also recommend these Christmas comedies for Jeff Dunham fans:National Lampoon's Christmas VacationPlanes, Trains and AutomobilesHome Alone

My sons (ages 6 and 4) love this new animated series, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The show is much better suited for younger audiences than Spider-Man's last animated series, which lasted only one season on MTV in 2003.This series features all of Spider-Man's most famous villians, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Rhino and Electro.If you absolutely must buy a DVD right now (birthday present, etc.) this is a good choice for Spider-Man fans. Amazon has the DVD priced $5 below suggested retail price ($19.95) and this is a good choice for young children who love Spider-Man.The more economical decision is to wait for a DVD set release of all 26 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2, which should be priced around $30. It was announced earlier this year that Season 2 would move from the CW network to Disney XD. Season 2 is scheduled to begin in March 2009. However, the Spectacular Spider-Man ended production after completing the 26th episode (the end of Season 2). A third season might happen, depending on the ratings Season 2 gets on Disney XD.There are other Spectacular Spider-Man gift options to consider if you hold off on the DVD purchase. Amazon has a great set of action figures modeled that were modeled from the animated series. I recommend the action figures listed below but check out my Amazon lists for other superhero toys and books.One final note on these action figures: we paid about $5 each but many collectors have driven up prices to more than $20 each. Compare Amazon sellers and be selective. You can still find affordable action figures on Amazon but you need to do some research.Spiderman Animated Action Figure - Spider-ManSpiderman Animated Action Figure Black-Suited SpidermanSpiderman Animated Action Figure - Doc OctopusSpiderman Animated Action Figure - VenomSpiderman Animated Action Figure - Green GoblinSpiderman Animated Action Figure - SandmanSpiderman Animated Action Figure - ElectroSpiderman Animated Action Figure - RhinoSpiderman Animated Action Figure - LizardIn summary, I'd rate The Spectacular Spider-Man series four stars based on the entertainment value for young superhero fans. The shows are accessible without being too scary or adult for the under-10 audience. However, by marketing the first season into four DVDs, I deduct three stars. The series is overpriced, especially in light of the current economy.

This Clayface design comes from "The Batman", the animated show on the WB.My sons loved the design but this action figure wasn't durable enough to withstand their gameplay. I'm still looking for a stronger action figure to replace this one, which only lasted about four months before the arms were pulled out of the sockets.

If you think horseradish only goes with roasted prime rib you're missing out on some great culinary pairings. Creamy horseradish is a delicious addition to mashed potatoes (and as a topping on baked potatoes), cole slaw, sausages and smoked fish. It also adds a nice kick to party dips.I recently matchedBeaver Brand Cream Style Horseradishwith a couple tri-tip roasts. BTW: Tri-tip roasts are one of the beef industry's best kept secrets. Cooked correctly, they are juicy, flavorful and offer a great value if you're trying to cut your grocery bill.I like Beaver Brand (Made in Oregon!) better thanKraft Horseradish Sauce, which tastes more like a flavored mayonaise than a creamy horseradish. Not surprisingly, Kraft has twice as many calories (20 calories per tsp serving) than Beaver Brand (10 calories per tsp serving)!In addition, the squeeze bottle is handy, making it easy to carry this condiment for a picnic lunch of smoked fish, goat cheese and a crusty baguette on the Oregon coast. Backyard barbecue? Enjoy a dab of creamy horseradish with your grilled bratwurst and add a dab to your potato salad recipe.According to the Beaverton Foods web site, the company has received more than 100 certificates of excellence and awards for quality--more than all the other mustard manufactures combined. Beaver Brand also producesInglehoffer Cream Style Horseradish(I recommend this hotter version, too!) andInglehoffer Extra Hot Horseradish Mustard, which was named Grand Champion in the World Mustard Championships.In summary, Beaver Brand creamy horseradish is great addition to your menu, providing lots of flavor without piling on the calories.

I purchased this mandolin slicer after seeing it on the Food Network. For the price, this is an excellent slicer. I know there are mandolins on the market for $200 or more but I don't have any need to spend more money. This slicer does everything I need.Slice vegetables and fruits thick or thin. The holder protects your fingers from the sharp blade. The one tip to remember is that you don't want to overload the slicer. Keep the vegetable and fruit pieces manageable and you won't have any trouble keeping the slicer steady on the counter.We have two young sons, so mixing up the presentation is important to keep them from getting bored. They like the large, thin vegetable slices for lunch as finger foods. We don't buy bagged salad kits anymore. Salad kits cost about $3-$4 per pound (most bags come in 9oz or 12oz sizes).With this tool and theOXO salad spinnerwe have a wonderful salad in minutes.

Sometimes we just can't seem to settle down before bed. During those times, I reach for "Where the Wild Things Are" so that my two sons can roar their terrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth and roll their terrible eyes and show their terrible claws.The book is short -- perfect for bedtime reading -- and very interactive. The story follows Max and his wild imagination to a magical land. I use the book to reinforce in my sons that they need to settle down in the evening and not get into the type of mischief Max falls into.This is a great addition to your bedtime reading collection.

This is a great toy for a weekend, for a costume party, for Halloween. Older kids will enjoy it more than younger children. The helmet has straps but they can only do so much to keep it upright.The pre-programmed voices are best. I wish there had been more of them. The voice changing feature works but it makes you sound more like a generic robot than a Transformer.This was a gift for our 4-year old son. It was a nice gift and made for a couple days of fun but he had more fun with a handful of Transformers action figures.Now, give this to a 40-year old Transformers fan with a case of nostalgia and he'll likely rate this helmet five stars.

We purchased Perfection to entertain about 15 children at our son's seventh birthday party. We set up a game table and placed Perfection alongside four other games -iPlay Wok and Roll,Operation,Wild Planet Hyper DashandTwister(I recommend you check out my Amazon reviews on these other games, too).Here is what you want to know:Is it just as much fun as I remember? YES!You don't need batteries to play? YES!Is it a good value for the price? YES!If you are unfamiliar with this classic game, the gameplay is simple: fit 25 different shaped pieces into their appropriate place before the 60-second alarm goes off, launching the tray and your pieces into the air (trust me, it isn't as dangerous as it sounds). Kids learn geometric shapes, build speed and accuracy, and no turn last more than 60 seconds, so everyone gets plenty of opportunities to play.Perfection's ticking alarm ratchets up the suspense. You simply turn the dial and it starts ticking down the seconds until the board erupts (really fun to see the clock rattle adults). Finally, a nice feature is a built-in compartment in the back of the Perfection board allows you to store all 25 pieces.In summary, Perfection is easy to learn but hard to master, proving that children and adults can still enjoy an indoor game without batteries. The game is an excellent value for the price. Rating: Five stars

We purchased the Melissa and Doug Wooden Sushi set along with the Melissa and Doug Cutting Food Box for our sons at Christmas (see my Amazon review). It was great to mix and match foods from two cultures!Here's four reasons we enjoyed this toy so much:1. It was perfect for quiet play and indoor play during winter.2. We reinforced good eating habits during meals with the playset.3. Our sons learned a lot of vocabulary, especially verbs like cut, slice, chop, and mix.4. Our sons had lots of FUN playing with the food box!I'm a big fan of Melissa and Doug products: fun, educational and durable. You can check my other Amazon reviews of their floor puzzles.

We have a 5-year old and a 4-year old, so finding games, puzzles and activities that the whole family can enjoy together is very important to us. This floor puzzle is large enough we can all enjoy it together.We own more than 25 jigsaw puzzles, including 4 floor puzzles from Melissa and Doug. This 100-piece puzzle is large, so it is easy for both of our children to handle the pieces.Of all the jigsaw puzzles we own, Melissa and Doug puzzles are the most durable.

I started reading this book to my sons several years ago. I liked the illustrations and the rhyme and found that with a quick hand turning pages, I could sing it to them as well as I could read it. My sons used to repeat the chorus, "...and, I Love You."Over the years, we've developed a three-part harmony (trust me, it isn't as good as it might sound) and we sing to their mother at bedtime. The book has also been reintroduced as an early reader, now that they are 5-years old and 4-years old.This item is eligible for Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion as I write this review, which means you're getting a great value whether this is for your children or to be given as a gift.I recommend it for your bedtime reading collection, for children ages one to six.

I've subscribed to ESPN and The Sporting News for a couple years now. When my subscriptions end, I won't be renewing ESPN.I want detailed sports information, in-depth stories and the kind of details I can't find in my morning copy of USA Today. Instead, ESPN delivers a Maxim-esque version of sports with lots of popular culture reference and clip art. And plenty of ads for gold jewelry, cell phones and men's body spray.I used to complain more but I've come to realize the magazine is a reflection of SportsCenter -- a show that has devolved into a series of annoying euphemisms for home runs, slam dunks and touchdowns.Bottom line: If you love SportsCenter, you'll love ESPN magazine. If not, look at the newly-redesigned The Sporting News or Sports Illustrated.

Marla Frazee lets her illustrations do most of the talking in this delightful Christmas story that provides young children insight into Santa's passion for toys.This story details all the behind-the-scenes work Santa is involved in leading up to and after Christmas day. As the world's number one toy expert, Santa goes to great lengths to ensure each toy is fun, sturdy and matches the child who will receive it.My two sons, ages 6 and 4, immediately giggled at the book's cover, a drawing of Santa bouncing along on a pogo stick in his suspenders and candy cane short pants.Santa's ever-changing wardrobe is one of the rib-tickling reasons this book is fun to read again and again. I had to go back and check my memory to make sure I was right because Santa never appears in his famous red coat and pants in this book. Parents will chuckle, too, at the rapidly increasing number of coffee mugs scattered in Santa's workshop as he works long hours in the final days before Christmas.In summary, this is a great addition to your Christmas story book collection for young readers and preschoolers. It might even make a fun coffee table book at a Christmas party.

I purchased this slow cooker more than a year ago on Amazon as a replacement for a Rival crockpot (you can find my review).We use this slow cooker often, more so in the fall and winter than summer. I really like the "keep warm" feature, which fits our busier nights when we can't eat together as a family.If you read some of the other reviews, this product is rated lower because it doesn't have a timer. Don't let that stop you from buying this slow cooker. After bad experiences with other brands, I hesitated to add my review right after purchase. Now, more than a year after our purchase, I can honestly say this is the best slow cooker I've ever owned.This is easy to clean, easy to operate and holds enough food to feed a family of four. Thank you, West Bend and Amazon.I give it four stars with the only negative being that the handles should be a tad longer because of the product's weight.

Do you remember when Matthew McConaughey was more than a walking Mexican beer holder with six-pack abs and a George Hamilton tan? It was 1996 and McConaughey headlined the film version of John Grisham's first novel to more than $100 million in US gross, a heady figure for an R-rated courtroom drama that explores racial tension and capital punishment.McConaughey stars as Jake Brigance, a young, hotshot Mississippi lawyer. His client is Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee Hailey, a blue-collar father on trial for delivering M-16 justice on two men who beat and raped his 10-year-old daughter, Tonya.Surrounding McConaughey and Jackson is a solid cast - Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roarke, a Boston law student and volunteer aide; Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley, a shark-toothed district attorney; Donald Sutherland as Lucien Wilbanks, a disbarred and drunken mentor of Jake's; Ashley Judd as Jake's wife; Patrick McGoohan as a prosecutor's dream judge (aptly named "Noose"); and Oliver Platt as Harry Rex Vonner, a disreputable lawyer and Jake's best friend.The amazing depth of supporting actors also includes Keifer Sutherland (24), Chris Cooper (Adaptation), Charles Dutton, Brenda Fricker, M. Emmet Walsh, Kurtwood Smith (That '70s Show) and Anthony Heald (The Silence of the Lambs).The movie runs nearly two-and-a-half hours, which allows plenty of time for each actor to steal a scene, if not two. Director Joel Schumacher skillfully builds tension - often, outside the courtroom - while maintaining a pace that keeps the movie entertaining and thought provoking instead of a preachy diatribe. "A Time to Kill" is R-rated for good reason; yet neither the adult language or violence feels gratuitous given the storyline.I strongly recommend Grishham's novelA Time to Killif you enjoy the movie. The movie necessitated changing the book's climactic scene and yet both versions work in their own form.In summary, despite the fact that "A Time to Kill" remains overshadowed by the box office receipts and celebrity found in other Grisham films, this movie has aged well. It is a treat to watch McConaughey, Jackson and Spacey. The depth of acting talent brought together for this film is stunning; you'll find yourself recognizing many faces that can attribute their later success in part to their role in this movie.Rating: Five stars

Buying lunch every day was getting very expensive. And eating sandwiches from home got boring quick.That's when I stumbled across the Zojirushi Mr. Bento available on Amazon. I spent nearly seven years in Japan and enjoyed the traditional Japanese lunch bento. With a few modifications to the menu, I'm able to fill the round jar with four food bowls. The two largest bowls can hold a serving of pasta, soup or stew, or simply grilled chicken and vegetables and rice. The two smaller bowls are perfect for carrying fruit and snacks or side dishes to accompany the main course. Each bowl is vacuum-insulated, so it keeps food warm.Don't be intimidated. You need not prepare Japanese or Asian foods to use this lunch box. The containers can accomodate many foods. More often than not, I simply collect several leftovers in the bowls and toss in some fruit to go with it and I've got a lunch that is tastier and healthier than what I used to buy.Trust me. You'll not only save money with this lunch box, you will also be the envy of your co-workers/classmates.

If you're suspicious of the book's theme, trust that neither of my sons, now ages 5 and 4, rise up out of the beds and declare war against American industry after a bedtime reading. They like the Barbaloots. They like the mossy voice I give the Lorax.The message I share with them is not to waste natural resources. There's nothing wrong with cutting down a tree (it makes great books!) but plant a new one. There's nothing wrong with fishing and hunting but eat what you collect. I applaud Dr. Suess for reaching beyond his "Cat in the Hat" fare and offering up a deeper story.Have extremists on both sides used the book for their cause? Sure. But I'm reviewing this book for the bedtime book audience who wants to know if this is appropriate for young children. The answer is yes, in fact it is.This is a beautiful book with unforgettable characters and I hope it helps you teach your children to appreciate nature.

More than anything else, this Morris story helped ease the fears my two sons, now ages 6 and 4, had about starting school. With a childlike innocence, Morris makes simple errors that cause a bit of giggling in the classroom. However, the teacher's gentle direction keeps the other children laughing with Morris instead of laughing at him.I introduced this book into our bedtime reading rotation prior to my sons starting pre-kindergarten and continued to read it for a couple months after they started school. The book had sat on their bookshelf since then but now my eldest son has found it again as he's exploring early reader books. The book's classroom setting gives him common ground from which to build his reading comprehension.In summary, while this book is not as funny as Morris' previous adventures, I still recommend this book if your child is about to begin attending school. The story helps ease concerns about the classroom.

He's cute. He's silly. Curious George steps from his famed children's books and, for a blessed 86 minutes, delivers pure family entertainment both charming and funny.The man with the yellow hat now has a name, Ted (Will Ferrell), and a new career as a Bloomsberry Museum tour guide. I had misgivings when I saw Ferrell's name. His other comedies are not G-rated entertainment and I wasn't interested in exposing my sons (ages 8 and 6) to Ferrell'sSaturday Night Liveshtick. There's nothing to fear though.The movie's G-rating could stand for "gentle," a pleasant change of pace from other kids fare such as the G-rated (for "gross")Space Chimpsand the PG-ratedPlanet 51andOpen Season. Curious George's charm is that he generates laughs without trafficking in the rude humor - defecating, passing gas, profanity - now so common in animated children's movies.Joining Ferrell are Drew Barrymore, Dick Van Dyke, Eugene Levy, David Cross and Frank Welker as George. The voice work is good but, most importantly, the stars don't distract from the animation like the odd pairing of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus did inBolt.In summary, Universal Pictures deserves much credit for maintaining the character's innocence after what I've read was a long, drawn-out process to bring Curious George to film. While the film doesn't quite reach classic status, it makes for a wonderful family movie night and will entertain children ages 8 and younger. Rating: Four stars.UPDATE: We held a kids movie night, pairing Curious George with cheese pizza, 40 bananas (in lieu of popcorn) andNeon Monkey Tattoos. The theme party was successful. I recommend you "Make it a Monkey Movie Night!"

Let me start by saying that the illustrations are excellent. The titular crocodile comes alive. With a body drawn more like a sausage roll with legs than that of a swift, deadly predator, the crocodile is depicted in various stages of angst and grief as his idyllic world is turned upside down.Whisked away by Napoleon (yes, that Napoleon), the crocodile travels from his home along the Nile to Paris where he become a fountain display. At first a star among Parisians, the crocodile quickly loses favor and turns to his primal nature to survive.Overall, my sons (ages 6 and 4) liked this book as a bedtime story. However, I had to edit the story in two places because I thought the content was inappropriate for young children. Here are two excerpts from the book:..."In fact, the great Pharaohs themselves treated my ancestors like Gods! Idol worship - I just love it! That's why I always resisted eating people, even though they do look awfully tasty."..."After all. I was stuck in Paris! What was a starving crocodile supposed to eat? [Here, the crocodile pulls a woman off the street and into the sewers where he eats her (but we don't see that).] Yummy! Now what's for dessert?" [The illustration shows the crocodile cleaning his teeth with a feather from the woman's hat.]The illustrations earn a 4-star rating but I have to withdraw one star because the story includes references to idol worship and human victims (the crocodile could've eaten a rat). In summary, this is a unique story for a children's picture book but some of the content isn't appropriate for younger children.

My wife grinds her teeth. She sets her molars and emits a pulverizing sound that mauls me out of a deep sleep. For years, I simply nudged the bear until her crunching stopped. Or I retreated from our bedroom quarry for the peace and quiet of the guest bedroom.A conversation about our family health plan reminded me that a co-worker recently went to her dentist for a custom-fit mouth guard. She received a bill for $500 and (surprise) learned that her insurance would not cover the expense.Equally appalled at the dentist and the health care provider, I researched a more affordable solution and purchased this kit. My wife was not thrilled but agreed to try it. TheDental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mouth Guard Kitcomes with two mouth guards. Following the simple instructions, we prepared the smaller of the two mouth guards in less than five minutes.The first night was heavenly, all peace and quiet. My wife said the mouth guard wasn't uncomfortable to wear but she still preferred to sleep without it. I reread the kit instructions and shared the suggestion that she wear the guard an hour before bedtime to adjust to the feeling. On hindsight, I probably shouldn't have laughed when she tried to talk with the guard in her mouth. Imitating her garbled speech wasn't a good move either.In summary, this is a great kit and an affordable solution for grinding teeth (bruxism). I will post an update if/when she grinds through the mouth guard. My hope is that it lasts at least a year.Rating: Five stars.

Along with "Little Bear" we have this book on my sons' bookshelf and read it often as part of our bedtime routine.My two sons (5-year old and 4-year old) have enjoyed this book now for a couple years. They see themselves as "little bears" and enjoy adding their own imagination to the book's storylines.This book introduces a new character, Emily, and reinforces wonderful messages of friendship and sharing that were introduced in "Little Bear."The book is a classic and you can add it to your storybook collection with Amazon's 4-for-3 special offer. I suggest you also pick up "Little Bear" (see my review).

Magic and mystery await your children with this lush retelling from Arabian Nights a.k.a One Thousand and One Nights....The child is young....The day is old....My story is waiting....It wants to be told.A poor fisherman living by the shores of the Arabian Sea unleashes a genie who intends to repay him with death. The fisherman shares two fables warning that evil will be repaid with evil. As foreboding as that sounds, the story ends happily as the genie, undaunted by the stories, is finally bested when the fisherman outfoxes him.The story is delivered with vocabulary befitting younger readers (Publishers Weekly recommends ages 5-9 and the School Library Journal recommends grades 3-6). As my sons are a bit younger (ages 6 and 4) than the target audience I chose to read this book as a bedtime story. Captivated by Amiko Hirao's illustrations, brimming with orange, blue and purple pastels, they frequently asked me to turn back to see the pictures again.The moral of the book is do not reward a good deed with evil, i.e. unkindness or disrespect. This is an excellent retelling of classic fables and earns our 5-star rating....The rising of the moon....The setting of the sun....The teller is tired....The story is done.

There's so much silliness and tongue twisting going on in "Fox in Socks" that my 5-year old and 4-year old end up rolling around in their beds because they laugh so hard.This is one of my sons' favorite bedtime books. Initially, the book provided new vocabulary but, now they have got the book nearly memorized, the main attraction is the tongue-twisting rhymes Mr. Fox delivers.You can't read "tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle" without any seriousness and that's the point of Dr. Suess books. Check the seriousness at the door and dive into the silliness with your children.I recommend you add these Dr. Suess books to your kids' bookshelf:One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue FishGreen Eggs and HamHop on PopThe Foot BookThe Cat in the Hat

We bought this book along withThe Berenstain Bears and the Bad DreamandThe Berenstain Bears and the Blame Game.just before Christmas. I wrote Amazon reviews for those books, so please check them out.I'm sorry to say this title is not up to par with the best of the Berenstain Bears series (I've listed several of our favorites below).The story follows both young bears' habit of visiting friends and returning home with a laundry list of "I wants" that drives Mama Bear crazy. However, the book strangely ends with Mama and Papa Bear talking about spoiling their kids with more toys so the parents can "count their blessings."A powerful rainstorm and subsequent power outage are used to illustrate the blessings of home and family. That's a good start but the book leaves out much. The story doesn't mention anyone less fortunate than the Berenstain Bears family, which leaves a hole in the moral of the story. I had hoped to use the book to launch a discussion with my young sons about counting your blessings, especially during the holidays, as well as to share some of our good fortune with others. Sadly, the book didn't provide much of a springboard.That said, our sons, ages 6 and 4, enjoy many of the Berenstain Bears books (we own more than 10 titles now) and find it easy to relate to the young bears in the series. I like to mix these stories into our rotation of bedtime books to reinforce good manners and behaviors.While I recommend the Berenstain books listed below, we've run into a new problem: the characters don't evolve. My sons are asking why brother and sister bear didn't learn from the last book. The good news is that my sons remember the lessons; the bad news is that the Berenstain bears don't.I also recommend these Berenstain books:The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Help Around the HouseThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears Learn About StrangersThe Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TV

I bought this press pot back in May 2007. I post my reviews on kitchen tools and appliances later, so that I can report on the durability.The Bodum 8-Cup provides enough coffee for my wife and I to start our morning. We use extra large coffee mugs(check out my review of the fantastic Pfaltzgraff Mystic Coffee Mugs), so we get two full mugs with each pot.Other reviews cite problems with the filter but that's not been my experience. Like other buyers, I was taken aback by the initial cost of a stainless-steel press pot but I didn't want to go through the experience of another glass pot. Every glass pot I've owned before has broken and the last one nearly cut the back of my wife's fingers as she was cleaning it.We stopped buying coffee at stands when we bought this press pot. At $2-$4 a cup, we've saved hundreds of dollars in the first year alone.I then bought theThermos Nissan 34-Ounce Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle(see my review) and started taking a second pot of coffee to work.The Bodum stainless-steel press pot is durable, produces great-tasting coffee and saves us money.

I really wanted this book to catch on with my two sons during our bedtime reading. I liked the concept of showing that one action creates another and another. However, the book didn't work and here's why:1. The narrator doesn't have a voice. Put this againstGreen Eggs and Hamwhere you've got two distinct voices playing off each other orMonster at the End of this Bookwhere Grover's voice goes from whisper to yelling and finally back down to a whimper. This book doesn't help bedtime readers. I might as well have read a motorcycle manual.2. The story wears on you just as the mouse wears on the boy. I thought it was telling that near the end of the book, the boy in the story falls asleep in a rocking chair. The actions didn't get sillier or funnier or more intesting; there was just one right after another.3. What the mouse does beyond eating a cookie isn't neither creative nor interesting. For a small character in a big world, choose instead the classic "Jack in the Beanstalk" or a mouse with character,Stuart Little.In summary, I give it 3 out of 5 stars. This makes a fair early reader book but your children will quickly leave it behind for more engaging stories.

We bought this along with the Spider-Man Interactive 14" and watched as our two young boys pushed the remote controls and watched as the figures traded quips and made fighting movements.And we watched it again.And again.By the fourth round, even our kids were tired of the toys, because you can't "do" anything else with them. They are bulky and require the plastic stands to stand upright (there are little pegs that snap into the characters' feet).Luckily, I was able to use rechargable AAA batteries. A couple days later, we slipped the batteries out of the toys and put them to use elsewhere in the house. Our kids never noticed.If you are looking for some kid-friendly, Spider-Man action figures, check out the Hasbro line from the new WB cartoon series, "The Spectacular Spider-Man."If you are looking for a talking lamp, minus the light, buy this.

I first wrote my Amazon review of the book because, after watching this movie, I was interested to see for myself how much of the screenplay actually came word-for-word from the book.Although many parts of the book,No Country for Old Men, appear in the movie, don't cheat yourself by missing out on the story in both media.I mentionedThe Godfatherbecause I made a point of reading the Mario Puzo book after watching that movie. As always happens, the movie had to trim away scenes and characters but the heart of the story remained intact.The Coen brothers had a lot less cutting to do from the source material in making No Country for Old Men. Regardless, the movie and the book both stand up well to repeated viewings and readings.BTW: Here's my five-star review of the book:I'm a fan of the Coen Brothers, so their attachment to this book is what drew me to the movie first. I hadn't read Cormac McCarthy's other books, so this story was a nice introduction to his fiction and I look forward to delving into his other works.The book is a modern-day western. My review follows more than 400 other Amazon reviews, so I'm not going to walk you over well-worn paths.My review is for people who saw the movie first and may think it unnecessary to pick up the book. Don't deprive yourself. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the book. I liken this experience to watching the Oscar-winning filmThe Godfatherand then following that up by reading Mario Puzo's novelThe Godfather.As you might have already read or heard, the movie follows the book closely. Naturally, the book provides much more detail about Anton Chigurh, the psychopathic killer at the heart of the story. It is these additional details, these brief scenes that help flesh out Chigurh more as a man than as pure, unrelenting evil.

We purchased two of these wagons for $19.99 each and have owned them for more than a year now. The wagons are holding up very well under the heavy use of a 5-year old and a 4-year old. Most of the activity is in our back yard. Our children even use the wagons to help us clear apples and pears from beneath the trees.Positives:1. At $19.99, these are a great value.2. The wagons are durable.3. The wheels are sturdy enough to pull across grass or pavement.The only negative is minor. Assembly is easier with two people.

We bought this book along withThe Berenstain Bears and the Bad DreamandThe Berenstain Bears Count Their Blessings. I wrote Amazon reviews for those books as well and recommend them.I don't recommend "The Berenstain Bears and the Blame Game."This book starts off with brother and sister bear arguing over who was responsible for a broken vase in the living room. Mama Bear is angry and tired of the blame game. Papa Bear intervenes, cleaning up the mess with the help of the children while Mama Bear calms down. His lesson is "there's always enough blame to go around" so work together to fix the problem.The book suddenly shifts to a second accident, a broken picture window, and Mama and Papa Bear reverse roles, concluding again with "there's always enough blame to go around."The book clearly illustrates a resolution (clean it up) but the story misses the opportunity to address the root problem behind the blame game. The book simply isn't as good asThe Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight.Our sons, ages 6 and 4, enjoy the Berenstain Bears books (we own more than 10 now) and find it easy to relate to the young bears in the series. I like to mix these stories into our rotation of bedtime books to reinforce good manners and behaviors.While I still recommend the Berenstain books listed below, we're running into a new problem: as each book is exclusive, the characters don't evolve. My sons are asking why brother and sister bear didn't learn from the last book. The good news is that my sons remember the lessons; the bad news is that the Berenstain bears don't.We own and recommend:The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Help Around the HouseThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their Manners

Don't miss this great performance by John Cusack because you've heard this is an anti-war film. It isn't.I had expected a storyline along the same lines ofIn the Valley of Elah. This isn't the case. This movie is about a husband's grief and loss. The relationship between Cusack's character and his two daughters is painful and riveting.Fans of John Cusack will appreciate his subtle work here. I also recommend his other recent drama,Martian Child.And Clint Eastwood fans should take note that he composed the musical score and title song for "Grace is Gone."Be ready to dry your eyes.

If you receive this book as a gift see if you can trade it in for a better Seuss book. Don't add it to your bedtime reading rotation if you've already stocked some of the more popular Dr. Seuss titles, such as:The Cat in the HatGreen Eggs and HamHorton Hears a WhoThis book is mind-numbingly repetitive and not in a lyrical, pleasing way likeHop on PoporFox in Socks. Add the fact that this concept is much harder to grasp than what you'll find in most Dr. Seuss books. Job satisfaction isn't a problem for young sons.Overall, these issues don't make this book as horrible as a movie tie-in but I can't recommend this book when it fails to measure up to Dr. Seuss classics.

We added this set of double nine dominoes to our family game collection. Our sons -- ages 5 and 4 -- love to play with these dominoes.I like this set because:*It is affordable*It is durable*It is easy to grasp for little handsSometimes we play a game and then mix it up with a dominoes stacking session. Once kids get the hang of placing a row of dominoes and We also use the dominoes to teach simple addition and subtraction to our sons.Don't buy the TV/movie character sets of dominoes, which are only good for matching games. This set will help teach math skills and kids love the colors.

My two sons, ages 6 and 4, really liked the Space Chimps trailer and asked to watch it once it came out on DVD.We lasted 15 minutes before I turned it off. My sons weren't laughing.Much of the film's humor is based on cultural references and puns that rocket over the heads of the primary audience. A six-year old would need to have watchedThe Right Stuff,2001 - A Space Odysseyand have a basic knowledge of space exploration in the 1950s and 1960s to understand most of the jokes.If that wasn't bad enough, the main character, Ham III, is crude, annoying and a bad role model for kids. I was irritated to explain to my sons that Ham calling another chimp a "dork" is neither funny nor appropriate to repeat.I don't recommend this film to parents of young children, especially as there are three animated films this year alone -Wall-E,Kung Fu PandaandHorton Hears a Who- that all offer superior animation and storylines.If your child is crazy about chimps, I suggestCurious Georgeinstead. It wasn't a great movie but at least you won't have to worry about George asking someone "Is that a banana in your pocket?"

First, I want to state up front that Barbara McClintock's charming illustrations and Jim Aylesworth's retelling are excellent for bedtime reading. The book is very appropriate for young children and storytelling groups.However, my sons didn't react with much enthusiasm. I jokingly blame Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith for that.Scieszka is the author and Smith the illustrator ofThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. After numerous bedtime readings of that crazy compendium, I decided it was time to introduce the classic story that spawned The Stinky Cheese Man.Well, the original fell a little flat. Fortunately, we're only weeks away from Christmas, so the book did renew my sons' interest in baking their own gingerbread men.However, my recommendation is that you read the original to your children first and then follow it up with the parody, especially if you have young boys. I've found that my sons will giggle at just about anything that is "stinky."In summary, this is an attractive take on a classic tale but the story lacks the silliness to compete with other bedtime books.

Despereaux, a tiny mouse with an appetite for books and music, aspires to greater things. His passion and cultured nature subsequently leads to his banishment from Mouseworld for being more like a man than a mouse. When the princess is kidnapped, Despereaux takes action, proving what you look like doesn't equal what you are.Our introduction to author Kate DiCamillo came by way of her Christmas picture book,Great Joy, which I also highly recommend and gave a 5-star review here on Amazon.Two weeks later, my sons caught the trailer for The Tale of Despereaux, which opens in theaters on December 19. Impressed by the trailer, too, I wanted my sons to first experience the book that was awarded the prestigious 2004 Newbery Medal.My sons, ages 6 and 4, are a bit younger than the target audience (8-to-12-year olds) for The Tale of Despereaux but I'm happy to report the bedtime book was received with great enthusiasm. I read 2-3 chapters each night (each chapter is 2-4 pages long) and start by summarizing the previous night's events. That really helped my 4-year old follow the many characters and storylines.My sons' book collection consists of early readers and picture books authored by Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle, Stan & Jan Berenstain and Maurice Sendak among others. I usually read 2-3 books a night, rotating between classics and seasonal stories. Check out my list of bedtime books here on Amazon.The Tale of Despereaux is only the second book of more than 200 pages read to our sons at bedtime. The first book,Dragon Riderby Cornelia Funke, took nearly two months to complete and was a bit of a chore for them to comprehend despite the allure of dragons. That book now waits on the bookshelf for the boys to grow a little older.In summary, I recommend The Tale of Despereaux for young readers (8-to-12-year olds) but parents of younger children can share and appreciate this fairy tale at bedtime as well.

This book is eligible for Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion, so you are not risking a lot of money should you buy this book.It isn't one of our favorites from Eric Carle. The story is supposed to address anger issues -- and it does -- by hitting you over the head as the ladybug flies from page to page trying to pick a fight with larger and larger animals.The problem isn't the message it is the entertainment value. This book simply didn't engage our sons' interest. I suppose it is difficult enough to relate to a bug, much less an angry bug.For our bedtime reading collection, we prefer these Carle books instead:The Very Hungry CaterpillarThe Mixed-Up ChameleonBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?

Based on an idiom and written in verse, this story is an unusual picture book - a hidden treasure - that could get lost among the pirates, dinosaurs and other more common characters found in the children's book section.Bill is an endearing character of contrasts: with top hat and cane, he strikes an elegant figure despite his large figure. And yet, you know, there's trouble ahead when Bill enters the china shop.The real treat here is Tim Raglin's pictures. The cover illustration is representative of the beautiful work contained within. Sometimes, children's picture books try too hard, slipping beyond "colorful" and falling down to a "garish" description instead. Raglin's illustrations bring Bill to life, so much so that on repeated readings my sons were able to cover up the verse and tell the story themselves.Our sons love picture books at bedtime but it isn't easy to find one that appeals to both a 6-year old and a 4-year old. We published an Amazon list titled "Young boys' bedtime books" to share our best discoveries with other parents.In summary, this story makes a nice addition to your children's picture book collection. The rhyming verse is easy to read and follow, however it is Raglin's depiction of Bill that makes this book memorable.

I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.I also recommendKettle Chips Honey DijonandKettle Chips Spicy Thai.Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

I reviewed theSuperman Inflato Suit, a fantastic costume for little boys who love to role play as a superhero. Add this along with the Heat Vision Set and your little Superman is ready to go!This bendable steel bar is soft enough not to hurt anyone but heavy enough to look real, especially to a young boy. To activate the crushing sound, you just place a thumb over a sensor as you bend the bar. The sound effect is realistic.One last note, I don't recommend the Punch N' Crush Gloves because the boys have to punch the air to activate the sound. The steel bar is better and eliminates the possibility of them accidentally punching something or someone.

Our family has played No Stress Chess for several months now. Our 5-year old and 4-year-old dove right in initially and we played this game night after night for the first couple of weeks. We still pull the game out now about 1-2 times per week, but we don't use the cards.The reason I gave this only 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cards don't provide more information to transition beginners from the basic moves. The game should've included more tips to extend the usefulness of the playing cards.Still, at $14, this is a great investment in family fun. The flip side of the board can continued to be used as a standard chess board.

I've had the angled measuring cup for about a year now. I bought it after watching Alton Brown's "Good Eats" TV show on the Food Network.The cup works well, but it takes a bit of getting used to at first. I don't do a whole lot of measuring, so the I don't pull this out that often. The cup is lighter than I expected and doesn't have that same heft you find in Pyrex. That's a minor complaint, the cup is durable and a great value for the price available on Amazon.March 2009 update: This cup is still holding up well and has replaced every other measuring cup I used to store in my kitchen. I recommend this measuring cup and would raise my four-star rating to a five-star rating if I could.

I try to hold off on my reviews for kitchen products because I really want to make sure the durability is there. Back in February 2007, when I bought this can opener, I was very skeptical of the product's claims to room lids and leave behind smooth edges.Now, 18 months later, I can give this can opener a 5-star review.Here's my quick thoughts:1. The can opener requires some practice to get the hang of it.2. You'll likely spill a little of the can's contents at first.3. It is easy to hold and even easier to clean.4. It is a little bulky, so it doesn't fit in our silverware drawer.5. The can opener works as good today as the first day it arrived.

I've reviewed several of the Berenstain Bears books available at Amazon. This one is my least favorite because it is stuck in the mid-1980s. Mother Bear supposes the increased TV viewing is a result of the family switching from a black-and-white TV to a color set or, perhaps, because Papa Bear installed a new antenna atop the tree house.Seriously, in a world of satellite TV, digital video recorders and on-demand movies, do you think upgrading to color television is the issue?The rest of the book, which focuses on outdoor activities and the value of a family dinner time, is still valuable, but could use an update as well.Skip this book and pick up "The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Commercials" instead.

Please don't pass over this book for the movie. That said, I like the Chuck Jones-directed, 1966 television production but that doesn't stop me from bringing this book out from November through December for a regular rotation in our bedtime reading.Now, I haven't perfected a Boris Karloff-style narration but I do work up a good, grinchy voice for the bedtime readings. If I begin to slip into my natural voice, my sons will remind me, "Papa, use your Grinchy voice."I think you have to act as well as read this book to get the most out of the story (read my review of "The Monster at the End of the Book" for tips on imitating Grover).While my children prefer the animated movie to the Jim Carrey film version, I do borrow from Jim, too. I add a lot of scrunched eyebrows and sneers while I read the Grinch's part. I act out his faithful dog, Max, with a trembling lip and wide-eyes, especially during the sled ride down to Whoville.My sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old. Their bookshelf holds about 80-100 books and at least 10 of those are from Dr. Suess. I recommend this book for your bedtime reading.

We purchased a set of these coffee cups in February 2007. All of the cups are still in great shape. We purchased the cups because we liked the color and size, but one of the other reviews said the cups were not well made. That's not our experience. Microwave, dishwasher, kids -- these cups have withstood them all.November 2008 UPDATE: The coffee cups are still in great shape. Several people have commented that the cups are large but easy to handle. We continue to run these cups through the dishwasher and they are holding up great!

I'm not writing this review from an adult's perspective. My two sons -- ages 6 and 4 -- really looked forward to Wall-E. This is their review.We downloaded each new movie trailer on my computer and watched them multiple times. (If you haven't seen "Vacuum Vignette" you should go online and watch it.) The anticpation was greater than any other movie released in the summer of 2008.Both of my sons gave this movie their "GG" rating -- Good! Good! They've never offered anything higher than "GGG" so I translated their rating into a four-star review here.The first 25 minutes of this movie worried me because there's no dialogue, but Pixar had my kids captivated. In summary, this is a touching family comedy and love story that never forgets to entertain its main audience -- kids.Good news: The DVD includes two animated shorts: "Presto Amazing" from the original theatrical release and the all-new "Burn-E."I also recommend these Pixar films:Toy Story (1995)Toy Story 2 (1999)Monsters, Inc. (2001)Finding Nemo (2003)The Incredibles (2004)Cars (2006)Ratatouille (2007)

My wife says she likes this vacuum because it has good suction and it has variable levels of suction.She also likes the washable HEPA filter, which means she saves some money by not having to buy replacements.The power brush for the carpet cleans better than a normal vacuum, she said.The retractable power cord is another plus. Fortunately, we live in a single-level home, so the vacuum weight isn't an issue. It can be pulled around the house with ease. However, if your house is multi-level, you should be aware the base (including canister) is heavy.

I don't want to sound grumpy about this USB hub. I've had my hub for more than a year now and it has worked with all of the flash drives I've plugged into it. The four ports on the back of the hub are too close for my liking.I can't speak to the iPod shuffle (don't have one) but my digital camera plugs in nicely. For personal use, though, I'd like a little more design and personality to go along with the functionality.

I like to bring this bedtime book out after a rough day between our 5-year old and 4-year old boys. Like the Berenstain Bears books, the story allows us to discuss the bears' behavior first and follow that up with a discussion about the boys' behavior.For young readers, the Berenstain Bears offer an easy-to-understand storyline to which children can relate.This is one of the better, more accessible books in the Berenstain Bears collection. We also own and recommend:The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Help Around the HouseThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears Learn About StrangersThe Berenstain Bears and the Bad DreamYou can pick up these books at a good price through Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion. I like the soft covers, which can be rolled up as stocking stuffers.

The glow darts don't fly as far nor do they fly as accurately as the micro darts that were included with the Nerf gun.Do these darts glow in the dark? Yes. But for the price - almost a dollar each - the negatives outweigh the gimmick. I recommend theHasbro Nerf Mega Micro Dart Packif you like to use suction cup tips for target practice. For tag players, try theHasbro Nerf Dart Tag Refill Pack: 30 Tagger Micro Dartsinstead.

83 minutes in four episodes of the Incredible Hulk's animated series is just not enough value for your dollar. Buy this only if your child absolutely loves the Hulk and is too young to watch the PG-13 rated live action film, The Incredible Hulk, starring Edward Norton. Check my review of that DVD (good movie but absolutely not for little kids).I game a similar review to the first animated DVD from The Spectacular Spider-Man, the new series from the WB. You should get more for your money than 3-4 episodes. In the case of Spider-Man, it looks promising that the entire first series will be released. So far, the Hulk hasn't had the same luck.Also, please avoid the new Avengers animated DVDs. I made the mistake of picking these up without checking the ratings -- they feature the Hulk, but the stories and the language are not for young children.If you're looking for better choices for your little superhero fan, check out my Amazon listmania list, "Batman / Dark Knight entertainment for little boys" and have fun!

TheSuperman Inflato Suitis a great role playing toy for little boys. Check out my review, where I recommend buying the Heat Vision Set and the Superman Bendable Steel Bar with Sound to complete the costume.These are really fun to use at night or in a darkened room. You'll need to warn your kids not to aim them directly into someone else's eyes though.My sons say the Heat Vision Set doesn't hurt to wear. It is popular with them and durable, too. I'm happy.One last note, I don't recommend the Punch N' Crush Gloves because the boys have to punch the air to activate the sound. The steel bar is better and eliminates the possibility of them accidentally punching something or someone.

Through the work week, breakfast is perfunctory with oatmeal just another option among cereal bars and yogurt. We've stocked various brands of instant oatmeal but Quaker Oatmeal Express best balances our desires for tasty and healthy. Our sons - ages 6 and 4 - enjoy the different flavors. My wife likes the individual cups, which make clean-up a breeze.Quaker Oatmeal Express is office-friendly, too. You can prepare the oatmeal with hot water or a microwave. Either way, you've got a no-mess breakfast in less than two minutes. Again, the individual cups are great for a portable option much healthier than anything you'll find on a fast food drive-thru menu.We've purchased three Quaker Oatmeal Express flavors,Cinnamon Roll,Golden Brown SugarandBaked Apple. All three are not overly sweet. My youngest son doesn't care for cinnamon, so he eats Baked Apple or Golden Brown Sugar. The Baked Apple flavor has a slight fiber edge (1 g) over the other flavors.In summary, skip the sausage egg biscuit and pick up this healthier breakfast option instead. (Studies have found that oatmeal is more filling than dry cereal with the same calories and fiber content.) Quaker Oatmeal Express is healthy, portable and makes clean-up easy.One caveat: if time is not a consideration, the best oatmeal you can buy on Amazon isMcCANN'S Steel Cut Oatmeal. We purchase it through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. This is our Sunday-morning-family-breakfast oatmeal. We add frozen berries, or a tablespoon of brown sugar and an ounce of Drambuie to the cooking pot. The texture and nutty flavor of McCann's oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced.

While the concept was interesting and the problem real (Our two boys bounce every chance they get!), the story quickly devolves into jumbled rhymes and no clear storyline. The book doesn't rise to Dr. Suess quality. The rhymes are leaden ("Hattie, Battie, Fattie...") and fall faster than the boy tumbles though his apartment floors.On a positive note, it was nice to see a kids book that uses an apartment building as its main setting. The classics are usually set in a house or, more specifically, a farm house. We live in the suburbs, so it was great to illustrate how children live in apartments. BTW:Santa's Book of Namesillustrates how Santa delivers to children living in apartments.In summary, Tedd Arnold's story doesn't stand up to the Dr. Suess classics, which offer better storylines and rhymes. Rating: Three stars.

Chicago's greatest achievement and horror of the 19th Century written in meticulous and rich detail create a non-fiction book that reads like a novel.I start with an admission: initially, the titular Devil fascinated me more than the White City. America's first urban serial killer H.H. Hughes is quite a draw. I noted that Erik Larson won the 2004 Edgar Award Winner for Best Fact Crime and several reviews compared his writing to Truman Capote's groundbreaking work,In Cold Blood. I doubted either Frederick Law Olmsted, the leading landscape architect, or Daniel Burnham, the chief architect of the Chicago World's Fair, could hold my attention like the exploits of Hughes.Halfway through Part One, the chapter "Becomingness" moved the fulcrum, shifting my interest from the serial killer to the engineers responsible for the World's Fair. In this chapter, Olmsted's vision and passion for landscape architecture becomes contagious. At the request of the exposition directors, Olmsted delivers a second report, calling for a unity of design, "the becomingness of everything that may be seen as a modestly contributive part of a grand whole." I assure you will never look at another public park the same way -- Olmsted designed New York City's Central Park, an achievement unimaginable today.Thus, from this point forward, Burnham and Olmsted secured the book's lead (and my interest). I admired their dreams and rooted for their success.That is not to say the other half of the book is uninteresting. Hardly. Larson transports readers into Hughes' cold, methodical hotel, an unimaginable horror where dozens, or maybe hundreds, of young women were murdered. However, my interest in Hughes waned as I could summon no empathy for a psychopath, or sociopath or whatever euphemism you wish to use (although Larson wisely choose "The Devil").It seems strange that the events surrounding the 1893 World's Fair largely escapes most U.S. history textbooks. History aficionados will enjoy the "occasional side journey" Larson takes as he connects famous people and events to Chicago's greatest achievement.The Devil in the White Cityis a rare treasure, a book that is not what I expected but, rather, something better, a story that stayed with me long after I reached the last page.Rating: Five stars. (My only complaint is there are not more illustrations within the book, on a website supported by the book's publisher, or a website listing in the index.)

I bought this book along with two "Frog Zoo Light Carabiner with Sound" (available here on Amazon) for my 5-year old and 4-year old boys.The lights are great for bedtime reading. You pull back the frog's head and they croak and shine a light from their mouth.The book follows a pattern where the frog sneaks up on insects around the pond and "Ssshhh" (that's when my kids have to turn off their frogs). When the frog slurps up the insect, both boys pull back their frogs head and the room fills with croaking.I read this book about once a week and the ritual is always the same. I pull this book down from the highest shelf in their closet (any lower and they'd play with this book every day). I settle down between them and hand out the pocket frogs. Then, each boy pulls on the long, sticky frog tongue hangs from the frog's mouth on the book cover. They pull the tongue out until I say, "OK, far enough" and they let it go with a resounding snap as the paper fly shoots back onto the cover.The book has survived nearly six months of tongue pulling, so I give it a high grade for durability. I bought the large book, although I've read there's a smaller version available. I recommend the larger book so that your children can play with the frog's tongue and they can enjoy the larger illustrations.

Length:: 1:30 MinsThe name belies an intoxicating medium-roast blend that fuses flavors from Central America, Indonesia and East Africa. The Nantucket Blend is deliciously complex - a m&eacute;lange of four coffees from three continents - opening with the aroma of berries, spice and wine and soft floral undertones and finishing smoky and sweet with a touch of French Roast.According to the Green Mountain Coffee website, the blend's origin dates back more than 20 years ago, "created at the request of a loyal customer who lived on Nantucket Island. The blend proved a winner, and the name stuck."I drink Nantucket Blend black, using Keurig's small mug (7.25 oz) setting. My wife, who will often add creamer to darker roasts, also enjoys this blend black.In summary, this medium-roast blend is a new favorite in our house. We first purchased Nantucket Blend during an Amazon sale for about 55 cents per Keurig cup. Regular price is about 66 cents, 15 cents higher per cup than other brands. Is it worth the additional price? Yes, but keep an eye out for sales.Added bonuses:Nantucket Blend is certified kosher by the Orthodox Union.Green Mountain Coffee is Fair Trade Certified.Green Mountain Coffee is organic.Rating: Five stars.BTW: Here's my recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:5 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend5 stars:Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast5 stars:Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle4 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Lake & Lodge Blend4 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry4 stars:Tully's Coffee Kona Blend4 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic3 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend3 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread

Melissa and Doug floor puzzles are very popular in our household. This particular puzzle, on the heels of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" trilogy, is one of their favorites.We have two children, both younger than 6-years old, and highly recommend this puzzle for kids of the same age. The pieces are easy for young children to handle and the puzzle is very durable after repeated uses.

The Dark Knight Rises releases in July 2012. Batman fans wanting their Bane fix can fill the void with this energetic BBC radio performance.For a program recorded nearly two decades ago, the performance holds up well, especially since later Batman films -Batman BeginsandThe Dark Knight-- and animated releases such asBatman: Under the Red Hoodturned up the darkness dial. Dirk Maggs, who adapted, produced and directed the full-cast performance, delivers a Batman story much closer to Christopher Nolan's vision than Joel Schumacher's work.According to its Wikipedia entry, the performance's fast pacing is because this show "...was not commissioned of its own, but rather to be three minute episodes on the Mark Goodier Show. This meant it was written with a sense of immediacy; having to make an instant effect and each three minute segment contains a major plot development or sound effect stunt and end on a cliffhanger."I highly recommend listening to this performance (provided in continuous format only)with earphones instead of a speaker system. I usedLogitech's Ultimate Ears 200 Noise-Isolating Earphones. The attached liner notes explain that additional sound effects and a new remaster has improved the show's original sound.Aside from Michael Gough, who starred as Alfred Pennyworth in all four movies of the Burton/Schumacher Batman franchise, the audio cast is unfamiliar to American audiences. Bob Sessions (Batman), Kerry Shale (The Joker) and Lorelei King (Martha Wayne) return from the former recording,Batman: The Lazarus Syndrome: A BBC Full-Cast Radio Drama.Here's the cast list for Batman Knightfall:* Bob Sessions as Batman* Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth* Daniel Marinker as Robin* Peter Marinker as Bane, Jack Drake* Kerry Shale as Jean Paul Valley, The Joker, The Cavalier, Thomas Wayne* William Roberts as Commissioner James Gordon, Amygdala, Carlton LeHa, Tough Tony* Lorelei King as Renee Montoya, Leslie Thompkins, Lady Shiva, Young Bruce, Martha Wayne, Sarah Essen* Eric Meyers as Harvey Bullock, Colonel Vega, Batcave Computer, Joe Chill, Bird, Jeremiah Arkham, Firefly, Nomoz* Michael Roberts as The Ventriloquist, Film Freak, Simpson Flanders, Benedict Asp, Hood* Alibe Parsons as Shondra Kinsolving* James Goode as Nightwing, The Scarecrow* Stuart Milligan as Riddler, Maxie Zeus* Chris Emmett as Mad Hatter* Vincent Marzello as Armand Krol, Abattoir, Mr. ZsaszKevin Conroy and Mark Hamill set the standard as Batman and Joker in theBatman: The Animated Series. That said, Bob Sessions (Batman), Peter Marinker (Bane), and Daniel Marinker (Robin) capture their characters' spirit. Kerry Shale deserves special credit for double coverage, providing quality voicework for Jean Paul Valley/Azrael and The Joker. Ron Perlman, Clancy Brown, Michael Dorn and Danny Trejo all have taken a turn at voicing Bane, but Peter Marinker holds his own in this radio adaption.In summary, fans unaccustomed to radio dramas might pass this performance by but that would be a mistake. This show is also a great way to introduce younger Batman fans to this historic storyline as it leaves out vulgarity and graphic violence. For the price, I wish the CD compilation included a mini-comic book, more behind the scenes features and the original, three-minute format. Those are my only complaints.Rating: Four stars.BTW: There are two different listings and multiple sellers for this CD set (new and used). You can buy this oneBatman Knightfallor this oneBatman Knightfall.

I bought this video for my sons because these songs had a great effect on my schooling. I was hooked from "Conjunction Junction" and never stopped being a fan.We like to play this DVD in the mornings, selecting the "spicy" version, which plays the songs in random order. Our children watch it as they have breakfast.This makes me happy for two reasons:1. I know the catchy songs will help them learn, just as they did for me;2. and, because my kids can enjoy this DD instead of being bombarded by TV commercials.We actually rented this DVD from Netflix first to see if our kids were going to like it. We also have rented the first seasons of Sesame Street, The Electric Company, The Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock. We don't own a lot of DVDs but I'm glad we added Schoolhouse Rock to our collection.

We purchased this along with the 14"Interactive Spider-ManandInteractive Green Goblinfigures (check out my Amazon reviews).The whole lot was a complete disaster. We have a 5-year old and a 4-year old and they want to 'play' with action figures, not just sit and watch the figure repeat a couple phrases.If you have an older child who wants these for room decorations, then by all means, buy it. If your child wants to play with the toys, look at the Hasbro line of action figures from the new WB cartoon series, "The Spectacular Spider-Man."UPDATE: This toy finally broke. The one-star rating is accurate.

Michael Jackson owned 1983. From his moonwalking performance during "Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever" broadcast on March 25 to the music video release of "Thriller" on December 2, his music filled every radio, TV and dance club.I purchased the MP3 album for my sons (ages 9 and 7). They are too young to have seen Jackson perform at his best but time does not prevent them from appreciating his music, especially the best-selling album of all time. I downloaded the album to my Amazon cloud drive and, then, loaded their MP3 players. Within a couple hours they were in socks, attempting to moonwalk across our wood floors.My personal favorites from this album are "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" and "The Girl Is Mine" (with Paul McCartney). So far, my sons' favorites are "Thriller" and "Beat It", the former because of its novelty (Vincent Price's haunting rap) and the latter for its infectious rhythm.I'm having a lot of fun experiencing the magic again through my children.My MP3 purchase was $3.99 for the entire album, an album savings of $7.62 compared to buying all songs individually. That's a great price if you can take advantage of it. I also recommend signing up for Amazon's Cloud Drive - a great way to buy and store your music.Rating: Five stars.BTW: I also purchasedNumber Ones, an 18-song collection of Michael Jackson's top hits. I added " The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man In The Mirror", and "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" to my sons' playlist.

We use a large coffee press in the morning, which provides four cups of coffee. We share the first two and the rest goes into this Thermos.At lunchtime, I have hot coffee. Not cold, not warm, not tepid. HOT coffee! I used to buy my afternoon coffee but no more.The Nissan thermos is compact and light enough I can take it to work whether I'm driving or riding my bike.We were so pleased with this thermos we bought a second one a month later so that we can carry soup or another beverage on weekend trips.We paid $23 for the first thermos and received the second one 'free' as part of Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion.

The Super Bowl is less than two weeks away. If you're hosting a party or planning to take a plate of appetizers over to a friend's house pick up an order of Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce.This versatile sauce can be paired with many popular appetizers. The Fischer & Wieser web site lists recipes for sesame wings, cheese tarts, won tons, little smokies and chicken dippers among others. Of course, don't forget that the easiest recipe is to pour this sauce over softened cream cheese and serve with crackers.The Fischer & Wieser web site says it best: "the sweetness of the fresh raspberries is the perfect contrast to the spicy smoke of the chipotle pepper. This award winning sauce is delicious with any meat, fish or fowl."Amazon packages six 20-ounce bottles in one shipment. Don't let the order size scare you off. One bottle provides enough sauce to compliment 2-3 appetizers but your guests are going to want a bottle of their own. In fact, this sauce makes an excellent gift (each bottle comes a small booklet of recipes, including pecan-crusted trout and pork tenderloin).Of course, you'll want to keep some on hand, too. Whip equal parts of this sauce with balsamic vinegar and you've got a spicy, sweet salad dressing that accompanies all salad types - mixed greens, radicchio, cabbage and fruit.In summary, yes it's that good. Rating: Five stars.

Maybe you've watched the U.S. version on NBC and you're wondering if the original TV series is funny, too.The BBC series is darker, more cringe-inducing and, ultimately, far better than the U.S. series. Two seasons long with a special that serves as the season finale, The Office doesn't have a weak episode. The second season steps up the darker comedy.The U.S. series is entering its sixth season and "jumped the shark" in season three. And that's the beauty of the original series -- the show ends before it becomes fat, silly and stupid.

Just like inUltimate Spider-Manyou are playing in Mark Bagley's comic book world, a 3D environment that feels as though you're jumping in and out of the pages and panels of a comic book.You play half the game as Spider-Man and the other half as the Green Goblin. You fight gang members and save New Yorkers caught in the action. The fighting gets monotonous though and older kids are going to get tired soon. Younger players will mind it as much but don't expect them to reach for this game so quickly a month after you buy it.As a parent, the minigames were frustrating. The one involving the locks requires you to lift an increasing number of tumblers into place. Each tumbler shakes and falls if left in place too long. My kids often would ask me to help them get past these minigames.The side-scrolling levels are easy to follow but they look a lot better than you'd expect due to the 3D and comic book style. Younger kids will appreciate the music and sound effects that combine to really take you into Spider-Man's universe.The game is shorter than other adventure titles on the Nintendo DS but rates about average for the beat-'em-up superhero games available.

Some days I forget I'm not 13 years old anymore. Flatulence isn't as funny as it used to be; the same goes for slapstick and B-rated movies like Sharktopus.Reviewer Andrew Wright summed it up by writing, "If, in the final accounting, the movie is only half as enjoyable to watch as the title is to say, that's still an awful lot of fun." I suppose that would be true if I had watched the movie with a bunch of guys and a case of beer. Unfortunately, I watched this schlock-fest from Roger Corman with my wife in the room. As the title credits rolled, she questioned my taste; five minutes later, she questioned my sanity; and, finally, she began to question our marriage.I recommend Sharktopus for teenage boys and dorm room double features. The silly acting and sillier special effects will play to cheers and hoots of laughter. Eric Roberts performance alone could inspire a half dozen drinking games.Married men older than 40, however, would do better to pass this up and ask their wife to select another romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts or Reese Witherspoon. Then, sit back on the couch and imagine Sharktopus attacking Julia.Rating: Three stars.

Less fun than Play-Doh and harder to clean. There's not a single positive thing to say about this toy other than it is quickly running out of stock. Don't get sucked in by the savings offers, this toy is a sticky, slimy mess that adheres to what you don't want and stains and sticks to stuff you'll spend hours trying to clean.Trust me, stay away from Krazy Kryptonite.

We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old. They love to watch Mr. Bean episodes. His silliness ellicts giggles from our kids like I've never heard while they watch Saturday morning cartoons. When Mr. Bean gets a turkey stuck on his head my kids roll on the floor laughing.I know several episodes in this collection are edited and several fans have already noted that in their reviews. As much as I wish the edits hadn't been made this set is still a great buy if you are looking for family-friendly comedy to share your young children.My sons loved this DVD set so much we also purchased Mr. Bean, The Animated Series, which I also recommend (see my Amazon reviews) here:Mr. Bean The Animated Series, Vols. 1 & 2 (It's Not Easy Being Bean / Bean There Done That)Mr. Bean - The Animated Series, Vols. 3 & 4 (Whatever Will Bean, Will Bean / It's All Bean to Me)Mr. Bean The Animated Series, Vols. 5 & 6 (Grin and Bean It / The Ends Justify the Beans)

MY sons, ages 6 and 4, haven't stopped practicing their Kung Fu moves in our living room, cutting the air with their hands and feet. More importantly, the story's message -- believing in yourself and reaching for your dreams -- is not lost on them.Po, the titular panda, is often silly but he's never mean-spirited in his pursuit of his destiny. My sons cheered him on as he and the Furious Five took on kung fu warrior Tai Lung.Most of the laughs occur during Po's training, as he befuddles master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman gets in some great lines here) and offends the Furious Five -- Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper, only to later gain their respect.This is a fun movie for young kids. Parents can relax knowing it is age-appropriate entertainment that will be enjoyed for repeat viewings.

Unlike many of the other picture books from Random House, this book is illustrated with pictures from the TV show. My sons really lit up when they recognized the stories on TV from our bedtime reading.There are four stories:Double TroubleA Cow on the LineOld IronPercy Takes the PlungeWe have several other Thomas books that were regulars in our bedtime reading collection. I say "were" because my sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old and both are a little too old for these picture books. Aim to read these with your 2-3-year olds.

I'm a fan of the Coen Brothers, so their attachment to this book is what drew me to the movie,No Country for Old Menfirst. I hadn't read Cormac McCarthy's other books, so this story was a nice introduction to his fiction and I look forward to delving into his other works.The book is a modern-day western. My review follows more than 400 other Amazon reviews, so I'm not going to walk you over well-worn paths.My review is for people who saw the movie first and may think it unnecessary to pick up the book. Don't deprive yourself. If you enjoyed the movie, you will enjoy the book. I liken this experience to watching the Oscar-winning filmThe Godfatherand then following that up by reading Mario Puzo's novel,The Godfather.As you might have already read or heard, the movie follows the book closely. Naturally, the book provides much more detail about Anton Chigurh, the psychopathic killer at the heart of the story. It is these additional details, these brief scenes that help flesh out Chigurh more as a man than as pure, unrelenting evil.BTW: Here's my five-star review of the movie:I first wrote my Amazon review of the book because, after watching this movie, I was interested to see for myself how much of the screenplay actually came word-for-word from the book.Although many parts of the book appear in the movie, don't cheat yourself by missing out on the story in both media.I mentioned,The Godfather, because I made a point of reading the Mario Puzo book after watching that movie. As always happens, the movie had to trim away scenes and characters but the heart of the story remained intact.The Coen brothers had a lot less cutting to do from the source material in making No Country for Old Men. Regardless, the movie and the book both stand up well to repeated viewings and readings.Here are some of the other guy films --The Godfather Part II,Die Hard,GoodFellas,The Dark Knight,Lonesome DoveandThe Shawshank Redemptionto name a few -- that your husband or boyfriend will watch again and again over his lifetime.

Moose are great cooks who do the laundry, the dishes and sweep the floors. They do these chores and much, much more at the invitation of Molly, a young girl who announces, "Some children like cats. Some children like dogs. I like moose." Molly goes out in search of moose only to find they are on holiday in her hometown.These moose - Monty, Munroe and Milligan - are the two-legged variety, a comedic trio sauntering around on hoofs that look and perform like tap shoes. Their antlers are as large as they are multi-functional (you may never look at spaghetti the same way again). My sons, ages 6 and 4, giggled a lot as we read this bedtime story. The silliness was so addictive that my sons imagined other activities the moose could complete with their antlers during subsequent readings.This is a fun, imaginative book perfect for bedtime reading; we rate it five stars.

I slip this book into the bedtime rotation a couple times per month. Of all the Berenstain Bears books, this one elicits the most uncomfortable looks from my two, young boys.The book touches on the value of the truth as well as the problems that result from being a tattler. I've found the book to be a great tool for instilling values in our children. The book acts as a springboard to discuss their behavior and any outstanding issues they want to talk about.The best of the Berenstain Bears books can help a parent reemphasize good values and good manners. I recommend this book for your kids' collection.Here's some other Berenstain Bears books I recommend:The Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TVThe Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers

My wife picked this up for me after I complained about my bar soap turning to mush. I don't have a lot of experience using shower scrubs, so my expectations were low.I was looking for something handy to take along on business trips and use in the locker rooms. The AXE shower scrub was good on both counts.I use the shower scrub along with theSalux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel(see my Amazon review), so it is difficult for me to know how much additional scrubbing power AXE provides. Anyway, the smell is faintly citrus and not overpowering. I get a good lather, drizzling a bit on the nylon towel. And my wife says I smell good.What more do I need?

I ordered a box of these pens back in 1999. I had just returned to the U.S. after several years working in Japan, where I became a loyal customer of Sanford.I recommend this pen for people with large hands or who find the thin barreled pens uncomfortable to use. The Gel Impact RT is 50% wider than a standard pencil and features a rubber grip that helps with control and comfort. The 1.0mm pen stroke is solid and flows easily (hint: at first use or when loading a refill, make a line of 20 check marks; this helps open up the ink flow behind the ball point).A number of co-workers and friends have borrowed my pens over the years. Sometimes I get them back, often I don't. The pens are so popular and in demand that our office now stocks them and refills.I carry two of these pens (blue and red) in my FranklinCovey compact Sedona Leather planner (check my Amazon review for more information) and a spare refill in the planner's zipper pouch.

The wonderful reception given Syd Hoff's more famous book, Danny and the Dinosaur, led us to purchase this title, too.I notice the difference in quality between the first book and this later effort. However, my young boys don't seem to mind. They dove right back into Danny's world and enjoyed the story.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly 80-100 books and Syd Hoff has three titles in our collection -- Oliver, Danny and the Dinosaur and Happy Birthday, Danny and the Dinosaur.

When my boys were 2- and 3-years old, I'd read this bedtime book to them regularly because the verse and illustrations were soothing. There were nights when a soft rockabye and some gentle verses were a better way to get them to sleep than a Dr. Suess book.If you are just building your bedtime reading collection, I recommend this book along with these other rockabye favorites of ours:* Bedtime: First Words, Rhymes, and Actions (Board book (various authors)* Rock-A-Bye Farm by Diane Johnston Hamm* I Love You: A Rebus Poem by Jean MarzolloYou can check my reviews on all of these books. Enjoy.

Line up the 2008 summer action movies and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor falls into the you-should've-stopped-while-you-were-still-ahead pile of disappointing sequels that includesIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullandThe X-Files: I Want to Believe.OnlyHellboy II: The Golden Armyavoided that same trap, offering a bigger, funnier and more exciting installment that, in fairness, exceeded drastically lower expectations than those facing either Indiana Jones or Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser).The third film adds new faces. Maria Bello takes over the role of Evelyn from Rachel Weisz. Outstanding inThe CoolerandA History of Violence, Bello is asked to play a light beer version of the rugged female action star, an ancestor to Sigourney Weaver'sRipleyor Linda Hamilton'sSarah Connor.Bello and Fraser are joined by their son, Alex (Luke Ford). Ford is miscast, too close in age to Fraser and their relationship is clich&eacute; (Indiana Jones, for example, used that particular plot device twice). Additionally, Alex and Lin (Isabella Leong) share little chemistry.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor marks an anniversary of sorts for Jet Li, who played the bad guy in the sloppy sequel,Lethal Weapon 4, ten years ago. Most moviegoers in 1998 hadn't yet witnessed Jet Li's martial art skills. Riggs and Murtaugh were tired and bloated but Jet Li almost single-handedly made Lethal Weapon 4 worth watching.This time around, not even Jet Li can save the sequel.There are as many reasons as plot holes why this sequel doesn't charm like the original, even allowing for the absent logic on which popcorn movies thrive. Haven't had enough exploding CGI mummies? Well, this is your movie. Besides, the international box office for Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ensures another sequel in a couple years (and don't be surprised if the O'Connell family shows up in South America).

We purchased this pirate gear for our oldest son's Halloween costume in 2007. The accessories were great -- he really liked the compass, cutlass and pirate rings.He wore the costume a couple more times after Halloween just for fun. He still has the compass, which we use with our Mattel Matchbox 360 Pop-Up Pirate Island (see my Amazon review).Does your child want to be a pirate this Halloween? The Jack Sparrow pirate gear is a great choice -- inexpensive, loaded with accesories and very durable.

The story is a classic, so I won't bother you with my opinion of the details. This book is a favorite during our holiday season bedtime readings because of the wonderful illustrations.I picked up my copy through Amazon's 4 for 3 promotion, but several sellers have this available for less than $5.UPDATE: Two sellers here on Amazon have this book priced at ridiculous levels -- $40 and $140. While I still believe this is one of the better illustrated versions of the classic story I cannot recommend you spend more than $5-$6 for a copy. Check around at used bookstores and your local library first but do not pay these ridiculous prices.

We bought this DVD and "The Berenstain Bears - Fun Family Adventures" to complement the bedtime books in our sons' bookshelf.The title of my review reflects my sons' first viewing of the DVD. We had spent the day playing bocce (check out my review of the Halex Classic Series Bocce Set) at a neighborhood park. It was almost 4 p.m. and our boys were getting tired. Too late for a nap and too early for dinner, I instructed them to get up on the couch while I loaded the DVD.Just like the books, each story has a message. This DVD has six episodes:The Excuse NoteOn the JobThe Giddy GrandmaThe Bad HabitDraw ItThe Female FullbackEach episode is about 10 minutes long - the entire DVD runs 82 minutes. The animation matches the books. The voice acting is solid. Overall, this is a nice addition to your Berenstain Bears collection of books and DVDs.

With the ending never in doubt (check out the subtitle), the story drags on 4-5 pages too long, like a familiar joke burdened with too many details. Author Joe Hayes states in his closing note that he has "given the tale a more literary treatment than I usually do." The result is a story better suited for older readers (ages 7-10) than for a read-aloud bedtime book.As negative as that sounds, I actually like Hayes' book and his effort to fill out this adaptation of "The Faithful Servant." Each character's decisions and the solemn consequences are richly detailed in both the narrative and artist Joseph Daniel Fieldler's earthy, full-page paintings.My sons (ages 8 and 6) would have enjoyed the suspense, not knowing if Juan Verdades would be faithful to his employer, don Ignacio. However, the first words on the inside dust jacket flap are "Juan Verdades is an honest man." Combined with the unnecessary subtitle it was difficult to build suspense. There are a couple twists along the way but I won't spoil these. The rewards for Juan's honesty far exceed expectations.After the first reading to my sons, we discussed the other choices Juan could have made and the likely consequences of those actions. The conversation helped reinforce the book's valuable moral lesson.Rating: Four stars.

Was your only experience with ramen noodles as a cheap lunch, either during college or when you were just starting out?Well, you are in for a treat.I warn you though: once you try a Nong Shim noodle bowl and you will never go back to a Nissin Cup Noodle.Nong Shim offers a fantastic instant noodle bowl; balancing the right amount of seasoning and spice to make it a perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon.Please take a look at the product photo I posted that shows the ChefsBest Award and endorsements. I've recommended this noodle bowl to many people but a few of them, because of the kimchi flavor, have been hesitant to give it a try. I can attest that Nong Shim's noodles are not as pungent as `fresh' kimchi. The noodle bowl has a rich, red broth that is visibly loaded with spices.My first Amazon order included two cases of noodles. Next time, I plan to try Nong Shim Bowl Noodle Soup, Beef & Ginger and Nong Shim Bowl Noodle, Spicy Lobster.

We're always looking for a good bedtime book that entertains our young boys while teaching good hygiene and manners. Their book collection includesSniffles, Sneezes, Hiccups, and CoughsandMicro Monsters: Life Under the Microscope, both of which I highly recommend.The star of Bad Breath is "Hally Tosis," a dog that emits green clouds of halitosis. The family decides to give away the dog after its breath causes grandmother to faint. That same bad breath later knocks out two burglers, which leads the family to decide to keep the dog after all.That's the story. Really, that's it.I was disappointed but my sons enjoyed the story. This was our first Dav Pilkey book, so I didn't know what to expect. Pilkey loves puns and silly illustrations and both of those are here in abundance. What's missing is a resolution to the bad breath, maybe a little brushing or flossing.Food in your mouth rots, helping bacteria grow, which leads to bad breath and can cause gum disease (gingivitis). We have toothbrushes for our dogs as well as bones and other teeth-cleaning treats. I suggest that when you finish the book ask your kids if they know some solutions to bad breath other than clipping clothespins to your nose.In summary, the story is lighthearted and entertaining but closes with a makeshift resoution that misses an opportunity. I'd rate the book four stars if it included an epilogue about good hygiene but, as it stands, the book misses the mark: three stars.

I love Oregon. I love the Pacific Northwest. My back yard, my personal playground and living room. I take pride in recommending good places to visit, stay and eat. To ensure a quality recommendation I talk with many people. I read a lot: newspapers; magazines; blogs; online forums and review sites like Urbanspoon, Yelp, Angie's List and Judy's Book among others.Apparently, Fodor's uses a different approach: dust off the last edition and give it a cursory edit. Tick off tired adjectives like `spacious' hotels and `elegant' dining rooms. Fodor's acts as though no other up-to-date information is available online other than the website of the establishment mentioned and its own (sparse) website and electronic newsletter.Is the Fodor's guide right for you? No, if you own either a smartphone, a laptop or a netbook. Don't waste your time looking for handy smartphone aps to use on your vacation in the Pacific Northwest. You won't find them in Fodor's. (Forget about Quick Response (QR) codes, too.) The editors at Fodor's think Foursquare is a game children play at recess.What you will find is nearly 30 pages of generic travel advice that deftly separates the Jeopardy contestants from those who Jay Leno finds for street interviews. Surprise! The Canadian currency units are the dollar and the cent.Fodor offers two pages of hiking advice that leaves out any mention of a communication device, listing instead 10 essentials from the Washington State Trails Association. Hikers would do well to visit the REI website and read the updated list (or watch the video posted there as well). REI notes "The original Ten Essentials list was assembled in the 1930s by The Mountaineers, a Seattle-based organization for climbers and outdoor adventurers." The updated list debuted in 2003; maybe Fodor's will catch on in its next edition.So, is the Fodor's guide right for you? Yes, if you are the type of traveler who only uses a computer if one is available in the hotel's business kiosk. You can futz around, typing listings from the guide into a search engine and printing directions on an inkjet printer. Enjoy that free pape- filtered ground coffee while younger generations lap you and score the last reservation at whatever restaurant/hotel/event you hoped to enjoy.As much as I want to delve into specifics about the wrong or missing information, I don't want to harm a local business just to illustrate how dated and inaccurate is the information Fodor's sells. For example, in the southern Oregon section where I live, a `Fodor's Choice' (a special designation given to top recommendations) was given to a winery that was the leading producer and tourist destination...in 2005. In the meantime, one or two other nearby wineries raised the bar and surpassed `Fodor's Choice.' Yet neither of these other two wineries received mention, so anyone relying solely on this guide would miss these opportunities. I found the same issues with hotels, restaurants and entertainment destinations. The information is often stale and occasionally flat out wrong.In summary, Fodor's is quaint, but less and less useful with every passing year. There's no excuse for leaving out smartphone aps and resource listings for online information that is updated monthly, weekly and daily. Unless Fodor's evolves, it is bound to follow Collier's Encyclopedia.Rating: Three stars.

Having read an earlier version of Bill James' classic historical abstract, I purchased this as updated version as a gift for a friend who works as a baseball announcer for the local American Legion team.I recommend this book as a gift for baseball aficionados; more than a book or a reference, it is a treasury that will be not be found tucked away on a bookshelf but readily available, pages marked up and dog-eared, and enjoyed for many years.Amazon lists this book for less than $20. With more than 1,000 pages, The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract is an outstanding value; rating: Five stars.

We bought this during the potty training period for our two sons. Unlike most books that are dipped in PC language and child psychology, this book cuts right to the chase. The father smokes a pipe. The baby has his legs splayed right open. And there's poop. Lots of it.This is high comedy for young boys. I'm not sure if there's much long-term education value but our kids liked the book and it made them laugh.I'd have given it four stars if the book had offered a conclusion that either (1) left my kids with a message or (2) provided me with a better springboard to discuss potty training.

The ability for two or more kids to play from one game makes this a great addition to your Nintendo DS collection. You can use the single-card feature, which allows one player to start the game and the other player to join in and play.My two sons, ages 6 and 4, love this game. They race against each other and sometimes team up and challenge the field. The game is fun and addictive.Occasionally, they will ask, "Papa, do you want to race with me?" I'll agree and then be quickly schooled by my 4-year old.Pros:The controls are easy to learn and easy to operate for little hands.The game is fun and has many different tracks and characters to keep your young child entertained.The single-card multiplayer feature offers added value to your purchase!In summary, this is a great buy if you're looking for a family-friendly Nintendo DS game that young kids, older kids and adults can enjoy together.

Looking for Batman toys for little kids who are too young to watch The Dark Knight movie but are old enough to like superheroes?We bought two LeapFrog LeapPads a couple years ago and ordered this Batman book along with the Spider-Man book and The Incredibles book. Our two children have been using these books regularly.The book provides language and math skills for first- and second-grade students. My kids started using this book at age three, at first only able to touch the pen to the words and listen to the narrator.Now, my kids read along and have improved their math skills, too.

As you know from my other reviews, I'm the chief rib tickler and bedtime book reader for two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old.Boys like books with scary things that aren't *too* scary.Boys like gross things, like a shark's liver (page 10), a shark's ear (page 17), and a shark's lower intestines (page 27).This is a great learning book. Yes, it is gross, but the pictures are nothing more graphic than what you'd find in natural science magazines.

Artists are fortunate to have one great piece of work in a lifetime. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant had that hit withThe Office.Who would've guessed they could return with another two-season series that delivers great dark comedy?This series tackles the serfdom of the entertainment world, where the stars are royalty and the extras are treated like slaves.You will laugh. You will cringe. You'll often do both at the same time.Gervais slips into the skin of another obnoxios and foul character, Andy Millman, but in no way repeats his portayal of motivational boss David Brent. The two characters do share one thing in common though. By the end of the two series, these irritating, ridiculous men are sad figures we pity.

I have two small dogs and they have trouble digesting most of the treats I find at the store. Either the biscuits are too big or are coated with something that doesn't agree with the dogs' stomach.This was the first dog treat we found that the dogs wouldn't throw up. And, if cuteness is important to you, the heart-shaped treats fit the bill.When I want my dogs to come in from the backyard I simply have to shake this bag and immediately there are sitting on the back porch waiting for a Newman's snack.I added this product to our Amazon Subscribe & Save program, which saves us more money and a shopping trip, too.

The best produced film adaptation of Marvel Comics famous vigilante, "Punisher: War Zone" is violent, sadistic and gory.And those are compliments.This adaptation benefits from a better cast, higher production values and a run time that is 37 minutes shorter than the last version. Punisher was previously portrayed byDolph Lundgrenin 1989 andThomas Janein 2004. This time around Ray Stevenson is Frank Castle, a.k.a. Punisher, facing off against a mobster named Billy Russoti.In an homage to another famous comic book origin, whenBatmandropped the Joker into a vat of chemicals, the Punisher drops Russoti into a glass-crushing machine, creating the villian Jigsaw. Buried beneath a mask of scar tissue is Dominic West, best known for his portrayal of Detective Jimmy McNulty inThe Wire. Ironically, West also had a minor role in300, which was infamous its gory violence, too.West and Doug Hutchison (who plays Jigsaw's brother, James Russoti) give an over-the-top performance that channels Anthony Hopkins'Dr. Hannibal Lecterand Robert De Niro'sMax Cady.In summary, while this is the best adaptation yet, the film won't attract much of an audience beyond die-hard fans. The film's gross revenue reflected that reality. UnlikeIron Man, the Punisher doesn't have crossover appeal.BTW: The Punisher was a fresh character for Marvel Comics in 1974, first appearing in The Amazing Spider-Man #129 (I own it and, no, it is not for sale). The fact that Hollywood has tried not once but three times to bring his story to the screen illustrates how much the character still resonates 35 years later.

My two sons, ages 6 and 4, have a large rug in their bedroom that is a map of the world. On that map, they build and play and pretend, consuming hours, afternoons, weekends.I'm happy that even today a set of wooden toys can capture the imagination of children despite the competion of video games and TV and electronic toys that require batteries.This set includes 100 pieces and serves as a great starter set and introduction to Lincoln Logs. It comes with building instructions for several building configurations.If your children like this set I recommend you might consider the larger set,K'NEX Collector's Edition Lincoln Logs Wooden Casewhich has 151 pieces but costs three as much as this set.

Chewy strawberry fish gels are an application as tricky as its description. Both of our sons tolerate the flavor although our oldest son recently began to swallow the soft gels because he's under the impression that anything `chewable' is only for little children.We give each boy (ages 8 and 7) four soft gels per day, as per the directions.Nordic Naturals Children's DHA Chewable Soft Gelsare the least disliked of the fish oils products we've given our children. "Tolerated" is as good a recommendation as you can expect; Nordic Naturals marketing department overhypes its formula, suggesting that their "fish oil formulas so fresh, pure, and great tasting that kids consistently ask for more!" Just be happy if your children take the soft gels without argument; don't expect them these to become a candy substitute.As far as the health benefits, we see a marked improvement in our youngest son's allergies and asthma since he started taking this fish oil supplement. My wife is very happy with these supplements and will continue to provide them for our sons.Ingredients: Purified arctic cod liver oil, soft gel capsule (gelatin, water, glycerin, strawberry essence), d-alpha tocopherol, strawberry essence, rosemary extract. Four 250 mg Soft Gels Contain: EPA: 82 mg, DHA: 125 mg, Other Omega-3s: 45 mg, Vitamin A: 130 - 300 IU, Vitamin D: 1 - 4 IU, Vitamin E: 14 IU.The only thing we wish is that this product was available through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program, so we could enjoy an additional 15% savings.Rating: Five stars.

My sons' book collection consists mainly of early readers and picture books authored by Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle, Stan & Jan Berenstain and Maurice Sendak, among others. My boys are currently ages 6 and 4 and we read 2-3 books a night (you can check out my bedtime book list here on Amazon).Naturally, I was a little concerned about reading a picture book of a poem that finishes each rhyme with "perhaps she'll die." At first, my boys were a little surprised by the line but, by the end of the book, they were giggling heartily. If you don't already know, the little old lady swallows larger and larger creatures in an effort to rid herself of the fly.The moral of the story is "Never swallow a horse."Earlier this year, I readThe Tale of Despereaux, which has a target audience of 8-to-12-year olds. That story has some difficult elements, including physical abuse, but my sons handled it. We discussed the characters and their troubles at the end of each chapter. Perhaps, you'll need to do the same with "There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly" so your child can enjoy the silliness of the rhyme.In summary, this makes a good, silly bedtime story. The die-cut illustrations (showing each creature the old lady has swallowed) balance nicely with the verse. Rating: four stars.

A perfect start to our family's Halloween bedtime readings; this delightfully spooky story follows the pilfering of a bone from Nicholas Greebe's shallow grave and a century of weird events that transpire until the bone is returned. Nicholas Greebe's ghost chants:"From this night forthI quest, I questtill all my bonestogether rest."My sons (ages 8 and 7) enjoyed this book. I narrated the book, borrowing Vincent Price's voice and cadence. Author Tony Johnston opens with the following text artfully placed between the winding limbs of a winter tree: "In Colonial times, quiet Massachusetts valleys--dark with trees, threaded with rivers, and often cloaked in fog--gave rise to thoughts of the supernatural. There, among hidden hills, tales of haunts and ghosts abounded. Tales such as this one..."We generally set aside 15-20 minutes each night for bedtime readings and alternate between chapter and picture books.The Ghost of Nicholas Greebewas a perfect length (32 pages). S.D. Schindler's artwork balances the story, e.g. his illustration of the whaler mesmerized my sons as I read "While Nicholas Greebe's ghost searched in vain, the pilfered bone had begun a remarkable journey."Some of the new vocabulary my sons learned:PewterMidstResonantLevitationPilferedScrimshawFlukeSatchelIn summary,The Ghost of Nicholas Greebeis an enjoyable ghost story that deftly manages to be spooky without being scary, matching its kindergarten-to-third grade audience. I highly recommend this book for bedtime reading, especially around the Halloween holiday. Rating: Four stars.

I like this story because it addresses a problem a lot of young children have when they get overexcited. They forget to listen.Thomas is chosen to run on new tracks and in his excitement he fails to listen to advice from Sir Topham Hatt, Edward and Thomas' driver.We have several other Thomas books that were regulars in our bedtime reading collection. I say "were" because my sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old and both are a little too old for these picture books. Aim to read these with your 2-3-year olds.

My two sons, ages 6 and 4, are not easily scared. They love for me to read bedtime books about snakes, spiders and bugs. So, I didn't hesitate to add Boogie Bones when my 4-year old saw the book's cover, a skeleton doing a Fred Astaire move in a graveyard.Boogie Bones' enthusiasm is undeniably cute. However, the story's whimsical tone is uneven.Boogie disguises himself in a tuxedo, fake hair, patent leather shoes and a hat to attend the county's dance contest. A boogie move freely among the living, his dancing is even cheered, until "his hat flew off...and he wiggled right out of his tuxedo." The frightened adults (the dance judge faints "dead away") scream until a little girl announces, "I'm not afraid of any old bones!" and joins him on the dance floor. Boogie goes on to win the dance competition and brings the trophy back to his graveyard.At the book's end, my 4-year old asked me where skeletons go. Before I could answer, his 6-year old brother said, "In the ground." That response led to several minutes of questions about skeletons, death and burial.Any remaining whimsy the book held had fallen away like Boogie's disguise on the dance floor.This excerpt further illustrates the book's uneven tone, "The bearded dancer grew so jealous, he dropped his partner in mid-dip and flounced off the dance floor in a rage." That sentence, and the illustration of the woman splayed across the dance floor, was jarring for a children's picture book.In summary, while the story had great potential, I recommend young readers pass on Boogie Bones.

This is the first Nintendo DS superhero video game that I've sold off. My kids were really excited to try Spider-Man 3 (having played the GBA games before). After the first day, my kids won't pick this game up anymore.Why?Well, the combination of button controls and stylus web swinging is just too much for their little hands. They are overwhelmed by the controls. I've read a bunch of reviews that like the use of the stylus but even those reviews admit that you get mixed results (your intended move doesn't always translate on screen).Meanwhile, my kids were underwhelmed by the gameplay. You'd think New York City is populated by 98% felons. Spider-man doesn't meet anyone who he doesn't have to punch, kick or throw around. Quickly, this becomes work instead of play.My kids preferSpider-Man: Friend or Foeand frequently play together (Check out my Amazon review: I bought an extra copy so they could play together.)Much was made about the Tobey Maguire voiceovers but they didn't lend enough to this game to add another star. My kids liked theIron Manvoiceovers better.Now that the Spider-Man 3 movie release is a year old, I can't imagine most kids would be intested in this title. I hope new superhero games are released on the Nintendo DS, just not games as much work as this.

Here's the old school Joker, perfectly dressed in purple. He comes with a snapping jaw weapon that is fun to open and click but safe enough so that young boys can play with it safely (my sons love to stick their fingers into the jaws and have it gently clamp down).We've had this action figure for nearly two years now (it was originally released in 1994) and it is still in great shape. Durability is important when you have a 5-year old and a 4-year old mashing action figures together.

We tried this gadget a half dozen times this summer to no avail. The holes fit jalapenos but not much else. The holes are too small to hold the peppers without them falling over. Use toothpicks to prevent your peppers from falling over before you can retrieve them from the grill.I'm going to sell off this gadget and keep on the lookout for a better grilling tool.In the meantime, check out these handy grilling tools that will expand your menu:Steven Raichlen Best of Barbecue SR8016 Stainless-Steel Beer-Can Chicken Rack with Drip Pan; andOutset QN77 Copper Nonstick Grill Skillet with Removable Soft-Grip Handle.I have positive reviews on both products.

We have 5-6 of the Berenstain Bears books that we mix into our bedtime reading library.This book, "Forget Their Manners," is especially handy for bedtime reading when I want to stimulate a discussion about a lapse of manners at the dinner table.By the time I finish reading, my children are openly talking about their recent bad manners and resolving to improve their behavior.I also recommend these other Berenstain Bears' books:The Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TVThe Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers

I've reviewed many of the Berenstain Bears books available at Amazon. I mix these books into the bedtime reading rotation for our two young sons. I like these books because they allow me to review manners, morales and important lessons at the end of the day."Learn About Strangers" is as important a topic as it is difficult to teach without scaring your kids. This book shows how everyone needs to be aware of their surroundings. At different points in the story, both of the young bears get caught up and forget the book's lesson. Fortunately, their sibling is able to help remind them to be careful.I also recommend these other Berenstain Bears' books:The Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TV

With the advice of Consumer Reports (CR) I purchased this Hamilton Beach model instead of George Foreman's grills. CR listed this as a best buy and noted that it offered two grilling sizes in one unit, a 60-square-inch surface that works best for hamburgers and chicken breasts and a full 120-square-inch double grill when you open it up. I use the double grill for vegetables (asparagus, green onions, squash).The plates are removable and easy to clean. I usually just wash them in the sink and wipe them down, skipping the dishwasher, because the nonstick surface works well.If you are cooking at home to stay healthy and to save money, this grill from Hamilton Beach is a great addition to your kitchen.

Pleased with our first playset purchase --Mattel Matchbox 360 Pop-Up Pirate Island(see my review) -- we bought the Ratatouille Kitchen Chaos Playset.So, why the low ratings for Ratatouille?1. The playset doesn't offer much to do. There aren't many accessories, certainly not enough to pretend cooking, which we thought was the point of a kitchen playset. You get a couple pots and ladles but nothing to put inside the pots.2. The playset needs to include more characters. You get Remy the rat. That's it. So, you playtime consists of Remy wandering around an empty kitchen (no food) and nobody else around.A playset should include enough items to make it fun by itself. This is actually a Ratatoille accessory. If you own a lot of the other movie-related toys, you'll enjoy this toy more.

Both of my young sons love pirate stories and they took to this one quickly, although the book needed some parental editing.Two problems:Jeremy Jacob takes off without telling his parents -- I reinforced with my kids that Jeremy shouldn't leave with the pirates without asking his mother or father.The author perpetuates an unhealthy attitude towards children eating vegetables, with Jeremy happily announcing that he won't have to eat either spinach or carrots aboard the pirate ship.One positive:Jeremy Jacob comes to realize that living like as a pirate means there isn't someone to read him bedtime stories or hold him close when he is scared.Overall, this is a fun bedtime book but be careful you're not teaching your children bad behaviors and habits along the way.

We have two boys -- ages 5 and 4 -- so we were looking for a fun, family-friendly outdoor game to help us fill the summer days. We purchased this bocce set because:* Four people can play* The balls are light and small enough to fit young hands* We can play the game everywhere - lawns, beaches, parks* The game comes with its own carrying case* The game is very affordable - we picked up ours for less than $20!This is a lot of fun, easy to learn and play, and is very durable!

My sons (ages 6 and 4) love this new animated series, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The show is much better suited for younger audiences than Spider-Man's last animated series, which lasted only one season on MTV in 2003.This series features all of Spider-Man's most famous villians, including the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Rhino and Electro.In Volume 4, Peter Parker dons the black suit, faces the Sinister Six (Vulture, Electro, Shocker, Sandman, Rhino, and Doctor Octopus) and ends the first season against his deadliest foe, Venom/Eddie Brock. Volume 4 has four episodes: Episode 10: "Persona"; Episode 11: "Group Therapy"; Episode 12: "Intervention" and Episode 13: "Nature vs. Nurture".If you absolutely must buy a DVD right now (birthday present, etc.) this is a good choice for Spider-Man fans. Amazon has the DVD priced $5 below suggested retail price ($19.95) and this is a good choice for young children who love Spider-Man.The more economical decision is to wait for a DVD set release of all 26 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2, which should be priced around $30. It was announced earlier this year that Season 2 would move from the CW network to Disney XD. Season 2 is scheduled to begin in March 2009. However, the Spectacular Spider-Man ended production after completing the 26th episode (the end of Season 2). A third season might happen, depending on the ratings Season 2 gets on Disney XD.In summary, I'd rate The Spectacular Spider-Man series five stars based on the entertainment value for young superhero fans. The shows are accessible without being too scary or adult for the under-10 audience. However, by marketing the first season into four DVDs, I deduct two stars. The series is overpriced, especially in light of the current economy.

Nicole Kidman has succumbed to her unflinching forehead.No longer able to wrinkle and bend it to project emotion, Nicole searches out blank-faced roles. As Joanna, she pretended to be a robot inThe Stepford Wivesand here, as psychiatrist Carol Bennell, she spends much of her time pretending to be an emotionless alien.The movie can't decide its genre; a mishmash of car chases and clunky dialogue that never manages to be scary. I recommend you watch the originalInvasion of the Body Snatchersor the 1978 remake,Invasion of the Body Snatchersinstead.A more interesting approach in this film would've been to cast Kidman's real life ex-husband, Tom Cruise, as Tucker, the ex-husband who infects Carol with a gross, face-to-face vomiting sequence. Instead, we get Jeremy Northam, who despite a healthy amount of staring and stalking, never exudes the menace necessary to be cast as the main villain.One last note, this is the first of two movies to star Kidman and Daniel Craig. The other isThe Golden Compass, in which her simian counterpart projected a wider range of emotions than she did. The lack of chemistry between these two actors is surprising, especially considering Craig's resurgence in the James Bond franchise.

We purchased Twister to entertain about 15 children at our son's seventh birthday party. We set up a game table with four other games -Perfection,Operation,Wild Planet Hyper DashandiPlay Wok and Roll(I recommend you check out my Amazon reviews on these other games, too).Behind the game table, we placed Twister on a wide area of carpeted floor. The only rule we established was that the kids had to take their shoes off to play. We did not hover over the group or explain the rules. One boy picked up the spinner board and gave it a twirl. He announced "left hand green" and the game began. Over the next two hours, the kids (3-to-8-years old) played all of the games, coming back to Twister to play in pairs, small groups or groups of only boys or girls.Of all the games we placed out for the birthday party, Twister andWild Planet Hyper Dashallowed the children to release their energy the most (that was handy after we served birthday cake). Keep that in mind as you look for indoor games to get you through the winter.In summary, Twister consists of only a vinyl sheet and a spinner board, so you might think the game is too simple to entertain kids. However, that was not our experience. The children loved to tie themselves up in knots. Rating: Five stars.

We bought this for our young children (5-year old and 4-year old) as they were excited by thePirates of the Caribbeanmovies.We bought this book along withPirateology: The Pirate Hunter's Companionlast year. We take the books off the shelf every couple months and read through them for bedtime. The books will stay in our collection for years to come.This book helps introduces kids to a large amount of new vocabulary but, more importantly, covers so much ground that it acts as a fantastic springboard to further study history or science.

In the hands of Robert Zemeckis and Jim Carrey, Ebenezer Scrooge's tale delivers moments of true emotion - frightening, heartbreaking and uplifting. Yet, neither the 3-D animation nor Carrey's multi-character act elevate this version to the status of a Christmas classic.I preface I'm writing this review as a father of two sons (ages 8 and 6). We popped popcorn, poured glasses of Arnold Palmer and slipped into our pajamas for a family movie night. Having recently enjoyedThe Muppet Christmas Carol, I hoped my sons could enjoy (and follow) a gloomier interpretation of Dickens' classic that followed the original story closer than I had expected.Zemeckis employs the performance-capture technique previously used inThe Polar ExpressandBeowulf. The animation provides some amazing visuals, making it possible for Scrooge to fly Victorian England or shrink to mouse size for an icicle ride across rooftops. The ghost of Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Future were exceptionally scary (my six-year jumped when Marley's visage first appeared on Scrooge's doorknocker). However, the animation distracts as much as it dazzles, especially during longer stretches of dialogue. Aside from the skeletal Scrooge, Zemeckis envisions the rest of the cast as a fleshy, pig-faced people whose ugliness is off-putting.Scrooge is an amalgamation of Carrey's previous roles. You'll see a sneer that echoes Count Olaf fromLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Eventsand then hear a laugh reminiscent of The Grinch fromHow the Grinch Stole Christmas. Carrey's performances as the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future are for vanity's sake. My six-year old detected the same actor played Scrooge and the Ghosts, a revelation that only served to pull him from the narrative.Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Cary Elwes and Bob Hoskins join Carrey in playing multiple roles. It is hard to understand why though because only Oldman, who portrays both Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit, delivers two unique and satisfying performances. Marley is gruesome (much more horrifying than the Ghost of Christmas Future), while Cratchit is endearing and childlike, especially so during his commute home on Christmas Eve.In summary, this movie is a mess and falls well short of being a Christmas classic. Dickens classic proves beyond the creative talents of Carrey and Zemeckis, who are unsure how to present this tale. Dark and gloomy dialogue is followed byTom and Jerryaction scenes.Rating: Two stars.If you have young children, I recommendThe Muppet Christmas Carolinstead.

I like Brita. I own a full-size pitcher, which I use daily at home.I bought the Brita Slim Pitcher for my office to use in a Sanyo SR-3770S Counter-High Refrigerator (great product, see my review). The pitcher fits tightly in the door, but there's so little usable space that I'm refilling the pitcher no less than 2-3 times per day.Looking back, I should've bought another full-size Brita pitcher and filled the ice cube trays with filtered water.The pitcher is top-heavy. When full, this isn't a problem. When you're trying to pour your second glass of water (and that's about all this pitcher can carry), the top tends to come off, so you'll have to hold it with one hand to prevent it from detaching and falling out.If space is a problem, consider buying reusable water bottles. You can store them in a compact refrigerator and refill them using a full-size Brita pitcher.

Noted as a "West Coast Favorite" this dark roast conjures up a scent of pine needles for me as it brews, a subliminal association perhaps tied more to the blend's name than the actual aromatics, which are pleasantly thick, sweet and strong enough to lift me from a groggy morning.I am still partial to Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, a recent purchase that knocked my socks off. Still, I would place Lake & Lodge a mere notch (star) beneath the Nantucket Blend. The Green Mountain website offers a fantastic description for Lake & Lodge: "This particular blend is very versatile, yet elegant. It makes a great espresso, partners well with cream, and is delicious iced. The flavors of this rich, darker roast blend reflect hearty West Coast style roasts. Dark roasted Indonesian coffees offer bountiful sweetness and syrupy notes. A touch of East African beans adds an element of berry-hued brightness to the blend's bold flavor foundations."I read that the blend's name has a peculiar history, first called "Tapestry Blend Dark" the blend was originally developed for a New York City shop called "The Coffee Station."Lake & Lodge is a better name, a blend that invokes ski resorts and campsites and sleepy mornings when a dark, bold roast is a welcome start to the day.Rating: Four stars.BTW: Here's my other recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:5 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend5 stars:Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast5 stars:Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle4 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry4 stars:Tully's Coffee Kona Blend4 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic3 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend3 stars:Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread

We expanded our collection of Berenstain Bears books this Christmas. Our sons, ages 6 and 4, enjoy these books and find it easy to relate to the young bears in the series. I like to mix these stories into our rotation of bedtime books as the need arises. That's how I came to buy "The Berenstain Bears and the Bad Dream."This past year has been an especially hard on the boys. All of the superhero movies they wanted to see -Iron ManandIncredible HulkandThe Dark Knight- were not appropriate for their age. I mention this because at the heart of this book is brother bear's desire to see "Space Grizzlies," a movie that leads to the titular bad dream. So, this book helped illustrate why I didn't want my sons to see PG- or PG-13-rated movies.This book hasn't stopped my sons from having bad dreams but it has become a useful resource that helps us talk through what causes bad dreams and why the dreams themselves can't hurt us.We also own and recommend:The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Help Around the HouseThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers

I bought this microwave in December 2005. It lasted until January 2012. I know this particular model is no longer available but I've had great success with the Panasonic brand.Consumer Reports highly ranked this particular 2.2-cubic foot, 1,250-watt microwave, so I bought it as a 2005 Christmas gift for my wife. I recommend Panasonic's inverter technology which makes sure each item is reheated evenly. You no longer have those frozen centeres and dried out edges that come with other microwaves.The only negative is the large amount of counter space this microwave uses. We use trivets to stack some other kitchen supplies on top of the microwaver but that isn't recommended by the manufacturer.We're going to buy a smaller microwave to replace this one. Our family needs have changed and we don't need 2.2 cubic feet of space anymore.

I needed a hand brush for general hand and nail cleaning. This brush provides two sets of medium bristles that are sturdy, yet comfortable to use. I don't like nail brushes that feel as though I am dragging steel bristles across my skin, so I prefer medium bristles.We purchased a pack ofEasy Hold nail brushesbut they were too small for my fingers to fit the grip. TheLola Nylon Hand & Nail Brushis three inches long and comes with a hardwood grip. Because the brush is made of wood instead of plastic you need to make sure the brush can dry properly between uses. If you don't want to bother with drying the brush, Lola also sells a plasticLola Hand & Nail Brush.I really like Lola brand brushes, whether it is nail brushes for personal hygiene or aVegetable and Dishwashing Brushfor kitchen use. However, my one complaint is that the company doesn't sell their products directly on Amazon.com, so you have to purchase the brushes through another supplier (in this case, it is Harold Imports). That drives up the price, which is often higher than can be found at traditional stores.Rating: four stars.

An adventurous bunny slips into the house while the family is away at Grandma's house. The book details the bunny's exploration and hijinks and provides a funny surprise ending that led my sons (ages 6 and 4) to ask me to read it again immediately.The picture book claims to be based on a true story (and even includes a picture of the actual bunny that inspired this book). I'm sure it was true that a bunny managed to sneak into Ho Baek Lee's house but I'm just as sure the bunny didn't manage to ski down the hallway with a pair of chopsticks and a rollerblade. The artwork reflects the blending of the true and the imaginary. The result is a sweet, fun picture book that my sons have enjoyed over and over again at bedtime.In summary, this is an enjoyable tale with an endearing character. I recommend it to parents with young children, especially if they have a child who like bunny rabbits. While not a classic, this story is much better than most picture books I've reviewed for Amazon (and please check out my Amazon lists of bedtime books for young boys).Rating: four stars.

We have the entire set, all six volumes.We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old. Our kids love these DVDs. The series is family-friendly and I like the fact that I don't have to suffer through an hour of "I wants" following a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.If you have young children, this is a great buy because the individual stories run about 5-8 minutes each. You can moderate how much they watch without having to commit to a 90-minute Disney movie.There are three sets of DVDs, each two volumes in length. The double sets are better priced than buying each volume individually. Check out my other Amazon review of the Mr. Bean animated series.

KA-ME green curry lunch boxes are an economical, healthy alternative to typical burger-and-fries fast food lunches. The green curry is creamy and flavorful but not hot and spicy. According to the package, this is an authentic Thai recipe.Preparation is a snap. There are two packets, one containing the jasmine rice and the other containing the curry sauce, bamboo shoots, coconut milk and green chilis, which pour over the rice before heating in the microwave. The cardboard box held together just fine and I had a hot lunch in two minutes.Each container lists two servings, each at 240 calories, so one box is 480 calories. While it would be nice if the calories were lower, the total still is not anywhere near as bad as fast food options. At the office, I rotate KA-ME green curry lunches with microwavable bowls of lentil soup and leftovers, so I do not eat the same thing repeatedly.In summary, these are an economical, healthy lunch option. They are easy to carry and prepare at the office. I would rate it higher if the calories were lower. Rating: Four stars.

I have a 5-year old and a 4-year old who both love all things Batman.There's no way I'm going to let them watch a PG-13 rated movie. So, "The Dark Knight" is going to have to wait.This DVD collection is my solution. While there still are some scares among these episodes, this collection is overall easy on young kids while still providing the action and excitement they crave.And if you want to add a Batman book for young readers, I recommendBatman: 4 Adventure Stories.BTW: Check out my Amazon Listmania Lists for parents of young boys:*Young boys' Batman/Dark Knight entertainment*Young boys' superhero books*Young boys' bedtime books*Young boys' Christmas bedtime books*Young boys' Nintendo DS games*Young boys' Nintendo DS superhero games

I'm not auditioning for a Rambo movie so my idea of carrying a knife is something small, subtle yet utilitarian. I like this knife because it is small, just 3 inches long closed and weighs 1.5 ounces.I work in an office environment and the knife is small enough to slip into my pants without being noticable. It fits nicely into the change pocket on a pair of Levi 501s, too.I carry a sharpening tool called a Speedy Sharp in my briefcase. It works for a quick fix. On weekends, I work the knife on a wet stone for a better edge. The stainless steel blade is durable and holding up very well.

My wife likes these pens. She works as a teacher's aide for a private school's pre-kindergarten class. She said the Bic Mark-it pens are excellent for the detail work needed on handmade signs, decorations and posters she prepares for her class. The 36 colors give her a wide palette, especially when using colored paper."Use these pens for detail and finish work," she told me. "Use something else if you are coloring in large areas that will use a lot of ink."She added that the pens are best for craft use and school decorations rather than for generic labeling. The pens perform well on paper, cardboard, felt and cloth (intended and unintended, so be careful!) The storage case is stylish and functional. Each pen has a comfortable rubber grip, too.Rating: Five stars.

After four family trips and countless hours of use, the Wagan 4-Way 12V Automotive Socket Extender continues to deliver as promised. This handy little gadget is value priced at under $10.A typical trip involves charging two cell phones and twoNintendo DS Litegame consoles. We chose not to install the mounting hardware since the cord is long enough to run between the front seats and reach the back of our car. Our sons simply wind up the 34" cord along with their Nintendo DS accessories.Each of the sockets provided a snug fit. Aside from an MP3 player or an electric blanket, I don't foresee using any larger electronic devices (e.g. portable TV).Rating: Five stars.

Empire Fallswon the Pulitzer Prize, so many people list that as the only Richard Russo book they've read (or watched, as the book was translated into an an HBO miniseries,Empire Falls, with the amazing cast of Ed Harris, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Helen Hunt, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Robin Wright Penn, Aidan Quinn, Theresa Russell and Dennis Farina.I like Richard Russo's books. I first readMohawk, followed that up withNobody's Fooland, finally, the aforementioned Empire Falls. The first chapter of Mohawk drew me in; the diner setting drew me in; I felt as though I could've pulled up a stool and ordered a breakfast special.In summary, Mohawk's wit and characterization echo in Russo's later work. Don't pass up this book. Rating: Four stars.

The first time we suited up our two sons in these costumes, they stood in front of a full-length mirror and admired their inflated muscles. We've got some great pictures!The costume is very durable and easy to store. We just hang them in the closet. We've owned two of these costumes for more than a year now. They come in very handy on rainy days, when the boys are confined to the house.Rechargable batteries help keep down the cost of repeated play; each suit uses four AA batteries so plan ahead!I recommend pairing the Superman Inflato Suit with theHeat Vision Setand theSuperman Bendable Steel Bar with Sound. I've reviewed those products, too. I didn't care much for the Punch N' Crush Gloves because the boys have to punch the air to activate the sound. The steel bar is better and eliminates the possibility of them accidentally punching something or someone.

I upgraded to this model after finally having to shelve my Logitech TrackMan Marble FX Trackball.I like this model because it is cordless and has a USB connection. I have larger hands, so the size isn't a concern. However, I can understand how users with smaller hands would find this design unworkable.I don't like Optical Trackman as much as the aforementioned Marble FX because:1. It doesn't stay as clean, so the ball jumps and skips;2. It doesn't have the finger-and-thumb control of the old version, so the movement isn't as precise;3. It isn't durable. I've worn out two models in three years. I'm on my third and I won't buy another when this one breaks.I'll be looking for a new trackball soon. Hopefully, Logitech will return to form.

Do you like a little political incorrectness during the holidays? Is gathering around the TV for a viewing ofBad Santaa Christmas tradition at your house?If you answered yes, pick up a copy of the The Trailer Park Boys Christmas Special which features Conky, the creepy puppet fromTrailer Park Boys: The Complete Fourth Season. This DVD provides a backstory to the main characters.Canada's mockumentary is a bold, unflinching look at the Sunnyvale Trailer Park, where Julian (John Paul Tremblay), Ricky (Robb Wells) and Bubbles (Mike Smith) hold court while constantly dodging the pseudo-authority of Lahey (John Dunsworth) and Randy (Patrick Roach).As a Christmas gift, I recommend you start withTrailer Park Boys: Season 1-2or try theTrailer Park Boys - The Movie. Here's the product description for the movie: "From producer Ivan Reitman comes Trailer Park Boys: The Movie-- a comedy full of drugs, alcohol and strippers."In summary, this Christmas special is very funny but you'll enjoy it even more if you've already been introduced to the main characters.

Most nights, sandwiched between my sons (ages 6 and 4) I read two books before they go to bed. We read 4-5 new stories each week and fill the rest of our time with favorites from their large bookshelf.I've come to learn that reading aloud is a partnership. The author and illustrator provide the basic tools but, ultimately, the reader must use them to bring the story to life for the audience. That energy starts with clear pronunciation and enunciation, building with rhythm and cadence, upon which voices (or impersonations) match the different characters and sound effects are layered to complete the story.Ultimately, "Boing" lives or dies depending on your performance. My sons loved this book. They have their own trampoline, so a story about the "Great Elastic Marvel" bouncing all over the city was a perfect match.For "Boing" I've got two tips:1. Narrate the book as though you are the ringmaster of a circus: "Ladies and Gentlemen...Children of all ages!"2. Place your hand on the book; when the Great Elastic Marvel bounces back into the sky, throw your hand into the air with an enthusiastic "Boing!"In summary, I highly recommend this book for bedtime reading. The Great Elastic Marvel landed a five-star rating from our sons.BTW: Check out my review ofThe Monster at the End of this Bookfrom my list of "Young boys' bedtime books" for more tips on reading aloud.

Which child hasn't heard ofCurious George, an icon of children's literature borne from the imagination of Margret & H.A Rey? While Whiteblack the Penguin is a lesser-known character, his story has both the look and tone you'd expect from a Curious George book.My sons, ages 6 and 4, enjoyed this book as a bedtime story. They especially enjoyed the watercolor illustrations, which are both vivid and plentiful.According to the publisher's note, this story was developed in 1937 but wasn't published until 63 years later, and then only by chance. Of course, several elements of Whiteblack's story reflect its age. For example, Whiteblack searches for stories to share on his radio show. However, the story's charm and innocence has aged well.Whiteback shares more in common with Curious George than recent penguins featured inHappy Feet,MadagascarorSurf's Up. Whiteblack would fit more comfortably with theMarch of the Penguins.In summary, my two sons enjoyed Whiteblack's story. This is a great find if your children are already fans of Curious George.

I keep a package of Plackers Dental Flossers at home and another in my shaving kit for overnight trips.The flosser is easy to grip and provides enough floss to get around every tooth. This is the best designed flossers I've found so far. The floss string is durable; I haven't had one break yet. I also like the pick end of the flosser, which I use to hook food particles from behind my teeth.These flossers and Brush Picks (see my Amazon.com review) are a great combination: no cavities found in my last four dental visits.

I'm amazed at how well this book has held up over the years. My two sons (now, ages 5 and 4) have been enjoying this book for years.Why? Well, we've made the book into an interactive bedtime reading experience. When we read "Wee Willie Winkie" I walk my fingers up their back and shoulders as though he's "running upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown." Many of the abbreviated stories require some action, such as playing patty cake or holding a stuffed animal for a quick rock-a-bye.By the time we reach the last story, Goodnight Bears, my kids are ready to drift off themselves. We extend the story so that they can wish each other, their parents and their stuffed animals goodnight, too.

The collection of short stories are snappy enough to keep you turning the pages. Starting from the front of the book, the quality wanes as you go deeper. The other reviews go into greater detail about each story, so I won't repeat that here.I picked up my copy for less than $3, so I'm not going to judge the book harshly. At that price, it was better entertainment than an in-flight movie or a magazine from the airport gift shop.

I've reviewed several of the Berenstain Bears books available at Amazon and find most of them to be very handy tools to reinforce good manners and behaviors with our young children.While this book isn't the best of the bunch it is good enough that I recommend it, especially if you're buying a set of books through Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion.Papa Bear once again takes the brunt of the jokes. As the little bears learn how important their help is to keeping the house clean and running smoothly, they have Papa Bear as a sort of comedic release valve.The lesson is simple: everyone needs to pitch in and help and not expect Mama Bear to do it all herself.If that is a lesson you need to reinforce in your home, this is a good tool to help you do it.I also recommend these other Berenstain Bears' books:The Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears Help Around the HouseThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TVThe Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers

Wireless DS multi-card play is what makes this game a huge hit in our family. Our two sons -- ages 5 and 4 -- are entertained by the teamwork option, playing as two superheroes or one as Spider-Man and the other as a villian -- the Green Goblin or Sandman or, their favorite villian, Venom.No doubt older kids will tire of the repetition, but I don't expect most teenagers will buy a superhero title, choosing instead an RPG or simulation.For little superheroes, this is a great little adventure and worth purchasing the extra copy so they can play together.

Every Friday, our family has a movie night at home. Our two sons, ages 6 and 4, get to pick out the DVD. We pop popcorn; we adjust the seats and the lighting; we make it an event.There are three signs that we've selected a good DVD:1. The popcorn is gone.2. No one gets out of their seat.3. We get a request to "watch it again" as the credits roll.About 30 minutes into Igor, both of my sons started fidgeting. Then, they rolled out of their seats and left the room, wandering into the kitchen and down the hall to their bedroom.There were no requests for a repeat viewing.The heart of the problem is that to appreciate this animated film you really need to have already watchedFrankenstein,The Bride of FrankensteinandYoung Frankenstein, the latter of which mined many of these same jokes nearly 25 years ago. Most six-year olds know very little about the Frankenstein story other than to recognize the iconic makeup Boris Karloff wore.I believe this story would work far better on the stage than as an animated film. Igor certainly could do no worse on Broadway as the stage adaptation of Shrek was cringe-inducing.In summary, this is an animated film too clever for its own good. Without a firm understanding of the Frankenstein story, much of the dialogue (and the dry wit) will fly over the heads of young children.

The book's message, "appearances can be quite deceiving," focuses on a spooky, old house with an elderly woman named Miz MGrizz. The little bears learn to not judge people unkindly by their appearance.This is a tricky message as so much of the parental advice prior to Halloween is for kids to be on their guard.The book does reinforce some great Halloween safety messages:1. Stay in your own neighborhood.2. Don't eat the treats until you get home and Mama Bear inspects them.I also recommend these other Berenstain Bears' books:The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with ChoresThe Berenstain Bears Forget Their MannersThe Berenstain Bears Get in a FightThe Berenstain Bears and Too Much TVThe Berenstain Bears Learn About Strangers

The Big Yellow Treasury is a great collection of three stories -- The Pony Show, The School Fair and Henry Goes to the Hospital -- all of which are great for early readers and perfect reading for bedtime.We own a number of Thomas books (check my other reviews). We've been reading this book for a couple years. My sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old. They are a little too old for the Thomas picture books, which are better for 2-3-year olds.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly 80-100 books and we have 6-7 Thomas books in our collection. I recommend this book for your bedtime reading.

Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor atBon App&eacute;titmagazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.Sriracha Remoulade1 cup mayonnaise1/4 cup sriracha2 tablespoons red wine vinegarWhisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.Fried Calamari1/2 cup calamari1 cup milk1 cup flour1/2 cup semolinaVegetable oil for fryingSalt and pepperSoak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings6 chicken wingsOil for frying3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce1 tablespoons sriracha1 tablespoons butter, softenedBaby mache or other lettuce to garnishFry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.Rating: Five stars

This is the anti-TV approach to weekend entertainment.I won't judge this book harshly as we picked up our copy for less than $4. You'll quickly see why this book was so popular during the 1920s and 1930s. You can simply open the book to any page and launch a discussion, a game or an adventure.This book is a good companion and should be on the bookshelf of every cabin, vacation house and weekend getaway spot. As such, it makes a great gift, too.

My sons have two Mr. Freeze action figures, this one and the newer design from "The Batman" animated TV show.This action figure is a lot of fun. Mr. Freeze comes with twin freeze ray guns and a backpack that fits over his back and carries a disc shooter that fires above his head.The toy is very durable. This action figure is played with a lot more than Batman's other villians because he comes with these great gadgets.We've owned it more than a year now and the only damage is a light scuffing to Mr. Freeze's helmet that comes from putting on and taking off the attachments.If your boys love to play with Batman action figures, this is the action figure for them.

I have two sons, ages 6 and 4, who enjoyed the DVDMadagascar. Every time King Julien XIII the Ring-tailed Lemur launched into the song "I Like to Move It" my sons would stand up and shake their tails. So, there was much anticipation for the DVD release ofMadagascar - Escape 2 Africaat our house.It was King Julien and The Penguins (Skipper, Rico, Kowalski, and Private) who drew the most laughs from my sons in the original movie. So, while the sequel comes with the short film, The Penguins of Madagascar, most of this movie focuses on the main cast of zoo animals - Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo - as they crash land in Africa en route to their return home to New York.Despite the reduced roles for the supporting cast Madagascar 2 is more than adequate entertainment for young children. However, this sequel solidifies my earlier opinion that DreamWorks Animation films are on a second tier below those from Pixar Animation Studios. Ten or twenty years from now, the Madagascar films won't age as well as classics likeWall-E,RatatouilleorThe Incredibles.Being second-tier isn't all bad though. I still recommend Madagascar and its sequel for young children instead ofThe Wild,Open Seasonand, most recently,Igor.In summary, Madagascar 2 is an entertaining DVD for a family movie night and a couple repeat viewings. It rates three stars; good, just not great. It won't age well, so enjoy it while it is fresh.

Our dogs now have kissable breath thanks to this peppermint gel. I'm no more interested in smooching my dogs now than before but I do appreciate their improved oral health.We chose the gel over the spray because our 11-year old female Miniature Schnauzer (Rosie) and 12-year old Cockapoo (Brandy) are less than agreeable when it comes to putting our fingers in their mouths. The gel clings to the finger brush long enough for us to cajole and tease our dogs into a complete brushing.It has been a month now since we purchasedPetzLife Oral Care Geland the improvement along the dogs' gum-line is already apparent. We're looking forward to keeping the plaque and tartar at bay with continued use.One note of caution: follow the directions regarding the dosage and your pet size, otherwise your dog might vomit after ingesting too much of the gel (so far, we haven't had this problem, knock wood).Ingredients: 100% all natural - grapefruit seed extract, grape seed extract, rosemary oil, thyme oil, neem oil, peppermint oil, distilled water, grain alcohol.Rating: Five stars.

This modest fable about faith and hope aims to move its audience and, while occasionally succeeding, the indie film also stumbles into the clich&eacute;s and contrived plot devices common to the genre. The story's emotional ride resembles a pulled train more than a rocket, snaking around the characterization and details necessary to escalate the narrative.Based on a script by Albert Torres, the movie serves as catharsis for Director Mark Pellington, who four years earlier lost his young wife to complications from a ruptured spleen. Pellington's direction here is noticeably lighter than in eitherThe Mothman PropheciesandArlington Road.Luke Wilson stars as Henry Poole, a man with a rare, terminal disease (we never learn the name) who moves back to his old neighborhood for solitude and a quiet death. He solemnly executes his plan until a water stain on his house attracts his neighbor's attention (Adriana Barraza as Esperanza). She sees the healing image of Jesus.Others soon come to see the miraculous image. Henry is drawn into their lives against his wishes for privacy.I forgave the story's inclusion of a cute child, a sexy (and single) neighbor and the quirky yet wise observer. However, the pop music montages were overkill. Better suited for stage direction - scene closes, cue song, close curtains - the emotional soundtrack (including Bob Dylan's "Not Dark Yet") wore me down. After the third montage, I expected Pellington to employ the one-word cue card routine from Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues music video, featured on hisDon't Look Back 1965 Tour Documentary.Despite some minor sins, "Henry Poole is Here" is a satisfying indie drama that should appeal to believers and atheists alike.

While the title sums up the storyline -- a day in the life of Danny, a boy, and his friend, the dinosaur -- the story is full of make believe and magic that was absolutely riveting to my young boys.The words and the concepts are nicely focused on Level 1 readers (early reader). The book also offers a nice primer for children getting ready to attend a friend's birthday party as the illustrations show many of the iconic activities and how well-behaved children should act in that situation.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly nearly 100 books and Syd Hoff has two other titles in our collection,Danny and the Dinosaur and Happy BirthdayandOliverthat I recommend, too.

We passed on this movie when it hit the theatres last year, opting to wait for DVD. I'm glad we did because Bolt is clearly among the second tier of animated films from 2008 withMadagascar - Escape 2 Africa,IgorandSpace Chimps.With a nod towardUnderdog, Bolt is a dog portraying a superhero learns he doesn't have super powers but finds within himself the strength to still be a hero. John Travolta provides Bolt's voice and would win the honor of the worst miscasting if it were not for Miley Cyrus as Penny, Bolt's beloved owner and co-star of his superhero TV show.Neither Travolta nor Cyrus improve this film. They provide names for the marketing department but neither of them breathes life into their animated character. Instead, it is Mark Walton who steaks every scene voicing Rhino, the ball-enclosed hamster who is Bolt's #1 fan.Despite the poor casting and the tired story, the film quality is excellent. The colors are vibrant and the animation is of a much higher quality than what appeared on Space Chimps. There's even one must-see bonus feature - Super Rhino - that (smartly) features the movie's funniest character.In summary, Bolt provides mediocre family entertainment. You can do worse but you'd do much better watchingWall-E,Kung Fu PandaorHorton Hears a Whoinstead.

Posable, richly designed and fun to play with, this is the only Penguin action figure we can recommend. The design comes from "The Batman" animated TV show but isn't so drastic a change as the redesigned Joker.Because of his size and shape, the Penguin can't be moved into as many positions (as the Joker, for example) despite being fully articulated. That's really the only drawback. My sons often play with this action figure without using the swinging ball accessory just because the Penguin is more often the criminal mastermind and less often engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Batman.

If you have only the time available to watch a single DVD of the Trailer Park Boys, make it this one. However, I'd recommend that you watch the TPB series first and save this movie until the end.Check out my longer review of Trailer Park Boys Seasons 1 & 2 if you're unsure about this comedy.The biggest difference between this movie and the first season is the emergence of Bubbles, the kitten-owning, guitar-strumming, Rush-loving man living in a shed.

We used ceramic spoon rests but every one of them ultimately snapped at the handle's curve. We would glue them back together and limp along until we replaced it with another ceramic. This time around, we chose RSVP for the security and practicality stainless steel offers.As for the double-spoon design...yes, yes, we saw it, too. We have two sons, ages 9 and 8. It took them no less than a minute to break out into uncontrolled laughter when we pulled the RSVP spoon rest out of the box. Depending on which side you are viewing, it looks very much like a stainless steel baby's bottom or a shiny pair of cattle testicles. I highly doubt you could place this on the Thanksgiving dinner table without eliciting a chuckle from one distant relative.Laughs aside, the spoon rest has several excellent qualities. Surprisingly thin and light, it escapes being a cumbersome paperweight while still providing a sturdy rest for spoons, spatulas and ladles (our favorite being thePaderno World Cuisine 4-Ounce Long-Handled Composite Ladle). An added bonus is that the spoon rest is dishwasher safe.Rating: Five stars.

Honestly, we bought this hoping it was the magic key that would unlock our household from a life of servitude to night pants.Well, that didn't work.The DVD is cute. Bear is kind. But nothing magical resulted from repeat viewings. In fact, our kids quickly grew tired of the DVD after the fifth or sixth viewing, so now it gathers dust and is soon to be a candidate for a garage sale table.

I have two young boys (ages 6 and 4) so I'm always on the lookout for a book that reinforces good manners and behaviors to mix into our bedtime reading rotation.Elbert's Bad Word tackles bad language, one of the less common behavior topics addressed in children's books. Author Audrey Wood brings the bad word to life first as "a small storm cloud...ugly and covered with dark, bristly hairs" that Elbert overhears at a garden party and stuffs into his back pocket (because he hasn't heard it before). A croquet mallet falls on Elbert's foot and he shouts out the word, which transforms into a large monster that shocks the party guests.As punishment, his mother makes him scrub his tongue with soap.Elbert searches out help from the family's gardener (his family is wealthy) who also happens to be a practicing wizard. The gardener introduces new words and bakes them into a cupcake that Elbert consumes before heading back to the garden party. Another croquet mallet falls on Elbert's foot and he shouts the gardner's words instead:My stars! Thunder and Lightning! Rats and blue blazes! Suffering cats! Blistering Hop Toads! Zounds and gadzooks!While I appreciate the author's intent the book is not without flaws. Few children will relate to the decadent garden party where "Chives the butler tripped on Madame Friatta's feathered boa." And the only standout character is the wizard gardener, who sadly is left unnamed.In summary, Elbert lacks the charm necessary to connect with readers. However, this book manages to put a face, appropriately a monster's face, on bad language that children will find interesting. That achievement alone makes this book a useful resource for parents. Rating: Four stars.

I paid $2.99 with free shipping. The batteries are not old or counterfeit. I used them to replace the ones in my garage door openers. It is a pain in the neck to hunt around the city, trying to find which store carries these batteries (many stores don't carry these less popular types).The transaction was simple, easy and relatively painless. I'll update my review should I encounter a problem with the batteries in the near future. For now, I recommend buying the batteries directly from Amazon as I've never had a problem returning an item if it didn't meet my satisfaction.Rating: Five stars.+1 for Amazon's customer service

It was perfect for quiet play and indoor play during winter.2. We reinforced good eating habits during meals with the playset.3.

If you are getting close to retirement, or you are not close, but are considering starting a plan or withdrawing or rolling over your hard earned funds, this book is for you.In plain and crisp language, this book describes (1) various types of retirement plans, (2) tax rules governing retirement savings, and (3) the mechanics and impacts of various retirement payment methods. In other words, the book describes what to do before and after retirement so that you maximize your funds and minimize taxes. The authors make their work understandable, while raising the discussion at least one step above what you might find in a "Retirement for Dummies" volume.I have friends on all points of the retirement continuum. Some are just starting, others are mid-career, and a lucky few are counting the days until their most onerous task each day will be fetching the mail. This book would be a valuable addition to everyone's bookshelf.Rating: Five stars

While this book isn't the best of the collection it is still good enough to recommend, especially if you're purchasing your books using Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion.This story serves as a bookend toThe Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Chores, reinforcing the importance of everyone helping out at home.

These Caramel 'N Chocolate bars work well as either a breakfast substitute or an afternoon sweet snack. The flavor is candy bar sweet, with a texture that reminded me of packed brown sugar. Personally, these are too sweet for my breakfast, so I ate them in that gap time between lunch and dinner.My trick was to open the wrapper lengthwise and use myGerber Pocket Knifeto cut the bar into 8-10 bite-sized pieces. I slowly devoured the pieces with aContigo 16-Ounce Double Wall Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumblerfilled with eitherTully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra-BoldorCoffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold.Each Caramel 'N Chocolate bar is 1.76-ounces and contains 14g protein, 1g sugar, 190 calories and only 2g net carbs.I ordered these bars along with an order ofAtkins Cinnamon Bun Day Break Bars. Surprisingly, theBalance Carb Well Nutrition Energy Bar, Caramel 'N Chocolateare larger, cheaper and have fewer carbs per serving than the Atkins bar. For those reasons, I'm giving Balance Carb Well a four-star rating (one higher than the one I gave the Atkins bars).

On fitful nights, when my boys are having trouble getting to sleep, I read them this story. Thomas can't fall asleep and awakens another train, who sends him off in search of shooting star just to get some quiet. Thomas' search results in meeting several other friends but no shooting star. Finally, exhausted, Thomas returns to the train shed and falls asleep.The message is subtle enough to share without belaboring the point. The illustrations are very nice and I like both the pacing and the length of the story (as one other reviewer said, the book is the perfect length for a bedtime story).We own a number of Thomas books (check my other reviews). This is one of the better stories we've come across.

I purchased this in February 2007 along with the Nonstick 4-Piece Egg/Pancake Ring Set. Using them together, I can prepare weekend breakfasts of pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, sausages and potatoes O'Brien. There's plenty of room on this griddle to feed my family of four.The only complaint I have is that the griddle slides a little on my double burner. This works best on a perfectly flat surface. So, I use it on my gas grill, too.

Amazon has this book available through their 4-for-3 promotion. Take advantage of the savings and build your child's book collection.Like Danny's Dinosaur, Oliver the Elephant is a kindly big fellow with the heart of a child. Naturally, my two young boys loved the idea of playing with an elephant who would let them ride on his back and slide down his trunk.My sons' bookshelf holds roughly 80-100 books and Syd Hoff has three titles in our collection -- Oliver, Danny and the Dinosaur and Happy Birthday, Danny and the Dinosaur.

I picked this up as part of Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion (see my review of the Outset QN77 Copper Nonstick Grill Skillet with Removable Soft-Grip Handle). After giving this a try on our gas grill, I will NEVER buy roasted chicken again.The results were fantastic. Cleanup was a cinch. And we paid less than $1 per pound for whole chicken!My family all liked how moist the chicken turned out. I was thrilled not to have a huge mess to clean in the grill.Why buy this device?1. The drip pan is deep enough to keep grease off your grill.2. The pan is sturdy and well made.3. The four parts are easy to assemble and clean.If beer isn't your flavor, try orange juice, wine or a mojito (Bacardi sells a bottled version if you don't have rum, lime and mint handy).Here's a warning though: don't obliterate the chicken with a bottle of BBQ sauce. Use dry rubs and fresh herbs - rosemary and thyme or sage and garlic. Not only is this healthier than dumping what amounts to sweet tomato sauce and high-fructose corn syrup all over your meat, it tastes a whole lot better, especially, if you serve it with fresh, grilled vegetables (check out that copper nonstick grill skillet I mentioned earlier).

Come bedtime, my sons like to snuggle up with their teddy bears and listen to a couple stories before going to sleep. I looked around for a story that centered around a child's stuffed animal and found Knuffle Bunny.This is a cute, engaging book that holds up for repeated readings despite being a short story. Each time my sons would read along I'd interject more vocabulary from the photographs.Highly recommended for young kids.

You'll laugh but this movie isn't for the easily offended. Heck, even a few hard-to-offend viewers will cringe, too. A comedy hasn't had this much in-your-face political incorrectness sinceBlazing Saddles.You'll be worn out by the end of this two-hour movie but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The hardest laughs come all too quickly before the film settles down to a slower pace.The story follows a group of high-maintenance actors on the set of a Vietnam war movie that is spinning out of control and likely to become the all-time box office flop, pushing asideCutthroat Island,The Adventures of Pluto NashandBasic Instinct 2.Ben Stiller has the most screen time but Robert Downey Jr. steals the scenes as an Australian method actor who manages to eclipse Robert De Niro's famed transformation inRaging Bull.Jack Black (in a nod to Eddie Murphy'sThe Nutty Professor), Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel round out the rest of the main acting troupe. In smaller roles, Nick Nolte portrays the author of the book, Tropic Thunder, which "got" the movie deal (there's an in-joke). Matthew McConaughey appears as Stiller's TiVo-crazed agent and Tom Cruise appears nearly unrecognizable in creepy make-up as the film's producer. Not a single actor displays anything approaching subtlety or sanity.One final warning: skip the DVD extras at your own risk. The viral video for MTV is hilarious.

WARNING: Avoid this book if your children are young enough to believe in Santa. The publisher's lists an appropriate audience of 5-to-8-years old; however a better guide is simply whether or not your child still believes in Santa.Stevie, a smart-aleck kid straight out of a John Hughes movie, is the narrator. He sets the tone on page two:[Last year, I quit believing in Santa. I noticed that our chimney was too skinny for even a chicken to slide down. So when a TV reporter asked me on Christmas Eve if I was watching for Santa, I said, "Are you kidding? Do you really think a 1,700-year old saint on a flying sleigh brings gifts to everyone on earth--all in one night? And he's got elves on the payroll?"]Perhaps author James Solheim had just bought the DVD ofUncle Buckbecause you can substitute Stevie's voice for 8-year old Miles and read the book doing an impersonation of Macaulay Culkin, who spent most of that movie doing an impression of Humphrey Bogart.The book is laced with sarcasm that flies over the heads of the intended audience straight to the X generation. Here's another excerpt: "Then tell me, just how did Saint Nicholas, a guy born before the year 300, get to be head of a twenty-first century charitable organization?"As the father of two boys, ages 6 and 4, I can tell you they don't get that joke.In summary, I can't recommend this book to parents with young children. I recommend these Christmas stories instead:Great Joyby Kate DiCamillo, the Newbery Medal-winning author of The Tale Of Despereaux;Santa Claus the World's Number One Toy Expertby Marla Frazee;Christmas Magicby Sue Stainton; andThe Night Before Christmasby Clement Clarke Moore and illustrated by Douglas W. Gorsline.

Our doctor recommended we add DHA to our 5-year-old son's diet to bolster his immune system and fight allergies. We first purchased Nordic Naturals-DHA Junior Omega-3 Supplement in August 2009 and started giving it to our 7-year-old son as well.Not only have we seen improvement in their immunity but we also witnessed them calming down a bit. We learned that DHA is important for proper growth and development of the brain, eyes, nervous system and cell membranes.Each son takes four soft gels daily with food, according to the suggested use. The chewable soft gels have a strawberry flavor. Neither of our sons has mentioned a "fish" taste and they continue to take the soft gels without complaint.We purchased this along withBuddy Bear Probioticfrom Amazon and have since reordered both supplements. The only complaint is that this product is not available through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Rating: Five stars.

Besides being a great collection of new vocabulary words for young children, this book is just fun to act out. My 5-year old and 4-year old love to mimic the animal sounds -- munching, crunching, sniffing, snooping.The book provides an overview of the different purposes of mouths and noses with lots and lots of close-up photographs of animals. There's nothing scary or gross here (other DK Readers books feature snakes, spiders and bugs).Our sons have many DK Readers books. Please check my Amazon Listmania lists for more recommendations. I have one list for bedtime books and another for superhero books.Here's some other DK Readers science books that I recommend:*DK Readers: Slinky, Scaly Snakes (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: The Secret Life of Trees (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Plants Bite Back!

I have two boys, ages 6 and 4, who love all things creepy and icky. "Plants Bite Back" is a great addition to their book collection.The DK Readers series is a great introduction to science for little kids. The quality, full-color pictures really draw in my sons. We use these books both for regular bedtime reading and to develop our sons' reading skills. What's great about the natural science books from DK Readers is that we can reinforce the vocubulary and learning with real world examples, whether at the zoo, at the park or in our backyard.We've purchased DK Readers books on snakes, spiders, bugs and bacteria. The carnivorous plants in this edition were a perfect fit to their other science books.Here's some other DK Readers science books that I recommend:*DK Readers: Slinky, Scaly Snakes (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Bugs! Bugs! Bugs! (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Munching, Crunching, Sniffing, and Snooping (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: The Secret Life of Trees (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*Micro Monsters: Life Under the Microscope (Paperback)

Our two young boys needed a reminder to wash their hands after using the bathroom, after sneezing and after picking up "things" in the backyard.Lo and behold, we found this little gem from DK readers.Now, our boys understand about germs and use soap and hand sanitizer religiously. We pull the book out periodically to remind them of why good hygiene is so important. The fantastic pictures really help young minds grasp this concept.Here's some other DK Readers science books that I recommend:*DK Readers: Slinky, Scaly Snakes (Level 2: Beginning to Read Alone) (Paperback)*DK Readers: Bugs!

(Level 3: Reading Alone) (Paperback)UPDATE: October 2009Time again to pull this book out for a refresher about good hygiene. All schools are on the lookout for a swine flu outbreak (H1N1 Virus) and the common flu.

Should the game's title not spell it out the stereotypical hillbilly humor clearly enough, allow me to add further details.You drive through Hick State County.You play as Bobbie-Sue, Cletus, Earl, or Rawkus."Ma" Jackson runs the company.We were looking for a simple racing game, willing to overlook the crude theme if the gameplay was fun. Instead, the best words to describe the game are monotonous, boring and annoying.Despite featuring a 3D environment you don't get to see much in driving mode. No doubt this improves on a system featuring a larger screen but that's only part of the problem. The game is split into two types, an economic simulation game where you buy low and sell high, upgrading your truck and picking up tips on where supply and demand are best. This half of the game is simple yet unoriginal.We bought the game for the racing and that turned out to be freewheeling and sloppy. You'll feel more like you're driving a tug boat on ice than a truck in traffic. We quickly grew tired of running down (and running over) other cars, cows and cactus.In summary, there are better options available on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS systems if you're looking for a racing game or an economic simulation. And you won't have to offend Southern culture in the process.And that's the real problem of the game - no real sense of danger. No urgency at all. Wrecking your truck or running out of gas are minor setbacks. Getting chased, pulled over and caught by police results in a minor fine - then they just let you keep on going from where you stopped.

I have two sons, ages 6 and 4, who love to play Mario Kart on the Nintendo DS. They loved the racing scenese in this movie but the dramatic scenes between each race bored them silly.This is a movie aimed at young boys, but perhaps ages 8-10 is the right target. There's just too much soap opera drama stretching this story past the hour and a half mark for younger kids. However, the dazzling special effects are something you don't want to miss.

I've used Salux Nylon bath towels for more than a decade now. I first learned of these in Japan.I've found no other bath towel that is more durable for the price. A single towel usually lasts me 6-9 months.I often travel for business. I can't stand the hotel bath towels that are never long enough to scrub my upper back. Besides that, the towels are too soft to provide any scrubbing power.So, I carry one of these nylon bath towels in a Ziplock bag and keep it in my shaving kit. The towel dries out in about an hour (time for breakfast), then I put it back in the Ziplock bag and I'm ready to go.The towels come in several colors -- blue, pink, yellow -- should that matter to you. The towel is durable, easy to carry, and reasonably priced (buy lots at reduced prices to save on shipping).

My sons (ages 6 and 4) love this new animated series, The Spectacular Spider-Man. The show is much better suited for younger audiences than Spider-Man's last animated series, which lasted only one season on MTV in 2003.This series features all of Spider-Man's most famous villians, including the Green Goblin, Venom, Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Chameleon and Electro.In Volume 2, Peter Parker's ability to tackle an onslaught of menacing super-villains is put to the ultimate test. He must take on the evil likes of some of his most daunting rivals ever -- the Shocker, Sandman and Rhino, all while finding time for his Chemistry lessons.If you absolutely must buy a DVD right now (birthday present, etc.) this is a good choice for Spider-Man fans. Amazon has the DVD priced $5 below suggested retail price ($19.95) and this is a good choice for young children who love Spider-Man.The more economical decision is to wait for a DVD set release of all 26 episodes from Seasons 1 and 2, which should be priced around $30. It was announced earlier this year that Season 2 would move from the CW network to Disney XD. Season 2 is scheduled to begin in March 2009. However, the Spectacular Spider-Man ended production after completing the 26th episode (the end of Season 2). A third season might happen, depending on the ratings Season 2 gets on Disney XD.There are other Spectacular Spider-Man gift options to consider if you hold off on the DVD purchase. Amazon has a great set of action figures modeled that were modeled from the animated series. I recommend the action figures listed below but check out my Amazon lists for other superhero toys and books.One final note on these action figures: we paid about $5 each but many collectors have driven up prices to more than $20 each. Compare Amazon sellers and be selective. You can still find affordable action figures on Amazon but you need to do some research.Spiderman Animated Action Figure - Spider-ManSpiderman Animated Action Figure Black-Suited SpidermanSpiderman Animated Action Figure - Doc OctopusSpiderman Animated Action Figure - VenomSpiderman Animated Action Figure - Green GoblinSpiderman Animated Action Figure - SandmanSpiderman Animated Action Figure - ElectroSpiderman Animated Action Figure - RhinoSpiderman Animated Action Figure - LizardIn summary, I'd rate The Spectacular Spider-Man series four stars based on the entertainment value for young superhero fans. The shows are accessible without being too scary or adult for the under-10 audience. However, by marketing the first season into four DVDs, I deduct three stars. The series is overpriced, especially in light of the current economy.

Warm this sauce up first for a glaze that marries beautifully with pork tenderloin and grilled chicken. More sweet than heat, the mango puree and honey offset the spices.Our first experience with the Fischer & Wieser brand was a bottle ofRazzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce. That sauce is smokier and spicier than the Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce but not as versatile. The Raspberry Chipotle sauce and cream cheese makes a delicious appetizer combination but the berry doesn't match up as well with chicken and pork.Likewise, the Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce didn't match up as well with cream cheese but it works beautifully on grilled and roasted white meats. You can grill a tenderloin over direct heat in less than 10 minutes, allowing another five minutes resting time.The ingredients are: Mango Puree, Sugar, Honey, Apple Cider Vinegar, Ginger, Habanero Peppers, Spices. Personally, I'd prefer this sauce to be a bit hotter but that's a minor (and my only) complaint.Amazon packages six bottles in one shipment. Don't let the order size scare you off. This sauce makes an excellent gift. If you are hosting a dinner or party your guests will be asking for the recipe.In summary, the Fischer & Wieser brand delivers a versatile Latin condiment to your dinner table. The sauce not only marries well with white meats (pork and chicken) but can easily fill in as a dipping sauce for Asian fusion dishes. Rating: Five stars.

I've reviewed several of the Glow-in-the-Dark sticker books from DK Publishing. We picked this one up as part of Amazon's great 4-for-3 promotion.This book provides an affordable way to decorate your child's room. The stickers are high quality and colorful. We chose to use the stickers to decorate our children's room and possessions instead of using it as an activity book. However, as an activity book, this can easily occupy a child's attention for hours if not a full day.If you're looking for something to entertain children too young to watch the movie, The Dark Knight, this book is cheaper than a movie ticket or a DVD purchase and will be enjoyed much longer, too.Here are more sticker books we recommend. These are currently available for Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion.

My sons (ages 9 and 7) recently watched a clip of Michael Jackson performance at the "Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever" TV broadcast (March 25, 1983 for those who watched it 29 years ago). My sons were mesmerized.I purchased the MP3 album and downloaded it to my Amazon cloud drive. I then loaded a Michael Jackson playlist on their MP3 players that also includedThriller, the best-selling album of all time. I'm pleased with both purchases.I'm having a lot of fun experiencing the magic again through my children. Although they were born before Jackson died, they had never experienced his music.This is an excellent value: 18 hit tracks for less than $8. The album savings are $15.23 compared to buying all songs individually. "Billie Jean", "Beat It" and "Thriller" are duplicates from theThrilleralbum. Regardless, with both albums I have 24 songs and only three duplicates for less than $13.Rating: Five stars.BTW: I also recommend signing up for Amazon's Cloud Drive - a great way to buy and store your music.

This is the best Spider-Man book from DK Readers. This is a little advanced for my four-year old and a five-year old who love superheroes. However, we started with the simpler version, Spider-Man: The Amazing Story, from DK Readers. I like this book better.There aren't many comic books they can read and enjoy that are age appropriate. I don't let them watch the recent PG or PG-13 rated movies.The DK Readers books provide a good outlet for their superhero imagination and are regularly mixed into our rotation of bedtime books (you can check out my Amazon Listmania list of bedtime books).Avoid the superhero books that are direct tie-ins to the movies, though. I've found those versions to be of lower quality (see my reviews of the Spider-Man 3 books from DK Readers).

I have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old, who love to play with action figures. With a twisting motion at the waist, this Superman packs a punch. The figure comes with an interlocking set of kryptonite crystals ready for Superman's punch.Regardless how you feel about the movie, Superman Returns, this is a durable, inexpensive and fun action figure. Both of my sons told me to rate this five stars.

My two sons (ages 6 and 4) love picture books at bedtime They also love books with dinosaurs. The book leads off with:...When Rex came to town, everyone looked at his huge head high in the air and at his large sharp teeth. And they screamed, "DINOSAUR! DINOSAUR! RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!" And they did.Accompanied by silly illustrations, the story then introduces an easily-accessable list of idioms such as "The jackhammers hit the road" and "The letuce headed out."A good book for younger children and, perhaps, a useful resource for older children learning about idoms, I give the story a four-star rating. This isn't a classic but it is better than the average picture book.

OK, so these egg/pancake rings aren't exactly cursed but you'd think this product was downright evil after reading some of these reviews.Perhaps, most people are expecting too much. These rings work and respond best to a gentle cooking hand. I've tried eggs and pancakes both and have had great success. The more I use the rings, the more proficient I've become. HERE'S A TIP: You don't want to overfill the rings. Give it a gentle shake to loosen the pancake from the edges before lifting the rings away.I like this product because it allows me to produce pancakes that are PERFECTLY SIZED FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I make a huge batch on Sunday and put enough in the freezer to last the week.BTW: We've owned the rings for more than a year and the NONSTICK SURFACE is holding up well.

First, let me say this game is fun if you are playing on a quality game board with quality playing pieces.Othello is a great game for young children. The rules are easy to learn and this game provides a solid education in basic strategy.However, I set aside my own nostalgia for this game and looked at the reality of what's inside the box.Here's the negatives:This game board is cheap.The poor construction means poor durability; the faux felt is already peeling away from the board.The board is designed so tight that the game pieces almost have to be snapped into place when you flip them.The game pieces are thinner and harder to pick up, especially for older hands (beware grandparents).Steer clear of this version from Mattel. See if you can find a better quality version of the game. It makes a difference.Message to Mattel: I'd rather pay the extra $10-$15 for you to provide better-quality materials. Cheap construction like this makes me think twice about buying your other games.

Aside from elevating my weaponry to one of Bill Murray's (Carl Spackler's) gopher grenades, this is the strongest product I've found on the market to keep varmits off my property.The setting:Several lush, fruit-bearing trees surround our house, including apple, Asian pear and plum. Add to that several rose bushes or, as the deer speak of it, appetizers. Our front yard is dominated by a more-than-50-year-old sweetgum (Liquidambar) tree that produces golf ball-sized, spiny seed pods.The varmits:The sweetgum tree attracts squirrels from six surrounding counties to pilgrimage to our doorstep. I later learned that a group of squirrels is called a `scurry.' I'm quite sure squirrels referred to our front yard as `SCURRYTRAVAGANZA,' sponsored in part by our neighbors, who insist on stuffing low-hanging bird feeders with dried corn, peanuts and black oil sunflower seeds.The family:We have two young boys and two old dogs, so pest control is a challenge. They all touch, dig, sniff and scratch around the house. Thankfully, Deer Off II is recognized and approved by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) and USDA approved for organic gardening. As the company touts, "Because it's EPA registered, parents can feel confident using this product around their children and household pets."The results:The first application ofDeer Off IIdidn't appear to do much (granted, we were a bit antsy, so we applied it again a few days later. An invisible perimeter now surrounds our house. Rose bushes produce roses that bloom rather than magically disappearing in the night. Our sweetgum no longer buzzes with activity like a McDonalds playground on custody weekends.The rating:Five stars. The battery-operated sprayer might appear to be overkill but it sure is handy. I'm thinking the poor results from the first spraying had more to do with my shaky trigger finger and failure to follow instructions (shake product well before using). Thankfully, there are no stiff squirrels or poisoned deer in our yard. The family voiced concerns we'd have to dig a cemetery as though the squirrels might drop out of the tree like rotten apples.No fear. Deer Off II wards away pests, it doesn't kill them.

We have a 5-year old and a 4-year old, so finding games, puzzles and activities that the whole family can enjoy together is very important to us. This floor puzzle is large enough we can all enjoy it together.We own more than 25 jigsaw puzzles, including 4 floor puzzles from Melissa and Doug. This 100-piece puzzle is large, so it is easy for both of our children to handle the pieces.Our kids have learned a lot of vocabulary from this puzzle, too. The sea animals are vivid and bright.Of all the jigsaw puzzles we own, Melissa and Doug puzzles are the most durable.

If your child's idea of enjoying the ocean is eating fish sticks, this book introduces oceanography with the help of Aquaman.We recommend the DK Readers series. Our sons -- ages 5 and 4 -- really enjoy reading about superheroes, so we use that interest to introduce them to other topics (see my listmania list and other reviews).Each of these books offers several graphics on each page. The information is arranged in brief chapters with lots of USA Today-style sidebars.We also have the "I Can Read" books for young readers which we use for bedtime reading. The Level 4 books are more difficult and are better shared a few pages at a time. These make a great spring board for weekend science projects and activities.We also own:Green Lantern's Book of Great InventionsThe Flash's Book of SpeedIncredible Hulk Book of StrengthBatman's Guide to Crime & Detection

After just three weeks of use, our dog no longer has any bladder control issues. This treatment was easy to administer and cheaper than a surgical solution.Our 11-year old female Miniature Schnauzer began to suffer health issues that led to leakage problems. We placed a diaper on our dog each night, an experience that was only occasionally effective as our dog often managed to wiggle herself out of the diaper. The dog had not exhibited bladder control and/or incontinence issues before her health deteriorated. Our veterinarian discovered the dog suffered from small, bladder stones -- he called it `sludge' -- a common health issue with this particular breed and with older, female dogs in general.Given the expense and risk of surgery as a treatment, we explored alternatives. That's how we learned of this product andHomeoPet Leaks No More. We purchased both products through Amazon and followed the directions. Within three weeks, our dog's leaking problems were gone. The dog could sleep through the night without an accident, too.Rating: Five stars.BTW: We resolved our dog's health issues, too. Our veterinarian pulled a couple of her teeth, so she's on a soft food diet for a while but her overall health is much better.

If you are thinking of buying or already have bought a Superman action figure for your child, look elsewhere for a villian action figure. We bought both the Superman and Lex Luthor action figures. Superman gets played with and Lex, well, he's at the bottom of the toy box.The green attachments are poorly designed. The costume is so bulky that if you attempt to move Lex, the Krypto Armor simply begins to fall off the action figure.Here's some good Superman action figures I recommend:1.

Did you ever wonder whatFargowould look like had Frances McDormand and William Macy switched roles? In Burn After Reading, McDormand summons her inner Jerry Lundegaard as Linda, a fitness club worker looking for love via Internet dating. Convinced she needs plastic surgery, Linda sets in motion a scheme to raise the money.The results are comical: people are fired, divorced and some are even murdered. The twists will elicit gasps and giggles. Not unlike other films by Joel and Ethan Coen, we find other characters on parallel tracks: Katie (Tilda Swinton) is cheating on her husband, CIA analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich), with federal marshal Harry (George Clooney), who instead finds Linda.I'd be remiss to leave out Linda's co-worker, Chad (Brad Pitt), a fitness trainer whose espionage training perhaps comes entirely from watchingMission Impossiblereruns.Critics will likely point toThe Big LebowskiandFargoperhaps expecting fans will make comparisons and toss out Burn After Reading. Instead, fans of the Coen Brothers will lovingly seat this crime tale as they would an odd relative at the Thanksgiving table. There's plenty of room for everyone.I give Burn After Reading four stars, although I suspect this movie, like The Big Lebowski and Fargo, will grow on me even more with time.

Certified organic and 100% natural flavors are nice but do they taste good? No, these lollipops taste G-R-E-A-T!My sons, ages 6 and 5, like the sour flavors - Sour Apple Tart, Pomegranate Pucker - while my wife prefers Mango Tango, Strawberry Smash and Very Very Cherry. Me? I like them all, and at 22 calories and less than 10 cents each, I can enjoy a YummyEarth lollipop every day as an afternoon treat without worrying about my diet or my wallet.My wife has shared these lollipops with a friend whose daughter is on a strict diet that avoids artificial colorings. YummyEarth lollipops are allergen-free; gluten-free; wheat-free; GMO-free; soy-free; nut-free; dairy-free with no chemical dyes. Even if you don't have allergies or special dietary needs, these will quickly become your favorite lollipops.After reading other reviews, I want to address the complaints about the distribution of flavors. Our shipment arrived as pictured, a plastic bin with 150 assorted lollipops. Yes, there are more of some flavors than others but that is the trade-off. You can order individual flavors on Amazon but the price per lollipop is higher than the assorted bins.In summary, YummyEarth lollipops are a tasty, guilt-free treat for everyone and a real blessing for parents with children on restrictive diets.UPDATE: These make great gifts for co-workers and for Halloween, too!

Most people will skip this Finnish holiday film, dubbed in English, searching for something more familiar, something less challenging. That's a mistake.This is an excellent family film about the origin of Santa Claus. This film transcends the commercial image of Santa and grounds him in a loving story that isn't afraid to make you cry.The word "classic" is used too often to describe holiday films, each of lesser and lesser quality. Hollywood has a lousy record when it comes to holiday films over the past decade. For example,The Santa Clause 3 The Escape Clause(2006),Deck the Halls(2006),Christmas With the Kranks(2004),Surviving Christmas(2004), and, most recently,Santa Baby(2007) andFour Christmases(2008). And that doesn't count other holiday lumps of coal starring Tom Arnold, Kelsey Grammer and Matthew McConaughey.My point is that this film, with its snowy lush cinematography and original storyline, isn't without its flaws. However, you will come away feeling inspired by the result, rather than feeling cheated once again by another made-for-TV plot, lame acting and sophomoric humor.Jen Johans' review for Film Intuition does an excellent job of capturing what makes this foreign film so special. The following excerpt nicely sums up why you should give the movie a chance:"However, despite its melancholic opener and general audience reluctance to foreign films, this uplifting PG-rated movie is one I urge parents to seek out to offer a new alternative to the primarily commercial approach of Santa Claus movies."A beautiful work filled with the ingredients that make our classics including A Christmas Carol, Nutcracker and other holiday movies so endearing, director Juha Wuolijoki's Story also garnered prestigious accolades in time for its DVD debut including a seal of approval by The Dove Foundation and an All-Star honor by the well-respected Kids First! Coalition for Quality Children's Media."Rating: Four stars.

My four-year old picked out this book for bedtime reading. This is a nice change of pace from the usual fare (snakes, dinosaurs and pirates) he and his six-year old brother enjoy.The prologue to the story asks, "Why Do We Celebrate Valentine's Day?" You don't necessarily need to read this to your child but should they ask why people give valentines to each other the page sums it up nicely.A young panda makes lots of valentines and hides them around the house for mommy, daddy, baby, the family dog, and sends one off in the mail to grandma. The rhyming verse is light and soothing, perfect for bedtime reading.One heart in an envelope--Mail it far away.Cut out lotsof valentines.Hey, look!A heart bouquet!The last page of the book offers a nice bonus, easy-to-follow instructions for making and decorating your own paper hearts.Illustrator Dorothy Donohue brings the panda family to life using layers of colored paper. The effect is surprisingly soft for paper collages. Once your child masters making paper hearts they probably will try and recreate many of the illustrations.In summary, while not a classic children's picture book it offers much of what you're looking for at bedtime. The clever theme and opportunity for children to learn how to make valentines makes this book a keeper. Rating: 4 stars.

I have two sons, ages 6 and 4, who are die-hard superhero fans. I grabbed this game during a sale, thinking Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash...wow! All these superheroes in one game!Well, all of those superheroes don't really matter when the gameplay is monotonous beat-'em-up. I was hoping for something along the lines of theFantastic Fourtitle on the Game Boy Advance, where each superhero has distinct skills and abilities. Batman and Superman -- and Wonder Woman! for that matter -- shouldn't be interchangable but that's the case here.I've read that the Playstation 2 version of Justice League Heroes was more enjoyable and that's the direction I'd point you in should you also own that console. For Nintendo DS players, I recommend you pick up a Game Boy Advance copy ofJustice League Heroes: The Flashor wait until a better DC superhero game is released on the Nintendo DSIn the meantime, check out my Amazon Listmania Lists of Nintendo DS games for young boys.

This DVD is a bummer if you were hoping the animated version would be more kid-friendly than The Dark Knight movie. Sadly, this DVD is not appropriate for little Batman-fans.Surprisingly, the DVD isn't that great for adults either. I'll preface by saying I liked The Dark Knight movie, despite the fact that it was the darkest detective story I'd seen since "Seven."The mishmash of stories and directors in the DVD Batman Gotham Knight failed to engage me because there's no coherent transition from one short story to another. In fact, it never became clear how these stories bridge the two Batman movies (Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). The marketing campaign for this DVD claimed that it would fill in the gaps between the two movies.Anime fans will like to see Batman illustrated in new and interesting ways. And trust me some of the art is very, very good. However, there's just not enough story here to engage most adults. None of the short stories lived up to the episosde "Legends of the Dark Knight" from Batman Gotham Knights (a.k.a. The New Batman Adventures) produced in 1998.If you are shopping for young kids, save yourself some money and skip this edition in favor one of the other choices in my Amazon Listmania List, "Young boys' Batman/Dark Knight entertainment."

How fast is fast? The Flash acts as a guide to the fastest people, machines and animals on Earth.We recommend the DK Readers series. Our sons -- ages 5 and 4 -- really enjoy reading about superheroes, so we use that interest to introduce them to other topics (see my listmania list and other reviews).Each of these books offers several graphics on each page. The information is arranged in brief chapters with lots of USA Today-style sidebars.We also have the "I Can Read" books for young readers which we use for bedtime reading. The Level 4 books are more difficult and are better shared a few pages at a time. These make a great spring board for weekend science projects and activities.We also own:Green Lantern's Book of Great InventionsAquaman's Guide to the OceanIncredible Hulk Book of StrengthBatman's Guide to Crime & Detection

Lipton Green Tea To Go packs are handy when at home, at the office and when you're on the road and want to avoid drinking your calories.The packages are easy to carry and I keep a box at my office and several packets in my glove box. I've reviewed several of the Lipton and Crystal Light products.I like the ice teas best. Lipton's teas are less sweet, more adult-tasting than Crystal Light's mixes. Both are a nice change of pace from drinking plain water and I've found that I enjoy it best when it is slushy cold.Here's my recipe for a perfect drink: I add the drink mix packet to myRubbermaid Chug Bottle, an inexpensive water bottle perfect for Crystal Light and Lipton packets. Then, I add 12 oz of water and fill the rest of the bottle with crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking I've got an ice-cold drink.Bottom line: You want to avoid the soda machine and save money by skipping bottled teas. These drink mixes are handy at home, at the office and on the road - anywhere you want to avoid drinking your calories.Crystal Light On the Go, Peach TeaCrystal Light Raspberry Lemonade On-The-GoLipton White Tea Iced Tea Mix To-Go, RaspberryLipton Green Tea To Go, Mandarin and MangoCrystal Light On the Go, Raspberry IceCrystal Light On-the-Go Live Active Natural Mixed Berry

Through the work week, breakfast is perfunctory with oatmeal just another option among cereal bars and yogurt. We've stocked various brands of instant oatmeal but Quaker Oatmeal Express best balances our desires for tasty and healthy. Our sons - ages 6 and 4 - enjoy the different flavors. My wife likes the individual cups, which make clean-up a breeze.Quaker Oatmeal Express is office-friendly, too. You can prepare the oatmeal with hot water or a microwave. Either way, you've got a no-mess breakfast in less than two minutes. Again, the individual cups are great for a portable option much healthier than anything you'll find on a fast food drive-thru menu.We've purchased three Quaker Oatmeal Express flavors,Cinnamon Roll,Golden Brown SugarandBaked Apple. All three are not overly sweet. The Baked Apple flavor has a slight fiber edge (1 g) over the other flavors.In summary, skip the sausage egg biscuit and pick up this healthier breakfast option instead. (Studies have found that oatmeal is more filling than dry cereal with the same calories and fiber content.) Quaker Oatmeal Express is healthy, portable and makes clean-up easy.One caveat: if time is not a consideration, the best oatmeal you can buy on Amazon isMcCANN'S Steel Cut Oatmeal. We purchase it through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. This is our Sunday-morning-family-breakfast oatmeal. We add frozen berries, or a tablespoon of brown sugar and an ounce of Drambuie to the cooking pot. The texture and nutty flavor of McCann's oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced.

We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old.We have the entire set, all six volumes. Our kids love these DVDs.I like them because the absence of dialogue forces our children to figure out the storyline. I also like the fact that the humor is family-friendly and that I don't have to suffer through an hour of "I wants" after a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.If you have young children, this is a great buy. The individual stories run about 5-8 minutes each, so you can moderate how much they watch without having to commit to a 90-minute Disney movie.There are three sets of DVDs, each two volumes in length. The double sets are better priced than buying each volume individually.

I purchased this in June 2007 for my office. I wanted to cut down on feeding one-dollar bills into the vending machines in the office break room and bring my own lunch and snacks to work.This refrigerator is great! It runs quietly (right behind my desk!). I've defrosted it once and wiped it clean twice (I ran the cold setting too high and split open a can).I ran into the same problems other customers mention about the shipping. My refrigerator arrived with a crease in the lower right-hand corner. I called Amazon and they deducted a portion of my costs (I was given the option of sending it back, but the dent didn't affect the operation).Anyway, one year later, I'm thrilled with my purchase. Amazon's customer service was fantastic, too. That's why, even with the dent, I'm giving this product 5 STARS.

Nostalgia is a fair reason to buy this DVD but don't be shocked if the cheesy stock footage fails to charm your children. Filmation Adventures hasn't aged well.Why is there such nostalgia for this series? Well, until Filmation came along the DC animated universe consisted of only Superman and Batman. No one had drawn animated versions of The Flash, The Atom, Hawkman, Green Lantern as well as the Teen Titans and Justice League of America.Produced in the late 1960s, the Filmation Adventures reflect more of a 1950s "us-versus-them" theme when superheroes fought Communist metaphors instead of domestic threats to society. The episodes set superheroes against aliens, monster bugs and, well... more and more monster alien bugs. Despite the fact that you see the first appearances of many DC superheroes, the series is devoid of many, classic DC Comics villians, including Lex Luthor, Brainiac, the Riddler, Black Manta, Sinestro and Captain Cold.My sons (ages 8 and 6) didn't findDC Super Heroes: The Filmation Adventuresinteresting. It wasn't the age of the series that was the problem (they enjoy the original Jonny Quest cartoons on Boomerang); they were turned off by the choppy editing as well as the goofy villains and repetitive storylines. Younger generations have far better options from which to choose, including:*Justice League: The Complete Series*Batman: The Animated Series*Superman: The Complete Animated Series*Teen Titans - The Complete First Season*Batman: The Brave and the Bold

I answered more why questions at the end of the book than received "What's that?" questions during the reading. That's a good sign my sons didn't connect with the storyline and weren't engaged by the illustrations.We have several other Thomas books that were regulars in our bedtime reading collection. I say "were" because my sons are now 5-years old and 4-years old and both are a little too old for these picture books. Aim to read these with your 2-3-year olds.I recommend these Thomas books instead: "A Cow on the Line" and "New Tracks for Thomas."

The book contains four stories:When Mole Lost His GlassesWhen Mole Wouldn't Zip His JacketWhy Mole ShoutedWhy Mole Asked WhyWe expected at least one story to stand out. That didn't happen. In fact, the book survived only a single bedtime reading with my sons, ages 6 and 4. By the time we reached the final story, the only enjoyment they derived from the book was seeing how many times the word "mole" appeared.The first story (When Mole Lost His Glasses) was what drew me to the book in the first place since my youngest son wears glasses. I'd hoped for a lesson on self responsibility but instead got a meandering (two chapters!) story that ended like this:"Here you are," said Grandmother Mole. "I've fixed them."Mole put on his glasses and kissed his grandmother and said, "You are my good Grandmother Mole.""And you are my dear Mole," said Grandmother Mole, "even if you're never going to remember to put anything back where it belongs."We cannot recommend this book. If you are looking for an early reader book or a bedtime story for young children that features animals, try Arnold Lobel'sFrog and Toadseries orOwl at Home; or Elsa Holmelund Minarik'sLittle Bear; and, naturally, A.A. Milne's original series ofWinnie-the-Poohbooks.

Director Ed Harris plays Virgil Cole, who with Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen, aptly filling the partner role that evokes Sam Elliott inTombstone), signs on to protect Appaloosa from requisite bad guy, Randall Bragg. Jeremy Irons tempers himself as Bragg, a murderous power broker who dabbles in ranching, mining, hotels and other ventures.Naturally, the movie draws comparisons toLonesome Dovebut that reflects the ease and comfort of the Harris-Mortensen partnership. The movie is closer toThe PropositionorDeadwoodthan3:10 to Yuma.Clocking in at 115 minutes, Appaloosa could benefit by restoring several deleted scenes (Harris has said he intends this if a director's cut is released) without the risk of exceeding the run time ofThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford(160 minutes). Both westerns are essentially character studies peppered with flashes of action but the latter film benefitted from Roger Deakins' luscious cinematography. To be fair, Appaloosa cinematographer Dean Semler, working on a tighter budget and film, creates a dusty, gritty landscape that matches the story's throwback style.To its advantage, Appaloosa has moments of humor that sets it apart from other contemporary Westerns. The story is based on Robert B. Parker's novel of the same name. Parker is best known for his Spenser books that later became the TV seriesSpenser: For Hire. The witty banter between Harris and Mortensen is toned down compared with Spenser but you get the sense Robert Urich and Avery Brooks shared similar dialogue.Another plus is the depth of quality character actors - James Gammon, Timothy Spall, Lance Henriksen and Tom Bower to name a few. Although, there's one casting flaw that nearly derails the entire film: Renee Zellweger as Allison French. I might dwell on Zellweger's lack of chemistry with Harris or her come-and-go southern accent but neither flaw distracts as much as her face.I don't know what happened to Zellweger, voted by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 2001. She appears here with angry eyebrows rising at 45 angles from the bridge of her nose, her eyes are squinty and dull, squeezed together by blotchy cheeks and a cr&egrave;me-filled forehead that rivals Nicole Kidman's Botox brow. About 10 minutes into the movie I realized where I'd seen that face before --Jeff Dunham's puppet, Walter.In summary, Appaloosa isn't a classic likeUnforgivenbut it is solid, a throwback genre fans should enjoy.

I like cookbooks that explain how to do the basics well, how to make the most of leftovers and how to substitute ingredients when my cupboard is bare.More often than not, these cookbooks inject a bunch of specialty ingredients I wouldn't normally stock or couldn't find at a local supermarket if my life depended on it.This book is a fair resource for beginners. Consider it a starting point. You'll develop your own stable of recipes and probably ignore the other 80% of the recipes in this book. That doesn't mean this isn't worth purchasing though, especially if you haven't used a slow cooker before.

I started reading this to my sons when they were still in diapers. I would hold them in my arms and rock them gently as I read the book.Now, my sons weigh about 35 pounds each and I'd be begging for a neck brace if I tried that again. So, instead, I've reintroduced the book as an early reader to my 5-year old and 4-year old during bedtime. They read the book to me and we talk about life on the farm and all the responsibilities a farmer has to his family.The gentle story still works (you can't read page after page of rock-a-bye and yawning without it having a similar effect).

Here's a great superhero costume for Halloween. My son didn't want to be another Spider-Man, Superman or Batman. He wanted something unique, so we searched around and found costumes from the Justice League -- Green Lantern, The Flash and Wonder Woman. Well, he chose the Green Lantern because he didn't want his head covered with The Flash's mask.We also picked up theGreen Lantern Flashing Ringto complete the costume. He's tried the costume out and is excited for Halloween.UPDATE: The costume worked out fantastic! An added bonus is that the long sleeves and the muscle build kept our son warm during the Halloween trick or treating, too.Looking for some other great Green Lantern items for kids?Action figure:DC Universe Classics Series 3 Action Figure Hal Jordan (Green Lantern)DVD cartoon:DC Super Heroes: The Filmation AdventuresEarly Reader Book:Green Lantern's Book of Great Inventions (DK READERS)Sticker book:Justice League: Ultimate Sticker BookT-shirt: Green Lantern Logo T-Shirt

Alexandra Wentworth stars as Dr. Elizabeth Goode, an L.A. psychiatrist who specializes in treating (read: abusing) celebrities. The concept looked good as there's plenty of room for guest stars, topical humor and the iconic strangeness of all things Hollywood.I didn't laugh much during the first couple episodes (Steve Landesberg is woefully underused here as Dr. Myron Finklestein), hoping the series would find a toehold. It never happened.Like an out-of-control carousel, Dr. Goode cycles through a series of gags:1. Dr. Goode interrupts the sessions with her own personal problems;2. The celebrity feigns shock and surprise at Dr. Goode's behavior;3. Dr. Goode attempts to place the fault back on the celebrity;4. Dr. Goode offers bad advice (and later spins it or denies it flatly).Wentworth screeches through each episode using those four steps and an increasingly bizarre cast of celebrities who play themselves as needy, neurotic or nihilistic (sometimes, a bit of all three).I can only imagine she made a wager with Larry David that she could create a character more grating than his own inCurb Your Enthusiasm. Hint: she won.

My 5-year old and 4-year old boys really like frogs. This is our second frog book for our bedtime reading collection. Our first book was "The Icky Sticky Frog" by John Lescroart (see my reviews) which I bought along with two "Frog Zoo Light Carabiner with Sound" (available here on Amazon).We've enjoyed "The Icky Sticky Frog" for months now, so when I found "Too Many Frogs" I thought it would be a nice addition. It has been a great addition."Too Many Frogs" is a deeper story, focusing on Rabbit and his structured lifestyle that is disrupted by a visiting frog. I really appreciated the fact that the story reinforces the value of reading and sharing. "The Icky Sticky Frog" is a great picture book that introduces lyrical rhymes for young children. "Too Many Frogs" is better for older children starting to read.By the way, the carabiner lights are great for bedtime reading. You pull back the frog's head and they croak and shine a light from their mouth.

Please read my Amazon review of Batman - The Animated Series, Volume One.I have two boys (a 5 year old and a 4 year old). They are too young to watch the Batman movies -- Batman Begins and The Dark Knight -- but that doesn't stop them from being die-hard fans of the Caped Crusader.Of course, these DVD collections are popular with older fans but young children can enjoy them, too.There are a few scary scenes but nothing on par with what you'd find in the PG-13 rated movies. I recommend that you watch the cartoons along with your children and discuss it with them. I've found that I can reinforce Batman's good behaviors and point out what makes villians bad.

"Peach & Blue" is unusual not only because of the odd pairing but also because it addresses aspirations, kindness, love and death. Had someone described it to me that way I'd have thought it a bit portentous for a bedtime book, especially considering the youth of my audience (my sons are ages six and four). I might even have returned this book to the shelf and looked instead for lighter reading.That would've been a mistake.We meet a blue-bellied toad named Blue and a peach named Peach, who realizes she's approaching the end of her life but wants desperately to see more than the end of the branch from which she hangs, awaiting to be "made into a cobbler or a tart." With Blue's help, Peach does see more of the world and, through her eyes, Blue comes to appreciate what he hadn't seen before.The solicitude of Blue and his friends at the pond is inspirational. There's no terror here, no contrived tension. The other creatures, including a majestic kingfisher, lend a hand to fulfill Peach's wishes."Peach & Blue" is complemented by beautiful illustrations that are surprisingly accurate. The paintings are lush and richly soothing (a pediatrician might consider framing them in her office).When we reached the end of the book, my youngest son reached out to touch the page, asking me if Peach would die soon. I replied yes, that she couldn't live long after separating from her tree. "It is nice that Blue stays with her," he said. "It makes her feel better."Tears rose beneath my eyes. I kissed them both goodnight and turned off the light.This story was a joy to share with my sons and is an experience I highly recommend for your children. "Peach & Blue" rates five stars.BTW: Before last Christmas, we readGreat Joyby Kate DiCamillo, the Newbery Medal-winning author ofThe Tale Of DespereauxandAn Orange for Frankieby Patricia Polacco. I recommend both of these heartwarming books for young children, too.

I'm not a doctor and I don't have a medical condition where I need to use this product regularly. But if I get a cold and chest congestion this is the product I use.I swear by this product and recommend it to everyone who suffers from heavy phlegm when they get sick. You really need to drink water when you take this. I made the mistake of going light on the water one time and had a hard time coughing up the phlegm.More than anything else this product allows me to sleep a full night without having to get up for a second dosage.

Currently, this is the only version of Nobody's Fool available on DVD. The fact that you get a Paul Newman doubleheader for the same price as a single title is just a bonus.Nobody's Fool is one of my favorite dramas and one of Newman's last great roles, as down-on-his luck Sully. The entire cast shines; arguably, this is the best work you've ever seen from Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis. Add to that a young, pre-Oscar-award-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jessica Tandy's final role and you've got a must see film and a treasure to own.I like Richard Russo's books. I'm fond ofMohawk,Nobody's Fooland the Pulitzer Prize-winningEmpire Falls. The latter book was translated into an HBO miniseries,Empire Falls, which surprisingly also includes performances by Paul Newman and Philip Seymour Hoffman. However,Newman won only one Oscar, Best Actor for his role inThe Color of Moneyin 1986. However, Newman exudes such casual charm as Sully in Nobody's Fool that it remains my favorite of the two. Rating: Five stars.P.S. I'm not a big fan of "Fat Man & Little Boy". Unlike Nobody's Fool, the historical drama doesn't have the charm and humor I prefer for repeated viewings.

We received this game as a gift for our two sons -- ages 5 and 4. Our family has played this game regularly for months now and we enjoy it.Positives:The game is easy for young children to learn.The game is easy to set up.The game is relatively fast (expect to finish a 4-player game in less than 20 minutes).Negatives:The cardboard boxes used to hold the "food" isn't as durable as they should be for a game intended for children. Plastic would've been better.The game doesn't expand beyond the book.If you've checked my other board game reviews, you'll know I like games that "grow" with children. This game doesn't do that, however this game is a good starter, a game that really suits children ages 3-4 who are just learning to play group board games.

This book is another great addition to the Little Bear series (see my other reviews). Father Bear goes on a fishing trip and his Little Bear wonders what he may catch...an octopus, a whale, maybe a mermaid.Perfect for young readers and a great bedtime book (with four interwoven stories inside, so you can stop if your audience gets sleepy).My sons can relate to Little Bear and his imagination. The stories are easier to follow yet entertaining enough to support multiple readings.

I read bedtime books with my two sons, ages 6 and 4 ("I'll be five soon," he reminds me.) Although this book doesn't make as regular an appearance in our bedtime reading schedule as say Dr. Suess books, the Stinky Cheese Man always produces giggles.My kids are too young to know all of the fairy tales this book shreds in the name of parody. That's OK. This book will make a great early reader, too.For now, I provide the Stinky Cheese Man with a high-pitched, pseudo-Spongebob Squarepants voice and read the text as "fast as I can." The result: I've got a happy audience at bedtime. Rating: Four stars.Update: I've also reviewed Jon Scieska'sKnucklehead: Tall Tales and Almost True Stories of Growing up Scieszka, which I recommend to the parents of young boys.

Based in Michigan in the early 1900s, the story begins with the Stowell family eagerly awaiting their father's return from Lansing, where he's picking up a box of Florida oranges, a family Christmas tradition. Ten-year old Frankie Stowell's Christmas excitement results in two major events, both centered in the spirit of giving.I hesitate to share more plot details as it would spoil the story's magic. My two sons, ages 6 and 4, enjoyed my bedtime reading. They understood the story's messages of charity and family love and easily related to Frankie's curiosity. The Stowell family's Christmas tradition - adorning their mantle with evergreens and oranges - has also inspired our sons' holiday decorating plans.In summary, this is a touching family story that I recommend you share with your children during the holidays. This Stowell family will remind you of the Ingalls family's classic stories inLittle House in the Big WoodsandLittle House on the Prairie.

My two sons (ages 5 and 4) have enjoyed this book for the last two years. While there isn't much text, the illustrations are so playful that we can't help but read the book as a three-person bedtime performance.I can't speak for what little girls find funny but little boys find nothing more humorous than a gorilla climbing into bed.There comes a point in the story when the zookeeper's wife turns off the light and tells her husband, "good night." The next page is pitch black filled with voice balloons from the zoo animals answering "good night." My sons love to read this part, using different animal voices.In summary, this bedtime book is a sketch on stage. The more you and your kids add to the performance, the more fun you'll all have with the book.

My two sons, ages 6 and 4, helped me pick out this bedtime story book because they both love bears. Beginning December 1, Snowbear and his animal friends, Charlie the penguin, Ray the squirrel, Harry the raccoon and Tom the rabbit prepare for Christmas.What I like most about the book is that many of the activities, such as making ornaments or hanging a wreath, mirror what my sons have planned for December.Here's another example that illustrates a lot can happen in 25 days, including an unplanned event: "On the 13th day he went sledding down the giant hill near his house. On the 14th day he caught a cold and had to stay in bed. On the 15th day he watched his favorite holiday movies and snuggled under the blankets."In summary, if your child loves bears this is a good Christmas story to add to your bedtime story collection. Snowbear's Christmas Countdown is more charming thanBear Stays Up for Christmas, a pale sequel to the originalBear Snores On.

My sons have two Mr. Freeze action figures. This one is a newer design from "The Batman" animated TV show. If you can find one for the right price, it is worth adding to your kids' action figure collection.The "Batman Mission Masters 4 Rocket Blast Mr. Freeze Action Figure" by Hasbro is more fun than this version. I've reviewed both action figures, which are in a list of Batman/Dark Knight action figures for young boys.My kids play with this Mr. Freeze because it looks like the character on the TV show, but they like the gadgets the other version offers and play with that action figure more.

We enjoyed this DVD, the fourth superhero movie we've watched this summer -- Iron Man, Hellboy II, and The Dark Knight being the others. We liked all of the movies but the Incredible Hulk was the only one we didn't get to see in the theater.This version was a much better action film than the last Hulk movie, which we thought played more like a Sci-Fi soap opera. There's plenty of action, although not quite as much as in the Bourne films and the latest 007 film. This movie benefits from a better cast. Edward Norton's portrayal of tortured soul Bruce Banner plays well against the ruthless team of General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and Special Forces Officer Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).Again, parents shouldn't share this with young children. The movie is rated PG-13 because of the violence and language. I wish there was a good, animated Hulk movie to recommend but there isn't one available now. Also, please avoid the new Avengers animated DVDs. I made the mistake of picking these up without checking the ratings -- they feature the Hulk, but the stories and the language are not for young children either.If you're looking for better choices for your little superhero fan, check out my Amazon Listmania List, "Batman / Dark Knight entertainment for little boys" and have fun!

Vince Vaughn is at his comedic best when he's jiving, conning and indulging himself on screen, whether as Jeremy inWedding Crashersor Trent inSwingersor Ricky inMade. Vince hasn't yet found the Christmas movie to showcase his skills. You won't find it here in Fred Claus or in the 2008 holiday release, Four Christmases.Fred Claus is stocked with an all-star team of actors, including three Academy Award winners - Kevin Spacey as the villainous efficiency expert Clyde Northcutt, Rachel Weisz as Vaughn's girlfriend and Kathy Bates as his mother. Paul Giamatti co-stars as the younger brother, Santa Claus and Miranda Richardson portrays Mrs. Claus.However, the deep cast is wasted with a thin script that neither digs into the darker elements of sibling rivalry nor settles on its main audience. Too often, the reach is for children (dancing and chase scenes) at the expense of adults' interest.The premise was ripe for a raunchy adult comedy in the vein ofBad SantaorNational Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Instead, this sappy story (will Santa's workshop close down?!?) joins the holiday-themed wasteland alongsideJingle All the Way,Deck the HallsandMixed Nuts.I can only assume director David Dobkin was tied and gagged during filming. That's the only way to explain how he followedWedding Crasherswith this lightweight comedy.Do yourself a favor this holiday season. Skip Fred Claus and instead pick upA Christmas Storystarring Peter Billingsley.

The Firefly is a new villian from "The Batman" animated TV show. What makes this action figure so fun to play with is the backpack that fires sparks (don't worry -- it is perfectly safe)!This is a fully articulated action figure by Mattel. Don't purchase the collector's version. You can find affordable versions at a better price that are intended for kids to play with rather than stack up in a glass case.

We've had this action figure for more than a year now and my sons bring it out when Batman faces Mr. Freeze. The action figure is in great shape considering the amount of abuse it takes.Keep an eye out on all the attachments -- we use Ziploc baggies to store all the extras that come with action figures like this one.This isn't a "must" buy, but if you can pick it up for a reasonable price, it will make a great addition to your child's Batman collection.

We have two boys, a 5-year old and a 4-year old. They love these DVDs.I like them because the absence of dialogue forces our children to figure out the storyline. I also like the fact that the humor is family-friendly and that I don't have to suffer through an hour of "I wants" after a Saturday morning cartoon fest chock full of commercials.If you have young children, this is a great buy. The individual stories run about 5-8 minutes each, so you can moderate how much they watch without having to commit to a 90-minute Disney movie.

The cover on my last issue featured Sofia Vergara in Agent Provocateur's black lingerie - and I still didn't bother to renew my subscription. It was too little, too late for a magazine that initially drew my interest as I smarter alternative toMaximand a more coffee-table friendly alternative toPlayboy. Alas, after a one-year subscription, Esquire failed to capture me.I purchased my Esquire subscription with the same expectations I had forGQ, magazines known more for their abundant advertisements and cologne samples than for an unique, interesting take on men's interests. Esquire pushes well beyond my limits. The April 2012 edition (my last) makes a perfect example. The table of contents appears on page 25; advertisements packed between it and the cover:BvlgariGiorgio ArmaniErmenegildo ZegnaDolce & GabbanaCalvin KleinWoodford ReserveLincs DC & CoNewport Beach Film FestivalHugo BossLuminoxMoontower Comedy & Oddity FestBuickThat's 24 pages of advertisements before you reach the first editorial copy. And if you think that's an unfair representation, let me share that the next 20 pages includes ads for JC Penny, Tommy Hilfiger, Triumph, Canali, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ford, Breitling, Hickey Freeman, Gucci and Citibank. Within the next 20 pages, there are two more pages thinly spread with a table of contents, a staff listing, and only four pages of content, one of which carries the staff listing jump.So, in the first 45 pages of Esquire, there are less than four pages of actual content.Only one article, "Miracle" by Craig Davidson, was of the quality that I'd come to expect from Esquire. The nine-page piece (two pages serve as bloated title art) explores the medical advancements of synthetic hormones to delay age-related conditions.The Sofia Vergara cover garners two thumbs up from me. However, only three more pictures of her appear in the magazine. Three! That's reason enough to fire an editor, maybe a couple. I can only take so many pictures of shaggy, bearded, brooding men hawking shoes, watches and cologne. If you are going to put Sofia Vergara on the cover, at least have the decency to treat your readers to a longer layout, at least a half dozen pages.What's left is a choppy, increasingly juvenile collection of short articles and humor that illustrates how much Maxim and the other Laddies infected the entire men's magazine industry. The April 2012 edition included these one-page, puddle skippers:Levi's made and craftedMad Men's fifth seasonNew books by Stephen King and John GrishamHow picky are sperm banks?Keyboard shortcuts we needIn summary, Esquire is at the 1977 Elvis stage of life. I look back on the old issues with the same fondness I once held for Men's Health, Playboy and GQ. For a magazine approaching its 80th anniversary, Esquire needs some of those synthetic hormones to ward off its bloated visage and marked decline in quality features. Someone forgot being entertaining and smart are not mutually exclusive. Simply, today's Esquire is shallow and Maxim-esque.Rating: Two stars.

Our five-year old and four-year old superhero fans won't be watching the PG and PG-13 movies released this summer -- The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man and The Dark Knight (Batman). What can a parent do for little superheroes looking for some wholesome yet exciting action?This two-volume collection, Challenge of the Super Friends, brings back the fun, simple stories that used to fill Saturday cartoon mornings. Parents can rest easy that heroes and villians are clearly identified. The messages are simple, good triumphs over evil.Kids over 10 probably won't be as entertained by the simple stories and animation. However, this collection suits well for parents looking for something relatively safe to entertain younger children.

We've owned this teapot for more than two years and use it 2-3 times per week for our evening tea.The size is perfect for two cups of tea. The teapot is sturdy and hasn't presented any problems or defects. Green tea leaves are harder to clean from the infuser but there are no other negatives to report.Simple. Efficient. A good value. 5 stars.
