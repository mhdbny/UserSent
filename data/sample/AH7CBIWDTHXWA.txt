The latest thing in nonfiction seems to be narrative tales of projects -- Reading through the encyclopedia, climbing Mt. Everest, cooking your way through Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." Whatever you dream up, chances are someone's already done it -- and written a blog about it. Here, Julie Powell, a hapless 20-something secretary in NYC, looks for -- and finds -- meaning amidst the pages of the first volume of Childs' tome. An entertaining read, but I get the feeling the actual blog was more entertaining the first time around.

There is so much to recommend this book -- a unique, unexplored topic, great writing, realistic characters. The story of Faith, a seven-year-old who suddenly seems to be talking with God and working miracles, keeps readers enthralled as we attempt to figure out if she's the real thing or a charlatan. But as with several of Picoult's books, there are glaring holes in the plot that beg to be poked at and prodded. While I'm willing to suspend disbelief in favor of a great tale, I'm only wililng to go so far, especially if the writer wants me to get lost in the story.A few examples: The idea that Ian would risk so much to hide his brother is ludicrous, as is the thought that a judge would bar a mother from her critically ill child. As is the thought that even if she were barred, any mother on this earth would be camped outside the hospital door, or no further than the cafeteria... And I have to say that I didn't particularly even like Mariah for the first half of the book, as she was too self-absorbed and pitiful for me to spend much time or energy on.I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this novel had the potential to be a real masterpiece, a la Donna Tartt's The Secret History or The Little Friend, but instead lost much credibility by not paying attention to the details.

If I could give this book more than five stars, I would. Stacy Julian takes the "big picture" view and moves away from worrying about what color embossing ink to use on the page, and reminds readers that scrapbooking is, first and foremost, about capturing your family's memories. In her wonderfully warm style, she leads you through design, inspiration, organization, and more. Like no other scrapbooking book on the market -- don't miss it!

This novel -- promoted as a "coming-of-age" story of a midwestern girl in an east coast boarding school -- could have been fabulous. It's obvious that the author can write, and she has some great insights into human nature of the teenage kind. But the overall storyline was disjointed, the main character wishy-washy and unappealing, and the sex gratuitous. Too much started to go on while nothing of any real substance happened. Lots of observations about the school and students, but the main character, Lee, was somehow unable to turn that same insight to herself. I found her unbelievable, and, frankly, unlikeable. A dull read -- like slogging through a slush-filled New England February.

If you reach for a Tess Gerritsen novel, you know what you're going to get -- a psychological thriller cloaked in enough medical terminology to have you sounding like an ER doc, with some graphic blood-and-guts scenes thrown in for good measure. While Gerritsen's books are not for the faint of heart, they are well-plotted and well-written, with strong characters and plenty of action. Because they're all written from that recipe, they do tend to run together, and "Life Support" is another one that fits that bill. The storyline involves tracing a killer virus whose roots lie in "fountain of youth" hormone transplants. With all the recent talk about biochemical warfare and killer viruses, this book is sure to strike a chord with the public.One question -- what's with the naked babe on the cover of the book? I guess Gerritsen's having a hard time letting go of her romance roots.

When someone who isn't a mystery reader recommends a mystery, I always want to read it, and this one was recommended by my sister-in-law. It's a sweet little book, and while I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped, I did enjoy it. I prefer more traditionally-constructed mysteries. Worth a read, and I definitely plan on picking up some of the author's other series

I want to like these books more than I do. I enjoy them -- they're clever and sweet. But they're not too exciting, and at parts a little slow. I'd like to see heavier plotting in terms of the mysteries -- they're almost a sidebar to the story, rather than the main focus. One thing I really appreciate is the author's insight into human nature -- Mma Rotsawe is sort of an African Miss Marple. I must say I'm hooked on the series.

I thought this would be a collection of humorous, self-deprecating essays on what it's like to be a Type B personality in a Type A world. Instead, Mead-Ferro manages to alienate just about everyone (with the exception of her four-person family) in the first couple of chapters.As a humor writer, I learned early on that humor at the expense of self is funny; humor at the expense of others is mean-spirited. Mead-Ferro has no qualms about using just about everyone around her as fodder for her holier-than-thou pen. Got more toys than can fit in a small 2-by-2 box? You're materialistic and setting your child up for a lifetime of unhappiness as she seeks meaning from the store shelves. You scrapbook? You're destined to create an egomaniacal child who views himself as the center of the universe (what child doesn't?).If you were raised on a sprawling cattle ranch, as the author was, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, walk right by it in the bookstore and head for Anne Lamott's "Operating Instructions" or even an old Erma Bombeck. They're better-written, and they won't leave you feeling inadequate and rotten.

Anne Lamott is at her best when she's writing about her faith and her kid; she's at her worst when she ventures into the realm of political commentary. Unfortunately, this book had too much of the latter and not enough of the former. There are some gems here, but not enough to make me recommend it.

Okay, I'll admit it -- this is not my favorite kids' book in the world. In fact, I probably wouldn't pick it up if my kids didn't ask for it again. And again. And again.The illustrations are a bit wobbly, and the poetry is less than inspired ("Goodnight house. Goodnight mouse. Goodnight mittens. Goodnight kittens.")). But my children -- all three -- have adored this book and begged for it over and over again.Let's face it -- We're not reading for ourselves; we're reading for them. So give in and get this book. You might regret it (after the 100th reading), but your kids won't.

It's difficult to rate an investment advice book without actually taking the advice and seeing how successful it is. What I can say about this small tome is:-It's written in a very straightforward, accessible manner-It contains some very goofy, dorky humor that, while making me groan, also made me appreciate the author more-Its underlying premises seem quite logical and sound-I plan on taking the advice provided.One thing I was especially happy to see was that when I went to the associated website, I was certain that I would be charged for a "membership" to search for appropriately capitalized companies. This didn't happen - after a quick registration process, I was rewarded with a complete list of companies. I was so relieved that the book didn't turn out to be a 100-plus page ad for the site.I'll come back in a few years and tell you how it all worked.

Rare is the book that actually lives up to its promises. This book does it. Written by a sister-sister team (one a writer, one an artist), this book shows you step-by-step how -- and why -- to create a visual journal. From color selection to images, it discusses projects, how-tos, tips, and more. A great choice for those who want to investigate or dabble in visual journaling but aren't sure where to start.

When I was pregnant with my first child, I picked up nearly every book on the bookstore shelves having to do with pregnancy and childbirth. I wanted comfort, a friend in the form of a book, a companion to hold my hand and let me know everything was going to be okay.This book was not that friend.Instead, everytime I read this book, I found myself getting more and more agitated. It exposed me to almost TOO much information, verging on the point of overload. You know how medical students become convinced they have every wacky and rare disease they learn about in med school? That's how I felt when I read this book. After each chapter, I became convinced my child had Downs Syndrome, that I had placenta previa, that I was suffering from gestational diabetes, etc., etc.Now that I have three children, I feel like I'm in the position to make a recommendation -- get this book if you must, but don't read it cover to cover. Use it as a resource if one of the other books you read (I suggest "The Mother of All Pregnancy Books" by Ann Douglas) leaves you wanting more information.By the way, I didn't follow the "Best Odds Diet" and my kids still turned out fine. :)

It's been a long time since I've disliked a protagonist as much as I hated Ivy Ames. While the premise of the book was intriguing (an insider's view into the cut-throat world of the Manhattan elite), my antipathy for Ivy overroad any hopes of my giving this book a good review.She continually baffled me with her amoral stance and her ability to turn everything into a one-woman whine-fest. There was almost no one to cheer for, save some of the stereotypical "underclass" children. I almost quit reading several times, but somehow convinced myself to carry on.It's unfortunate, because Quinn is a talented writer. She just needs to work on creating some likable characters -- maybe some with morals.

What a strange and beautifully written novel. It's written in reverse timeline, as the protagonist (called at different times, Lillian, Patsy, Beautiful, Princess and Winnie), a more-than-a-little loony bag lady, attempts to recreate her own life while at the same time trying to forget some of the more painful parts.The reader is left to figure out what is truth, what is a figment of Winnie's imagination, what is a result of her mental illness, and what is just pure creation on her part in order to keep herself from feeling pain too deeply.The storyline brought to mind the movie "Memento" where the main character suffered from short-term memory loss and had to tattoo reminders onto his body. Like "Memento," "Remember Me" plays with the idea of truth and memory, and the secrets we tell to -- and keep from -- even ourselves.

This book was really disappointing. It had such a great premise -- a stay-at-home mom is forced to return to her previous profession as a celebrity publicist when her husband loses his job, and she has to deal with the challenges of work re-entry, becoming the sole breadwinner, and babysitting a grumpy has-been.But the story soon peters out. None of the various storylines ever is fully fleshed out. The relationship with her husband -- who is doing a better job of being a stay-at-home mom than she ever did -- suffers little in the way of stress. The guilt she feels as a working mom is glossed over. And the testy has-been actress never gets the dressing-down she so richly deserves.All in all, this was a well-written, though lukewarm, book. I never felt empathy for Julia, instead I wanted to give her a swift kick for being such a doormat.

One problem I've noticed with prolific, successful writers is it seems like their editors take a break. No one is catching the little errors (and the big plot boo-boos) because they're not giving the same level of scrutiny they would to a greener writer's work. And that is the case in "Photo Finished."I really enjoy Carmela and her friends. But hearing about her "tawny hair" multiple times in the first few pages was a little annoying. And the absolutely inane things she does in the name of chasing down the murderer are just too much (going to an abandoned warehouse at night? messing around the dead man's store, unaccompanied??). And why in the heck did Bobby, the police's number-one suspect, drop in on Carmela? He says nothing of real import, then drops out of sight once again. It was merely a way of furthering the plot that made absolutely no sense. The same with the way Shamus is urging Carmela to attend "family" functions when the entire Meechum clan -- including Shamus himself -- has made it clear that she's no longer "one of them."One final thing -- the yo-yoing with Shamus is getting old. And he is such a cad (flirting with other women in front of her, giving her a hard time about keeping her company when she was afraid, etc.), that if Carmela actually gets together with him, I am DONE with this series. Or should I say, "photo finished" with it??

No matter what you think about Martha Stewart, you cannot argue with her business success. She's managed to turn the domestic arts into a multi-multi-multi-million-dollar empire. This book shares her suggestions for entrepreneurs so they can take advantage of her numerous successes and occasional failures. Written in a straightforward, no-nonsense tone, this book is full of concrete examples and practical advice. A great read for anyone in the business world who wants to take their company to the next level.

I'll be honest -- after reading 50 pages of this book, I got off the StairMaster at the gym, put the book in my bag, and had no interest in reading any more of it. It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress" by Susan Jane Gilman or "Running with Scissors" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read.

I was doubtful when my husband brought this movie home (the last few Latifah movies I've seen have been pretty lame). But our family really enjoyed this movie.It was great seeing cameos by Timothy Hutton (he looks OLD!) and Gerard Depardieu. And the "sieze the day" message combined with a dose of "Pretty Woman" was a perfect family movie, even with the PG-13 rating (not sure why it was rated that highly).

I wish Katrina Kenison lived next door to me so she would invite me over for a cup of tea when I was feeling particularly harried (um, like NOW??). She has a way of reducing things to their most important denominators and forgoing all the rest.

I love the concept behind this book -- that ordinary, everyday kindnesses can have far-reaching results. But the book was simply too long and complicated for young children to understand. I tried to read this to my four-year-old, and she had little patience for the wordy story. She also showed absolutely no interest in the mathematics of how one person can affect many. And my older kids (ages 8 and 10) found the story too simplistic.While I love the story, it misses the age groups on both ends, being simultaneously too simple for older kids and too complicated for younger ones.

I have to admit I feel a little nerdy reading a novel set in a yarn shop. At the same time, though, it was so fun reading about how other women (fictional though they may be) connected over knitting. I've yet to create a knitting community, though I long for one. Debbie Macomber's storytelling reminds me of Maeve Binchy, and I plan on reading the first book in the series. I did find this a bit cute, but her ease with words makes it worth a read.

Nora Ephron is, hands-down, one of the funniest women in America. Her novels, movies, and essay collections have brought me to tears by way of laughter more than once. That's why I was a bit disappointed by this collection of essays, loosely tied around the topic of aging.The essays on aging were amusing, but not particularly funny or fresh. It was like eating a day-old doughnut -- still tasty, but probably not worth all the calories. The weird thing -- her non-age-related essays were brilliant. The piece on her love affair with her apartment was a treasure, as was the one about her life in 3500 words or less. I almost felt like her agent or publisher told her she needed to write about getting old, so she did lip service to the topic but snuck in "other stuff" that in actuality is the best part of the book.If you're an Ephron fan, check it out. Not as great as "Scribble Scribble," but still worth a read.

Take a good helping of "The Perks of Being a Wallflower," add a heaping spoonful of "Girl, Interrupted," and stir in a dollop or two of "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close," and you'll have a good idea what you're going to get with "Funny Story."A week after the author, Ned Vizzini, was discharged from his own stay in the psychiatric ward of a New York hospital, he began the tale of depressed teen Craig Gilner. On the point of suicide, Craig checks himself into the hospital, hoping to come to find hope beyond his depression. Inside he gains perspective on his illness, his current lifestyle, and his own talents and strengths.Smoothly written with a strong voice, "Funny Story" is full of vivid, real characters. What rings less true is Craig's almost-miraculous recovery and ability to gain a new lease on life after only five days. However, the fairly unbelievably happy ending was welcome after the flood of depressing books that seem to be hitting the charts.

After making her mark in the medical thriller realm, Gerritsen expands her reach into the realm of standard police procedurals with "Vanish." In typical Gerritsen style, the prose flows smoothly, the characters are richly drawn, and more than one woman loses her life in support of the plot line.Speaking of plot, the conspiracy theory seemed a little far-fetched to me, and the loose threads left at the end of the book kept this from being a four-star review. But lovers of Gerritsen's medical thrillers will enjoy the return of old favorites like Isley and Rizzoli, and fans of conspiracy theories will enjoy seeing the government guys turn out to be the bad guys -- and get their just rewards.

Maybe it's just some personality defect on my part, but Anna Quindlen kind of bugs me. I never got into her columns, and I wasn't crazy about her novel, "Black and Blue." And anyone who has the chutzpah to publish a book of "life secrets" that's only 64 pages -- and to charge $12.95 for it -- is someone I don't want to know very well.That said, I thought "Blessings" was an okay book. Not terrific, but worth a read if you're 3,000 miles from home and don't have a lot of other choices (which was my circumstance). Was I in love with it? Put it this way -- after I finished it, I left it in the hotel room.

I thought it would be hard to feel sorry for an upper-middle-class chick who makes near six figures and blows it all on Fendi bags and BCBG tees -- but I was wrong. I found myself identifying with Karyn way more than I thought I would in this entertaining, hilarious, and often sad first-person tale of consumerism and search for identity. I shared in her feelings of euphoria as she shopped the streets of NYC, and I felt for her when she hit rock bottom -- and I rooted for her when she started a website and solicited strangers for donations to bail her out.If you've enjoyed any of the fictional "Shopaholic" stories by Sophie Kinsella, you'll love "Save Karyn."

Did I miss something here? I read the whole book (okay, ALMOST the whole book -- I admit I skipped over the nonsensical instant messaging transcipts that seem to make up the bulk of the text, as well as the silly chapter intros) and I wasn't floored. Or even wowed. Or even that impressed.There's nothing in this book that you can't find out on your own with an Internet hookup and a brain cell or two to rub together. Most of it is rehashed medical journal articles, and the rest is puffery. And a lot of it was ridiculous! Any mom can tell you that YES, sugar makes kids act up -- even if it isn't scientifically "proven." Any teenager can tell you YES, you can pop certain kinds of zits with virtually no ill effects (what was this weirdo story about causing abcesses in your sinus cavities by squeezing your pimples??? I have NEVER in my 38 years heard of such a thing).The book seemed to be written more for the authors' enjoyment and entertainment than anything else. Parts of it were downright rude, and the rest was either worthless or unbelievable. Sorry to be so harsh, but I really expected more.

The unease that has been plaguing me for years now -- I call it "Mall Malaise," finally has scientific basis! It appears to be true - instead of choice bringing more happiness, it actually can frustrate and depress us when taken to the extreme.Schwartz's easy-to-read analysis of the pluses and minuses of choice, coupled with scientific/psychological studies on why we feel as we do, will help a generation of overachievers and overconsumers find peace in the midst of plenty.My favorite part -- instead of just explaining the phenomenon, Schwartz provides suggestions on how to mitigate the negative effects of too much choice.I feel better already.

As an obsessive-compulsive type, I typically have a horrid time quitting a book before finishing it. IN this case, however, I had virtually no qualms about packing it in three-quarters of the way through.I expected this book to be fantastic, a riveting "In Cold Blood"-type take on a heinous crime. Instead, it was a long (and I mean LONG) discussion of the Mormon faith.While it's true that the murderers were at one point related to the Mormons, their particular brand of "Mormonism" bears about as much resemblance to the faith as McDonald's does to gourmet cuisine. They may come from the same place, but they have diverged enormously along the way.I found the link between the history of Mormonism and the Laffertys' crimes to be tenuous at best, and couldn't bring myself to handle another few hours of 19th century history just to get to the end of this arduous read.

I haven't been this annoyed by a book in a long time. And the funny thing is, I agreed with most of what Darla Shine had to say!But her holier-than-thou attitude, coupled with her ability to spew anecdotal evidence as fact, tossed with an amazing amount of contradictions, did me in. Add her filthy mouth, and I was finished.For instance:-She says our moms went to the grocery store in their curlers and housecoats, but "knew themselves" better than we do. Then a few pages later, she says women shouldn't dare to go outside in sweatshirts and leggings.-She talks about how "her girls" (meaning her girlfriends) are so cute and put-together, then a page or so later tells of two of her girlfriends who wear their husbands' button-down shirts.-She bemoans the lack of family values in today's media and culture, then goes on about how she wanted to shove her shopping cart into some woman's "fat @$$" at the supermarket because she's buying frozen dinners and chips.-She rips "Desperate Housewives" to shreds, but has obviously watched enough of the show to spout plot lines and character details.The sad thing is, I agree with Shine's "Don't Whine" philosophy. And if **I** couldn't take it, how is she ever going to reach those who need her message most?

Don't go into this novel expecting another Bridget Jones. While a lot of the same ingredients are there -- boorish men, flighty yet appealing women, and star-crossed lovers -- that's where the similarities end. Cause Celeb is more a wake-up call intending to make the public aware of the need for continued support of African famine relief than it is a love story. There are comedic elements, but I cried more than I laughed.

I now know why it was so hard for the publishers to write the jacket blurb for this book. What is it truly about? The nature of love and loss, I suppose -- and finding peace with yourself, vis-a-vis your parents. Forgiveness, grief, and friendship, too. I am awed by the richness of the lives Robinson has created, but less impressed with the pacing of the book. Very, very, very slow.

The best way to make customers talk about your company and products is to give them something to talk about. Seems like common sense, right? But according to Seth Godin, few businesses take the simple steps needed to bring their products to the front of the pack.In this collection of short essays, or "riffs," as he calls them, author Godin tells you how and why to revamp your product development cycle and marketing efforts to highlight your company's "remarkable" aspects. A must-read for any entrepreneur looking to be the next new thing.

I really enjoy this "cozy" murder mystery series, with amateur sleuth/wedding planner Carnegie Kincaid. Deborah Donnelly's story lines are always entertaining and liberally sprinkled with humor at the expense of Carnegie's Bridezilla du Jour.This particular story was a bit convoluted, with a number of new characters dumped on the reader simultaneously. Even at the end of the story, I felt like I needed a scorecard to keep up. All the same, Donnelly does a fairly good job of distinguishing even the most minor of characters.A good, but not overwhelming plot, coupled with a look into Carnegie's past, makes for a solid book. I must say, though, the cliffhanger ending is a bit over-the-top. If Aaron's truly gone, then I say good riddance. I wasn't too thrilled with him anyway.

I always wonder how Debbie Bliss can keep on creating such gorgeous designs -- but she does it again and again! This volume will be a much-used part of your knitting library. Tons of great patterns and clear instructions. The only problem is, which pattern to start with?

Fantastic! A page-turner from the opening sentence, "The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes" traces the story of several generations of women: CeeCee's mother, who died when CeeCee was only 12, but who comes alive to the reader through a series of letters she leaves CeeCee; CeeCee, who finds herself in a relationship -- and a crime -- way over her head as a naive 16-year-old; and Corinne, CeeCee's adopted daughter.Through a series of bad decisions, 16-year-old CeeCee gets swept up in a horrific crime, resulting in her kidnapping of a newborn. She decides to raise Corinne as her own, and only in her later life does the truth emerge.Reminiscent of Jodi Picoult with its unraveling lives and compelling plot line, it also brought to mind "The Memory Keeper's Daughter" and "The Most Wanted" (the latter by Jacquelyn Mitchard.A quick, touching, fabulous book that questions what it means to be a mother, how our past affects our future, and just how long we must pay for the crimes of our youth.

Earlene Fowler has done it again! In my book (no pun intended), she is fast setting the standard for amateur sleuth series. She has a way of being provocative without preaching, touching without being overly sentimental, and making readers want to come back again and again. This is one of the best in the series.

Person-to-person interviews between Terry Gross and a dozen big-name authors. Some are hilarious (David Sedaris and David Rakoff) while some are thought provoking (Norman Mailer and John Updike). But where are all the women? Fran Lebowitz was asked about becoming famous for NOT writing, and how she deals with age (something Terry didn't ask James Baldwin!). Joyce Johnson spoke entirely about her relationship with Jack Kerouac, not about her own work. From a female interviewer, I expected more.

My second time reading this book. Diane M-D's one of my favorite mystery authors, and I re-read her books at least once every few years. This particular novel was a little convoluted with a lot going on, but I appreciate her attempts to increase the sophistication of her plots. As all of her culinary mysteries, worth reading.

I don't know if I would have picked up this book if I knew it was published under the Harlequin imprint. I have nothing against romances -- they're just not my cup of tea. So I was pleasantly surprised when, after reading the book and discovering it was from Harlequin, I thought it was pretty darned good.Overall, Peterson is a smooth writer. The plot was an interesting one full of twists and a few predictable turns, yet not too banal or too hard to follow. There were a few instances where the perfect character emerged at the perfect time with the perfect clue, but hey, I'm willing to overlook that.I did think the main character (Killian) was a wee bit squeamish for someone who was supposed to be a cop. I doubt a real cop would almost keel over at the sight of a dead body lying in a puddle of blood -- at least, not one with 8 years on the force.My summation: A good story with some fun characters, but if I never see them in another book, I won't be too depressed. It was fun while it lasted.

My biggest beef with this book is that 80 percent of it was a non-fiction discussion of finance for women, while only about 20 percent of it was truly a memoir. All the same, Perle included a ton of great info on women and their relationships with money.Another niggling item: while she loudly calls for the need for women to be more open about their relationship with money, Perle herself kept much hidden behind the veil. She alludes to "six-figure salaries" and "what I realistically needed to live" but never names numbers.I also found the idea that she would let her ex -- who dumped HER -- take his stock options and run to be ridiculous. She said she traded those options for a good relationship with him -- Hmmm, sounds like the "inner stewardess" she so decried in earlier chapters was not quite as dead as she had claimed.I felt that the book ended on too much of a Pollyanna note. "I made peace with money and so can you!" she says, without sharing enough of the dirty details with us. I just didn't buy (pun intended) the notion that all was as rosy as she purports. This book would have been more valuable to me if she had focused more on telling her own story and tracing her relationship in more detail, rather than glossing over her own history in favor of one more quote from the "experts."

Patricia Volk's memoir of her family and its 100-year history in the restaurant business is as much a history of New York as it is a recounting of her relatives. Touching, funny, sad, quirky -- this book has it all. Volk is a talented writer with the ability to create a vivid character on the page. I finished this book wishing I'd been part of their clan.

After you've read a few Jodi Picoult books, you come to expect certain things. A compelling, flashpoint topic (teen suicide, stigmata, school shootings, sexual abuse, etc.) that rips a small New England community apart. Courtroom drama. Finely wrought family dynamics. A maverick lawyer, a quirky judge, and a lot of angst. Tons of plot twists and turns.All of the above were present in "The Pact," a story of the death of a teenage golden girl, with her longtime boyfriend accused of the murder -- which he claims was a double suicide gone awry. The defendant bobs and weaves as news of Emily's pregnancy comes to light, and plenty of red herrings are thrown into the mix. But still something was missing.I felt like there just wasn't quite ENOUGH drama in this book... I expected one more horrifying secret to be revealed at the end. I did not believe that Emily's reasons for killing herself were sufficiently grave. And I couldn't believe that NO ONE -- not the police, not his parents, not the lawyer, no one -- asked Chris what really happened that night.Stilll, with Picoult's wonderful writing, this book is still worth reading.

There was much to like about this book -- an interesting setting (who doesn't love N'Awlins?), a curious premise, and the added benefit of great recipes. I enjoyed following Carolyn Blue's attempts to locate her missing friend in the Big Easy.Conversely, several elements bothered me. Carolyn never seemed real -- her character was half "dippy dame," as my father would say, and half academic-from-the-ivory-tower. She never rang true to me.The plot also was a bit far-fetched, with more than a hint of deus ex machina when Julienne's brother appears from nowhere to grab center stage. We should have received at least a hint of his presence and culpability earlier in the book.Too many disparate threads -- old friends at a reunion, the chemists at a convention, Carolyn's book-writing, the strange crimes that keep befalling her, the love interest with the policeman, and feuding spouses -- that left me reeling.

I was a little disappointed to discover that much of the writing guide part of the book was written by a (relatively) unknown author, Ina something or other. I really expected it to be all Janet Evanovich's work. In fact, in some parts, Ina's tips are contrary to what Janet says she does. Interesting.If you are looking for an A-to-Z guide to writing a book, this is not it. If you're looking for some great entertaining tidbits about your favorite mystery author, coupled with a few hints on writing, then you might want to give this a try. Parts were very entertaining with the typical Evanovich humor. But I wouldn't say that my writing will improve much as a result of reading this book.

How does Joan Hess do it again and again and again? Her Claire Malloy mysteries are funny, smart, and interesting. She has me hooked by the cleverness of her heroine, as well as by the intricacies of the plot. I devoured this one in a single plane ride. I do think Claire may be becoming a bit TOO testy, but just a tad, as her ascerbic wit is part of her unending charm. Well done, Ms. Hess!

Pun intended... I kept waiting for this story to take off, and it never really did. When the protagonist is dumped by her ready-to-be-live-in-lover, her world is turned upside down, and she looks for meaning between the pages of "Scientific American." A great premise, but no payoff. The whole thing seemed like a lead-up to SOMETHING... a revenge fantasy brought to life, a romance that would erase her memories of Ray... but nothing. Great writing, and some funny lines, but definitely lukewarm chicklit. You can do better with your time.

In a book as research-rich as this one, I expected the writing to be "scholarly" and dense -- the opposite was true! I was surprised to find Gladwell's writing to be accessible and easy to read. I do wish there were more of a take-away, though -- is the conclusion to trust your gut because it's founded in conclusions drawn from data? Or not to trust your gut, because it can be wrong? Or only trust your gut if you're an expert? Not sure. But I'll trust my gut and recommend this book.

I was a little skeptical about this series. I'm a knitter, not a needleworker, so I wasn't sure I'd be interested in the inner workings of an embroidery shop, even with a mystery thrown in. But the cast of characters was intriguing, and the plot had enough twists and turns to keep any mystery lover enthralled. Not the deepest book I've ever read, but interesting enough to make me want to read more of the series -- and maybe even try a needlepoint project some time!

The difficulty in critiquing memoirs is that it's near impossible for me to critique the writing without critiquing the life. In this case, there is much to raise one's eyebrows at in Julia Cameron's long, fruitful, and erratic life (she seems to be ruled by the winds as much as by the muse).But her writing is clear, her life has been an interesting one, and she seems to hold little back when writing about her challenges and struggles with mental illness and alcoholism. A fragile, yet indominatable personality, Cameron bounces from one side of the continent to the other, generating reams of prose, poetry, songs, and other artistic works on the way.My biggest beef with her life is the way that she seems to see others as bit players in her drama ("Everywhere I turned, people seemed to have their own agendas," she moans in one chapter, wondering why her friends and acquaintances are unwilling to drop their own lives to help caretake in hers).My biggest beef with her writing is her overuse of the adjective "little." Everywhere she lived is described as her "little cottage," or her "little apartment." It's a "little" too precious, if you know what I mean.All in all, though, Cameron remains an inspirational and impressive creative force in a world that could use more of her type of energy.

I am an intermediate knitter, and I had a lot of trouble with this book. First, many of the patterns are just not that appealing. They're quite bulky -- and while thicker yarns do knit up quickly, they're not so attractive on anyone larger than a beanpole. While I'm fairly small (size 6), I do have a chest and cannot imagine wearing such bulky garments.Second, I found the yarn selections hard to substitute because of the way they were almost all used double. And the yarns suggested were quite expensive.All in all, I resold my book on Amazon after holding on to it for about six months. I just never was that interested in knitting anything in it. I like the kids' book much better, and am looking forward to the "Beyond the Basics" book.

I'm not sure what this book is supposed to be -- a tell-all? An exploration of the history of cleaning and its place in western culture? A treatise about the underclass? I think part of the problem is that the author herself is not sure where she is, in the metaphysical sense. I couldn't tell why she was a cleaner. If she liked it. Even where she lived! And as far as "other people's dirt," there was precious little here. Not at all what I expected. I was more than a little annoyed at the curious tone the book took towards the idea that those who hire cleaners are somehow exploiting them... Very confusing. I was looking for an author who was going to dish some dirt and instead got an earful about Marxist theory.

This novel could have been a gripping tale of a marriage's end, but instead it read like a watery, detached account from a woman who'd given up long ago. Am I the only reader who rolled her eyes when Rose basically lay down and played dead when she lost her job to her husband's new paramour? Talk about giving up without a fight. Maybe it's the American in me, but I would have been at the lawyer's within minutes after that encounter.I had trouble believing that the woman dealing with her philandering husband with such equanimity and lack of emotion was the same Rose who trekked through the rainforest and longed for adventures a few decades earlier. Where did all the passion go? Rose also seemed much to eager and willing to take on responsibility for Nathan's behavior, saying she "should have known he was unhappy." Bollocks!Despite these complaints, many of the secondary characters -- Poppy and Alice, in particular, were compelling and fun to read about, and rang quite true. I would have liked to see that same level of quirkiness and personality in Buchan's main characters."First Wives Club," this is not. But it is an interesting, thoughtful look at marriage, love, and relationships, and what makes them work.

Okay, I have to admit. I didn't get this book. I mean, on one level I totally got it. But on another, I think I'm missing something. Maybe I'm too conservative (or too young) to really understand the whole "Beat" thing. It's got something to do with sex, drugs, jazz, the Beatitudes, and the Beatles -- right?Anyway, even not "getting" the book, I still loved Kerouac's writing. Talk about energy! He was a master of the descriptive phrase. Very vivid, exciting, evocative, and still accessible. I will read more of his work, not necessarily for the "message," but for the language.

I was thrilled to get this book, hoping it would reveal the secrets of fixing my own work WITHOUT having to rip out row after row. And while the pictorial guides and explanations of what can go wrong are invaluable, in fact the advice the author offers, more often than not, is to "rip back to the mistake." Bah!All the same, while this guide has not saved me from frogging, it is a great addition to my knitting library. Now when something goes wrong, I can at least diagnose what it was, with the hopes I can avoid it the next time around.A great volume to include in any knitting book collection.

I have a zillion different scrapbooking books and magazines, and I'm always on the lookout for more. I think my search has ended.Cathy Zielske writes with warmth, humor, and creativity. She offers tons of tips and suggestions, as well as concrete guidelines for scrappers to follow. She enables you to adapt the layouts you see on the pages of your favorite magazines to your own style. This book offers more of what she wrote in the first volume, but it also goes further, getting into greater detail about how Cathy creates her fabulous style.I may never buy another idea book -- nahh, of course I will! But this one will have a place of honor on my shelf.

Rarely has a mystery grabbed me so completely from the first few paragraphs. I was so excited to discover this series about Regina Cutter, a newly divorced forty-something mom of two who tries to use her psychic ability to help the Boston Metropolitan Police.However, the story quickly degenerated from that early high. My complaints, in no particular order:-The title has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Hate that.-Too many coincidences -- the plot was wrapped up a bit too neatly with all the strange occurrences tying together.-At the same time, a lot of loose ends were left... what about Doc? What did he want to do with Regina?-Random quoting of Bible verses and Dante's Inferno that were distracting and laughable, rather than adding to the story.-Stark's deus ex machina appearances to save Regina just in the nick of time-What's this with the psychic who is basically useless? She never seems to pick up anything worth mentioning, yet so much is made of her psychic ability.What a disappointment. Tishy is a great writer and surely could have fixed many of the issues that made this book so lame. I may try another Regina Cutter mystery in the future, but only if I get a psychic message to do so.

This book, the first in this series that I've read, was okay. The plot was paper-thin, and there wasn't enough tension to keep me turning the pages. However, Swanson's writing is smooth.Swanson's characters need more development to make them compelling, and I felt that she treated them as naive country bumpkins. Just because someone lives in a small town doesn't make them ignorant or unsophisticated.Not a winner, but definitely in the running.

Min's story of Orchid, a rural teenager of noble blood who submits herself for consideration as one of the Emperor's 3000 concubines in order to save her family from poverty, is heart-wrenching and horrifying. The author's strength lies in her ability to bring to life 19th century empirial China -- in all its splendor and bloody ruthlessness. However, Orchid lost my sympathy halfway through the book when her manipulative ways overshadowed her tenderness. The novel does bring to mind questions of family, loyalty, and love. Worth a read.

After falling in love with "Stitch and Bitch," I automatically ordered "Nation." Unfortunately, I returned it soon after I got it. I looked through it and realized there wasn't a single pattern that I would wear.I am a thirty-something Californian, so I'm not stuffy or ultra-conservative. But this book definitely fell on the other side of the "hip" line from me. I would imagine it would appeal to a certain audience, but I wasn't in it.The first book had a much wider appeal. I'll be sticking with that one.

"Running with Scissors" was so horrifying, and "Dry" was so fraught with misery, that I was a bit scared to pick up "Magical Thinking." But this collection of essays is so darned funny. Burroughs makes no pretense of being warm and fuzzy -- in fact, he is blatant about his lack of compassion and his prejudices. But that's what makes his writing -- on topics as diverse as finding love in New York, log cabins, and killing wee beasties that sneak into his apartment -- so refreshing and hilarious. A must-read for fans of David Sedaris.

This book was like half a book -- something Cornwell sat down and spewed out over a long weekend or so. In general, authors would then go back and edit their work, but it appears in this case that her half-baked manuscript somehow made it past all the editorial gatekeepers, straight to hard copy.I hate how everyone in Scarpetta's life is so dysfunctional, grumpy, and repetitive. And I hate how Cornwell left us hanging with so many unanswered questions and incomplete plot points (what the heck happened to Joe???). And I hate that I spent money on this awful book.

I would venture to say that any lover of books has toyed with the idea of working at the mecca for bibliophiles, a bookstore. Strempek Shea -- not just any book lover but also a bestselling author -- shows us what it's like on the other side of the cash register.Shea has a way with words, and her turns of phrase are always skillful and often unexpected. I enjoyed the way she wove details about the publishing business with the details about the inner workings of the store and its many colorful characters.She did seem testy at times, particularly when describing her reaction to some customers' requests. And I found her denigration of Bill O'Reilly to be unwarranted (what happened to nonjudgment??). And it was interesting that she -- who is so sensitive about her own name being spelled correctly -- misspelled the title of Mitch Albom's "Tuesdays with Morrie."Those are just minor peeves, though, and overall I give this book a high rating. If you love the written word, you'll love this book .

Yes, I'm on a Carlotta Carlyle kick... and this book was a perfect follow-up to Deep Pockets. While DP kept Carlotta and crew in the Boston metro area, Heart of the World takes the show on the road to Miami, Bogota, and beyond.As usual, the plot is intricate and waterproof. The characters are vivid and unforgettable. And the relationships between Carlotta, Sam, Mooney, and others are progressing to critical inflection points. Something has got to give, and in this book, you'll find out what does.Carlotta traces Paolina, apparently kidnapped by her drug lord father and taken out of the country. She has to face tough questions about her morality, her relationships, and her past as she tracks Paolina around the world, from the projects of Boston to the highest mountains of Colombia.Another must-read for mystery fans.

While this book has, by far, one of the best titles I've seen in a long time, I can't say the same for the rest of the book. Rife with one-dimensional characters and rip-offs from the Stephanie Plum series, Ninja Soccer Moms should have been benched. And there should be a federal law against using "Omigod!" more than once in a book -- unless it's an Archie comic.

I'm always up for a good psychological thriller, and Picoult certainly knows how to pick her topics. Memory regression, teen mass murder sprees, suicide pacts - you name it, and she's right there.Though this book approaches the topic from an oblique angle, The Tenth Circle is, at its core, a story about family and the strength of those familial bonds. By tracing what happens to the Stone family after their daughter, Trixie, claims she has been raped by her ex-boyfriend, we investigate what love can drive us to do, and what it can - and cannot - save us from.My main criticism about Picoult's body of work is that her books seem to be too quickly executed with loose ends and unfinished edges left flapping. This novel was largely an exception to that complaint. I was pleasantly surprised to see how neatly everything tied together and circled back on itself (no pun intended). From Daniel's Alaskan upbringing, to his comic book art, to his wife's classes - it all wove together into a complete whole.Because I've never read Dante, I can't comment on how well Picoult manages to replicate the ten circles of Hell, but enough was explained in the text that even those readers with gaping holes in their education (like myself!) are able to keep up.

While I loved hearing the inside scoop on what goes on at a mystery conference, this was far from my favorite Jane Jeffry book. All the regular elements are there -- Jane and Shelley, a mystery, and interesting characters -- but the characters seem to trot in and out without much development. And Jane and Shelley seemed particularly catty in this book, especially in regards to judging others they come in contact with.The warmth of previous books is missing while the two wine and dine and shop (and make snarky remarks about their fellow attendees).The mystery is pretty transparent, too, and not even fully resolved at the end of the book.After looking forward to this one for so long, I was disappointed.

I don't think there's any way I could possibly identify with what Immaculee Ilibagiza experienced in Rwanda. But her story has gone a long way towards helping me see the devastating effects of civil war in her country.I am just beginning to learn what has happened in Rwanda, and stories like Immaculee's in turns horrify me, and give me hope. If someone who has experienced what she has can find room in her heart to forgive her aggressors and move on, then I can overcome some of the petty angers and trials I experience in my own life.

The first thing to know about this book is that it was written in seral format for a newspaper in Scotland. The second thing to know is that it doesn't make a lot of sense. The third thing is -- if you can get past the first two, this book is downright hilarious. Don't expect a great work of fiction, but do expect some wry observations on the human condition, as well as some unique characters.I would have liked to see things wrapped up a bit more at the end (What happened to Bertie? And Lizzie? And Big Lou??), but still -- LOVED THIS. Alexander McCall Smith is an intelligent, entertaining, and quirky writer.

After hearing Falick on a podcast and hearing the "story behind the book," I picked this up at the local yarn store to leaf through it -- and quickly remembered why I hand't bought it the first five times I'd looked at it.I find the concept of this book somewhat garbled -- is it a pattern book? If so, there aren't enough interesting patterns to make it worth the investment (most are very dated). Is it a profile book? If so, there really isn't enough in-depth info about either the yarn stores or the store owners to make it entertaining.The photography, however, is gorgeous. So I've finally categorized this book as a "collectible." If you're looking for knitting patterns, don't bother. But if you want something pretty to set on your coffee table -- or if you own every other knitting book out there and need this one to complete your library -- then go for it. Otherwise, leaf through it at the store, admire the pictures, then put it gently back on the shelf and walk away.

I'm as much a sucker as the next gal for a good chick lit book -- and Sophie Kinsella still is tops on the list, in my humble opinion! In her latest novel, she has all the winning elements of a Bridget Jones-ish hit... a bumbling yet lovable heroine, a dashing leading man, and a comedy of errors. It's laugh-out-loud funny, with enough romance to keep you swooning. Great beach read.

I was really disappointed in this book. The premise was terrific -- two decades after the disappearance of her little sister, Caroline Winters sees a photo in a magazine that looks just like her missing sibling. After putting her life on hold (giving up Juilliard in favor of serving drinks in the Big Easy), Caroline must decide whether to give up the half-life she has in favor of finally discovering the truth about her absent sister.The problem was that I didn't care about a single person in this tortuous narrative. Caroline is self-centered and immature; her remaining sister Madeline is a two-dimensional cut-out, and their mother is merely words on the page. The most compelling figures are the women Caroline works with in the bar, and they serve only as window dressing.While it's a quick read, it really wasn't worth the effort for the lukewarm denouement.

Waldman has an easy way with words, and she seemed to hit her stride in this book. There are a few eye-rolling moments when even my quite liberal suspension of disbelief gene was twanging with outrage (Juliet thinks the Hasidic 18-year-old, looks-like-a-young-Liz-Taylor, reminds her of herself???), but I'm willing to overlook those in favor of a fairly seamless plotline and fun, lively characters.

I adore "behind-the-scenes" stories like this one, and Burau's book definitely gave me a new perspective on the unsung heroes at the other end of the 9-1-1 line. Burau paints a vivid picture of life in a windowless room, complete with colorful characters and office politics.Well-written, humorous, and touching, the book gets a thumbs-up. But was I the only one who had trouble with the idea that a former drug addict could find her way to such a high-pressure, mission-critical job?

I can buy that Sookie is incredibly attractive to the average undead. And I can buy that she just seems to encounter dead bodies every time she turns around. But I still have trouble understanding how SO MUCH seems to happen to her. I'm not looking for realism (or I wouldn't be reading a book about vampires), but I would like a little more pacing and plotting so I can recover from one near-brush with death before another comes tearing around the corner.All the usual suspects make their appearance in this book, but the focus is on her relationship with were-tiger Quinn (why oh why have all the hot bad boys suddenly taken to calling their ladies "babe," a la Ranger in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series??). Her brother makes a brief appearance, and she also gets the opportunity to solve an apparent kidnapping using her telepathic powers. But I must say, if Sookie keeps up with the attitude, she isn't going to have many friends left. Call me crazy, but if I did have telepathic abilities, I think I'd be eager to assist the police in whatever way I could.ANYWAY, another head-snapping book full of peril and drama. A little too rich for my blood, but maybe that'll keep the vamps away.

Take four precocious children, intent on preserving their family and their lives, throw in two narcissistic parents so totally self-absorbed that they would rather spend the household money on art supplies and beer than on food for the kids, and shake until well-blended. Pour into a tall, frosty mug, and serve with a side dish of spicy peanuts.The Glass Castle traces the story of the Walls family through San Francisco, Nevada, Arizona, and West Virginia. But no matter how many miles they travel, the family's demons -- the father's alcoholism and the mother's mental illness -- follow along.Walls tells her tale without an ounce of self-pity or rancor. If there's a stronger woman alive, I'd like to know who it is.Fans of Terry Ryan's "The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio" and Augusten Burrough's "Running with Scissors" will love "The Glass Castle."

Augusten Burroughs is that wonderfully witty guy in the cubicle behind the filing cabinet who sends you snarky e-mails about your co-worker's shoes and your boss' receding hairline. Oh, how I wish I knew this guy in person! Fortunately, with "Possible Side Effects" I can pretend for a while that he is on my speed dial."Side Effects" is another collection of stories of dysfunctional relationships, love affairs gone awry, childhood horror stories, and more tales of life in the big city. Though he's covered much of this same ground before, the essays are never repetitive or boring; instead, I grow to love Burroughs more and more as he reveals ever-deeper layers of himself, his insecurities, and his quirks and foibles. I laughed, even as I hated myself for laughing. But that's what makes it so great.

Yes, another diet book. This one attempts to slim America by sharing the "secrets" that have worked for this Park Avenue diet doctor and her clients.The only problem: There's nothing new or "secret" here, and we all know that socialites drink like fish, smoke like chimneys, and frequent the plastic surgeon's office so often they should have frequent flier miles.Eat smaller portions. Push away the bread basket. Drink water instead of alcohol. Get 60 minutes of exercise a day. Sound familiar?I also had a problem with the "Manhattan is the center of the universe" attitude that Klauer adopted. You know, there are other states outside of New York, and we don't all have access to Central Park and NYC restaurants.All in all, it's not a BAD book. There's just nothing new. And nothing that's going to turn you into SJP overnight.

Paretsky is the master of the modern female private eye, and V.I. Warshawski set the tone for many of the female detectives who followed -- Kinsey Millhone, Sheriff Joanna Brady, etc. The latest in Paretsky's series offers readers a strong plot with vivid action scenes, and a nice mellowing of V.I.'s personality. The early books in the series were so tainted with her anger at life in general that I found them difficult to read. Now, V.I., seems to have sheared off some of her rough edges, leaving behind a lot of the "tough gal" persona that flavored the early works.This book has many strengths, including memorable characters, much action, a strong setting, and seamless prose. However, I wonder if Paretsky is getting tired as V.I. is mellowing? The plot was a bit shaky (V.I. had a bit too much of a free pass into offices that no one would allow her to gain access to, and her reasons for becoming involved in the shady business of the South Side were tenuous at best). And many characters are thinly drawn caricatures (the Poor Little Rich Boy in love with the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, the minority mother who works hard to keep off welfare, the heartless businessmen who cry "family values" but who will do anything to stay ahead, etc.). And even many of the old standbys (Lottie, Mr. Contreras, Conrad) seemed a bit tired of their roles, just popping on stage and then off again with no emotion or involvement.Overall, I rate this book highly because of its action and writing. But Paretsky may have to start relying on real human interaction for interest, instead of just sending V.I. on another trip to the emergency room.

An innovative and creative look at the birth of the Savior by focusing on the relationship between Mary and Joseph. I really appreciated thinking about the birth of Jesus from the perspective of a young couple who were floored with the news that they would be the earthly parents of the Savior. While this is no "The Red Tent," it still made me think about this precious story in a whole new way, and it brought me to tears several times.

I thought I'd heard of all the "good" mystery series with female protagonists... but somehow, this one slipped by me! I was more than pleasantly surprised by this book, #5 in Harris' "Vampire" mystery series about Sookie Stackhouse, a "gifted" waitress with a penchant for danger and deadly (or should I say, dead) men.Gothic appeal aside, this book was full of interesting characters, inventive plot twists, and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences -- including an Elvis sighting. I love an author who creates a world and pulls the reader into it completely, and Harris does that here. The only complaint I have is that Sookie had a few too many love interests -- including a werewolf, a werepanther, a "shifter," and a few vampires. That's quite a few, even for a paranormal chick.

Not the beefiest book on the block (125-ish pages with big type), this little volume is still full of great insights. Nothing earth-shaking, but plenty of reminders of how to remove yourself from the victim mentality and move forward in life. There are also many anecdotes that help drive the points home. Easy to read, uplifting, encouraging.I'm looking forward to reading QBQ as well.

This is without a doubt one of the best memoirs I have read -- and I've read a lot. Dumas treats even the toughest of topics (discrimination, political issues, etc.) with humor and humanity. The stories of her immigration to the US from Iran at an early age are hilarious, touching, and universal. Her book reminds readers that immigrants are, first and foremost, people.

If you are looking for a great read with strong characters and a malevolent villain, check this book out! I've been reading the Gerritsen books out of order, having just discovered her, but I still find them stand-alone stunners.Police detective Jane Rizzoli thought her nightmares were over when "the Surgeon," the man who stalked and nearly killed her, was arrested and sent to prison. But the visions of that final confrontation become even harder to forget when a new criminal seems to be adopting Hoyt's techniques. As if that weren't enough, Hoyt escapes from prison and begins taunting Rizzoli again.She must pull together all her faculties to fight evil, this time without the aid of her long-time partner. Rizzoli faces her own fears, and calls upon all her resources to meet Hoyt and his "apprentice."A must-read page-turner for anyone who loves a great thriller.

Rare is the thriller that can scare me enough to leave the lights on at night, while bringing me to tears. The Sinner did both. Filled with more twists and turns than a labyrinth, The Sinner throws a curve at both Jane Rizzoli and ME Maura Isles. Jane must deal with a huge obstacle in her life as well as her relationship with Gabriel Dean, and Maura must face her own ghosts in the form of her ex-husband.This book serves as a pivotal point in the character development of both women, and is a must-read if you are a follower of the series.The mystery itself is tantalizing and surprising. No plot spoilers here -- you must read it yourself to see how the death of two nuns in Boston relates to a terrorist attack on a colony of lepers in India. A true page-turner.

Full of twists and turns to keep you guessing, "Whispers and Lies" tells the story of solitary, 40-something Terry, a nurse with a small social life and a smaller cottage behind her house.She rents the cottage to Allison, who promises to enliven Terry's life. But soon questions and questionable folks pop up, and Terry is left wondering if she's getting drawn into a web she can't escape.A strong plot rolls out over several hundred pages, and then takes a sharp right turn -- and then another -- in the last chapters. My head was spinning so much by the end that I didn't realize all the loose ends Fielding left hanging, that are still niggling around in my brain. What was Lance trying to do? Why did Allison let him drug Terry? What about Denise and the gallery -- what really happened there? And the girl in the coma? What happened to her?While I enjoyed the book, I felt that Fielding tried to hard to deliver the unexpected, and in the end lost the reader. I felt duped and a bit angry.

I found this book to be very difficult to read, and more about the literature than about the lives of the women involved. The overblown prose and flowery language were difficult to decipher, and I fought to stay awake more than once. I had trouble finishing it, and never reached the point where the effort paid off in lessons learned or insights gained.

I have to ask, who hasn't heard all this before? Not only is the book repetitive and difficult to read -- it's also full of stuff that's been written by everyone from Napoleon Hill to Tony Robbins. Some "secret."Still, the power of positive thinking always bears repeating. But if you are looking for a way to make changes in your life, check out Jennifer Louden's "The Life Organizer." It shows how to create the life you love not through "magic," but by making it happen yourself, digging into the deepest parts of your heart to figure out what it is that you really DO want.

If you don't stay up until the wee hours frantically turning pages in order to see what happens next, you'll definitely lose a few hours of sleep as you listen to the creaks and groans of your house and wonder who -- or what -- is out there!Gerritsen has always been a standout in the field of the police procedural and medical thriller, but she really makes her mark with this mystery. From Police Detective Jane Rizzoli and her partner Barry Frost, to the evil and satanic Warren Hoyt, every character nearly jumps off the page -- and had me jumping out of my skin.Warning: This book, while not as graphic or distrubing as, say, The Shining, is not comfortable bedtime reading. Read at your own risk!

When you pick up a book about a forensic medical examiner, you'd better be ready for crime, deceit, and many grossly deceased bodies in various stages of decomposition. You won't be disappointed with "Fatal Voyage," Kathy Reich's latest Temperance Brennan title. Tons of twists and turns, lots of murders, and a continuing romantic plot. All in all, much more approachable and accessible than the Patricia Cornwell series with similar themes. Highly recommended.

I'm not big on short mystery stories, mainly because the plot seems to be either way too thin to offer much intrigue, or way too complicated to be packed into a few thousand words. I was pleasantly surprised with Murder Most Crafty. Most of the stories were meaty enough to offer some level of speculation regarding "whodunit," while not too complicated to follow. I found some old favorites, as well as some new authors to check out - and the craft projects were an added plus.

While I am growing to love Tess Gerritsen's work more and more, this book was less than her best. The usual Gerritsen trademarks are there -- a strong story line, good characters, multiple plots -- but something was missing. I felt that the author didn't pay enough attention to the nuances of the story and lost me as a reader as a result.When Dr. Claire Elliot flees Baltimore with her adolescent son, she thinks she's doing the best thing by relocating to Maine, hoping the new location will give her son a new lease on life in the wake of his father's death. Unfortunately, his juvenile problems (joy riding, hanging with the wrong crowd, etc.) follow the two to the ironically named Tranquility, Maine.The townsfolk are less than happy to welcome them, and a spate of rage in the town's teenagers is blamed on "outsiders" like the Elliots. Claire, however, senses a biological component behind the kids' behavior and has to buck the local powers-that-be in order to trace the violence to its pathological roots.While the plot is interesting, there were too many subplots, and as a result I felt that Claire was running off in too many different directions (as was the storyline). She often ignored her son's needs, and I found that hard to believe in many cases (she would leave him at home by himself, not follow up on problems at school, not confront the principal when he was blamed for conflicts, etc.).It's still a great read, despite the problems with the storyline.

I liked Yarn Harlot much better, but this is still a great book for fiber lovers everywhere. I think what confused me a bit was, is it a pattern book? A humor book? A memoir? There was a little bit of everything which could have been great but instead just frazzled my already-addled brain. I didn't know if I should read it straight-through or only refer to the sections I was interested in at that point in time. Oh, well... she's still darned funny.

The tough thing about reading books by comedians is that they seem to be missing something - the words need to be read aloud, not read silently in one's head. There is an element of that flatness in 700 Sundays, a memoir of Crystal's early years, but there's more than just a transcript of his monologues. Read between the jokes and you'll see the story of a family, from the great Uncle Berns to the sassy Aunt Sylvia, but most of all Crystal's nuclear family - his mom, dad, and the three sons.From Yankee Stadium to Long Beach, New York, Crystal tells the tales that shaped him as a child and young adult. Early comedy performances for the extended families, hanging out with jazz greats like Billie Holliday, and plenty of brisket and noodle kugel.Throughout it all is the poignancy of the early death of Crystal's father, and the hole he left behind.Part Patricia Volk, part Neil Simon, 100 percent Crystal.

A self-proclaimed cranky lady, Notaro takes on Stupid Hair, book tours, and more in this collection of essays. I enjoyed many of her rants (who can't identify with those "idiot" moments, like leaving your wallet in a taxi or locking yourself outside?). But after 100 pages, I got tired. Very, very tired. While she has an acerbic wit she doesn't hesitate to turn on anyone (including herself), Notaro has no finesse. Everything is a baseball bat, even when a fly swatter would do. By the end of the book, I felt like I'd spent four hours stuck in an elevator with Sam Kennison. Maybe as Notaro matures, she'll learn that she really is funny -- she doesn't need a blowhorn to tell us so.

If there is one book this year that has the potential to change my life, this is it. Weaver discusses the pull to accomplish more, more, more -- but shows how it actually separates us from God's purpose for us, and distracts us. Told with compassion and humor, this is truly a book for every "woman who does too much."

I shouldn't have expected much as I didn't fall in love with Buchan's previous "Revenge" book. But I was still disappointed with this novel.

Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, "Wow, this will fool 'em!" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery.

A book this raw deserves five stars, just for plain guts. But when you add in Rubin's way with words, her self-deprecation, and her humor, it makes me wish I could give her a few more.Anyone who's ever struggled with their weight, self-image, or food will relate to Rubin's tale of dieting, falling off the wagon, bingeing, and trying again. She speaks for everyone who's eaten too much and hated herself for not being able to zip up that "skinny" pair of jeans. Full of raw emotion, gut-wrenching honesty, and a good dose of humor, Rubin has written a story that the majority of women -- whether they have to lose 5 lbs. or 50 -- can relate to.I remember Rubin's columns in SHAPE and am so glad that she shared the stories behind the stories with everyone. I do wish she was a little more descriptive in the epilogue, though -- has she made it to a "healthy" weight? Is she happy? Has her obsession with food and weight decreased? I can only hope she'll write a sequel.

If you have an elementary-aged reader who wants to learn about other cultures, "Rickshaw Girl" is a terrific book. It tells the story of Naima, a young girl known for her painting skills, yet feeling powerless to help her family's finances (girls can't do anything but cook, clean, and decorate, she says!).To her surprise, a woman in a neighboring village has opened her own business -- painting rickshaws! Can Naima convince her family to let her become an apprentice to this forward-thinking woman?Told in easy-to-understand language with just enough foreign vocabulary (with a glossary, too), "Rickshaw Girl" will show young readers that even in the most desperate circumstances, everyone can contribute to a solution.

Bohjalian is too talented a writer to rely on something as inherently sensational as transgender relationships and sex change operations. He did approach the topic with something new to offer -- how the operation affects the people around the transexual. But he quickly devolves into the expected -- and butchers any chance he has of making a statement about the nature of sex and gender and relationships, and how gender can transcend the physical.The idea that a man could be handsome as a man and equally gorgeous as a woman is ludicrous -- as is the idea that a woman would "accept" that her ex-husband becomes involved with the man/woman she used to date. Add to that the fact that the voices of his characters all sound the same (even the college-aged girl sounds exactly the same as her mother).Bohjalian wrote this with a heavy hand, and in doing so lost any chance of creating a meaningful story.

I am a huge Leslie Caine fan, but this book left me baffled. There was simply too much happening, without enough context. Too many suspects, too many arguments, too many leads. And none of the characters was developed enough to make me connect with them or the story.I also find the insertion of random chapters of interior design advice to be an annoying interruption. They do nothing to further the story or the character development. They belong in an end-of-chapter summation, or an appendix -- not thrown randomly into the book. And the way they're done in a different typeface and design - horrid! I actually thought there'd been a mistake. The font is difficult to read and the design is ugly.Overall, not one of her best books, or even her best series. I love the lightheartedness that went with some of her earlier series, which is entirely missing in this series. There's nothing light about it -- just depressing.

Okay, I'm a sucker for a good sob story that pulls at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this didn't do it.

Confusing. Inconsistent. Boring. Not the best three adjectives in the world if you're looking for the next great read.After a terrific debut with "Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing" (which I loved), Bank came out with this...a series of short stories following the life and loves of Sophie Applebaum as she matures from an insecure pre-teen to an insecure teen, to -- guess what? -- an insecure adult.The problem is not Bank's writing, which is clear and filled with clever descriptions and turns-of-phrase. The problem is the subject matter. I never grew to know exactly who this person was, or why I should care about her. I cared more -- and was more interested by -- the minor characters than I was by Sophie herself, who I wanted to give a good slap and tell to grow up (you're going to get fired because you're always late to work? Why not buy an alarm clock?). And by jumping around in the chronology, skipping years and important events, I was lost.A disappointing followup to a wonderful first book.

The only part about Earlene Fowler's novels that I don't thoroughly enjoy is the end -- it always comes too soon! I fell into this, the latest in Fowler's Benni Harper series, head over heels and didn't emerge for days.Benni's investigating the death of a local society matron at the behest of her boss, Constance. In the meantime she must deal with a new installation at the art museum, puppysitting Hud's new corgi, and dealing with her visiting mother-in-law -- who has a mystery or two of her own up her sleeve.With "Tumbling Blocks," Fowler continues to reign supreme over the cozy mystery genre.

I so want to love Waldman's writing. She seems like such an interesting, intelligent woman. But instead, every book of hers that I read leaves me feeling vaguely annoyed. This was no exception.In this case, the storyline was certainly created to make the reader sympathetic to the protagonist. After losing her first child to SIDS, Emelia must deal with a too-smart-for-his-own-good five-year-old stepson and her husband's vicious ex-wife. The entanglements force Emelia to face her own beliefs about love and family ties.Instead of empathizing with her, I wanted to smack her. Emelia was so self-involved and unpleasant. There was just too much going on here. The "secret" about the baby's death. The stepmother thing. The "other woman" thing. The ex-wife. The father-daughter thing. And please, can we just get over Central Park??? For anyone who doesn't live in NYC (and there are millions of us), the allusions and references are lost.I didn't think it was a bad book, but it wasn't one I'd really recommend. For a more nuanced take on infant loss, try Jennifer Weiner's "Little Earthquakes."

We bought this DVD based on the idea that it would be an easy and fun way to learn conversational Italian. Big bummer! We watched over 1/2 an hour and at the end of the time didn't know a single word in Italian -- but we COULD tell you which letters are not innate to the Italian alphabet.Too much focus on the finer points of the language (the aforementioned alphabet issue as well as long, drawn-out sections on the difference in pronunciation of various vowels but no context in which to place them) and not enough on the nuts and bolts, like "Where's the bathroom?" "How much does that cost?" or even, "Do you speak English, please?"Also, I found the constant change of narrator to be quite confusing and even irritating.A good idea -- to make learning another language fun -- but it somehow got lost in translation (pun intended!). It doesn't make a difference if the tape is entertaining if it doesn't teach you anything of use!

Jonnie Jacobs' writing has gotten significantly more sophisticated since her first Kate Austen mystery more than a decade ago. With multiple plot turns, layered characters, and vivid descriptions, Witness for the Defense definitely holds its own. There are some issues with plotting (would a wealthy couple with money to burn really opt for a defense lawyer no one has ever heard of, and who handles adoptions as well as criminal defense? Is it a little too unlikely that several plot lines would be tied together so neatly?), but overall, the book kept me guessing on several fronts until the end. The final revelations were more than a little bit out of left field, but I'm willing to overlook them in favor of Jacobs' clear, compelling writing.

An exciting page-turner disguised as women's fiction. Psychotherapist Eric Lavender thinks his practice of bored Scarsdale housewives and personal life including two small children and a workaholic wife is boring, yet comfortable. Then his world falls apart as he's arrested for a horrific crime he didn't commit -- arreested at the hands of his once-devoted wife. As he digs deeper beneath her polished surface, everything Eric once held sacred begins to crumble.Excellent writing, perfect for lovers of Harlan Coben and Jonathan Kellerman.

I'll admit it, I was extremely skeptical when my husband brought this movie home. I'm unfamiliar with Martin Lawrence, and I hadn't seen the first Big Momma movie. But my doubts were soon put to rest and I joined the rest of my family in the silly, slapstick antics of Big Momma (why is a man dressed like a woman so much funnier than a woman dressed like a man???).Rare is the movie that you can watch with your kids without covering their ears every other scene. This movie was, for the most part, clean enough for my 8 and 6 year-olds to watch.While this wasn't "Mrs. Doubtfire" or "Tootsie," I will definitely be looking for the first Big Momma.

Nevada Barr has a way with words -- no doubt about that. But I'm not so sure that mysteries are her strength. The storyline in this book was compelling, but the number of plot holes and the confusion generated by the teeter-totter between points of views undercut the strength of the book. I lost the thread several times, and was constantly questioning Anna Pigeon's decisions (particularly the idea that once she captures the killer, she wouldn't just shoot him in the leg or lock him up instead of marching him out of the forest).The characters' actions served the author's needs, not the other way around.

In my experience, mystery series tend to get bogged down round about the twelfth book in the series. I'm happy to report that such is not the case with Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum.Things could get a little dull by the time you've made it through a dozen books, but Twelve Sharp is riddled with the humor, excitement, and lust that we've come to expect -- and love -- in a Stephanie Plum book. All the favorites are back (Grandma Mazur, Lula, Connie, Ranger, Joe and Bob) plus some new friends, and the antics are as wacky as ever.This book is sure to please the most devoted of Stephanie fans.

I picked this up at the library looking for information on podcasting... unfortunately, most software guides are outdated the moment they're put in print, and this was no exception.Podcasting wasn't even covered,but I thought there might be some basics that I could make use of. But the information on GarageBand basics was TOO basic -- and so outdated that it didn't even apply to my 2006 MacBook.I found the sidebars to be distracting and uninteresting (what was with all the ukelele information). There's got to be a better guide out there. I'll let you know when I find it.

I have to admit, if this series weren't about knitting, I probably wouldn't keep reading it. This book seemed to be the most poorly edited of the three so far -- several typos in the text, and errors in plot that should have been caught but weren't.Kelly and her friends just aren't real people to me -- more "Betty and Veronica," where they are two-dimensional, with no real depth or interest.The plot was slightly interesting but not all that compelling. Just didn't hook me (no pun intended). Still, as long as it's about knitting, I'll keep reading.

What could have been a dry "discovery of self" treatise or an oh-so-cute "Under the Italian/Indian/Indonesian Sun" pseudo-memoir becomes, in Gilbert's talented hands, an honest, self-deprecating, funny book. What struck me most was how different elements of Gilbert's personality came to the forefront in each locale... yet her own core shown through. A great testimony for the saying, "Wherever you go, there you are."

There are so many books out there that promise to help you find your path in life, to help you achieve meaning, that it's tough to know which one to read -- and which one will be different than the others.I've read scores of these types of books, and "The Purpose Driven Life" is different in several ways. First, it offers you a step-by-step plan for creating a sense of meaning in your life. Second, it's based in scripture. Third, it advocates making the church the center of your life.These differences can also be the book's drawbacks. I always sensed that the author had a bit of an agenda -- being a pastor of a huge church, of course he believes in the importance and sanctity of organized religion. But what if you aren't a member of a church? What if your church is dysfunctional? What if you feel called to do things outside your church?I for one believe that God has given us different talents and different strengths and different passions. SOME of us are called to serve in the church. And some of us are called elsewhere. Warren seems to ignore those of us who are pulled to serve others and use our talents outside of our church. After reading this book twice (once on my own and once through a small-group study through my church), I was still left with many, many questions -- and a deep-seated feeling that there was more to life than what Warren had presented.

I love the gothic elements of this entry in the Needlecraft Mysteries. Betsy and Jill head off for a "restful" vacation at a remote lodge, only to fall right into a mystery. Or is it just a product of Betsy's overactive imagination? The duo must rely on their wits and Betsy's unerring talent for ferreting out the truth to figure out what's going on.I like how Ferris continues to add new dimensions to her characters. Betsy struggles with her pull to solve mysteries while also dealing with the emotional aspects of solving crimes. Will she fight her nature to find peace of mind, or continue to help others find out the truth?One thing that bugs me is in the last few books, everyone (particularly Jill) seems to be too solicitous of Betsy. In the early books, this made sense, because her sister had just died. But now, c'mon! She's a grown woman and doesn't need someone "tucking her in" and telling her she looks tired and needs to rest every 15 pages. Let Betsy stand on her own two feet -- she (and the series) will be stronger for it!

Levitt is the professor that every student who's suffered through basic economics wishes they'd had. Instead of tackling dry topics, Levitt takes on the juicy stuff -- crack dealing, abortion, crime, and real estate agents, to name a few -- and discusses why people act the way they do.It was a bit tough to read this in only a few sittings... it seems to me to be more a collection of essays or articles than a "book," per se, but still, it was compelling, well-written, and accessible.Makes me want to pull out my old econ texts, dust them off, and try my hand at a little economic research.

I do love a good Elizabeth George mystery, but this one was just too darned long for me. If it had been more compelling, the length wouldn't have bothered me. But the fact that I figured out "whodunnit" in the first couple of chapters made the slog through the next 700 pages a little tedious.I also found myself getting lost in the timeline -- the storyline would move forward, then Gideon's writing would go back to the distant past as well as to a few days behind the rest of the story.Overall, it's well-written and well-plotted. Just a bit too fiberful for this reader.

I love thrillers, but I hate the type where every page is a blood bath, and the author focuses more on grossing out the reader than on trying to create a good story.That's why I am so happy to have discovered Tess Gerritsen. She offers a page-turner that actually has a plot that makes me want to keep reading.Body Double is one of my first Gerritsen books, but I wasn't hampered by the fact that I wasn't familiar with the characters. The author does a great job of making everyone accessible, while not giving TOO much backstory and boring the reader.Dr. Isley, otherwise known as the "Queen of the Dead," is a medical examiner with a cloudy background. Even she isn't too sure of where she came from as she was adopted as an infant. Her past catches up to her when a woman who could be her double is found shot outside her apartment. Isley must discover who this woman was, who killed her, and why she's next on the list.Full of twists and turns and enough mystery to keep you guessing until the end. Perfect blend of fear and excitement!

I bought this book as one of my first purchases as a new knitter. Unfortunately, there are a few basic patterns (mostly scarves) and then the book jumps to a much higher level of complexity. I would have liked to see more advanced-beginner patterns.All the same, this is a must-have book for any new knitter. Not only do you get a crash course on the history of knitting, you'll get introduced to some of the off-the-wall tricks and techniques that you won't find in any other beginning knitter book.After knitting for two years, I'm just getting to the point where I feel comfortable attempting some of the patterns, but I so enjoy this book! Not your grandma's knitting book, that's for sure.

Everyone loves the story of the poor little waif who's swept from obscurity and poverty into the lap of luxury. This book tells what happens after the rice from the wedding is swept away -- and Prince Charming turns back into a frog.Porter's book starts out well as Holly tries to come to terms with her divorce from the Prince, reinventing herself as a single woman-about-town in San Francisco. But about two-thirds of the way through the book, Porter seems to lose interest, summing up months of time in a paragraph or two. She never regains momentum, and the book lapses into diatribe after diatribe on the need for women to love themselves, the need for mothers to let their children go, and the need for men to see the "real" woman, not just the perfect makeup.What started out with a bang ended in a whimper.

How much is a woman willing to give -- or give up -- for love? That is the question at the center of this book. The tale of the three wives of a handsome sociopath, Mrs. Kimble traces the wreckage Ken Kimble leaves in his wake. Each woman is distinctly different, yet each is willing to sacrifice everything for the man she loves. While it is at times unavoidably depressing -- like watching a train smash into a car stalled on the tracks -- the resolution is, indeed, a tale of just rewards and redemption.The characters are finely drawn and all too real. The occasional plot clunker (Cohen's brother showing up on Dinah's doorstep???) keeps this from being a five-star novel. But I look forward to more books from Haigh in the future.

As a Christian, I read this book more as a source of comfort and inspiration than as a way to convince myself that heaven is real.I found Piper's style easy to read, and his overall story to be inspirational, but I felt like something was missing. Maybe because Piper worked with a co-author, but the whole experience seemed watered down. For something so life-changing and miraculous, it read in places as a mere recitation of the facts, rather than a deeply felt and tumultuous event that had far-reaching effects on numerous lives.I also found the timeline to be choppy -- it was hard to follow in places as it jumped forward and then back again, covering the same ground several times.I would have preferred a deeper exploration of how his accident and subsequent journey to heaven impacted his life and that of those around him - what changes did he make as a result of his experiences? How can he inspire readers to make changes in their own lives as a result of what he has gone through? Instead, a potentially powerful story is diluted and its impact lost.

I loved Anne Lamott's early work, but in the past years, her animosity and anger, coupled with her unapologetic self-absorption, had scared me off. I picked up this book with the understanding that Lamott had mellowed a bit, and I was happy to find that to be the case. There are still plenty of rants about the minutiae of her everyday life ("I'm breathing in! I'm breathing out!") but there are also some real gems here. If nothing else, she's brutally honest -- even about her own shortcomings.

Another great book by Katherine Hall Page. It was fun to read a "prequel" to the mysteries Faith Fairchild falls into in Aleford and see her as a young single woman. The mystery was compelling and full of twists and turns and vivid characters, just like the Aleford entries in the series. If Page writes more of these, I hope we get to witness the entrance of Tom on the scene. I'd love to read about their courtship!Fun and a quick read. One of the best in the series.

I usually shy away from diet-type books. After all, how great can any ONE be when there are thousands coming out every year??? But I loved the idea of being able to eat whatever I want, just by looking at the sizes of my portions. This book is a great primer to the idea that it's not WHAT you eat as much as it is how MUCH you eat.Young offers terrific real-world equivalents to help you get your chops around how many servings are in that Extra Value Meal. I am still a bit confused, though -- wish she had some additional info on how to really determine how much you need to eat, and some more translations of real menus into portion sizes. I would also love to see more success stories (love those before-and-afters!). All in all, I highly recommend this book. I checked it out from the library, but ended up marking so many pages to take notes from that I finally broke down and bought my own copy.

Anyone who's familiar with Wendy Knit's popular blog will know exactly what they're getting from this book. What disappointed me was the quality of the book, and the pattern choices. With the number of gorgeous, full-color knitting books on the store shelves, this one definitely pales in comparison. The photos of the finished objects are in black-and-white, and are so dark they're hard to see any detail. Add to that the fact that the patterns themselves are rather bland and blah, and you may want to think twice before purchasing this book. But if you love Wendy (and who doesn't??) go ahead. Then write to her publisher and tell her you want the next book to include color photos. I'd glady pay a few more bucks for a better-quality book.

Because it was being touted as a "modern-day 'Catcher in the Rye,'" I didn't think there was any way that this -- the first novel by Stephen Chbosky -- could live up to its billing. I was surpised to find that it far surpassed my expectations. The short book is written as a series of letters to an unnamed "friend," in which the protagonist, Charlie, shares the highs, lows, dreams, and disappontments of high school.Charlie is a misfit -- he's been kept back a year because of a nervous breakdown -- but he finds a niche with a group of edgy older teens. During the course of this school year, he finds that love doesn't wear just one face, that friends sometimes have to take a stand, and that the past has a way of coming back. Highly recommended.

I found the layout of the book to be nearly impossible to follow, and there are not pictures of every project so it's hard to figure out what the finished object will actually look like.Save your money.

It often seems that the only minority that's fair game for discrimination is the overweight. That fact is made uncomfortably clear in "Fat Girl: A True Story" by Judith Moore. Moore shares her life as an overweight, fatherless child -- a life that didn't get much better as she got older, and fatter. I found myself at times repulsed, at times weepingly sorry for her, at times amazed at her bravery. No pity party, though I do think Moore downplayed some of the more interesting elements of her life -- particularly in the area of her writing success and her romances. A gripping, appalling read.

Every time I go into the craft store with my 40 percent off coupon and see this book, I pick it up and leaf through it. But even at 40 percent off, there aren't enough interesting patterns in here to make it worth the cost.The patterns definitely aren't hip, unless perhaps you were born before the invention of aluminum needles and are unfamiliar with the Internet.Save your money -- you can do much better.

I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I feared it would be a little too "cutesy," especially with that awful cover. But I found Carmela, Childs' scrapbook store-owning protaganist, to have more of an edge to her than I expected.Still, the mystery was a little light, as other reviewers have mentioned, and there were some extraneous occurrences and absolutely strange goings-on, including characters (like Carmela's ex) who pop in for no apparent reason and then disappear again. But overall, Childs is a smooth writer who can, apparently, make a book from the slimmest of plots.

I was very disappointed in this book. There was never any clear discussion of what symptoms or characteristics one might use to classify their child as "explosive" other than one who throws a lot of violent fits. But there is a big difference between a "difficult" kid and one who is emotionally incapable of controlling him- or herself.Also, the book devolves quickly into doc-speak, bandying terms like "separation of affect," "working memory" and "shifting cognitive set" which had me seeing stars. It's almost like you need to be a psychologist to even begin to understand what the author is talking about.From the ratings, it appears that many others have found this book to be helpful. But it left me frustrated and confused.

I am baffled as to why Linda Barnes is not at the top of every mystery lover's list. Her character, Carlotta Carlyle, is like a blend of Kinsey Millhone and Stephanie Plum -- she's got chutzpah when it's needed, but there are some soft edges to her, too. Barnes' stories are impeccably plotted with just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end. And her writing is smooth and fresh."Deep Pockets," the tenth in the series, is as complete a mystery package as anyone could hope for. All the quirky characters from previous novels (Leroy, Paolina, Sam, Roz, and more) make their appearances, and we get to see Carlotta continue to wrestle with her never-ending attraction to Sam. The relationship between Carlotta and her adopted little sister, Paolina, also matures. I appreciate how Barnes keeps these relationships growing and changing instead of letting them stagnate as mere backdrops to the storyline.If you like Grafton, Paretsky, Muller, or Dunlap, try Barnes. You'll love her.

Who cannot relate to being "overstretched, overbooked, and about to snap?" As with his other books, Dr. Hallowell presents not only the problem (overcommitted, speeded-up lifestyles), but some practical solutions as well. I rolled my eyes along with the anecdotes he presents, completely identifying with his subjects. If you want to do something good for you and your family, read this book -- especially if you think you don't have time to.

I am certain it is difficult to walk the tightrope between simplifying America's favorite holiday and coming off as completely Scrooge-ish. Unfortunately, St. James definitely falls on the Dickensian side of this line. While the advice is sound (cut back on presents, don't say no when you want to say yes, figure out what you enjoy most), the majority of the book is written in a condescending tone that left this reader wondering when exactly St. James got bitten by the Grinch bug.I think part of the problem is that the book is written almost entirely with a secular philosophy. Missing is any sense of the true meaning of Christmas -- the Savior's birth. Instead, we're treated to St. James' decidedly PC philosophical musings. That would be fine in a book that doesn't deal with a religiously themed holiday, but in this case, it just seems sad.While I'm making a list of my favorite and least favorite traditions (hints #1 and #2), I think I'll forgo most of the other 98 suggestions and instead try to bring the focus back to Jesus. Everything else will fall in place from there.

As usual, I agree with most of what Dr. Laura says, though I don't always agree on the delivery. This book was pretty light on the info, I felt, though the recommendations are sound. Basically, if you had a bad childhood, "GET OVER IT." This may be helpful to some who haven't moved on and continue dwelling on the past, but I'm not sure it took a whole book to say that.

Rare is the book that captures me so completely that I cannot bear to put it down. This is one of those books.Niffenegger makes Henry's malady -- chrono-displacement -- so real and totally in keeping with his character -- the reader cannot imagine him any other way. He and Clare, and the relationship between them, is so true that the reader feels for them as the novel winds toward its inevitable conclusion.The author masterfully traces both Clare's and Henry's character development, never losing momentum or narrative thread as the story moves forward and backward in time.This book is a masterpiece about love, loss, and the spaces between us that can exist -- or be filled -- no matter how close or far apart we are.

Some have called this tale of a post-apocalypse world hopeless -- but I completely disagree. I think the story of a man and his son traveling through a burned-out, desolate landscape in the hopes of a better tomorrow the very defnition of hope.The love between the two is simple and pure, nothing more or less than the love between parent and child. The writing is stripped to the very core -- not even punctuation clutters the sparseness. But it is rich all the same. And unforgettable.I will carry this book with me in my heart for a long time.

This was the first Needlecraft Mystery that I figured out before the book was halfway done. While it's still well-written and entertaining, I did find it a bit transparent (and, at the same time, confusing!). There were a lot of new characters introduced, and I had trouble keeping them and their stories straight. All the same, a great read.

Ann Pleshette Murphy turns her vast skills as a mother (of two) and writer (former editor of Parenting magazine) into this filled-to-the-brim book. In a refreshing take on parenting tomes, Murphy focuses on the mother instead of on the child.I found the early sections to be full of "oh my gosh, I can relate" moments as I laughed and nodded along with Murphy's personal tales as well as the anecdotes from hundreds of women, and I made mental notes of her suggestions in the sections for parents of older kids.My biggest complaint is that because the book is divided by age, two-thirds of it did not apply to me, and would apply to women only at certain times in their lives. I would have liked to see her divide this book into several different volumes, each addressing a different age group. That way you could read about what you're going through and what immediately awaits you, but save the discussions about teens and tweens (in my case) for later years when they're more applicable.Another complaint was that while Murphy had no problems addressing homosexual relationships in teenagers, noticeably absent was any discussion of religion or spirituality for kids (or parents).I really believe that spirituality/faith is such a crucial part of parenting, that I cannot imagine writing a book without including any mention of these topics. I felt that Murphy became a bit too "PC" in addressing the issues facing older kids.Nonetheless, this is one of the few books I've read that have discusses what moms go through at different ages of their children. Though I probably won't pick it up again when my kids are older (who has time for re-reading books??), I will take some of her recommendations to heart.

I'm very hesitant to write this review. Why? Because I am a huge fan of both Dr. Phil and Robin McGraw. I admire them both tremendously, and think both offer a needed dose of common sense and compassion in a "do what feels good" world.However, my admiration doesn't help my opinion of this book. In fact, it may hurt it -- I expected so much!I find that I learn more from people's struggles and failures than from their successes. And this book was loaded with the latter and didn't hold too many of the former. I wasn't sure how to take McGraw's advice... apparently she's never had a moment of self-doubt or lack of confidence in her life. For someone like me -- who questions everything from what clothes I put on in the morning to the direction of my life -- her "This is what I do and it works great!" advice doesn't help much. In fact, I ended the book feeling worse about myself than when I had started.I don't think that was her intention at all, and I did enjoy reading more about her life with Dr. Phil. But I would have enjoyed even more hearing about her own experiences with questioning her path, times when she was unhappy and unsure of herself, and times when she didn't feel 100 percent loved -- and loveable. Maybe in Volume II.

I couldn't believe it when I saw the price on this book. Similar books go for as much as twice what this one is listed at! And the patterns are whimsical, fun, creative... My daughter is dying for the mermaid outfit, and I've already knit the backpack for her. Some patterns (like the crowns) are a little silly (why knit them for oodles of money and time when you can simply make them out of paper and let your kids decorate them themselves?), but overall, this book provides a great assortment of fun, interesting choices.

I've been interested in handwriting analysis since I was in my teen years, but I've found so many of the books on the topic to read like dry, boring textbooks. Not so with Michelle Dresbold's book. From the first page, Dresbold grabs the readers and entertains while instructing. I read the entire book in one day because I was so enthralled with her examples, her writing, and her information.I particularly liked the structure of the book, how she moved from some general information into more specific examples of analysis. And I felt like after finishing the book, I had a good enough grasp to begin a very rough analysis of the handwriting of those around me (hopefully we won't see any felon's hooks or pugilistic p's).

I am only on page 14, but I already know that this book is going to change my life. Geneen has an against-the-grain look at dieting, weight loss and cultural expectations of women, and has already made me question the way I treat my appetites and my body. I am looking forward to reading the rest of this book.

This book left me befuddled. What was the point? I was expecting thoughtful essays about the meaning of life, as filtered through the experiences of the author, a psychiatrist. Instead, the book had little more depth than a sixth grader's "What I did On My Summer Vacation" essay. I was amazed when Rako spent more time on watching her granddaughter feed birds than she did on the breakup of either of her marrriages.It's a disappointment because Rako's life seems to be a full and vivid one, but little of that wholeness and color made it onto the page. I finished knowing more about her mentor than I did about her.

Elizabeth George is, in my opinion, the standard by which all English detective novels are measured. This -- one of her early books -- is as finely plotted and written as any in the Lynley-Havers series.Lynley is asked to investigate a missing child at a private school, and he and Havers are thrust into a world of lies, intrigue, and twisted passions, thinly veiled in upper-class civility.Everyone has a secret, and Lynley is charged with unraveling the web of lies that threatens to destroy more than one life The resolution is full of twists, turns, and surprises.

How many times have I read this book? Three? Four? Five??? In any case, it never fails to enthrall me.Davidson does such an excellent job of pulling the reader into the world of Aspen Meadows and Goldy Schultz. I read the books as much for the characters as for the mystery, and I'm never disappointed. This volume has a strong plot and great characterization.Vintage Davidson. Don't miss it.

Cute collection of Christmas tales (which I'm a sucker for!). Not your typical saccharine-sweet fare. Instead there's a murder mystery, an alien invasion, and more.Willis is a great writer but often I felt thrust into the story with no idea of who the characters were. Just a little description (physical, age, temperament) would have helped distinguish them in my mind. Instead, many seemed interchangeable.All the same, it was a fun and quick read.

I disliked this book so much that every time I see it on the library shelves, I'm tempted to hide it behind the stacks so no one else will have to suffer through it.The problem for me was not the writing -- it was that I didn't care for a single character in the entire book. The murder was almost incidental, the trip to Disney World seemed so incongruous that it came across as an attempt by the author to justify her family's vacation as "research," and therefore a tax write-off.The thing the author should realize is that when someone as unlikeable as this victim gets killed, no one really CARES who did it. They just shout "Hurray!" and move on.

Anyone who has three books going at the same time, who hates the thought of constraining him- or herself to just one "thing," or who gets swallowed up for hours in a bookstore will find themselves in this book.Lobenstine does an excellent job of describing the "renaissance" personality and helping people who fall in this category to accept and embrace their "diagnosis." She offers concrete ways of working with -- instead of against -- our personality traits.I love feeling like I'm not alone, and I appreciated some of the concrete suggestions, but I finished this book feeling a little lost as to what my next steps should be. How do I select my four (or five) focal areas when it's nearly impossible for me to choose ANYTHING? I would have appreciated a more structured approach to winnowing -- rather than narrowing -- my choices.Overall, though, full of tons of great inspiration, if a little light on the practical side.

Is there an unforgiveable sin? If so, what is it, and if you choose not to forgive a transgression, who is punished more -- the sinner or the victim? In this sensitive portrayal of friendship and loss, Leah Stewart investigates the many facets of friendship, the question of how much you can truly know someone, and how we can never truly protect ourselves from pain, no matter how hard we try.For the most part, I thought this book was extremely well-written, though the plot was a bit far-fetched. Her characters were vivid and alive, and very believable -- so believable that I was willing to overlook the way-too-coincidental elements.A fascinating, provocative look at friendship.

Jonathan Kellerman has set the bar for psychological thrillers, and he's set it high. Unfortunately, Obsession, the latest in the Alex Delaware series, falls short of his previous achievements.While the usual elements are there -- a previous client needs help, and Delaware and his detective pal Milo Sturgis jump to the rescue -- things feel a bit stale. Everything is just a bit tepid. Their reason for becoming involved in the mystery (a dying request from Sturgis' lover's co-worker) is tenuous at best. Because there is no immediate crime to investigate, just the suspicion of one, things start off slow. And the character development seems to stagnate. Robin, Delaware's live-in love, is a mere two-dimensional place holder with no personality of her own, and nothing new about Delaware's or Sturgis' personalities is revealed.The young girl they're interceding on behalf of is annoying and simple (does this college-aged girl REALLY call her mother "Mommy" ALL the time???). I wanted her to be guilty of something, just because she bugged me so much. Bad news when the reader is cheering for culpability on the part of the who's supposed to be protected.All in all, a decently plotted and written mystery, but that spark of excitement and frisson of fear that accompanies most of Kellerman's books is missing.

Nothing unusual here: It's a typical tale of three sisters -- one pretty and elegant, one cute and young, and the third stuck in the middle. It's got it all -- a stolen fiance, philandering spouses, torrid love affairs, an early death, and a meddling but loveable granny. This book won't change your life, but it's sweet and gentle, and it is the perfect accompaniment for a long plane ride (perhaps to Sydney?) or a beach weekend.

There's no doubt that Donna Andrews is a talented writer. I did enjoy this book -- the third in her Meg Langslow mystery series. There were several bright points that made me smile, but I did not get the "laugh a page" that the cover blurbs promised.Andrews' ability to craft language and to create unique scenarios will win her a place on my shelf, but there were some problems with this book. The characters were not introduced sufficiently to win over new readers. What does Meg look like? How old is she? We are TOLD that her family is crazy, but I want to SEE that more.I felt too much like I was coming in on Act II of the play, and felt left out of the jokes. Yes, I did skip books 1 and 2, but new readers to a series should always feel welcome, not as if they're intruders.

Hands-down, this is the absolute best Halloween book for young children. We bought this when it first came out in 1997, and it still has an honored spot on our shelves. Every year, we pull it out and revel in the fanciful pictures, catchy rhymes, and joy of the season.We started reading this when my son was only a few months old, and now that he's almost 9, it's still a favorite -- and our younger two kids love it just as much. Don't miss this book!

This book was on my son's summer reading list, and I had to take a look. I was impressed with all that was packed into this book in a way that pre-adolescents can absorb and understand. Although the topics were tough -- a mother who leaves her young daughter as she searches for herself, and a grandparent's death, among others -- Creech treated the subjects with a fair amount of humor. This book reminded me of "Where the Heart Is" by Billie Letts. Very enjoyable, well-written, and funny -- with a lot of meat for discussion.

No doubt that Noble can write! While she could easily succumb to the chick lit phenom and write half-baked, "Sex and the City"-type book. But instead, she gives real thought to the characters, their own backstories, and how they interact. The main three characters are complete, with issues and problems of their own.The complaints I have are:1. Things wrapped up a bit too neatly. I would have liked to see a little more change and friction instead of a "they all lived happily ever after" end.2. Freddie is supposed to be American, but she uses turns of phrases that NO American would use. Same for some of the dialog when the story moves to Massachusetts. Noble should have had an American editor read through for these slips that really distracted me.3. With all the talk about "The Friendship Test," I think they would have applied the test to all the women in the book they encountered -- including Rebecca and Grace. I was very interested to see how they stacked up.Still, a great book that was a fun read.

I do not watch TV, so I was not familiar with her work on "The Starting Over House" until I read this book. I had caught the show once or twice while traveling, so I quickly made the connection between the life coach I'd seen, and the author. Rhonda writes in a personal, easy-to-read style that makes her readers feel like she's sitting down with them over a skinny latte at the local Starbucks. She puts up no pretensions, and readily shares her less-than-glamorous personal history and struggles.The strengths of this book are Rhonda's approachability and sound advice. Where it falls a bit short is I feel it tries to do too much at once. Rhonda's personal struggles are interspersed with those of the participants in The Starting Over House and the women who shared their feelings about their bodies for the photos at the beginning of each chapter. I think the book would have been stronger if she had stuck to one approach -- just her own stories, or just those of the clients she's helped. Instead, I felt a little like a pingpong ball, zipping between one story here and Rhonda's story there.All that said, Rhonda's message is simple and clear: You can live in the NOW, or you can put off your "real life" until you lose five, ten, fifteen, or more pounds. The life in that future time is less important than your life in the here and now, so you may as well get moving.Thank you, Rhonda, for sharing your story so honestly. You will help a lot of people.

The premise of this book had me from "go." A double-income-two-kid couple is in search of a new nanny, and Randi seems to be the answer to their prayers. But as she becomes more and more indispensable, the Cook-Goldman marriage begins to unravel at the edges. Is Randi a willing participant to the family's demise, or just an unwitting bystander? The larger story is about secrets and the things we know but don't admit, even to ourselves.I'm all for authors keeping a light touch, but seriously... this book had way too much subtext for me. I felt like there was so much going on under the surface that I was missing, and not enough action and explicaation on the page. I foun dmyself re-reading passages, wondering if I'd missed something (the scene at the fireworks was a great example of reader confusion).Great theme, easy to read, but I felt like I read a whole book without figuring out what was really going on.

There is much to love and admire about this book: the author's heart-wrenching take on mothering an autistic child, vivid characters, smooth writing... but there is also much to take issue with.I am not the mother of an autistic child, so the criticisms I have will likely seem minor to a woman who is crying tears of relief that she is reading about her life in a book. So, that said...In marked contrast to her ability to portray Daniel and the agony his mother is going through with such poignancy, Leimbach fails to create a believable main character in Melanie, and likewise in her husband, Stephen.Stephen turns from good guy/Prince Charming to Ogre overnight, with no foreshadowing of the personality switch. I was downright shocked when he disappeared and then became such a jerk. And in the last few pages of the book we learn that he's ALWAYS been this way... though we have never seen any hint of it before he turns tail and deserts his family. I almost felt like the author had originally written the book to end one way, and then decided at the last minute to switch the ending and had to scramble to make it work.I found the timeline disconcerting. We appeared to be jumping forward then backward then forward again, with no sense as to the progression of time. I needed a more linear timeline, or at least some signposts along the way to tell me how time was passing.Finally, the book felt unfinished to me. Melanie has a new love -- bully for her! But what about Daniel? He was the one I really wanted to hear about. Melanie's transformation seemed to focus more on her ability to score a new man than on her coming to terms with her son's disabilities. I also felt that many of the bit players were merely devices for plot ("Oh, I need someone to watch the children so Melanie can sneak out at night! I'd better have Veena the housekeeper show up on her doorstep and move in." or "Oh, how will Melanie learn more about autism than what's in the books? I know! I'll have her run into a woman in the grocery store!")Overall, I thought parts of the book were excellent. But many parts were not. I would love to have loved this book -- the potential was there.

When Sister John of the Cross realizes her spiritual visions -- which have come after years of doubting her vocation -- are a result of epilepsy, she must decide whether to treat the condition and possibly lose her close relationship with God, or refuse treatment and risk her life.In this spare novel, Salzman digs deep into questions of faith, humanity, sisterhood, and religious sacrifice. With not an extra word he addresses Sister John's dilemma. The reader doesn't know until the very end what Sister John will decide, and what the results will be.A wonderful look at the true meaning of faith.

Let me start by saying I'm not a dog owner. I'm not even particularly an animal lover -- or even liker. But I had to read this book just to keep pace with the rest of the American culture. And I am glad I did.Grogan paints a picture of his family's relationship with his incorrigible curr, Marley, that goes beyond mere pet ownership. Through trials and tribulations, Marley forges an irrevocable place in the hearts of the Grogan family the same way he ripped through their carpet, floors, drywalls, and socks. You couldn't help but love this incredible dog that seemed to be more angel than canine in a furry body.Anyone who's ever owned a dog and felt that indelible paw mark on his or her heart will identify with Grogan, and I challenge even the most dedicated dog disliker to read the final chapters without shedding a tear -- or a bucketful.

Written by one of Disney's Teachers of the Year (why are they always men??), this book is a must-read for anyone who has kids, teaches, or pays taxes to fund public schools.After spending decades teaching in one of the worst areas in the country, Esquith has devised a method to help his kids come out on par with the "rich kids" from across town. His secret: There are no shortcuts. Work harder, work longer, be nice, and do your best.Esquith expands on his experiences with tons of recommendations, horror stories, and tales from his own classroom. After I finished this book, I wanted to write the man a check. I still will -- after I make my husband read this and buy a copy for all of my kids' teachers.

Over the past few years, there have been some standouts dealing with women rediscovering themselves. Lolly Winston's "Good Grief" comes immediately to mind, as does Sue Monk Kidd's "The Mermaid Chair." Going back a bit further, Berg's own "Pull of the Moon" is a classic in its descriptive realism -- one of the author's many strengths.Unfortunately, "Year of Pleasures" comes nowhere close to Berg's best. It is shallow, even with its topic -- the death of a spouse. It is unbelievable, even with its thousands of details (the reader is almost overwhelmed with memories, thoughts, and feelings, all of which Berg seems compelled to dump on the page). It is disjointed and, to me, an unfinished work.I just don't buy the characters, their development, or the way they're all thrown together -- and then abandoned like so many Barbie dolls that Berg got tired of manipulating. Not worth the read. Opt for one of her others, like "The Art of Mending" or "Open House." It was a relief to be done with this book.

Told in a straightforward and vivid manner, Breath, Eyes, Memory tells the story of Sophie as she leaves Haiti and her aunt, the only home and mother she's known. Summoned to New York by her mother, Sophie must learn how to get along in this foreign land with a woman she barely remembers.Through her own experiences, Sophie learns to appreciate the bonds of strength and nightmare that she shares with generations of Haitian women, choosing what to keep and pass on to her own daughter, and what to abandon. A quick read, but one that will change my perceptions of motherhood and sisterhood forever.

Part science fiction, part cultural criticism, "Never Let Me Go" is a novel of love and friendship between three young adults raised in modern-day England. Victims of a society whose scientific advances have moved faster than its ability to address the resulting changes in an ethical and conscientious manner, the three share a lifetime bond that must end much too soon.This book reminded me of Margaret Atwood's "Handmaid's Tale" in its eerie realism, but without the growing tension. While many of the characters are superbly crafted, and the environment in which the children are raised is incredibly detailed, I was still left wanting more... more resolution, more outrage, more tension, more passion, more SOMETHING.Still, Ishiguro is a master and this book is worth reading, if only for the questions he raises about our ability to deal humanely with the scientific advances we're on the brink of adopting into mainstream culture.

This book wasn't what I expected from the title -- it was more about Esme educating the school and administrators than about her getting "broken in." All the same, I loved her creativity and enthusiasm, and the way she shared her shortcomings as well as her successes made the book even more inspiring.The book was short, concise, easy to read, and fun. It should be required reading for all teachers and parents. Esme Codell is the teacher you wish your kids would have.

Marti Leimbach is a witty, entertaining writer -- the kind of person you'd like to be sitting next to on your next trans-Atlantic flight. "Love and Houses" has some compelling characters to give a unique spin on this timeworn topic, but there's no "there," there. The book lacked substance, and I could never forget I was reading the product of someone's imagination. Still, worth a read for the quirky characters and great humor.

Oh China, what has happened to you?You've gone from an interesting, three-dimensional character to a busybody who somehow ramrods her agenda down everyone's throats.The plot of this book wasn't half-bad (though the various drug agencies had me confounded), but China's attempts at mystery solving (telling the chief of police what she'll do and what she won't, inserting herself in investigations, giving a possible killer her home address???) were baffling. I am all for suspension of disbelief, but this was ridiculous.Bring back the old China. Please!

The first time I picked up this book, I was a newbie knitter. I flipped through it and thought, "Nnnnh. No patterns. Pretty pictures." And then I set it back on the shelf. Fast-forward three years. NOW, as a self-admitted fiber addict, I looked at -- and read -- this book with a new eye. I loved the vintage knitting pictures, adored the essays, and truly enjoyed the whole package. If you love yarn and knitting, you'll love this book. It weds intelligent, emotional writing about knitting with awesome images.

There are so many things to love about this book -- a wonderful, heart-wrenching story. Vivid characters. A unique setting (when's the last time you read a book set in Wisconsin??). Mitchard -- an extremely talented writer -- hit many high notes with this, her latest work.However, she hit some real clunkers, too. The characters are so truly and vividly drawn that anything OUT of character stands out like a sore thumb. I had trouble reconciling the snobby Julie of her childhood with the supposedly snobby adult -- coupled with her career as an advice columnist. I NEVER liked Leo, and I would have liked to feel some sympathy for him at some point. And Kathy seemed a little too convenient.The alternating chapters/alternating voices thing usually doesn't work for me. It seems a lazy way for a writer to give us insights into different characters. I also found the timing and sequencing to be confusing -- one step forward, one to the side, two back, one forward again. I couldn't figure out where in the timeline we were with each subsequent chapter.Despite these complaints, I loved this book. It touched me -- something fiction rarely seems to do anymore. One recommendation: Don't listen to it on CD. Anna Fields, the narrator, was annoying beyond belief.

I've read most of Marian Keyes' books, and while I've enjoyed most of them, this one stands out as one of my favorites.The interconnected story of three thirty-something women in Great Britain as they search for love, fulfillment, and successful careers, was spot-on in so many aspects. Yes, there were enough happy endings to go around, and yes, this could be called "chick lit," but it was far from cookie-cutter. Jojo, Lily and Gemma were all sympathetic characters in their own way, and I found myself rooting for all of them, even as their successes seemed to be mutually exclusive.Lots of laughs and clever writing, "The Other Side of the Story" will keep you up at night as you read page after page, just to see how it all turns out.

While nothing in the book was a huge revelation ("your kids model themselves after you," "take care of yourself," "take care of your marriage," etc.), it was all a good reminder -- and it was nice to have the Biblical citations to back up the principles.

Another flawless Marcia Muller mystery with the perfect blend of personal life and mystery. This entry in the Sharon McCone series offers a deeper look into McCone's past, including some earthshattering news she discovers after the death of her father.I like how Muller's books further every facet of her characters' personalities, instead of ignoring the personal in favor of the professional (a la Sue Grafton's latest books) or vice versa (as many of the "cozies" do).Great plotting, seamless storyline, great, unique characters. A terrific book as either a standalone mystery or an entry in the series.

I am a little confused as to why Weiner, one of the hottest writers today, felt it necessary to try her hand at a mystery. After the raucous success of "In Her Shoes," "Good In Bed," and "Little Earthquakes," I expected her to keep moving on the same vein -- and I was excited about it.But this book doesn't make the grade set by her previous three best-sellers. The mystery is clunky, the characters annoying, and the plot disjointed. This was a strange attempt at a new genre. Let's hope Weiner returns to her familiar -- and lush -- territory and leaves the mystery writing to others.

The tough thing about tech books is that they are out-of-date as soon as they make it to print. While this book gives a great overview of the origins of podcasting and the different technologies that lie behind the craze, it's almost a history book now. With the advent of GarageBand (which isn't even mentioned in the book) and free podcast hosting sites, information about the ins and outs and nuts and bolts of RSS and FTP upload sites is woefully archaic -- and unnecessary.Still, it's a great overview for the geeks out there who want to know everything from the ground-up. And Cochrane's writing is entertaining, light, and self-deprecating. I look forward to an updated version soon.

For a book that is supposed to be about radical marketing, I am not sure why this one had such a conservative world view -- or why the "experts" quoted were from the traditionally strong marketing establishment like P&G.; What do I really care what a P&G; brand manager/VP has to say about how Harley markets?Much too tame, staid, and academic to be of much interest.

Betsy Devonshire must solve the decades-old murder of a mystery woman that appears to be entangled with the present-day murder of one of her friend's ex-husband. Twists abound, and while Betsy is keeping track of suspects, she also must juggle dealing with her new business and closing on her sister's estate. Lots of needle-y fun that even the uninitiated will enjoy. While it wasn't the most enthralling book I've ever read, it was a decent enough mystery -- and I'm picky about my mysteries!

Tons of great info in this book, but they need someone like the Freakonomics guys or Malcolm Gladwell to make it a little more appealing to the mass market. I know they sold millions of this title, but I wonder how many people actually made it all the way through?Here's what I learned:1. Standard of living/spending does not equal wealth2. Those who look like they're millionaires usually are not3. Don't give cash to your kids to support a lifestyle they cannot support on their own4. Buy used cars!5. Live below your meansAll great tips. All things I hope to put into practice. But I had to wade through many dry-as-a-Thanksgiving-turkey chapters and charts that to me weren't where the real meat (no pun intended!) was. All the same, a worthwhile book.

If you can overlook some clunkers of plot, this story of a psychiatrist bent on redeeming her reputation and her life by helping bring a "wild child" to civilization will capture you. Not only is there the mystery of who Alice is and how she came to be virtually raised by wolves, there's also the story of what makes a family and how we create community.Not the most believable tale in the world, but a heck of a lot better-written than many titles on the best-seller list (Mary Higgins Clark, anyone??).

Not until the final 50 pages of the book does the reader find out what the title means -- and not until slightly before that does the story really take off.I'm a fan of Keyes, listing Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, and Last Chance Saloon as some of the brightest titles in the Chick Lit universe. But this book was so slow, so sleepy, that it took me nearly a month to read it.Pick it up if you've read all her other books and can't wait for a new title. All in all, it's not vintage Keyes. But you could do a lot worse.

Monica Ferris is doing a great job of keeping this series fresh. It could get old quickly, with the troubles Betsy faces as a new-ish needlecrafter and a newer business owner. But I really enjoy how her characters continue to flesh out, and how Ferris disproves the "Minnesota Nice" by giving her recurring characters edges. Not everyone is sweet and simple -- they have prejudices, challenges, and troubles of their own.In this "episode," Betsy is taken to task for employing a "known" murderer. She lashes back at the Monday Bunch and sets out to prove what happened, once and for all, in a five-year-old double murder.The resolution is unique and the book kept my attention all the way through. Criticisms -- by taking on a five-year-old murder, in which she knew neither of the victims and isn't particularly well acquainted with the accused, Betsy loses some of our interest. Why should we really care about this couple, or Foster Johns? In the previous books, the need to find out "what really happened" was more critical. But all in all, a well-written addition to the series.

This book was just what I was looking for -- straight, yet light-hearted, talk on how to translate what I'm reading in my devotional time into actions in my life. Lysa Ter Keurst is simply amazing! Reading this book was like sitting down for a cup of coffee with a dear friend, who doesn't hold back with the straight talk, but who also shows you her own life, warts and all.Filled with practical advice, this book left me with a deep desire to open myself up to Jesus more and more -- and showed me how to do it, too. Thank you, Lysa! I'll be recommending this book to my Bible study group.

Every time I read a book by Harlan Coben, I say "This is the best book I've ever read!" And it's true -- until the next Coben novel comes along.In "Promise Me," Coben writes the return of his flagship character, Myron Bolitar. And Bolitar brings with him all the characters and craziness we've become used to -- Big Chief Mama, Win, Zorra, and more.As usual, the plot is impeccably arranged, unexpected without becoming erratic, and peppered with the wittiness and humor fans of Bolitar have come to expect.Don't miss this.

Finally -- a designer has recognized the need to provide cute, functional projects that can make use of all the odds and ends sitting in knitters' stashes! There are several projects in this book that I'm itching to get started on. And it's an added bonus knowing I'm using up "leftover" yarn to make them!

It's hard to review this book when I am so appalled at what it represents. I appreciate the author's attempt to get into the whys and wherefores of teenage mass murderers, but I'm not sure the book deserves the attention it's gotten. While it definitely presents the story behind one such (fictional) criminal, I don't believe that Kevin's story is every school shooter's story.I think the relationship between mother and son (a son trying desperately to get a reaction from a mother who not only was ambivalent about his birth, but doesn't like him as a child either) is overshadowed by the horrific detals of the larger story. The nuances of the relationship -- and the truths about how far a child will go to gain his parents' attention -- are lost in the carnage.A sidenote on the writing -- I dislike having to work so hard to read a book. I have trouble believing that an ordinary reader made it through this novel without a dictionary in hand. What's with the convoluted sentence structure and made-up words, and why did the author insist on using phrases such as "lambent joy," ""immediate rapacities," and "alien argot?" And this, from a woman who supposedly wrote travel guides aimed at the average college student? I think not.All in all, a gripping story, but the sensationalism of the crime obscures the deeper, more accessible meaning.

The lightest of McCourt's three memoirs, "Teacher Man" picks up where "'Tis" left off, as the author embarks on his teaching career in the public high schools of New York City.McCourt pulls no punches in his recollections, taking on the school adminstration, B-class writers he bumps into on the outskirts of the City's literary circles, blue-collar parents of his students, and himself. We respect his criticisms of others because he turns the same pink-rimmed eye to his own foibles and errors, whether it be infidelities, inability to complete his doctoral thesis, or lack of knowledge about how to teach.Over thirty years, McCourt becomes the teacher he always wished he could be -- himself, yet the best self he has to offer his students. And they love him for it. And I loved this book. God bless Frank McCourt. May he live many more quirky years, and may he have the energy to write about them.

Let's leave aside the total impracticality of someone making enough cash off pirated knitting patterns to make it worth killing for... and we'll leave aside the use of "Omigosh" about a dozen times in the first chapter... and we'll forget about the use of everyone's name each time they're spoken to (how often do YOU use your friend's name while in conversation with them?)...The book is still not so great. The plot was transparent, the characters were wonky and wooden, and the whole thing was poorly plotted and choppy.That said, I'll still probably read the rest in the series because it's about knitting, and I'm a sucker like that.

You know how you sometimes go to those action movies ("guy flicks") and from the moment you sit back in your seat until the closing credits 90 minutes later, you are assaulted by car chase after car chase, explosion after explosion, and you have no idea where to look first or what's really going on? That is how I felt reading "Club Dead."I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but I seriously had no clue where the plot line was -- or if there even was one. Yes, there was a ton of action, but it was enough for three or four books instead of just one. And the motivations about what was going on was never really explained.A lot happened in this book, but I'm not really sure what it was -- or why it occurred. Too bad, as I really enjoy the characters, and Harris has a great way with words.

I was a little reluctant to read this book, the first that Fowler's published outside her popular "Benni Harper" series. What if I didn't love it as much as the mysteries? What if I was sorely disappointed??I need not have feared. "Saddlemaker's Wife" continues the wonderful tradition of making the people of the West come alive. The characters are real, different, compelling -- and there's even a mystery involved! I also love how Fowler incorporates her spirituality as a natural, organic part of the storyline, not as something she forced.The other thing I have to mention about Fowler's writing, and this book in particular, is the way she uses the multiple-POV. I usually hate books that switch POV each chapter -- it seems like a way to get out of the hard work of writing. Not so with Fowler; I don't even notice the POV change, it works so well.A must-read.

Waldman can write -- no doubt about that. But her plotting with this book in particular left me confused and unsatisfied. And the motivations behind her protagonist's actions are also a bit sketchy.There were too many loose ends here and not enough beef... Characters are introduced and then conveniently manipulated, killed off, or abandoned. The sub-plot about Juliet's husband and his lawsuit also seems a bit too convenient -- merely a chance for Juliet to redeem herself in his eyes.I'd like to see something with more "oomph" and a little less carefully-scripted-plot-designed-to-show-how-bad-the-establishment-is.

My least favorite of the Faith Fairchild books so far -- mainly because Faith was barely in it! Though I do like Pix, I don't think I know enough about her (or her mother) to care that the fiance of the granddaughter of an old friend of her mother's has died, and the granddaughter has disappeared. Certainly, I didn't care enough to sustain my interest the whole book. Also, the sidenotes and stream-of-consciousness writing that is quirky and appealing in the Faith books got way out of line here. I found myself reading and re-reading passages, trying to figure out who was who and what was what.It's still a decent read, and much better than many of the books out there, but I definitely prefer the Faith-based books (no pun intended!).

Is it possible to be so lonely in a marriage that you feel LESS lonely when your partner is gone? And is it possible to hide the most basic facts of your existence from your friends and family?The answer to these questions, according to Nina Solomon's "The Single Wife," is a resounding affirmative. Grace Brookman, Solomon's main character, has become somewhat accustomed to her husband's unusual comings and goings, so she automatically attempts to cover for him when he disappears in the wake of a scandal that is poised to destroy his career.Grace puts up a good front, fooling almost everyone, and along the way discovers how lonely she's been -- and who her true friends are. Compelling characters and a unique premise make this "not your ordinary chicklit." Highly recommended.An interesting take on friendship, marriage, and loneliness. If you enjoyed "The Time Traveler's Wife," you'll like "The Single Wife."

When you read Kathy Reichs, you can depend on a cohesive plot, enough gore to cause a few missed meals, and some good solid character development. "Break No Bones" doesn't disappoint. Tempe Brennan heads to the Charleston islands to assist a local coroner with her caseload. A missing heiress, vanishing homeless people, and visits by both her estranged husband and her longtime lover complicate Tempe's life.While the plot has been used before (Tess Gerritsen's "Harvest" comes immediately to mind), no one has covered it from this angle or with quite as much style as Reichs. New and old fans alike will want to add this volume to their forensic thriller library.

Kate White is the queen of hip, happening myster heroines. I've loved every one of the Bailey Weggins stories so far. White is a clever, of-the-moment writer who seamlessly incorporates Carrie Bradshaw-esque sensibilities into a Miss Marple intellect.This latest Bailey mystery does not meet the standards of the previous books. While the writing is still slick and sexy, the plot is tenuous at best (we're supposed to believe that Bailey would put so much effort and personal risk into investigating the disappearance of someone she's never met?). And the use of "Omigod" should be eliminated from all modern writing.That said, the climax is unexpected and sharp, and Bailey's life is sufficiently glamorous that I'm willing to overlook some of the shortcomings.

I wanted to love this book. I really, really did. But something was missing for me.Schneider tells the story of a meeting with her 90-year-old mother, a former [...] and concentration camp guard whom Schneider has seen only once since the woman abandoned her two children and husband to join the SS.The confrontation is filled with horrors -- admissions of participation in horrendous medical "experiments," culpability in the torturing of prisoners, and a firm loyalty to the beliefs of the [...] party, even decades after the war.Against this conversation, Schneider adds bits of her own history, growing up with a nasty stepmother in the post-war period.What's missing for me is any build up to the conversation. What did it mean to Schneider to be not only motherless, but abandoned for such despicable political beliefs? How has she felt about her mother over the years? What did she miss? Where was her father when her stepmother was mistreating her? What is she trying to achieve in this last conversation?Without this information, the mother/daughter reunion is little more than a conversation between strangers.

Boy or girl, young or old, readers will love reading about Tiger Woods' inspiring rise to the top of the golf world. Overcoming racism, economic hardship, and personal limitations, Tiger leads the pack at an incredibly young age. My 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter and I read this together, and we were all equally enthralled and inspired by Tiger's story. It was accessible without being overly simple. We're looking forward to reading more entries in Matt Christopher's biography series.

After the "Jane Austen Book Club" I was a little hesitant to read a book about reading books... but I found this one quite enjoyable. And the England-isms ("creche" instead of "nursery" and the like) are amusing rather than annoying.Like "Jane Austen," Noble's book is a collection of women and a collection of stories. Each woman responds differently to the books the group has chosen, in accord with her life situation and challenges. Together, they experience illegitimate children, troubled marriages, man trouble, and more.My one complaint is that sometimes the cast of characters is too large, and I'd rather go deeper with one character than spread the drama across more women.However, the book is well-written and enjoyable, and I look forward to Noble's next.

I've read a few chicklit books in my time, so I'm not particularly surprised when these turn out to be formulaic and derivative. But what really set me off in this book was the fact that the main character was a copy editor -- and the book was rife with misspellings and misused words! ("Jeffery" instead of "Jeffrey" comes immediately to mind). Don't waste your time -- there are plenty of other books in this genre that will make you smile instead of make you pull out your red pencil.

I know I should love this book, or at least consider it life-changing, but I just could not muscle my way through it. The typos and poor grammar had me questioning everything (if you can't bother to proof-read, did you bother to fact check?). And the individual anecdotes, cute though they were about dogs tracking hundreds of miles to find their owners and hens who surrogate parented ducks did not have the intended effect of making me see animals as more like "us." In fact, the whole idea of condemning anthropomorphism in one paragraph then making us feel like animals are just furry humans made me throw my hands up.I am a vegan, and I condemn poor treatment of animals and the focus on meat in the American diet. But this book didn't make me feel more strongly about my beliefs -- in fact, I found myself at times sympathizing with the "murderers and oppressors," just because the whole thing was so over the top.I feel bad about the rating I'm giving this book. But I feel worse about the time I wasted reading it.

I expected to love this book, as I really enjoyed the premise -- after the accidental death of a near-stranger, June holds herself responsible for completing the woman's life "to do" list. Along the way, she rediscovers her own passions and purpose -- and, of course, romance.But something was missing. While I know we were supposed to sense June's disconnect from her own life, I never got the feeling that she was at all invested in anything -- even at the end of the book. The distance between herself and the events of her life left me feeling disconnected as well, and I never recovered.

Rare is the author who can write a compelling story in clear prose. Rarer still is the author who can create fine and distinct layers of meaning while maintaining that clear narrative. Ian McEwan is one of those authors.In the tradition of "Mrs. Dalloway," "Saturday" traces the ordinary activities of an ordinary man, neurologist Henry Preowne. Against the backdrop of a huge anti-war march in London, Henry goes about his daily activities -- a squash game, checking in on his patients at the hospital, getting ready for a dinner with family. Much as the world changed irrevocably after September 11, this day is one that will never be forgotten. A minor car accident with a neurologically impaired man has cataclysmic effects for Henry, his family, and the man himself.Taking on issues of terrorism, war, and duty, "Saturday" is a touching story of the ordinary man trying to do the right thing when "the right thing" isn't clear.I think that some of the other readers may have had issues with the disparate themes -- brain surgery, al Qaida, war, terrorism, family -- because they are not easily tied together, other than to say that those of us who look like terrorists (i.e., Baxter) may have other, non-apparent reasons for our actions. Terrorism is in the eye of the beholder, and the world is full of shades of grey. Those of us who try to take simple stances on tough questions are guilty of limited thinking.This book is worth a read -- let it sit with you, and see what connections you make for yourself.

This novel, a fictional account of the real-life disappearance of a dozen American travelers in Burma in the 21st century, is arguably Tan's most ambitious undertaking to date. Tan attempts to weave together past and present, the mystical and the concrete, the western and the eastern in a story that is, in part, a history of Burma, a decrying of the West's globalization and attempts to "help" native peoples, as well as the tale of misunderstandings between all people, regardless of their sex, religion, customs, or native languages.Tan is indeed a gifted storyteller, but her ambitions exceed her achievements with this book. The very thing that is amazing about it -- the amount of detail and backstory she provides for each character -- is the same thing that bogs the narrative down. Too many characters, too much information, too many pages of detail, and too many storylines left me confused and numb.

I was looking forward to a book that would tell me HOW to manage it all... and that would share some stories (good and bad!) about another working mom who cares just as much about her power lunch as she does about taking snacks to her kid's soccer game. If anyone could do it, I figured Bonnie Fuller would be able to.The book started off well. Like Fuller states in the early chapters, I am frustrated by the magazine stands full of headlines telling me to scale down, cut back, and simplify. (It's something I've strived to do for years with little success). I was also taken with the idea that this self-proclaimed Jewish Canadian geek would share her secrets about running with the big media dogs in NYC.Unfortunately, little of the intervening chapters did much to enhance my knowledge of how to create -- and handle -- the life Fuller describes. Instead of hard-core details, we're offered platitudes like "Don't wait for a man before you begin your life" and "Stick to grey and black for professional clothes." Not exactly earth-shattering stuff.I did enjoy Fuller's insider's look at the publishing business, scant though the details were. I really would have enjoyed a deeper book, rather than something that seemed to be written on her 20-minute lunch break.

I am a thirty-something, pretty hip, pretty shapely Californian, and there is not one pattern in this book that I would wear, let alone spend the time knitting. "Sexy" is a misnomer -- "trashy" would be better. I was hoping for some non-dumpy-looking sweaters and flattering garments, and instead I got see-through tops, peek-a-boo swimsuits, and bare midriffs galore. The only person I know who has the body to get away with this stuff is my 14-year-old niece, and her mom wouldn't let her out of the house wearing anything in this book! Save your money. Wrap yourself in cellophane and save yourself the trouble of getting out your needles.

Anyone who can relay her feelings about writing with as much clarity, insight, and humor as Amy Tan deserves five stars. I was amazed at how she's able to get at the core of her thoughts and feelings about the process of writing so eloquently. She's amazingly funny, too!If you like Tan's work, if you're a writer, or if you just enjoy hearing thoughts about the creative process, read this book. I especially enjoyed it as I listened to it on CD, read by Tan herself. She is a delight, someone who's got the rate combination of thoughtfulness, introspection, and wit.

I'm a mystery snob, I admit it. I'm also a yarn snob. Put the two together, and maybe I'm not going to be the easiest critic of a knitting mystery. All the same, "Knit One, Kill Two" was a pleasant -- if not entirely convincing -- mystery. The plot was so-so -- I know you need to suspend disbelief in a "cozy" series, but the coincidences here went a bit over the edge. But I liked the majority of the characters, who were well-developed, and the knitting setting was intriguing. Only a three-star review, but I will check out the next in the series.

The problem with books like these is there's really no one to root for. Save Dr. Frankie, the rest of the cast is self-absorbed, poor-little-rich girls and boys. While it's amusing to watch their "master of the universe" antics, it also made me feel depressed and more than a little guilty that I was spending time on such vapid characters. All the same, it's nice to know that even the rich and "perfect" have the same insecurities as the rest of us mere mortals.

I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud at a book. I certainly didn't expect to get my first good guffaw in years from a book on writing. But if anything, author and editor Pat Walsh specializes in the out-of-the-ordinary. Not only does Walsh offer great insider tips to writers, he does so with humor, self-deprecation, and experience.While there isn't a ton of new material here (most experienced writers already know not to use glittery paper and heart stickers when submitting their manuscripts), it's always good to be reminded that there are real people behind the form letters sent out with such abandon.I can't say I have changed anything about the way I'm writing and submitting my novel, but I did enjoy Walsh's writing, and finished the book with a renewed determination to make it out of the slush pile.

When my son's third-grade teacher said the students could get extra credit for doing science experiments in front of the class, I began a search for a great book that would not only give simple, interesting experiments, but that would provide information about the concepts behind the projects. This book fit the bill perfectly! We've done two or three of these in front of the class already -- the kids were interested, and my son was able to convey some interesting scientific principles. Great for teachers, home schoolers, or parents intent on getting their kids extra credit. :)

Thank goodness for people like Dr. Firlik, who are willing to take the notes and keep track of the memories in order to give "the rest of us" a view from their perspective. I was alternately shocked, horrified, amused, and impressed by Firlik's tales of life as a neurosurgeon. Firlik is a talented writer, and I can only assume she's as impressive with the scalpel as she is with the pen. I must say, however, that were I searching for someone to operate on my brain, I'd feel more comfortable with someone who had a modicum of belief in a "higher power." Just my personal opinion.If you're a "memoir" junky like I am, you'll enjoy this easy-to-read glimpse into the life of a brain doc.

It's easy to see why Maron is a queen of mystery. Her stories seem to flow from her pen without much hesitation or loss of narrative thread.However, it may be this very ease that makes this story lacking in depth. Maron writes a good mystery, but it could be a great one if she gave more time to character development, interaction, and plot.While her characters are interesting, they seem flat, two-dimensional, as does the plot. The resolution of the mystery and the various relationship issues between the characters was a letdown, ending with a whimper, not a bang.Still, a decent story. But what does the title have to do with the book? Hate that.

With a protagonist as quirky and likeable as Oscar Schell, it's impossible to dislike this book. Set in NYC against the backdrop of Sept. 11, nine-year-old Oscar is on a quest to find the lock that fits the key he's found in his dead father's possessions. Over the ensuing months, he forges links with the world and discovers many ways of dealing with loss -- some successful, some not.I enjoyed the present-day portions of this novel but was less taken with the flashbacks of Oscar's grandfather's passages. They were a bit dreary, and I found it difficult to shift back and forth from the grittiness and touching present-day, as presented by Oscar, to the magical realism of the past.In addition, I felt that Foer tried too hard in places to be original... why would Thomas tattoo "Yes" and "No" on his hands when he could simply nod or shake his head? Why would he and his wife decide on "nothing" places in their apartment? It was interesting, in a way, but I felt like certain elements were stretching too far.Overall, though, an amazing book. I love Oscar and will miss him. If you liked "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime," you'll like "Extremely Loud."

I have really enjoyed this series, and was intrigued by the idea of "cellular memories." But I was so disappointed in the resolution of this book -- I felt like McCall Smith ran out of energy after writing the first 75 percent of the book. The end just petered out. I kept expecting some kind of "kicker," but none ever came.The writing, as always, is smooth, and the descriptions of Edinburgh compelling. But there wasn't much else to recommend about the book.

That's why I was so excited to get my hands on "A Spot of Bother" by the same author. Unfortunately, this book didn't come near the interest level or originality of its predecessor.This book reminded me of a blend of Jonathan Franzen ("The Corrections") and Nick Hornsby ("How to Be Good"), neither of which I enjoyed much. I found "Bother" to be deathly slow and the characters to be frankly uninteresting. I kept hoping one of them would die, just to liven things up, paradoxically speaking.Though I hate to admit it, I quit reading after 150 pages.

You know those arts and crafts books that show you cool projects but leave you with absolutely no idea how to re-create the pictures? This is NOT one of those. Claudine Hellmuth gives very specific, step-by-step instructions as to how to get the same results she does. And with her quirky, whimsical style, you'll want to try everything in this book! A must-have for collage artists, scrapbookers, and paper crafters.

Somehow the standards for fiction and memoir are different. In a "real" story, I expect things to be a tad disjointed and unresolved in spots, and I will even tolerate a certain amount of poor writing. After all, the author is somewhat limited by the facts (unless he's James Frey). In a novel, however, none of that is acceptable. Don't try to sell me a half-assed book if you have the freedom to make up whatever the heck you want.Although Cutler presents this book as a novel, it's well-known that she lived this life. And so I read this book more as a memoir than as a work of fiction. The good news is that Cutler benefitted from my lower standards -- which is good, because as a novel this book fails on basically every front. It's poorly written, the characters are superficial, and the plot is non-existent.The bad news (for Cutler) is that I basically hate her and Jackie, her main character. They are disgusting, sleazy narcissists who see others as nothing more than a source of entertainment and a mark for their nastiness. Cutler makes Monica Lewinsky look like a prude. Her parents must be very proud.

Forget about "The Secret!" Books like these are the ones that will REALLY change your life. I appreciated the author's no-nonsense, practical approach.If you like this approach, another book you might like is "The Life Organizer" by Jennifer Louden. It is full of questions and prompts to help you envision the life that will make your heart beat faster. It makes a great companion to this volume.

Finally, a book about diet that isn't a diet! Instead, it's a compilation of all the information about losing weight and keeping it off through lifestyle changes. Easy to read, nicely presented, this book set me on a one-year plan to lose those last 10 pounds -- one habit at a time.

Having a child in critical medical condition is enough to send any parent into a tailspin. But couple that with watching your spouse die unexpectedly, and you've got a recipe for a breakdown.No one would have blamed acclaimed writer Joan Didion for falling apart during this nightmare. But instead of closing down and recovering in isolation, Didion chose to write about the event, chronicling the pain, the anguish, and the unwelcome memories that throw her into what she calls "the vortex."Her experiences are sprinkled lightly with quotes from Freud and other scientists who studied humans' response to profound loss, lending the work an air of universality.Her book, while touching on the darkest of emotions, is not in the least depressing; it is also not written in a "Pollyanna" style. Instead, it offers hope in its honesty, in the way Didion reaches for the light at the end of the tunnel, even when she cannot see it.

I picked this up because I'm a sucker for Christmas books, particulary mysteries. And I liked the catering angle. Overall, it was a decent book, but the Christmas angle was definitely beside the point. It could have easily have been set at any time of year, as the murder itself had nothing to do with Christmas.I also found it very confusing -- Apparently, this is the third book in the series, but there was virtually no backstory provided on any of the main characters. As a result, it took me several chapters to get everyone sorted out.Another element that bothered me was the fact that every suspect seemed to be in on knowledge that "everyone knows about" EXCEPT our sleuths. That was really confusing. If the food biz is such a small world, wouldn't they know what was going on, too?Anyway, a quick read, and fun. But I probably won't pick up another one from the series anytime soon.

Parents and kids alike will love the humor in the Minnie and Moo series. This one in particular is full of scary antics -- but not TOO scary. For instance, readers will know right away that the "farmer's leg" is a branch off the old apple tree -- but it's fun to see them all worry about it.Entertaining, humorous, and easy to read. Great combo!

I'm used to J.A. Jance's Sheriff Joanna Brady series, so this book was a pleasant surprise. Much rougher and edgier than the Joanna Brady series, Hour of the Hunter was a well-plotted, exciting book. A few minor issues -- the ending seemed to arise out of nowhere, very abrupt after the lead-up. And the final punishment for the criminal wasn't nearly harsh enough. All the same, a nice change from Jance's series.If you liked this book, particularly the native American references, you'll love Tony Hellerman's series.

Life cannot be easy for developmentally disabled adults. It's also not easy for their families. The reader sees both sides of the coin in Simon's story of spending 12 months with her mentally retarded sister, doing what Beth loves best -- riding the city's buses.Simon, a high-powered writer and college instructor, must deal with her own feelings of anger and inadequacy -- anger at her sister's stubborn resistance to making the "right" choices, and inadequacy at accepting her for who she is.During the twelve months, she gains an appreciation for the everyday challenges and discrimation her sister faces, as well as an envy of Beth's ability to forge strong relationships with strangers.A worthy book, if a little drawn-out and slow in spots.

I am a big Hornby fan. I loved "About a Boy" and "High Fidelity" even before they were made into blockbuster films with attractive leading men. But Hornby kind of lost me with "How to Be Good" and he's only partially recovered my loyalty with this, his latest novel. The story of a Gang of Four who become a dysfunctional family of sorts when they meet at the local do-yourself-in tall building on New Year's Eve, "A Long Way Down" is told from mutliple points of view. Hornby does an excellent job of adapting perspective in a believable manner, and though the premise is far-fetched, his versimilitude in terms of language and life philosophy gets this reader to suspend her disbelief. The book lags in the middle third, and only partially recovers by the end. There are more laughs than in "How to Be Good," and the ending is quite light, considering where the book began. Worth a read, but far from his best.

A long-lost relative, a hidden treasure map, a murdered matriach leaving behind a quirky will... this story had all the potential to be a page turner. But while this was a well-written book in the language sense, I found the plot extremely difficult to follow.There were too many new characters, too many threads for the mystery to follow, and too many unnecessary passages (like spending PAGES on the family's visit through Aunt Edyth's house) and strange "mistakes" (like Katie calling Jan "aunt" when she's really her cousin).I appreciate the author's vivid imagination, but she needed a good editor to reign her in a bit and have her focus more on a few storylines, rather than introducing so much at once.And though I'm always willing to suspend disbelief, I'm starting to raise my eyebrows at Betsy's involvement in situations where she has absolutely no business being. And her leaps of intellect (following "clues" to bizarre conclusions) left me in the dust.If I could give it 2.5 stars, I would. I'm rounding up because Ferris is such a talented writer.PS What happened to Betsy's boyfriend? And I miss Jill!

I listened to this book on CD and I'm glad I did. I think I would have been bored with it if I had read it -- lots of detail and not a lot of emotion. I enjoyed it nonetheless, due in no small part to the lovely accented voice of the narrator. Books like this that condense several generations into one volume make me depressed, though, as if I fear my own life will merit little more than a few chapters. And I wanted to tell Gogol, "It's just a name -- get over it already!" Still, I'm giving it a high rating for the clarity of the writing and the way the author was able to describe in such detail without boring me to tears.

The first fictional tale in Augusten Burrough's repertoire (and his first book), "Sellevision" is a tongue-in-cheek look behind the scenes at a home shopping network. Rife with quirky characters and on-and-off-camera hijinks, "Sellevision" is a quick read, and a fun retreat from reality. Light and clearly written, this is an enjoyable book, but one you probably won't mind leaving on the beach after you've finished it.

James Brown, the author of several novels including "Final Performance" and "Lucky Town," has mined his dysfunctional childhood many times for material. And he's had plenty to choose from, including an arsonist mother who bankrupted the family, the alcoholism and drug addiction (and subsequent suicides) of his brother and his sister, and his own battles with alcohol and drugs and failed marriage.This book is less a chronology of his life than a series of vignettes from his childhood, strung together with scenes from his adult years. So much pain, so much tragedy -- it makes the reader wonder how he was able to redeem himself and recover.While Brown writes clearly and clear-eyed, it's from a distance. He relates the stories of his life with a detachment that leaves the reader unaffected by even some of the most horrific events. And when he finally comes to the point where he must choose between life and death, it's almost anticlimactic -- there's no sense of the torment that must have gripped him. Perhaps, though, it's this very detachment that has allowed him to survive.This is the book that James Frey might have written if he'd stuck to the truth. There's not as much high drama and not as many memorable characters, but it rings true. And these days, there's a lot to be said for that.

Reichs is an awesome writer, and her skill with plotting and words still shone through this somewhat convoluted storyline. There were simply too many people, too many plot twists, too many historical references and figures, and too many unfamiliar terms for me to keep straight. I found myself racing to the end to finish. And I was sure glad when I could mark this "done." If you have a degree in religion, archaeology, or Jewish history, you'll probably keep up just fine. But for us mere mortals, it was way over my head.

I keep reading the Lucy Stone mysteries, hoping they'll get better. Unfortunately, they seem to have hit a new low. Anthrax? A secret chemical lab on an abandoned island? Evil scientists? I felt like I was watching an episode of "Scooby Doo" instead of reading a quality mystery novel.I think Lucy needs to take a rest from her sleuthing.

I love crosswords, and I'd venture to say that anyone who picks up a book like this would have to be a cruciverbalist (to use Romano's word) as well. That said, it's unclear why the author spent so much of this book addressing his words to those who have never attempted a puzzle -- in turns justifying his love for them and trying to explain how to complete one.The parts of this book that really shone for me were when Romano lost his supercilious attitude (does he need to remind us AGAIN that Will Shortz has a tendency to hyphenate adverbial clauses???) and simply told us what he saw and experienced at the tournament.He lost me numerous times with long, meandering sentences and hifalutin words that I didn't have the energy to look up in the dictionary. I was also turned off with his over-inflated ego that seemed to interpret any male as a threat to his manhood and any woman as a possible sexual conquest.All told, I did enjoy the descriptions of the constructors, the process of creating a puzzle, and some of the personalities behind it.

This has to be one of the most boring books I've read in a long time. I got to page 100 and just couldn't force myself to keep going. It's so disappointing because Cline is obviously a talented writer... but this book was simply painful. Not worth the time. I didn't care about any of the characters, which is too bad because the ingredients were there for a very interesting read. Instead, zzzzz....

This is the first in the "Charlotte LaRue" mystery series for me. While I typically reach for books with younger sleuths, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Charlotte has a lot of moxie for a gal of her age! :) However, she can fall into the "I'm set in my ways, so deal with it" trap -- coming across as a crotchety old busybody at times, even though it's clear from her work schedule that she's anything but old and decrepit.I really enjoyed Barbara Colley's take on New Orleans, one of my favorite cities in the world. I would have liked the setting to play an even larger part in the story, seeing as it's such an amazing, unique place. It could almost serve as another character if done right (a la Anne Rice).I have to admit that the plot turns left me a bit in the dust as the story made hairpin turn after hairpin turn in the last few chapters. Too much happening. Mystery writers need to learn that most readers pick up series mysteries for the characters, not for the plot! You don't have to wow me with your ability to spin an intricate web -- just make me fall in love with your characters and I'm yours for life.While I'm not dedicated enough to go back and read all the Charlotte LaRue books from the beginning, I definitely wouldn't pass up a chance to read another.

Of all the Southern Vampire mysteries, this one is my favorite so far. There was a logical (if somewhat thin) storyline that was fairly easy to follow, the characters acted predictably, and there was enough going on to make the story interesting, but not overwhelming.One thing I cannot understand is, what is Sookie Stackhouse's appeal?? I understand she's tall and blonde and is fairly well-endowed... but...??? In every book, she has at least four "men" (if you can call a were panther, a werewolf, a shifter, and a vampire or two "men") aching to jump her bones. I just don't get it -- particularly when you take into consideration that she says she's inexperienced in matters of the heart. Enough is enough!Overall, though, I enjoyed this book. Just enough spook to make it interesting. Memorable characters, and a lot of fun. Perfect October Halloween read.

I know, I know, diet books are a dime a dozen. But after hearing the author speak on Oprah, I checked this book out of the library -- and had to wait weeks to get a copy! I love her approach that says, "All things in moderation, nothing in excess." Any dietary advice that includes chocolate and bread is okay in my book! I liked it so much I plan to buy my own copy. The advice on exercise and the recipes were very helpful.

I am a huge fan of the China Bayles mysteries, but this one just didn't do it for me. While still worth a read, there were too many chapters ending on foreshadowing, and too much of China telling the police their business. And too many loose ends at the end! In a mystery, I feel that most everything should be nicely wrapped up at the end. We keep reading because we love the characters, not because some cheap plot trick is drawing us back for more.

Vincent goes behind the scenes -- and behind the suit -- to see what life is really like as a member of the opposite sex. Written in an honest, straightforward, down-to-earth if somewhat overly academic manner, this book shows what goes on in the typically male realms of girly bars, bowling alleys, monastery retreats, and men's wilderness retreats. Vincent makes no sweeping statements, doing her best to convey that her experiences are colored by her particular circumstances. An interesting, if not particularly enlightening, read.

Goldy Schultz is at it again, this time taking on a crew of hostile attorneys and their dragon-like office manager in search of a killer.This book is true Goldy style, complete with all the good (wacky characters, slapstick antics, yummy recipes and a strong plot) as well as the not-so-good (confusing action scenes, strange italicized phrases, and a bit too unbelievable and convoluted a plot).Take a bite -- it won't kill you. :)

I'm a sucker for any mystery that's craft-related and set at Christmas time -- this book by Monica Ferris fits the bill. While I found the writing approach (different points of view, flashing forward and back in time) to be quite confusing, the writng itself was clear and entertaining. And though I'm not a needleworker, the descriptions of the patterns and samplers were so compelling that I feel the urge to pick up a needle and some floss!Not a bad book, but not particularly memorable, either.

Catherine Newman is the kind of person you want living next door. Funny, irreverent, with a heart as big as the mattress on her family bed. She also is a great writer, with the ability to notice the little things and comment on them in a way that gives them the importance they deserve. Wry, witty, and self-deprecating, Newman tracks her journey to the birth of her second child in "Waiting for Birdy." Nothing -- from the tangerine-sized hemorrhoids to the "barfy flu" to her sometimes absentminded OB -- escapes her laser-like scrutiny.If there is a drawback to this book, it's in Newman's recounting of every cute moment and utterance from her preschooler. Everyone thinks their child is the cutest, brightest, most witty -- and reading about her son's latest witticism grew a bit tiresome at times. But he does sound pretty darned cute.All in all, though, Newman won me over, though I am five years removed from giving birth. It made me long for those delicious baby days, almost enough to give it another try.

Before Chick Lit there were women's contemporary writers like Elizabeth Berg and Barbara Kingsolver -- writers who touched at the issues and concerns of women, but did so with intelligence and wit. Jeanne Ray writes in the same way -- perhaps with a bit less intensity, but definitely with the same pen. Eat Cake tells the story of a middle-aged woman who must recreate herself when her life is turned upside-down by her husband's layoff and warring parents. She delves into her deepest desires and finds -- herself.

If I could give this book more than five stars, I would.We received this book as a gift, and I wasn't too sure about it because the illustrations are not my style. But I was hooked by the first couple of pages. Molly Lou Melon, a short, bullfrog-voiced, buck-toothed dynamo shows kids how to stand up for themselves and love their individuality with humor and grace.The illustrations are full of hidden gems, the story is short and full of meaning, and kids of all ages will get a kick out of Molly Lou's antics.

I was pretty disappointed in this book. I was all settled in for a great story of learning to live with less... And instead found myself reading about self-discovery through eschewing the elevator. Really?!The topics were covered with such a superficial treatment that they felt like magazine fluff pieces: All style and no substance. I quit halfway through the book after leafing ahead and seeing no redemption in the near future.And anyone who has THAT much trouble giving up drinking for a month might seriously want to consider a treatment program.

"Uncharted Territory" is true! Donna Downey can do things you never would have imagined with ordinary household objects and scrapbooking materials. I couldn't put this book down -- I stayed up all night reading it, marking projects to make. So much inspiration -- so much fun! So nice that she also offers step-by-step instructions, unlike many books and magazines that just give you product lists and expect you to figure out everything on your own. Very well-done.

But if you want pages and pages of great inspiration and top-notch design, don't miss this book.

I'll admit, if it says "Heidi Swapp" on it, I will buy it! I ordered this book and got it as soon as it came out. But after leafing through the whole thing several times, it's still sitting on my shelf. It comes in a cute package and has some fun add-ons (a pencil, a ruler, a pad), but it kind of seems like a glorified magazine article. I was expecting more "how-to's" in terms of how Heidi gets her signature style and creates some of her unique looks. But there wasn't a ton of instruction (I'm still trying to figure out how she does the shadow effect).All in all, it's a fun book to have and to play around with, but it's not going to turn you into a creator of illuminated manuscripts overnight.

It's hard to sympathize too much with a main character who not only is "pretty verging on stunning," but who has her own business, great friends, and a cute dog, to boot. The only flies in Carmela's ointment seem to be the dead bodies that constantly crop (no pun intended) up. The old "bad twin" card was played here, as was the wandering-around-the-graveyard-in-the-dark trick. A little too predictable, a little too light on realistic character development, and a little too cutesy. And would someone please get this woman an editor? "Courier" and Ives is just an embarrassment, as is the misspelling of "zydeco" in a book based in N'Awlins. Don't forget "commaraderie" (is that being on good terms with your punctuation?) and "mother load" (a truckful of maternal-types?).All the same, Laura Childs can write -- no doubt about that. I think she just needs to take a little more time plotting and writing to take this series to the next level.

I am always interested in memoirs by famous people. Tracking their path to fame is usually enlightening and entertaining.I've found that books by comics are particularly difficult to read. So much of their entertainment value comes from non-verbal communications. This was true of Cho as well. The book felt flat to me, and it was disjointed, jumping from timeframe to timeframe with no particular rhyme or reason. While many of the anecdotes conveyed were interesting, I had trouble following along.As a result, I stopped about halfway through. It was just too confusing for me, though I value her story and experiences.For the light of heart -- you may want to avoid this book. It's quite graphic in parts and she doesn't hold back on the sex, drugs or rock-n-roll.

I love humorous personal essays, and I love travel misadventure sagas. Put them together, and you have the recipe for a hilarious book. Beginning with the title and on through each of the couple of dozen essays, humor and hijinks abound! Read about shopping for undies from the street vendors in India, or getting attacked by a brain-sucking beetle via the ear canal... you'll groan, grab your stomach, and laugh, laugh, laugh. I can't wait to read the other collections by this editor. Fabulous!

Every once in a while, I like a book that makes me think, but makes me think about my immediate world, the little questions that occur to me every day. The big world questions (how to bring world peace, how to solve hunger, why do men kill each other) are too ambitious and depressing for the likes of me. And that's why this series by McCall Smith appeals to me so much -- he makes me think, but does so in an immediate, useful sort of way.This, the third in his Isabel Dalhousie series, doesn't disappoint on that account. As usual, Isabel is occupied with musings about the oddities of people and their motives. She's forced to turn her scrutiny inward as she finds herself tempted to go against her ethical leanings for a variety of reasons.As in the other Dalhousie books, not a heck of a lot happens in this book. Her relationship with Jamie is furthered, and we learn more about her "sainted American mother." But other than a deepening of relationships, the action is thin.That would be fine, except for the fact that this series is billed as a mystery series, and the mysterious is few and far between.I do enjoy Isabel's musings, if I'm a little tired of the way she (and everyone else in the book) seems to repeat everything they say. Really repeat it. Do people in Scotland talk that way? I mean, really? Really really?Still, I give the book -- and the series -- high marks for making this busy mom of three take a break and think about life. Really think about it. Really.
