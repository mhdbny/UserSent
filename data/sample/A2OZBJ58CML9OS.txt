I have to echo some of the other sentiments I've read here: I'm a fan, and I had great expectations for this concert. But the truth is, it's really just an average performance of admittedly-great material.The first thing you can't help but notice is that Geoff Tate's voice just ain't what it used to be. I always thought Pamela Moore (as Sister Mary) was a fine addition the original Mindcrime performances. But using her to help Tate hit the high notes just doesn't make sense. . .her voice is deeper than his!Sadly, the problems don't end there. I've got a pretty decent surround-sound system, and played both discs with the 5.1 surround option on. But it's often hard to make out what Moore or the rest of the band (besides Tate, I mean) is singing. I think the DVD's producers picked up on this, because there are many instances when the lyrics being sung by background singers flash on the screen--a sort of forced subtitling. And while we're on that subject for a moment, I found much of the editing to be distracting.On the plus side, using live actors in addition to the 18 year-old original Mindcrime video footage does bring a certain urgency to the story, something that video screens alone could never do. Even if you know it's coming, the death of Mary is a graphic shock that you'll not soon forget. Geoff Tate overacts like mad, yet it somehow works within the framework of the story.Mindcrime 2 vs. Mindcrime 1? Well, it just depends on your own taste. If you liked the 2nd album, you'll probably like seeing it live. I'm a big Queensryche fan, but I couldn't give a crap about Ronnie James Dio, so it didn't bother me that his contribution was relegated to a video screen. My personal feelings about OM2 were that there was way too much Sister Mary, and I felt the same way about the live performance.Bottom line: If you're a fan, it might be worth it. However, you may have noticed a number of fans here that were disapppointed. I would suggest renting it first if you can.

If I had to write a one-word review of this deluxe 2-disc treatment of the landmark film WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, it would be. . ."Wow!"Much like director Robert Zemeckis' BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, time has done very little to tarnish the charm of this amazing fantasy film. It's all the more impressive when you realize it was made without ANY computer animation. Every cell of animation (all 80,000 of 'em) was done the old-fashioned way: by hand. But enough about the film itself. It looks and sounds great.The Vista Series release gives you 4 options for viewing the film. In addition to watching the film in your choice of widescreen or full-frame, you can choose from two informative supplemental tracks. One is an audio commentary from the filmmakers, the other is a "Pop Up Video"-style feature which provides a constant barrage of on-screen tidbits about the film. The pop-ups do tend to digress (yes, we know that Tex Avery influenced the style of Roger Rabbit, but do we really need Tex's biography here?), but they are nonetheless informative and often amusing.A well-done half-hour documentary takes viewers behind the scenes. And Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger) hosts a more kid-friendly featurette that nicely evokes the irreverent style of its subject matter. Plus, there's a fun "Toontown" game you can play with your DVD player's remote control, and a few other featurettes on various technical aspects of the production. Oh, and the 3 original Roger Rabbit shorts that were shown with selected Disney films in the late 80's and early 90's.A very impressive, exhaustive presentation that will answer every question you ever might have about this wonderfully fun and original film.

NOTE: This review is for SPIDER-MAN 2.1 Extended Cut.I wouldn't have thought it possible, but the best superhero movie just got even better, with 8 minutes of restored footage. Sure, 8 minutes doesn't sound like much. But most of the additions are subtle--a few lines of dialogue which extend existing scenes. Most of them make sense, especially (SPOILERS AHEAD) those which evoke better understanding of/sympathy for certain characters, and a few which are strictly for laughs. In fact, it's hard to believe that what is arguably the funniest moment in the film was left on the cutting room floor. I won't spoil it, but it's a real treat for fans of J. Jonah Jameson.I realize that the timing of this release coincides with the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3. So what? Sam Raimi has made 2 (maybe 3?) of the most well-defined and purely entertaining comic book films ever. I don't mind spending a few extra bucks to support his efforts, and get to see a bit more of a film that I love.By the way, don't sell your original copy of SPIDER-MAN 2. All the bonus materials are new to this release, so you're not getting duplicates of the film itself or the extras.

Here's a nice treat: Bela Lugosi Jr. has acquired to rights to some of his famous father's lesser films, and the first offering is the lovable, laughable PRC programmer THE DEVIL BAT.Bela is Dr. Carruthers, plotting the death of his enemies by training giant mutated bats to attack those who wear the doc's new experimental shaving lotion. Bela has some great, darkly-comic dialogue. When one intended victim comments on how smooth the new lotion is, Carruthers offers, &quot;I don't think you'll ever wear anything else.&quot;THE DEVIL BAT has, of course, been previously available on DVD and VHS, in various conditions. The best previous DVD release is certainly the one offered by Roan. This new &quot;official&quot; version compares favorably to the Roan disc, though acute listeners might find the sound is a touch clearer on this new disc. Bela Lugosi Jr. partners with genre critic Ted Newsom for an interesting commentary track, which unfortunately shows how little Bela Jr. actually knows about the film.There are 2 other Lugosi theatrical trailers (but not one for Devil Bat?), some archival photos and a pretty neat audio-only feature: A radio play from the 1940's starring Bela.If you're a fan of these type of &quot;poverty row&quot; horrors, DEVIL BAT will certainly make your day. If you're a fan of his more popular Universal features, this is a good introduction to a very different career path that poor ol' Bela got stuck on around 1940.

Let's get right to it: You and I already know that, some 30 years ago, the producers of the "Halloween" franchise took a gamble that didn't pay off. Not only did it not pay off, but few horror films--sequels or not--have been as reviled as this one. So let me tell you upfront that I always kinda liked it.Now, to the Blu-ray. Given the film's reputation, it's pretty amazing that we even HAVE a Blu-ray of it, let alone a bonus-packed 30th anniversary deluxe treatment. So if you're only of the few fans of Halloween III, stop reading and go ahead and order your copy. For the rest of you, I have to say that I am very impressed with the HD upgrade Shout Factory has done. No movie from 1982, and certainly not a low-budget horror film, is going to be as sharp as a new movie. But there are moments in this one that come close to looking brand-new. A standout scene is when "Little Buddy" and his parents visit the Silver Shamrock factory. The orange of the jack o' lantern masks positively GLOWS. The film does contain a lot of night shots, and even those aren't overly grainy. The sound mix also seems right. . .for better or worse, get ready to have the Silver Shamrock jingle lodged in your head all over again!There's a breezy and informative 33-minute documentary, "Stand Alone: The Making of Halloween III." It's nice to see the original actors like Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin, and director Tommy Lee Wallace share fond memories of the production. No ones takes themselves too seriously, acknowledging the film's failure while still expressing pride at being part of it. Atkins comes off particularly affable, all the more enlightening since his performance as a leading man is rather dull.Wallace waxes nostalgic in a sporadically amusing commentary track, while a tour of the film's locations is pretty boring. Finally, there are the (lame) teaser and full theatrical trailers for the film. Oddly, even with a decent collection of special featuers, the disc does not have a scene menu that allows you to start the film wherever you want.Although it may not sway the hardcore haters, this well-done presentation of a cult film should be embraced by the few who "get" the film. And you know, 30 years is a long time. . .I hope that those who might have been "on the fence" about it or simply haven't seen the film since 1982 will consider giving it another look.

1999's comeback "Supernatural" was, of course, hugely successful. And it still sounds great today. 2002's "Shaman" followed the blueprint of its predecessor, but fell a bit short. Now the trend continues with "All That I Am." And frankly, the formula is starting to wear a bit thin.I won't waste time justifying Carlos Santana's status as one of the greatest living musicians still working today...you probably already know that. But his choice of material becomes less inspired with each of these well-intentioned collaborations. The guest stars are all credible (except maybe Bo Bice?), and I have to give Santana credit for at least making a more cohesive album this time out...whatever "Shaman"'s merits might be, Macy Gray and Placido Domingo do NOT belong on the same album.I admit, I know very little about the pre-Supernatural Santana, so I find it ironic that the cuts I enjoyed most on "All That I Am" are, in fact, the more traditional Spanish-language dance tunes. The duets, for the most part, are just adequate. The Michelle Branch number is a bit too similiar to her previous colloboration with the group, "The Game of Love." Steven Tyler is miscast in "Just Feel Better." Even Santana disciples Los Lonely Boys seem to just be playing by-the-numbers on their track.Enough has been said about this new copy-protection process...but here's my 2 cents: I bought a copy of Santana's CD. I should be able to make as many copies, pull out separate tracks for mix CD's, or do ANYTHING I WANT with it because I paid for the priviledge. The software included is very awkward, and it's not 100% compatible with my computer. The irony is: I now have to seek out file-sharing programs--the very thing that this software seeks to end--to make copies OF A CD I PAID FOR.But back to the album: I'd recommend try before you buy. I'd make you copy to listen to, free of charge...but alas, I can't.

When Universal released 75th Annivesary editions of Dracula and Frankenstein in 2006, I assumed they would release a similiar set the following year for the Mummy, to mark its anniversary. But 2007 came and went, with no new Mummy DVD. Now, a year later, we finally get this deluxe edition.Before I get into the specifics of the discs, I want to share a few thoughts about the film itself. I've always felt that The Mummy was treated with a bit less respect than Universal's premiere big-screen sound horror movies, Dracula and Frankenstein. And there's a reason for that: The film offers a more subtle approach to its thrills than those other landmarks of the genre. As the film's title creature's moves and slow and deliberate, so is the pace of the film. You probably already know that the iconic bandage-wrapped mummy is only onscreen for a few seconds. For the bulk of the film, Boris Karloff appears as Ardeth Bey, the 3700 year old (unwrapped) priest who was buried alive for committing blasphemy. While the film in some ways confounds expectations--especially if you've seen a "proper" mummy film, with the living dead skulking around killing folks who've disturbed his/her rest--Karloff's commanding yet understated performance elevates the film to classic status.Now, if you've bought either of the two previously-released DVD versions of The Mummy, you might wonder whether you should bother with this edition. And I think it comes down to how much you like the film itself, and whether you have a strong desire to learn a little more about its creation. As for the film itself, I've compared it to both the original single-disc release and the 2004 Legacy Collection version. . .and haven't found enough differences in the audio or video quality to recommend an upgrade solely based on expected improvments in the transfer. There's still some graininess to be found in the outdoor scenes, but the overall result probably represents the best the film will ever look. Audio? It's a mono film; it doesn't matter if you have the latest Dolby Pro-Geek 13.1 Surround Sound or whatever, it won't sound any better.There are several bonus features which were held over from the Legacy Collection. These include audio commentaries, the well-done "Mummy Dearest" documentary (actually produced for the single-disc release), a trailer gallery, and the excellent feature-length documentary covering all the classic Universal monsters.A new documentary on makeup artist Jack Pierce is a welcome addition, though at 23 minutes, feels a bit rushed. Less impressive is the even shorter featurette on the evolution of the Mummy character, which jumps from the 1940's sequels to the 1999 remake with Brendan Fraser, ignoring many other good and bad interpretations along the way. The set also includes a free ticket to see the latest modern-day installment, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. I haven't seen it, but I'm assuming it's just as full of empty-headed thrills as its predecessors. Anybody want a free ticket?I'd recommend this set to all die-hard Universal Monsters fans. But if you already have the film on DVD, you might want to consider whether the handful of new material is worth your money.

Now THIS is how you make a DVD of a fan-favorite show! In addition to the rarely-seen special itself (more on that in a minute), you get a wealth of great extra material. I, for one, enjoy learning all the behind-the-scenes info about shows, especially animated ones. There's over an hour of documentary material here, focusing on the holiday special itself, and the universe of He-Man in general. There's a pair of great-looking art cards (apparently there are 16 available in all; I got a terric watercolor painting of She-Ra, and one featuring characters from both series), the rarely-seen music video "I Have the Power," plus a brief making-of segment on the video, a well-designed "character profiles" feature, trivia, and the complete script. The packaging itself is full of colorful artwork, an added bonus for fans.As for the show itself, it holds up fairly well (SPOILERS AHEAD). Unlike many cartoon holiday episodes, however, Christmas is really only a small part of the story. Orko's bumbling accidentally brings two Earth children to Eternia, where they share the news of Christmas with the denizens of She-Ra's world (and since this IS a kids' fantasy show, the legend of Santa take precedence over the Christian holiday, which gets only a throwaway line about Bethlehem). It's all innocent fun, although He-Man fans may cringe at how easily Skeletor is swayed by the Christmas spirit.If you're a fan of He-Man and/or She-Ra, there's no question you should have this in your collection. And if you just like animated holiday fun, give it a try. As a fan of both shows, I couldn't be happier with this first-class package.

Despite the proliferation of sci-fi movies in the Fab Fifties, the truth is, only a handful of films rose above the genre's b-movie budgets and drive-in mentality. In an age where giant radioactive monsters attacked, and stalwart scientist/heroes battled alien menaces, Forbidden Planet stands proud as an "A" picture: A handsomely-mounted interstellar adventure filled with intelligence, wit and wonder.Now's it's the 50th anniversary of this landmark MGM masterpiece, and sci-fi fans (and movie lovers in general) are being rewarded with this deluxe 2-disc release. You can give that previous "bare bones" DVD release to a friend, THIS is Forbidden Planet restored to its Cinescope glory, complete with 5.1 sound. No matter how many times you've seen it (I estimate having seen it myself at least 30 times over the years), you haven't seen the film look this good."Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet" is a great documentary, in which we are fortunate to see many surviving cast members. Leslie Nielsen, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson and others offer their memories of the production. You'll learn how the "id monster" was created, and see Bebe Barron discuss the film's "electronic tonalities." There's also a fun featurette on the creation and cultural impact of Robby the Robot. "Watch the Skies," a documentary which originally aired on TCM, offers a survey of fifites science fiction.Now, all that would be enough to satisfy most fans. But MGM goes the extra mile with MORE features. Most impressive is the inclusion of the 1957 follow-up film THE INVISIBLE BOY, featuring much of the Forbidden Plaent creative team and, of course, Robby the Robot. It's an often-overlooked sci-fi/fantasy film about Robby's friendship with a boy (whose father could seriously use a parenting class). There's also an episode of the 50's t.v. series "The Thin Man," featuring Robby, a clip from "MGM Parade" with Robby and Walter Pidgeon, and a collection of other Warner Bros. sci-fi movie trailers.Certainly, no fan of fifties science fiction can be without this superb set. But I encourage even those who aren't familiar with Forbidden Planet to add this to your collection. It's a deluxe presentation of an acknowledged classic, one you're sure to enjoy for years to come.

What a treat, both for Superman fans and people who just enjoy classic t.v. shows of the fifties. It's pretty much universally acknowledged that season one of THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN is far and away the best of the series. George Reeves was a no-nonsense hero, and quite believable in the role. The series had plenty of action and the first-season scripts were usually solid.And I'm pleasantly surprised to see the rare theatrical feature, SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN included here. Although it's essentially Superman on a b-movie budget, there's plenty to like about this forgotten piece of Superman history.A common practice in the early days of television was to get a show's actors to endorse the advertisers' products. Perhaps the rarest and most unusual treat for fans of classic t.v. are the orignial Kellog's cereal commercials, featuring cast members from the show. Clark Kent sells Frosted Flakes!There's an informative documentary, with comments from Superman experts and a VERY old Jack Larson, who played Jimmy Olsen on the show. With all these extras and a first-rate presentation of the episodes, this is a classic t.v. lover's dream come true. Highly recommended.

Here's a mildly entertaining collection of four poverty-row films from the 1930's. "Dead Men Walk" was the only film I'd heard of before watching this disc. And it's easily the best of the bunch. George Zucco has a dual role as twin brothers, one of whom is resurrected as a vampire. It also marks the final film appearance of genre favorite Dwight Frye. "The Intruder" is a ghost story set aboard a ship. There's some nice atmosphere and some dated comic relief, but it's not a bad little picture. "Tangled Destinies" is a melodrama in which survivors of a plane crash are caught up in ghostly goings-on. "The Phantom" is a typical 30's crime thriller, with a death row inmate targeting a crime-fighting duo.As for the quality of the disc, it varies from film to film. Retromedia is quite adept at finding odd, cult (and yes, forgotten) films. But unlike competitors such as Roan or Image, they don't appear to spend too much effort on restoration. The night scenes in Tangled Destinies are pretty murky, while The Intruder suffers from a "washed out" look in the daytime scenes. Again, Dead Men Walk is the real winner here. There are plenty of scratches, but at least the contrast is. . .well, not exactly right, but much better than the other films. In any event, it's probably the best that any of these films will ever look on DVD.At around an hour each, none of these "forgotten" films will try your patience much. They're certainly slow-moving by today's standards. But if like your old movies with atmosphere and don't mind the obvious low budgets, you could do a lot worse.

Yikes! What a complete waste of time. The scariest thing about this movie is the knowledge that there are several more bona-fide William Castle classics for these hacks at &quot;Dark Castle Entertainment&quot; to butcher. Wrap your short-attention spans around this: The original 13 GHOSTS is available on DVD, and even preserves the gimmick of the &quot;ghost viewers&quot; so you can choose whether or not to see the spirits. Knowing that, there is no reason to even see this pitiful new version.

If you've been keeping up with the DVD releases of Universal Monsters, you might already know this is the 3rd time The Wolf Man has been released in the past 10 years. But this new deluxe 2-disc edition should prove to be the definitive release. In addition to a spectacular restoration (which is still not quite perfect, but probably the best the film will ever look on home video), there is an exhaustive array of bonus features. Actually, only two of them are new, but when added to the already excellent extras carried over from previous releases, this is simply a must-have for anyone with even a slight interest in the film.But let's take a quick look at the film itself. The Wolf Man has always been my favorite Universal Monster. I think it's the combination of Curt Siodmak's poetic and gothically romantic screenplay, and the Everyman performance of Lon Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot. Chaney will perhaps forever reside in the shadow of contemporaries like Karloff and Lugosi, but it's difficult to imagine either of those horror superstars bringing the same authenticity to the role of Talbot.Chaney also gets winning support from Claude Rains, Patrick Knowles and Evelyn Ankers (whose well-documented dislike of Chaney also serves as a testament to her acting abilities...the two are charming together on-screen). Maria Ouspenskaya also appears in her signature roles as the gypsy Maleva, while Bela Lugosi has a too-brief but equally-memorable role as her son.As for the bonus features, the two new ones are a brief (10 min.) overview of werewolf movies featuring the likes of John Landis, Rick Baker and several film critics, and a 36-minute documentary on Chaney's career. As a long-time fan of this fan and Lon Chaney Jr., I confess I didn't learn a lot of new facts about the actor; but for the uninitiated, it will no doubt provide some much-needed illumination into the man and his body of work.Also, in case you missed the previous releases, here are the holdover supplements: "Monster By Moonlight" is a well-done look at the film and its sequels, hosted by John Landis. There's a documentary on makeup wizard Jack Pierce. A trailer gallery features previews for several werewolf films, including the new 2010 version of The Wolf Man (by the way, props to Universal for not making this set an extended commercial for the remake, the way some of the bonus materials inThe Monster Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Dracula / The Wolf Man)did for Stephen Sommer's 2003 bombVan Helsing (Widescreen Edition)). "Universal Horror" is a terrific feature-length documentary on all of Universal's classic horror output. Lastly, an audio commentary with Tom Weaver provides deeper insight into the film's production.Now it must be said that this long-overdue set would probably not have been released at this time without the 2010 remake. And as of this writing, I have not seen the new movie. I do hope that--whether it is ultimately a success or not--it will inspire film fans to go back and take a look at this classic original. Certainly, this is a must-buy for anyone who loves the original film. And remember, Monster Fans. . .there are still many films of this kind that deserve the deluxe treatment. So before you complain about double (wait, make that TRIPLE) dipping to get your hard-earned bucks, remember that future releases are dependent on how well items like this sell. In other words, support your classic monsters! Enjoy the set; I give it my highest recommendation.

Like so many people here, I'm a fan of the original Filmation He-Man series, and was quite skeptical about ordering this 2002 version. But the price was almost unbelievably low (still is as of this writing) for the entire series, so I figured I'd take a chance. And I'm glad I did, because this He-Man is actually a very good series. True, it lacks some of the lighthearted tone and cheerful optimism of the original, but the fact is, the animation is a LOT better. Almost old the old characters are here, just with more modern makeovers. I also like the fact that Prince Adam and He-Man really seem like two different characters, rather than the Clark Kent/Superman-style not-so-secret identity used in the original show.As a hardcore fan of these characters, I'll always prefer the original series. It was, after all, the last fully American hand-drawn animated series produced by a major studio. Most every action cartoon since has been influenced by highly-overrated Japanese "anime" (this is apparent in the fight scenes of this series, though no where near as prevalent as it is in the 1990The New Adventures of He-Man, Vol. 1). But if you'll give the 2002 series a try, you might find that it's really not SO different after all.

First off, I'm a huge Prince fan. And I hate to complain, but I just don't see why this release is necessary, for two reasons: (1) The 3 hits contained herein are already available on the aptly-titled "The Hits" DVD, and (2) there are PLENTY of Prince music videos that have never gotten a home video release of any kind...not to mention the SIGN O THE TIMES concert film. It just kinda bugs me that Warners would put out something like this, when there's so much more to choose from.BUT...if you are a fan, you might want to have it anyway. I bought the VHS version in the early 90's, and I'm content with that. The only other video of note is the Spike Lee-directed "Money Don't Matter 2Nite." The rest is just filler, in my opinion. They could have at least released the bonus remix videos of "Gett Off", including the rare "Violet the Organ Grinder" video (which, thankfully, I also have on tape).

If you're read some the other reviews here, you may notice I was intially a bit skeptical of Olive Films, having not been familiar with them until now. Well, I'm happy to report that the company (actually a part of Paramount, it turns out) did a fine job with this mostly-forgotten Jack Arnold drive-in sci-fi film. While it is true that a 50+ year old low-budget film, even in 1080p, will never have the shine of a recent film shot in high definition, The Space Children is, for the most part, remarkably clear.The film itself concerns an alien being taking possession of the children of some rocket scientists. While the film's promotional materials played up the otherworldly menace, the story itself is actually fairly subdued. This is science fiction that favors talking over action, and although there are some nifty effects, they are sparingly used. The film's anti-war message places it in the company ofThe Day the Earth Stood Still (Special Edition) [Blu-ray] rather than the typical alien-invasion films of the period.As the title of the review states, this is a "bare bones" video release. All you get is the movie. Which is a shame, because there is a great theatrical trailer that can be easily found on the internet. And director Jack Arnold was a generally well-liked and prolific genre filmmaker, so a featurette or even trailers from his other films would have been a nice touch. But as someone who collects and adores films of this type, I consider it a minor miracle that a Blu-ray release of "The Space Children" ever saw the light of day. So for that, I am grateful. And I'm most satisfied to see that Olive Films is a company that cares about these old films.Bottom line: This is a must-have for fans of 50's science fiction. And because this is the first official release of the film on video, there's a good chance that many genre fans haven't even seen it.

After letting their beloved "Golden Collection" DVD line end a few years back, Warner Bros is slowly redeeming itself in the eyes of fans with new-to-video collections like this on Blu-ray and DVD. And let me just say up front that if you are a true fan, Blu-ray is the ONLY way to go here. Aside from the obvious higher resolution images, the Blu set contains 11 additional mouse-themed cartoons, for a total of 30 shorts.You probably already know if these are the kind of Looney Tunes you like. There's no Bugs Bunny here, or "the one with the singing frog." It's just what it says: mouse cartoons, and lots of 'em. Of course, the collection is also essential for fans of the great Chuck Jones. We all know that this doesn't quite represent the maverick director's funniest or most inspired work that he would achieve in his later cartoons. Looney Tunes in general, didn't exactly get, well, looney until the mid-40's anyway. But Jones was still a great visual storyteller, and even his more generic stuff (Sniffles, I'm looking at YOU), was often still colorful and charming.My only complaint with the set is that the cartoons are not listed on the package, nor are there any helpful liner notes. TheLooney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume One (Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] contained a very nice and detailed booklet, listing and describing each short. I admit this is a minor problem, but as a hardcore fan, I expected a little more in the package.So is the "Mouse Chronicles" essential viewing? For true LT fans, of course it is. Casual viewers, however, will probably be bored by some the older, and admittedly less amusing, shorts.

I was very excited when this DVD came out, having some time ago purchase a cheap copy from one of those bargain-DVD companies. And while this is certainly an improvement over the grainy print I owned, I have to say I'm a little disappointed that the film still isn't in great shape. A good portion of the outdoor scenes are pretty murky, making it hard at times to tell what is going on. Some scratches and minor imperfections are to be expected (even though, with today's film restoration technology, I think even these can be fixed). And to be fair, this was a low-budget film that may never have looked that great. I guess I was just hoping for more.Now, a word about the two versions of the film on this disc. I don't want to give away the ending(s) to anyone who hasn't seen it, but let's just say the original U.S. ending has been considered by many fans to be a &quot;cop out&quot; ending. The British version does away with that, as well as the ridiculously long montage that proceeds it. But here's an odd thing: I still think I prefer the more ambigious U.S. ending. It's just more...I don't know....FUN.So maybe this is the best version of INVADERS FROM MARS we'll ever get. It's a fun movie, a minor classic of the beloved genre of 50's sci-fi films. But it does in fact pale (both the film itself and the transfer) beside other acknowledged classics of that era.

While it's true that only two or three of the songs in this collection really seem like modern classics, it's still a very enjoyable album overall. In fact, it's one of those rare CD's where I can listen straight through without being tempted to skip a track here and there.For over 30 years, Milsap has been one of country music's purest voices. The real charm of MY LIFE is that he's never sounded better.

My friend and fellow sci-fi fanatic have our own personal "wish lists" of films we've always wanted to see. Well, Tobor has topped my list for the past 20 years or so. It's almost never shown on t.v., and even the VHS tape of the film has been out-of-print for years. So it was with great enthusiasm that I greeted this long-overdue DVD release.Unfortunately, like so many things that we build up in our minds to be great, the reality is that Tobor isn't really the "lost classic" I'd hoped it would be. Oh, it's hardly a bad film. The production values are first-rate, especially the expansive lab set wherein the title character is created. And I was impressed that there was some real SCIENCE in this science-fiction: The idea of using artificial beings to test the dangers of space travel is a fine idea.Where Tobor misses the mark is with the ludicrous plot device of the robot creating an ESP-based link with its inventor's grandson, which then proves useful when the boy is kidnapped by criminals intent on stealing the mechanical man. It's as if the writers couldn't decide if their story was a kid's movie, or serious sci-fi. With about equal amounts of both, the result is not that satisfying.But if you like 50's sci-fi, you may still find this a worthwhile purchase. It does retain much of the "gee whiz" innocence of the era, and I'm sure the nostalgia factor is high for anyone growing up during that time.For a much better boy-and-his-robot picture, check out THE INVISIBLE BOY, available as a bonus feature withForbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition).

Hey, I'm all about some nifty 50's and 60's cheesy sci-fi flicks. Heck, I LOVE 'EM! But I have to say I think ANGRY RED PLANET is a bit overrated. I never saw &quot;Cinemagic&quot; displayed on the Big Screen, but it's fairly headache-inducing on my 27-inch t.v.The plot has one decent gimmick, the framing device of using flashbacks (used to better effect in IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE) to tell the story. But really, the acting is atrocious, even for a B-grade sci-fi/monster flick.On the plus side, the &quot;batratspidercrab&quot; thing is one of the more memorable beasties, strings and all. And the sets, though obviously painted backgrounds, are imaginative and just plain weird.Picture and sound quality are what we've come to expect from MGM's Midnite Movies line: superb. So if this kind of film is your thing, you could do worse than ANGRY RED PLANET. But. . .you could also do a lot better.

The brilliant thing about CMT Crossroads is that it combines rock and country acts that you might think would NEVER work. And this has never been more apparent than in this pairing of country's new golden girl, and one of the 80's most-celebrated "hair metal" bands. It should have been a trainwreck, but it works beautifully.Swift lets her inner rock girl loose right from the start, with the opening lines of Def's "Photograph." Fans have seen her signature moves by now, but it's refreshing to see them put in service of some really rockin' tunes. And Joe Elliot & Co. complement Swift's songs effortlessly.The interviews and clips from the press conference are breezy and informative, as well. Elliot quips that his country co-star wasn't even born when the band's massive "Hysteria" was released in 1987.The only minor complaint I have is that the 3 bonus tracks are only available separately. Surely these could have been incorporated back into the concert. But don't miss them, because all 3 are as good as anything in the main event.This Crossroads is THE home video concert event of the year. Pick it up!

I acquired The Lady Vanishes as part of the (now out-of-print) 5-film Criterion "Wrong Men and Notorious Women" box set. And since I was not familiar with the film, I eagerly devoured the other 4 (The 39 Steps, Notorious, Spellbound, and Rebecca) and let this one sit on the shelf for awhile.Well, I've been kicking myself for that oversight, as The Lady Vanishes was simply wonderful! This is definitely one I will watch again and again. It's already my favorite Hitchcock British film (closely followed by 39 Steps). All of the hallmarks of the director's later, better-known American films are in there: suspense (including a surprisingly violent next-to-last scene), mystery, comedy (probably the most of any Hitchcock film) and a collection of memorable characters.There's a dry but informative commentary track that provides insight into the film, as well as background on many of the actors. And of course, there's a typically beautiful restoration job by Criterion.If (like I was) you're mostly familiar with Hitchcock's later films, I strongly urge you to pick up The Lady Vanishes.

I know Matchbox Twenty is not everyone's cup of tea, but there's no denying Rob Thomas' ability to wring new life out of an old cliche or two. SOMETHING TO BE may be a clear attempt at a different sound (or 5 or 6 different sounds...the disc is nothing if not unpredictable), but lyrically, Thomas remains in fine form. And even with help from the likes of John Mayer, Mike Campbell, former Revolution guitarist Wendy Melvoin, and the occasional gospel choir, this is still The Rob Thomas Solo Project. "My pain is a platinum stack/Take that sh** back" is just one reference (in the title track) to success that, more often than not, causes successful artists to take a look in the mirror.As for the rest, it's not hard to pick out potential hits, including a few that would fit on a Matchbox album. SOMETHING TO BE, though hardly a classic, is a comfortable reminder that there is still a place for earnest pop/rock and its eternal re-interpretations of a certain "L" word.And the DVD side is a gimmick that you'll play once and probably forget about. But I'm grateful to Thomas for including the "Christmas in New York" charity song.

For a longtime fan, The Hard and the Easy is quite a memorable feat. On the one hand, you could say Great Big Sea is playing to their strengths with an all-traditional album. But on the other hand, many of the songs here do not resemble anything they've ever done, even on traditional-heavy discs like the seminal UP or their eponymous debut.Although they've always leaned heavily (and successfully) on folk sounds, The Hard and the Easy breaks new ground for the band by being their first entirely acoustic album. The songs are lean, quick and at times vaguely familiar. The informative liner notes give the history of each tune. . .a welcome education for us faraway fans who may never set foot on the isle of Newfoundland.It's nice to see Bob Hallet getting a couple of tunes, and Sean McCann continues to improve at balladry, something he sometimes faltered at on Something Beautiful. His rendering of Graceful & Charming ranks with the band's best love songs.But for the most part, The Hard and the Easy is about having fun. The expected seafaring tales are there, but there is also further exploration of Newfoundland history in songs like Concerning Charlie Horse and darkly funny Cod Liver Oil. The Mermaid is guaranteed to put a smile on your face; Captain Kidd, Old Polina and the bittersweet Harbour Lecou are destined to be classics.I confess, I like GBS's original songs every bit as much as the traditional stuff. And UP is still the standard for providing a mix of the old and the new. Which is why I've given this release 4 instead of 5 stars. For other longtime fans, especially those who felt letdown by the more pop-oriented Something Beautiful, this album will be a 5-star one.And by the way, if you're new to Great Big Sea, this is a fine introduction. . .but there are MANY more joys to be found in their catalog. I'd recommend you get 'em all.One last note: The DVD included in this release is a nice bonus, mostly footage of the 3 guys playing and talking about their love of their homeland's culture. Best part: Singer Alan Doyle points out that The Hard and the Easy is perhaps the only album in history to include not one, but TWO songs about a horse falling through the ice! It's ultimately nothing groundbreaking, but fans will certainly appreciate it.

OK, I liked all the 3 previous Tremors films. Even when the budget sank lower with each successive sequel, at least the things were funny. Tremors 4, sadly, isn't even all that funny. The film is way too talkly, with very little action to speak of. Yeah, it's cool to see the beginning of the &quot;graboids,&quot; and Michael Gross deserves credit for his 180 degree turn from our beloved Bert Gummer. And the film isn't without its minor charms (the town of Perfection--as much a character in this series as Gummer himself--started out with the lamentable name &quot;Rejection&quot;), and those may be enough to satisfy die-hard fans.In the supplemental materials, the crew (and Gross) liken this film to the original Tremors. I sure hope they go back and watch the first film before making another one.

Man, there is just something about this cheap little flick. And that something is Bela Lugosi. Although he is essenially one character, that character plays 3 roles in the film. Part of the low-brow charm of BOWERY is that, at times, you feel like you're watching 3 different films. With that lean 61-minute running time, the action comes fast and the body count rises rapidly.Bela certainly made better poverty-row films (Devil Bat, Invisible Ghost), but BOWERY is still pretty entertaining.This is the 2nd release by the Lugosi Estate, and it's a keeper. The picture and sound quality are mostly top-notch (some of the exterior night scenes are pretty murky, but they probably didn't look that great to begin with). There's another audio commentary track by Bela Lugosi Jr. and genre critic Ted Newsome. You won't learn much about the movie, but Bela Jr. does have some great memories of his father to share. You also get another fun radio play starring Bela Sr., and 2 trailers for other Lugosi flicks.All in all, a must-have for Lugosi fans. Let's hope his estate will make good on Bela Jr.'s promise to keep 'em coming.

Man, I just can't go anywhere without my Gameboy Advance these days. Twenty years ago when I was pumping quarters into these machines, you could never make me believe I could one day put them all in my pocket!This Konami colleciton is a welcome addition to the other classic arcade compilations out there. All are very faithful translations, and most of them play very well on the small screen. The exceptions are Time Pilot and Gyruss, where you can often be killed by TINY unseen enemy fire. My personal fave is Scramble.For accuracy and playability, this is probably the best-yet arcade collection for the GBA.

I think Coppola's Dracula is best-appreciated if you have a good sense of Dracula on film throughout the years. He seems to have cobbled together many earlier ideas and somehow come up with a very pleasing result. The expressionistic use of light and shadows harkens back to Murnau's Nosferatu. The count's aristocratic bearing invites comparison to Bela Lugosi's signature role. And the more sexual aspects of the character's appeal could have been drawn from interpretations by Christopher Lee or Frank Langella.As someone else has pointed out, I've always had a bit of an issue with calling this "Bram Stoker's Dracula." I won't claim to have seen EVERY Dracula film, but I've seen an awful lot (and a lot of awful ones). And the fact is, "Bram Stoker's Dracula"--as a film--just doesn't exist. No one has ever done justice to the novel, despite many of them--including this one--lifting whole scenes from the book.It seems each new generation gets their own "official" interpretation of Dracula. For some of the best offerings of past generations, I suggest:Nosferatu,Dracula (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series),Horror of Dracula, andDan Curtis' Dracula.

I first came across this album in the late 90's, when a friend let me borrow a tape of it (on the reverse side wasUpby Great Big Sea, another album I strongly urge you to pick up). The music of Captain Tractor is a little hard to describe. There are strong Celtic overtones on songs like "Last Saskatchewan Pirate" and the traditional favorite "Drunken Sailor." But the band also delves into punk/pop with a revved-up version of the Clash's "London Calling." "Talk" is a lovely and somewhat gruff ballad about the importance of honesty in relationships. The band also evidences a sardonic wit in songs like "Lord of the Dance" and country-tinged "Jesus and the Thieves."If you're looking for a change from the same old recycled stuff on the radio these days, and don't mind occasionally using your brain while you listen to a CD, you should give these Canadian rockers a try.

Talk about beating the odds. Twenty-one films and some forty-four years into cinema's longest-running franchise, the Bond filmmakers have managed to redefine the character with resounding success. In fact, as of this writing, Casino Royale is the highest-grossing 007 adventure ever.I've seen them all, and I've always held onto the belief that Connery IS and ALWAYS WILL BE James Bond. But Daniel Craig almost made me forget Connery completely! Oh sure, the early Connery films are still great fun, and the sheer nostalgia of his era can't really be ignored. But THIS is Ian Fleming's James Bond the way he was meant to be: Cold as ice, infused with lethal cunning and nerves of steel.The real fun (and the real payoff for longtime fans) is watching how the writers, and Craig, slowly "create" Bond for the audience. [SPOILERS AHEAD] There's no Q branch, no Miss Moneypenny, almost no gadgets and precious few glib one-liners. But all the things that fans would come to love about the character are subtely laid out in the course of nearly 2 1/2 hours. And if that sounds like a long time, you obviously haven't seen the movie yet. Second-time director Martin Campbell (of Goldeneye, in which Bond was recreated in the person of Pierce Brosnan) piles on the action from the outset. The construction-scene chase alone packs in more mind-blowing action in 10 minutes most movies manage in two hours. And the scene that could have, in lesser hands, brought the action to a grinding halt (the poker game) actually provides some of the film's greatest thrills.Two minor quibbles that probably won't matter to casual fans: Considering this is a 2-disc set with many extras, why is there no trailer for the film? We get trailers for Spider-man 3, Rocky Balboa, The Pursuit of Happyness and others, but not Casino Royale? And I wish MGM/Columbia would have maintained the same package design as the previous Bond films, just so this one won't look kinda odd on the shelf next to my 20 other 007 adventures. But again, minor complaints.Even if you're not a James Bond fan, give this one a try. It's easily the best action film of 2006. And [looks around to make sure no one is listening]. . .Daniel Craig IS Bond!

If the above quotation from Christina Hart's character in GAMES GIRLS PLAY intrigues you, congratulations. You're just the kind of person for this movie.Scoring higher on the Cheesy Meter than a Swiss Colony catalog--and setting back the women's movement by at least a hundred years--there's little point in defending this seminal work of softcore yucks from the mid-70's. And that's the point, I suppose. It's so bad, it's good.Plot? Uh, o.k., sure. Man-crazy Bunny (Hart) is shipped off to an girls' school in England, where she proceeds to engage her roomies in a game of Bed The Politician. The bet is on and the clothes are off.Really. That's pretty much it.Directed by once-respectable veteran Jack Arnold (Creature from the Black Lagoon, It Came From Outer Space, etc.), GAMES GIRLS PLAY is best viewed as a product of its time. Personally, I first caught the film as a teenager on Cinemax's notorious "Friday After Dark" in the early 80's. If you came of age during that era, Bunny's exploits may hold a certain naughty nostalgic charm. And compared to today's smarter but far more cynical "adult" comedies, there's a goofy innocence about the film that might still win you over.The extras include the R-rated trailer as well as t.v. spots, and a painful modern interview with Christina Hart. Painful? Well, her memories of the film aren't all that fond, and (with apologies to Ms. Hart) she looks very different these days.The bottom line is simple enough: Either you're into this sort of thing or not. If, like myself, you have actually have fond memories of the film, you'll find it's really not that bad. As 70's teen sex comedies go, you could certainly do worse.

OK, it's a little premature to judge something that hasn't been released yet. And I'm sure I'll make a few additions to this review when the set is released. In the meantime, this review is meant to enlighten you about Series 5 of Doctor Who.I'm sure I wasn't the only fan who was skeptical that this lanky upstart Matt "Who?" Smith (Ha! Did you see what I did there?) could replace the wonderful 10th Doctor, played by David Tennant. But we long-time fans have come to accept that the role of the Doctor is going to change every few years. And in the case of Matt Smith, the role couldn't be in better hands.But Doctor Who doesn't just have a new face in front of the camera; Steven Moffat, writer of such modern-day DW classics like "Blink" and "The Girl in the Fireplace" took over the showrunner position from Russell T. Davies. And again, the show couldn't be in better hands. Moffat has been very vocal about his reimagining of the series as a sort of dark fairy tale. And this is evident right from the start, as the TARDIS crash-lands in the back year of 8 year old Amy Pond. The figurative monster under Amy's bed is actually a crack in her wall, one that will have cosmic consequences throughout the season.New companion Karen Gillan (playing the adult version of Amy) brings a spunky kick to the new Doctor's adventures. Yet one can still see hints of that lost little girl from time to time. Gillan and Smith perfectly compliment each other, as both appear wise and experienced far beyond their years. She almost immediately endures herself to the Doctor (and the audience, hopefully) in the 2nd episode, "The Beast Below," by preventing the Doctor from making a terrible mistake.The series touches on more familiar territory--the Daleks, the Weeping Angels, the mysterious River Song--yet stays firmly entrenched in the fantasy world Moffat has helped to create. As the bowtie-wearing Time Lord, Smith channels Doctors of the past from Patrick Troughton to David Tennant. He is, as Amy Pond notes in the first episode "a mad man with a blue box." And despite his seemingly unhinged nature, Smith gives the Doctor great dramatic weight when needed. . .whether it's righteous indignation at alien (or human) stupidity, or trying to protect his new companion from the inevitable fate that befalls all his fellow travelers.Doctor Who carries on in fantastic style, and I for one hope that Smith and Gillan stay with their roles for years to come. I congratulate Steven Moffat and his team for honoring the legacy of Doctor Who, but making it all their own at the same time. Highly recommended.UPDATE: As expected, the set doesn't disappoint. Doctor Who began filming in HD in 2009, and the Blu-ray format is perfect for capturing the gorgeous cinematography and excellent effects work. There are behind-the-scenes features for every episodes, some amusing outtakes, and a few commentary tracks. And this may be a minor point for many people, but the packaging is really impressive. The cover features a 3-D lenticular hologram, and there are 3 bonus art prints featuring the Doctor, TARDIS, and a Dalek. THIS is how you do t.v. on Blu-ray :-)

As an avid cartoon collector AND a child of the seventies, I was delighted when I first saw this collection on the shelves. Unfortunately, being a collector also means that I already had about half of the cartoons contained therein. Most of the titles here are from Hanna Barbera, and are availble on separate "complete series" collections. But still, it's hard to argue with choices included.I have very fond memories of watching shows like Speed Buggy, Josie & The Pussycats, and the Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (the only non-Hanna Barbera cartoon here, by the way) and eating a couple of bowls of cereal on those magical Saturday mornings. And that's the appeal of this set. It may be hard to get modern kids into silly shows like "The Funky Phantom" or the Charlie Chan one, but those of us watching them through the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia are willing to forgive their faults.On a technical note, Warner Bros. has included a disclaimer that not all of the shows are derived from pristine elements. I personally found them all to be quite acceptable, with the more high-profile shows like The Jetsons and Scooby Doo looking the best. With over 5 hours of content spread over 2 discs, you'll get your money's worth, even if a few of the cartoons aren't exactly HD quality.Bottom line: If you grew up watching these cartoons, you'll probably still get a kick out of them now. If not. . .well, you'll probably wonder what the big deal is.

If you're reading this review, you're either (1) at least 35 years of age (like me); or (2) curious about these old guys called Steely Dan that won a Grammy a few years back. For the first group of folks, order the album now. It's the curious others I wish to address...Go turn on the nearest radio. Find a "top 40" station. What do you hear? There's a really REALLY good chance you're hearing either Hip Hop or monotonous droning "rock". Either way, 30 years from now, nobody's gonna give a crap about it.Now we have Steely Dan. They've been around (over) 30 years. They've had plenty of hits, won Grammy's. And they're still around. Still relevant. And still making Damn Good Music.The point is, Everything Must Go, though incredibly familiar (and to be fair, some will say redundant) to SD fans, is still one heck of a breath of fresh air. It is more consistently enjoyable than their 2000 comeback album, and tracks like the ridiculsously funky "Godwhacker" and the title song are instant classics. I, for one, hope they win another Grammy and get their old butts back in the studio for another round. Donald...Walt...you're not getting any younger. Thanks for 40 minutes of delightful distraction.

One of the biggest disappointments of GRAFFITI BRIDGE--the movie--was that many of the great songs on this album weren't even in it. Flashback to 1990: The CD was released that summer, but the movie didn't come out until November. "Thieves in the Temple" was the lead single, a well-written rock number that called to mind "When Doves Cry."The first 5 tracks offer everything you could want from a Prince record: Rock (Can't Stop This Feeling I Got), funk (New Power Generation), a sense of humour (Release It), blues (The Question of U) and psychadelic pop (Elephants and Flowers). Things do start to take a detour of sorts when the Purple One lets the guest stars take center-stage, though. Tevin Campbell, Mavis Staples, and The Time are all talented artists. But their contributions here pale in comparison to what the Man himself had to offer.The exception is the George Clinton duet, "We Can Funk." Stepped in a classic p-funk groove, the track offers up some of Graffiti Bridge's most salacious lines: "You know the Karma Sutra?/I could re-write it/With half as many words." Or my personal favorite, as the song begins to fade: "People tell me I got no taste/Blow the candle out. . .we'll see if it's true."There's really no defending the MOVIE Graffiti Bridge, an amateurish vanity project that only about 14 people even bothered to see in the theatre. But the album has much to offer, and is worth another listen.

I'm glad to have Poltergeist 2 on DVD, as it's one of the better horror sequels. Most of the cast is reunited, and it somewhat succeeds at taking a minor point from the first film (the Native American burial ground) and creating the interesting character of Taylor, played by the late Will Sampson.But it's Julian Beck as the super-creepy Kane that makes this one worth seeing. You just might have nightmares after watching him do his best to cajole Carole Anne to the &quot;other side.&quot;On the flip side, the whole clairvoyant thing is overdone (Carole Anne has a connection to the spirit world, so her mother AND grandmother must have one too? Yeah...), and the ending is a pretty big letdown.And speaking of letdowns, just try to get thru Poltergeist 3. Poor little Carol Anne has been shipped off to Chicago to live with relatives (Nancy Allen and Tom Skeritt. Yawn.) but Kane (played by another actor since Beck had passed away) finds her. What then ensues are a bunch of cheap effects and ridiculous plot turns that insult rather than frighten. As you're popping the disc out after watching (or abandoning) the film, just remember: you got the infinitely superior Poltergeist 2 for a great price!

Like any rapper who lasts more than 15 minutes, it's a bit hard to separate fact from fiction in the world of Marshall Mathers/Slim Shady/Eminem. Luckily for us, the facts make for some pretty entertaining music. Assuming all that has been said in the press about him is true, one hopes these albums are cathartic for the boy.When you have 3 public personas, then you're bold enough to name your first 3 albums after each one, a pattern has to emerge. THE SLIM SHADY LP was a white underground rapper shooting for the big-time. THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP unleashed the genie from the bottle, yet its most resonant words (not from the fictional yet affecting "Stan," but from the title track) were probably Eminem's seemingly heartfelt, "I'm just Marshall Mathers." And it's this that forms the basis of many of THE EMINEM'S SHOW's finest moments."White America" inevitably goes too far, yet anyone with any sense of hip hop history knows its words ring true."Business" is the strongest of the many Batman references. And it's just damn funky song."Cleanin' Out My Closet" is the emotional centerpiece of the disc. And just when you're starting to feel sorry for Mathers, Eminem steps back in and tears into his mother with unchecked fury. "I would never dis my own mother just to get recognition," he says. It's up to you to decide whether that's true, but the song is unforgettable.Of course, we've heard in past recordings how much Em loves his daugther, Hailie. It's foregone conclusion that the child will someday end up in therapy, but give the man credit for one unexpected moment of self-censure: While juxtaposing his love for Hailie with his hatred for her mother, Em expresses gratitude that Kim didn't [edit] the child before she was born.Curiously, the weakest songs on the disc are the collaborative efforts with Nate Dogg, D-12 and Dr. Dre (except the flawless "Business"). Em may still be "down" with his homies, but he really doesn't need them at this stage in the game."I'll never be Marshall again," Eminem blares in "Solider." And he's right. This is, after all, The Eminem Show.

When you've been waiting for something as long as a lot of folks (myself included) have been waiting for "Mother of Tears," there's bound to be some disappointments. But let's talk about the good stuff first.From beginning to end, this is clearly a Dario Argento film. There's some great locations, over-the-top gore, a driving musical score (though this element is somewhat more restrained than it is in the director's now-classic works likeSuspiria), mystery and mayhem.However, being a Dario Argento film, there are also problems which are common to much of his efforts. The script, while nominally more linear than, say,Inferno, is still fairly disjointed. And the acting is uniformly bad, with the chief offender being Argento's daughter and frequent star Asia. I know, she looks great, but the offspring of Italy's most successful horror auteur is NOT a great actress.The DVD itself offers a few extras of note to Argento fans. A featurette on the making of the film offers a fascinating glimpse into the director's creative process, as does a brief interview with the man himself. An Italian teaser trailer and full U.S. trailer round out the extras.Outside of a sizable cult following, mainstream success has eluded Argento in the U.S. Sadly, Mother of Tears did not (in its theatrical release, anyway) broaden his audience. If you're a fan, it may help you to know that Mother of Tears is certainly a cut above his recent films likeThe Card Playerand the made-for-t.v.Do You Like Hitchcock?. For those who may be uninitiated into the world of Dario Argento, you'll discover a stylish and gory thriller. . .and probably not much else.

I know, we all have our favorite cartoons. And it's easy to nit-pick on the selection of 'toons in each volume. But, with the release of Vol. 4, there are still OVER 700 LOONEY TUNES that Warner Bros. can choose from. I think it's imperative that we fans continue supporting each release, in order to continue the Golden Collection series.Having said that, I would prefer that they stop giving each disc a single theme. I love these classic cartoons, but even I will have trouble sitting through 15 Speedy Gonzales cartoons in a row. Wouldn't it be more fun for viewers to mix it up a little? Or better yet, take a cue from the Columbia House Video Library, and give each famous cartoon director his own disc.OK, so I'm guilty of nit-picking, too. Vol. 4 is another treasure trove for classic animation fans, with incredible bonus materials. So come one, Looney Tunes fans! Grab The Golden Collection Vol. 4 so we can assure that "That's NOT all, folks!"

Hey, I still play the first Arcade Treasures all the time. So I was positively delighted to learn of this incredible new collection.Arcade Treasures 2 is a true sequel, in a sense, in that most of the games are from the late 80's and early 90's. There are a few exception to this, such as Wizard of Wor and Timber. Anyway, these later games are typically more complex and HARDER than the games on the first collection. This is a good thing, because it will likely take you awhile to master them. Which makes this disc not only a fun-filled blast of nostalgia, but ensures re-playability for quite some time. And that's why I find myself rating Volume 2 higher than the first. Sure, the previous disc arguably has more true "classic" titles. But I think I'll be spending more time with this one.Favorite games: Mortal Kombat 2 & 3 (now if only I could remember how to do all those fatalities...); NARC (best 2-player co-op action game ever); Wizard of Wor (for the funky early-80's speech synthesis); Total Carnage (truth in advertising...this game could cause a freakin' panic attack); Timber (I admit, I wasn't familiar with this one, but it's really charming and fun).I only hope other game companies will realize there is still a market out there for retro coin-op games (Nintendo, are you listening?) and give us more TREASURES, please!

Most Soap fans will probably agree that the show's second season ranks as its best. Not only do we get the full cast returning from season one, but there's John Byner as lovestruck Detective Donahue, and Donnely Rhodes as Chester's partner-in-crime, Dutch. Billy Tate finally gets a chance to shine. And Chuck and Bob's &quot;mindreading&quot; act has to be one of the most inspired bits of nonsense ever dreamed up by the writers in 4 years of...well, inspired nonsense.But...I don't want to give away too much. You just have to see for yourself the sidesplitting, often absurb moments...and the occasional heart-tugging ones. Robert Guillame picked up an Emmy. But my favorite actor, and character, is still Richard Mulligan's Burt Campbell.Confused? You won't be, after watching the 20-minute featurette, &quot;Creators Come Clean.&quot; Witness Soap creators Susan Harris, Tony Thomas, and the impossibly chatty Paul Witt wax nostalgic about casting the landmark sitcom. My only complaint about this welcome insight into the show is that NONE of the actors appear to offer comments. Still, you may recall that Season One had absolutely NO supplemental features, so it's still a welcome treat.Now...for the sake of Soap fans everywhere (and poor Burt Campbell...oops! I'm saying too much again) let's have Seasons 3 and 4 without delay!

First of all, let me say that I give DRACULA, the novel, 5 stars. Unlike many "classic" works of literature, it holds up very well today. Stoker spins a web of suspense, romance and drama that has rarely been equalled in popular fiction.And if you ever wanted to know more about Bram Stoker or his most famous story, The Essential Dracula is certainly everything its name implies. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, it mainly has to with the critcial asides that pepper the massive amount of footnotes in the book. As long as the editor sticks to illuminating historical facts about the time in which the story takes place, or offers helpful translations of words or phrases that are not part of our 21st-century lexicon, all is well. But he too often lapses into the role of critic, questioning characters' motivations or the logic of certain actions they take. Now, I'm not saying DRACULA is beyond criticism; it's NOT a perfect book. But I just feel too much time is spent on this, and it actually detracts from my enjoyment of the book.The inclusion of the orginal first chapter, "Dracula's Guest," is a mixed blessing. For the hardcore fan, it's an interesting find. But it doesn't fit well with the rest of the story. Most jarring is the fact that, although it's told in first-person by Jonathan Harker, it's not done in the form of a journal entry, like the rest of the story. And I didn't learn anything that wasn't already included in Harker's first few journal entries to Mina.On the plus side, I absolutely love the addition of recipes for the exotic meals on which Jonathan Harker dines. And the simple black & white illustrations are a welcome touch. Concise essays from famous (or supposedly famous...I haven't heard of many of them) fans speak to the novel's universal and seemingly timeless appeal.If you can stand the absolute overkill of information, this is definitely a must-have. If Leonard Wolf will just "trim the fat," as it were, future editions might just be perfect.

Like so many products of the 80's, The Gate succeeds more on nostalgia than actual entertainment value. But that's not to say it isn't worth watching. In fact, it's probably one of the best films of its kind: Low-budget, mid-to-late 80's PG-13 horror with a then-unknown cast, and a generous amount of special effects.What also strikes me about it, years later, is that the story itself more resembles an old-fashioned monster movie than a teen horror flick. I still get a kick out of watching the basic plot (kids inadvertently unlock a gateway to another dimension, unleashing demonic critters) tick by like clockwork. And it's all fairly inoffensive, though there are still a handful of decent scares.Even without the nostalgia factor, I think this is a fine kid's horror film. Great for a Saturday matinee or a Halloween marathon paired with TREMORS or Fred Dekker's THE MONSTER SQUAD (for which a DVD release is long overdue).

Although I'm a big Harryhausen fan and will probably eventually get all his films in the Blu-ray format, I do feel a bit conflicted about this release. Despite the overall vibrant colors and sharp definition--particularly in the bright outdoor scenes--there are still many scenes which appear grainy. The sequence where the Argonauts trap the harpies is especially murky.Having said that, I do feel that the HD format has spoiled us to expect pristine quality, and there may be times with these older films that it's just not possible. Unlike the TechnicolorThe Seventh Voyage of Sinbad (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray], Jason & The Argonauts was filmed in Eastman Color, which in many cases simply does not hold up as well over the years. But if Columbia was willing to invest the time and money in a full restoration, I have no doubt that the transfer could be improved upon.In addition to some nice holdover extras from the DVD release, there is a new commentary track with director Peter Jackson. An odd choice, since Jackson himself admits he was about 2 years old when the film was released. But it's clear that he's a fan, and he makes up for his lack of specific knowledge with his enthusiasm for the work of Mr. Harryhausen.For those who own the DVD already, the question is, is it worth upgrading to Blu-ray in this case? That's a tough one, because there just isn't a huge difference in the quality. Given the limitations of the source material, it's possible that the film will never look any better on the home screen. If you're a fan of the film or Harryhausen in general, you probably won't feel too bad about picking up another copy. Of course, if you don't already own it, it's a must-have fantasy adventure that holds up well to repeated viewings.

I know I'm not the first one here to say this, but let me join the chorus of voices taking Warner Bros. to task for another sloppy transfer. The whole point of Blu-ray is increased picture and sound quality, isn't it (the "increased durability" claim means nothing to those of use who put their discs back in the cases when we're done with them)? The really frustrating thing about this disc is that some scenes--especially those involving a lot of color--practically jump off the screen. But often the picture becomes horribly grainy, which probably looks bad on ANY t.v., but looks absolutely atrocious on my 52" HDTV.Even the extras are lacking. All you get is a commentary track, theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette. With the available space on a Blu-ray disc, plus the fact that there are additional materials on the film out there (as seen in the laserdisc release), the whole package seems nothing more that a rehash of the previous DVD release.For the unintiated, the film itself is a minor classic, although certain aspects haven't aged well. Feminists will run screaming at the blantant sexism (a feature common in the supposedly-enlightened future of the original Star Trek as well), and the bright pastel costumes might elicit a few chuckles today. But the story remains strong, the effects are very well-done, and the film does succeed in creating a believable otherworld of the future. And for those of us who came of age in the late 70's, there is a nostalgic charm (not to mention a briefly-nude Jenny Agutter) to keep things interesting. But until a full restoration comes along, there is really no reason to get this Blu-ray if you already have the film on DVD.

Pat Green has always been something of an anomaly in the music world. Too country for people who don't like country, but full of enough folk/rock grit to turn off hardcore country fans. Green has made his name largely through word-of-mouth and his energetic live shows. He's also released 3 very solid studio albums (with a handful of popular tunes getting played on CMT) and a few independent-label records.For CANNONBALL, it seems Green decided to try something a little different. Virtually gone are the raucous beer-drinkin', hell-raising story songs that were the hallmark of his earlier albums. In their place, we have a more mature, reflective (though, happily, never too somber) Pat Green. He still doesn't mine telling you about his checkered past--in "Love Like That" he refuses to judge a group of rowdy kids in a parking lot, because he knows he and his buddies were the same way--but he's also thankful for the love of a good woman to keep him on the right track. This theme resonates throughout CANNONBALL; and while it's not groundbreaking in terms of the songwriting, Green sings with such conviction that he can almost make the cliches seem fresh.The duet with Sara Evans, "Finders Keepers" is also a highlight, although the always-powerful Evans threatens to overwhelm her host at times. "I'm Trying to Find It" would be at home on a Bob Seger album. "Virginia Belle" is classic Pat Green, as he fumbles over the right way to introduce himself to a lovely lady. . .only to let the moment slip away.And of course, the first single, "Feels Just Like It Should," simply soars. In fact, it perfectly encapulates the album's theme, although none of the other tracks do it with quite such gusto.Like John Mellencamp (whose frequent producer, Don Gehman, produced Cannonball), Pat Green makes dependable, occasionally great heartland music. It's a fine progression of an artist who probably still hasn't reached his peak.

Popeye fans will immediatly realize this is NOT the classic character popularized by the Segar comic strips or the great black & white shorts made by the Fleischer Studios. These are, in fact, cartoons culled from "The All-New Popeye Hour," which aired on CBS in 1978. As such, they are colorful but rather bland interpretations of the spinach-loving sailor and his pals.The cartoons in this collection are:ABJECT FLYING OBJECTSHIP AHOYI WOULDN'T TAKE THAT MARE TO THE FAIR ON A DAREPOPEYE GOES SIGHTSEEINGCHIPS OFF THE OLD ICE BLOCKPOPEYE THE PLUMBERSWEE-PEA PLAGUES A PARADEPOLLY WANTS SOME SPINACHOne of the few good things about these shorts is that they feature Jack Mercer's final performances as the voice of Popeye. And they are at least as good as much of what Paramount did with the character in the 50's and 60's. But for the definitive animated Popeye shorts, be sure to check outPopeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Vol. 1andPopeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Vol. 2.

I really didn't think anything could top Universal's excellent "Legacy Collection" of the classic monster films. True, the initial collection was released to help promote Stephen Sommer's forgettable VAN HELSING film, but they were also a very impressive and affordable way to collect many of the studio's great monster movies.Now, for the 75th annivesary of Dracula, here comes yet another DVD release. . .the third release, in fact (Dracula was released on DVD in a single-disc edition in 2000). For fans who already own one or both of the previous releases, the question is obvious: Do you need another version of Dracula?Well, the answer is YES, you do! And here's why: As good as the Legacy Collection prints of Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. looked, Universal has actually improved upon the picture and sound quality for this release. But that's only part of the reason to upgrade. Several new bonus features enhance your viewing experience. In addition to the excellent audio commentary from film scholar David Skal (heldover from the earlier discs), there is an all-new commentary track from Steve Haberman. Haberman, the director of Mel Brooks' parody DRACULA, DEAD AND LOVING IT, might seem an odd choice at first. But he offers plenty of insight into the film's production, and spends an inordinate amount of time picking apart the Spanish production of Dracula, which many fans feel is superior to Tod Browning's film.Another bonus is "Monster Tracks," a running text commentary, in which trivia about the film's production appears on-screen throughout the feature. Much of the information is repeated from Haberman's commentary, and the track's writers take off on tangents that sometimes have nothing to do with what's happening on-screen (such as lengthy biographical information on director Browning). Still, even a die-hard fan like myself learned a few new tidbits about Dracula."Lugosi: The Dark Prince" is a fine documentary that was also included on Image's "Heroes of Horror" from a few years back. And I'm pretty sure it also aired on A & E sometime in the mid-90's. Lugosi fans looking for a more definitive overview of the actor should pick up "Lugosi: Hollywood's Dracula."Lastly, there's a great feature-length documentary on ALL the Universal Horror films. Well...maybe not quite ALL of them, but it's a fairly comprehensive program.I won't use up any more space discussing the merits of Dracula itself. If you're read this far, you know it's one of the defining moments of cinematic horror. And with this deluxe 2-disc set, virtually no stone is left unturned in celebrating its lasting impact. This is truly an essential purchase for classic horror fans, and probably for anyone else interested in the early history of sound movies.

I have to tell you, I'm something of a t.v. snob. I haven't really enjoyed a half-hour comedy since Titus was cancelled. All the dramas on t.v. seem to be doctor, lawyer, or cop shows (boring). And I'll set myself on fire before I'll waste time on a "reality" show on one of those prime-time game shows.So I was delighted to discover this little gem of a show on CBS's Monday night lineup. I initially tuned it because 2 of the 5 regular cast members were on two of the greatest t.v. shows ever: Alyson Hannigan from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Jason Segel from Freaks and Geeks. And I was just as surprised as anyone else when I soon realized the real scene-stealer was Neil Patrick Harris. Barney Stinson is a classic character, and it's a crime if Harris doesn't nab an Emmy nomination.It must be hard to come up with fresh material for a sitcom. . .but somehow, the writers manage to pull it off. Plus, the cast easily has the best chemistry since "Friends" (rivaled this season only by the cast of "The Class," another criminally-underrated show). Marshall and Lily (Segel and Hannigan) are TV's Best Couple.But let's talk Emmy's again for a second. "Drumroll, Please" is not only the season one highlight, I would rank in in the top 10 sitcom episodes EVER. In case you missed it (SPOILERS), Ted meets a woman at a wedding, and the two spend a perfect evening together while vowing NOT to see each ever again. You have to see it to get the full impact, but it's funny and touching and very original.Several people have complained about the DVD's being released full-frame. I don't personally own a widescreen t.v., and I don't know anyone who does. If it's that important to you, record the shows off the air. . .if you can afford a widescreen t.v., you can surely get a DVD recorder or DVR or whatever.We always look forward to Monday nights at my house. Now, thanks to DVD, we can watch this great show anytime. Watch Deal or No Deal if you must, but pick up How I Met Your Mother on DVD!

The first thing you notice about the new Matchbox Twenty album is how much it doesn't sound like Matchbox Twenty. Well, that's the first track ("Feel") anyway. As with the lead-off single "Disease", there's a bit more edge to the music this time out. Beyond that, you get Rob Thomas's patented baby-you're-no-good-for-me-but-I-gotta-have-you-anyway lyrics, mostly spun around undeniably catchy radio-ready hooks. Hold out past the last track, though, for a hidden song that wraps the album up with a bang.It's no classic, but if you liked their previous releases, you probably won't be disappointed.

It's quite a treat to have all the Bond films to date in HD, in one package. They were even nice enough to include an empty slot for the 2013 Blu-ray release of "Skyfall" (although a coupon for a free or discounted copy would have been icing on the cake). I bought all the MGM Special Edition DVD's back in the late 90's/early 2000's, and was impressed with the video quality even then. Well, most of these simply blow those releases away. Dr. No is 50 years old and looks like it could have been shot last year. If you've got a good home theater setup and like Bond, there's no question you must have this set.However, as others have mentioned, the packaging leaves much to be desired. It certainly LOOKS nice at first: Two hardcover DVD books in a sturdy hardcover shell. Then you open it up, and see that there is simply NO way to remove a disc without either tearing the package or getting your fingerprints on the playing side of the disc. I was further disappointed to find NO supplemental physical materials, such as an informative booklet filled with glossy photos. Even the aforementioned DVD releases had nice booklets detailing each film's production. This actualy extends to an overall gripe I have with Blu-rays: Do companies really think that movie lovers who care about movies enough to invest hundreds or even thousands of dollars on home theater equipment are really not interested in knowing more about the movies we love, and possessing some physical media related to them?For those who may not have bought the DVD releases but do indeed enjoy learning more about the movies, you'll be happy to know that almost all the discs have extensive bonus material relating to the individual films, and the Bond legacy as a whole. The Connery, Lazenby, Moore, and Dalton films each have nice 30 to 40-minute documentaries on the films themselves. Many, many other featurettes cover 007's girls, gadgets, guns, music, exotic locations, etc. For those with the time to explore them, it's a real treasure trove.If you can overlook the packaging deficits, it's a fantastic opportunity to own the very best quality copies of these films. I pre-ordered and got the set for $150, so I definitely think it was worth the money.

If I had every quarter I pumped into the original arcade games all those years ago...well, nevermind. What I mean to say is, I know these games backward and forward. And although these are decent translations, they are far from perfect. The main problem is the sound. The casual gamer probably won't be bothered by this, but to the arcade gaming purist, it matters.Still, this new and very affordable format holds promise. Let's hope future endeavors spend a little more time to get it right.Recommended for players looking for a nostalgia fix, but serious enthusiasts will likely be a bit disappointed.

OK, I'm a big Brooks & Dunn fan. But after rising above their peers with STEERS AND STRIPES and the excellent RED DIRT ROAD, their latest album is something of a letdown. One major criticism of modern country music is that it's all just so many cliches wrapped around the same old chords. And even some of B & D's best-loved songs are guilty of that. But there's just not enough originality on HILLBILLY DELUXE.The guys sound fine, and I for one always enjoy hearing Kix Brooks get to take the lead now and then. And Dunn shines on two slow numbers, the gospel-tinged "Believe" and more traditional "Again." And really, the album itself isn't that bad. I just think I've come to expect more. Except for the reference to P. Diddy in "Play Something Country," the entire album could easily have been made during the duo's early days. And that's not a compliment...they've come a long way since "Boot Scootin' Boogie."Brooks & Dunn are still some of the best music-makers out there, and they put on a terrific live show. I just hope by the time their next album rolls around, they'll look back on their past without reverting to it.

Even though I consider myself a huge science-fiction fan, I put off watching this one for a long time. This was mainly because of negative reviews I'd read, often citing the film's slow pacing. And while that prediction was accurate, the reviews I read missed out on a few other points, both positive and negative.Silent Running was directed by Douglas Trumball, the man responsible for the special effects in Kubrick's "2001". . .not coincidentally another visually-impressive but deliberately-paced film. I realize sci-fi fans are a finickly lot, so it may help you to know that I don't think 2001 is nearly as great as its reputation suggests. Beyond the visual splendor, it's a ploddingly dull film. Yes, it has some impressive ideas. But so does a good book.But back to Silent Running. Bruce Dern is the lone wolf eco-scientist trying to protect the last remaining forests of Earth, which are contained in ships orbiting the planet. His three human companions just want to get back home, and are delighted when they receive orders to nuke the floating foliage. But Dern's character--with the unlikely name of "Freeman Lowell"--strikes out on his own, and is indirectly responsible for an accident that costs his companions their lives.For the rest of the film, Lowell and a trio of robots try to find a new home for their precious cargo. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the film's final, poignant scene is probably its best moment.Now, about this pacing issue. It's true: Silent Running is more like Silent CRAWLING. But this is real science-fiction, not like today's action films with sci-fi elements thrown in. This is a film that rewards patience; and its ecologial message, though obvious from the start, is never over-bearing.Others have commented favorably about Bruce Dern's performance, but I have to say I disagree. I was never quite sure how to take the character of Lowell. He's passionate about saving the trees, yes, but it all seemed a little over-the-top. With his wiry hair and bug eyes, he reminded me of an unfunny version of Murdock from "The A-Team."Lastly, the only other real problem I had was the grating hippy-dippy tunes warbled by "singer" Joan Baez. I know I'm going to aggravate a lot of folk-singer fans, but she's just awful. And awfully inappropriate. In fact, outside of the bizarre and incongruent folk songs in Wes Craven'sThe Last House on the Left, this is easily the worst soundtrack to any seventies movie.If you're willing to overlook these flaws, Silent Running is pretty decent film. The story is original and intelligent, and the effects are first-rate. In short, if you liked 2001, you'll probably like this one.

As a fan of the original series, I have to say I was disappointed in the first two reunion movies. Trying to incorporate other Marvel characters into the (reasonably) "real" universe of the Bixby series just didn't work. OK, so this movie isn't terribly believable either, but Bixby gives his usual credible performance and the plot doesn't simply rehash the David Banner-on-the-run formula. In fact, as Banner himself comments, he actually gets to SEE his alter-ego for the first time (via videotape). And that's the real appeal of this surprisingly affecting story...not the dumb terrorist subplot.A sad end to a wonderful character, but certainly worth watching.

I'm too young to have experienced it firsthand, but the late 50's and early 60's must have seemed like a Golden Age to horror movie fans. And I can't think of many films of the era that deliver the goods more effectively than Circus of Horrors. While cinematic horror was still mainly suggestive by today's standards, Circus throws in a few graphic shocks that compare with the best of Hammer Films' output of the period.But the real joy of the film is in the casting. Anton Diffring gives Peter Cushing a run for his money in the "Mad Men of Science" category (if the comparison really intrigues you, be sure to catch Diffring as Dr. Frankenstein inTales of Frankenstein). And in the short-lived "scream queen" career of Yvonne Monlaur, her performance here is rivaled only by her leading role in Hammer's BRIDES OF DRACULA (available with 7 other Hammer horrors inHammer Horror Series (Brides of Dracula / Curse of the Werewolf / Phantom of the Opera (1962) / Paranoiac / Kiss of the Vampire / Nightmare / Night Creatures / Evil of Frankenstein).With today's anything-goes attitude in movie horror, Circus of Horrors may be a hard-sell. But for those of us who enjoy (slightly) more refined scares, it's still a treat.

I realize this biography was made in 2000, so when I say "missing", I'm not referring to stuff that's happened since then. After a very-detailed account of Springfield's early life, I was diappointed that not as much attention was given to his years as a pop star. Oh, the high points are there: "Jessie's Girl," General Hospital, the death of Rick's dad. But the documentary completely omits his 1983 and 1985 albums (Living in Oz and Tao, respectively), and gives very little time to his 1984 big-screen debut in Hard to Hold.I'm a longtime fan, and I have to admit that even I learned a few tidbits that I didn't know. And casual fans probably won't be bothered by the omissions here. Still, the price is kinda steep for a 50-min. program with no additional features. A collection of music videos would have been a nice touch.

Since the days of bargain-bin videotapes by labels like Goodtimes, I've always been wary of these "too good to be true" deals. Yet, as I am quite a fan of the films of Alfred Hitchcock, I couldn't pass this one up. And for the most part, I'm glad I gambled a few bucks.As of this writing, the majority of these films are still in the public domain and thus, not available from companies willing to spend the time and money on a proper restoration. It's worth noting, though, that some of the best films here ARE available in near-pristine condition in the 3-discThe Alfred Hitchcock Box Set (The Ring / The Manxman / Murder! / The Skin Game / Rich and Strange). Two are available in Criterion Collections:The Lady Vanishes - Criterion CollectionandThe 39 Steps (Criterion Collection Spine #56), whileAlfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inncan be found in a cleaned-up version from Image. For those who don't want to shell out the considerable bucks for all those, or if you're a completist (like me) who feels the need to possess EVERY film the man made, this is a good set to own.Audio/Video quality varies among the films, but I'd consider them all watchable. Since early sound classics like SECRET AGENT and RICH AND STRANGE aren't available in better condition elsewhere, I found the transfers here to be reasonably good. Hitch's best silent film, THE LODGER, unfortunately suffers some serious contrast issues.The real highlight of this set, however, is nearly an hour's worth of Hitchcock movie trailers. Oddly enough, none of the films contained in the set is represented with a trailer. But they cover much of the Master's career from 1940 thru the late 60's. And the quality on the trailers is far superior to that of the films.Bottom line: For all but the most discriminating viewer, this is a worthwhile purchase. Just don't expect the quality you'd get from the major companies.

Classic horror fans rejoice! Return of Dracula, though previously available on VHS, has been out-of-print for years. If you've never seen it, it's a suprisingly well-done black & white horror film from 1958.In a plot that, oddly enough, echoes Hitchcock'sShadow of a Doubt, Count Dracula (a sublime Francis Lederer) relocates to California to live with supposed relatives. And although it's unrelated to the Hammer Films' Dracula films of the same period, it certainly holds its own against those more-polished efforts. The vampire's demise is somewhat graphic for the time.The Vampire, while arguably the lesser film here, is by no means a waste of time. John Beal generates sympathy as a small-down doctor afflicted with the "disease" of vampirism. Fifties genre favorite Kenneth Tobey is on hand as the local sheriff. While both of these films are basically drive-in stuff, The Vampire's low-budget roots are more obvious, particularly in some laughably-bad make-up work.If you've been through most or all of the films in the Hammer, AIP or similar catalogs, you're in for a real treat here. Highly recommended for Return of Dracula alone.

Thursday nights in the mid 1980's were a special time for sitcom fans. Starting in 1984, NBC offered a killer lineup: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers and Night Court. Cosby may have had the most laughs, Cheers had an unbeatable cast, and Night Court was the underdog favorite. But Family Ties had humor AND heart, and stands out in my mind as the best of that bunch.But I'm getting ahead of myself. I realize TIES premiered in 1982. And I also realize that this first season was a bit rough around the edges. The juxtaposition of "hippy" couple Steven & Elyse Keaton with the Reagan-era 80's was the starting point of much of the humor. And some of it may be hard for younger viewers to understand. The ultimate irony of the Keatons' situation is that oldest son Alex was a card-carrying Republican, a living embodiment of the "establishment" that Steven & Elyse fought against in their own youth.Of course, Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton would become the show's breakout star. And with no disrespect intended to the rest of the cast, he probably deserved it. Fox seemed born to play the role that brought him his greatest fame. Even a less-than-stellar script (and there were a few of those in season one) could be bolstered by his presence.It would be a couple of more seasons before Family Ties would really hit its stride. But it's important to see it from the beginning, to watch all the characters grow (Tina Yothers in particular gets a lot less irritating in subsequent years). I hope season one sells well, so we can get on with the better episodes.And Paramount is quickly becoming my favorite distributor of full-season sets. Like the recently-released "Beauty & The Beast" set, they've managed to cram a full season in a single DVD snap-case.

It's hard to put into words the effect Beauty & The Beast had on a relatively small, but passionate group of people almost 20 years ago. I proudly count myself among them. But for someone who isn't all that familiar with the show, or even a casual viewer, re-creating the magic with words seems a daunting task.Once Upon a Time, Ron Koslow took the seeds of an age-old fairly tale and planted them in the modern urban landscape of New York City. At this time (1987) there were just the "Big Three" networks of ABC, CBS and NBC. Oh, there were cable stations, and Twentienth Century Fox was testing the waters with their own network. But the majority of primetime network dramas were formulaic "cop" shows or nighttime soaps like Dynasty. CBS took a huge risk on this odd little fantasy show, and placed it in what sci-fi and fantasy fans have come to know as the "kiss of death" timeslot: Friday nights.For its first season, the show was a moderate hit, moreso with critics (and the aforementioned loyal followers) than mainstream audiences. The romance between "beauty" Linda Hamilton and "beast" Ron Perlman was handled with intelligence and compassion. Here was a show that was not "dumbed down" to appeal to a wider audience. In addition to their romance, Koslow and a talented staff of writers created an entire world of great characters, most of them living beneath the city in underground tunnels.The show took a hit, however, when the writer's strike of 1988 delayed the start of the second season until December of that year. Most fans would agree that the quality of the episodes was never higher, but the ever-important Nielsen ratings were falling. To make matters worse, a creative "retooling" for the abbreviated third season--which saw the departure of star Hamilton--alienated many of the show's original fans.But that's another story.What is great about the show in general, and season one in particular, is the chemistry between the leads. I watch an awful lot of television, and I challenge anyone to find a better romantic pairing. Beyond that, this was a show that inspired many people to learn more about art, music and literature (all were featured prominently in the stories). Beauty & The Beast also featured an amazing supporting cast, including Roy Dotrice, Jay Acovone and the always-impressive Armin Shimerman (fans who only know him from his Buffy and Deep Space Nine roles may be quite surprised to see a much gentler side of this talented actor).Like I said, I watch a lot of t.v. And I can't really think of a show I can recommend higher than Beauty & The Beast. What started as a high-risk venture become a phenomenon which burned brightly, and all-too-briefly. They simply don't make t.v. like this anymore.Oh, and kudos to Paramount for the seemingly impossible task of cramming a full SIX single-sided discs into a standard DVD case! As a long-time home-video enthusiast, I take a certain perverse pleasure in being able to store an entire season of a show in less space than one single-episode videotape used to occupy.

It's almost universally acknowledged that the best Lugosi/Karloff collaboration was the 1934 version of THE BLACK CAT. Next to their signature roles as Dracula and Frankenstein, it's probably the best acting work either of them did for Universal. Personally, I would have gladly paid this modest price just for THE BLACK CAT.I think the biggest letdown of this bunch was MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. The brand name of Bela Lugosi was still at an all-time high when he made this film, along with WHITE ZOMBIE (for an independent studio). But the script is just dreadful. In a way, I suppose MURDERS foretold the low-budget horror cycle of the early 40's, which often centered around apes (?). . .and which, of course, often featured Lugosi.Though he's a supporting player in 3 out of the 5 features here, Bela holds his own against Karloff in the odd sci-fi thriller THE INVISIBLE RAY. If it lacks the sparkle and storytelling integrity of Universal's classic monster films, it still stands up well alongside the studio's horror output of the mid 30's ( e.g.,Werewolf of London, Dracula's Daughter)The remaining two films, THE RAVEN and BLACK FRIDAY, are low-budget programmers that succeed almost solely on the marquee value of their stars. Karloff would make more competently-mounted "mad doctor" pictures for Columbia in the forties; Lugosi would slide into Hollywood's "poverty row" with cheap (though, in the minds of many fans, more entertaining) fare like THE DEVIL BAT, INVISIBLE GHOST and THE CORPSE VANISHES.Karloff or Lugosi fan--and there's no reason why a person can't be BOTH--there's plenty here to enjoy. As with all Universal's classic films on DVD, the restoration is first-rate. Most of the films have trailers, but that's it for extras.For the price, this collection is a must-have for fans of these types of films.

You know, the Criterion Collection has long been a leader in providing classic films in the best possible condition, first on laserdisc and later on DVD. And when it comes to film restoration, they're certainly among the best companies out there.And yet, it is my feeling that the company is largely unknown outside a relatively small but dedicated group of film enthusiasts, whose passion for the art of cinema equals that of Criterion. Well, that, plus the fact that the company has largely focused their attention on foreign films that the mainstream moviegoing public has never heard of. Sure, there have been exceptions, such as their first-class Hitchock releases (Notorious, Spellbound, Rebecca and a few others); bona-fide classics like Spartacus, the Stones' Gimme Shelter; and a few oddball modern choices: The Royal Tennenbaums, Armageddon (?), The Rock (??).Which is why I was so happy to find a couple of cult sci-fi films in their catalog a few years back. Both the original version of The Blob (1958), and the sorely underrated Fiend Without a Face filled me with hope that maybe, just maybe, these folks were capable of something more. In fact, the trailers for all four of the films in this collection were included as bonus materials on Fiend.Now, the films themselves: The Haunted Strangler and Corridors of Blood are were vehicles for Boris Karloff, who was in his sixties when they were made. As he had done many times before (and would continue to do), Karloff plays a mad doctor-type. Corridors is the better of the two, with a young Christopher Lee in a supporting role as a ruthless killer. Neither film could really be called "classic," but both are solid, low-budget chillers that fans of Karloff and/or Lee will enjoy.The Atomic Submarine is more straight sci-fi adventure story, with the title vehicle facing off against an underwater UFO. Again, this is a "B" picture all the way, but it retains some charm in spite of an overuse of newsreel footage.First Man Into Space treads more familiar territory, as an organism from space inhabits the body of an astronaut. The thing craves blood, so you can guess what happens next. Not a bad little film, but probably the least of the bunch.I have to applaud Criterion for making these films available in pristine condition. I'm sure there is an audience for more of the same type of films. The only downfall to this collection is--as with all Criterion discs--the price.

Let me say upfront that I consider Max Shulman's "Dobie Gillis" to be a wonderful creation, an ahead-of-its-time sitcom that, oddly, is rarely discussed today. Although the characters were exaggerated, they were also more real than the typical 50's and 60's sitcom teens (and parents). A beatnik best friend? A dad who, instead of dispensing trite life lessons, was frequently prone to despairing to the camera, "I gotta kill that boy."? As the author is quick to point out, this wasn't "Father Knows Best."Someone once said it's not a good idea to learn too much about your heroes. And I think this book perfectly illustrates that. In sharp contrast to my fond memories of Dwyane Hickman as Dobie Gillis, the Dwayne Hickman of this narrative comes across bitter, depressed, and often mean-spirited. No doubt decades of show business ups and downs took a toll on the man. But the fact is, it's just not very entertaining reading.In "Forever Dobie," we learn that Hickman was a very reluctant child actor, forced into the spotlight in the shadow of his older, more successful (for a time, anyway) brother Darryl. He demonizes the nuns who ran the Catholic school he was forced to attend, and vents hostility about being mistreated by his brother. He recounts many tales of unhappiness on the sets of both Dobie and the earlier Bob Cummings Show. Nor was he very happy with his second career as a network executive.Probably the only Dobie cast member who comes out of this untarnished is Bob Denver--by all accounts a genuinely nice guy whose personality wasn't too far from either Maynard G. Krebbs or Gilligan (for a much more pleasant read, pick up Denver's ownGilligan, Maynard & Me). Hickman describes Frank Faylen, his on-screen father, as a grouch. He positively loathes Warren Beatty (although a cheap shot at the much-abused "Ishtar" was one of the few real laughs I got from the book). And while respecting her skills as an actress, he doesn't have much nice to say about young co-star Tuesday Weld (Denver actually echoes Weld's problems with fame and the press in his book, although in a nicer way). And although he claims to be setting the record straight about rumors of a long-standing feud between the actress and himself, one can't help but wonder about Weld's side of the story.Look, I know "tell all" books are big business. And Hickman, in all his "lives" has generally been a good Hollywood business man. I imagine "Forever Dobie" was even quite therapeutic for him. But the fact remains that it's little more than a 300-page bitch session, with some admittedly illuminating facts sprinkled throughout.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go watch my Dobie Gillis DVD's :-D

All the cuts here are great, and really help capture the sound of their era: Late 80's/early 90's "new jack swing" sound that was all the rage at the time. But the disc is missing a couple of tracks that no true fan should be without: "Born Not To Know" was the follow-up to their debut single, "Little Walter." And while it wasn't a big hit, neither were a few other cuts on this collection. A more essential jam is "House Party (I Don't Know What You Come To Do)" from the House Party 2 soundtrack. It's easily one of the group's best party anthems, right up there with their crossover smash "Feels Good."OK, those may be minor quibbles with an otherwise terrific collection. Like PM Dawn, the Tony's were ahead of their time, and too-often ignored by the public-at-large. But HITS is a fine (though incomplete) retrospective.

For those who don't like to read lengthy reviews, here's a one-word summation of my feelings about this release: WOW! Like many long-time fans of the movie, I'd been reading about the "lost" ending for many years. I kicked myself for not picking up the briefly-released 1998 DVD with the original footage included (the disc was quickly pulled off the shelf by Warner Bros., with second-hand copies becoming highly sought-after and VERY expensive collectibles). Over the years, I resigned myself to the possibility that I might never see it. And to be truthful, I was perfectly happy with the theatrical version, so I forgot about it.Well, Warner has finally done both the fans AND filmmakers a big favor in offering up this lovingly restored release of the cult favorite. And because the Director's Cut version probably won't be to everyone's taste (more on that in a minute), you even get your choice of viewing it or the original theatrical version (SPOILERS AHEAD). There's a brief featurette in which director Frank Oz discusses the changes, and praises the until-now lost special effects-filled finale supervised by Richard Conway, a very affable guy who seems delighted that his work can be seen at last. The package itself is very attractive, with a 36-page glossy hardcover book filled with great pictures and trivia about both versions of the film.For those who haven't seen the film in its original form until now, it's quite a revelation (again, SPOILERS and this is your last warning!). As promised by the studio, the final 20 or so minutes craft a MUCH darker finale. Having seen a stage production of the play in 1999, I can confirm that the ending mirrors it very effectively (although, as Oz points out, the deceased characters can't come back and take a bow at the end of a motion picture). And while I can understand why mainstream audiences in 1986 balked at the shocking, downbeat resolution, I think the ensuing 26 years of various real-life AND cinematic horrors have probably numbed most of us to the invetiable on-screen mayhem. It DOES place the film more firmly in the "horror" category than before, and I think that's a good thing. The "good guys" don't always have to win to make a story worthwhile or entertaining. As for Conway's contributions, they are very well-done in b-movie monster fashion. And they are blissfully free of modern CGI tampering (take THAT, Lucas and Spielberg).As for the transfer, it's not quite up to modern hi-def film resolution, but it's perfectly fine for a movie of this vintage. I played it on my 60" plasma with 5.1 surround sound, and was very satisfied with A/V quality. If you're a fan of the movie at all, this is really a no-brainer. And if you go into the altered version with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised at how much you enjoy it. It does change the tone of the film considerably, but again, I don't think it's a bad thing at all. Go on and pick this one up, it's Blu-ray done right. :-)

Fans of Alfred Hitchcock's more popular films like Vertigo, Rear Window and North By Northwest may be at first a bit put-off by the serious nature of this film. To be sure, the film is well-directed and generates some real tension. But that suspense comes not from breath-taking chases or fabulous set pieces, but from the investment the viewer puts into the characters.I admit I'm a huge fan of the Hitchcock colloborations with James Stewart, so I wasn't sure how well I would like Henry Fonda. But he is excellent as Manny...very believable and sympathetic. Even more impressive is Vera Miles as Manny's wife, who goes from adoring partner to a closed shell of psychosis by the film's end. In fact, I for one forgave the script's last-act change of focus (from Manny to his wife) because I was so caught up in Miles' performance. In all of Hitchcock's impressive body of work, only Vertigo has a more downbeat resolution.Although it's certainly not as technically brilliant as many of the director's better-known works, THE WRONG MAN is worth seeing for the excellent casting, and the fact that it's really unlike any other Hitchcock film.

Like many people here, I was practically salivating at the prospect of seeing this new vision of a beloved film. But I have to say, the end result was very disappointing. Here are just a few of the problems I have with it (Spoilers ahead):(1) Many of the "new" scenes go on way too long. The greatest offender is the stuff with Jor-El. Maybe you think more Brando footage is like some kind of lost treasure, I don't know. But I didn't learn anything new from the scenes, and I believe Brando just walked through the performance, with the promise of a big paycheck.(2) I think Lois's Niagra Falls test of her "Clark is Superman" theory is much more effective than Donner's scene. It's practically the first scene in the movie. Lois draws glasses on a picture of Clark, then figures she has enough evidence to throw herself out a window! Huh?(3) The finale...it's almost too painful to talk about. There is simply NO justification for repeating the SAME solution (spinning the world backwards) from the first film. In the first film, he turned back time just far enough to save the woman he loved. In Donner's cut of Superman II, he erases the events of the ENTIRE MOVIE. I almost expected Clark to wake up in his bed in Smallville. Heck, why not go even FURTHER back and bring his Dad back to life? It's lazy writing, and it cheapens the character.Now, believe it or not, I'm a huge fan of the Christopher Reeve films. And the one saving grace of this new cut is that we do get many restored scenes that don't appear in the theatrical version. And this alone might be enough to justify the purchase for hardcore fans. But for most everyone else, it's nothing more than a high-profile experiment.

Finally, I can use my Goodtimes DVD of Psycho 2 for a coaster! A belated thanks to Universal for finally giving this superior sequel a decent DVD release.As for the film itself, it's certainly one of the best sequels ever made. It's 22 years later, and Norman Bates is judged restored to sanity. He takes back his roadside motel from a sleazy manager (a pre-NYPD BLUE Dennis Franz), and takes in a seemingly innocent waitress (Meg Tilly). But even though Norman has put his past behind him, he starts getting notes from "Mother." And someone (Norman?) is dressing up like Mrs. Bates and soon the Bates Motel is back in business, 1960-style.There are a few surprises--although the identity of the murderer is fairly obvious long before it's revealed. Director Richard Franklin even throws in an admirable Hitchcock cameo! The pacing is deliberate and slow by today's standards, but the performances should hold your attention. Anthony Perkins deserves special mention for recreating his role as the screen's most sympathetic serial killer; his "toasted cheese sandwich" speech is probably the most emotional scene in all four PSYCHO films.Psycho 2 is a first-rate sequel, one made with obvious care and attention to characters...a far cry from the seemingly endless cycle of slasher films being released around the same time.

Well, this was my first exposure to the original Flash Gordon serial, after seeing clips of it for years and watching the laughably-bad 1980 feature film. I have to say that although I'm not ready to proclaim it a "classic," I was certainly entertained for four hours. And wasn't that really the point of this short films back in the early days of sound cinema? They packed plenty of action, colorful characters and outrageous situations into each 20-minute chapter.As a lifelong science-fiction fan, I got a campy kick out of the "science" in this one. My favorite line from the opening chapter: As Dale Arden begins to have trouble breathing as the rocketship carrying Flash, Zarkov and her blasts from Earth's atmosphere, Zarkov apologizes thusly, "Sorry...in all the excitement, I forgot to turn on the oxygen."If you don't mind leaving your brain at the door, or get a nostalgic thrill from such lurid theatrics, you could do a lot worse than this first Flash series.

It's about time Warner got around to releasing more of their Hammer films on DVD! As someone who has been waiting patiently for years to see a great print of this film, I find it hard (though not impossible) to find any faults with this release. Like WB's previous releases of Horror of Dracula, Curse of Frankenstein and The Mummy, pretty much the only extra here is a theatrical trailer.As for the film, I've always felt it was a bit underrated. DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS, the previous entry in the series, has been revered for reasons I've never fully understood. It's incredibly slow-moving, is almost entirely set in one location, and Christopher Lee doesn't even speak! At all! At least DRACULA HAS RISEN has a bit more going on, so to speak. OK, there's too much religious &quot;symbolism&quot;, which doesn't hold (holy) water upon even minor scrutiny. Sure, Drac just took a HUGE wooden stake to the heart...but ya gotta PRAY over it for it to work? Huh? The early scene in the church is creepy however; so much so, that not much else that follows it seems scary.On the plus side, there's the fetching Veronica Carlson, some fabulous sets (love those rooftop scenes!), and the ever-imposing Mr. Lee doing his blood-red-eye thing. Director Freddie Francis has been elsewhere maligned as being no Terence Fisher (Hammer's most prolific and arguably gifted craftsman). But Francis holds his own here, despite his over-reliance on filters and the occasional out-of-focus zoom.So, what we have here is this: A first-rate transfer of a solid entry in Hammer's Dracula series. Oh, and for the uninitiated, here's the complete series in order:HORROR OF DRACULA, BRIDES OF DRACULA, DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS, DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE, TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA, SCARS OF DRACULA, DRACULA A.D. 1972, THE SATANTIC RITES OF DRACULA, THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN VAMPIRES.And yes, I know BRIDES and LEGEND don't feature Christopher Lee. They still have Peter Cushing as Van Helsing and are part of the series.

Take the Weather With You gets off to a great start: "Bama Breeze" may be Jimmy's best song in a decade, with its typical witty lyrics and laid-back classic rock feel. "Party At the End of the World" is vintage Buffet, a paen to Tierra del Fuego, which the liner notes report is the southern-most part of the world (next to Anartica, of course). "Everybody's on the Phone" is another winner, mixing Jimmy's wry observations on modern convenieces (in this case, cell phones) with an irresistable sing-along chorus. The title track, a cover of Crowded House's "Weather With You," seems an odd choice, and really doesn't improve upon the original.Things get a little more conventional after that, with a string of well-performed but somewhat lackluster material. "Elvis Presley Blues" is a stand-out misfire, as Buffet actually seems kinda bored with song. "Regabilly Hill" and "Hula Girl At Heart" suffer from a similiar malady. A faithful rendering of Merle Haggard's "Silver Wings" is fine, although it would have been more at home on Buffet's 2004 country album, License To Chill.Take the Weather With You also brings us the inevitable Hurricane Katrina number, "Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On." Some great imagery about buying a watch from a street peddler is marred some less-than-subtle lines: "If a hurricane doesn't leave you dead/It will make you strong/Don't try to explain just nod your head/Breathe in, breathe out, move on."As I've said in reviews of previous Jimmy Buffet albums, hardcore fans don't really need reviews. . .they're going to buy the CD anyway. And the strong songs mentioned at the beginning of the review make this one worthwhile for casual fans.

I don't really have much to add to the glowing reviews above. This is simply the finest quality film restoration for a film from this era that I have seen. If you're a fan of Universal horror and/or Karloff you will treasure this film.I think all us classic horror fans should send MGM a nice &quot;thank you&quot; note for the attention they have given this fairly obscure 70 year old film. And perhaps they will be encouraged to put out more of the same. I suggest &quot;The Vampire Bat&quot;, made around the same time.Look at all those 5 star reviews....go get this DVD!!

While 1985 seminal SCARECROW remains the signature John Mellencamp album, THE LONESOME JUBILEE, in my opinion, is his greatest musical achievement. Both discs have a lot to say, lyrically speaking. But whereas Scarecrow scored the messages with 60's-influenced rock, Jubilee expands this sound to include more rustic instrumentation. The result is a pleasure to hear, as Mellencamp and his band effortlessly (or so it seems) make every song a keeper. Even potentially heavy-handed material such as "We Are the People" and "Empty Hands" (with one of my favorite lines, "They say people get what they deserve/But Lord, sometimes it's much worse than that") is served up with such conviction that it's hard to fault their earnestness.Unreleased material (the bonus track) is, of course, always welcome. But as someone has already mentioned, it sure would have been nice to have the b-sides from Jubilee's singles on the disc. Or even John's VERY SPECIAL CHRISTMAS contribution, "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus," which was released shortly after this album came out.But I've still got my treasured 45's, so I can live with it. In any event, if you only get one Mellencamp remastered disc, this is the one.

It's rare that I review an item that already has so many reviews (and some very fine ones, I might add). But I just watched the complete Smallville season six over a 3-day period, and I felt compelled to add my comments.I can't remember when I've enjoyed a series of television so much. The show had already matured quite well by its fifth season, but this year it really kicked into high gear. I admit, I was slow to warm up to Oliver Queen and his super alter-ego Green Arrow. I was thinking, "C'mon, can't the writers think of enough for Clark to do?" But by the time Queen brought together all the young Justice Leaguers in the episode "Justice," I knew that I would miss him when he was gone.And not to take even more away from the future Man of Steel, but two other series regulars really got a chance to grow this year. Lois was given a love interest, which nicely rounded out some the charater's rougher edges. And Allison Mack as Chloe had her best year yet, getting a meaty subplot (not to mention a boyfriend) of her own, and becoming more intergral than ever in helping Clark embrace his destiny.As I said above, I watched the entire season in three days. So it's hard for me to really pick a single favorite episode. There's basically 2 or 3 ongoing story arcs, with nary a weak link among them. As always, the season finale leaves you on the edge of your seat. In this case, it includes the debut of another super-villain from the comics.Season six is Smallville at its best. Highly recommended!

Like many Queensryche fans, my first reaction upon hearing about this sequel album was, "Why?" OPERATION: MINDCRIME seemed like a complete story to me, and a great one. But even after the first listen, I realized a sequel was not only justified, but surprisingly relevant. Much of the original album's lyrics took aim at Bush-era (that's the SENIOR Bush) politics and capitalism in general. Now, 18 years later...how much has changed, really? We've still got a Bush in the White House, and...well, let's not get off-topic here.When we last saw our protagonist, the chemical-fueled assasin Nikki, he was locked away in an asylum and just beginning to realize he had been a pawn in the evil machinations of "Dr. X." Eighteen years later he is being released. And thus begins OPERATION MINDCRIME II.But what does society have to offer him? Is he just a killer, or could he become something more? These questions drive the album, in an increasingly dramatic and dynamic fashion. Nikki blames Dr. X for the death of his lover, Mary, and steadily begins to plot X's death in "One Foot in Hell" and "Re-Arrange You." But society has labeled him crazy ("Hostage"), and Nikki wonders whether things will ever change. Is revenge his only option? This dichotomy (free will vs. predetermined fate) drives much of the album. In "Speed of Light", Nikki confronts the changes in the world over the past 18 years. Convincing arguments from hallucinations (or his therapist? Or the "ghost" of Mary??) make him believe that even though the world has changed, he has not.Mr. X himself is given voice in "The Chase," as he taunts Nikki with claims that our hero is "nothing." Mary's spirit permeates "If I Could Change It All," leading Nikki to again (in "A Junkie's Blues") to contemplate "What if I wasn't too blame? What if I could change?" The pentultimate track "Fear City Slide" finds our boy contemplating suicide. It is unclear whether he follows through, however; an album-closing duet with Mary could be seen as her final plea for Nikki to live, or her way of welcoming him to the afterlife.Quite a story. And yet, it does fall short of its predecessor on several counts. First, there's just not enough variety in the lyrics. I'd estimate 70% of the songs cover basically the same territory: Can a supposedly rehabilitated killer change? Another problem is Mary herself. For a dead woman, she sure gets a lot of time at the mic. Look, if you're listening to OPERATION MINDCRIME II, you know the story of part 1. I just found Mary's presence on the disc to be excessive and mostly unnecessary.Musically, there's little to complain about. MINDCRIME II sounds like it was recorded about a week after MINDCRIME I. The music is familiar, but with this band, that's not a bad thing. You want a different Queensryche sound? Try Q2K or TRIBE.To sum it up, this was a pleasant surprise for the most part. Even without Chris DeGarmo's formidable presence, the band sticks kicks hard. It's easily their most cohesive and best album since 1994's PROMISED LAND. Recommended.

Whatever the future holds for the world's greatest superhero, 2006 will surely be remembered as one of the greatest times in history to be a Super-fan. In addition to the terrific Superman Returns, we've seen a real "return" of the character to our t.v. screens as well. With the release of these serials, we now have ALMOST every filmed version of the Man of Steel at our fingertips (still M.I.A.: the cool 60's animated series).I'm too young to have seen serials play in the theaters back then, but what a treat it must have been! These admittedly low-budget adventures were packed with action and interesting characters. Much has been said about the money-saving animated flying effects, but I still think they're cool. These things were designed for the big screen and aimed at kids. . .not for today's superior digital clarity and the ability to freeze a single frame of film with the push of a button.Of the two serials, ATOM MAN is clearly better. For one thing, it affords Superman much more screen time. Often in the first serial, Supes would perform some heroic deed (like saving Lois or another character from the previous week's cliffhanger) and then disappear for the rest of the chapter. The other benefit of ATOM MAN is that it features Lex Luthor (though only his surname is used), something the (admittedly better) George Reeves series didn't manage in six whole seasons.Since the Superman serials have been largely unavailable for years--and can now BOTH be purchased for less than what I paid for ONE of them on VHS some 10 years ago--this a great opportunity for fans to complete their collections.

Just when I think Criterion has forgotten us fans of horror & sci-fi, here they come with this incredible deluxe treatment of one of the all-time greats. Carl Dreyer's VAMPYR may have been overshadowed by Murnau's NOSFERATU and Tod Browning's DRACULA (and rightfully so, in many ways), but it's still one of the greatest examples of film-as-nightmare ever made.For those who may have missed it, VAMPYR loosely (VERY loosely...more on that in a minute) adapts the Victorian-era horror tale "Carmilla," which featured a pair of scheming female vampires. But the film only uses bits of the novella to flesh-out its nightmare vision. The film's minimal plot concerns a man, Alan Gray, who is studying the occult. In a village outside of Paris, he stumbles upon a mystery steeped in the supernatural. A host of increasingly bizarre images assail Gray (and the viewer), culminating in one of the most memorable nightmare sequences ever put on film.VAMPYR, especially for the first-time viewer, can be a difficult film to embrace. Dialogue is kept to a minimum, and when it does occur, is often puzzling. The narrative is disjointed, resulting in sometimes abrupt cuts and images which don't seem to fit. Most disconcerting is a shot of a gravedigger which has been reversed, or the shadow of a solider which seeks to rejoin its host. All these scenes and many more give the film its nightmare logic, which is all the more memorable for what it DOESN'T show.For all their technical wizardry, I've almost always found Criterion Collection discs left me wanting more in the way of supplemental materials. Well, with VAMPYR. . .all is forgiven! Disc 2 offers a fascinating "visual essay" which recounts director Carl Dreyer's influences that helped shaped the film. There's also a 1966 documentary on Dreyer himself, covering his first silent films up to his final effort in 1964. There's some great archival footage of Francois Truffaut and others offering their insight into the director and his films. Back on Disc 1, you'll find a rather droll audio commentary by British film scholar Tony Rayns. While his observations do occasionally help make some of Dreyer's creative intentions more clear, Rayns spends too much time engaged in idle speculation over such trivia as the proper pronunciation of "Carmilla" author Sheridan Le Fanu's name.As if that wasn't enough, VAMPYR also includes a nice full-sized book that contains not only the original screenplay, but the entire text of "Carmilla." Reading them back-to-back, one can easily see how Dreyer was influenced but not really guided by the original story. Lastly, a booklet includes additional essays about the film and its resoration.Simply put, anyone interested in classic horror, or the history of early sound films MUST have this terrific set in their collection. Criterion is to be commended for pulling out all the stops and crafting what I'm sure will prove to be a treasured archive of an often-overlooked piece of film history.

Universal has given IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE the same quality treatment it gave their initial batch of &quot;Classic Monsters&quot; titles. The 30 min. documentary is wonderful, covering not only this movie, but other 50's sci-fi flicks. The Tom Weaver commentary is informative, and he is one of the more pleasing &quot;historians&quot; to listen to.And then of course, the film itself has never looked better. If you're a fan of 50's sci-fi, this has to be an essential component of your collection.Now. . .how about a deluxe treatment for THIS ISLAND EARTH??

As someone who bought the orginal Image DVD release of this film in the late 90's, I've felt bad for any sci-fi fan who missed out (and who doesn't want to pay 100 bucks or whatever the going rate is for a used copy). And the truth is, the print used on the Image disc really wasn't that great. Plus the Image DVD had absolutely no extras. But THIS ISLAND EARTH is discussed in the Universal sci-fi documentary included on IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE.Now, on to the movie. I have fond memories of staying up with my older brother and catching this one on "All Nite Movies." This was before DVD or VCR's. If you wanted to see a classic sci-fi movie, you simply had to STAY AWAKE long enough to watch it. And this one was worth the wait. Everything you could hope for in a fifties science fiction film is here: Interplanetary travel, space battles, a mutant creature, scientists in love. And what is too-often not mentioned when discussing THIS ISLAND EARTH: The story is intelligent and thought-provoking.You see, aliens from the planet Metaluna are recruiting Earth scientists to help them produce atomic energy to fight off attacks from the another race, the Zaghons. The Metalunans are an advanced race, but the Zaghon attacks have virtually destroyed their planet. This is documented in the brief but highly effective tour of the dying world, a masterpiece of art direction and special effects that was surely cutting-edge in 1955.A capable cast of 50's genre regulars is on hand: Rex Reason, Jeff Morrow, Faith Domergue and Russell Johnson. But the real stars of THIS ISLAND EARTH are the colorful effects, which (according to publicity materials) were 2 1/2 years in the making! With the possible exception of FORBIDDEN PLANET, no fifites sci-fi flick delivers "the goods" like this one.Universal has done a fine job of presenting THIS ISLAND EARTH is "out of this world Technicolor." The colorful visit to Metaluna certainly highlights this, but when comparing this disc side-by-side with my Image version, ALL the colors look brighter. Even Exeter's mansion comes to vivid life, with details that may have been overlooked before now. It's nice to also have the rarely-seen theatrical trailer (a fact that is mentioned nowhere on the DVD case, by the way).THIS ISLAND EARTH certainly belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection. For great memories and grand entertainment, assemble your interocitor and take a trip to Metaluna.You don't even have to stay up all night. :-)

Note: This review is for the single-disc Warner Bros. 2006 DVD release of Supergirl. Amazon continues to lump together all reviews of a film, despite the fact that this is the 3rd DVD release of this film (and the first from WB).Some films don't age well. Some weren't that good to begin with. Supergirl, sadly, falls into the latter category. Nevertheless, the film isn't a complete waste of time. Helen Slater does her best with the incomprehensible script. And the flying sequences are best of all the big-screen "Super" films. No CGI here, folks. This is 1984, and that's really Slater (or her double in the long shots) up there on wires.The film was previously available from Anchor Bay in an extended addition, with 24 extra minutes of footage edited back in. This WB release is the "European version," with 10 additional minutes added to the theatrical cut. The extra stuff doesn't amount to much; it's mostly extended scenes with Faye Dunaway and Peter Cook. Only hardcore Supergirl fans (if there are any?) will care about these minor changes.Despite its many flaws, the film LOOKS great. For that, plus the great flying sequences and Helen Slater, I give it 3 stars.

FANTASTIC VOYAGE has always puzzled me a bit. Well, not the movie itself, but the seeming lack of critical or popular accolades it has been given. Growing up in the seventies, I recall it was a staple of "All Nite Movies" on the only channel we received that stayed on all night. And the film was just a marvel to my young eyes: A team of scientists, including the incomparable Raquel Welch, is miniaturized and injected into the bloodstream of a comatose patient. What follows is a colorful and thrill-packed journey inside the human body. The crew of the Proteus encounters the body's natural defense systems, nearly gets smashed by the awesome force of the beating heart, and has to repair damaged blood vessels in the brain.Doesn't that sound great?It is, but like I said, for some reason the film is rarely talked about, even among hardcore classic science fiction fans. Be that as it may, 20th Century Fox is finally giving this often-overlooked film the deluxe treatment. Previously availabe in a double-feature disc withVoyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Global Warming Edition--which is also getting a bonus-filled overhaul to coincide with this release--Fantastic Voyage can now be enjoyed and appreciated with a wealth of supplemental materials.Except for the theatrical trailer, all the extras included on this disc were created especially for this release. There's a documentary on the film's production, audio commentary track, isolated music track, and a cool feature (comprised of both video and still picture segments) on the film's props.Whether, like me, you're revisiting some great childhood memories, or just discovering this intelligent and exciting film for the first time, this is one VOYAGE worth taking.

There are plenty of reviews here giving you the details of the film's plot, so I'll be brief here. This was my first exposure to this well-made and fairly creepy film from 1972. Even though it's not a Hammer Studios production, it certainly will appeal to fans of Hammer, with the studios' two biggest stars and one of its better directors.Like many films of its era (including Hammer ones), the pacing might be a bit slow for some modern viewers. But the payoff in this case is worth the wait. In addition to a genuinely scary climax, the twist ending is quite memorable. Add to that solid performances, a suprisingly literate script, and a handful of gooey effects, and The Creeping Flesh is solid entertainment for fans of this kind of material.The print used for this DVD is quite good. I play all my movies on a Blu-ray player and 52" screen, and I can't really think of anything bad to say about the picture or sound. A theatrical trailer is the only extra.

Finally, Robert Wise's seminal haunted house film comes to DVD. And as a special treat, Wise himself reunites with most of the cast for an enjoyable commentary track. There's also a text-only essay on other spooky films, which is informative but far too brief.If you've never seen the movie, be warned: This is SUGGESTIVE horror. It's all about what is NOT seen (but occasionally HEARD, in some genuinely chilling scenes). It's a much a psychological study of the characters as a ghost story. But if you appreciate this kind of imaginative approaching to cinema, you're in for a scary good time.

Danny Wilson is quite an oddity in the world of pop music. Almost no one knows who they are today, and not many people knew who they were in 1987, when this album was released. There were plenty of here-today-gone-tomorrow pop bands at the time: Anyone remember T'Pau? Bourgeous Tagg? Johnny Hates Jazz? Well, you're not alone if you have no idea what I'm talking about. For the most part these synth-heavy, lyrically pretentious groups are best forgotten.But not so with the trio called Danny Wilson.As has been stated by others, the music of Danny Wilson is basically intelligent, well-played, adult pop music. The Steely Dan comparisons are inevitable, and fairly accurate. Both feature complex, jazz-infused instrumentation, thoughtful and sometime puzzling lyrics, and passionate vocal performances.I won't take time here to discuss each track separately, because they are all basically well-made and hold up to repeat listening. If you're not familiar with the band, the only track you might know is the single "Mary's Prayer," as pure and perfect a pop confection as you're likely to ever hear. But it's also just the jumping-off point for an album's worth of expertly crafted songs.Highly recommended.

I've always felt Earth vs. the Flying Saucers never got the attention it deserves. Perhaps because of its outlandish title, so-called "serious" science fiction film fans have largely ignored it. And that's a shame. Because I think it ranks right up there withThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition),It Came From Outer Spaceand other acknowledged classics of the genre.The plot is straightforward enough: Aliens attack our planet, and it's up to the miracles of modern science to save us. Sure, there's the requisite scientist-in-love-with-the-general's daughter subplot. But there's also Ray Harryhausen's spinning saucers, laying waste to everything in their path. In fact, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers is one of the few films of its kind that actually DELIVERS on the promise of an all-out alien attack. Yes, there's a b-movie budget, complete with some stock footage of planes and such. And the aliens' death rays aren't terribly convincing. But such are the limitations--and charms--inherent in 50's drive-in sci-fi flicks.As for the DVD, it's a first-rate job all the way. A whole extra disc is devoted to numerous bonus features. Harryhausen--still spry well into his eighties--offers detailed recollections of working on the film (he also provide audio commentary for the film on Disc 1). There's a very interesting documentary on screenwriter Bernard Gordon, a Harryhausen interview conducted by a somewhat gushing Tim Burton, an engaging inteview with star Joan Taylor, a featurette on the film's music, and various still galleries.Now, for the curious. . .I must address this colorization issue. Earth vs. the Flying Saucers was filmed in black & white. I, like many of you reading this, I suspect, grew up watching the film in black & white. And having watched the new colorized version, I still prefer the film in its original form. Despite the offical approval of Harryhausen, as well as documentary on the supposed improvements in colorization technology. . .I still don't think it looks that great. Specifically, no one has ever been able to get caucasian flesh tones exactly right, and fire always comes out too yellow. For those that think Harryhausen's "seal of approval" is enough to justify this change in the film, I refer you to recall the comments of two other fantasy-film masters: George Lucas and Steven Speilberg both felt modern technology could improve existing prints of STAR WARS and E.T. But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who agrees that end-products were improvement upon the originals.But, color or b & w are ultimately personal preferences. Either way, this is a terrific treatment of an often-overlooked classic sci-fi film. Buy it!

After reading numerous blurbs about how Ben Bova's novels were a return to the "hard" science fiction popularized by Heinlein, Asimov and Clarke (my personal favorite), I have to say I was really let down by this book. While the science may be more or less sound, the fiction leaves much to be desired.The main problem is that Mercury is essentially a story about betrayal and vengeance that, almost as an afterthought, happens to take place on or around the planet Mercury. The main revenge plot is spelled out for the reader early on, so there's no real mystery and only a minor bit of suspense to keep the story moving.Other reviewers have stated that the book is not Bova's best, and I might be willing to give him another try. Hard sci-fi has been on life support (or maybe suspended animation?) for years. I'm just grateful that, as of this writing, we still have Arthur C. Clarke alive and still writing.

First of all, let me say how much it pains me to give this anything less than 5 stars. I consider "The Nightfly" to be my favorite album of all time, period. And the two subsequent Fagen solo discs would probably make my Top 10 list as well. And releasing them in this cool MVI format makes perfect sense for an artist who has always been forward-thinking as both a songwriter and musician.But let me get this out of the way: The CD's (NOT the MVI DVD's, mind you) of Nightfly and Kamikiriad do NOT appear to be remastered. If you play them back-to-back with the original CD pressings, there does not appear to be any difference. For a more jarring confirmation of this theory (and it is, ultimately, just a theory I guess), put all 3 albums in a CD changer and notice the sonic difference between Morph the Cat and the other two. Even the impressive "10 Extras" disc sounds better by comparison. The MVI discs are fabulous--I'll get to those in a second--but for the money, and considering how much time has elapsed between the original CD releases and now, it seems odd to me that this set seems to include nothing more than the original discs with new label on them.Now, if you're a fan of Donald Fagen at all, there's no question that the MVI discs are gonna rock your world. As others have pointed out, you simply haven't heard these albums until you play them in 5.1 surround sound on a home system. Words do not do this thing justice, you literally have to hear it for yourself. And considering that you NEVER see Fagen's handful of music video clips anywhere, it's quite a treasure to have them here. "Snowbound" could be the strangest video I've ever seen. And I mean that in a good way.All of the bonus tracks, save for the 2 live ones, have been previously available. But having them all on one disc is great. Unlike most artists' "b-side" material, this stuff is every bit as good as his commericially-released tracks.The other complaint I have is that none of the albums' original liner notes have been reproduced. I've always felt that, in the case of Donald Fagen, the notes always greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the songs. All 3 of the original discs are "concept" albums, and Fagen's personal notes help flesh out the pictures his words and music create.Bottom line: Despite the disappointments detailed above, this is still a must-have for Fagen fans.

I was fortunate (REALLY fortunate, I live in the Southern U.S.) to have seen Great Big Sea on this tour. In fact, the material for "Courage & Patience & Grit" was recorded just over a month after I saw the band play. So I can say with certainty that this is a pretty close approximation to what I saw.A previous reviewer complained that the boys look tired. But the album's liner notes reveal that the Hard and the Easy tour was divided into 2 parts: The first half is the more intimate, folk-based side of the band. The 2nd half really kicks things into gear.This is GBS's third live album, and I was delighted with the 2-part concert approach. Old favorites like "Excursion Around the Bay" and "Mari-Mac" never sounded better, while a stripped-down "Sea of No Cares" is simply breathtaking.In addition, there are 4 music videos that were not available on the excellent "Great Big DVD" collection from 2004. Longtime fans will surely be thrilled to have the video for "Lukey", which includes members of the Chieftains (and is a different mix of the song than previously released). The video clips for "Shines Right Through", "When I Am King" and "Captain Kidd" are mostly in the same vein as the band's other videos. That is, they're pleasing enough, if not exactly groundbreaking.If I have one minor complaint about this set, it's the audio CD of the concert. Part of the charm of the band's live sets is their connection both to the audience and to the other band members. This is evident on the DVD, especially Alan and Sean's playful banter leading into "The Mermaid." This is completely absent on the CD (as are four of the concert's songs, a necessary concession due to the limitations of CD recording). But the real problem is that I noticed small gaps in between each track. This is irritating in that it breaks the continuity of the "live" recording. A minor point, like I said, but it just means I probably won't be playing the CD nearly as much as I do my "Great Big DVD" live CD.If you're a fan, this is certainly a worthwhile--and very reasonably-priced--addition to your collection. It's not quite perfect, but it's ALMOST as good as the "real thing."

During the home video revolution of the mid-to-late 80's, a low-budget film company called Full Moon Entertainment helped usher in a new genre of films: The direct-to-video feature. These are commonplace today, and often are comprised of cheapskate sequels to successful feature films. I'm not sure if Full Moon was the first company to take this approach, but in the late 80's and early 90's, they did it often and did it. . .well, pretty well. And they wore their low-budget suits like a badge of honor--they were certainly among the first companies to pack their VHS releases with exclusive "making-of" documentaries and sneak peeks at upcoming projects.For the unintiated, the original TRANCERS (1985) was, in fact, released theatrically in the U.S. The film, set in the near future, was an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of THE TERMINATOR. A future cop with the unlikely name of Jack Deth (Tim Thomerson) is sent back through time to protect the ancestors of present-day judges who will sentence a criminal named Whistler to die. Whistler himself pursues Deth, who is befriended by a woman named Lena (a young Helen Hunt). Oh, and Whistler is also creating an army of zombies--"Trancers." It's all done on the cheap, but works surprisingly well. Thomerson is a wry anti-hero--think Kurt Russell's Snake Plisksen if he cared about grooming ("Dry hair is for squids.") and you'll get the picture.The direct-to-video sequels began in the early 90's, as Full Moon honcho Charles Band was cranking out such cult items as Dollman, Puppet Master and Demonic Toys. TRANCERS 2: THE RETURN OF JACK DETH reunites most of the cast, as Jack struggles to free his thought-to-be-dead wife from a cult. Helen Hunt returns briefly for TRANCERS 3: DETH LIVES, which finds Jack taking on an alien partner named Shark. The back-to-back 4th and 5th installments send Deth and Shark back to medieval times.Even though I'm a fan of this quirky series, I'll be the first to admit that the quality really decreased with each successive film. The Jack and Lena romance was an integral part of the first 2 films, but of course Helen Hunt was on the verge of real stardom and I'm sure her asking price by 1993 (when TRANCERS 4: Jack of Swords was released) could have financed 2 or 3 complete Full Moon productions. Still, I have fond memories of these films, and eagerly looked forward to the Full Moon "Videozone" bonus materials--which, happily, are preserved for these releases. In fact, these DVD's appear to be direct ports of the VHS versions. It's probably the only DVD release these films will ever get, so if you're a fan, you'll want to go ahead and pick this set up. Most others might like to rent the original film first, and see if you want to invest in this somewhat expensive DVD collection.

OK, you can read a couple of hundred reviews here about how the movie was unjustly overlooked, how it lost Disney millions of dollars at the box office, etc. All true. But I just want to comment on how fantastic the film looks on Blu-ray hi-def. John Carter is that rare film which combines an intelligent and entertaining story with state-of-the-art visual effects. Truly, it is a feast for the eyes. If you're among those movie lovers who is still holding out on upgrading to Blu-ray, this is the movie that should convince you.The bonus features are also plentiful--which I found a pleasant surprise, given the lukewarm box-office performance--and really do a lot to enhance one's enjoyment of the film. There's a feature on adapting E.R. Burroughs' original stories to the screen, and John Carter's "journal," which can be viewed simultaneously with the film. There are even some amusing "Barsoom Bloopers" and a featurette on the amazing special effects."John Carter" should have been the Star Wars of a new generation. And by the way, when I say "Star Wars" I'm talking about the original 1977 film. Watching JC in the theater, I really felt the way I did watching George Lucas's original flight of space fantasy way back when. I'm happy to report the movie loses almost none of its splendor on the home screen. But again, Blu-ray is an absolute must to savor every pixel of the fantastic world of Barsoom. Buy it!

As a couple of others have pointed out, the only real problem with Tamales 101 is that the recipes aren't always practical for those of us with limited resources. I was delighted to find a good recipe for traditional pork tamales, but had to really get creative when it came time to mix all the ingredients together.I've always loved tamales, and I really appreciated the author's brief history lesson on this traditional food. My wife and I also enjoyed the simple tomatillo sauce recipe.One thing to remember: PLAN AHEAD. Even relatively simple tamales take lots of preparation and work. Having a helper is almost essential; my wife and I made the above-mentioned recipe together, and it still took 2 days from start to finish.Bottom line: A good book for beginners (like myself) who have always been a bit intimidated by the idea of making tamales from scratch.

OK, you all know the film's a classic. Maybe THE classic fifties sci-fi film. So let's talk about the disc itself. As expected, the transfer is first-rate (never in my wildest dreams would have thought I'd ever see a THX-certified copy of this movie). The 70 minute documentary is chock full of good interviews, though the productions values of the program itself leave a bit to be desired. And an interesting choice for the audio commentary: One well-respected genre director (Nicholas Meyer) interviewing another (Robert Wise). Meyer obviously has a deep respect for this type of film and the era in which it was made, and his questions are as thought-provoking as Wise's responses are insightful. The 1951 newsreel is a nice touch, putting the viewer into the political climate of the year in which DAY was released.No DVD collection should be without this classic (and suprisinglly still-relevant) film. And Fox is to be commended for the deluxe treatment it has given the film.

I admit, I didn't want to like this show. After all, it replaced my favorite CBS sitcom from the previous year, The Class. But I gave it a chance, and I'm really glad I did.The Big Bang Theory tells the story of 4 young geniuses, as they find it will take more than book-smarts to navigate the unchartered waters of relationships in the real world. Into their world of role-playing games and physics in-jokes comes Penny, a beautiful waitress who somewhat reluctlantly becomes the guys' guide to life outside their academic shells.What really sets the show apart from other half-hour comedies is the writing. You'd probably need an advanced degree in math or science to know whether some of the jokes are based on real concepts, but it doesn't matter. Just watching the two leads (flawlessly played by Johhny Galecki and Jim Parsons) try to co-exist with Penny living across the hall is pure comic gold. Jim Parsons (as uber-nerd Sheldon) may be the funniest comic actor on t.v., and it will be a shame if he doesn't nab an Emmy nomination for his work here.If you haven't been watching The Big Bang Theory, give it a try. And if you have seen it, I hope you'll join me in voting for a DVD release of this bright and funny show.

To Catch a Thief, though widely regarded as one of Alfred Hitchcock's minor works, benefits from extensive location shooting in the south of France, and of course, the luminous quality of its two leads. It's a worthwhile romantic thriller with plenty of light moments, and certainly one of the most colorful films of his career.But the real attraction to die-hard Hitchcock fans is a brief but fascinating featurette, narrated by the director's daughter and granddaughter, which (much like the movie itself) shows a lighter side of Hitchcock. Home movies of Hitch playing with his kids, horsing around on sets, etc. provide a unique glimpse into his family life. There is also a very well-done documentary on the film itself, and another short featurette on frequent Hitchcock wardrobe designer Edith Head.No Hitchcock fan should be without this well-done DVD.

Like (I suspect) most people reading this, I have a long history with Star Trek and all its incarnations. But it all began with this show. And I for one am tired of hearing about how "cheesy" it was, or "bad special effects." What? Man, this was groundbreaking stuff in the late 60's, and anyone with a sense of history should realize that.I've pretty much enjoyed all the spinoffs, movies, etc. But you'll never convince me that any of them had the chemistry, the ingenuity or sheer entertainment value of the classic series. Kirk was the all-time thinking man's action hero, an Alpha Male for the 23rd century. And there just hasn't been a more interesting alien character than Mr. Spock, played with intelligence and dignity by Leonard Nimoy. And...well, you know about the cast already.As with the other Trek series DVD collections, there are several well-made featurettes. It's a nice treat (and a bit surprising) to hear a few stories you may not have heard before. I especially enjoyed Leonard Nimoy's comments on his widely misinterpreted autobiography "I Am Not Spock."Maybe it's been awhile since you really sat down and watched Star Trek. Maybe you marvel at how the technology on the show Enterprise seems far in advance of that on Kirk's ship, even though Enterprise is set BEFORE the orginal Trek. Maybe every time you see one of those Priceline commercials you wince at what the Mighty Shatner has been reduced to. In any event, this excellent DVD set comes at a time when I think maybe we all need to be reminded of why Star Trek has endured for nearly 40 years.Casual fan or hardcore "Trekkie" (or "Trekker"), I really think you should get this one.

Well, I had high hopes for this one. The package incorporates a 40-page book on the film's production. It's a great, glossy little collectible that definitely will be enjoyed by long-time fans. There's even a little booklet on the 2010 remake, plus a coupon good for up to $7.50 off admission to the new film. So far, so good, right?But then I popped in the disc. Now, I appreciate that this is a 30-year old film and maybe high definition isn't going to do it any favors. Some of the effects scenes, especially those involving mattes, no longer look good. Let me pause right here and I say I'm a fan of the old-school stop-motion animation, matte paintings, all that stuff. But the increased resolution does show off the deficiences of the some of the those old photographic tricks. I'm also not one of those jaded folks who insist my films--especially my fantasy films--be ultra-realistic. But if you're one of those who can't suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, you will be disappointed.But the larger problem is that no attempt seems to have been made to really restore film elements that haven't aged well. The scenes inside Medusa's cave--agrguably among the film's most memorable moments--are horribly grainy. I mean, I had this movie once upon a time on VHS and I'm quite certain it looked better than this. Likewise, the outdoor nighttime battle with giant scorpions is quite murky. It just seems to me someone was being lazy about throwing this thing together, probably in time to capitalize on the 2010 version (a brief featurette about which autoplays when you put in the disc).And I guess we might not even have Clash of the Titans on Blu-ray if not for the new film. I haven't seen it as of this writing, but I'm already concerned that the whole 5 minutes of the featurette focus on the CGI effects being utilized.My advice, if you are a fan and don't already have this: Get the DVD...it's about half the price of the Blu-ray and you still get the free movie ticket.

I admit, I'm a latecomer to the world of One Step Beyond. I had only heard about the show over the years, and maybe seen a few clips from episodes. So I picked this up on a gamble, taken in by claims of its superior restoration, as well as many fans' positive reviews.I'm happy to say I was not at all disappointed. This is a great, spooky (if at times overly talky) show that deserves its cult following. And although I have not seen the previous budget-priced release people are talking about, I do know that for a 50 year old show, the video and audio are spectacular.As a longtime fan of Twilight Zone, I will say that I think the comparisons between the two shows are not really accurate. The only real similarity is that there is an on-screen narrator. But whereas the Zone covers all realms of fantasy, science fiction and horror, OSB pretty much concentrates on psychic phenomena. And it takes itself very seriously. I love how, at the end of the episodes, the host will often relate what we have just seen to a real-life case (my favorite is the eerie coincidences surrounding a supposedly-fictional book that predicted the Titanic disaster 14 years before it happened).If you're a fan, there's no doubt you must own this. But if you missed out on this show as I did, I encourage you to pick it up.

Just when I think I've seen ALL the sci-fi flicks from the fab fifties, here comes this somewhat forgotten little film. Made at exactly the right time to capitalize on Americans' paranoia of menaces from both outer space and behind the "iron curtain," The Flying Saucer seems hopelessly dated now. Now, that wouldn't be such a problem if the film wasn't so drop-dead boring.The Red Planet Marstook a similar anti-Communist track, but had a literate screenplay and fairly credible performances to support its ham-fisted philosophies.Yes, there is a flying saucer in the film. . .for about 20 seconds. The other 70 or so minutes are a tedious mix of noir-inspired narration (from star/writer/director Mikel Conrad), long (and admittedly beautiful) shots of the Alaskan wilderness, and some hard-to-swallow business with a Russian spy.Even if, like me, you enjoy a good ol' drive-in sci-fi flick, you won't find much to love here. There are still plenty of low-budget delights from this era you can try:Stranger from Venus,Kronos,Spaceways, just to name a few.Recommended ONLY for folks who feel they must have EVERY 50's sci-fi film in their collection. I sort of feel that way, but I have to admit, it's getting hard to find any real gems out there.

Although I grew up watching (reruns of) the George Reeves t.v. series, I was always disappointed that they never included any comic-book villains. Filmation's terrific animated show, despite its flaws, definitely delivered on the comic-book action. AND those wonderful super-villains!Each episode moves at a brisk pace (they're only about 6 minutes apiece), and contains enough colorful action to satifsy die-hard comic book fans. Plots involving alien invaders, giant chimps, etc. may seem "cheesy" to more jaded viewers of today, but the series was very much in-line with what was happening in the Superman comics of the era.Fans of the seventies's "Challenge of the Superfriends" will probably like these, but they may seem pretty dated to folks whose primarily knowledge of the character comes from "Smallville" (I'm not knocking that show...I like it quite a bit, actually). The only real downside to "The New Adventures of Superman" is that the animation is a bit limited. But if you've seen ANY Filmation series, you know about what to expect.I hope Super-fans will support this release so we can see the rest of the Filmation DC Comics shows from the sixites.

CONQUEST OF SPACE was the fourth and final of producer George Pal's space operas of the fifties (preceeded byDestination Moon,When Worlds CollideandThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)). The film reunited Pal with WAR director Byron Haskin. As a lifelong fan of these types of films, I've never understood why CONQUEST is rarely mentioned in the literature or discussions among other fans. Perhaps the film wasn't well received at the time, as radiation-fueled giant insects, etc. were a mainstay of mid-fifties sci-fi. And, in much the vein of DESTINATION MOON, the film is an earnest attempt to depict Mankind's future in space.CONQUEST OF SPACE [Spoilers ahead] deals with the first manned flight to Mars, which is launched from an Earth-orbiting space station simply called "The Wheel." But even as the human race boldly forges ahead into the future, human weaknesses remain. The general in charge of the mission goes a bit nuts, endangering the crew. It seems he has gotten religion, and decides that Man ought not to be leaving Paradise for the blasphemous attempt to explore other worlds. It falls to the general's son, also a member of the crew, to save everyone from his zealous father.The most striking aspect of James O'Hanlon's script (from a book by rocket pioneer Willy Ley and astronomical artist Chesley Bonestell) is how the film's attitude toward religion differs from Pal's previous films. In both WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and WAR OF THE WORLDS, Man's faith in God basically either saves the day, or gives us hope for tomorrow. In CONQUEST, the general's beliefs threaten not only to destroy the crew, but jeopardize the future of space travel. At one point, the general describes their situation thusly: "Our destination is Mars. . .or Hell."The real star of the film, though, is its amazing special effects. I know other people have pointed out the similarities between CONQUEST and Stanley Kubrick's2001 - A Space Odyssey. And whether either ever admitted it publicly, you'll never convince me that Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke didn't see this movie prior to writing 2001. Anyway, the composite shots of the always-spinning Wheel and various ships, spacemen, etc. are first-rate. Also impressive are the bird's eye (uh..."Wheel's eye", I guess) views of rockets being launched from Earth. Many modern viewers seem to have little patience for pre-CGI effects; but I think CONQUEST's space scenes are probably the best of any fifites science fiction film.And while it's true some of the dialogue dates the film, it doesn't completely ruin the experience. The lone Japanese crew member's lengthy justification for volunteering for the mission--in which he apologizes for World War II and offers a ludicrous explanation regarding his countrymen's reduced size--is especially grating in these politically-correct times. And no early space-exploration film would be complete without the obligatory comic-relief character, who, unfortunately, is neither very comic or relieving in any way.Even if you're a fan of 1950's sci-fi, it's possible you may have missed this rarely-seen film. In the final analysis, it doesn't quite measure up to the other three George Pal films mentioned above. But it certainly deserves more notice than it has been given.

I believe one of the reasons the Dark Shadows revival series failed to thrive is that it aired Friday nights on NBC. As far back as the original Star Trek, Friday night has been a death sentence for genre television. I think the show might have had a fighting chance on Fox or as a first-run syndication show.Of course, it didn't last. And that's a shame, because it was an excellent updating of the classic gothic soap opera. Ben Cross was reportedly reluctant to play the vampire, but you'd never know it from watching him in action. His scenes with Willie Loomis (the wonderful Jim Fyfe...whatever happened to that guy?) are among the best writing/acting EVER seen on network t.v. I know one common complaint about the revival is that it rushed through some of the classic plotlines. But I for one was looking forward to getting PAST all the familiar stories and into some fresh material. Alas, it was never to happen.Perhaps Dark Shadows will yet again be ressurected. Until then, this is an all-too-brief but satisfying return to Collinwood.

First off, like many people writing reviews here, I must say I'm a HUGE Prince fan. But I was disappointed with this release. My main complaint is that annoying &quot;narrator&quot; voice between many of the tracks. I'm happy for the man that he is excited about his new faith, and I even support his idea of putting all newfound excitement into his music. But it's just not that terribly interesting. Sure, there are standout moments (like &quot;The Work&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Everlasting Now&quot;--which calls to mind &quot;The Sacrifice of Victor&quot;). But there's more than the normal amount of filler material. Lyrically, it feels like he's coasting on this one. But if a more laid-back, jazzy style suits you, then you might at least find the music pleasing. Prince has made a career out of changing styles with almost every release; and THE RAINBOW CHILDREN certainly continues that trend. Unless you're a die-hard fan (in which case you almost certainly bought the thing already), I recommend you TRY before you BUY.

Fagen's previous solo albums were "concept" albums: each had a definite theme that followed through each of the tracks. MORPH is also something of a concept album, although in a looser way. The title track sets the stage for what could have easily been called "New York City Stories," with various character dealing with their dreams and fears of post-9/11 America.Musically, the album actually sounds more like Steely Dan than Donald Fagen...although this certainly isn't a bad thing. Fagen's trademark keyboards and bass abound throughout, but one immediately notices the prominent role of electric guitars on the disc. There's "real" brass (vs. electronically reproduced instruments) on several tracks, giving songs like "Brite Nightgown" and "The Night Belongs to Mona" extra punch. And my favorite new touch has to be the use of an organ and real piano on a few tracks. The music is uniformly tight, occasionally surprising (as in the trippy marimba flourish leading into the 3rd verse of "Brite Nightgown"), and NEVER dull.As a longtime fan, my ongoing gripe is the brief amount of material covered here. Although MORPH has one more track than each of the previous Fagen albums, it still feels too short. And I love a good jazzy instrumental break, but a few of the tunes go on a little too long. In the final analysis: It's not as good as THE NIGHTFLY (nothing...ever...will be), but it's a slight improvement over KAMIKIRIAD.Finally, a plea to Mr. Fagen himself...please don't make us wait another 13 years for more!

OK, there's plenty of reviews of the film itself here, let's look at the DVD. As with previous discs in the 007 Collection, MGM has offered up more bonus features than most casual viewers will ever need. I was very excited to learn that, for the first time, Pierce Brosnan has recorded a commentary track. While his comments tend to ramble and his delivery is, on the whole, a bit dry, it's nonetheless thrilling to have the man himself offering his observations on the film and the role of James Bond. Somewhat more listenable are the comments by the director and producer. And if that's not enough, there's a "pop-up"-style track that conveys text info while you watch the movie. My only minor complaint after sitting thru all 3 commentaries is that much information is repeated."Inside Die Another Day", the main documentary, was also a bit of a letdown, as it focuses mainly on the technical aspects of production. There are also short featurettes on gadgets, etc., as well as Madonna's delightfully sadistic music video and a making-of segment on the video.If you're a 007 fan, there's no-doubt this is a must-have. But even with 2 discs, I'd have to rate it slightly lower than the fully-loaded single disc presentations of other recent Bonds like Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies.

Despite its well-discussed high points, there is little room for doubt that season 3 is inferior to its predecessors. But for fans of Star Trek, and science fiction television in general, this is still a must-have.For one thing, the supplemental materials outshine even the season 1 & 2 sets. I particularly enjoyed the piece on Star Trek's cultural impact, and the one about the Trek collector designing his own props. And if you don't tear up just a bit watching how frail James Doohan has become, you are (as Kirk might observe) "a Klingon bast**d."Now I have TWO complaints, levelled at Paramount. With the (mostly) fantastic job you guys did on the picture and sound, how could you POSSIBLY have not cleaned up some of the space footage? In many instances, our beloved Enterprise looks terribly grainy, as if shot with an old Super 8 movie camera under low light. With today's technology, there's just no excuse for it. And by the way, seasons 1 and 2 suffer from the same problem.The other thing is: We've probably all seen the infamous Trek "bloopers" reel at conventions and on bootleg tapes. Wouldn't that have made a great extra on the DVD's?Now...how about the last two years of the "five year mission" on DVD? True fans will know that I'm talking about the ANIMATED SERIES. A logical choice, no?

First of all, you know whether or not these are "your" type of movies. They're cheap, short and have Bela Lugosi just as his star was beginning to fade. THE CORPSE VANISHES is a typical Mongram 40's programmer, but Bela's really pretty good in it. The real attraction here is THE DEVIL BAT. An unexpected dose of humor is sprinkled throughout the macabre events. Lugosi is perfect as Dr. Carruthers, fiendlishly plotting deaths with his giant mutated bats. And surely no other film in history has used shaving lotion for such a sinister purpose! Naturally, one wishes for more supplemental materials. But the picture quality (and for the most part, the sound) is up to the usual Roan standard of excellence. There are several other povery row Lugosi films available from Roan (The Invisible Ghost, Bowery at Midnight, etc.) but if you only buy ONE, this is the one to get.

I'm still just in awe of this set. And as someone who bought several of the VHS releases back in the 90's, I'm thrilled to see all the various compilations (Best of Barnabus, Scariest Moments, Music Videos, etc.) that are good for a quick fix of Dark Shadows when you don't have all day. Out of the mind-boggling 131 discs here, 5 are devoted to such bonus materials.As for A/V quality, these are the same exact episode releases previously put out by MPI in 4-disc collections (just re-labeled "the complete series"). As such, they are mostly very good, although you should be aware that several episodes have some bad spots that apparently could not be corrected without editing the material. MPI is up-front about this in the liner notes, telling the viewer exactly which episodes this includes, and the reason for choosing to include them in their entirety, warts and all. The booklet included also gives brief synopses for all the episodes--over 1200 in all!If you're a fan of the show, you really should take the plunge and get this one. Sure, it's a lot of money for a single purchase, but it's still hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying the previously-offered sets. I'm currently managing to watch 2 or 3 episodes a day; at that rate, it will still take me 1 1/2 to 2 years to get thru it all!

Like there aren't already enough bargain-basement video companies out there, along comes "Cheezy Flicks Entertainment." I was already suspicious when they issuedThe Red Planet Mars, a rarely-seen yet quite serious early 50's sci-fi film...not really "cheesy" at all. But I'm a huge fan/collector of sci-fi trailers, so I decided to give this one a try.To say that I was disappointed is putting it mildly. Most of these trailers look like they were dubbed from VHS tapes recorded in the EP mode about 25 years ago. You can actually see the video "noise" signal in some places (if you don't know what that is, imagine a tracking error that you can't correct). The few color ones included are so washed-out, they may as well be in black & white.Really, the only thing to recommend this collection is the fact that there are several rarely-seen trailers included: Barbarella, Fire Maidens from Outer Space, Konga, Phantom from Space, Day of the Triffids are scattered among more familiar clips like War of the Worlds, Them, and It Came From Outer Space (none of which, by the way, a real sci-fi fan would consider "cheesy").If you like this sort of thing, and are forgiving of REALLY questionable quality, you might get a kick out of this disc. But for most viewers, it's probably not worth the money.

Two of the lesser Universal chillers, that nonetheless look great on DVD. As expected, these Double Features don't have much in the way of extras. All we get are the trailers for the two films. She-Wolf of London is a complete misfire, lacking any real suspense and peopled with unsympathetic characters. Werewolf of London comes out slightly more enjoyable, and [SPOILER ALERT!] at least it actually does have a werewolf in it! The first 8 Universal single-movie releases all had entertaing and thorough documentaries, which included some info on all the sequels coming out now. But I wish they would have tried to get commentary tracks from film historians David Skal or Tom Weaver, as they did with Dracula, The Wolfman, The Creature, etc. If you're a Universal collector, there's no question you'll be adding these to your collection. Just don't expect the quality (in features or the films themselves) of the other &quot;Classic Monster&quot; discs.

The first, and best, of Universal's monster combos of the forties. Lon Chaney Jr. isn't usually put on the same level with his contemporaries Karloff and Lugosi...and in most cases, rightfully so. But his tortured portrayal of Larry Talbot throughout five Univesal classic monster films is among the most memorable and affecting in all of horror cinema. I do hope these upcoming Universal double-features don't skimp on the extras. Their first 8 DVD releases of the classic monsters have been first-class all the way! Keep 'em coming!

I'm the first to admit that nostalgia can blind us to the true merits, or lack of, any number of artistic endeavors. This is never more true than when viewing t.v. shows produced in the 70's and 80's. I was nine years old when The Incredible Hulk premiered. And, along with the Six Million Dollar Man, it was just about he coolest thing I'd ever seen. Even then, I knew that the Hulk was just a big strong man in green makeup, But it didn't matter. . .it was a comic book come to life. And what nine year old boy could resist that?It was, then with no small amount of trepidation that I approached my old favorite as a 39-year old man. Would it seem cheesy now? I hoped not, but somehow I figured it would have to. Then I watched the pilot episode, probably for the first time at least 20 years. And you know something? There's not much childish about it. I got hooked all over again on the grown-up problems of this man, David Banner. I'm sure that in 1977, I endured all the drama because the payoff was coming: The Big Green Guy would come out and punish wrong-doers. But I really gained a new adult insight into the show. It's NOT about the Hulk, it's about David Banner.To be fair, none of the episodes in the series' short first season really quite live up to the feature-quality pilot. But there's Bill Bixby, who makes Banner a wholly believable and sympathetic character. Of course, there's plenty of action for the kid in us all. And there's that tear-jerker piano theme that closes out each episode. . .as Banner must leave behind the new friends (or enemies) he's made and keep moving. And for the cynical-minded, yes, there IS some cheesiness to be had (my favorite: as the Hulk wrestles a grizzly bear, green paint rubs off on the animal in several shots).In a world where nothing seems as good as it used to be (or maybe that's just middle age creeping up on me?), The Incredible Hulk still holds up quite well.

If you're never seen a Thunderbean Animation DVD, you're really missing out on something wonderful. Fans of classic animation are compelled to seek out these little almost-forgotten gems produced with great affection and reverance for their subject matter.Attack of the 30's Characters, as the liner notes indicate, is something of a "sampler" collection. No less than 8 separate studios are represented by the 16 shorts included here. In addition to the heavyweights like Warners and Disney, equal time (and equal admiration) is given to lesser-known studios like Van Beuren and Terrytoons. Supplemental materials include a few still photo galleries of promotional material, plus a well-written and very informative booklet.If there's a flaw to this collection, it's not exactly the fault of Thunderbean. In the 6 years (as of this writing) since this disc was released, several of the cartoons that were in the public domain at the time have seen "official" releases. Which means that, as good as most of the prints used here are, even cleaner ones have been offered by WB, Disney, Image and even Thunderbean itself. But this collection does appear to be the only place to find good copies of MGM's rarely-seen (and perfectly delightful) "To Spring," the Betty Boop vehicle "Is My Palm Red?" and the classic early Looney Tunes offering "Lady Play Your Mandolin."It's also worth mentioning that because the cartoons are culled from so many different studios and sources, the print quality does vary a bit. The color cartoons tend to suffer some minor saturation problems, although they are still quite acceptable. Having seen most of the company's other DVD's, I do believe they did they best they could with the material.LikeThe Complete Animated Adventures of Van Beuren's Tom & JerryandThe Golden Age of Cartoons: The Complete Adventures of Cubby Bear, Attack of the 30's Characters should receive a warm reception in the home of any fan of early animated cartoons.

Although I have collected nearly all of Alfred Hitchcock's films on DVD, I put off watching this one for a long time. I suppose it was because of the mixed reviews I'd seen over the years, and the fact that the plot itself did not seem to resemble what I expect a "Hitchcock film" to be. It was, ultimately, my love for Ingrid Bergman, not the director himself, that bid me to give this one a chance.And I'm glad I went into it with that mindset, because it's a little hard to think of Under Capricorn as a film made by the "master of suspense." First off, because there IS no suspense. OK, there's a bit of tension as the (SPOILERS AHEAD) romantic triangle of the film's lead players unfolds. And there are a handful of interesting shots, chiefly the long takes which Hitchcock used a year earlier inRopeand a year later inDial M for Murder. But basically, this is a period melodrama which affords little opportunity for the director to show much flair.Two things save Under Capricorn from being such a labor to watch, though. The first, not suprisingly, is Bergman. The makeup and wardrobe department deserve special mention for her initial appearance, in which one of the most beautiful actresses of all time (a pronouncement with which I'm certain Alfred Hitchcock himself would have agreed) look deathly ill. Hitch's camera always loved Ingrid Bergman, and she gets plenty of closeups here. The other redeeming factor the film has is lush Technicolor cinematography. The print used by Image, while perfectly acceptable, does occasionally suffer some saturation problems. This is also a "bare bones" release, meaning all you get is the film itself with no extras.I think Under Capricorn might be more appreciated by viewers who enjoy these sort of period dramas than by fans of Hitchcock. Still, it's not a bad little movie. And it's certainly recommended for Bergman fans.

Although I'm a huge Universal Monsters fan, I put off getting this one for a long time. I was put off by reports that the opera portions of the film far outweigh the horror aspects. And those assertions were absolutely correct. I WANTED so much to love this movie, but I just can't.The 1925 silent version, while not perfect, at least offered an atmosphere of dread and menace--not to mention Lon Chaney's brilliantly macabre makeup work. And although the phantom's underground lair is skillfully realized in this version, there remains very little horror in the tale. Even the unmasking scene is a major letdown. Claude Rains refused to endure any heavy makeup, for fear of being typecast in horror roles--ironic, since he was a major player in two earlier Universal films, The Invisible Man and The Wolfman. The result is a pale imitation of the same scene in the Chaney film.And speaking of Rains, he's a fine actor. But he's really miscast here. Much like Spencer Tracy in Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, released around the same time, Rains simply does not fit the part. His attempts to persuade Susanna Foster to stay with him are delivered with hardly any inflection at all, and the whole scene feels rushed.On the plus side, Phantom is easily the best-looking of all the classic Universal horror films. The technicolor photography is simply gorgeous, and director Arthur Lubin allows his camera to move often, resulting in some impressive tracking and zoom shots. As with all the first wave of "Classic Monster Collection" discs, there is an excellent documentary which covers all the cinematic Phantoms up through the 1962 version.Bottom line: If you're a Universal Monster fan, it's probably worth having in your collection. But don't expect many chills from this well-intentioned misfire of a movie.

Like others have said, I'm really sick of seeing CGI effects in place of good storytelling. And I happen to love the old-fashioned &quot;creature features,&quot; so this one was a real treat. I think SHE CREATURE is a nice melding of the old and the new. Very refreshing to see a little RESTRAINT (those of you unfamiliar with the word can look it up) applied to a horror film. If you like Hammer films or 50's &quot;B&quot; movies, I'm sure you will enjoy this one.

More than enough has been said about the Dixie Chicks' political views. This is a review of the ALBUM. If you don't like 'em, go buy a Toby Keith CD or something.The pre-release material on TAKING THE LONG WAY suggested the Chicks are moving away from traditional country and into more pop/rock territory. And this seems at least partially true. The lush, provocative lead single "Not Ready to Make Nice" is being played by VH-1 (and, sadly, almost nowhere else). And about half the songs here would fit right in on a Top 40 station.Credit for their new sound doesn't belong soley to the Chicks, however (who, for the first time, wrote or co-wrote all the material here). Veteran producer Rick Rubin has produced some of the most successful popular rock acts of the past 20 years. And Heartbreaks guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench certainly help the folk-rock vibe of the disc. Some of the more rockin' tracks have a Sheryl Crow feel, especially "Voice Inside My Head."Not that the group is opposed to pulling out an old-style barn-burner, "Lubbock Or Leave It." The genius of the track (like "Not Ready To Make Nice") is that it can be interpreted two ways: To those who care to think about such things, it's a not-too-subtle jab at President Bush. But it can also be viewed and enjoyed as female empowerment tale, as lead singer Natalie Maines spits venom at a jilted lover. Less volatile but equally compelling is "So Hard," with lines like "Why is fighting all that we're good at anymore?" and the more telling "Sometimes I don't have the energy to prove everybody wrong."Not surprisingly, two of the disc's best tracks have nothing to do with war. "Silent House" is a melodic, haunting elegy to lost loved one. It's Maines' most compelling dramatic performance since HOME's "Top of the World," to which this song could be seen as a sort of follow-up. My favorite track, "Favorite Year," address the differences between The People We Once Were (young, idealistic) vs. The People We Are Now ("Would you know me now?" Maines ponders).The remaining tracks vary from more standard folk-pop ("Baby Hold On", "Everybody Knows") to the gospel-tinged "I Hope." Even these are listenable, if unremarkable.In fact, with its vital musicianship and mostly well-crafted lyrics, it's hard to find much fault with TAKING THE LONG WAY. Except, perhaps, the overall sound of many of the songs does not vary greatly. All the mid-tempo numbers sound sort of the same. But the standout tracks easily outshine the less-inspired ones, making this one of the more enjoyable releases so far this year.

In an age where garbage like the SAW movies and endless remakes of horror classics (The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, etc.) clutter up theaters, it's nice to be able to revisit the visionary horrors of Dario Argento. Sure, Inferno is slow-paced by today's standards...and it's all the more terrifying for it. Like a master painter, Argento takes time to compose each scene for maximum visual impact. Each time I watch Inferno, I get drawn in again.Like his masterpiece, Suspiria, Inferno isn't terribly well-acted or even conventially plotted. But again, it's about the visual experience, the in-your-face horror. Do your nightmares make sense? More often than not, they don't. And that's what the best of Argento's films do: they approximate living nightmares. Even the music--at times discordant and jarring--adds to the unsettling feeling that Something Is Not Right Here.It's safe to say if you're a fan of those recent movies I listed at the start of this review, you probably won't care much for Inferno. But if you have a little patience and willingness to go along for the ride...you may just have a few nightmares after spending a couple of hours in the world of Dario Argento.

If you're a fan of Doctor Who, or just good science fiction, who's been putting off the upgrade to Blu-ray...here's a most compelling reason to make the switch now. These 4 special episodes shine brightly in the hi-def format. BBC gave us a taste of this with last year's release ofDoctor Who: Planet of the Dead [Blu-ray] (which was the first episode to be filmed in HD) as well as the 3 series of Torchwood. I'm not sure what the British are doing different from the U.S. or other countries, but their hi-definition programs are simply the best I have seen in the format.On the chance that you're not familiar with these special episodes themselves, here's a quick run-down. Please note, this review does contain minor SPOILERS:THE NEXT DOCTOR: The 2008 Christmas special. The Doctor visits Victorian England, where he encounters another man claiming to be the Doctor. I won't spoil the surprise, but there are some nice twists and a standout performance from David Morrisey in the title role. This was the first of the modern Doctor's episodes without a regular companion. It was also the last episode before the switch to hi-definition, but the upconvert used here looks fantastic, so it's really a non-issue as far as I'm concerned.PLANET OF THE DEAD: Aired on Easter, 2009. The Doctor and a woman on the run (The Bionic Woman's Michelle Ryan) are among a busload of passengers who find themselves stranded on a desert planet overrun with terrifying flying creatures. Most folks agree this one's just an average adventure. But, it looks stunning.THE WATERS OF MARS: A great, creepy tale set on mid-21st century Mars. The Doctor has some hard choices to make when he realizes a group of Martian colonists are destined to die on the day he arrives. It's also one of David Tennant's finest hours, as he begins to confront the prophecy regarding his own death that he was told at the end of Planet of the Dead.THE END OF TIME: This two-parter was the end of David Tennant's tenure as the famous Time Lord. While confronting his own mortality, the Doctor also must face the enemy who knows him best. . .and the power of a forgotten race that is using the power of time itself to reshape its own destiny. It's a bit of a mixed bag (particularly part 1), but it's still highly engaging and a fitting resolution to the 10th Doctor's journey.As with the individual season episodes, each special includes an hour-long documentary, Doctor Who Confidential. These are typically well-made and informative shows that die-hard fans will appreciate. Most everyone else will probably watch them once (if at all) and not again.More interesting (to me, anyway) is "Doctor Who at the Proms," an hour-long special. It features the music of the show performed live at the Royal Albert Hall. But this is no mere concert; it features actors in costume as Cybermen, Judoon, etc. that interact with the audience. And it's hosted by Freema Aygemen, with an appearance by Catherine Tate.As I said at the outset, these shows look fantastic on Blu-ray. If you're a fan, this is really a no-brainer. As Doctor Who moves into a new era with a new actor in the role, it's very gratifying to know that BBC is providing fans with the best possible versions of these final adventures with the 10th Doctor.

This is mainly to point out the difference between this classic Bosko Video release, and the cartoons in Warner's 2006Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition (Superman - The Movie/ Superman II/ Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut/ Superman III/ Superman IV - The Quest for Peace/ Superman Returns)box set. Although the WB edition boast that the Fleischer cartoons are from "superior vault elements," there are numerous drop-outs in audio and video. While the box set is still an essential purchase for Superman fans, there is simply no finer home video presentation of these 17 classic cartoons than this release.Bosko Video seems to have a very small catalog of such animated titles. I hope they will release more classic cartoons, such as the Fleischer's landmark early Popeye shorts from the 1930's.

With Warner Bros. taking their time releasing "official", restored versions of Popeye cartoons, it may seem like a chore to navigate the sea of public domain cartoon collections still out there. Happily, VCI has stepped up with this sterling collection of vintage shorts from the 1930's to the 50's. While the Fleischer shorts (Disc One) are available from Warners, disc 2 contains 25 color 'toons from Famous Studios. And although most of them have been previously released, this is the best-looking collection of these cartoons so far.There are also commentaries on selected cartoons from Jerry Beck, and a nice gallery of Popeye movie posters. The DVD case claims there is a booklet of liner notes written by Beck, but my set did not contain it.For anyone with a casual interest in Popeye cartoons, this is an excellent place to start. It represents the two most popular eras of the character, and includes all three Fleischer color "two reelers" that are certainly among the best cartoons of their kind ever produced. Purist will prefer the black & white early 'toons, while children (and some BIG kids) will likely enjoy the later color ones. The price is also right, for those who don't want to spend big bucks on the "official" versions.

It's been a long time coming, but now Star Trek fans can FINALLY complete their collection of 23rd century adventures of the starship Enterprise. I'm pleased that Paramount didn't take the quick & easy route with this series. There were rumors that this would just be a "bare bones" set, with just the episodes and no extras. But Paramount did the right thing, and has given us a collection that will sit proudly beside the original series DVD collections (even the packaging mirrors those earlier releases).Of the bonus features, "Drawing the Final Frontier" is really the only one of note. It's a 24-minute documentary on the making of the animated series. One minor complaint: The creators spend way too much time trying to justify the show as "real" Star Trek. This is an age-old, and (in my opinion) ridiculous argument among Trek fans. Gene Roddenberry was involved with the series. It featured almost all the regular cast. It was written by original series veterans, as well as other noteworthy science fiction writers. How could it NOT be considered "real" Trek?There's a well-intentioned, but brief and poorly designed feature on continuity withing the Trek universe. Trust me, you'll watch it once and probably never again. The same goes for the text-only segment on the show's history. Still, I appreciate that time was taken to create ANY supplemental material for this set.As for the show itself. . .it's a hard lesson of growing up: Nostalgia ain't what it used to be. BUT, looking at the show from an adult standpoint, it's easy to appreciate the quality writing (most of the time) and the fact that care was taken to be true to the original series. The voice work is all fine, with the versatile James Doohan providing several additional character voices. Sadly, the animation is sub-par, even for an early 70's production. This is particularly apparent in the frequent close-up shots of characters, whose faces barely move.Still, if you're a Star Trek fan, there's no question that you have to have the animated series. With a little imagination (which we still had to use back in the seventies and is virtually unknown in the age of CGI), you can imagine you're watching a "lost" fourth season of the original series.

With their 8th studio album, a-ha has come up with something that will both surprise and reassure long-time fans. Three of the first 4 tracks sound like nothing the band has ever done. The sensual urgency of "Celice" and "Don't Do Me Any Favours" is underscored with driving guitars. . .something different indeed for the keyboard-driven pop stars. The title track rocks in a similar vein as well. These changes may be a bit jarring at first for fans, but they are a great opening statement.Things settle down with the lovely "Birthright" and "Holyland", the latter of which has quickly become my favorite track on the album. The a-ha we know and love is back in place throughout the rest of the album, with Morten Harkett in fine vocal form with the heartfelt material. This latter half has much in common with the LIFELINES album, which is not a bad thing at all.ANALOGUE does occasionally bog down in the middle, with the lukewarm "Over the Treetops," and the lenghty "Halfway Through the Tour" and its sleepy final 3 minutes of instrumentation. It's epic length without epic strength.Still, there's much to recommend here, and a-ha fans are sure to enjoy it. If you're new to the band (or just rediscovering them), I'd recommend you first get their 2000 masterpiece, MINOR EARTH MAJOR SKY. But ANALOGUE is a fine addition to their catalogue, and hopefully one that will bring them continued international success.

Another interesting drive-in double feature from MGM's Midnite Movies line. But be warned: Although MGM usually does a fine job of pairing similar films, these two are very different.I was initially most intrigued by INVASION OF THE STAR CREATURES, as I consider myself quite a fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi, and had never even heard of this one. I wasn't prepared for the sheer silliness of the story. The best comparison I can draw would be the equally goofy (but much more entertaining) Jerry Lewis sci-fi/comedy VISIT TO A SMALL PLANET. A pair of Abbott & Costello-types get mixed up with some scantily-clad space babes. Plot? I guess there's one in there somewhere, but don't strain too hard. It's a mildly diverting, cheap little comedy that I'm in no hurry to watch again.INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS, although similar in title, is actually a bit of 70's drive-in exploitation trash. The title characters seduce poor Earth-men and kill them, while recruiting busty Earth-women into their ranks. The sex is strictly softcore stuff, but it's still an odd pairing with such an innocuous piece of fluff like STAR CREATURES.Honestly, folks, neither of these films is that great. But I give MGM 3 stars for a first-rate presentation of some fairly obscure films that any serious drive-in afficiando will want in their collection.

I'll be brief, so as to avoid re-hashing previous comments about this release. It's the Planet of the Apes films in hi-definition, folks. If you even just LIKE the movies, this is the only way to go. And for a fan, well, you get the beautifully-made hardback book (which unfortunately mostly just repeats the highlights of the excellent 1998 documentary "Behind the Planet of the Apes," also included here), and a wealth of bonus features. Fittingly, the first film gets the most behind-the-scenes stuff, but there are some well-done featurettes on the others.The other reason to pick it up is to get the controversial unrated cut of "Conquest," available for the first time on home video. The fourth film in the series was already pretty dark; the addition of some surprising blood and gore, plus a shocking new ending, really makes this one stand out. As a longtime fan, I'm not sure I actually PREFER the new cut, but I imagine most hardcore fans will find it to be an improvement.If you have a decent home-theater setup, you'll really get your money's worth out of this one. Video as is good as can be expected (not surprisingly, the bright outdoor scenes in the first 2 films really shine), and the new audio mix brings out the great music of Jerry Goldsmith (among others).Bottom line: Just buy it already! And if you're a fan but have been holding out on upgrading to Blu-ray, now is a great time to do it.

I admit, I wasn't overwhelmed with ANGEL at first. In fact, I remember getting a little bored during the initial half-dozen or so episodes. Oh, I made a point to tune for the &quot;Big&quot; ones: the ones with Buffy, Spike, Faith. In other words, I guess I wanted ANGEL to be very similar to its parent series.But looking at the entire season on these DVD's has urged me to reconsider my feelings about season one (for the record, I have really liked the subsequent seasons). Season one of ANGEL is reminiscent of THE X-FILES, in that it's basically an anthology show with a few recurring characters. And there were several standout episodes. And no disrespect intended to the late Glenn Quinn, but I do feel the show took off after he departed and Wesley (Alexis Denisof, the show's best actor) joined the team.Now...Fox just has to do better with the extra features. Each season of BUFFY on DVD has added more bonus material to the package. There's a decent overview of season one, and a couple of brief featurettes here, but that's it.If you were initially underwhelmed with this BUFFY spinoff, I suggest you give it another look.

Like another reviewer mentioned, I grew up reading and hearing about this movie for many years. When the films of the great William Castle started finding their way to home video in the early 80's, Macabre was MIA. I thoroughly enjoyed 13 Ghosts, House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler, to name some of the more popular titles. But in my mind's eye, I could still see that wonderfully spooky movie poster (see the DVD cover), and wondered if I'd ever get a chance to see Macabre.So was the wait worth it? Well, for the most part, yes. Remember, this is Castle at the beginning of his directing career. Although he'd already started using gimmicks to lure patrons in the theater, he hadn't quite perfected the horror film. Which just means that, although Macabre is very well-made, the pace may be too slow for modern viewers.Warner Bros. should be commended for taking time to do a proper restoration, something they still seem reluctant to do with many films in their "Made on Demand" library. If you like black & white horror and suspense films, the restored print used here is terrific. The audio track is mono, but it's clear and uniform throughout the film. And this is becoming a common complaint with these MOD releases, but there are NO extra features. . .not even chapter stops (although the viewer can skip ahead in 10 minute increments by simply pressing the chapter skip button on the remote). It's a shame, too, because the film's original trailer is wonderful. A disclaimer on the package states that the film, made on a DVD-R disc, may not play back on computer drives or DVD recorders. I don't know about the recorder option, but I've got a Blu-ray player and 52" screen, so I can't imagine ever playing a movie on my PC.If you have fond memories of the film, or just a long-held curiosity like I did, this one's worth picking up. The MOD program definitely needs some tweaking, but in the meantime it may be the only way to enjoy seemingly lost films like this one.

Here's one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original on almost every level. True, the first FF film didn't set the bar too high, but I felt the lighthearted approach worked pretty well.In an age of "dark" heroes, it's refreshing to see a comic-book based franchise that doesn't take itself too seriously. Rise of the Silver Surfer won't ever win awards for writing, acting, or even special effects(ooh...liquid metal, never seen THAT before), but the characters are a lot of fun. Even the seemingly unnecessary return of Julian McMahon's Victor Von Doom doesn't slow this one down. All the characters get their moments in the spotlight, but Chris Evans' Human Torch benefits the most. The story allows him to balance his comic-relief moments with some weighty dramatic touches.With a running time of just an hour and a half, SURFER gets the job done without wearing out its welcome. . .something missing from more successful but flawed and bloated superhero films like Spider-man 3 and Superman Returns.Finally, as someone who has succumbed to the temptation to buy more than one DVD version of the first FF, as well as Spider-man 2, I'm glad Fox decided to offer the 2-disc deluxe treatment for SURFER up front.Rise of the Silver Surfer isn't a classic by any means, but it's a refreshing alternative to the increasing number of sub-par hero films out there.

The first thing you may notice about this set is that it has more bonus features than the previous DVD sets. In addition to the obligatory (and always well-done) season overview, there are outtakes, karaoke music videos (!) and plenty of supplemental material on the musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling.&quot; And even a somewhat amateurish but still very interesting panel discussion with several cast members and production personnel.As for the show itself, season 6 has been maligned for being too dark, and its main villains not worthy successors to the &quot;Big Bad&quot;'s of the past. I don't think either of these are fair criticisms. After the events of season five, culminating in Buffy's death, there had to be a long road back to getting things the way they were. Buffy made some very HUMAN mistakes along the way, as did some of the other characters. Yeah, it was depressing in places...but that's life.As for the villains, I think the writers figured it was time to lighten up, especially considering the events mentioned above. And for fans of horror/sci-fi/fantasy, etc., the &quot;Trio&quot; were a delight, with their nonstop, often obscure pop culture references. And of course, it wasn't the boys who turned out to be the REAL Big Bad of season six. Alyson Hannigan was consistently amazing throughout the season.And this probably could go without saying, but &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; has got to be one of the top ten hours of television ever produced.Buy it already!

Yeah, the DVD isn't top-drawer, to be sure. But let's not forget the focus of this whole thing: the &quot;lost&quot; t.v. pilot TALES OF FRANKENSTEIN. The video quality is good, the sound is O.K. Personally, I enjoyed getting to see the show after reading about it for years. It would have made an interesting anthology-type series. The trailers are fun, but not from the best sources in many cases. For die-hard Hammer fans or Frankenstein enthusiasts, the disc's deficits are acceptable.

It just sounds like a bad idea. Anyone remember "Scooby Doo Meets Batman"? That was my attitude going in. But I admit, I was wrong! The Batman vs. Dracula is a first-rate animated adventure, and stays remarkably true to the character as envisioned in the somewhat underrated "The Batman" series.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but let's just say that the legendary count considers Batman as something of a kindred spirit. I initially thought it seemed unnecessary to include the Joker and Penguin. But their presence serves the story well, and makes for some fun AND creepy moments. In fact, for a "kid's movie," this gets pretty intense.I know one criticism of the new series is that it tends to emphasize action over character development. But when you see the superbly-paced first battle between Batman and Dracula, you'll be so caught up in the action that you may not have time to think about anything else.All in all, a terrific effort. I hope to see more feature-length adventures of THE Batman.

Fans of Christopher Lee and/or Hammer Films, don't wait on this one. Get the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; and you'll be treated to a superb bonus disc, that includes an hour-long documentary hosted by the man himself, plus two MUSIC VIDEOS featuring Mr. Lee singing! A rare treat which makes the DVD worth buying. As for SCARS OF DRACULA, it's neither the best nor worst in the series. Widely reputed as the most violent Hammer Dracula, the film has not been viewed favorably (detractors include Lee himself---check him out on the commentary track!). But if you can avoid comparing the film to the studio's earlier, superior films (particularly those helmed by Terence Fisher), you might just find a decent horror movie waiting to be discovered. As expected from the nice folks at Anchor Bay, the picture and sound quality are top-notch, surpassing DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS (in my opinion). But the extras really overshadow the beautifully-transferred, but flawed film. Sink your teeth into this one, horror fans!

Let's get one thing out of the way: I love the Wolf Man! He was always my favorite classic Universal monster, largely due to Lon Chaney Jr.'s sympathetic portrayal of the monster's human form, Larry Talbot. When I first heard the title "House of the Wolf Man," I was positively giddy with anticipation.Then I watched the movie.(Minor Spoilers ahead)A group of five seemingly disparate strangers accept the invitation to spend the night at the castle of one Dr. Reinhardt (Ron Chaney, the grandson of Lon Jr.). Cue the cliches: Stormy night, disfigured assistant, things that go bump in night, etc. And to their credit, the filmmakers do mangage to more or less successfully copy the look of a 1940's-era Universal horror film. The appearance of Reinhardt's quadraplegic grandmother serves to offer some legitmate connections (ludicrous though they may seem) to the "real" Wolf Man films. You see, she's the brother of the Bela character from the original film (Bela Lugosi gets a cameo in a portrait hanging on the wall). And Reinhardt's own lineage is, well. . .I won't give it all away.House of the Wolf Man, with all its good intentions, has two major flaws. The script doesn't really go anywhere. Almost NOTHING happens in the first half hour. And as others have pointed out, the monsters don't show up until the final 10 minutes (more on that in a minute). But what almost sinks the film from the beginning is the horrible acting. Sadly, the one person from whom we might reasonably expect a decent performance (Chaney) proves the worst of the bunch. And this isn't bad acting on purpose, as seen in parodies likeThe Lost Skeleton of Cadavra. It's just. . .well, it's bad.If there's a saving grace here, it's that the monsters DO deliver when they finally appear. For anyone who was disppointed with the 30 second melee between the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster inFrankenstein Meets the Wolfman [VHS], there's some real action to be found here. A last-minute inexplicable appearance by Dracula adds to the feel that we are, for a brief shining moment, back in that world that we classic monsters fans hold so dear. This thought is really brought home in the abrupt ending, a flaw shared by many of the later Universal films. Oh, and bonus points for blink-and-you'll-miss-it homages to Creature from the Black Lagoon and Dr. Pretorious's creations from Bride of Frankenstein.Like I said, I'm a fan. And believe me, 3 stars is VERY generous for this film. If you love the old monster movies, it is worth a look. But you'll have to be very forgiving of its flaws if you are to find any enjoyment here. I actually hope the disc sells well, as its success could pave the way for other such projects. Let's just hope the filmmakers invest more time and money on hiring some better talent.

There are so many El Cheapo public domain cartoon compilations out there, I'm always delighted when an old favorite gets some respect from a reputable company. And Classic Media does not disappoint with this rather random but still very attractive set of 1960's Casper shorts.Here's the list of cartoons:ENCHANTED HORSEGROWING UPMOTHER GOOSE LANDTWIN TROUBLEWENDY'S WISHWHICH IS WITCHICE SCREAMCASPER GENIETRUE BOOBOOS AND SADDLESBOOS AND ARROWSLITTLE LOST GHOSTI rate these very high because, for one thing, Casper was almost never shown where I lived growing up. So it's really like watching all new cartoons for me. I'm sure the nostalgia factor will be high for those who DID watch these on t.v. years ago. In any event, the picture and sound quality are quite good, if not quite as polished as the major-studio releases for the Looney Tunes or Tom & Jerry collections.If you're buying this for children, rest assured that they are VERY G-rated, and blissfully lack the irony or sardonic wit that has saturated nearly all of kids' programming since the early 1990's. The title of this collection is "Scare Up Some Fun," and that's exactly what it does offer: Slightly spooky-themed laughs with colorful and likable characters. And for some of us, that's enough.

Another must-have Disney special edition...there are enough bonus features here to keep you busy for days. I really liked the "virtual safari", where Timon & Pumba guide you thru the jungle by jeep or boat. You also get an insider's look at the making of a modern animated classic. The whole package is just very classy, with all-new animated menus and interactive features.There's also a newly-added scene incorporated into the film, a new musical number called "The Morning Report." While this is an enjoyable addition, it doesn't really add anything new to the film.As expected, the picture and sound quality are exceptional; you'll really get swept up into the picture during the more action-filled moments.You simply must own this beloved Disney film, an this 2-disc set is likely to be a highlight of your home video collection.

Like all the reviewers here, I've been a fan of the fantasy film work of Ray Harryhausen since I was a kid. Fantastic journeys with Sinbad, Jason, and others are among my fondest childhood movie memories. But true science fiction was always my first love. So that's why I'm so excited that, among the many great films Harryhausen worked on, EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS has finally made its way to Blu-ray.While it never makes the Top 10 list of 50's sci-fi flicks, I think it belongs there, alongside the originalThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition),Forbidden Planet [Blu-ray], andThis Island Earth. There were other alien invasion films during the decade, but none deliver the goods like Earth vs. The Flying Saucers. And it's not just because of the master animator's incredible effects work. The story, though certainly dated, holds up well for what it is. A jaded viewer will spot the cliches: Studly scientist (Hugh Marlowe) in love with the General's daugher (Joan Taylor), a military that is actually competent and helpful, and so on. But to my mind, these are things to cherish about the film rather than being deficits.To be fair to the whole box set, ALL the movies here are great in their own way. THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is certainly the best of Harryhausen's trilogy of film featuring the adventure-loving sailor. 20 MILLION MILES TO EARTH features one of his earliest beloved creatures, the Ymir, and uses Italian scenery to great effect (in an interview included on the disc, Harryhausen admits he chiefly accepted the job to get a free trip to Rome!). IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is probably the least-known film, but holds its own against the onslaught of giant-creature flicks of the time.OK, if you're a fan, you may know all of this already. So what about the Blu-ray discs, you say? I own all the films on DVD (including TWO previous releases of Earth vs. The Flying Saucers...hey, I told you upfront I love that movie!), including the Legend Films colorized versions of Earth and 20 Million Miles. And I can tell you that the improved resolution is noticeable but may NOT be enough for casual fans to upgrade. As someone else noted, these films are pretty old. And there's only so much you can do with them. If by chance you don't have the DVD's, then certainly you should go straight for the Blu-ray's. Note that each film has a wealth of supplemental materials, but these are all holdovers from the most recent DVD releases. So the only real reason to upgrade is if you already know you love these movies, and want to see them in the highest possible resolution.Like I said, I'm a fan. So it was worth it to me. I've been watching these movies for almost 40 years, from staying up to watch "All Nite Movies" on a local channel, to currently enjoying them in true 1080p definition on a 52" HDTV. It's truly a movie-lovers dream come true. Now, we just need the rest of the Harryhausen catalog released.

I had such high hopes for this one. I consider the first Hunchback of Notre Dame to be THE greatest modern Disney movie, period. It looks fantastic, has memorable music and a grand theatricality that leaves other so-called "children's films" in the dust. But direct-to-video sequels are notorious substandard, and I put off buying this one for several years. But then I thought, "OK, if they managed to get the original voice cast back, MAYBE there's something to this."But the sad truth is, everything I loved about the first film is missing. The main problem, as many have stated, is that the animation is just plain terrible. It looks cheap, like most made-for-television animation (I know there are exceptions, but they are few and far between). The story is cliched, even for Disney. And even with the impressive vocal talents of Tom Hulce, Jason Alexander, etc., it doesn't really matter if the character aren't given anything interesting to do. I will grant that the music isn't all that bad, which is why I'm giving this a generous 2 stars.Maybe very young children will like it. Or parents who feel the first film is too intense for the very young (and I would agree with them...the first Hunchback should have been given a PG rating). But for any adults who enjoyed the original, this one's a major letdown.

Great concert video all-around, but I would have preferred to see one complete concert without all the editing of footage from several. It's also refreshing to see the band focusing on the music, and barely even addressing the controversy that has seemingly engulfed them this past year.The &quot;Top of the World&quot; video included here is a nice bonus, a surprisingly effective cautionary tale that you may to watch more than once to fully grasp.Certainly this is a must-have for fans. And at the price, it's the best 10 bucks you're likely to spend all year.

Although I consider myself a huge fan of classic movies, I only recently became aware of this film while reading Dwayne Hickman's autobiography. In fact, it was the presence of Hickman and his "Dobie Gillis" co-star Tuesday Weld, plus the fact that the story was written by Dobie creator Max Shulman, that led me to give this one a try. Of course, seeing Paul Newman and Joan Collins in their prime isn't a bad thing, either."Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys" is somewhat atypical for a farce comedy of the fifties. This was 1958, and attitudes and censorship about overt sexuality on the screen were become more relaxed. Just take a look at the film's poster, reproduced for the DVD cover. The film not only gives us Joan Collins in a bathtub, but in various states of undress throughout the film. And then there's Tuesday Weld's teenage character announcing to her exasperated dad, "Guess what? I've discovered boys!" Although certainly tame by today's standards, this is probably among the first "sex comedies."And although I did enjoy the film, I do feel there are two drawbacks: First of all, considering it came from the pen of Max Shulman, it could have been funnier. Oh sure, there are a handful of great comic scenes, and the cast is generally capable of delivering the few laughs they are given to hand out. Second, as I said upfront, it was Dwayne Hickman who brought me here. And sadly, he is really miscast as the motorcyle-riding love interest for Ms Weld. I'm not sure what kind of accent he was going for, but it just doesn't work.The DVD, however, is first-rate. The picture is HD-quality, with vivid colors and sharpness rarely seen on films of this vintage. I haven't played the audio commentary track yet, so I can't comment on that. But if you have any interest in the film at all, you won't be disappointed with the presentation.

It's about time Universal got around to releasing a decent disc of Psycho 3. The film, directed by star Anthony Perkins and released theatrically in 1986, has widely been regarded as a marked decline in quality for the Psycho series. And I admit, I once regarded it the same way. Unlike the relatively tame Psycho 2, the third film in the series ups the sex & violence level considerably. This was probably a conscious attempt to compete with films of its time...remember, "splatter" films were big in the mid-80's.But, like Hithcock's original masterpiece, there's more going on here than meets the eye. Perkins the Director appears to have studied not only Hitchcock (the opening scene is straight out of VERTIGO), but other contemporary filmmakers like John Carpenter and Dario Argento. Psycho 3 is almost equal parts fright film and black comedy...a combination that certainly describes many of Hitchcock's most successful films.Though hardly a perfect film, Psycho 3 is a worthy successor to its predecessors and a delighfuly twisted horror film in its own right. Give it another look, and I hope you'll agree.

Although the 1953 WAR OF THE WORLDS was previously available on DVD, this new version renders that bare-bones release irrelevant. Here's the original and still-unsurpassed George Pal version of H.G. Wells' novel, beautifully restored and overflowing with extras. If Steven Speilberg's impressive but flawed 2005 version served any purpose, I hope that is it to get folks interested in seeing this classic film.Now, about those extras: Not one but TWO commentary tracks are included. The first is by the film's stars, Ann Robinson and Gene Barry (who were shamefully reduced to non-speaking cameos in the 2005 film). Robinson has become the unoffical torch-bearer for the film, appearing at conventions and talking extensively about the film in interviews over the years. She even had a recurring role in the 1988 t.v. series. She and Barry both have fond memories to share, and fans are blessed to have them both still in good health and able to share their insights. Even more insightful, from a technical standpoint at least, is the second commentary. Filmmaker Joe Dante, historian Bob Burns and author Bill Warren share many behind-the-scenes tidbits in a breezy and very listenable audio track.Then there's a well-done documentary on the film, the great theatrical trailer, and. . .best of all. . .the original Orson Wells Halloween-night radio broadcast of WAR OF THE WORLDS from 1938.All this for about 10 bucks?! Even if you have never seen the film, or haven't seen it in years, it's a small price to pay for one the true classics of the cinema. It's certainly the best film of its kind to come out of the fifties. And one of THE best, period. You must buy this DVD!

This might be a minority opinion, but I think an extended cut of Fantastic Four is a fine idea. I bought the movie, without having seen in in the theater (bad word-of-mouth, you know), and I enjoyed it. But it wasn't anywhere near as good as other Marvel superhero films like the Spider-man or X-Men series.So what do you get with this new vesion? Twenty extra minutes of footage edited back into the film. And it's mostly minor stuff, but most of the scenes do help develop the characters further. [Spoilers Ahead] An extended scene between Susan Storm and Victor Von Doom is among the best, as it helps to further define Victor's feelings of jealousy toward Reed Richards. And for longtime fans, there's a subtle cameo from the FIFTH member of the Fantastic Four (from the somewhat lamentable 80's cartoon series). And if you haven't already heard about the Wolverine gag...well, that one could have stayed on the cutting room floor.And for everyone complaining about buying another version of a film they already own, you'll be happy to know that the studio is getting it right the first time withGhost Rider - Extended Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition).

What really gets me about Fiend without a Face is the sound. The sound of the titular fiends sucking out the brains and spinal cords of their victims is delightfully disgusting. The picture quality is not quite up to the standard of The Blob, but you know Criterion did the best they could. Someone else mentioned The Haunting. I'd like to add to my Criterion Wish List another seminal, overlooked, and long out-of-print on VHS classic, I Married a Monster from Outer Space.

Some shows thrive not on the quality of their writing or production values, but on the strength of likable, dependable personalities in front of the camera. Melissa & Joey is such a show. Sure, WHO'S THE BOSS? already tackled the "manny" premise (although it was called "housekeeper" in the 80's), and mismatched couples have been the bread & butter of sitcoms since at least the 1960's. But by casting two beloved t.v. stars (no coincidence, either, since Hart and Lawrence do double duty as executive producers), the show manages to rather easily hook viewers.Truth be told, I found the first 3 or so episodes to be very average. But things start to pick up as the chemistry builds between the leads, and the relatively small supporting cast starts to find their own voices. Melissa Joan Hart has been a gifted comic actress since her pre-teen Nickelodeon years, and it's to her credit than the somewhat edgy Mel Burke remains a thoroughly likable character. Joey Lawrence, himself a 30+ year t.v. veteran, is solid as well, with a slightly more believable character with which to work.One word of caution: Don't be fooled by the "ABC Family" logo. Melissa & Joey, while never really wallowing in gutter humor, can aim low with the best (or worst?) of them at times. Still, for appropriate ages, it's as good as anything on network television at the moment. Whether you consider that a compliment or not probably depends on how much t.v. you watch. My wife and I watch quite a bit, and even though the show IS very familiar at times, it's still entertaining and fun to watch. And really, does a sitcom need to do more than that?

Just when I thought I'd seen pretty much every science fiction film from the fab fifties, along comes this pair of forgotten gems from 1956. And while I'm not quite prepared to call either of them "lost classics," I was impressed with the production values and overall serious tone of both films.WORLD WITHOUT END takes more than a few threads of H.G. Wells' TIME MACHINE, as a group of astronauts finds themselves stranded in a dystopic future earth of the year 2509. Humanity is divided into two classes: men (who are impotent) and women who live beneath the surface, and the savage "beasts" who resemble neanderthals. Genre favorites Hugh Marlowe and Rod Taylor are among the spacemen who try to spur the passive humans into action against their oppressors. And in typical 50's fashion, there are some fetching females for the lonely travelers to admire.SATELLITE IN THE SKY offers up a serious attempt to depict a flight into outer space, similar in some respects to George Pal'sConquest of Space, release a year earlier. A rocketship blasts off (in a scene virtually lifted from Pal'sWhen Worlds Collide) carrying a "tritonium" bomb. Lois Maxwell--Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond film from 1962 to 1985--is a reporter covering the story. While the film's anti-war message is predicably heavy-handed, particularly in the downbeat ending, the first-rate special effects keep this one interesting.Both films in this Warner Bros. double-feature are presented in their original Cinemascope aspect ratio. Although there are no extra features at all (not even chapter selections?!), I do have to commend WB for making these relatively minor films look fantastic. SATELLITE in particular practically jumps off the screen. Some early scenes with jets, which do not appear to be the standard stock footage used in so many films, are breathtaking. . .no minor feat for a 50+ year old "b" sci-fi movie.If you're into these sorts of films, you'll definitely want to add this disc to your collection.

As a longtime fan of Hammer Films, I'm delighted that these two films from their later period are finally being made available. Although most folks seem to be focusing on DINOSAURS, I was actually more excited about MOON.MOON ZERO TWO is real oddity. It was released a year after2001 - A Space Odyssey, and is among the few films of the period to take a relatively serious approach to its subject matter. Having said that, there are several aspects of the film which hopelessly date it. For starters, the hideous psychadelic theme song sets the wrong tone. Imagine a lost episode of "Schoolhouse Rock," in which animated American and Russian astronauts compete to the beat of a psychadelic tune. From there, we are treated to other strictly-60's images, including women whose sole purpose is sex appeal (which is limited due to the horrible pastel wigs), astronauts in jumpsuits that make the pansy uniforms of SPACE: 1999 look like high fashion, and some very dull drama. On the plus side, the special effects are an agreeable cross between Douglas Trumball's groundbreaking work on 2001 and the less-impressive but still very-detailed work of the various Gerry Anderson series. In short, it's hardly a classic. But it's an interesting curio of its time, and a well-intentioned attempt at real science fiction.WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH is the follow-up to Hammer's highly-succesfulOne Million Years B.C.. Both are pre-history tales of fantastic creatures and women in skimpy bikinis. And while the absence of Ray Harryhausen (who provided the excellent dinos and such for the previous film) would seem a hindrance, his protege Jim Danforth does a credible job of bringing the various critters to stop-motion life. There is a plot, of sorts, as newcomer Victoria Vetri is blamed for the appearance of the moon in the sky. And she befriends one of the smaller dinos, and sheds her tiny fur duds for caveman Patrick Allen (yes, this is the uncut British version with brief nudity).As with its companion Warners double-featureWorld Without End/Satellite in the Sky, there are no extras included. Still, the prints used look fantastic, and it's a small miracle to have either of these films on DVD in ANY condition.While neither film is a real classic, Hammer fans will appreciate having them in their collections. And for folks who don't mind the less-demanding thrills of these types of movies, you could do a lot worse.

Back in the early-to-mid 80's, NBC OWNED Thursday nights with a killer sitcom lineup: The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers and Night Court. And while history will probably ultimately judge Night Court as the least acclaimed of the four, I think it's still the funniest. And you can see the other 3 on TV Land or Nick At Nite...I don't remember the last time I saw Night Court in syndication.And it's true, the first season was a little rough (hence 4 stars instead of 5). But the brilliant John Larroquette is reason enough for me to own all seasons of this show. I hope someday his own John Larroquette Show will get a DVD release.I hope fans will scoop this first season up, so we can get on with the later (and better) seasons.

PLEASE NOTE: This review contains SPOILERS.I've been a fan of How I Met Your Mother from Day One, so I don't use a phrase like "starting to slip a little" lightly. But the fact is, season three just doesn't quite measure up to the previous two.The main problem, as I see it, is that the writers felt the need to create ongoing conflict between the core group of friends. Sure, conflict is necessary to keep things interesting. But I think the ensemble in this show is better served by external conflicts (e.g., Barney and Ted's various problems with the opposite sex, Marshall's work-related stress, etc.). Watching Ted and Robin try to one-up each other after a painful breakup last season was. . .well, not that funny. Later in the season, Ted and Barney's friendship was on the rocks.Otherwise, there were plenty of well-written and funny shows. Here's a few highlights:"Slapsgiving" pays off the long-running joke from last season's "Slap Bet.""We're Not From Here" allows Barney and Ted to cut loose, posing as out-of-towners."How I Met Everyone Else" introduces us to a classic Barney Stinson gimmick: The Crazy/Hot Scale."Ten Sessions" introduces Ted's major love interest Stella (Sarah Chalke), probably his most memorable girlfriend since season one's Victoria. His manic (and successful) attempt at a two-minute date is probably the high point of the season."Sandcastles in the Sand" brings back Robin Sparkles. . .and culminates in an ending so shocking, you'll be grateful you don't have to wait another week to see what comes next.I guess it's fair to say the good outweighs the not-so-good in season three. At its heart, How I Met Your Mother is the longest tease in television history (yet a few tantalizing clues as to the identity of "mother" are dropped this year). I hope they can keep it fresh awhile longer, even though the inherent illogic of its premise (just how long have Ted's kids been sitting on that couch listening to Bob Saget?) may soon start weighing heavily even on fans like myself.

After waiting ten years for a Red Dwarf reunion, hearing rumours of another series or even a big-screen movie, fans' anticipation level for "Back to Earth" was VERY high. I'm sure I'm not the only fan who, after viewing this 3-part episode, was left wondering if the wait was worth it.(SPOILERS AHEAD)While it is nice to have most of the cast back (including a too-late and too-brief turn by Chloe Annett), the magic that made Red Dwarf such fun is laregly missing. It starts off promisingly enough, with Lister making Rimmer the butt of another in a series of practical jokes. But when the main plot kicks in, a sinking feeling of deja vu sets in. "Back to Earth" appropriates the plot from an earlier, better episode, "Back to Reality." I won't give it all away, but if you've seen the earlier episode, the "twist" ending of this one won't come as a shock at all.The other, only slightly lesser problem is that very little attempt is made to maintain the series' continuity. It's been ten years (nine, according to an on-screen message) since the crew was left hanging at the end of "Only the Good. . .". When "Back to Earth" begins, Rimmer is inexplicably a hologram again, Kochanski has been written out of the show, and the ship is back in deep space with the 4 lead players in place like nothing has changed.So, you're thinking, this guy's given it 3 stars...is there ANYTHING good about it? Well, yes. For starters, everyone looks like they've barely aged, which is just short of miraculous considering the first episode of Red Dwarf aired 21 years ago. And even though the script gives them little of note to work with, the actors slip back into their roles with ease. Production values are generally high, although a CGI skutter in place of the old animatronic one will make long-time fans cringe.As a long-time fan, I'd certainly be thrilled if this led to a revival of the series. I just hope the writers can come up with some fresh and FUNNY ideas, or they should let Red Dwarf rest in peace.

I was nine years old when Star Wars came out in 1977. I got the action figures, saw the movies dozens of times, all that stuff. I'm definitely a STAR WARS KID.But the truth is, this Robot Chicken episode just isn't all that funny. I got way more enjoyment out ofFamily Guy - Blue Harvest, because it was a straight-up parody, not this disjointed rapid-fire collection of random sketches. I've always found Robot Chicken to be hit-and-miss, but I expected more from this highly-touted episode.Now, if you find yourself among the folks who DID like it, you'll be thrilled by all the extras. Personally, I don't think this very average piece of work warrants so many bonus features.

I consider myself quite the classic horror fan, so I'm surprised this one has flown under my radar for so long. I'm glad I took a chance and picked it up, because it's quite a gem. Several other reviews have given details of the film's production, edits and release problems. I'd like to just focus on the movie itself, and the DVD.I've always thought the best horror films were the low-budget ones that had to get by on atmosphere and sheer moviemaking invention. Films likeVampyr - Criterion Collection,Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition), and evenThe Blair Witch Projectwork not because they have big budgets or stars' names above the credits. They have the feel of a nightmare, one in which the viewer feels trapped and unable to overcome. Such a film is The Flesh Eaters. Even though you know on some level you are just watching a movie, the film draws you in and makes you feel you are there, living the nightmare.And what a nightmare it is. Some have called it the first gore film. I'm not sure if that's true, but some scenes still pack a punch. And the deceptively simple depiction of the title creatures (which appear to be holes punched in the film to let light bleed through) is surprisingly believable. Even if the film's gore doesn't really hold up to the more realistic stuff that would be done 10 or 20 years from the time of its release, it's still fairly disturbing in the context of that time, when the results of violence were usually shown after the fact.Having not seen the film before now, I can't compare the A/V quality with previous releases. But I do know that it looks and sounds great for a nearly 50 year old low-budget horror film. I played the disc on my Blu-ray player on a 32" HDTV, and it certainly compares favorably to any of the higher-profile releases from the same time.And be sure not to miss the deleted "Nazi Experiments" scene or the outtakes, which would get the film an "R" rating even now. There are also a pair of theatrical trailers that probably scared many a moviegoer back in the 60's.If I have any minor complaints about this release, it's that it did leave me wanting more. I mean, in the way of behind-the-scenes information. There's an insert in which writer/producer Arnold Drake marvels at the film's reputation, but that's it. Still, the film is not to be missed, and I am now inclined to find out more about it.

First off, let me apologize because this isn't a proper review. But I didn't see any other way to pose these questions. The editorial review above states there are 8 films in this collection, including at least one featuring Boris Karloff. But there are only SIX movies listed on the cover, and Karloff isn't in any of them. This page needs to be revised to reflect an accurate list of what's in this set.For the record, my 3-star rating isn't just arbitrary. I have seen two of the films listed here, and they were quite entertaining. THE SMILING GHOST is a terrific haunted house comedy, and SH! THE OCTOPUS is a silly but breezy little mystery film with some mild horror elements.I'll be glad to remove or revise my review once I have more accurate information to let me decide whether or not to pick it up. If anyone else has it already, please post a review or some comments here.

Season Five of Family Ties may be best remembered for two things: Baby Andrew grew up a LOT over the summer, and Michael J. Fox's amazing performance in the hour-long episode "A, My Name Is Alex."(SPOILERS AHEAD)Brian Bonsall joins the cast as preschool-aged Andrew Keaton. While Bonsall's screentime is understandably limited, the mere fact that Alex's little brother can now speak and interact with the others helps create some great comic moments. Alex also has to deal with the loss of steady girlfriend Ellen (though actress Tracy Pollan would eventually become Mrs. Michael J. Fox in real life). It's also a great year for Nick and Mallory, including probably my all-time favorite scene in which Mallory tries to tutor Nick ("High School Confidential"). And life would continue to imitate art when Tina Yothers tried her hand at singing after Jennifer Keaton joins a band.Still, it's the groundbreaking "A, My Name Is Alex" which leaves the largest impression. Alex is overcome with remorse and self-doubt when he backs out of a commitment to help his friend Greg, and then Greg is killed in a car accident. The second half of the episode, which was presented commercial-free back in 1987, is basically Fox on a darkened stage, with family and friends appearing in little vignettes illustrating key points in Alex's life."Walking into that kitchen was like walking into a hug," Alex observes. And for those of us with fond memories of this quintessential 80's sitcom, here's another 4 discs' worth of hugs.

If you're reading this, chances are you're already a Buster Keaton fan. If you're not, let me just say first off that this set should NOT be your introduction to the legendary comic actor/writer/director. Keaton's masterworks are the silent "two-reel" comedies he made in the twenties (and available in the excellentBuster Keaton Short Films Collection: 1920-1923 (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray], to which this set serves as a companion piece). As many of you will know, Keaton's career fumbled immediately following the silent years, with a 5-year stint making features at MGM. But these films, made for the independent Educational Pictures, represented a return to form of sorts. Here was Keaton back in his element: the comedy short. And Educational also gave him back much of his creative control. . .something he lost working as essentially an actor only for the big studio.Truth be told (and understand, I'm a HUGE fan), most of these sound comedies don't measure up to the gems Keaton made 10 to 15 years earlier. But there's still plenty for fans to enjoy. Unlike silent stars who had difficulty making the transition to sound, Buster had a distinct voice and used it to good effect. He wisely didn't stray too far from his origins; the best bits in these films don't require speaking or much sound at all to make them funny. ONE RUN ELMER and MIXED MAGIC are good examples of this. Keaton's love of trains and physical, architecture-based gags are also in evidence in several films.As for the set itself, the video and audio quality varies a bit from film to film. There is the occasional unrepaired splice, resulting in a "jump" in the action. Debris is evident in many cases, although the overall picture quality is quite good for its age. It's worth noting that Educational Pictures was NOT MGM, and I doubt that the independent company ever made a film as polished as the larger, more affluent studios could. If you've seen the Blu-ray release of the silent shorts, you know what is possible with restoration efforts. I would easily give Kino's earlier release of the silent films 5 stars for visual quality; by comparison, "Lost Keaton" scores 4 out of 5. Still a very good rating.Extras aren't as plentiful as with the earlier set, but you still get a wonderfully informative booklet, with info about each film. There's a still gallery, and a video montage of various stunts and physical gags. And for those who care about such things (as I do), "Lost Keaton"'s package design is virtually identical to the earlier release. . .making a very attractive pair of comedy classics on the shelf. :-)Bottom line: If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer. If you're not (yet), defintiely start with the earlier set first. Buster Keaton was a one-of-kind comic genius, and Kino Lorber has done him proud with this lovingly-created collector's sets.

Although I consider myself a big Superman fan, I somehow missed this show when it premiered in syndication in 1988. As many have already pointed out, the series has not been shown in the U.S. since its initial run, meaning a whole generation of fans probably missed it.So I'm delighted to have it...but...this first season just isn't very good. The writing and acting are uniformly mediocre, with only a handful of decent shows spread throughout the season. Yes, the flying effects are usually on par with the Christopher Reeve films, but the rest of the effects are embarassingly low-budget, largely comprised of obvious animation added to the live action.Like I said, I'm a fan. And despite its MANY flaws, I support this release in the hopes of getting the later seasons.

I'm a little surprised at all the 5-star reviews for this set, as I found season 3 to be a marked decline in quality for this series. And it's not because Lois and Clark finally got together--I'm all for that--but it's the way it was handled. I remember well the spring of 1996 (SPOILERS AHEAD), and my disappointment at how the wedding arc dragged on week after week. Will Lex succeed in taking Lois away from Clark forever? Will Lois get her memory back? Oops! She got it back but lost it again! It's a long black mark in an otherwise decent season.And there was plenty of nice moments: The Lois/Clark/Superman triangle initially showed some comic AND romantic promise...if not for cheesy villains-of-the-week subplots. "Ultra Woman", in which Lois acquires Superman's powers, was a classic. It was nice to finally see Lana Lang, albeit in an alternate reality ("Tempus, Anyone?"). Mindy Church proves to be not such a dumb blonde ("Home Is Where the Hurt Is"). And despite my above grousing about the wedding arc, John Shea gives probably his best performance as Lex finally brings the Man of Steel to his knees ("Seconds"). The season-ending 2-parter was appropriately epic and very engaging, ending on a cliffhanger that would take 2 more episodes to resolve at the start of season 4.If you're a fan of the series, you may be able to overlook some of the shortcomings of season 3. The fourth season, as I recall, wasn't any better.

I do love me some John Mellencamp. Really I do. And I was initially delighted to learn of this release. And the remastered sound is awesome.But...this is some pretty weak material here. Except for I Need a Lover (which is virtually identical to the version we all know and love), there isn't one song I felt like I wanted to listen to again. You can tell John and his band are TRYING to make a hard rockin' record, but the execution is so sloppy, you wonder if it was worth the effort.Recommended only for hardcore fans. I consider myself one, but I'd much rather have a remastered disc of Chestnut Street.

Although he wouldn't reach true mainstream fame until 1982's AMERICAN FOOL, Mellencamp was already giving it his best shot with this surprisingly durable 1980 release. Even the relatively unintiated will recall the singles "This Time" and the simple and still-lovely "Ain't Even Done with the Night." The opening "Hot Night in a Cold Town" sets the stage for an album of longing and reflection (John "Cougar"'s untrained voice does little to diminish the power of the heart-aching "To M.G., Wherever She May Be"), and sensual urgency (the downright horny "Tonight").Sure, not every song is a gem. Although nostalgia for 50's and 60's cover songs would later permeate John's live shows (and occasional studio recordings), 28 seconds of "Peppermint Twist" feels like a cheat. And the a capella "Cry Baby" is a juvenile joke that's barely funny once; you'll probably program your player to skip it in the future.The bonus track here is a little strange, since it was apparently recorded for the American Fool sessions. "Latest Game" is nothing special, a blue-collar variation on Sammy Hagar's "I've Done Everything For You."Of course, the true kick for fans is that the album has been remastered, and the results of that alone are worth the low price of this CD. I for one look forward to burning my own personal Mellen-Mix, and adding a few of the tracks here to match the sound quality of the more recent releases.

Even if, like myself, you purchased the original Universal Monster discs a few years ago, you still need to get this set. Mainly, of course, because it is the first time HOUSE OF DRACULA has been released on DVD. But beyond that, the package itself is a great way to condense so much material into only 6 discs. And the Sideshow busts have to be seen to be fully appreciated. Like the other licensed Universal products the company offers, the attention to detail in these polystone treasures is remarkable.If I have one minor quibble, it's that the way the films and features are laid out on the discs can be confusing. No matter which of the 3 sides of a particular collection (Frankenstein, Dracula or Wolfman) you pop in the player, the initial menu offers your choice of any of the 4 or 5 films. Unless you carefully examine the back of of the box for the contents, you'll find yourself having to put in another disc about 2/3 of the time. And die-hard Wolfman fans take note: The only thing missing from the set is the trailer for The Wolfman (which was available in the previous single-disc release). Well, that, and there is still no trailer for Son of Frankenstein.But these are minor points, when one considers what you are getting for the money. That's 14 undisputable classics of the Golden Age of horror (well...13, maybe. She-Wolf of London is, hands-down, the nadir of the studio's output of the period). You also get a wealth of first-rate documentaries and commentary tracks, some brief but informative interviews with VAN HELSING director Stephen Sommers, and did I mention that no monster fan can live without those lovingly-crafted busts?Order it now!!

I'm a huge fan of classic animation from the 30's, so I'm delighted to have this large collection at such a great price. But I do think people who prefer the laughs of Warner Bros. or the polish of Disney shorts will be disappointed. Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper aren't exactly household names, and it's not hard to see why. The cartoons, though well-made, lack much personality and the action is too often repetitive.The picture and sound quality varies from fair to good, with many of the ComicColor 'toons looking a bit washed out. Flip, in basic black & white, at least looks better than the color cartoons in this collection.Still, for the price, it's worth having if you're into this sort of thing.

I'm always amused by a friend who claims to have found great deals on old movies on DVD, only to be repeatedly burned by another cheap hack job by companies like Goodtimes or (in this case) Alpha Video. So it was with some trepidation I approached this one...I was already familiar with the film, having long ago purchased a VHS copy from a slightly-more reputable company than those mentioned above. But after seeing this washed-out mess, with its numerous missing frames and audio dropouts, I might as well have used my DVD recorder to copy my VHS. The ONLY thing to recommend this disc over my tape is the inclusion of a trailer, which is in itself an oddity for Alpha. It's nice to have, but it's actually, unbelievably, in worse condition than the film.ASSIGNMENT: OUTER SPACE itself is a pretty good little Italian space opera. As a kid watching these kinds of films on late-nite television, I always thrilled at seeing outer space scenes, spaceships, astronauts floating around, etc. And the film certainly delivers on those. And there is a real plot in there, too. Much has been said about how irritating Rik Von Nutter's reporter character is. But truthfully, these sorts of films are rarely a showcase for great acting. I found most of the characters acceptable, if unremarkable. And the reporter in space idea was probably pretty fresh in 1961.Until a better transfer pops up, I'd recommend this disc only for sci-fi completists.

Ahh...the seventies. I remember really liking this one as a kid. If you've never seen it: Think "Superfriends" in space. The animation is classic 70's Filmmation. In other words, not really very good. But the stories are reasonably well-done, although this is strictly kids' stuff (the robot Moe is particularly grating to my adult mentality).The bottom line is, Space Sentinels is a nice nostalgic trip if you were between the ages of 5 and 12 in 1977. For most everyone else, it's probably not worth owning.

After suffering through bootleg copies of this film under the "Horror Hotel" title for years, this DVD was a welcome addition to my classic horror film libary. Now that a nearly-flawless print of the film is available, I hope it will start to get the attention it deserves.City of the Dead was made during the horror revival that began in 1957 with Hammer'sCurse of Frankenstein. This was a time when the creaky old horror formulas of Universal (don't get me wrong, I love 'em) were giving way to more graphic scares, as audiences began to expect to SEE more than what their imaginations could provide. Yet the film is something of an anomaly, in that it retains a gothic visual style without relying heavily on special effects.Student Nan Barlow (then-newcomer Venetia Stevenson) is sent by her professor (Christopher Lee) to the New England town of Whitewood to research her paper on witchcraft. Local legend tells of a witch who was burned there in 1692. As Nan delves into the town's history, she encounters a host of diverse characters, many of whom seem to believe Whitewood is still under satanic influence. I don't want to give away one of the major plot points for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say the story takes a shocking left turn about midway through the film. Not everything is what it seems, and no one may be safe.As for the disc itself, VCI is to be applauded for their efforts here. The film looks terrific, and even though the sound is mono, it's clear and uniform throughout. The interviews and commentary tracks are nice for fans of the film, but may come off a bit dry to casual viewers. Venitia Stevenson, in a 2001 interview, seems just a tad embarassed and/or mystified by the film's popularity. Lee, who pontficates at-length about his career, has the misfortune of being saddled with a rather irritating on-screen interviewer. The only other real problem, a common one with VCI, is that the menu takes a little getting used to.After languishing in b-movie hell for decades, I think it's time City of the Dead was elevated to "classic" status. This fully-loaded--and attractively-priced--disc should go a long way towards that end.

I had three surprises in theaters in 2006, all of which seemed to have the odds against them going in. A new Superman? It worked just fine. A new James Bond? The greatest cinematic makeover in history. Now, here comes the same ol' Rocky. And for the most part, it was another welcome return.If ever a person was born to play a part, Rocky Balboa is it for Sylvester Stallone. Say what you will about the crass commercialism of Rocky's 3, 4, and 5, Sly rarely missed a beat. Well, OK, there wasn't much to love about Rocky 5. But even the lesser sequels got one thing right: Stallone stayed true to the character.Wisely, he chose to write and direct this (one can only hope) final installment, a fitting bookend to the saga. Stallone has always been smarter than the characters he plays, and his script strikes a good balance between drama and self-deprecating humor. [SPOILERS AHEAD] When a bunch of young punks throw a few verbal jabs at the aging ex-champ, their words ring true. . .yet you can't help but feel for the guy. This may be a minority opinion, but I think this is easily Stallone's finest ACTING performance of the series. That's right, I said ACTING.Sure, the film eventually lapses into the predicable training montage, and maybe one too many speeches from the Italian Stallion. But by taking the time to make you care about the characters again--it's been 16 years, after all--you may find yourself cheering in spite of yourself.Now, on to the DVD itself. We get a witty and insightful commentary from the Man himself. There's also an alternate ending that shows just how much Stallone (and Rocky) has matured. . .twenty years ago, the more predictable, less-satisfying ending would probably have made the final cut. A bunch of delted scenes are included, offering a bit more screen time for Burt Young's Paulie (who, incidentally, also gets my vote for best performance of the six ROCKY films).If you've read this far, you're probably a big enough ROCKY fan to make the purchase. It's a fine conclusion to the series, a story with heart and humor. . .and let's face it, that's become a rare combination these days.

As a lifelong fan of classic animation, I simply could not be more THRILLED at the prospect of finally owning restored versions of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons. Other reviewers have expertly detailed the contents of this set, so I'd like to take a moment to try and convince/convert those folks who may not know and love these things as much as I do. . .There has been, as long as I can recall, a misconception about Popeye cartoons. I recently had this discussion with a good friend, who could not understand why I was so excited about this release. She, like so many people, was raised on the color Popeye cartoons made in the 1960's. "They're all the same," she complained. "Popeye and Bluto fight over Olive Oyl, and Popeye eats spinach and beats up his rival. Big deal." And you know something? Based solely on the cartoons my friend had seen, she was right. She knew nothing of these original black & white gems made by the Fleischers beginning in the early 1930's. And while the voice of Popeye in most of those shorts is the same (Jack Mercer) as the later ones, that's where the similarities end. The early 'toons are full of creative gags, ad-libs and boundless energy. Plus, they have the inimitable Fleischer style, which can also be found in Betty Boop and, later, the first Superman cartoons.I hope that those of you who only know Popeye from the later, bland incarnations will check out this set. Forget Poopdeck Pappy or Popeye's nephews (those these will eventually surface in the Fleischer versions); this is the REAL POPEYE in all his elastic, mumbling glory.Essential viewing for Popeye enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the early history of animated sound cartoons.P.S. I wish I could get back all the money I've blown on cheapskate VHS and DVD versions by Goodtimes, etc. Those things are headed for a garage sale faster than you can say "I yam what I yam!"

OK, so unlike several others here, I liked THE BATMAN from the beginning. Even so, I have to say that I think it's gotten even better over the years. As of this writing, I haven't seen any of season 5 (I prefer to wait for the DVD's so I can get 'em all at once), but season 4 is by far the best season yet.Hardcore Batfans have traditionally been slow to warm-up to the "sidekick" characters of Robin and Batgirl. And I'll admit I was initally reluctant to embrace either of them in ANY incarnation of Batman. So imagine my surprise when, after only 3 or 4 episodes, I found that the interplay between Batgirl and the Boy Wonder is among my favorites things about this season. They're really just kids, after all, and their good-natured sibling rivalry is handled with wit and intelligence.There's not really a bad episode in the bunch, but I'll mention a few favorites: "Strange New World" calls to mind the excellent feature-lengthBatman vs. Draculaand is among the most exciting episodes of the entire series; "Artifacts" and the "The Joining" (easily the best episode) feed fans' appetite for glimpses of the future with appearances by Nightwing, Oracle, and the Justice League; and "Two of a Kind" re-imagines Harley Quinn for a new generation of Batman fans. Even the recurring rogues' gallery gets some standout stories: We get more background on the Riddler in "Riddler's Revenge," and Bruce Wayne's old friend Ethan Bennett (a.k.a. Clayface) gets a chance at redemption in "Clayfaces."Not much in the way of extras this time around, just a brief featurette on season 4, and a preview of the upcoming direct-to-video Justice League movie.If you still haven't discovered this high-octane reinterpretation of the Batman mythology, season 4 is a great place to start. Highly recommended.

I won't spend a lot of time dissecting the episode; other reviews have done that for you. But I will say that I think "A Christmas Carol" is an episode that gets better with repeat viewings. As I write this, we're about 2 months out from Christmas 2010, and I've just watched the show for the fourth time. Naturally, it plays much better around the holiday itself, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed it "out of season" as well. Yes, [Minor spoilers ahead] the shark is still kind of silly, and the story is probably a bit too ambitious for its own good. But it's also very beautiful to watch, gorgeously filmed and the actors pull off their parts with conviction. I expect that all but the most jaded of Doctor Who fans will make this a part of their annual holiday viewing.Now, more about the Blu-ray disc itself. The show has been filming in the HD format for the past two years, and looks amazing. One expects them to spend more time and money on the Christmas episode, and it really shows here. One reviewer complained that the episode was "too dark" in places, and I can't disagree. But the lighter moments really sparkle. Katherine Jenkins is a beautiful woman in ANY definition, but looks simply incredible in "A Christmas Carol."The other real treat on the disc, though, is the "Doctor Who at the Proms 2010." As you probably know, the Proms feature the show's music played live at the Royal Albert Hall, along with giant screen projecting scenes from the series and live actors interacting with the audience. I can only imagine the thrill of seeing this event in person, but just watching it at home is still very fulfilling. An extended tribute to the previous Doctor, David Tennant, is the emotional highpoint of the show. Matt Smith and Karen Gillan also make appearances.Lastly, there's the "cut-down" version of Doctor Who Confidential, the behind-the-scenes program for the Christmas special. I've always found the Confidential shows to be fun and imformative, although I don't understand why BBC video never puts the full hour-long programs on these discs.Lastly, there's a rumor that although "A Christmas Carol" will be included in the Series 6 box set, the Proms special will NOT. As I said, at this point, this is a RUMOR. In the meantime, I have chosen not to wait and see. And if you're really a Doctor Who fan, you'll support each new release (in my opinion, anyway). And the Christmas special is absolutely worth owning. When you add the bonus materials and the HD presentation, I say "Why wait?"

I'm a little surprised by all the 5 star ratings for Freedom's Road. It's certainly not a bad album, but it all seems a tad bland to me. Mellencamp and his band sound fine, as usual. But the lyrics are often simplistic. . .something one would never expect from one of the greatest living songwriters still working today.Consider "The Americans": The idea of America as a "melting pot" for all kinds of cultural beliefs is hardly groundbreaking. And the thing is all over the map, in terms of trying to please everybody. John's singing actually sounds a bit forced (again, not what you would expect) in the title track. And the admittedly tragic story of a ten year old girl being raped ("Rural Route") is sabotaged by incessant repetition of the song's title throughout.But that doesn't mean Freedom's Road doesn't have it share of good moments. The opening number, "Someday" may be the best sixties song since that decade ended. Legendary folk singer Joan Baez lends her unique voice to "Jim Crow." And "Heaven Is a Lonely Place" is a spirited benediction, ripe with typical Mellencamp characters struggling to survive their own ignorance.Look, I own every one of John's albums, and I still think he's a great artist. . .one of the best we've got. But Freedom's Road just isn't his best work, by a long shot. If I had to compare it to a previous release, it might be 2001's "Cuttin' Heads". . .a few really good tracks, and uninspired (if well-performed) filler. I'd recommend this one for die-hard fans only.

This was a great idea, I don't understand why more fans of Batman The Animated Series didn't like it. I like the futuristic touches, even though the characters are still not too far-removed from the present. The music, the action, and just plain ENERGY of the show are all top-notch.Warner Bros. has done another great job of providing animation fans with an affordable way to collect our favorite shows. Can't wait for more!

Long live Distort-O! What a fun concept. Turn off the lights, it's easy to picture yourself in a drive-in. In addition to the &quot;low-fi&quot; sound of the movie, you also get ambient noises like cars coming &amp; going, people talking, etc. As for the movies, they're standard drive-in flicks. Low budget, bad acting, cheesy effects...the works. But you already know what you're getting into if you pay to see a movie called &quot;Attack of the Giant Leeches.&quot; No fan of 50's cheese can do without this technically impressive double feature.

Once again, the folks at Universal have given us something to get excited about. Here are all 6 of the studio's "Inner Sanctum" mysteries in one low-priced set. Fans of Lon Chaney Jr. who were disappointed with Image's recent "Lon Chaney Collection" will certainly find much to love here. I'll readily admit that he lacked the acting chops of his contemporaries like Karloff and Lugosi, but his roles here are varied and give this "black sheep" of Universal horror a chance to shine.Remember, these feature-length (well...most of them clock in at just over an hour) films were based on the popular radio series of the same name. As such, they tend to be a bit "talky." But the production values are high, and a couple of the stories actually generate some suspense. In addition to the sharp black & white photography, the best thing about these films is probably the supporting cast. Frequent Chaney co-star Evelyn Ankers, as well as Universal players Anne Gwynne and J. Carroll Naish are on-hand to lend support to the affable Chaney. Some of the humor hasn't aged well, but that's hardly uncommon for films of this period.I hope Universal will continue the trend set by this and the "Boris Karloff Collection," and release more of their lesser-known films from the vaults, such as Man Made Monster and Night Monster. For now, we can enjoy these almost-forgotten gems from Hollywood's Golden Age.

Here's a real treat: A non-Hammer pairing of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee from 1965, which actually outshines much of the work the pair did for Hammer. The simple yet highly engaging story (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD) centers around the title object, the alleged skull of the infamous Marquis de Sade. When Christopher Maitland (Cushing) acquires the stolen skull, he consults with its former owner (Lee), who warns Maitland that he'd probably be much better off without it.Soon, the skull is possessing those around it, inciting them to kill. Maitland himself eventually succumbs to its evil influence, and Cushing admirably carries much of the film alone, propelled by Elisabeth Lutyen's eerie, jangly score. Director Freddie Francis keeps the camera moving, even boldy setting up several shots from the skull's point-of-view. And the skull itself is a marvellously unsettling prop--as much a character in the film as the flesh-and-blood ones. The technicolor photography is gorgeous to look at, and has been lovingly reproduced for this DVD.The only extra included is the terrific theatrical trailer, which gives away a bit too much, but will certainly make viewers want to see the entire film. In fact, I'd suggest watching it before the movie to really whet your appetite for a good old-fashioned chiller in the classic mold. Highly recommended for fans of classic horror.

You know, I'm not one of those people who insists movies be presented in widescreen. Especially for older movies, it's just not that big of a deal. But TARGET EARTH screams out for a widescreen transfer from the first HORRIBLY CROPPED FRAME. You can't even read most of the opening credits because of the sloppy transfer job. It's inexcusable, especially when you refer back to the box and see &quot;Widescreen&quot; prominently printed on the cover.Having said that, this was my first exposure to this taut, cheap little invasion flick, and I was fairly impressed. The black &amp; white photography adds much to the feeling of isolation and desperation experienced by the characters. And the robot is pretty decent, by 50's sci-fi standards. Heckuva climax, too. But you'll have to see that for yourself.Recommended for any fan of classic science fiction.

It's pretty much universally acknowledged that Soap's final season was not its best. I think a large part of the blame can be attributed to the additon of several new writers to the staff. The brilliant Susan Harris was still at the wheel, but must have lost some control over the other writers. Characters we've grown to know and love seem to have changed for the worse. Two of the best-loved ones (played by, arguably, the show's best comic actors), Jessica and Burt, suddenly became less sympathetic. And Danny Dallas was certainly never that bright, but he seems to have undergone a lobotomy by the fourth season. Dutch and Eunice became increasingly irritating, Billy and the Major were neglected; and of course the loss of Diana Canova as Corinne didn't help matters.And let me join in the chorus of Soap fans unhappy with the DVD presentation of this, the FINAL Soap set we'll ever see. A retrospective segment would seem essential, considering the way the show ended. We know the creators are still out there, as well as several cast members. Longtime fans will recall that the ghost(?) of Jessica Tate appeared in the 5th season of BENSON in an episode appropriately titled "God, I Need This Job." What a terrific "extra" that would have been for this set.I give it 3 stars simply because Soap was a fantastic, funny, touching and original show. And even with the aforementioned detriments, season four wasn't a complete waste. And if you're a fan of the show, you'll want to have it. I just wish Sony would have spent a little more time and effort to reward our loyalty.

First off, I admit that it pains me to find fault in such an obvious labor of love. Mr. Lennig must certainly be the Greatest Living Bela Lugosi Fan, and it shows. The Immortal Count is painstakingly detailed in its accounts of both the content and construction of Lugosi's films. But for all its technical prowess, Lennig's writing vacilates between professional criticism and amateurish defensivness.For example: The author laments the he himself was maligned in another book, Universal Horrors. Like a child who's just been called a bad name, Lennig makes reference to "smart-ass critics." Does anyone reading this book CARE what other critics think of the author? It's a moment of self-indulgence that does not belong in what should be--by virute of volume alone--the definitive study of the films of Bela Lugosi.There is much concensus among film critics that Lugosi himself often bended the truth to his will, especially in interviews conducted during his final years. Reading THE IMMORTAL COUNT, one suspects Arthur Lenning has, himself, succumbed to the same malady. He appears ready to defend his subject's shortcomings at every turn. While such hero worship can be charming, in this context it seems unprofessional.The other, somewhat lesser, problem I found with the book is that the author often feels it necessary to give virtually shot-by-shot descriptions of the films. Lennig has many "behind-the-scenes" tales to tell, and these should make up the bulk of the material.If the film descriptions could be trimmed, and the irrelevant asides excised, I believe THE IMMORTAL COUNT would be very close to the defintive Lugosi history we fans have been waiting for. As it stands, it's a lovingly-crafted but highly-flawed work.

When you look at some of the t.v. shows, old and new, that get DVD releases, it seems a crime that this brilliant sitcom has largely been ignored. For the uninitiated, DOBIE GILLIS followed the unlucky-in-love title character (Dwayne Hickman) through four seasons of comic misadventures from 1959-1963. Dobie and his beatnik buddy Maynard G. Krebbs (a pre-Gilligan Bob Denver) led a cast of zany characters. There was Frank Faylen as Dobie's long-suffering father ("I gotta kill that boy...I just gotta"), Sheila James as his unwanted pursuer Zelda Gilroy. . .plus early roles for Tuesday Weld (as Dobie's ultimate fantasy, the unattainable Thalia Menninger) and Warren Beatty.DOBIE's premise and its characters have been likened to the popular Archie comic books. . .and that's probably a valid analogy. While Maynard's interests lay primarily in listening to jazz and avoiding work, Dobie was steadfast in his pursuit of the elusive "perfect girl." He was a dreamer who was given to poetic gestures and philosophic observations on the nature of the opposite sex. These weren't just acted out, however. At the beginning and end of most episodes, Dobie addressed the camera directly with his observations and endless questions. It's just one of many characteristics that set the show apart from its competition. That. . .plus a flawless cast of comic actors and sharp, fast-paced writing.I appeal to whatever entity controls the rights to this almost-forgotten gem of classic television: Please bring Dobie back to our living rooms with a DVD release!

OK, there are currently over 400 reviews telling you how good or bad "Halloween II" is. Chances are, if you're reading this, you already have your own opinion of the film itself and want to know about the Blu-ray. The transfer is quite good, although not perfect. Unlike the 1978 original film, this one takes place all in one night. And some of the scenes are pretty dark. Still, it's probably the best the film will ever look on the home screen, so I'm reasonably satisfied with the picture quality. Unfortunately, the sound suffers a malady common to too many discs: You have to really jack it up to hear people talk at times, only to have your walls shaken by a sudden sting of music during a scary moment.The real treat that no one seem to be talking about, however, is the bonus feature film included. "Terror in the Aisles" was a theatrical release way back in 1983. The Universal-produced feature is a compilation of scary moments from films from the 50's through the early 80's. Co-hosts and frequent genre stars Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen not only narrate, but sit in a crowded theater watching the film clips. The theater scenes are generally a bit cheesy, but not really out of line with the often irreverent tone of the film. I remember watching this one in the theater back in the day, and I'm delighted to finally have a copy. As far as I know, it was previously only available on a long out-of-print VHS tape.If you're a fan of the movie, this is certainly a must-have (especially at the current low price). But even folks who are just fans of horror cinema in general should pick it up for Terror in the Aisles. Aside from the aforementioned technical deficits, it's a welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.

Based on the first in a series of children's books by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, ALICE UPSIDE DOWN offers up the familiar-yet-pleasing-enough story of a sixth grader Alice McKinley, as she faces the challenges of trying to fit in in a new school. I haven't read any of the books, but the movie follows the "tween" girl-power formula popularized by the likes of Hannah Montana and any number of Disney-style adolescent comedies.Among the well-worn cliches (boys are either icky or hot, single dad Luke Perry fumbles through cooking a Thanksgiving dinner), the best thing about ALICE is Alice herself, played with believable awkwardness by Alyson Stoner.High School Musical (Encore Edition)'s Lucas Grabeel is fine as Alice's older brother, and Penny Marshall is the reputed meanest teacher in the sixth grade. The rest of the cast is really average, with Perry in particular looking rather bored.Parents can rest assured, it's perfectly fine for your kids to take ALICE home. It's quite inoffensive, but may be a bit too bland for older teens.

Note: This review contains SPOILERS.This is an issue that has divided Beauty & The Beast fans for almost twenty years, and reading the reviews here, I can see a lot of people are still bitter. While the show certainly suffered the loss of Linda Hamilton, I personally found there was still plenty to enjoy in this abbreviated season.For one thing, the season-long story arc served the show quite well. The second season's cliffhanger ending left a lot for the writers to explore. So much fuss was made way back in 1989 about the show being "retooled" to attract more male viewers. And I'll admit, there's probably a sizable portion of the potential male viewing audience that is attracted to the increased action and violence. But was the show really THAT different? We still have Ron Perlman and all the others giving it their all (and it was quite an emotional and yes, violent arc for Vincent). The late, talented Edward Albert got moved into a series regular slot. And I can't think of another series villain as vile as Stephen McHattie's Gabriel. And for you action fans, there's Lance Henriksen's appearance as the vicious assassin, Snow.Even amid all the death and sorrow, there are moments of beauty. "Walk Slowly," the follow-up to the 2-hour season premiere, is one of the best-written episodes of the entire series. Jo Anderson is no Linda Hamilton, but she evidences real concern and determination to help Vincent. And the return of Rolley (from season two's "Chamber Music") evokes sympathy, as well as reminds us that there was always more to this fictional universe than just Vincent and Catherine.To the uninitiated who may not have seen this season: It's really not as bad as many people would have you believe. If you accept that Linda Hamilton only appears in 2 episodes, maybe that will lessen your potential disappointment. And if you've followed the story this far, it just makes sense to see it through to the end. No, it's NOT as good as the first two years. But it's still a great show, and I hope you will give it a chance.The only other concern I have, as others have pointed out, is that the asking price for a shortened (12 episodes) season is the same as for a full season. But as any true fan will tell you, it's something of a minor miracle that we're finally getting season 3 on home video in ANY format. I'm grateful for that, and I have no hesitation in shelling out the $$ to complete my set.

Here's a real treat for us classic monster and sci-fi fans. Check out that cover art--it's a replica of an Aurora plastic model kit that many of us recall from childhood.Fifty creature feature trailers will keep you occupied for awhile. Among the highlights: KING KONG, SON OF KONG, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, MOTHRA, IT CONQUERED THE WORLD, THEM, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, THE BLOB, THE KILLER SHREWS (darn funny trailer). Many, many more, including the wonderful Sinbad films.As you might expect, the quality of the clips varies greatly. Overall, the picture and sound quality is acceptable. The 1950's nuclear safety film is a hoot!If you like these kind of films, you really should add this one to your collection. Even if you could never sit through some of cheesy flicks represented here, the trailer compilation is a fun party disc. Recommended.

Along with KISS OF THE VAMPIRE, this is the archtypal Hammer vamp flick of the 60's. The gorgeous Yvonne Monlaur is reason enough to buy this movie. It's a shame she didn't do many other films (see her in CIRCUS OF HORRORS). So, as you may have heard, there is no Dracula in this movie. But there is Van Helsing, always excellently essayed by Peter Cushing. And there are vampire &quot;brides&quot;, a memorable resurrection scene with a cackling Freda Jackson, and very nice production values to recommend BRIDES OF DRACULA. Personally, I find it more exciting than the highly-praised next entry in the series, DRACULA PRINCE OF DARKNESS (not that I dislike that film, mind you). It's certainly one of Terence Fisher's best, one of Hammer's best, and just one of the THE best.

Although it's seldom mentioned in critical surveys of classic horror, BURN, WITCH BURN (aka Night of the Eagle) is a terrific example of how far a film can travel on mood and characterization. When a college professor learns his wife has been practicing black magic, he orders her to throw out or destory all her charms and occult items. What he doesn't count on is that other practioners of the "dark arts" won't stand idly by while one of their own is forced to give up her witchy ways.BURN, WITCH BURN bears a favorable resemblance to Jacques Tourner's excellentCurse of the Demon / Night of the Demon: Moody black & white photography, strong performances, and a lead character who is doggedly determined to debunk the supernatural, even though he is surrounded by overwhelming evidence of its existence. This culminates in a still nail-biting supernatural attack by a giant bird (hence the otherwise rather misleading "Night of the Eagle" alternate title for the film).MGM has recently entered the "manufactured on demand" market, making disc on DVD-R's as ordered, to keep down costs. While this may cause concern to viewers worried about quality in our High Definition World, rest assured that MGM has done a proper digital restoration with this one. While there are no extras included, this is typical of these MOD releases. Those of us who have spent years waiting or searching for favorite genre films to finally receive an "official" release understand that this may the only way in the forseeable future we will have the chance to own these films.If you like old black & white horror films, this is a must-buy. Also recommended:City Of The DeadandDevils Of Darkness / Witchcraft.

Well, I came along too late to have seen these programs on t.v. in the fifties. But I can't imagine I would have enjoyed them anymore than I did today! I don't think it's an exaggeration to say the &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; programs may be the BEST documentaries I have ever seen. Who else but Walt Disney (teaming up with space exploration pioneers like Willie Ley and Warner Von Braun) could make a series like this that ANYONE can enjoy, even 50 years after their release?Yes, some of the speculative material therein has been proven wrong over the years. That's part of their charm...the people who made these things seem certain that their ideas would become reality. And speaking of charm, anyone with even a passing interest in the history of animation simply MUST have this set. I don't think any other Disney production looks quite like this. The episode on Mars in particular contains some of the most bizarre images, animated or otherwise, to ever appear on screen.I would highly recommend this to anyone (1)like I said, with an interest in animation; (2)interested in the history of astronomy; (3)who likes 50's science-fiction or science-fact. And of course, anyone who likes classic Disney should have bought this one already.If I had the money I'd buy it FOR you. But I don't...so do yourself a favor and get this one before it's gone.

I have kinda lukewarm feelings about this one. I watched all the incarnations of Superfriends in the 70's and 80's, so I'll just tell you what I think was good and not-so-good about Galactic Guardians:GOOD: Firestorm. A unique character with cool powers (was there anything he COULDN'T do?).NOT-SO-GOOD: Cyborg. Nothing wrong with the character per se, but he was used for too much comic relief. For modern-day Justice League fans, think of Flash but not funny. At all.GOOD: The use of ongoing villains like Darkseid, foreshadowing the Superman and JL stuff that would come 15-20 years later.NOT-SO-GOOD: Bizarro Planet. Ugh...I just can't talk about it.GOOD: No more Wonder Twins, Zan and Jayna or other insipid kid-friendly sidekicks.NOT-SO-GOOD: Adam West as Batman. Sorry, but it's impossible for me to hear that voice in a reasonably serious adaptation of Batman without thinking of the campy, crappy 60's t.v. series.GOOD: Better animation all-around. It's nice to see Superman with muscles without having him looked pissed-off like he started to look in comics around 1990.GOOD: Some stories focus on only 2 or 3 characters at a time, instead of trying to cram everyone into the action. Best example is the Batman origin story "The Fear." This is something the latter-day Justice League accomplished in spite of horribly cheap animation.Well, you can see the Good outweighs the Not-So-Good. And if you're a fan, you may not be bothered by any of the stuff I mentioned. For anyone who grew up in the seventies, "Challenge of the Superfriends" remains the all-time best incarnation. But there's still plenty to hold your interest here. Recommended for fans; casual viewers may want to rent first.

We classic Looney Tunes fans will, naturally, forever debate which cartoons WB should include on each set. But what impresses me about Vol. 5 is that there is a little more variety spread out over the discs. I mean, there's no point arguing the merits of a classic Bugs Bunny cartoon. . .but I've seen them all many times before. I'm more interested in seeing the early stuff (Disc 4) or some of the lesser-known but brilliant work like the Fairy Tale 'toons (Disc 2).Warner Bros. has set the gold standard (pardon the pun) for extras, and Vol. 5 is no exception. As a lifelong Chuck Jones fan, I've had "Inbetween & Extremes" for years, but the single-disc documentary by itself costs about half the price of one of these Golden Collections. . .so it's a good thing to have. I expect the casual viewer doesn't care all that much about having more Private Snafu cartoons, but I think they've VERY important parts of both animation history and American history, for that matter.Looney Tunes fans, though fickle as ever when picking their favorites, at least seem to be a fiercely loyal bunch in supporing each new Golden Collection DVD release. As I said in my review forLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume Four, we've still got a long way to go. So keep it up, Doc!

This is an odd collection, but certainly not a bad idea. For people who didn't discover Bon Jovi until their breakthrough SLIPPERY WHEN WET, their self-titled debut album is a surprisingly durable blast of 80's pop/metal.NEW JERSEY received a far less favorable critical reception than SLIPPERY, but it's hardly a dud album. There are 5 hit songs, and even the filler isn't as bad as cheesy SLIPPERY cuts like "I'd Die For You" or "Social Disease."But the real treat here is finally getting a remastered version of BLAZE OF GLORY. All the Bon Jovi catalog titles have been remastered, up through 1995's THESE DAYS. But Jon Bon Jovi's solo project, tied to the film YOUNG GUNS II had been largely ignored until now. Only two hits, the title song and the all-but-forgotten gem "Miracle," are here. But the disc itself is more focused and listenable than much of the band's output from the 90's.If you don't already have the remastered discs, this is a reasonable investment.

During all those late nights my brother and I would stay up catching great old movies like this, I would have never dreamed I'd one day be able to own this almost-forgotten classic, and in such a deluxe format. There may be more high-profile sixties sci-fi films, but almost none of them achieve the level of sophistication and technical prowess of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.The film is, of course, a space-age variation on the classic Robinson Crusoe survival tale. Paul Mantee is the lone U.S. astronaut who gets stranded--along with Mona the Monkey--on the Red Planet. While struggling to survive a hostile alien environment, Mantee realizes he's not quite alone on Mars. I don't want to give away any more plot details, because you really need to see this classic film yourself.As expected, Criterion has polished this gem of a movie to sparkling perfection. Outside ofForbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition), few big-budget science-fiction films have made such imaginative use of color, sets and effects. The print is virtually flawless, and the bright reds of the Martian landscape almost leap off the screen.Extras: There's a great (and long) theatrical trailer, an informative documentary which discusses the science of Robinson Crusoe on Mars, a Criterion-produced music video for the well-intentioned (though sonically hideous) song "Robinson Crusoe on Mars" by co-star Victor Lundin, and alternate audio commentary from two of the film's stars and screenwriter Ib Melchoir.Robinson Crusoe on Mars certainly belongs in any classic sci-fi fan's collection. And it's unlikely that anyone will ever improve upon this first-class job by Criterion. Highly recommended.

I've got to get one thing out of the way first, for all those who didn't like Terminator 3. The Sarah Connor Chronicles does NOT pretend T3 doesn't exist, it addressed one of major issues in the film in its first 2 episodes. And since this is sci-fi, complete with time travel, there's no reason that history (even future history) can't be re-written.To the folks who think the action is "great...for a t.v. show," I can only assume they haven't been watching t.v. in the last 10 years or so. There have been several shows that far eclipse what is being done in movies (Buffy, Alias, two more girl-power shows just off the top of my head).What really surprised me about the show is how faithful it is to the first and second movies. In just this shortened (9 episodes) first season, we've seen the following characters from the films appear: Miles Dyson's widow and son, Dr. Silverman, Enrique and Kyle Reese.As for the cast, Lena Headly is no Linda Hamilton, but her voice-overs became more and more convincing and even poignant as the episodes progressed. And of course, what sci-fi geek didn't salivate over the news ofFirefly - The Complete Series's Summer Glau being cast in the pivotal role of female cyborg Cameron. And considering John Connor has been played by 3 different actors, Thomas Decker acquits himself quite well. He's less irritating than Edward Furlong, by a long shot.If the show has a flaw, it's that at times it does feel a little too familiar. One has to wonder how long the writers will be able to sustain Sarah and John's journey, without really damaging the integrity of the film series. And I realize CGI is the norm for special effects these days, but give me a REAL metal (or at least plastic that looks like metal) endoskeleton over this computer-generated mess any day.I think The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a fine continuation of the Terminator universe. No, it's not that rare series that's actually BETTER than the movies (OK, it's not THAT rare in sci-fi...seeStargate SG-1 - The Complete Series CollectionorBuffy The Vampire Slayer - Collector's Set (40 discs)), but it's certainly among the best t.v. adaptations of movie storyline. With great casting, well-executed action, and suprisingly intelligent writing, it's a winner.

I'm a huge fan of both Halloween and Looney Tunes, so I was intially very excited about this release. Using new animated footage to bridge clips from classic-era 'toons was a common practice after the studio ceased production on their theatrical shorts in the late 1960's. As a child in the seventies (I was 10 when this special aired), I'm sure I didn't give much thought to whether the old and the new mixed well. As an adult, however, it is easy to see the sometimes jarring differences. Most of the new scenes include Bugs and Witch Hazel, and the artwork for both just doesn't match the old clips. Even the voices are a little off, which is especially frustrating since both Mel Blanc and June Foray reprised their roles from the original cartoons.Will kids notice the discrepancies? Maybe not, unless they've been shown the old cartoons over and over. But it is worth noting that BUGS BUNNY'S HOWL-OWEEN SPECIAL is a children's t.v. special, whereas the Golden Age Looney Tunes were theatrical shorts that were NOT necessarily aimed at young viewers. But parents looking for some inoffensive holiday entertainment need not worry; even a potentially eyebrow-raising line like the bunny's politically-incorrect "Aren't they [women] all witches underneath?" has been re-dubbed with some throwaway line about Halloween.The only extra feature here is the uncut version of "Hair-Raising Hare," mispelled as "Hare Raising Hare" on the DVD menu. With the bonus cartoon, the whole things clocks in at just 30 minutes (not 35 as stated on the box).Like I said, I'm a fan. And I'll continue to support future Looney Tunes releases. But this isn't one I'll be viewing over and over.

Like another reviewer here, I collected the individual Garfield books when I was around 10 or 11 years old. I've long since lost those treasured and well-worn volumes, so this was a real treat (not to mention quite a bargain).A word of warning, though, to those who didn't follow Jim Davis' comic cat from the beginning: The early strips--mostly volume one here--are quite different from the Garfield we came to know and love. Rather than being pleasantly plump, the original Garfield was kinda mean and scary-looking. But the cynical wit was there from the beginning, as well as John, Odie and a few other soon-to-be-forgotten characters (Lyman, anyone?).I personally think the best was yet to come when these books were originally published. But there's still much to love. And for a Garfield fan, this is simply a must-have.

I'm something of a collector of sci-fi and horror film trailers, and I really enjoyed seeing some of the rare clips in this collection. I'm not bragging, but I have close to 300 trailers in my collection, and I'd never seen over half of these. Even one, for HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, differs significantly from the one I'd seen many times elseswhere. And there are some fairly obscure ones: From Hell It Came, The Cyclops, Dr. Terror's House of Horrors...to name just a few.As with most compilations of this kind, the image quality varies. But overall, I'd rate these trailers in the GOOD to VERY GOOD category. Sound is uniform throughout, except on 2 or 3 trailers where it softens a bit. The only real complaint I can think of is that the clips are sandwiched together very tightly, meaning a new trailer sometimes starts before you realize the previous one has ended. That's not a problem if you're watching the whole disc at one time, but it can be a tad annoying if you're trying to view only specific chapters.If you're into this sort of thing, this is a worthwhile investment. In terms of quality, it's miles above similar complilations available from Cheezy Flicks Entertainment.

This seems like a perfectly logical progression (or is that regression?) for Mellencamp. Since switching labels a few years back (with his self-titled 1998 release), John's band continues to challenge itself. Even with the sparse instrumentation, they have rarely sounded better.Of the dozen songs here, at least half are truly great. I can't stop listening to &quot;John the Revelator.&quot; The lead-off single &quot;Teardrops Will Fall&quot; is the closest thing to to hit song that will probably come from this album...leaving the rest of us to savor John's labor of love.By my count, the man is 52 this year. Trouble No More is ample proof that this great singer/songwriter of our times is still capable of making great music.

Note: This review contains Spoilers. I have to admit, I was a little concerned when the second season began. I mean, having Marshall and Lily break up was kind of a downer. But I'm glad I decided to keep watching, because this year easily contains some of the show's funniest episodes. My wife and I put on "Slap Bet" anytime we need a little pick-me-up. And of course, there's the "Robin Sparkles" episode, in which Cobie Smulders (like the show itself, a criminally-underrated comic actress) really gets a chance to shine. "Swarley" is a Barney Stinson classic. And "Arrivederci, Fiero" may be the biggest laugh-getter of the season.How I Met Your Mother may never quite achieve Classic Sitcom status. And you know, that's really fine with me. I wouldn't want too much success to go to their heads. But I'll keep watching and laughing myself silly.

One of the great things about the modern-day Doctor Who is how, each season, the episodes build off each other to help create truly epic and rewarding finales. This has never been more true than in the 4th season of this fantastic series.This year, the Doctor takes on his third human companion, Donna Noble, who actually appeared in the season 3 premiere. While it's a rocky start for the pair--Donna lacks Rose Tyler's sense of wonder or Martha Jones's intelligent wit--she proves to fill the role admirably. Among their adventures: A meeting with Agatha Christie, a history-bending visit to ancient Pompeii, and the threat of foes both old and new.But (SPOILERS AHEAD) the real treat of season four is the welcome (albiet somewhat brief) return of Billie Piper as Rose Tyler. And not just Rose, but ALL of the Doctor's recent companions, plusTorchwood - The Complete First Season's Capt. Jack and classic WHO companion Sarah Jane Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures - The Complete First Season) are along for the 3-part season finale. I don't think it's a stretch to call the extended finale "Journey's End" the crowning achievement of the Doctor Who revival series.Personally, I think season 1 and 2 are still the best, but the 4th season continues the journey with intelligence, humour and more than a few surprises.

I was disappointed to learn that 2 of the 4 films in this collection were, in fact, half-hour t.v. shows. But if you're a fan of Lon Jr. (and I certainly am), it's kind of nice to have them. "The Golden Junkman" is by far the better of the two, with Chaney evoking sympathy as Greek immigrant. "Lock Up" is a standard prison drama.Chaney fairs somewhat beter in "Manfish," a low-budget but still fairly attractive production, with some great underwater photography. Again, he's a sympathetic character, as opposed to the hulking brutes he often played. And speaking of hulking brutes..."The Indestructible Man"--curiously relegated to "bonus feature" status in this collection--is the real reason to get this disc. The story is familiar to fans of b-movies of the fifites: Chaney's a convict excuted for murder, but brought back to life to seek revenge against those who wronged him. It's one his signature roles, and Lon has a field day with the limited premise. And you can throw out all those bargain-bin copies of The Indestructible Man...this is as clear a version as we'll ever see.If you're really a fan, you'll skip the "Remembering Lon Chaney" segment. Gary Graver, apparently a cinematographer on Al Adamson's "Dracula vs. Frankenstein," spends almost the entire time talking about his old boss (Adamson), and barely even mentions Chaney! No mention is made of any of the films contained in this DVD. The whole thing is complete waste of time, and an insult to Chaney and his fans.Even if you have one of those cheap copies of Indestructible Man, you still need this disc. Beyond that, there's not much to recommend this release.

As a GBS fan living in the southern U.S., I have never had the chance to see the band live, or see any of their videos. Until now. I really couldn't be more satisfied with this DVD. The live show is a lot of fun, and the guys sound great. The videos, while lacking the big-budget polish of more commercially successful bands, are rather charming for that very reason. And the karaoke version of Mari Mac finally sheds some light on some of the more hard-to-understand lyrics that I personally have wondered about for years!Throw in an informative, mostly light-hearted documentary and some home movie footage, and you've got the ultimate Great Big Sea package. If I have one very minor complaint, it's that the menu doesn't offer you the choice of playing all the music videos at once; you have to select each one individually. But it's a small nit to pick when faced with such a delightful compilation of all things Great Big Sea.Order it now, and help spread the word about this terrific band!

Reading all the reviews of Season 3 here, I can't but think that a lot of people take this show way too seriously. When the show debuted, it took heat from fans because it wasn't the same as the admittedly-great animated series of the 90's. Now, even fans who've finally admitted The Batman is a good show are complaining that season 3 isn't on par with 1 and 2.Well, I for one am continuing to enjoy how the creators have redefined Batman & Co. once again. Pairing Barbara Gordon and Pamela Isley--right before destiny changes both their lives in a single night--was just plain cool. And while a handful of new villains can't really match the classic rogues' gallery, who wants to see the same villains over & over? I mean, is it just me, or does Arkham Asylum need to re-think their security system?The Batman continues to impress with its kinetic visual style, and smart (but not too smart) take on a classic character. Lighten up and just have fun.

Like many Star Trek fans, I've been pretty vocal in my objection to paying over $100 for a single season of ANY t.v. show, including Star Trek. Now it seems my patience has paid off, as Paramount has finally reduced the price (on the first 3 seasons so far) to within range of us poor working-class types.As for the show itself, I've never understood why so many people dislike the first season. Sure, there are a few duds, but that is to be expected from virtually any show. Season one adheres closely to Roddenberry's original vision of space exploration, as well as exploring the many facets of the human condition within a science fiction context. I admit, it's not as fun as the original series, or as mature as DS9, but there's still much to recommend these maiden voyages of the Enterprise-D.Hopefully, Paramount will soon make all season of ALL the Trek shows available at this new lower price.

These days, 80's movies are much-maligned. And watching movies like The Slugger's Wife, you gotta admit, a lot of stuff from back then is hard to watch. But I think this one holds up reasonably well. Movies based on Neil Simon plays were popular in the seventies, but were a bit hit-and-miss by 1985 (see also:Brighton Beach Memoirs,Biloxi Blues). Anyway, the prime reason to catch this one--or at least it was the prime reason some two decades ago--is Rebecca DeMornay. Although it would be a stretch call her a great actress, the title role her suits her talents. And yes, that really is her singing (I'm a little ashamed to admit I have the soundtrack on cassette somewhere). As someone else has pointed out, the keyboard-heavy soundtrack does hopelessly date the film.But if you long for a simpler time, when movies wanted nothing more than just ENTERTAIN you for a couple of hours, you could do a lot worse than The Slugger's Wife.

I've always felt. . .I don't know. . .maybe a little guilty about how much I like this show. I mean, to the uninitiated, it would seem to be a girl-power superhero cartoon aimed primarily at young girls.But I'm a 39-year old man. And I love the Powerpuff Girls! Like the best modern animated shows (The Tick Vs. Season One, for example), it manages to combine a kinetic visual style with humor that isn't dumbed-down just because it's a "kid's show." Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup may only be 5 years old, but many of the gags are aimed WAY above their heads. One classic episode (alas, in a later season), "Meet the Beat-alls," is composed almost entirely of references to the Beatles. The girl's chief nemesis, the intelligent simian Mojo Jojo, also seems aimed as much at parents as the kids in the audience.If you think all modern cartoons are too bland, too loud, or too derivative of way-overrated Japanese animation (Teen Titans, I'm looking at YOU), give The Powerpuff Girls a try. It's a rare combination: Smart and funny, with barely a hint of cynicism and crudeness that permeates so much so-called "family" programming.

The War of the Worlds t.v. series came at an interesting time in television history. In 1988, more and more shows were being directly released in syndication, effectively side-stepping the big networks (and thus big network costs). I've read that some people saw this on Saturday afternoons, but my Fox affiliate carried it on Friday nights (the well-known graveyard for good sci-fi).As a huge fan of the original 1953 film, I was delighted that the series paid tribute by incorporating footage of that film into its opening credits, as well as a recurring role for that film's female lead, Ann Robinson as Sylvia Van Buren. The last primetime alien invasion series had been the late, lamented "V." And War of the Worlds owes as much to that series as to its source film and novel.It's universally acknowledged that the first season was far superior to the second, which changed the format and killed off 2 of its stars in its first episode. But the first year was pretty solid, detailing the government-sanctioned battle against alien invaders by a small group of people. Jared Martin as Harrison and Richard Chaves as Ironhorse were standout performers. True, the syndicated format allowed for some occasionally over-the-top effects (similar to Freddy's Nightmares, also syndicated at the same time; and prefigured the X-Files more graphic scares five years later), which I recall being a turn-off to some fans of the original film. But War of the Worlds was an action-packed sci-fi series, and one that deserves another look.

Wow! This is just no comparing this pristine transfer to ANY previously-available format. If you're a fan of black &amp; white movies, you'll appreciate the job Columbia has done with this one. As for the movie, it's somewhat less fanciful than much of Harryhausen's work. A terrific Italian setting, possibly THE best stop-motion creation from the Master (love those mouth movements!), and a lean script make for 83 fun-filled minutes.Note: If you've got the Sinbad movies or some of the other Harryhausen DVD's, you've already got all the extras here. If not, THE HARRYHAUSEN CHRONICLES, hosted by Leonard Nimoy, will be a real treat for you. In fact, I only held back one star in the rating because of the complete lack of new supplemental materials.

Although not as impressive as his later, more popular films, Ray Harryhausen's work on 20 Million Miles to Earth is still marvelous entertainment. And now, here comes a super-deluxe package of not only the film, but a wealth of supplemental material for fans to enjoy.But first, let's get this "colorization" business out of the way. I've never understood some people's disdain for black & white movies. And I think 20 Million looked just fine in its original form. Having said that, it's important to realize that Harryhausen himself participated in the process, so it has his full approval. In fact, in the 20-minute documentary on Disc 2, Harryhausen states he would have made ALL his Columbia pictures of the fifties in color if he'd been given the budget. So, even though I'm a purist at heart, it doesn't really bother me that the film has been colorized. As for the result, the color looks no better or worse than other films of the same era that were filmed in color. And the disc gives you the options of viewing the film in its original black & white.The master himself comes off sharp as a tack in the various interview segments. It's amazing that this man, well into his eighties, has such vivid recollections of films he made over 50 years ago. Director Tim Burton sits down with Harryhausen and shows how much of a fan he (Burton) himself is, asking questions we all would ask if we had the same opportunity. Other filmmakers such as Terry Gilliam and Rick Baker offer their experiences with Ray's films as well. Burton and Gilliam, directors known for their visual styles, point out that the films' still-impressive special effects often overshadowed the limited acting abilities of their stars. Actress Joan Taylor (who starred in 20 Million and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) also has fond memories of the films, and looks great for a woman in her seventies.Rounding out the extra features are a gallery of ad artwork, one of Harryhausen's original sketches, a comic book teaser "20 Million Miles More," and featurettes on the film's music and the colorization process. Curiously, the original theatrical trailer (which was included on Columbia's previous single-disc release) is omitted. In its place are trailer for "Labyrinth" and "The Dark Crystal."I suspect die-hard fans will still be put-off by the colorization idea. However, this 2-disc set has so much more to offer, plus the aforementioned ability to view the film in its original form. It's definitely worth picking up.

Although I bought both these sets at Best Buy when they were released, I'm delighted that folks who may have missed out on them can now own these great films on DVD.To be honest, only a couple of the films might be considered bona-fide sci-fi classics, which occasionally rise above the limitations of typcial fifties "B" movie material. THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is one the most thought-provoking and existential films from the period. And THE MONOLITH MONSTERS rises above its low budget with some simple yet impressive effects, and better-than-average performances.TARANTULA and THE DEADLY MANTIS are entertaining parts of the wave of Giant Killer Bug movies that ruled the screens in the 1950's. MANTIS sports one of the more ridiculously memorable critters of the era. CULT OF THE COBRA and THE LAND UNKNOWN incorporate the then-popular sub-genre of "jungle thrills" into their scripts.The real oddity of this collection is DR. CYLCOPS. It's the only film here made in color, and was actually made in the forties. But the miniaturization effects are first-rate, and are every bit on-par with those of SHRINKING MAN, made some 15 years later.Rounding out the collection are THE MOLE PEOPLE, THE LEECH WOMAN, and MONSTER ON THE CAMPUS. . .all fine examples of drive-in shocks on a limited budget. I personally find these three to be the least of the bunch, but there's really not a bad film in the whole collection.The only extras here are theatrical trailers for most of the films, leading to my only minor complaint: The trailer for SHRINKING MAN is not the famous one narrated by Orson Wells, but a short teaser which really reveals nothing of the film itself. I've seen the Wells trailer on t.v. many times over the years, so I would think Universal could have gotten their hands on it. But like I said, it's a minor quibble from an admitted Serious Sci-Fi Geek.And hey, even if you're NOT a Serious Sci-Fi Geek, this impressive set may just convert you.

Flight to Mars gets off to a decent start, by 50's sci-fi movie standards, as a group of guys and the token gal set off for an ambitious exploration of the Red Planet. But once they arrive, they are greeted by very human Martians (wearing space helmets...can they not breathe their OWN air??). While the Martians offer to help the earthlings repair their rocketship, they are actually plotting to use the ship to launch an attack on Earth.If you're looking for low-budget but still effective interstellar thrills, you probably won't find much here (see Invaders From Mars, Forbidden Planet, etc.). Admittedly, not much was known about real space travel in 1951, but much of the dialogue hopelessly dates Flight to Mars (Favorite bit: The Earth gal, upon seeing how the Martians live, asks a Martian female to take her to the kitchen). Yes, there is a certain appeal to the Martian women's costumes, some of which are so short I'm surprised they got past the censors. And there are a couple of mildly impressive sets. But really, the overall story moves at a snail's pace and the acting is mostly just tolerable.As someone has already stated, the print quality here leaves a bit to be desired. Some scratches and color changes are to be expected from a film that's over 50 years old, but there are also numerous missing frames that usually result a in jarring break in the dialogue. Most annoying is a red spot just off-center of the picture which appears to be a spot burned into the print itself.If you're fan of these type of films, you'll probably want this in your collection, despite its many flaws.

You know, I really had no problem with Lois and Clark getting together. This started with the season 3 premiere, and, like the overall series itself, was handled with a light touch. But after waiting for the wedding (and being led on by the regrettable "on again/off again" story arc in the previous season), the Big Moment was really a letdown. I won't spoil the details for those who haven't seen it, but I think only the most undemanding of fans will be satisfied by the route the writers take.The rest of Season 4 is decidedly hit and miss. Howie Mandel makes for a fun Myxzptlk, sending Metropolis into an eerie time loop at Christmastime. And the resolution to last season's Kryptonian story arc is a treat, as super-powered villains lay waste to Smallville. On the downside, other guest-stars like Grant Shaud and Harry Anderson are wasted in dumb roles. Even return visits by Tempus only serve to remind one of how much fun the character was in the beginning.As usual, Cain and Hatcher do their best; indeed, it's their chemistry that makes even the lesser episodes (and there are many) bearable. Still, I can't help but wonder: If the writers had been allowed to keep them apart (romantically speaking) awhile longer, would the show have been able to keep the magic the made the first 2 seasons so much fun?

It's a commonly-held maxim in the world of videogaming: Games based on movies are either really, really bad, or really, really good. This one definitely belongs to the latter category. As a serious old-school gamer (as in, 2-D is all the dimensions I ever need, and one-dimensional platformers have served me very well, thank you), I expected to not like the game very much. But I was pleasantly surprised--most of the time--by the intuitive controls and fairly uncomplicated button combos.Although the dialogue can at times be repetitive, there is something reassuring about Tobey Maguire's almost constant speech. The one-liners are classic comic-book stuff, and Willem Dafoe is wonderful, reprising his Green Goblin role from the film.Best Stuff: (1) The aerial combat, which takes a little getting used to, but is very fun and rewarding. (2) The very-immersive storyline, which nicely expands on the movie. (3) Spiderman's abilities are varied and great fun!Not-So-Great: (1) Some indoor areas are far too dark. (2) Some of the levels are way too short.All in all, a very good game, a must-have for fans of the movie and comics.

I was only 9 when this originally aired, but I remember liking it, so I wondered how it would hold up. I was pleasantly suprised to find "Tabitha" is really quite enjoyable. "Bewitched" has been put on such a lofty perch over the years (and deservedly so), that any spin-off would have a lot to live up to. The show is clearly inspired by its predecessor, and I had no problem accepting Lisa Hartman as the daughter of Elizabeth Montgomery's character. Yes, the producers did re-write history by making Adam the older, mortal brother of Tabitha. But the Bewitched formula is still in place: Adam tries to keep his witchy sis from doing magic, but of course she does it quite often.Sony has done a fine job of restoring the show, better than one might expect from a decidely minor 30+ year old show that only lasted 12 episodes. Tabitha will probably never be more than a footnote to a beloved classic sitcom, but it's worth picking up (and at a bargain price as of this writing) if you like Bewitched.

Here's a mostly-forgotten bit of monster fun from Hanna Barbera, circa 1980. The Drak Pack centers on three teenage descendants of the legendary Dracula, Wolfman, and the Frankenstein monster. Instead of perpetuating the monsterous mythos of their ancestors, these guys are trying to do some good. Leading the pack is the "Big D" himself. Their comically-inept adversaries comprise the group O.G.R.E. (Organization for Generally Rotten Enterprises).Mix Scooby Doo and The Groovie Goolies and, well, you'd probably still come up with something a bit more fun and engaging than The Drak Pack. Still, it's good clean fun, especially for monster fans. As is typical of HB animated releases, the video and audio presentation are more than adequate, if unremarkable. There are no special features in the 3-disc set.Recommended mostly for nostalgia purposes; I imagine modern kids will find the humor and action rather bland.

First of all, I'm not one these people here who hate country music, and think it's all a bunch of redneck garbage. There's PLENTY of first-rate modern country out there: Look at the latest releases by Sara Evans, Billy Currington, Pat Green, George Strait. And Toby Keith USED to make adequate, if often uninspired, music.But I really think he's been coasting since becoming the redneck poster boy with his so-called patriotic songs a few years back. Just look at the first two singles off WHITE TRASH: Get Drunk and Be Somebody is a complete mess, with some of his worst vocals ever (and that's really saying something...if even you embrace Keith's simple, stupid philosophy, you're insane if you think he's a great vocalist). And then there's A Little Too Late. What is this, country DISCO?? It's unlistenable.I can't even give him 2 stars for trying something different, when what he's trying sounds so bad. I can only conclude that the people that are turning this white trash in to Top 10 hits are being somehow subliminally brainwashed by the music. Thank God I seem to be immune.

I was 14 when a friend introduced me to S.E. Hinton's classic novel. A year later, we were overjoyed to learn the book was being made into a film. And we enjoyed the film, for the most part. But, like so many others have said, we also knew that much of the book didn't make it to the screen. So I am especially thrilled to find this new release with several restored scenes. The major additions are at the beginning and end (a full 10 minutes of new material unfolds in the beginning, before the theatrical version even begins). The other minor additions mostly occur during the middle section, while Ponyboy and Johnny are hiding out at the church.The cast & director commentaries are quite enjoyable. Coppola defends his decision to alter the film's soundtrack, but anyone who's seen the new version will likely disagree. Replacing Carmine Coppola's orchestral score with surf music and about a half dozen Elvis songs (which are historically as well as dramatically out of place) is a jarring experience for anyone familiar with the film.If you can overlook the soundtrack changes, this is certainly a marked improvement over the theatrical version of the film. Now, if someone would just edit the original score back into this version, THE OUTSIDERS would be the film we've always wanted.

First off, I'm delighted that Image is releasing many of its genre titles from the &quot;Wade Williams Collection&quot; in very affordable 2-packs. I've said it before, but here it comes again...it's just a GREAT time to be a fan of 50's sci-fi flicks.Now, on to the films. KRONOS is easily the better of the two, and is presented in widescreen &quot;Regalscope.&quot; This is a good thing, because there are a number of long shots of the Kronos machine stomping across the countryside. The plot is typical of the drive-in fare of the period: Scientists come together to stop a menace from outer space; in this case, it's a giant energy-sucking robot. Also typical of the era, it's more Fiction than Science, but it's great for what it is.SPACEWAYS has the distinction of being the first sci-fi film produced by England's Hammer Studios, far better known for their horror output beginning in the latter part of the decade. It's essentially a murder-mystery, with a generous dose of space trappings to make it science fiction. Wooden acting and cheap effects abound, making this a fairly tedious affair. But for science fiction completists, or fans of Hammer director Terence Fisher, it's worth a look.In short, KRONOS is a minor classic; SPACEWAYS is a curiosity of interest only to hardcore 50's sci-fi buffs.

Well, it's nice of the folks at Image to re-release a lot of its genre films in these very affordable 2-packs. If you don't already own either of these films, it's a good deal. If you already have TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, don't bother with this...because TEENAGE MONSTER is simply awful, even by "bad movies" standards.But let's take the good first. TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE is one of those rare drive-in sci-fi flicks that thrives on its low budget and wooden cast. A space-faring bunch of alien teens plots to take over the earth, but one of them falls for an earth gal. There's plenty of surprisingly effective ray-gun action and campy dialogue along the way. If you know the film's reputation, you might enjoy analyzing all the reportedly homosexual subtext that openly-gay director Tom Graff threw in. Really, if you like this kind of film, you could do much worse.Like, you could willingly give away 65 minutes of your life to TEENAGE MONSTER. The movie starts off promisingly enough--in an Ed Wood sort of way--as a sparkler on a wire stands in for a meteor crashing to earth, exposing a kid to radiation and killing his father. Seven years later, that kid is like a 50 year old man with a Grizzly Addams beard who grunts and kills people. Oh, there's an attempt at a plot involving his protective mother and a blackmailing local woman...but trust me, you won't care.It's a shame to see talented folks like the lovely Anne Gwynne and one of the final makeup jobs by the legendary Jack Pierce wasted in this mess.Recommended ONLY for Teenagers From Outer Space.

Like him or not, there's no denying the power of William Shatner. Busier than ever at age 80, the former Captain James T. Kirk periodically continues his philosopic exploration of the Star Trek phenomenon. Indeed, this is not the first video release in which Shatner delves deep into his most famous character (see alsoMind Meld - Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime). But with "The Captains," he brings along 4 other iconic actors from the franchise and engages them some candid conversations.As a longtime Star Trek fan, I always approach interview segments with the actors with a slight amount of trepidation. The fact is, some of them have a tendency to repeat the same stories over and over. Anyone who's ever sat through Nichelle Nichols' old chestnut of a story about how Martin Luther King Jr. talked her into not leaving the original series knows what I'm talking about. Happily, this is mostly not the case with this documentary. I only heard one story, from Patrick Stewart, that he used two years previously for the "Captain's Summit" Blu-ray disc. The interviews with Kate Mulgrew and Scott Bakula are especially enlightening, although Mulgrew comes across far more pessimistic than the always-affable "Enterprise" star. The film also puts Shatner face-to-face with the NEW Kirk, Chris Pine. Although their time together is limited, credit must be given to Pine for not engaging in anything resembling hero-worship, while Shatner shows some rare restraint by keeping his own ego in check.Ever the armchair psychologist, Shatner isn't afraid to ask the big questions. Bakula admits that Quantum Leap's strenuous schedule helped end his marriage; an almost-tearful Stewart confides that he always placed his career above family obligations, even at the expense of two wives. Mulgrew speaks of the pressures of being a single mother while working 12+ hour days on the set of "Star Trek Voyager."And then there's Avery Brooks ("Deep Space Nine"'s Capt. Sisko). What to make of his extended odes to the rapturous wonders of jazz music (Brooks even non-answers several questions by tickling the ivories)? Although his show remains the franchise's dark horse, Brooks himself is probably Shatner's heir apparent by virtue of his bug-eyed metaphysical countenance. Seriously, there's nothing inTrekkiesto rival the unbridled weirdness of Brooks' interview segments."The Captains," even with a few flaws, ultimately represents a true time capsule for anyone in the future who might wonder just what all the fuss was about those "Star Trek" shows and movies. As he did in "Mind Meld," William Shatner sees Death coming for him...sooner rather than later. And while this morbid tone may not sit easily with some viewers interested in light entertainment, I can't help but feel the whole experience was very therapeutic and even comforting to its maker. As he is quick to point out, William Shatner has been entertaining audiences for over 50 years. "When I die...if people say, 'He was Captain Kirk," I'm O.K. with that," Shatner tell Patrick Stewart. And if the end is truly drawing near, this labor of love is a fine tribute to a group of people and a Canadian actor to whom they owe no small measure of their success.

I continue to be impressed and amazed by these Walt Disney Treasures. For fans of early animation, they are indeed a treasure trove of rare material. More casual Disney fans, including those who prefer modern computer-assisted animation, will likely not appreciate the cartoons here.And while I'm certainly a fan of the early stuff, the fact is that many of the cartoons here don't measure up to the cartoons in Vol. 1 of the Silly Symphonies series. The always-informative Leonard Maltin explains that this was still an experimental phase for the Disney animators, that they were honing their craft in preparation for their first feature-length animated film. And that's fine, and it does import a certain historical significance to these short films. But many of them are...well, for lack of a better word...pretty dull. There's just so much cute, singing and dancing animal antics a person can take in one sitting. Oh, there are exceptions, of course. THREE ORPHAN KITTENS, OLD KING COLE, MOTHER GOOSE GOES HOLLYWOOD and BROKEN TOYS all offer something a little different. And no matter how big a Disney fan you might be, nothing can compare you for the bizarre 1929 short HELL'S BELLS: Imagine, if you will, the name which would become synonymous with Family Entertainment for generations actually made a 7-minute musical cartoon set entirely in hell!For the completist, this is certainly a must-buy. And most classic animation fans will find enough of value here to make this set worth owning. But as a huge fan myself, and one who owns most of the other Walt Disney Treasures, I don't feel like this is one I will re-watch very often.

There's plenty of reviews here happily reporting "my kids/grandkids love these." So here's an opinion from an adult who grew up on the classic Tom & Jerry shorts of the 1940's and 50's. I was really concerned that these new cartoons would bear no resemblance to the older ones. After all, modern-day incarnations of Looney Tunes, Scooby Doo, Popeye, and many others are hard for us classic animation fans to watch. But I'm happy to report that Tom & Jerry Tales actually retains the spirit of the original Hannah-Barbera shorts. Sure, the animation has a slightly more contemporary look, with regard to shading of the characters. But it's not nearly as grating as the three-dimensional effects most hand-drawn animation goes for these days. Most importantly, the action and sense of fun are still there. I wasn't surprised to find the violence toned down a bit (unlike the original theatrical shorts, these cartoons ARE aimed at children), but poor ol' Tom still gets pounded with regularity.We adults who still enjoy cartoons are fortunate that so many Golden Age shorts are now available. But if you're itching to try something new that honors the cartoons you grew up with, give this one a try. I know I'll be buying the rest of the volumes in this series. No, they'll never replace the Tom & Jerry of the Good Ol' Days. . .but these well-made cartoons are the closest we'll ever come to seeing animation like that again.

Graffiti Bridge was largely ignored on its release in the fall of 1990. And it's not hard to see why: It's horribly edited, rather horribly acted, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Even die-hard Prince fans--myself among them--had a hard time supporting this one.The main problem is probably that Warner Bros. wanted a sequel to the mega-hit Purple Rain. Prince apparently didn't want to make a sequel, but a fifties-style true musical. Unfortunately, a linear sequel to Purple Rain and a fifties-style musical just can't co-exist in the same film. Sure, it's got Prince as the Kid, Morris Day & Co., and a handful of references to the previous film. But people break into song whether or not they're on stage, and (in the aforementioned horrible editing) the sounds don't always match the performers' movements. The worst example of this is in Clinton's Club, when funky ol' George Clinton is singing "We Can Funk"...the song is a duet with Prince on the soundtrack album, and you can HEAR Prince singing in the scene, but he's nowhere to be found. And speaking of the soundtrack, some of the best cuts on the disc (released a good 6 months prior to the film's release) don't even appear in the film.So why do I even give it a generous 3 stars? Well, I guess the thing kind of grows on ya after awhile. It's all pretty lightweight stuff, despite Prince's patented pseudo-Christian imagery. And the music that did make the cut is quite good, though Purple Rain fanatics will balk at the "new jack" sound that was all the rage in 1990.In short, this isn't going to win Prince any new fans. But for those of us who still believe the Purple Wonder is about the best thing out there, Graffiti Bridge is a playful little curiosity that, in the end, really isn't so bad.Oh, and it's nice to have the 4 music videos, especially a rare live version of "The Question of U."

I've had this excellent book for several years, and I still go back to it at least once a month to look something up. There is simply no more complete reference guide to science fiction films available. Think you know science fiction cinema? Prepare to be humbled by the sheer volume of this book. I especially appreciate the reviews of the early, silent films, many of which we will probably never get to see.Some of the reviews are better thought-out than others. And you may occasionally marvel at how a film you were sure was an all-time classic only gets a mediocre review. But these are minor quibbles for an otherwise excellent volume.If you're a fan of sci-fi films, you absolutely MUST own this book. Yes, it's pricey, but it also might be the last film reference book you will ever need.

The most impressive part about this game to me is how well EA captured the feel of a Bond film. Everything or Nothing could almost be a &quot;lost&quot; 007 adventure. After a brief prologue (in which you're thrown right into the action with precious little assistance), you're treated to a traditional Bond credit sequence, complete with a very decent little pop number by Mya. Then, after a holographic training session, the real action begins.The story contains several elements Bond fans will recognize. We have that old favorite baddie, Jaws; an underwater fortress right out of Spy Who Loved Me; a villain with ties to Max Zorin (A View to a Kill) and so on. And if you've been disappointed by the driving sequences in previous 007 games, you'll find that EA has improved upon those. The motorcycle and helicopter scenes are excellent.Favorite new move: As you're rappeling up or down a wall, you can make Bond turn around and fire at pursuers. Shoot one, and he's left dangling on his own cord.So why 4 stars instead of 5? Well, some of the levels are just too short. Some are too hard. And the mulitplayer option just isn't as much fun as it has been in other games (my all-time fave is probably the one in The World Is Not Enough for N64).But if you've enjoyed the other games in this series, or you're even a casual fan of the movies, you probably will agree that this is the best Bond game since Goldeneye.

I'm sure most everyone reading this remembers those great Hanna Barbera cartons of the 60's and 70's. Looking at them now, I think most of them hold up pretty well. The animation wasn't exactly groundbreaking, and hasn't really aged well. But as a kid, we didn't care about stuff like that. HB's Saturday morning lineup was full of colorful, FUN cartoons with excellent voice work.Wheelie and the Chopper bunch never got the respect of the other talking-car series,Speed Buggy, but it's still a good cartoon. I only wish it had lasted longer; the complete series is only comprised of 13 episodes (although, technically, there are 3 shorts per episode so you get a total of 39 separate stories).As with other recent Warner "manufactured on demand" titles, the quality is very good. Even without digital remastering, the drawings are sharp and the colors are bright. Some behind-the-scenes features would have been appreciated, but sadly there is nothing like that here. The studio is clearly aiming for adult collectors with these somewhat high-priced nostalgic titles; surely they must realize we grown-up kids would like some bonus material. But if you have fond memories of Wheelie, Chopper and the gang, you really will want to add this to your collection.

As others have observed, the author does appear to be a living encyclopedia on the subject of the spinach-loving sailor. The book is, for the most part, exhaustively researched and leaves nary a stone unturned. There are, however, a few of reasons I have rated it 4 instead of 5 stars.First of all, while no one could reasonably argue Mr. Grandinetti is a Popeye expert, he's hardly an expert writer. His casual writing style unfortunately results in some haphazard organization. An experienced editor would prove invaluable here. Specifically, he's given to going off on tangents while discussing a particular topic. To be fair, such tangents usually are relevant; they simply struck this reader as jarring interruptions to the narrative flow.The author also inserts quite a bit of opinion in with his facts. This often takes the form of "Popeye fans around the world feel that. . ." While many would probably argue that being co-founder of the International Popeye Fan Club means Mr. Grandinetti CAN speak for many, I again found this style of writing distracting.Last and least, for the price tag on this baby, I think some color pictures could have been printed. The black and white ones are many and varied, the majority of them quite rare, so this is a minor gripe.OK, enough complaining. On the plus side, I greatly appreciate having a detailed listing of all the Popeye cartoons from the 30's to the 90's. And while the majority of folks know the character more from the cartoons than E.C. Segar's comic strip, it's gratifying to see a large portion devoted to Popeye's humble ink & paper origins. Certainly, this book was a labor of love. And while I stand by my criticisms listed above, I do feel that this is an essential book for Popeye enthusiasts.

As I stated in my review forEl Vampiro (The Vampire) & El Ataud del Vampiro (The Vampire's Coffin) - 2 Disc Special Edition, I'm a newcomer to these Mexican horror films of the 50's and 60's. I'm happy to report that The Black Pit of Dr. M is another great find, although not quite as good as El Vampiro.Once again, I found myself pleasantly surprised at the utter lack of campiness, so often associated with films of this type. Indeed, the film's concern with the Great Mystery--life after death--is handled quite seriously. I don't want to give away too much, because the story has one or two great shocks that should not be ruined. But the basic plot involves two doctors in an insane asylum who make a strange pact: Whoever dies first will attempt to come back to the world of the living to tell the other about the afterlife. When the surviving one, Dr. Masali, attempts to bridge the gap between this life and the next, things don't exactly go as planned. His unexpected fate makes for the film's most memorable scene, a chilling exercise in gothic horror.The Black Pit of Dr. M is presented in Spanish, with optional English subtitles. Unlike other Casa Negra films, there is no English-dubbed version. A very informative commentary track from video expert/musician Frank Coleman explains that the dubbed version of the film apparently no longer exists. Coleman also offers detailed biographies of the principal cast, as well as his own memories of growing up in the sixties and being exposed to these films, primarily through Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine. That was a little before my time, but I imagine anyone who grew up during that period will readily identify with Coleman's stories. There is also a rock music video from his band, 21st Century Art, set to scenes from the film. My only real complaint with the generous set of extras is that the print in the 2 text essays is too small. I have a 27 inch t.v., and I had to strain to read them. If you have anything smaller than that, I doubt you'll be able to make out the words. A Spanish trailer of the film and a colorful Casa Negra Loteria game card round out the supplemental material.If, like me, you're just starting to discover Mexican horror films, The Black Pit of Dr. M appears to be another fine example. Like the best of Britain's Hammer Studios films of the period, these filmmakers made the most out of limited resources, and produced atmospheric chillers that I believe fans of classic horror will appreciate.

I passed on this one in the theaters, but after hearing and reading so many positive reviews, I bought the DVD sight unseen. And I've actually been kicking myself for not seeing it on the big screen. Enchanted is a perfectly delightful fairy tale. And while there are some cliches (the fish-out-of-water thing, mostly), the movie's success hinges almost solely on the pitch-perfect performance of Amy Adams as the princess Giselle.Also refreshing is an almost complete lack of modern cynicism that affects so many movies, even other "family" fare. This is best given voice by a character who comments on Prince Edward's (a brilliant comic turn by James Marsden) profession of true love for Giselle: "You say that without a touch of irony."There's a handful of song-and-dance numbers that are a joy to watch. There's the obligatory CGI animal sidekick, Pip the chipmunk. And there's Susan Saradon's scene-chewing evil queen. And amidst all the fun and laughter, there are many references/inside jokes to the Disney's rich history of animated films. But even if you don't catch them all--and I'm sure I missed a few--you'll still have a great time watching this one. In fact, I can't wait to watch it again. When's the last time you watched a movie and immediatly wanted to go back and watch it again?HIGHLY recommended for movie lovers of ALL ages.

Sure, any respectable Prince fan has all the songs on Disc 1 (and many of us, myself included, have all the remixes on vinyl). But this is still a better single disc compilation than "The Very Best of Prince" from a few years back, and I'm delighted to have good CD copies of the remixes.There are plenty of Prince fans who would say you shouldn't judge his amazing body of work by a selection of 17 singles (3 or 4 of which, despite their inclusion here, were NOT exactly hits). And they're certainly right. But it's a great jumping-off point for the uninitiated, and a reminder to "classic Prince" fans of how effortessly he used to produce great songs.The best thing about this compilation is the fact that, amazingly, most of the remixes are BETTER than the original versions. Which is why you won't find the original radio mixes of Little Red Corvette, Kiss, Let's Go Crazy, and a few others on Disc 1. Let's Go Crazy, though hardly a rare track, is the version heard in the Purple Rain movie. And Thieves in the Temple is not so much a remix, but a perfectly realized extension of one of Prince's most underrated tracks. The same can be said for the long versions of Let's Work and U Got the Look.It's not perfect, to be sure (I can easily think of a dozen singles I would trade for "Money Don't Matter 2 Night"). But hey, we can always hope for "Ultimate Prince Vol. 2." There's enough material--both hit songs and extended mixes--out there to warrant probably TWO more of these things. But it will never happen if people keep complaining about getting ripped off. It's a great sampling of music from a modern musical genius. . .plus 11 hard-to-get remixes. So quit whining and pick this one up!

In the long-standing tradition of direct-to-video sequels, ARIEL'S BEGINNING continues the story of a beloved character without really adding anything new. The music is OK, but doesn't come close to the brilliant exuberance of the original (it's telling that the most inspired musical number, "Jump in the Line," was NOT written for the movie). Likewise, the animation is well-done, but pales in comparison to the theatrically-released original.Still, young children may find enough to like about the antics of Ariel and her sisters. As sequels go, it nowhere near as awful asThe Hunchback of Notre Dame II, but falls short of even the studio's less-celebrated theatrical releases likeHome on the Range.A brief behind-the-scenes peak at Broadway's "The Little Mermaid", a couple of deleted scenes, a profile of the film's director, and the requisite DVD game round out the bonus features.If you're a completist, or have young children who love The Little Mermaid, this is not a bad addition to your Disney DVD collection.

In a seemingly endless sea of remakes which quickly (and rightfully) sink into oblivion, Bewitched deserves credit for at least putting a new spin on the formula. I can't imagine anyone but Nicole Kidman in the role of Isabel...she simply glows, you can't take your eyes off her. Will Ferrell delivers his usual goofy, over-the-top performance, which suits his character just fine. And at the heart of it all is a sweet and (mostly) old-fashioned love story. It also pays due reverence to its source, as Isabel keeps a picture of Elizabeth Montgomery in her dressing room, and wonders what the "real" Samantha would do. Sure, it's not perfect. In fact (minor spoiler alert!), I knocked off a whole star for the whole "Uncle Arthur" nonesense in the final act. But I laughed. A lot, in fact. I was delighted with Kidman's performance. And I left the film feeling pretty darn good. What more could you want?For once, don't believe what the majority of critics have said. Bewitched is a great romantic comedy.

From the very first number--the title track--I had a sinking feeling I'd heard it all before. And I had: the song "3121" is a mix of two 90's Prince songs, "319" and "Come." What follows is a mix of admittedly cohesive, yet hopelessly derivative, songs. As he did throughout the nineties (when he wasn't singing about --*yawn*--artists' rights), Prince spends an inordinate amount of time trying to justify himself. In the throwaway pop number "Lolita", he offers this tired recommendation to the title character: "You're much too young to peep my stash/You're writing checks yo body can't cash." The same can be said for the 2nd single "Black Sweat." A funky percussive beat over horny lyrics...not exactly breaking new ground there (and I know this is trifling, but is a "Black Sweat" more, uh, sweaty than a regular one?). The same lyrical limpness plagues "Love", an otherwise well-intentioned tune which, with its layered keyboards, sounds very much like vintage Prince. Yet even with his well-known knack for experimentation, hearing Prince's voice through a vocoder ("Incense and Candles") was a jarring experience. Ironically, the lovely seduction number "Satisfied" is the shortest song on the album [insert Viagra joke].The disc's latter half is decidely more spiritual, for the most part. I read on the npg website that the duet with Tamar is available on her album, so I don't think it was necessary to include it here. The closing number "Get on the Boat", a brassy, funky plea for harmony successfully bookends the album by recounting the "Don't you want to come?" line from the opening number.Prince's detractors having been saying for years that he's tired. And even the faithful had begun to question him at the start of the new millenium, with the unlistenable "Rainbow Children" album. "Musicology" restored our faith, but this latest offering feels, more than anything, like a batch of songs from Prince's well-known "vault". . .and most of them probably should have stayed there.

I'm surprised by the less-than-enthusiastic reviews for this show. All this stuff about the show not being realistic just shows how much we NEED more shows like this. What do I mean by that? SECRET LIFE was created by the same people behind SEVENTH HEAVEN, another series strongly rooted in Christian values that was attacked for that very reason.Which is not to say that all the show's characters have strong faiths. Not at all. But what bugs me is that when teens are depicted as--gasp!--having values and NOT constantly rebelling against their parents, people see that as unrealistic. Kids today are already raised by t.v., movies and music; so what's wrong with giving them something positive to watch?All in all, a very engaging, thought-provoking show that families can watch together.

As a child of the 70's, I was allowed to watch SOAP, probably because much of the adult humour was over my head. And yes, it is pretty tame by today's standards, but so what? It's still freakin' hilarious! Check out the mind-boggling array of talent this landmark series cultivated:Billy Crystal: OK, he ain't been funny for awhile, but he's probably the biggest star to come out of the show.Richard Mulligan: Make that...the late, lamented Richard Mulligan. His Burt Campbell could make you laugh yourself silly one minute, and break your heart in the next. Admit it, SOAP fans...you hung onto "Empty Nest" far too long just because of him.Kathryn Helmond: If you grew up on "Who's the Boss" you know her as Mona. But to my generation, she was the sweet and ditzy heart of this crazy ensemble.Robert Guillome: I don't think I spelled his name right. He's Benson, of course.Ted Wass: I never was a BLOSSOM fan (really...who was?), but in terms of success, Ted was on a hit show for awhile there.Dinah Manoff: Hmmm...Empty Nest again?And there are other familiar faces, of course. SOAP is a one-of-a-kind sitcom, that's for sure.Now, let's just hope for some extra features when seasons 2-4 hit the shelves.

Something Weird Video scores another mini-triumph (after Monsters Crash the Pajama Party) with this rare and strange collection. If you're a fan of Boris Karloff, there's no question you must have this 2-disc set. Karloff is not only the host, but appears in most of the episodes. Comparisons to The Twilight Zone are inevitable; but the tone of the show more closely resembles Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The quality of the scripts and acting varies wildly, making the series a mixed bag. On the technical side, the picture looks crisp and clean, and the audio is acceptable for a mono recording. A special bonus: 2 episodes of the equally obscure 13 DEMON STREET, hosted by a haggard Lon Chaney Jr. Personally, I hope SWV will go ahead and release the full Chaney series. Overally, an impressive presentation of a Lost Not-Quite-Classic.

Although I consider myself quite the cartoon afficiando, I admit I knew very little about Harveytoons. Like most people, I remember Casper, and had a passing familiarity with Baby Huey, but that's about it. So I was delighted to find this set, as I had seen almost none of these 'toons before.Harveytoons may not have had the polish of Disney, or the go-for-broke antics of the best Looney Tunes, but the shorts here are pretty well-done. And parents can rejoice...there's nothing remotely offensive in these colorful, kid-friendly cartoons.Now, the DVD's themselves are another story. I don't like the fact that I can't select individual cartoons. They are grouped by episodes, with each one having a theme. Also, the "Toon Take" short that end each episodes appear to be edited versions of longer cartoons. Somebody please tell me if I'm wrong about that, but I'm sure something is missing. Likewise, there are no credits for the individual shorts, just a title card.Children and parents who watch these with their kids probably won't care too much about my minor complaints. And like I said, the cartoons themselves are quite entertaining. I just want everyone to understand up front what they're getting.

Like other reviewers here, I was raised on the classic Universal monsters, as well as the more colorful offerings of Hammer Films from the 50's to the 70's. So it was with great delight I discovered this pair of Mexican horror films.El Vampiro was clearly inspired by Universal's Dracula, although it is in almost every way a superior production. German Robles as Count Luvad is quite a commanding figure, and compares favorably with Christopher Lee in Hammer's HORROR OF DRACULA (released the year after El Vampiro). The film is set primarily in a crumbling hacienda, effectively punctuated with swirling mists and cobwebs. Throw in an eerie and occasionally surprising music score and some primitive but effective special effects, and you've got a real winner.El Ataud Del Vampiro (The Vampire's Coffin), released the following year, picks up where its predecessor ended. Most of the cast and crew returned, as the resurrected Luvad stalks the first film's heroine (the lovely Ariadne Welter), intent on making her his bride. Producer Abel Salazar encores as the nominal leading man, Dr. Enrique. Although most viewers seem to feel the film is not nearly as good as El Vampiro, I have to disagree. The finale in a theatre, in which Luvad frustrates Enrique by constantly changing form, is particularly exciting.In addition to pristine prints of the two films, there is an informative if amaterish audio commentary on El Vampiro by author Robert Cotter. Both films offer a choice of original Spanish language (with optional English subtitles) or English dubbing. The Spanish track is far superior, as the English dubbing is not only often inaccurate, but spoils the suspension of disbelief necessary to this type of film. There are also extensive promotional materials, and a colorful "Casa Negra Loteria Game Card."I admit, this was my first Casa Negra DVD, and my first real exposure to Mexican horror cinema. I can hardly wait to discover other such treasures! Meanwhile, THE VAMPIRE COLLECTION is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys atmospheric horror.

As a child of the seventies, I have great memories of this and many other Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoons. Viewing them now at age 43, I still enjoy them, although many years of exposure to so much animation has perhaps made me a bit more jaded.As you may know, HB were pioneers of the art of "limited animation," which came about in the late 50's and early 60's. A simple description of limited animation is that the characters don't move nearly as much as, say, those of the Looney Tunes of the Golden Age from the late 1930's thru the 1950's. It's a time-saving and money-saving technique that worked well for animated shows made for the demanding schedules of weekly television.Anyway, there were still many colorful and funny cartoons made using this technique. And thankfully, Speed Buggy is one of them. Like many other HB cartoons of the seventies (Goober And The Ghost Chasers,Josie and the Pussycats - The Complete Series, etc.), Speed Buggy follows the comic adventures of a group of young people as they get involved in various mysteries or tangle with madcap villains. It's all done with a sense of innocent fun, with the Mel Blanc-voiced lovable title character front and center.Like other recent cartoon releases from Warner Bros., Speed Buggy is "made on demand" using DVD-R discs. This is my second such purchase (afterHerculoids: The Complete Series), and I'm happy to report that the series looks and sounds great. There are, however, no extra features of any kind. No alternate-language tracks or subtitles, just a menu allowing you to select episodes or "Play All." And as much as I still enjoy the cartoons, I just can't justify a perfect score for a bare-bones release. Hopefully, WB is seeing that there is still a market for classic animation, and will start putting a little more effort into these releases. However, if you have fond memories of Speed Buggy, or want to introduce your children or grandchildren to the show, this is definitely worth adding to your collection.

For the uninitiated, the films of Jean Rollin can be hard to explain (and sometimes, even harder to defend). The Iron Rose was the 3rd in a series of borderline horror/erotica films the director made in the 70's. For those looking for cheap thrills, this probably isn't the Rollin film you want. Unlike the "lesbian vampire" sub-genre Rollin help to perpetuate with films likeShiver of the Vampires [Blu-ray] andLips of Blood [Blu-ray], The Iron Rose is actually fairly restrained.It's a fairly simple story of a young couple who get locked in a cemetary at night, and the rapid disintegration of their relationship and sanity. The girl (neither character is given a name in the film) is affected the most, as she begins to embrace the death and decay surrounding them, to the point of even talking to corpses beneath their feet. In the wrong hands, such scenes might have decended into camp, but Rollin gets a bravura performance out of Francoise Pascal. She takes the girl from kittenish flirt to screaming lunatic in a matter of minutes.As with most any foreign "art" film, one can look for something beneath the surface if one enjoys that type of celluloid psychoanalysis. The girl, for example, may be taking on her shocking new hobby out of disappointment in her would-be lover (who unfortunately resembles the French love child of Rob Lowe and Eric McCormack). If that sounds far-fetched, consider this exchange early in the film: As the pair settle in for a picnic beside a tombstone, the boy accidentally knocks over an iron cross marker. As he's replacing it, the girl comments "Is doesn't seem very hard." "Hang on, I'll stick it back in," he replies. Hello...paging Dr. Freud!Even putting aside the search for meaning in a 40 year-old French exploitation film, it's not hard to appreciate the gorgeous cinematography. This was my first time viewing the film, so I can't compare the transfer to any prior release, but the colors are quite vivid. Even the numerous nighttime scenes--often a place where HD transfers falter--are clear enough without seeming articially lit. Shots are composed for maximum beauty, such as the famous beach scene, where the girl imagines covorting nude with the titular iron rose in-hand. Like other auteurs such as Hitchcock or Argento, Jean Rollin seems to believe in the power of what Hitch called "pure cinema." The plot and actors are never as important as what the camera's eye actually sees at any given moment.As for the Blu-ray, the extras include interviews with Rollin himself, Pascal, and a frequent collaborator of the director. There are great, unedited trailers for this and four additional Rollin films. As mentioned above, the transfer is rich in color and detail. While it's not quite up to today's HD standards, it's perfectly fine for a film of this vintage. There's a handy little booklet written by Tim Lucas which covers all of Jean Rollin's films (for those who have bought other Rollin titles from Redemption, this is the same book that comes with those).If you've heard about Rollin and wanted to give him a try. . .I'd actually suggest you start with Shiver of the Vampires or his most popular filmFascination. But if you like atmosphere and suggestive horror, The Iron Rose is a good choice as well.

This long-overdue compilation is quite a treat, even for fans like myself who have all John's original albums. But hearing the songs collected this way makes you realize how amazingly durable they are. Like the folk-rock songs of the 60's that we just can't forget (and which have been a prime source of inspiration to Mellencamp), many of the tunes here have defied the ages. Whether it's one of his many expertly-crafted social commentaries (still as relevant today--maybe moreso--as when they were released), or from-the-heart classics like Cherry Bomb or the lovely Ain't Even Done With The Night, almost every one of the 37 songs here is a winner.Sure, the completist has a few nits to pick: I for one would love to have remastered versions of soundtrack songs like Rave On or Baby Please Don't Go. And a couple of the "greatest hits" left me scratching my head (Martha Say? Just Another Day?). But except for a couple of very early singles (Miami, Small Paradise) and one from 1987 (Rooty Toot Toot), WORDS AND MUSIC represents pretty much every single the man released in the past 25 years.The two new tracks are welcome additions, if not instant classics. I would have gladly swapped one of them for John's duet with Travis Tritt, "What Say You," which appears on Tritt's latest album.The songs all sound fantastic, and even a casual fan really should have this set. I know these discs will be played often and played loud at my house. Enjoy!

Given Fogerty's legend status as the driving force behind CCR, and the fact that he's only done a handful of solo albums in the 30 years since the band broke up, it's easy to be overly critical of anything new. Strictly on those terms, DEJA VU is no classic. But after playing the disc 3 times thru on the first day I got it, I found it to be a compelling mix of the old and the new.The not-too-subtle title track is a reminder of John's status as a Rock Elder, as he wearily draws parallels between Iraq and Vietnam. While this won't win him any new fans among Bush supporters, there's a logic to hearing the man who recorded "Who'll Stop the Rain" and "Fortunate Son" coming out of the gate with Something To Say.In fact, "Deja Vu" (the song) makes such an opening statement that it lessens the impact of tracks 2 and 3, the otherwise worthy romantic "Sugar-Sugar" and the somewhat overwrought "She's Got Baggage."Things pick up again with "Radar" and "Honey Do", which wouldn't be out of place on a Jimmy Buffet album (it is not, however, the song of the same name that Buffet has recorded).Mark Knopfler lends his trademark guitar to "Nobody's Here Anymore," a fun rocker that takes issue with modern technology taking over our lives ("One hand on the cell phone/One hand on the mirror", Fogerty chastises the driver of an SUV)."I Will Walk with You" is a lovely hymn to a child, remiscent of Fogerty's own "Joy of My Life" from the Premonition album. Of the three remaining tunes, "Wicked Old Witch" finds Fogerty's swamp-river-hoodoo past catching up with him; it's sure to be the favorite track of die-hard Creedence fans.If I had to compare today's John Fogerty to another contemporary artist, I'd have to say it's John Mellencamp. Both have a gift for lean storytelling songs that can still make you tap your feet and sing along. And the familiarity that this listener feels may come from the fact that Mellencamp's long-time drummer, Kenny Aronoff, plays on this disc.If the years have dulled Fogerty's patented blues-shout, they have done nothing to diminish his ability to craft catchy, occasionally brilliant 3-minute rock tunes. Recommended.

I've got great memories of watching this show on Sundays night over dinner with my family. They really don't make t.v. like this anymore, and that's a shame. The Thatchers were a believable family, albeit a very unique one.I do think the first season was a bit uneven, as the show struggled to become more than just a soapbox for accepting different people (i.e., Corky's Down Syndrome). And they never could seem to figure out what to do with oldest daughter Paige (who was played by another actress in seasons 2-4). But it's still engaging family drama that never gets TOO preachy.The best part about the first season has to be Kellie Martin as Becca. The part was smarter and better-written than any teenage role I can recall. Martin just got better as the series went on; it's a shame she would only do one more series (the short-lived CHRISTY) before becoming the queen of t.v. movies throughout much of the 90's.I hope that this set sells well so Warner will be able to release the remaining seasons of Life Goes On.

Four stars for Melissa and Joey, that's easy. What I don't get is why there has been no DVD release for this? Season 1 was broken up into two 2-disc sets, and that was fine. I actually prefer it that way, to make it easier for those of us on a tight budget to collect shows without plunking down 30 or 40 bucks at one time for a complete season. What I don't get is why anyone wants to pay money to stream a program that they can't keep? Or, even in the case of a digital download. . .why would I watch a show on my computer? I have a 52" HDTV, there's no way I'm gonna watch anything more than an occasional video clip on my computer monitor. Come on, let's see the DVD's already!

You know, there's a pretty short list of big-screen movies that have spawned successful t.v. series. Off the top of my head, there's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, M*A*S*H, STARGATE SG-1, and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. And while calling this short-lived small-screen continuation of STARMAN "successful" might be stretching it a bit, I definitely feel the show outdid the movie in most every way.The basic, Fugitive-style plot, of course, was nothing groundbreaking. But where Starman shines is in the casting. It may be hard at first to put aside one's memories of Jeff Bridges--he did, after all, receive an Oscar nomination for his role in the feature film--but Robert Hayes quickly makes it his own. It helps that his alien character actually takes on a DIFFERENT body than the one in the film, so hopefully he is easier for audiences to accept. Alien "fish out of water" stories were also nothing new, even in 1986. But again, Hayes is up the challenge. His Paul Forrester may be an innocent in a cynical world, but his message of peace and understanding is universal.Likewise, the producers struck gold with C.B. (later Christopher Daniel, and no, that doesn't really make sense to me either) Barnes as the teenage offspring of Forrester and the human Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen in the film and Erin Gray capably filling her shoes here). While Forrester feels a need to protect and teach his son, the boy also does both for him.And then there's Michael Cavanaugh as George Fox, a man who is Jack McGee to Forrester's Incredible Hulk. Fox is determined to capture this man from the stars, as well as his half-human progeny ("Children are the hope of your species, not the danger," Forrester tells an unsympathetic Fox).What impresses me most about the show, even 25 years later, is how positive it is without becoming too preachy. This "Starman" is something of a pacifist, solving problems with his mind rather than threats of violence. It also is one of the few shows I can recall that presented such a strong father/son relationship (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine also handled this concept well. . .but I can't really think of any other examples). Kids from broken homes weren't anything new in 1986, but just imagine how Scott would probably be portrayed in a modern series. . .angry and antisocial, and would probably spend more time teaching his estranged father how to hack a website than learning life lessons.Aside from the fashions, cars, etc. I don't find the show dated at all. I wish there were more shows like this, instead of so-called "reality" series and unimaginative and violent crime dramas. I hope everyone who has fond memories of Starman: The Series, or just anyone seeking decent family entertainment will pick this one up.On a technical note: Be aware that Sony is offering the show in the DVD-R format, meaning it's possible some older (or cheaper) DVD players will have problems with playback. I play everything on a Blu-ray player, and can't imagine watching a show on my computer. . .but that's just me :-)

The middle chapter of Hammer's Karnstein trilogy (between The Vampire Lovers and Twins of Evil), LUST FOR A VAMPIRE is a textbook example of the studio's penchant for excess in the early '70s. Fans of classic Hammer fare like Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein will be disappointed with the weak script and atrocious acting. But if the lesbian vampire sub-genre is your thing, you'll, uh, get off on this film.Treasure or trash, LUST FOR A VAMPIRE looks fantastic thanks to the wonderful folks at Anchor Bay. There's a commentary track that is fairly pedestrian, and the goofy theatrical trailer.If this sort of thing is your cup of T (and A), by all means, sink your teeth into it.

Getting old is hell. It's true. You see, I'm old enough to have seen Friday the 13th Part 3 in the theater back in 1982. There were a handful of pretty bad 3-D movies made during that brief resurgence of the fad. Believe it or not, this was actually the best of them. The film took full advantage of the process, poking every possible object, body part, etc. at the screen. All in polarized 3-D. Polarized? Well, I don't know all the technical details, but the glasses were tinted gray, instead of the old-style red and blue that was used during the early 1950's heyday of 3-D movies. A polarized 3-D movie doesn't just have depth; things literally pop off the screen and, at times, would appear to be inches from your face.Sadly, this 3-D release of Friday the 13th Part 3 is NOT the same picture I saw all those years ago.Apparently, the polarized process can't be recreated for the home screen (not yet, anyway. . .if you'd told me ten years ago I'd be able to store thousands of songs on a gadget the size of a cigarette lighter, I'd have called you crazy). So what we have here is a sort of "remixed" cut of the film, with the old-school glasses. And all the headaches those involve.Disappointments aside, it's not a complete waste. The film itself was made to have depth (as in the third dimension of depth, not the philosophical kind!), and many scenes translate fairly well. The more notorious shock scenes (SPOILERS AHEAD) involving a spear gun and an eyeball rushing toward the camera come pretty close to duplicating the original format's intensity. Objects in the background often suffer some blurriness--hence the possibility of headaches--and the print itself is surprisingly grainy in spots.The film itself is no better or worse than any of the FRIDAY sequels. But if you were lucky enough to have the film as intended on the big screen, you will almost certainly be disappointed with this presentation. I'm glad 3-D films are making a comeback; I just hope someone is able to improve the process for home viewing.

As a lifelong fan of Looney Tunes, I was intitially excited when I heard they were making a comeback. Sure, most of the "old guard" from the classic years are no longer with us, but I though maybe the characters themselves were timeless enough to sustain a reinvention for the 21st century.Then I watched the show.I can deal with the different looks of the characters. . .every "classic" character is going to be subject to some re-interpretation. I can even understand the premise: Bugs and Daffy are now roommates living in suburbia, and their neighbors are many of the old-time LT characters. But where the show falls FAR from its roots is in the writing. The thing is just NOT funny. I'm not kidding, I will literally sit for hours and watch old Looney Tunes and laugh until I'm in tears. But over the first few episodes of The Looney Tunes Show, I don't think I managed even a chuckle.In theory, the "Merrie Melodies" sections (approx. 90 second musical numbers peformed by individual characters) is fairly original. But again, there's little enjoyment to be had. Others have been critical of the CGI Road Runner shorts (which last about 3 min.), but I actually found these to be much truer to the spirit of Looney Tunes that the hand-drawn main cartoons in each episode. By the way, that hand-drawn animation is typical of today's made-for-t.v. cartoon offerings--adequate but uninspired.For purists, the Bugs and Daffy voices are pretty good. In fact, Daffy's whole personality has been kept intact, making it easily the best thing about these cartoons. By contrast, be prepared to have your open mouth hit the floor when Witch Hazel opens her mouth and instead of the beloved voice of June Foray, we are treated to the voice of a sassy black woman (??). Gossamer (Hazel's son, and again I say "??") doesn't fare much better, as he sounds like a wimpy 8 year old.As you can see, The Looney Tunes Show just never had much of a chance of pleasing an old-time fan like myself. But even if I could somehow erase the memory of those fantastic animated treats of yesteryear, I seriously doubt I'd find much to love about this show.

I fell in love with these crunchy, cheesy snacks while living in Baltimore about 16 years ago. When I got back to my "real" home in the Deep South, I was saddened that I couldn't find them anywhere (once I drove 150 miles to a grocery store that SAID they had them, only to find them sold out!). These cheesesticks are fantastic with soups, but also great for snacking by themselves.My only complaint is that 12 boxes is a pretty big order, even for someone like me who loves them. I would like to be able to order a smaller quantity. . .maybe about half this size. Still, I DO love 'em, so it's not really a deal-breaker. A smaller-size offering would also be more desirable to someone who hasn't tried them yet; 30 bucks is a lot to spend on a snack item you've never tried.But I do hope you WILL try them, and that you enjoy them as much as I do!

Call me old (it's...uh, sorta true) but I still have way more fun out of these old quarter-munchers than the latest hi-tech game offerings. And at less than a buck a game, it's hard to find fault with this collection.If you were into coin-op games in the early-to-mid 80's, you'll likely know most of the games here. I would have paid the 20 bucks just for perfect copies of acknowledged Midway classics like Defender, Joust, Marble Madness and Paperboy. But I never dreamed I would see minor but fondly-remembered stuff like Satan's Hollow or Road Blasters on my home system.It's true, some of the controls are a bit awkward. But nearly all can be customized to your preferences. Mastering Defender II with a Gamecube controller will make you feel like a winner, no matter what you score. And the options menu can be a bit tedious at first. Remember to save your high scores to a memory card!The sights and sounds are all there, as well as some decent supplemental materials (but not for every game). If you fondly recall feeding quarters to these games all those years ago, this is a must-have.

This is definitely a more low-key affair than the two previous albums, BILINGUAL and NIGHTLIFE. &quot;I Get Along&quot; is a standout, a near-perfect pop confection that invites favorable comparison to the Beatles. And &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; challenges Neil Tennant's trademark monotone delivery (which has of course served him well over the years). But whatever good the album does is almost undone by the 9th track, the satirical (?) &quot;The Night I Fell in Love.&quot; In very unsubtle fasion, Tennant fantasizes about seducing...Eminem? What the heck is this? I suppose there is a joke here about Em's purported homophobia, but the result left me laughing in all the wrong places.And yes, true PSB fans must have the limited edition 2-disc set. RELEASE is hardly a bad effort, but I do agree with the previous reviewer that many hardcore fans will feel a bit letdown.

Lifeboat is something of an anomaly among the films of Alfred Hitchcock. It was the only film he made for 20th Century Fox (more on that in a minute). It's not usually counted among the director's best works, possibly because many of the themes common to his more popular efforts (such as the "wrong man" thrillers likeNorth By NorthwestorThe 39 Steps (Criterion Collection Spine #56)) are absent from film.The basic premise, a group of disparate strangers is stranded on a lifeboast after their ship is torpedoed by a Nazi sub, is deceptively simple. Through some clever plotting and typical Hitchcock ingenuity behind the camera, a tense tale unfolds which confounds expectations by offering up some real suspense and more than a few surprises. I won't spoil the specifics for those who haven't seen it yet, but suffice it to say that not all is as it seems aboard the seemingly doomed vessel. And if 96 minutes of nine people on a boat seems boring, there are a handful of visually shocking scenes that stave off any complacency the viewer might feel.In addition to the film, there are a couple of bonus features of special interest to fans of Hithcock. A brief featurette offers insight into the film's production. As with previous Hitch DVD releases, his daughter Pat offers first-hand accounts of the film's production. Hitchcock scholar and professor Drew Casper offers an expert commentary track as well. Best bit: Tempramental star Tallulah Bankhead apparently rarely wore underwear on the set, and was not the least bit shy around the other actors and crew (oddly enough, Casper fails to address this in the scene where Bankhead is clearly not wearing a bra, her right nipple visible through her wet blouse). We also learn that Hitchcock refused to make any more films at Fox after the studio got cold feet when promoting the film, due to early (and preposterous) allegations that the film might generate sympathy for the Nazis due to its treatment of the lone German character aboard the boat.Lifeboat certainly belongs in any Hitchcock fan's collection. I would also recommended it for anyone who enjoys WWII films; while not a typical war picture, it is clearly a product of that time.

Another rare and wonderful treat from Thunderbean! I had only seen 2 of these cartoons, and only in cheap, public-domain prints on the internet. The Van Beuren Studio has become my favorite forgotten cartoon studio, thanks to their wonderfully weird and very funny shorts. Here's a list of the cartoons on this disc:Happy Polo (1929)Summertime (1929)The Iron Man (1930)The Haunted Ship (1930)Noah Knew His Ark (1930)A Romeo Robin (1930)Hot Tamale (1930)Gypped in Egypt (1930)Makin' 'em Move (1931)The Family Shoe (1931)The Cat's Canary (1932)Toy Time (1932)Fly Frolic (1932)The Farmerette (1932)Chinese Jinks (1932)Silvery Moon (1933)There is also a wealth of supplemental material, incuding posters, audio clips, and other related memorabilia. The cartoons themselves look mostly great, with some occasional soft spots or graininess. But I highly doubt anyone will undertake a further restoration of these all-but-forgotten cinematic gems. It's nice, too, have unedited cartoons without Leonard Maltin or Whoopi Goldberg showing up to inform me that racist humor is bad (that's right, Warner Bros...I'm looking at YOU). Having said that, if you're likely to be offended by racist behavior in these 80 year old cartoons, maybe you should stay away.To be fair, not every cartoon in this collection deserves "classic" status. Van Beuren was always a hit-and-miss studio when it came to their cartoons. But surreal classics like "Silvery Moon" and the Waffles and Don adventure "Gypped in Egypt" make this a keeper. If you are a lover of early sound cartoons like I am, this certainly belongs in your collection.

It would be really hard for me to pick a favorite season of Family Ties, but #3 is tough to beat. In addition to a major change (the birth of baby Andrew in the classic 2-parter in which Elyse goes into labor during a public t.v. telethon), there are so many favorite episodes/moments: Geena Davis shakes things up as a housekeeper on whom Alex develops a crush; jealous Jennifer dressing up to crash Mallory's date; Steven & Elyse regret leaving the kids alone for the weekend; Alex taking calls on a crisis hotline. . .those are just a few off the top of my head.True, we have to wait one more season for Nick, as well as Alex's great love (and Michael J. Fox's real-life wife) Tracey Pollan. But season 3 is definitely Family Ties at the top of its game.

On first listen, I had the same reaction I did to TURN, the band's 1999 release. Good stuff, but lacking the inspiration and fun of some of their earlier records. But then I played the disc again, and began to pay attention to the lyrics. "Something Beautiful" is just that--a collection of well-crafted and often very beautiful songs. Alternating lead singers Alan Doyle and Sean McCann are also pretty talented songwriters, with Doyle (as usual) performing the more heart-tugging tunes. While longtime fans will probably agree the band has made better albums, the title song is easily one of their most uplifting and, well, beautiful recordings ever.A pre-release review (elsewhere) suggested that new producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda is trying to turn GBS into another Barenaked Ladies, with whom the producer has been associated. And while this may be an uncomfortable thought to true GBS fans, there may be something to this idea: Both bands were heroes in their homeland for years, with a string of first-rate albums, long before acheiving mainstream success in the U.S. I don't think the decrease in "traditional" music on their albums means GBS is selling out to find a wider audience. But if it takes a different approach to let more people know about this GREAT band, it's a small price to pay. And hey, isn't their "pop" material still better than most stuff on the Top 40 stations? Sure it is...go ahead and buy this one.

I have to give this one an "A" for effort. A 3-disc retrospective of rock 'n roll's original bad boy, with extensive liner notes, is a fine idea. But calling this a "career retrospective" is a bit misleading.For starters, where's Lewis's first single, Crazy Arms? You read that right: His FIRST SINGLE. A 3-disc set, 65 songs, but not his very first commercially-released song? Also MIA in this set: The seemingly-biographical ballad That Lucky Old Sun (and yes, I'm aware it was recorded by others prior to Lewis's version). And whatever you might think of the 1989 film GREAT BALLS OF FIRE, the "Killer" recorded some great material, including updated versions of many of his best-known hits. There was also his 1993 "Youngblood" album.A fourth discs of rare and unreleased songs would have also been nice, although many such gems can be found on Rhino'sRare and Rockin': Original Sun Recordings.This may all sound like nit-picking to casual fans. And it is. And for most folks, this is all the Jerry Lee Lewis they will ever need. And I'm certainly glad to have the set in my collection. Although I have most of the songs on previously-released discs, the sound quality of those eariler recordings varies greatly. So these discs will no doubt receive some heavy rotation at my house. But if you want the WHOLE Jerry Lee Lewis story, you'll have to look elsewhere to complete your collection.

Beauty & The Beast's second season had a rough start, owing to the writer's guild strike in the fall of 1988. But out of adversity often come great things, and greatness is in abundance during this beloved series' sophomore year.I don't want to give away too many plot points, for those who haven't seen (or maybe have forgotten) the events of the series. But to be fair to those who'd rather be surprised....MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD. It's safe to say that the love between Catherine and Vincent grows stronger, even as they brave seemingly insurmountable obstacles to their relationship. Returning guest stars from season one include Linda Hamilton's then-husband Bruce Abbott as Devin; Edward Albert as the ambitious yet tragic Elliot Burch; Terrylene as the deaf-mute Laura; and the wonderful Tony Jay as Vincent's chief nemesis, Paracelsus. And the many returning Tunnel characters get a chance to shine in the impressive "Dead of Winter," and in "Labyrinths," in which we learn the reasons many of them now reside beneath the streets of New York City.I will begrudgingly acknowledge there were a couple of sub-standard episodes. These include the somewhat Vincent-less "Trial," in which Catherine prosecutes a man accused of killing his son; and the excessively violent "The Hollow Men." But these are but two blemishes in an otherwise excellent season of television.On the plus side, the aforementioned "Dead of Winter" is only one of three episodes that with a Christmas theme. "Remember Love" is the B & B version of "It's a Wonderful Life"; "God Bless the Child" offers a message of hope, even as an unforeseen obstacle threatens Vincent & Catherine's relastionship. And t.v. just doesn't get any better than the season closing trilogy, which elevate this gentle romantic fantasy to near-operatic proportions. And in the best tradition of cliffhanging season-enders, leave you dying to know what comes next.This year marks the 20th anniversary of Beauty & The Beast. I hope everyone who has enjoyed this unique show will continue to support its release on DVD. We still have one more season--albeit a shortened and somewhat controvesial one--to go!

Sara Evans is that rarest of performers: Not only does she improve with each succeeding release, but she's one of the few singers today who can so effortlessly appeal to contemporary pop-country fans without alienating traditionalists. To wit: Although her first single, the soaring title track, sounds very modern, two of the first three tracks on the album ("Coalmine" and "Cheatin'") are pure retro country.Of the remaining tracks, two of the most affecting were, not surpringly, written by Evans herself. "You'll Always Be My Baby" showcases her professed love of God and Family, in a seemingly autobiographical tale of one woman's journey from child, to awkward young adult, to mother. "The Secrets That We Keep" describes the pleasures of monogamy, with a sultry and utterly convincing vocal performance.Like any good country album, there are also songs about small-town life, missing one's home, and the power of memory. My favorite among these is probably "Bible Songs," with its bittersweet reflection, "Just because you lie in his bed/Don't mean he meant the things he said."After 5 albums and a dozen or so hit singles, Evans still exists in the shadow of Modern Country-Pop Queens like Martina and Faith, and Redneck Heroine Gretchen Wilson. I hope that more people will discover not only this fantastic album, but Evans' uniformly solid catalog of first-rate discs. There's just nobody quite like her. And no recent country album by ANYONE comes close to this level of perfection.A REAL FINE PLACE, indeed.

I recently heard that Elton said this would be his final album. If that's so (and time will tell...how many KISS &quot;farewell&quot; tours have there been?) it's a fitting way to close the book on an amazing career. What strikes me about the disc is that there isn't one song that I'm tempted to skip over. As good as even his best albums are, there is always some filler. It may not spawn a bunch of hit singles, but blame that on the changes in radio over the past decade or so. Even though there's not much in the way of really &quot;rocking&quot; songs (BIRDS and WASTELAND come close, though), the slower songs are impressive for their lyrics and for Elton's piano playing. Just compare some of the standouts here--EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES, ORIGINAL SIN, DARK DIAMOND--to any of the overrated LION KING hits, or pretty much any of Elton's 90's output.This is easily his best effort since 1989's Sleeping with the Past. And THIS TRAIN DON'T STOP THERE ANYMORE is the most fitting end-of-an-era tune since Freddie Mercury offered up the eerily prophetic THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

While the 1950's will forever be THE decade of movie science fiction, Fox studios actually contributed very little to the genre during that time. But they started the decade (well, in 1951) with one of the best-known and simply BEST films of its kind,The Day the Earth Stood Still, and in 1958 gave us one of the quintessential creatures of the era with THE FLY. My own view is that the film's reputation looms a bit larger than its actual entertainment value. The main problem, hardly an uncommon one for a low-budget film of this kind, is that it's all a bit talkly. The title creature is only on-screen for a minute or two, and star Vincent Price is absent for large chunks of the running time. Still, the script (based on a short story appearing in Playboy magazine a year earlier) is intelligent and the performances are more than adequate.Price was lured back a year later for Return of the Fly, although he has been vocal over the years in his lack of enthusiasm for the film. But as sci-fi/horror sequels go, it's not a bad effort. With the "more is more" sequel mantra firmly in place, the story gives us more violence and more Fly. The third film in the series, Curse of the Fly, is something of an anomaly. It features the grandfather of the original film's scientist, but otherwise the film's continuity threads are quite thin. As someone has pointed out, there is no "fly" in the film, which probably helps explain the disappointing reception it received upon release.As for extras, the "Disc of Horrors" includes a too-brief documentary (all three films are covered in just 10 minutes), trailers and various still image galleries. I have to say I was disappointed in the documentary, as a film of THE FLY's reputation certainly warrants a deeper exploration of its creation (by contrast, note that the doc included with Day the Earth Stood Still is longer than the movie itself!). A & E's biography of Vincent Price is very well-done, though it was previously available on the excellentHeroes of Horror.All three films look and sound as good as they probably ever will, and are presented in their original Cinescope widescreen format. For fans of fifites sci-fi, The Fly Collection has been a long time coming. And while I maintain my opinion that the films are not quite classics, this is definitely a set worth owning.

As an American fan of Doctor Who, I knew nothing about this animated version until this DVD was released in the U.S. But I was intrigued by the very idea of an animated Doctor Who, and it's VERY inexpensive compared to the full-season sets, so I decided to give it a try.As others have said, the overall feel of the show is that it is aimed at younger viewers (ironically, the BBC apparently considers the live-action WHO a kid's program, and everyone I know who watches it is over 30). The plot reminded me a bit of watching the old Space Ghost cartoons from the 60's.While the characters and background are beautifully rendered, the animation is a bit limited. This is apparently the new accepted style for many animated series, but it takes some getting used to if you're a fan of classic cartoons.And while the voice acting does appear lackluster at times, I thought Anthony Head (who also appears in the 2nd season episode "School Reunion") does a fine job as the villain.Extras include brief behind-the-scenes featurettes on the making of the program. While it's good to see David Tennant and the others working outside their normal venues, most folks will probably watch the bonus features once and never again.Overall, The Infinite Quest is a mixed bag. If you're a hardcore WHO fan, you'll get a kick out of it. Casual fans, and those uninitiated to the world the time-traveling Time Lord, will probably wonder what the big deal is.

As many have already pointed out, the cartoons contained in this DVD are the usual sloppy job by cheapskate company Goodtimes Video. Apparently, the definition of "digitally remastered" is quite broad, because these cartoons (especially the color ones) look pretty bad. All the cartoons here are available in other collections, with varying degrees of quality. The only good thing about this is the rare newsreel feature that details the making of a Popeye cartoon. Animation buffs and Popeye fans will appreciate the short feature. Otherwise, we're still waiting for someone to do the spinach-eatin' sailor justice on DVD.

As a lifelong t.v. fan, I just don't know what we did before shows were available in complete seasons on DVD. Like a lot of people, I missed SAMANTHA WHO? during its initial run. And thanks to DVD, I can now rectify that mistake.The premise is simple enough: After waking from an 8-day coma with retrograde amnesia, a woman (the often-underrated Christina Applegate) sets about finding who she is. But the catch is that, who she WAS before her accident was not a nice person. At all. With the at-times dubious support of her family and friends, Samantha sets out to become a better person with the second chance she's been given.Like I said, simple enough. But the writers don't use amnesia as a cop-out for cheap laughs (an early episode makes an in-joke to this effect, referring to amnesia as a tool for "lazy writers"). It is instead used to illuminate the human condition, albeit with some very funny stumbles along the way. When Samantha starts having flashbacks to what will aptly become known as "bad Sam," Applegate really gets to open up. As funny and innocent as she plays Sam in the present, the Sam of the past is a complete 180 turn into an evil, mean-spirited, backstabbing opportunist.It's an addicting journey (again with the DVD sets...I watched the entire series in 2 days) that's both funny and real. It's not perfect, though, and the latter half of this abbreviated (15 episodes) season seems a bit unfocused. Still, Applegate--who also serves as a producer on the show--surrounds herself with an equally-adept cast, including Jean Smart, Melissa McCarthy and the somewhat underutilized Tim Russ as Samantha's sage, dry-witted doorman.The only extra features are a far-too-brief montage of outtakes, and some deleted scenes. But there's a nice foldout booklet included, in which the various characters offer advice to Samantha.The best thing about this season one set is that it made me a fan, hungry for the next season of Samantha's story. There's not that many sitcoms out there these days, and even fewer that one could call original. But SAMANTHA WHO? is quite refreshing. I know I won't forget to watch it now. Ha ha...won't forget, did you see what I did there?

First of all, this was a GREAT idea. I always appreciate documentary material added onto my favorite movies. Now, here's five very well-made docs on five great stars of horror cinema. Each is about 45 min. long, for I believe these originally aired as hour-long (with commericals) specials on the A &amp; E network.Each documentary traces its star from birth to death, with scores of old photos and film clips, and recent interviews with family members, friends and co-stars. It's a measure of their success that 3 out of the 5 stories had me near tears near the end, whether the subject's life ended on life-affirming high note (Vincent Price) or ravaged by diseases of the body and mind (Chaney, Lugosi).Just the five programs here would have been worth the very reasonable price, but that's far from all you get on these 2 discs. There are generous collections of film trailers for each star, as well as other featurettes to keep you busy for hours. I'd suggest calling in sick and just spending a whole day with your favorite HEROES of the silver scream.

OK, classic gamers, if you've been holding off on getting that Gameboy Advance, you're running out of excuses! Atari Arcade Advance is a near-perfect gaming experience for those of us that used pump quarters into arcade machines back in the early 80's. All the translations are faithful, and the trivia game is pretty fun. I especially love being able to take TEMPEST with me anywhere! The only minor complaint I have is with the controls. The Gameboy's directional keypad makes trackball games like MISSILE COMMAND and CENTIPEDE a bit problematic. But you'll get used to it, and there's really no reason not to add this to your collection.

It seems that Rob Zombie's Halloween is a love-it-or-hate kind of thing. Well, that places me firmly in the HATE IT category. The main problem I have with the story is how much time is devoted to Michael Myers' troubled childhood. So, little Mikey is picked on at school, he kills animals, and his homelife truly sucks. So...are we supposed to feel sympathy when he becomes a raging psychopath? I certainly didn't.And, since this is a Rob Zombie film, you have to include virtually non-stop profanity, sickening violence and thoroughly loathesome characters. Others have menioned that Myers' mother was the lone sympathetic character in the film. And she's a stripper. Not much sympathy there, either.Look, I LIKE horror movies. And I like the original Halloween and maybe about half of the sequels. But this thing is just pitiful. There's no suspense, no levity at all, just 2 hours of in-your-face filth and violence. I can't imagine what anyone sees in this garbage.

I just don't understand all the complaints about the "hip young cast" in this latest Twilight Zone. The original series had known stars, or up-and-coming ones. The 80's series did the same. Why shouldn't UPN have used stars to get people to tune in? And while we're at it, Forest Whittaker does a fine job as host. I always felt his performance was sort of a tribute to Serling. He has a great voice, and that's about all I require from a narrator.Most of the episodes are worthy of the Serling name as well. They're well-written, well-produced, and (usually) well-acted. Jason Alexander gives the performance of his career in "One Night At Mercy." Much attention has been given to the remake/sequel episodes, but personally they just reminded me of how great the originals were.Look, there will never be another Rod Serling. And there's not likely to be another show as fresh and original as the Zone was in its original form. But this oft-maligned 2002 version deserves better.

Much like Tom & Jerry Tales, this new direct-to-video feature honors the duo's classic animation legacy while still feeling suitably "modern" for today's younger viewers. A top-notch voice cast lends weight to the human characters of Holmes (Michael York), Watson (John Rhys-Davies) and Moriarty (Malcolm McDowell). Thankfully, the cat-and-mouse team remains speechless (seeTom and Jerry - The Movie, if you dare, for evidence of why talking just doesn't suit the characters).The plot is standard Baker Street stuff, involving stolen jewels and dastardly inventions (a few of which comes across a bit TOO advanced for the period setting). Tex Avery's unforgettable Red and the Wolf figure into the plot as well, along with cameos from Spike, Droopy and a few other minor characters from the old days.The animation is mostly very good, with precious little of the 3-D shading that only serves to remind long-time fans that they're NOT watching the characters with whom they grew up. A final-act chase on a runaway carriage is particularly impressive, ending as it does atop the still under-construction London Bridge.Aside from a couple of trailers, the only bonus feature is a brief art lesson, "How to Draw Tom and Jerry." While the process is interesting to watch, it's unlikely that viewers will be ready to put any of Warner Bros' animators out of business anytime soon.While the brief running time (50 min. for an "all-new original movie") might seem slight, it's about as long as it needs to be. The film is perfectly safe for kids, if you don't mind exaggerated cartoon violence. For adults who love Tom and Jerry, it's also a nice effort and probably won't tarnish your memories of the beloved cartoon stars.

OK, first let's get the movie out of the way. It stinks. A handful of B-list actors are put in forced servitude of a script that goes nowhere. When your opening credits proudly (and oh-so-inaccurately) boast "H.G. Wells' World of the Worlds" and your opening scene is a gratutious shot of your lead actress topless. . .well, you know this isn't going to be a classic. Then, because anyone with an iMac can produce affordable CGI effects these days, the producers seem to have found someone with an iMac to produce affordable CGI effects. You're not likely to see less convincing effects in this lifetime, believe me. I'm sparing you the plot details, because I'm currently trying to forget I ever watched this movie.Far more entertaining is the documentary (one of the MANY bonus features inexplicably afforded this turkey). Watch in awe as the director recalls reading the original novel (a dubious claim in itself) "when I was a kid in school, back in the 1800's." Sit dumbfounded as the producer talks of rushing to complete this film to beat the Speilberg version, and proudly proclaiming, "They've got Tom Cruise, but WE'VE got Tommy Howell!"There are even TWO audio commentaries, but I frankly couldn't sit through them. And there are outtakes and deleted scenes (97 minutes of which seemed to have made into the final film...heh heh).I've seen this one in the bargain bin for like 4 bucks. And it might be worth that, just for a good laugh. But fans of the original George PalThe War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition), or even the flawed but admittedly more exciting Speilberg film, would do well to steer clear of this one.

I really had to force myself to give this even 3 stars, mainly because there are a few animated gems in here worth owning. As others have said, not all the cartoons here have a "spooky" theme. But some of them have elements, such as ghosts or grotesque creatures, so I'm a little more forgiving than some with regard to the misleading title.One of the real standouts is "Wot a Night," a sort of prototype for the Abbott & Costello Meet the Monsters films Universal made. The film's style resembles the Fleischer cartoons of the early 1930's. The two Casper cartoons are just passable; I was never a huge fan, but there has to be some better vehicles for the "Friendly Ghost." "Ouija Board" is another rare oddity: an "Out of the Inkwell" short featuring silent star Koko the Clown. The Popeye cartoon is typical of a Famous Studios' cartoon of the 50's: colorful but bland. Of the two Betty Boop shorts, I actually kind of liked "Is My Palm Read?", although the "spooky" elements don't appear until the film minute or two. "Jack Frost" and "Balloon Land" are great, classic Ub Iwerks cartoons that aren't really very scary. "Lunar Luger" is a trip for sci-fi fans, but probably doesn't belong in this collection.If you're a fan of classic early animation, you'll find enough here to hold your interest. However, be warned: As with all Winstar DVD's, the audio/visual quality is questionable. The color cartoons usually have a washed-out look, and the otherwise excellent "Wot a Night" actually looks like it was filmed on a shaky tripod. The much-hyped "enhanced audio" is just distracting. . .none of these cartoons were created with Dolby 5.1 surround sound in mind.If you can pick it up used for a few bucks, it's not a bad disc.

I believe there are 2 kinds of Jimmy Buffet fans: (1) Those who grew up in the 70's before all this Parrothead stuff and believe with all their hearts that Mr. Buffet hasn't done anything really worthwhile since the early 80's. (2) The Parrotheads themselves, who bestow adulation on anything the man does, musically, or otherwise.I am neither of these.I like good music, and I feel there are several Buffet albums, old and not-so-old, that fit into this category. BANANA WIND distiguishes itself by being as close to a concept album as Buffet has probably ever done. Most of the songs have an unmistakable Cuban vibe. And most of them are about living the Good Life and Having Fun.But. . .and I think both types of fans will agree. . .Buffet's greatest strength has always been as a songwriter. He's an observer, often a casual one, of the human condition. And he's shamelessly, relentlessly, old-fashioned. "Are we destined to be ruled/By a bunch of old white men/Who compare the world to football/And are programmed to defend?" he wonders in ONLY TIME WILL TELL, an opening statement still, ironically, quite fresh 10 years after it was recorded. His bitterness continues on OVERKILL, this time aimed at a recording industry that (at the time, remember Jimmy's first-ever Grammy award was still 7 years away) has either ignored or treated him with disdain for decades: "A million here, a million there/A mindless corporate dance/Get paid for fu**in' off/In the South of France."Not that BANANA WIND doesn't have its share of toe-tapppin' overtures to Buffet's patented beach-bum lifestyle. Story songs like JAMAICA MISTAICA (a reportedly true story about Buffet and U2 lead singer Bono being mistaken for drug runners), HOLIDAY and BOB ROBERT'S SOCIETY BAND rank among his most witty compositions.Even I (and I'm not taking sides...see the first paragraph) admit that Buffet's output in the 90's was a bit uneven. But I'd rank BANANA WIND at the top, because it's the only one from that period that I can listen to straight through without being temped to skip track here and there.For Buffet fans: Don't waste my time, you already have it.For Good Music fans: A great sampler from a paradoxical icon.

There are many great reviews here that go into detail about the show. And I agree with almost all of them: Doctor Who is a terrific show--fast, fun, and full of wonder. But let me talk for minute about the price of these sets.As you probably already know, a season (or "series" if you like) of Doctor Who runs 13 hour-long episodes. That's just over half the length of a season of most American one-hour shows, which usually are comprised of 22 or 24 episodes. When you consider that a large majority of American series' full-season sets are priced at under $50, it seems hard to justify the pricetag for these BBC shows."But Doctor Who is so much BETTER than those other shows!" you might exclaim. And I'd have to more or less agree, although there are exceptions such as moderately-priced sets for THE X-FILES or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. I can only hope we will soon see a price drop, as was the case with some of the STAR TREK series.I love Doctor Who, but I'm holding out a better deal.

Wow! From the moment you pop in the disc, you're treated to a hypnotic &quot;swirling&quot; effect complete with narration. The number of features on this disc is mind-boggling. Some are priceless, some are. . .not. But you'll have so much fun exploring it, you'll forgive the cheesy 3-D segment. No real horror fan can afford to be without this amazing collection of featurettes, trailers, and assorted spooky fun stuff. Buy it!!

For those of us who were there, the 1983 original "V" minseries (and its sequel the following year) were Event Television. The weekly series that followed wasn't well-received by comparison. I'm not sure why that is, as it was a reasonably well-made, action-packed continuation of the story.The first dozen or so episodes were the best, as Marc Singer's Mike Donovan looked for his son while trying to hold together the rag-tag band of resistance fighters. Along with Faye Grant as Juliet Parish and the ever-imposing Michael Ironside as Ham Tyler, Singer helped carry the episodes. But around episode 12 (it's been awhile, so forgive me if I'm off by one or so) about the half the cast was written out, including Ironside. The remaining episodes degenerated in quality, but the final cliffhanger (the NEVER RESOLVED cliffhanger) was very exciting."V" originally conceived as a WWII allegory; the weekly show, while perhaps omitting some of the more intellectual and philosophical beats, still stands up as a well-made bit of action/sci-fi. Give it another chance, I think you'll find it wasn't nearly as bad as its detractors suggest.

At last, two latter-day Hammer horror classics arrive, and in a bargain-priced deluxe treatment! MGM has really done a fine job with this Ingrid Pitt double-feature. Both films feature commentary from Pitt and others involved in the productions. The commentaries are a bit dry, but nonetheless informative and entertaining. As an added bonus, you get Ingrid Pitt reading excerpts from &quot;Carmilla&quot; (upon which THE VAMPIRE LOVERS was loosely--very loosely--based).COUNTESS DRACULA has not been, to my knowledge, commercially available in the U.S. until now. The widescreen transfer is certainly an improvement over my old &quot;bootleg&quot; VHS copy, with rich colors and a remarkably clean and crisp audio track. That being said, I find the film itself to be the lesser of the two on this disc. But of course, it's nice to have this rarely-seen Hammer flick.THE VAMPIRE LOVERS finds Pitt it top form as the tortured Mircalla Karnstein. Even more delightful is doe-eyed Madeline Smith as Emma, the bewitching innocent caught up in this sapphic web of fangs and flesh.This is one &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; offering that any fan of classic horror will definitely want to own. Or, if you're just curious about Hammer films or Ingrid Pitt, here's a very affordable way to check 'em out. Recommended, for sure.

As I said in my review forTom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 1, I am impressed with how faithful TOM AND JERRY TALES is to the classic MGM T & J shorts. Vol. 5 continues the tradition with another dozen fast and funny cartoons.I've always been a big fan of Halloween and/or "spooky"-themed cartoons, and there's a trio included here. The best of these is "Monster Con", in which Tom faces off with a Van Helsing-inspired monster hunter. The inimitable Droopy co-stars in "A Life Less Guarded." There's also an extreme sports theme running throughout the collection, as the classic cat and mouse team compete in skateboarding, cycling and tennis.TOM AND JERRY TALES offers plenty of action (with mild animated violence, if that sort of thing concerns you) to keep younger kids interested, and enough comic antics to appeal to the kids in us all. I recommend getting them all.

With so many acknowledged classics from Hammer Studios already available on DVD, I was beginning to wonder if lesser-known efforts like these would ever be released. In case you may have missed them, here's a bit about the films themselves:TWO FACES OF DR. JECKYLL is the real gem of the set. Christopher Lee is perfectly cast as the hedonistic friend to Paul Massie's Dr. Jeckyll. Hammer favorite Terence Fisher directs this very adult (for its time) story.CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB is neither the worst (The Mummy's Shroud) nor best (Blood From the Mummy's Tomb) of Hammer's follow-ups to the 1959 original Mummy. In the worst tradition of Mummy movies, however, it's a pretty dull offering.THE GORGON is a fine pairing of icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and is among Hammer's most expensive-looking productions. The title creature reminds one of the work done by the great Ray Harryhausen.SCREAM OF FEAR is another seldom-seen thriller, much in the vein ofPsycho (Collector's Edition). It's certainly the most realistic of the films in this collection.While no single film here (with the possible exception of TWO FACES...) really compares to Hammer's best films, there's still plenty of b-grade thrills for fans of films of this type.

NOTE: This review contains minor spoilers...you've been warned! Like many other "Doctor Who" fans, I've always found the spin-off "Torchwood" to be hit-and-miss. But with "Children of Earth," the slate has been wiped clean. It's only 5 episodes, but every one hits the mark. The story of aliens returning to earth after an extended absence is nothing new, of course. But the beauty is in the execution. The site of children all over the world suddenly stopping in the their tracks, then becoming the mouthpiece for an invasion force is nothing less than chilling. But Children of Earth is so much more than that. The three surviving members of Torchwood all have their personal story arcs, fleshing out their characters like never before. While the aliens, dubbed the "456", attack humanity where it hurts (our children), each of the three main players examines his or her own family in ways that are often surprising. And while Torchwood has also been the most adult of the modern "Who" universe, it has never seemed more focused. Like the best science-fiction novels, the story touches on ideas that are far beyond the mundane. Government responsibility and even complicity, as well as individuals' rights, are a major theme. And Russell T. Davies' script isn't afraid to ask the big questions: Would you sacrifice your future to save the present? Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? Even with all its philosophic touchtones, Children of Earth is also an action-packed adventure. Production values are high; in fact, with maybe 30 or 40 minutes trimmed, it would have made an excellent big-screen movie. For fans of the show, it's a must-have (Gwen's realization that a certain well-traveled Time Lord is not going to swoop in and save the world is a fan-stroking high point). But even for casual viewers or people not familiar with the backstory, it's still first-class science-fiction.

After that silly witches and stones business (not to mention the Teagues...yawn) in season four, SMALLVILLE got back on track with this excellent season (SPOILERS AHEAD). The year started off with a bang, with Kryptonian villains, including the great James Marsters as Brainiac. Chloe, now a keeper of Clark's secret, stopped being an annoyance and become a great ally. Lex learned the true meaning of Christmas. Two other DC heroes debuted: Cyborg and Aquaman ("Aqua" is arguably among the season's best episodes). The series even celebrated its milestone 100th episode with the death of a major character.What more can I say? Oh, yeah, how about this? The Fortress of Solitude. An enemy learns Clark's secret...and (so far) doesn't tell anyone. The Phantom Zone. SENATOR Martha Kent. The widening gap between Clark and Lex. The, uhh, narrowing gap between Lana and Lex.Every season, despite significant and occasionally great individual episodes, had its clunkers. These are hard to find in season five. SMALLVILLE has beaten the odds to become not only a huge success, but very much a part of the overall Superman mythology.

SEA OF NO CARES continues in the same vein as Great Big Sea's previous studio album, TURN. Which is to say, a bit more original material and less of the traditional sea shanties and drinkin' songs. The shift toward more pop music may put off longtime fans, but the band is well-suited to this kind of progression.&quot;Clearest Indication&quot; is a standout ballad, and reminded me of the heartbreaking tune &quot;How Did We Get From Saying I Love You&quot; from the band's PLAY album. &quot;Sea of No Cares,&quot; &quot;A Boat Like Gideon Brown,&quot; and &quot;Own True Way&quot; rank among the best songs in their impressive catalog. And anyone who's ever been married (as in the past tense) will find it impossible not to laugh (and soon sing along) with &quot;Scolding Wife.&quot;Of the twelve tunes here, only one, &quot;Widow in the Window,&quot; didn't do much for me. Otherwise, a solid album from a talented bunch of guys who just keep getting better with time.ALSO RECOMMENDED: UP (their best) and the live album ROAD RAGE.

As a huge fan of Halloween, monsters and cartoons, I expected to absolutely love this rarely-seen 1972 Rankin/Bass special. The t.v. special had fallen into relative obscurity over the years, even though it was a sequel of sorts to the earlier stop-motion cult classicMad Monster Party. Indeed, this DVD debut was the first time I'd ever seen it. Unfortunately, "Mad Mad Mad Monsters" uses hand-drawn animation rather than RB's wonderful stop-motion magic, and that's only the start of the problems.The main thing (and again, I WANTED so much to love it) is that the special just isn't very engaging or funny. The marginal plot has Baron Von Frankenstein (voiced by a fairly good Karloff imitator, since the legendary star had passed on by this time) creating a bride for his monster, then planning a wedding packed with some wonderfully ghoulish guests. Getting all the classic monsters together worked fine in Mad Monster Party, but just falls flat here. The original feature was helped along by some inspired, wacky musical numbers. Sadly, these don't exist in the follow-up. The humour, such as it is, falls a few steps below the "Laugh-In"-style gags ofGroovie Goolies: Saturday Mourning Collection(sample joke: Upon seeing his two creatures meet, Frankenstein declares, "It's like you were MADE for each other. . .wait a minute, you WERE made for each other!").Fairing slightly better is the bonus feature, an episode of Rankin/Bass's "Festival of Family Classics" entitled "Jack O'Lantern" (also from 1972). The half-hour shows were retellings of popular folk heroes and children's stories. Like the main feature, it features hand-drawn animation akin to "Frosty the Snowman."I've given the disc 3 stars because I feel it is imporant to have rare, almost-forgotten animated shows released, and because the prints used by Classic Media are really quite good. There are no additional features, including addtional subtitles or language tracks. If you have kids (even grown-up ones) who are monster fans, this might even find a place among their annual Halloween viewing. And for the money, you could really do a lot worse.

On the DVD accompanying Great Big Sea's 2005 album "The Hard and the Easy", the Newfounland-based Celtic rockers indicate this self-titled debut is still their favorite album. Perhaps it's that feeling of "it's never as good as the first time." But the fact is, Great Big still had a ways to go when this independent-label disc was released in 1993.For fans who relish the band's traditional songs--often age-old sea shanties, drinking songs and odes to their homeland--this album is one to treasure. I personally discovered Great Big Sea with their follow-up 1995 album "Up", in which the tradional material is mixed with a handful of upbeat original numbers. Most of their succeeding albums would follow this formula, bringing the band increasing success with each release.The best parts of the album are GBS's versions of "Drunken Sailor", "I'se the B'y", and the studio version of live favorite "Excursion Around the Bay." If you're new to the band, I'd still recommend getting "Up" first, and mabye the 2002 release "Sea of No Cares."

WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS.Coming on the heels of the terrificIron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition), I was a little concerned that lightning wouldn't strike twice for Marvel. But I'm happy to report that The Incredible Hulk was every bit as good as Iron Man. Maybe, in some small ways, even better.I was a huge fan of the Bill Bixy/Lou Ferrigno t.v. series, even though it bore little resemblance to the Marvel comic book. But it was great entertainment, full of action, and a better-than-average peformance from Bill Bixby as Dr. David Banner. Louis Letterier's big-screen reboot wisely takes a note (several notes, in fact) from the series, turning the film into a sort of "Fugitive" with gamma radiation. There are several sly references to the t.v. show, including cameos by Ferrigno, the late Bixby, a young journalism student named Jack McGee, and for one brief nostalgia-laden moment. . .that aching, unforgettable piano theme which closed each episode.OK, fine, you say, what about the film itself? Norton, who also co-wrote the script, handles his duties as Banner as well as can be expected. I've never been a huge fan of Liv Tyler, but she's also well cast as Betty Ross (reportedly Norton wrote the part with Tyler in mind). William Hurt overracts like mad as General Ross, who's probably the most "comic book" character in the film. Well...no, Eli Roth's character becomes another rampaging creature, in a predictably CGI-heavy climax.Still, for all its occasional predictability and reliance on special effects, the film offers many fine moments. The 2 or 3 big action set pieces are expertly-realized, with a standoff on a college campus standing out as one of the most memorable sequences. And, like the Hulk of comic book origin, this Hulk can talk. And although he's a creature of few words, I guarantee you'll remember each one.Although it was eclipsed by Iron Man in box office receipts, The Incredible Hulk was a solid hit, and is certainly a welcome addition to big-screen Marvel universe. A closing cameo from Robert Downey Jr. ties the two films together neatly. And you can bet we'll be seeing more Hulk on the big screen in the future.

It's true: Universal just got around to releasing decent DVD's of Psycho II and III last year. But this set marks the DVD debut of the often-overlooked Psycho IV. So yes, it is a bit redundant for fans who already own 2 out of the 3 films here. But at such a low price, I think it's worth it.Psycho IV: The Beginning was made for the Showtime cable network in 1990. The film was released on VHS the following year, but that tape has long been out-of-print. The film itself achieves something quite amazing, considering (1) It's the fourth film in a series, and (2) it's a made-for-t.v. movie--not usually the mark of quality entertainment. It was written by Joseph Stefano, who penned the classic Hitchock-directed original based (loosely) on Robert Bloch's novel. At the time Psycho IV was made, Stefano was open about his distaste for the previous sequels, which were made without his involvement. But for fans worried about continuity, the film doesn't really ignore the events of Psycho II and III. . .it just doesn't dwell on them.Fans of the previous films might also be concerned (SPOILERS AHEAD) about Anthony Perkins' reduced screen time, since about 70% of the story is composed of flashback to Norman's younger days. But the script gives Perkins some great dialogue, most of it between Bates and the late-night radio talk-show host he's called. And Stefano--himself a long-time recipient of psychoanalysis--fills Bates' backstory with moments of both cruelty and, in rare moments, subtle beauty.For the uninititated, parts II and III are also fine sequels (take THAT, Mr. Stefano). Psycho II is the more well-regarded, with its slow-building suspense and more restrained approach. I actually prefer Psycho III, which balances some over-the-top gore with black humour that I'm sure Hitch himself would have appreciated.The bottom line is, you're getting 3 superior horror sequels at a bargain price. What more do you need to know? Highly recommended.

That fact that you're even reading this review suggests you're one of the lucky few folks who discovered this awesomely underrated trio in the late 80's/early 90's. Combining infectious pop/punk hooks with a surprising lyrical depth, Material Issue put out three excellent albums during their brief career (a fourth disc,Telecommando Americano, was released in 1997 after lead singer Jim Ellison's death). What this Millenium Collection offers is a sampling of their catalogue: 4 tracks from each of their first two releases, 2 from the third disc, one from the posthumous release, and a previously-unreleased live cover of Sweet's "Ballroom Blitz."If you're never heard them--and there's a good chance you haven't--this is certainly a fine place to start. But if you can get your hands on all their albums (some of which are long out-of-print), they're all worth owning.

Here's a real treat for Lugosi fans--an in-depth, fascinating, and utterly entertaining hour featuring lots of previously-unseen material. The clips from his early silent films are beautifully restored, and left this reviewer with a strong urge to see the complete films. There's an impressive array of interviews with former co-stars and friends, and some surprisingly clear interviews with the star himself (some of these also appear on Roan's excellent &quot;White Zombie&quot; disc).I was also impressed by the sometimes hallucinatory editing style--often a rapid succession of film clips set to spooky music--that made the documentary every bit as entertaining as watching one of Bela's movies.If I have one minor gripe, it's that a large amount of &quot;deleted scenes&quot; could have been editing back into the feature. Most of them are expanded interviews and clips from particular films. I'm sure the decision was made to cut these extra scenes for reasons of pacing or time. But a true Lugosi fan would not only NOT mind the extra padding, he (or she) would most likely appreciate it. It's a minor point, because of course you can access all these extra scenes from the main menu.Order this one, you won't be disappointed.

While it's true this excellent documentary would probably not have been made if there was no SUPERMAN RETURNS, it doesn't matter. Seventy years of Superman history PRIOR to the new movie certainly warrants this much attention.Virtually no stone is left unturned in this feature-length exploration of Superman's history. From his first comic book appearance through all the t.v. and movie incarnations, this is the definitive visual guide to the Man of Steel. Even die-hard fans are likely to learn a few new things about their favorite hero. For example, did you know there was an attempt at a live-action kids' series in the late 50's called "Superpup"? The never-aired clip from the pilot episode has to be seen to be believed. There was also a never-seen live-action Superboy pilot, as well as a painfully bad musical version in the 70's. You'll marvel with disbelief as the Last Son of Krypton SINGS to bad guys as he's smacking them around, complete with 60's-era Batman-style "Pow!"'s, etc.Of course, there's plenty of coverage of the successful screen variations, including the still-unsurpassed George Reeves series, some (but not quite all) the animated series, and Smallville. Director Kevin Burns enlists everyone he could find from those shows, as well as celebrity fans like Mark Hamill and Gene Simmons.I think even a casual Superman fan will enjoy this lengthy, but thoroughly engaging documentary. I expect it is a show I will return to view many times in years to come.

Having re-lived many shows from my childhood via DVD in the past few years, I've learned to approach new releases with some trepidation. The harsh reality of growing up (for me, anyway) is that sometimes nostalgic feelings for a show don't always overcome its now-obvious deficits. I'm happy to say that, for the most part, this is not the case with Dungeons and Dragons.The stories are. . .well, not quite ADULT, but a little better developed than most "kids" shows. The excellent voice cast lends credibility to the characters. You really care about what happens next to those kids.My only real complaint with the show itself is the shockingly limited animation. The world of D & D is populated by all sorts of fantastic creatures and worlds, most of which are well-drawn. But the movement, even in action-packed scenes, is pretty static.Now, the DVD presentation is first-class. There's a well-made documentary detailing the making of the series, a few commentary tracks, and "Uni's Fun Facts," a text-only trivia section for each episode. The mini D & D manual will be of interest to anyone who's ever played the Dungeons & Dragons game.If you are able to overlook some minor shortcomings, this is certainly a fine purchase for fans of the show.

Now that this VHS version is no longer even available, Universal simply MUST release this superior sequel on DVD. I've got the tape, but you know, these things don't last forever. :-)I really think the Psycho films were truly among the last truly quality horror film series. The film, unfortunately did not benefit from a theatrical release. It was, instead, sent directly to the Showtime cable network in 1990. This was a time when moviegoing horror fans were been subjected to the 5th "Nightmare on Elm Street" film and the EIGHTH in the "Friday the 13th" series. I guess Psycho IV's producer weren't confident that aging psychopath Norman Bates (and aging actor Anthony Perkins) would find much of an audience among the slaser fans.And that's a shame, because both Perkins and the film itself offer a worthy conclusion to the series. Psycho IV was written by Joseph Stefano, who wrote the original film based on Robert Bloch's novel. Stefano, himself a long-time recipient of psychoanalysis, gives the story of Norman Bates' childhood a harrowing (yet occasionally poetic) realism. And although Perkins' role is reduced due to about 70 percent of the story being presented as flashbacks, it just might be his best performance ouf of all four films.Now that Universal has finally given us decent DVD releases of Psycho 2 and 3, it's time to complete the series.

OK, I'm not one those people who think Prince stopped making good music after &quot;Sign O' the Times.&quot; He released quite a bit of first-rate material in the 90's. But I'd have to say MUSICOLOGY is his most cohesive and enjoyable album since 1995's THE GOLD EXPERIENCE.Yeah, this isn't all new territory. Not at all...in fact, much of this album calls to mind the finer points of 1996's overblown 3-disc EMANCIPATION. It's mostly solid, funky pop with occasional flashes of brilliance. And isn't that really what we expect from Prince?And MUSICOLOGY is, at its heart, a straight-up Prince album. He still wants to get the girl (and grow old with her, in the lovely closing number &quot;Reflection&quot;). He's still not down with war (the melodic &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;). And oh, yes, his sense of humor is still quite intact (&quot;My voice is getting higher/And I ain't never had my nose done&quot; he quips in a not-too-veiled dig at that fun-loving old rival, Michael Jackson). Quick to turn a phrase and name-drop old-school heroes like Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Prince the Songwriter is in top form.So, is MUSICOLOGY the big commerical comeback people are saying it could be? Well...probably not. But in what music historians must surely one day call the Golden Age of Hip Hop, it's a nice reminder of a rule that everyone (Prince included) should maybe fall back on now and then: Less is more. For MUSICOLOGY is, for the most part, a lean and tight collection of jams that is blissfully short on filler. Even if you haven't bought a Prince album in 15 years, give this one a try.

I think this set has been unfairly maligned. Many of the critical reviews here complain that the cartoons aren't as good as the black & white Fleischer Studios' Popeye shorts. And while that is certainly true, it doesn't mean that these cartoons are bad.Many of them feature outrageous situations which set them apart from the more grounded approach taken in the earlier cartoons. But any Popeye fan worth his (sea) salt will recognize that Segar's original comic strips often featured his characters in situations which stretch credibility beyond the breaking point.These cartoons from 1960-61 are colorful, quick and fun. I was highly entertained throughout all 85 (!) shorts. And I don't know why some reviewers are claiming the 'toons aren't remastered; they look fantastic. The set is also a great deal for the price.

While classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny to Garfield the cat are busy getting (largely unwelcome) 21st century makeovers, it's comforting to see MGM allowing Tom & Jerry to pretty much remain themselves in a series of direct-to-videos features. Even as the stories are getting more ambitious (such as in the duo's previous releaseTom & Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes [Blu-ray]), the beloved cat-and-mouse team has remained mostly unchanged.So here we find them inserted into one of the most-loved stories of all time. For longtime fans like myself, the very title alone brings shivers of anticipation. Tom and Jerry combined with the Wizard of Oz? How can you go wrong? And as others have pointed out, this is isn't simply the L. Frank Baum "Oz" story, it's the defintive MGM film version that is being utilized.Right there at the Gale farm among Dorothy, Toto and those hired hands, we find Tom and Jerry. And they're not just tagging along; Auntie Em tells the pair to be sure and "look out for Dorothy" right before the tornado strikes. From there, the story unfolds almost exactly as it does in the film version. This is both a great asset AND a bit of a liability, however. The only real problem I have with this otherwise entertaining and very well-animated film is that things happen a bit too fast. It's as if the writers are saying "OK, we all know what happens in Munchkinland, so we can just skip over that." And Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road is also very abbreviated; indeed, the cat and mouse (who've picked up a Munchkin mouse, the only other real deficit here) arrive too late to see Dorothy meeting the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion.The voicework and animation are all top-notch, especially for a made-for-video feature. And if you overlook the stuff I mentioned above, you'll likely to have a good time. Like all the previous Tom & Jerry features, it's perfectly safe for kids. There's even some kid-friendly activities in the bonus materials. Oh, and be sure to watch the film with the sepia-toned opening scenes (listed here, oddly, as a bonus feature) to get the real classic Wizard of Oz effect.Recommended for fans of T & J and The Wizard of Oz.
