Okay, let's face it, Keanu was not the guy who should have done this flick. Yes, he's pretty. But Constantine's character is really a down, dark guy doomed to hell. It needed an actor who could convincingly portray the emotions, that heavy negativism burying a nugget of hope that heaven might cut him some slack. I needed to see a face that reeked of internal putrefaction (the cancer, the despair) as well as obsession. We needed someone who could really dig in and pull out a performance. Keanu, photogenic as he is, even likable as he is, just can't do this. I don't believe him as a guy dying from lung cancer and well-acquainted with hellfire.Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton are good, Rachel VERY good. Tilda seems to be ready to make a career on playing gender-benders (see ORLANDO). She has the look for it, I guess.I kept thinking, too, that Satan should be much more beautiful (the fallen angel of light) and much more threatening. (This guy was creepy, but hardly to the levels of a Lucifer.) This movie reminded me of The Prophecy meets The Matrix meets Spawn. (And wasn't Gabriel also human-hating in The Prophecy?) But Viggo Mortensen's Lucifer was better than this guys, hands down--seductive, yet repulsive. Bring Viggo back!The effects were good. I enjoyed the "vacation gone really, really bad/The Day After" vision of hell. The demons were well done. I liked the apprentice guy, and wish they'd let him do a bit more.Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the ending very much. Then again, I'm not averse to happy endings. :) In fact, I love them. I would have given this a three if not for the hell scenes and the ending.Another negative: What was with the sound? About a fifth of what Keanu says is unintelligible. I had to rewind several times.Still, I sat through it and wasn't bored, even if I wasn't astonished or thrilled to bits. It's an okay fantasy ride. It's a watchable, if not terrific, couple hours of effects-laden Hollywood.Ah, but if only they'd gotten somebody else for Constantine!

I have been a loyal user of Inner Grace for more than a year--and that remains my fave Philosophy shower gel. However, I got a yen to try one of the others. I almost got the Amazing Grace, but at the last minute, changed to this one. Why? There's something about this scent that takes me back. There is this "baby cologne" smell that is reminiscent of the way children smelled in my Cuban childhood. Not the violet baby cologne, but a more perfumey, less floral one--crisper, more unisex and "soapy". That nostalgia is worth paying extra for.I like the creamy formula, even though it does have a strong surfactant--SLS--which will irritate some. I have supersensitive skin and, sometimes, I have to go strictly with Cetaphil or Aveeno or Aquaphor or other unscented products. But when I can handle scents, I like Philosophy's line, as it doesn't irk me like some skinwise. Between the more sensual Inner Grace and this crisper Pure Grace, I have shower gel/cream to cover a couple of my moods.For a cream, this lathered exceedinly nicely on my washcloth. I felt very clean--well, duh, it has a strong cleanser--but also moisturized somewhat, which is nice.Not everyone is gonna love this scent. Some might find it on the sharp side, on the Zesty soapy side, but it fades quickly, like all other Philosophy bath scents. Layering only helps slightly. Dunno why, but Philosophy scents just don't have "hold." But that's okay. Smells so nice while you're showering.One star off cause this is rough on fragile/color-treated/dry hair. Only use on your tresses if you have tough hair that you want clarified.But I would rebuy just the same. Nostalgia is a potent thing.Enjoy,

I have so many knives from the cheapo to the pricey in my kitchen, it's not funny. It's like that hoarding show, but in a knife situation. But lately, I just keep grabbing three for my uses, and this is one of them. This little serrated knife just cuts well for those small tasks that accumulate in a day's worth of kitchen duty. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, etc, the things that can be small annoying tasks with some knives, ya know?It makes me happy to use it. The handle is so comfy (I have an arthritic thumb, so I appreciate the way it's designed).Lovely. Love it. Want another!!!

I grew up using cheap slant tweezers for grooming brows. I rarely bothered. Until I hit my middle years and then, well, I wanted better groomed brows. I invested in a pair of Tweezerman points and never looked back. Now that I'm older and have sparse eyebrows, i don't need to pluck a lot, but I still buy these when they need to be replaced (or the Rubis point, also good) to take care of the excess hair that seems to show up at menopause. I may not have bushy eyebrows, but these help me pluck the slightest hairs and ingrown hairs and keep my browline very neat. I even use them on facial hairs (forehead, temple, upper lip).Good quality. And if you use one of those high magnification mirrors, you can end up with a really clean look around the eyes that makes you look BETTER. Shaped eyebrows make such a difference.Note that if you have shaky hands, this is not the one for you. The point is sharp and you have to be CAREFUL.Enjoy.

If you like comic books, Shakespeare, and Pop TV, and if you like a spiritual theme in your genre fiction, you're going to have fun with the story of a tormented Hit Man who meets his Damascus Road when he takes out a true-believer preacher. Allusions and echoes of King Lear, Macbeth, Julius Caesar (loved his use of an iconic scene and utterance) abound. There is clearly an homage to Raymond Chandler, too. At least, that's what The Mir thinks.What happens when someone who's had a messed-up childhood and vicious adulthood comes face to face with a logic-defying human act of benevolence? Well...when God intervenes, you cannot remain the same. Forgiveness of this sort, of the kind Corrie Ten Boom--holocaust survivor-- offered a Nazi, of the kind some Rwandans offer the killers of their kin, of the kind the parents of murdered children offer some death row inmates...the kind Christ offered from the cross. This is not a power one can dismiss lightly. This novel follows one man's life-and-soul changing encounter with forgiveness.A book doesn't have to be perfect to be enjoyable. I give this 4 1/2 stars in terms of technique, because there is a pacing issue and less emphasis on the snappy style toward the latter part, and here and there I hit some rather jarring jumps in POV (from third to omniscient and back) that will irritate those of you who are POV purists. (I know many of y'all, so if you're one, calm down. Buy the book. Enjoy it.) Those are really very minor quibbles. The start and middle of the novel are entirely crisp and snappy and energetic and wholly enjoyable. The ending is awesome. I give it 5 stars in terms of premise and style and freshness. This is some good writing!Other reviewers have told you about the story--neighborhood anti-crime effort, cops trying to break the local mob, a hit man taking out activists, a detective with marital woes and a big "don" to bring down, treason of various sorts, mayhem and self-discovery. I just want to tell you to buy this book and read it now, because Chris Well has another one coming out this year, and you really want to enjoy this debut novel before his next one hits the shelves.This is a CBA author to watch. He's got a blog you might want to check out (especially if you're interested in Christian fiction in general) at http://chriswellnovelist.blogspot.comAnd, if I recall correctly, this book was chosen as one of the Top Ten Booklist Christian Novels of the year. Not too shabby.Mirhttp://mirathon.blogspot.com

While FORGIVING SOLOMON LONG was a fine read, and I recommend it, this follow-up goes a few steps beyond. It's smoother, I think, in structure. It's got a big funny bone around its criminally dark heart.I like Chris' style. He uses fragments well and plays around with conventional POV for good effect. His chapters are brisk and short and move things along nicely. He must have taken note of complaints about loose ends in FSL--I wasn't complaining, btw, and I was satisfied with the conclusion-- cause this baby has multiple epilogues, from the touching to the outright hilarious. I suspect the whole tv cables things is some kind of wry metaphor . . .Chekov would be proud of Well's use of a particular "prop". Comic and film fans will enjoy references to some faves, including philosophical dialoging on the subject of comics and their readership. The spiritual content is pertinent; forgiveness and repentance are key issues, as they were in FSL.While one doesn't need to read FSL to follow the plot and characters of and enjoy DELIVER US FROM EVELYN, it sure is nice to catch-up with the detectives and see things change for them in certain ways.Others have provided a synopsis of the plot, but just so you know:Billionaire Warren Blake is missing. An anonymous blogger is writing about it--and her special relationshihp to the man--and she's also dropping hints that it's foul play. Mobsters of various factions are involved, making things a bit complicated. And Blake's egocentric, volatile, flighty, power-mad whackjob of a wife is looking mighty suspicious, even as she goads the political powers to put pressure on the police force to find her husband or solve the mystery of his disappearance. So, here come the good guys of the KCPD--the emotionally troubled Griggs, the pop-culture enthusiast Pasch, etc. Add in some weird goings on at a comics book store, and an inept and cowardly wiseguy who bungles every plan he makes, and you've cooked up a pretty cool bit of crime fiction.The pace is fast, the tension is delicious, and the humor gives it that extra pizzazz that makes this a keep-me-up-til-the-wee-hours read.I suggest you just buy it, enjoy it!Mir

EXPOSING THE DARK by Luminous is one of my fave albums in the last year. I acquired it in 2006, though I gather it came out the year before. I had never seen press for this group. No, I came across them through the tribute album for Wes King (a good tribute record whose profits go to a worthy cause, and I think you might wanna check it out).No here, is a record that gave me thrills, with a terrific lead vocalist. The band backs her up creditably (only occasionally almost drowning her out). Here and there, a moody piano plays. Here and there an echo of Coldplay. Here and there a touch of U2 guitar work.There is a gorgeous atmosphere here, young and fresh and earnest. The lyrics are thoughtful and emotional and spiritual.How did this album just fall below the radar and disappear? I mean, there are so many boring acts on Christian radio that I simply tune out, but a cool act like LUMINOUS just, what?, vanishes? It's perplexing.Ever since OUT OF THE GREY sort of faded away (and man, I loved that duo), I haven't come across a combination of artsy hipness and accessibility and cool lyrics like with LUMINOUS. (Okay, Barlow Girl is great fun, and Nichole Nordeman and Sarah Groves give us personal girl spiritual power. But BENJAMIN GATE went kaput, and CHASING FURIES went bye-bye, and this band finally fills the cool shoes of B.G. and C.F. for me, and I like them immensely.)Someone needs to get this band some airplay on CCM stations. They're just too good to disappear.If you like CCM with a more modern flair (ie not old-timey or dull and predictable the way praise music can be since it's intended for anyone to be able to sing), find this cd available, snap it up.Playlist:WHO AM I?--starts out with this interesting bit of clanky percussion then ramps up, then calms to allow Natalie to sing in a semi-rappy singing style. And the chorus rings out with passion: "Who am I to make up the rules, to judge anyone, when I'm the one to be judged?" 4.5/5FALLING FOR YOU--U2 homage in the opening, insistent bass drum, tinkly piano accents, and a low-key but not unemotional vocalizing. "You've changed my thinking, how I see myself...I'm starting over, I'm moving forward...I'm falling for you...I feel I'd do anything, even go anywhere with you by my side, my dreams are awakened, chances must be taken...Chances must be taken..." 4.5/5BURN--My favorite song on the album. I'll wail this one around the house on REPEAT: Opens with some nice cymbal moody tinkling and atmospheric guitar work rising, falling. Then a bouncy tune with some interesting echo and buzzing. A cool driving/strolling sound...then Natalie: "Burning with love is the fire I feel for you, undying passion through and through. Melting, mending, changing me to gold: I willingly submit instead of being told. Stir this fire in my soul. Stir up the coals of indecision. Break through the icy chains that have held me down. And I'll burn for you... I wanna burn for You. I wanna burn so hot that my enemies will turn..." 5/5UNAWARE: Not one of my faves. Bouncy, a touch of electronica, another nice strolling sound, but the vocals are a bit tired feeling. Only the chorus really is fun to me: "They look, they stare, totally unaware of who I really am..." But it gets much better toward the finale, the vocals get some life. 3/5CHOOSE: Spare opening and vocals with a touch of ennui: "Echoes of my past they haunt me to say, it's just another day. Nothing's new. You never change...I have a choice. I choose You now." Unfortunately, in spots, we lose her voice... 4/5THINK: This feels very girl-power-pop. Energetic drumming, super bouncy rhythm. It makes me want to put on a mini-skirt and do a New Wave jump. Good energy, good vibe, a bit more of the "lost voice" issue, but youth groups could love this. "One life to live...once chance to give...Generations come and go..." 3/5EMOTIONS: Sassy stop-and-go, hip-hop manipulations with a slower tempo. "You're everything to me. The only one that stays the same through it all. In this battle, you call my name. Let me know you're love's the same." 4/5ON AN ON: Clanky percussion opener moves into an atmospheric geography, some techno touches, very light, but add a nice accent. The vocals are clearer, and the guitar comes in nice and unhurried, strum, strum. Layered vocals come in and it grows into a pleasant, moody piece. "Your love goes on and on when I see the darkness all around, your love goes on and on and on despite my circumstances." The guitar does some nice bits later on, too. Never getting in the way. They did a great job of setting a mood that feels like a long, long horizon..on and one and on. 5/5AT THE WELL:Okay, I kept expecting Elton John to start singing. Piano playing a repetitive set of chords, then a simple: "How can this be, that you're in love with me?" Just a sort of interlude. About a minute long. 3/5EPILOGUE: Nice moody piano opening, sort of like a suspenseful set of notes. "Can't take what I've done back, the weight is heavy but I"ve got to move on and repent, not resent, I'll repent, not resent..." She does a great job of singing the chorus, and that continual set of piano notes carries on this sort of driving sense of a need. That suits the lyrics. This is another of my faves, though the arrangement is sort of minimal, it does wind up towards the end--guitars rushing in, drums waking up--and is just a cool song, period, with a great message. 5/5SPEECHLESS: INSTRUMENTAL: piano with some nice strings accompanying. Feels like a piece of a nice film soundtrack.SEARCH ME: A fabulous praise song. Piano is clean, nice and vocals are earnest: "I bow low in Your presence, in the holiness of Your throne room. You gently lift my chin as I gaze into Your eyes." "Search me, O God, and know my heart. Test me and know my thoughts, so I'm set apart. Shine your light on me, and set me free. Let nothing hold me back from knowing You." "I submit my life to you. My dreams, my questions, my heart to you. You gently grab my hand, and you smile at me, you're in control." The piano is gorgeous. And toward the latter half, a bit of guitar strumming comes into play, and there is a crescendo with strings, just before it gets mellow again. But the piano and voice rule the day. Perfect for any worship gathering. Beautiful, full of longing. 5/5LUMINOUS has a MySpace page that offers some of their songs for your enjoyment. They also have an webpage. I really hope they put out another album and become better known among CCM enthusiasts.Big thumbs up.Mir of Mirathon blog

What Reynholm Industries actually creates or produces or sells is a mystery, but what the IT department of Reynholm Industries produces is terrific comedy led by a talented trio playing Jen, Roy, and Moss (ably assisted as the show progresses by whomever is the head of Reynholm in this first season, and that's all I'll say about that). You will laugh your head off at the nerdy way of things.The players: Jen, the "dynamic go-getter" whose idea of lots of computer experience (a nice little fib at her job interview) is turning the computer on and off, sending and receiving email, rinse, repeat. In other words, zip qualifications to work as the manager of IT, the department exiled to the nearly windowless squalor of the basement. She gets the job all the same.The IT department's tech-savvy workers are Roy and Moss. Roy is Irish and Moss has a guffaw-inducing strictly parted afro. They're consummate nerds (look at the posters, the t-shirts, the games they play, the social awkwardness). But with Jen at the help as the "people person" to buffer for the non-people people that are Roy and Moss, a team gels that continues to fall into mishaps that ensure laughter.Trust me, the show is way, way better than my encapsulation. Moss is my particular fave. In series one, the episode where he has to lie is a hoot. My fave Moss-mess in this series is the fire episode. He's wonderful in his lack of practical knowledge. In later series, he just keeps getting funnier and more clueless about practical, non-IT matters.Jen, though not a nerd, is hilarious in other ways (the SHOE episode!), as well as offering an earnest ambition and likability.Roy is hot-tempered and feisty and will make you chuckle at his frustration at the computer illiteracy of others. His standard answer of "Did you try turning it on and off?" and "Are you sure it's plugged in?" will be a running gag for a few episodes, but in fresh ways.Nerds rule comedically here, and you'll love their antics. Brits manage to be goofy and funny BUT smart, too. And this is another beloved Brit-Com to add to the list. My hubby, a software engineer, likes the little in-jokes that can be found in the accessories (posters, knick-knacks, t-shirts).Each set/series has six episodes. In series one you have:Yesterday's Jam--Jen is hired as manager, and the guys want her gone on the grounds of her not knowing squat about IT. But people skills count for something, yes?Calamity Jen-- the shoes episodes. My husband and I nearly had laugh-induced strokes over the emergency number (the Brit version of 911). OMIGOSH, I won't ruin it for you, but it's dangerously funny.Fifty-Fifty--bad date/dating episode. "Poop" on the forehead, too.The Red Door--Roy is trapped under a desk with two female employees sitting on either side. No escape! And the wonderful Richmond (goth hilarity ensues) is discovered in the basement.The Haunting of Bill Crouse--Jen is in avoidance mode, and Moss, bad at lying, panics and tells everyone she's dead. Heh.Aunt Irma Visits--the IT boys are affected by Jen's monthly cycle. It becomes and epidemic of sympathetic PMS among nerds.Supreme Thumbs Up! And just think, you have two more seasons to look forward to. Long live the IT CROWD.

Note: This review may contain what you consider spoilers. Skip if that doesn't float your review boat--Yesterday, I caught a film from 2002, French with subtitles, called Le Temps Du Loup: THE TIME OF THE WOLF.It's a difficult film to watch, but I found myself utterly engrossed. There is no way I could turn off this film after the harrowing opening scene grabbed me completely:A family of four, the Laurents, drive to their country home--mom, dad, son, daughter. Upon entering their cottage, they find that another family is squatting there: a man, his wife, and a boy. They are grim-faced and the man raises his rifle to the Laurents. As Mr. Laurent tries to be reasonable, speaking calmly, offering to share his food and water with the family, to work something out, the squatter shoots Laurent. We see blood splatter on the wife's face, played by Isabel Huppert.The squatters take the supplies and cast the woman and children off with only a can of juice, some biscuits, what they are wearing and carrying in the mother's purse, and a bicycle.Then we see the stricken woman-who is clearly in shock--visit the magistrate. He refuses to help--Don't you know what's happened? he says--and tells her to go away. Closes his door on the bereaved threesome. They knock on neighbor's doors in the village. None will open to her.We know something is very, very wrong. She knows their names. They've been her neighbors for years. But none will let them in out of the cold night.Yes, something is wrong, very wrong.This is a film in the tradition of the post-apocalyptic story. Some sort of plague has hit this country (seems like France, but one could assume the wider world is stricken, at minimum Europe). Water is scarce. Food supplies are not moving as they used to. Animals are affected and being burned. Hunger is rampant. Trains don't stop for passengers.And now this family must find a way to survive without supplies, in the cold, without their Pater Familias, and with a terrible grief to bear.It's enough to break your heart, this chilling opening.The story follows them as they meet up with a filthy, feral youth--a boy who is a loner, who steals to survive, who will not join up with a group, but lives in the woods in solitary suspiciousness and pessimissm. The misanthropic survivalist. Then they meet up with a quarrelsome group at a train station. They hope a train will come. (At this point, it starts to feel as if WAITING FOR GODOT has become a horrifying sci-fi story, because we can only wonder if a train ever WILL come, and if they wait in vain.)Terrible things are done. Amazingly kind things are done. Hope is minimal, but not completely lost. Some people try to keep things civilized, to be fair. More terrible losses are in store.I watched, mesmerized, horrified. I wondered: What would I do with MY back against the wall? Would I be like the kinder folks, and would I comfort and share? Or would I be one of the "me and mine" folks, and cast out the wanderer for pragmatic and selfish reasons? Would I withhold water from a thirsting woman or child today, just to be able to give it to my own tomorrow? Would I succumb to survival of the fittest or the cruelest or the one with the biggest rifle?I hope not. I hope that grace will abound. That this film made me stop and consider my own soul, well, that tells me it's powerful and worthy.But I do NOT know the anwer. I do not comfort myself with thinking I will be among the great and giving righteous on that day. I can only pray I will.Part of the ongoing imagery in story and action and dialogue in the film harkens to the idea of the 35 Righteous of Jewish legend. Those 36 people who, by virtue of being on the planet and being of such goodness, that they keep the world from being destroyed. (Think of the story of Abraham's pleading for Sodom, how God could not really destroy a city with even TEN righteous souls in it, would he?)And as if to prove that there is something to this, we see a woman bring a bit of warm goat milk to a very old man, who in turn takes not one sip, but gives it ALL to his frail wife, who drinks it up in silence, him holding the bowl to her lips.And we see a woman offer to give up her bicycle, another to give up his watch, to get water for a woman with nothing left to trade except sex.And we see an addled, shocked, silent boy ready to make the ultimate, horrific sacrifice if it will save the world.Even in the midst of the selfish and murderous and quarrelsome, a few lights shine.The movie is named after an era spoken of in Norse legend, the wolf-age, the time of the wolf. The age that precedes the end of the world. These lines are from the Norse poem VOLUPSA:Brother will fight brother and be his slayer,brother and sister will violate the bonds of kinship;hard it is in the world, there is much adultery,axe-age, sword-age, shields are cleft asunder,wind-age, wolf-age, before the world plunges headlong;no man will spare another.These words are compatible with what we read in the eschatalogical writings of Judaism and Christianity. (Perhaps Islam, too, but I am not as familiar with those texts.)I was very moved by this dark and depressing film, and grateful that the director gave us some light in the darkness, the light that came through acts of generosity and selflessness, no matter how scarce when catastrophe and chaos comes.If you can bear it, I recommend LE TEMPS DU LOUP/THE TIME OF THE WOLF. It's not easy to watch, but I think there are lessons there worth viewing, and some very good scenes. And Isabel Huppert is, to me, always a delight to watch.~Mir~

This is a very nice, versatile item in Jyoti's lineup. I had this for lunch today with a peas/carrot/corn organic veggie combo mixed in, and it was tasty and filling.Here's my opinion: The heat/hotness level (ie, the heat) is about mediumish. Maybe a bit to the mild side of medium. But it does have some heat, so know that. It's got good spicing, so it packs a flavor punch. There is a lovely creaminess, a thick creaminess, so you can water it down (as I do) to make soup or you can leave it thick to pour over rice or use naan to sop it up.My only critique is that the dumplings are not very dumplingey as I have previously experienced "dumplingness". They are, if I had to describe the texture/taste, like tiny baked potatoes. As if you cooked dumpling sized potatoes to a nice soft-firmness. But that's it. Like chunks of potato, not like dumplings (which I've had as airy and as chewy, depending).Since this is essentially just the potatoes and spiced milky-creamy base, you can vary this in many ways by adding meats, veggies, thinning with milk or water, or topping with crispy bits (baked pita, croutons, etc) or bacon or cheese. Very versatile. This would totally rock with chicken pieces and peas, which is what I'll be making next with the Karhi. I will also try with spinach mixed in.For those watching their weight, this whole can is less than 300 calories worth of damage. :) And each serving has 70 calories (a can is four servings).This is the second Jyoti product offered on Amazon that I've tried. I think both are quite nice, and I will try their lentils with vegetables next. A high quality canned/convenience food for those who like Indian cuisine.

Unless you just get a kick out of--1. sweeping, windy, frigid landscapes with a sort of terrifying beauty2. modern revisionism that updates a classic adventure tale's meaning3. extremely attractive Northern European he-males--you may wanna skip Beowulf.And yet...and yet, I suggest you try it, even though I was less than blown away.Why?Well, certainly number one above. Visually, this film takes you someplace stunningly cool (metaphorically, not just literally), an environment so bleak in spots and so callous in others and so apathetic to human suffering, that it's a fitting background for this stark tale of revenge and bloodshed and loss and heroics and loyalty. A cold wind surely does blow, outside and inside the soul.Also, you may enjoy the revisionist take. Grendel is now the terribly injured party dealing with a sort of bigotry for his "monsterhood": He and his kind are hated for being different, ugly, smelly, not evil. (I believe, if memory serves from the long-ago high school reading, that Grendel did represent evil, and not merely a symbol of aggrieved minority.)And almost certainly you will enjoy the charisma of actor Gerard Butler. That man is good. He can act--see THE JURY or PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or DEAR FRANKIE or even CRADLE OF LIFE to see how he can inhabit various types of roles and make them come to life with that combination of personal magnetism, vocal expression, facial expression, body language and just plain emotive power. I have no idea why this man is not a huge, huge star. He's got everything it takes, the complete package of ridiculous good looks and acting chops and versatility. He can be funny or menacing or romantic or so vulnerable you weep. Perhaps 300 will do it for him in 2007.As to the others: Stellan Skarsgaard is dependably good as an actor, if not always top-notch. He's good here, definitely a man chased by a Gredelian fury for his bloody deed long ago. Sarah Polley is less effective as the witch, and yet not totally ineffective. She simply was miscast. (She was terrific in THE SWEET HEREAFTER and I liked her in GO! and know she can act. It's just not a good fit for her, this role.)Still, at the end of the day, Gerard Butler and the marvelous landscape are the two reasons to buy or rent or just borrow this DVD. Two potent forces of nature--Iceland and Butler--do manage to make a somewhat lackluster movie work in spots.Bottom line: Try it, because parts of it work. And if you're a Gerard Butler fan, buy it, because he is a gift to cinema and quite easy on the eyes and ears. And if you can't travel to a high Northern wilderness, but kind of want to, visit a remote and windy spot with BEOWULF & GRENDEL.

I have been using this lately as a hand soap in the kitchen, and I always look forward to the wonderful burst of scent that I can best describe and "perky, bright, and clean". It's neither floral or purely herbal. Have no idea what the classification of the scent is, but I love it.And I love how my hands aren't red and itchy anymore. I wash my hands A LOT, dozens of times a day, so having something that's effective for cleaning but also gentle matters. I use a non-fragranced castile olive oil soap for my body, Cetaphil for my face, and this for general hand washing.And, since it's in the kitchen, I have occasionally squirted it on a sponge and washed cups with it or stinky lunch tupperware my hubby brings home. Works great for that, too.I ordered from a different site due to a better price over there, and I just reordered some yesterday. This will be a staple in my house.

If you could only see my hair. If you could feel it. If you had seen my hair without Hot Sauce.Okay, the low-down: I have very curly (think ethnic, curly, dry, coarse hair) long hair (past shoulders, but not uberlong). My thyroid disease makes it like STRAW in places, nasty and frizzy and rough.I've used some good products to try and give me silky control--Pantene anti-frizz is okay. BioSilk is lovely. And I thought I'd use BioSilk forever--love the scent, love the result.Then I bought a flat-iron (12/07) from FHI and I bought Hot Sauce to go with it. I used it and though, "Oh, huge waste of money" on the product. It just didn't do what BioSilk did.Then I decided to do something: Use twice as much as I had used. (The directions say use a small amount, so I used about the size of a nickel in my palm, which is what I'd use of BioSilk.) I used about a quarter's size or so. I was afraid it'd weigh my hair down and make it look oily or dirty.TOTALLY DIFFERENT UNIVERSE.I simply had not used the right amount for my very dry, very curly, very crazy hair. With a larger amount, I didn't even NEED the flatiron. No kidding. No styling lotion (I used to use Paul Mitchell). No hair spray. I just use the Hot Sauce, my 3 inch ceramic-ionic styling brush, and my ionic blow-dryer (not even a high-end model, a cheapie import). And my hair is silk. Pure silk. It's straight, except for a nice wave at the bottom part where there is some layering. It's smooth. It moves. It shines. I can't stop touching it.And my hairstyle lasted five days without frizzing or recurling. I just added a bit of BioSilk to my hair to add some smoothness and that lovely scent a couple days in. A retouching.I expect that come the humid months in Miami (it's winter now), that I'll need something for more control against the damages of summer moisture to curly hair, but for now, I can say this stuff rocks like nobody's business.My hair is BEEEEEEEEEEEEEYOTIFUL. And my husband loves how it feels. And I love how fast I can dry it without all the steps and styling products and flatironing it to get "silky".Big, big, thumbs up to FHI Hot Sauce. Worth the price tag.Mir&lt;--with silky hair at last

I rented this film a couple months ago through Netflix. The horrible lack of coordination between subtitles and the spoken voices was jarring. It actually RUINED what was a very nice flick. Imagine that you're reading subtitles that have a lag of 90 seconds or more, so that you're reading dialogue with the wrong person, or maybe the wrong SCENE. Very headache-inducing.Now, I don't know if this is a new edition, with better subtitles. I hope so, because this film deserves quality translation. The story--based on Sense and Sensibility, my favorite English language film, directed by Ang Lee--follows the romantic and financial difficulties of two sisters. I agree with the previous reviewer that the actor who plays the older suitor of the lovely Aish does a great job. I rooted so much for him (the Indian version of Col. Brandon). I wanted more of the film to focus on him and Aish. Ah, well.I enjoy Bollywood cinema. Like any nation's film industry, not everything is great, and a lot is just plain bad to mediocre. (If you don't believe me, rent a compilation of Bollywood music numbers from assorted films--you can rent these from Netflix if you dare not buy them from amazon without test driving-- and see how many of them really reek in terms of choreography, costumes and performance).This one is among the better Bollywood offerings I've seen. If you wish to compare my taste, I also loved (and excuse any misspellings as I try to recall foreign words) TAAL, VEER ZAARA, LAGAAN, HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM, and to a lesser extent MOHABBATEIN and DEVDAS (visually stunning film, musically enjoyable, with a maginificently "watchable" Aishwarya and a terrific Madhuri Dixit, a great number featuring both beautiful women, but the weak spot was Shahrukh, who was just not very good in this. I hated his creepy character and the seriously annoying overacting. Shahrukh has screen presence, and he's featured much better in DEVDAS, while still prone to a lot of weepy overacting, but in that context, much more heroic. He's also quite likable in MOHABBATEIN.)If they fixed the subtitle problems on this DVD, then I recommend this wholeheartedly.Mir

I love fairy tales--as a kid, as an adult. And I love the art of Kay Nielsen. I preordered this which would reprint one of the more well-known story collections illustrated by Nielsen.Pros: nice large font, the old stories themselves, the excellent art for the stories.Cons: poor binding, sticky pages, so stiff it's hard to wield the book; detail lost in the art reproductions.For the price paid, I won't complain. I paid $19, and I'm not gonna get a marvelously bound book with razor-sharp and large reproductions for that price. It's still enjoyable.Two stars off for 1. the poor feel of the binding and 2. the loss of detail in the size/quality of reproductions. Three stars for the 1. stories 2. Nielsen's visions 3. attractive and readable font.If you want the stories and a look at the artwork (and can't afford the originals, cause they're super-expensive even on ebay), here ya go. There's enjoyable stuff, but it's not gonna satisfy completely.Mir

I bought this game some years ago on the recommendation of a couple of families at my church. They claimed it was simple to learn (so almost everyone in the family could start playing at once) and it was the sort of game you could still chat and socialize while playing at your own pace. Also, most "hands" were over pretty quickly, so you weren't tied into some long, long undertaking (think Monopoly or think RISK). You could play a short while or long while.Basically, you have a board made up of card faces and you have chips (red, green, blue) that you use to mark the cards you set down (ie play). Your goal is to get five in a row (across, up and down, diagonally). There are also Jacks (one-eyed and two-eyed) that allow for a strategic removal or additon of a chip to the spot of the player's choice. That's where the real battle gets going. Do you remove from X player or Y player? Do you save your Jack for a last minute chip add for the win? Does the other player have multiple jacks, and what do you risk setting down?There are variations (double fives, for instance).Two or three players can play, or three teams can play, or whatever variation you can come up with given the pieces.My sisters, nieces, and I really enjoy it. And even the guys have had a good time with it.Strongly recommended for families who enjoy board games that give them the flexibility of time and sociability.Mir

The right person can help you overcome your self-destructiveness. That's pretty much the moral of this oddly endearing love story/crime story.The principal character--very strongly and naturally played by a not-at-all-inhibited Asia Argento (ie, lots of nudity). I was very impressed by the other main character, Jared Harris, an actor I had only seen previously as Andy Warhol (I Shot Andy Warhol). He's terrific. His voice is fabulous (something in common with dad, the late great Richard H.) He's a good guy, the clean-cut teacher who cares about his students, law-abiding, gentle, jazz-loving. She's the thief with a soft heart, looking for a reason to leave that life, looking for "family" (her childhood was not chipper). She's got an ersatz family (a dysfunctional one) with Rupert Everett (as a charming, drug-addled thief) and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as a pretty-boy, screwed up emotionally thief). They care about each other, but are also violent and volatile with each other.The teacher gets pizzazz in his life from Beatrice (B Monkey); B. gets stability from him. But the dark elements of her character and her dangerous associates intrude into their lovey-dovey life, and they have to make tough decisions about how to continue together. It's very moving when Harris' character asks Beatrice, "If if was just you and me, and nothing else, would that be enough?" Ultimately, isn't that what true love may come down to? Is being with that person, like Adam and Eve, just the two of you, enough? Can you give up the thrills of a dangerous life and settle down and be happy?The ending, violent and an ultimate test of loyalty and love, is explosive and appropriate given what came before. It's a satisfying, if gruesome conclusion to an askew love story.I've never seen Miss Argento before, and I agree with the other reviewers that she is genuinely charismatic.

Odd is so likable and we so want him to be able to overcome and be happy. But life is here to throw more wrenches in his way.Some spoilers if you haven't read Book One, Odd Thomas, which you should before reading this one.This is a good, if quieter and slower-paced read than ODD THOMAS. We still have Odd with his dead-seeing power and his good heart that wants to help, even if it puts him at risk. This time, rather than major bodach-thrilling carnage, we have someone Odd cares about deeply in trouble--kidnapped by one whack Voodoo-ish skanky beauty. Odd, we know (as the series continues) will overcome, but as in all things, it's the how, the pace, the suspense, the characters, the why that makes stuff interesting. Koontz can write, so that's not even an issue. Koontz can plot, so we know it will have escalating danger and a ticking clock.However, Mr. Koontz seemed a bit too enamored of his research material, and I found some of the detail overwhelming. It's like I wanted to say, "Enough about the tunnel already, or the hotel, or the this or the that." The amount of setting descriptive detail, while understandably some being needed for placing the reader in the situation, did feel excessive. I skimmed A LOT in spots.One quibble: If this Danny was such a dear, close, valuable friend, how come he was, like, not around in the first book? I know, I know, authorial license to add and enrich a character who continues in a successful series, but I had a hard time accepting this guy was like "a brother" when he's dumped on us out of the blue.In a novel that leaves us with an Odd with lots of time to reflect (as we read endlessly about some setting details), what shone for me in his ponderings was the seriousness of Odd asking some cosmic questions. Questions that evil makes us ask. I really thought Koontz did a great job of anchoring the metaphysical with the physical. He's great at metaphors, so no surprise. Anyway, by the end of this part of his story, Odd comes to some serious cosmic recognitions. As his writer pal says: He already knows. He must just recognize. After facing another example of human evil, Odd faces the truths he already knew. And that many of us readers know, too.By the end, he's ready for a different phase of life, a change, and so we'll go on with Odd to his next place and quest. He's a terrific character, one we can love and root for and one we wish to continue to learn about.This is a good read. This has some thrilling moments. This has some scary moments. This has some heartwarming moments. But the book is not as page-turningly paced as the first, and for those of us who really like to whip the pages...like me...one star off.

I picked up the novel this month because I enjoyed Miyazaki's film of it so much. I had read somewhere that the film didn't follow the novel exactly, so I wanted to see where the differences lay.As it turns out, I loved the differences in the novel (and the fleshing out of Sophie and her family situation). Each-film and novel--offer something a bit different, but essentially, it's the story of a cursed Sophie (the Witch of the Waste, beautiful in the novel, a strange and fat big-headed creature in the film), who is turned into an old woman by the jealous witch. Sophie wanders off, liberated by her new old body, and encounters Howl's castle, which, in fact, IS mobile, as well as able to open out to different parts of the land at the turn of a knob. Multi-locatory?The novel (like the film based upon it) is full of people who are under some sort of curse/spell--Sophie, Howl, Calcifer, the scarecrow. But the novel adds other characters, and in so doing, becomes more complex and more interesting for it.Eventually, as in all good fairy tales, things get sorted out. It's in caring about imperfect characters and the outcome of their trials that one has delight. Diana Wynne Jones employs a sort of blithe, even tongue-in-cheeky voice that is a delight to read. All age groups can enjoy this novel. (For concerned parents, no cussing or naughtiness, so it's a safe read.)One thing the movie had that the book doesn't--and that I actually really enjoyed in the movie--is the "beast" aspect for Howl (in the novel, he doesn't turn into a weird flying monster), and the "love thy enemies" and compassion that is bestowed on the Witch of the Waste. Wynne Jones doesn't turn the Witch soft and senile. So, as I said, there are merits to the anime interpretation, which allows for transformation of the more extreme sort and a kinder message of forgiveness.In the novel, family problems play a larger role, and so does the apprentice. Romance definitely colors the air. And Howl and Sophie both have growing up to do.It's a fine novel and a fine film, and both should give you great enjoyment. I recommend you get/watch/read both.Mir

Quick story snapshot~Begin with a neck-slashing murder, move to a hemorrhaging pregnant girl, who dies giving birth to a living baby girl covered in her mother's blood, and focus on the midwife who innocently takes the dead mother's diary (written in Russian)in an attempt to find the deceased's identity (so as not to bury her an unknown). The diary becomes the object that drives the midwife's journey into the dark world of the London Russian mob, where she connects with a stoic, formidable mob chauffeur played by Mortensen, who is not just a driver, we learn pretty fast. Human sex slavery, murder, loyalties, and betrayals all play their part before we find out the true nature of the various characters by film's end.I had this film sitting around waiting to be watched. I wanted to watch it for 1. Viggo 2. Naomi (both among my fave actors) and 3. due tot he good reviews.However, the reviews that emphasized gore and violence and "nekkidness" made me decide to wait for a day when a dark film wouldn't drag my mood down too badly. (Yeah, I can be really affected by films, from joyful to depressing.)I wish I had not waited. The darkness and evil and pain is balanced to a large degree by elements of good and light and courage. It's not a movie that ends happily, but it is a movie that ends realistically and with some hope. Hope that if people take steps to make things right, some things can be made...more right, if not fully right. And that is an ending that doesn't depress me, but makes me feel great respect for people who do step out of comfort zones or take difficult jobs to make the world better. Or just to save one child.It's the ending that I began with when I described to my husband how greatly this movie had appealed to me (and subsequently re-watched it with him). The climactic scene at the waterfront is so beautifully done--the acting has subtleties in body language and vocal tone (especially Viggo's, and I totally understand the Oscar nomination). The visual and editing--just so powerful and humane, even in the darkness and dirt and grit and horror of what has been and what could have been.I cannot stress how amazing Mortensen is. His appearance has been altered by tons of hair spray and gel and clothing and tattos. He moves his body and makes little movements with his head that feel..authentic. He moves as if his secrets cloak him. His accent seems quite, quite good (but not being Russian, I can't say for 100% if it is dead-on).Watts, who is normally such a scene-stealer, is a good match for him, but she doesn't reach his level here. Mortensen has simply absorbed this character too deeply, and he is much more interesting, nuanced, and haunted a character than Watt's. We can't look away when Viggo's Nikolai is onscreen. We are sure he will look ths way or that, tilt his head, smile just so, and give something away to us. Marvelous.The supporting cast (for it's all supportive when Viggo is on) does a great job, including Vincent Cassell's father-dominated, vulnerable-meets-arrogant, repressed gay mobster son. The scene where he blows up party balloons--wow. His face is so full of pain and anxiety and uncertainty and a host of emotions as he speaks to his little girl that we can momentarily forget just how criminal and unfeeling he can be in other circumstances, and in forgetting, sympathize.I also found rivetting the "made man" sort of scene, when the criminal leaders come to initiate Viggo--and the tattoos tell their story.As I said, the last few scenes--the waterfront, the double denouement (Viggo's, Naomi's), overlaid with the voice of the dead girl reading the same lines we heard her say in the opening scenes: Wow.And for those who like romantic tension, there is tons here. Viggo manages to be threatening looking and aloof and then, bam, he's connecting in the subtle ways with Naomi's character. It's a thrill to watch their scenes together because of the palpable attraction he gives off without being 'romance hero" obvious.I want to give a special kudo to the writer who places so much foreshadowing--in seemingly trivial acts, in phrases--from the very start that come to fruition beautifully as the film moves to its final moments.Cronenberg is a director who's entertained me in some films, annoyed me with others, grosssed me out with some. Now, with Eastern Promises, he finally made a movie that made me want to see it again...and a third time.Mir

I'm not really sure what the writer/director wants us to take away. I rarely feel that way after a film. This, however, is a hard, hard, hard film to watch. Here it is in a nutshell: Interlocking stories of people who are deeply miserable or harboring secrets, who all want to connect and BE happy, but just can't seem to fit in. And maybe that's the point--that none of us fully fit our ideal of happiness, that happiness is just a moment here or there and that it passes and our dark human condition won't be covered up for long. I'm not so cynical as to think joy and happiness are impossible. (I'm pretty darn happy a good deal of the time despite the occasional blows of life) This film, however, makes you wonder if your own life is undermined by what's going on in the life of people around you. In this film, the clean-cut "family guy" is a pedophile who, bit by bit, loses control and takes his desires beyond fantasy/masturbation to reality/rape. The character who thinks she has a perfect life is living a lie and doesn't know it until her world crashes down on her. The older couple are splitting up, and the man has become numb, so lacking in true feeling that sex is meaningless and the act of salting his food becomes a supremely nihilistic statement. The hopeful, wounded waif keeps being rejected at every turn, becoming the scapegoat for the misery of those around her. Rejection in all forms abounds. Pain in hideous variety. Horrors in assorted flavors. And you can't look away thought something in you says, "I shouldn't see this. Do I have to see this? I want to see something PRETTY RIGHT NOW, PLEASE!"Camryn Mannheim is oddly touching as a woman whose misery and isolation make her flip out at the moment of an unwanted and uninvited human connection. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays yet another misfit who can't make his life work. Jane Addams looks like a breeze could knock her over, she's so fragile. The pedophile makes you want to run criminal searches on all the adult males in your neighborhood who seem so "nice, quiet, hard-working."It's unrelenting.Watch this movie if you can empathize with an array of futile searches for happiness. Be prepared to be slapped in the face by the underbelly of several lives. I gave it four stars because it was masterfully done, not because I "really liked it"--because this is not a film you can like. Why then? Because it was impossible for me to look away or to turn it off and not know how it ended. Because I kept hoping for some ray of light to shine on these damaged people. If you think you're brave enough, see this. Happiness is rivetting, but oh-so horrible.And tell me if that last converation, those last uttered words don't leave you chilled to the center of your soul.

Yeah, yeah, I'm late to the party. It's not my fault. I've sat through so much crappy anime, that anything that smacks of "Japanese" and is "animated" makes me run out of the room.But, I got so many recommendations to see HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, that I caved. The film is based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones (familiar to fans of fantasy, most likely.)Glad I broke my "no anime" rule, too. Absolutely delightful film that I heartily recommend.In brief: Set in some Europeanish land that feels like the 19th century, where contraptions of odd sorts and magic coexist happily, this is the story of Sophie, a plain young woman who works making hats, and who, after a brief rescue from sludgy thugs by a very attractive blond fella (the wizard Howl), finds herself cursed by the Witch of the Waste (who still resents not being able to capture Howl's heart). The curse turns her into a very old woman. So, off Sophie goes to the wizard in hope of breaking the curse. In typical fairy tale fashion, she has spunk and is quite industrious and noble of heart--helping a scarecrow stuck in a thicket (who then follows her slavishly, bounce-bounce-bouncing along), entering Howl's castle and bargaining with the fire demon, beginning to tidy up, taking charge of the place. Sophie and Howl and Markl (the boy who assists Howl) and Calcifer (the fire demon who is dependent on Howl, and Howl on he, in some symbiotic curse) end up getting along and working to end a war incited by the disappearance of a prince. (It won't take much guessing to figure out who's the prince). In the end, solutons are found and a new "family" is created from the cursed and lonely folks of the castle.A truly happy and romantic, even, ending.The castle itself if hilarious and whimsical and a joy to behold in action. The sort of thing I'd have given a few toes and fingers to ride in as a kid. The story has a generous and good heart, if you pardon the pun. (You'll get the pun if you see the film.) One young woman's selflessness and courage makes life better for a whole lot of people, breaking curses left and right. People don't always get what they deserve, interestingly. They do get compassion and grace and mercy. The idea of the longing for family is at play as well, and family may not be flesh-folk, but folk who band together and live together and make a life where they help and get help from one another, and where they put up with each other's moods, flaws, and eccentricities.Good theme, that.And if you like to laugh, Billy Crystal will make you...er...HOWL as Calcifer, the fire demon. I laughed my wee head askew.Christian Bale adds something extra to the character of Howl, the tormented wizard. A weariness, a masculinity, a strength, a bit of humor. I really like Bale (he was the best Batman on film!), and while I didn't recognize the voice during the flim and had to check the credits, I kept thinking, " I know that voice. I know that voice!" He was perfect for the part.For those who love a Beauty and the Beast type tale, this has that, too.And I recognized at once the voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer, but it took me a while to place Lauren Bacall, who does the Witch of the Waste perfectly, even after the character undergoes a rather startling transformation. (Oh, you're gonna love it.)From what I've read about Academy Award winning animator, Hiyao Mayazaki, he's a gifted man with the knack of adding a special magic to his creations. His work has brought him great honor and success in his homeland (and globally) for films such as MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, NAUSICAA: The Valley of the Wind, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY and others.Howl's Moving Castle is sprinkled with some of that magic.

While I don't eat any particular diet plan, I have lost 40 pounds over the years working in organic raw foods, lots of vegetarian meals, low carb phases to kick the sweet tooth, etc. I never stick to any one thing, though, but I do count calories. I've tried so many, assorted protein powders--Designer Whey, Melaleuca's brand, BSN, ProtiDiet, WonderSlim, EAS, Myoplex, MetRx, and a bunch over the years that I've totally fogotten-- and some are cloying, some bitter, some weird tasting, some tasty but hard to mix, etc. Since I like doing a protein-antioxidant blend of products for my pre-workout breakfast to keep reflux at bay when I'm upside down or curling up in Pilates (ie, putting pressure on the intestines, abdomen), a liquid breakfast works best for me. AND...for when I am hungry between meals, I like protein shakes/mixes, too.However, so many of them are loaded with weird stuff or have a ton of calories.This one by Solgar I decided to try after reading the recent Consumer Reports article on contaminated protein powders. I also was happy that its NOT SOY BASED. (I am not euthyroid, so I'd rather eat my soy than drink it, as I like tofu, and I need to watch my soy intake.)It has a very light texture and taste--very light nice vanilla, not cloying, not "trying to be like a sweet milkshake" taste. Mixes up perfectly in a shaker cup (no sticking-to-bottom bits or clumped floaters). Goes down easy and fast. No aftertaste. This is a perfect high-protein base for me to add my own additives (fruit, yogurt, raw organic cacao powder, whatever I want.)And how nice that I'm not getting dosed with cadmium, lead or arsenic, like with some of the other brands I've tried that the report highlighted as dangerous. (If you're drinking Muscle Milk, BSN, Jillian Michaels, etc, you need to check into this.)I will definitely repurchase. I also bought the chocolate, which I plan to have tomorrow. Wish they had a strawberry one, but I'm willing to check out the berry blend, and, really, it's easy enough to toss in a blender with some frozen strawberries. :DFor folks doing low-carb shake-based plans, like WonderSlim or MediFast, I think you could save some bucks using Whey to Go for your shakes. The protein/carb/fat is workable for those plans.Be well, enjoy....

Softwalk makes some really nice shoes for folks with fasciitis and other foot issues that mean we need cush or our tootsies ache and swell. I have several pairs of SoftWalks--a sanda/mule and three pumps. None fit the same, even though I'm a 10D in almost all shoes out there.If SoftWalk could fix their fitting issues, life would be so much easier. Even so, I recommend them if you order/shop with a vendor who has free return shipping so you can try the next size up, down, wider as needed. Don't take a chance on a no-free-return vendor, or you'll be ticked if you need to resize.On these, they fit me at 10W, my normal size. Perfectly. No pinching, none of the notorious heel-slippage for which this brand is known (ie, you buy your size, but find the heel slips off as if it were just a scosh too long). In general, I've bought SolfWalk in a HALF SIZE down. Not these. These require your size, maybe a wider, maybe a half size longer. Only you can judge. But taking the time to find the right size is worth it cause 1. these are majorly cute, especially in the shiny patent leather and 2. the trademark egg crate cushion is exhilirating to achey soles. Oh, my. So nice.On the non-strap model fo these (ie, they look just like this but aren't Mary Janes, I forget the name), I need a half size down. They were too large. Same with the MontClair, which was too large, but needed more width (ie, I could have gone with a WW). I got the mules in 10W and they were fine, but then again, they are open, so there is more leeway.SoftWalk hasn't really nailed their sizing, but they do make a cute and comfy line of shoes (not all, but some), and are worth getting to know and working around, especialy if, like me, your feet are really a weak spot and need babying when it comes to footwear.Also, take note, that these are fixed straps. They have a bit of stretch to get you in there, but you do slip our foot in, as opposed to velcro-ing or buckling the strap on. If you have a very swollen/large top-of-foot, this may be a problem.Be patient and you'll be rewarded. Enjoy.

Sometimes, it's best NOT to tell your child to go off and count windows and doors. Really, best to play with them yourself and prevent them from finding THAT DOOR, the one that opens with that old, black, rusty key, the door that leads to a brick wall.Or does it?Gaiman clearly has something of an obession with doors/passageways/mirrors/openings to other realities. (NEVERWHERE, for instance, or MIRRORMASK, for example.) In this not-very-long story, an adorably intrepid child who doesn't like fancy "gourmet" fare and has the heart of an explorer finds that some doors lead places they ought not, and, sometimes, you have to be very brave indeed. . . if you want to get your life back.Coraline's adventure in the Other-House with the chilling Other Mom and the not-quite-right Other Dad and a very savvy cat without a name is spooky and fascinating and absolutely great fun. There are bits that will bring up reminiscences of other stories, older stories.Gaiman knows what he's about when he tells a scary, fantastical tale about saving lives (of more than one sort), saving deaths (and yes, that can be done), and battling a Big Bad with Button Eyes who "loves you very much."And when you can really see your life, your world, and your parents as they truly are, you may find they're quite lovely, after all. And when you find out what you yourself are capable of...everything changes.There's a nifty moral in this niftier story.Now, remember to be nice to cats and eccentric old biddies and to keep your magical stone close by.

I've ordered Method foaming wash twice. The first time it was the blue-tinted Eucalyptus Mint. (Gorgeous color). It had a scent that I thought would work well for both my hubby's and my bathrooms (not too girly, fresh).This time, I wanted one without dyes, so I got the Sweet Water, hoping it would have a "unisex" sort of scent. Water is neutral, right?No, it doesn't. I'd put this scent squarely in the "gentle floral" department. It's a clean, feminine scent that's not overwhelming. I keep one bottle in the kitchen and one in my bathroom.The foaming action is great (I reuse the bottles, putting other shower or hand soaps in there, diluting a bit with water, and getting them to foam up this way.) These make nice gifts in baskets witih other personal products, cause the bottle's shape is attractive.It's not inexpensive. You can get handwashes for a LOT LOT less. But this one smells wonderfull, doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin, and the bottle is pretty. I like the colorless one as it matches any room's decor.I'd reorder this. For sure. As long as amazon offers a discounted price and PRIME shipping.Mir

This is currently my second favorite musk. I'm a big lover of white musks (though the ones saturated with vanilla tend to make me gag). It's a very gentle, clean, white musk that doesnt' last very long on me, sadly-given the price for less than 2oz. But, when I simply must have a super clean, airy musk, I reach for this.I prefer the beautifully, gentle, somewhat floral, slightly warmsy-woodsy scent of the LEs Bain Du Marais musc blanc better (that one doesn't last on me, either, whether the huile or the soin or both combined). I'll take the LBduM over the Serge Lutens any day. It's one of my fave fragrances on the planet. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find it anymore. So, this one will have to satisfy me until I can find one comparable to the LBdM Musc Blanc.If you are a lover and seeker of clean, pretty musks-here you go. It feels almost like a too-simplistic musk when you spray it on, but I find it wears very, very prettily.This IS an office appropriate musk, unlike some of the "sexier, dirtier" ones. This one makes you smell like you're clean and feminine.

I've had this novel sitting in one of my many to-be-read piles for more than a year. I knew McMaster Bujold could write well from her Vorkosigan books. I simply am easily distracted by something new.I regret not reading it sooner. This is a truly marvelous novel of one man's journey through tremendous difficulties and how those woes are redeemed, ultimately, for the good of many. And if you are tired of SF novels not dealing with matters of spirituality in any depth--a lack that is shameful given how very religious humankind has always been and likely always will be--you will find this a truly satisfying exploration of faith, loss of faith, prayer, curses, blessings, fate, free will and divine intervention. It's also a novel that, while dealing with religion, doesn't sneer or cast ministers or saints in an sarcastic or demeaning light. It takes the subject quite seriously and explores it without the arrogance that a secular elite can cast on it. It takes the "what if" of this religion being truly existent and says, "Now, how does this work out in a cursed kingdom with a man who's suffered about as much as he can humanly take?"Whom the gods choose is not always a happy camper. (Think of all the martyrs of various religions.)The fantasy setting: A medievalish, fortress and castle filled world akin to Spain/Portugal several hundred years ago, where reilgion is part of civil and royal life, where saints are acknowledged as god-touched, and where a curse has come upon a royal line due to a cataclysmic event during a previous time of warfare.The protagonist: Lupe dy Cazaril, an honorable man and brave soldier of gentlemanly lineage who had been betrayed in warfare, resulting in a tour of galley slavery (think Ben Hur-ish oaring for one's enemies). He is damaged in body and humbled, but his nobility of spirit and wisdom and unselfishness and wits are intact. You will root for this character, and perhaps, like me, weep for him, too.The situation: Through a chain of events, Cazaril comes back to his home town and is engaged as tutor to the royesse (a princess), whose brother is heir to the throne. Terrible events have fallen and continue to befall this cursed family, and Cazaril, who feels great loyalty and comes to love his charges and his patrons, becomes inextricably entangled in the intrigue and plots (supernatural and human), while himself a target of those who originally wished him dead and caused his slavery, the two most powerful men in the land of Chalion, barring the ruler himself. Court intrigue abounds. Cazaril must use all his powers of observation and intelligence, and all his courage and endurance, to seek and accomplish the liberation of his beloved charges from dangers of curse and plotters.I don't want to say much beyond that, since the pleasure of the novel is in the reading and the roads taken. I"ll let you walk those roads unspoiled.What I will say is that as a devout Christian, I thoroughly enjoyed the spiritual world McMaster Bujold has created. You get a sense of a religion drenched, god-observed world, and how that can bring great dangers (heresies are punished in just as cruel ways as history records), and obedience and selflessness are as powerful as a Christian would expect. The religion is certainly not Christianity (five gods of both attributed genders, various sexual preferences acceptable), but the echoes of a Roman Catholic religion is there in the sanctuaries, devouts, pilgrimages, saints, miracles, etc. And the idea of the chosen ones of god is there: One person's virtue can make a huge difference to his circle of influence, as it does here. And the climactic scene is so beautifully and simply depicted (no excess of prose, no over-the-top language pyrotechnics), that it allows us to feel the lightning-fast and world-altering moment as participants, without clutter, with just wonder. It's magnificently achieved.Cazaril is one of my fave characters ever. A man we'd all like to know, a man we'd all love to see in the corridors of power-someone who puts the good of others above his own good, someone who acts with total purity of heart, wise and generous and humble.I can't wait to get into the second book in this series, PALADIN OF SOULS, which follows the adventures of one of the cursed and redemption-needy characters from this novel.I cannot recommend it highly enough. A novel that rewards the reader who is patient and observant during the slower-paced opening.

I'm not a snacker. I like three square meals. But because I have insulin resistance (pre-diabetes), I was pretty much told firmly I had to have something every 2-2.5 hours to keep my blood sugar steady. Protein powders were recommended (low carb ones).This one is the best of the various I've tried. It mixes well with water. The flavors are not hideous (I've tried some that made me gag and retch). In fact, the strawberry and vanilla are quite pleasant. The chocolate is so-so.One scoop and I've got my protein and am done. 17 grams of protein at a go. That's excellent. Very low carb. Nice. Doesn't make my blood sugar go wacky.If you've got Metabolic Syndrome or insulin resistance or even diabetes, and you don't dig those bars or want to stop to fix a mini-snack with protein and whatnot between meals, this is a terrific solution. And it's not expensive. Stir in water and you're done!Recommended.

I wish I was someone who could tolerate this, as I've heard good things about results using Natrol Carb Intercept. However, this gave me the worst case of gas ever. I had that gurgling, uncomfortable internal distress. My tummy felt bad. My guts were in turmoil. And thank God it was during the night--ALL NIGHT--or I wouldn't have had the nerve to step outside my door with that much gas rolling around and erupting.I tried it again, just in case it wasn't the Natrol and was something else. Eating different foods--same result. Gasorama.Bummer.

If you've been looking for a great red--not blue, not orange, not too bright, very feminine and alluring, try "Romance."I ordered two of the Styli Style L3 timeless colors--ROMANCE and ETERNAL FLAME. I thought Eternal Flame would be more coral, but it's an orangish-reddish shade that makes me think "redheads." It brightens the face a lot, but a little more orangey than I love.ROMANCE, however, has not disappointed. I love it. It's not as bright as the color in the amazon photo. It's a deeper, warmer red (another reviewer called it brick, and maybe that's a good way to say it). But it goes on very smoothly with excellent coverage, beautiful pigment, and with my almost black hair and Latina skin tone (NC44 in MAC, for those who follow that), it looks AMAZING!If you want a great red color for a great price (I mean, I've paid 2 and 3 times for red lipsticks that didn't feel this good or look this good), try ROMANCE. Just lovely. I feel so glamourous with this on my lips--and I have tons of red lipsticks--not counting my bounty of glosses-- including four by NARS, seven by MAC, two by Kevyn Aucoin and a zillions by Revlon and L'Oreal and Iman and Almay and etc. For the price, this is an amazing "red lip" deal. The smooth application and non-sticky feel reminds me of Kevyn Aucoin lipsticks. It's a nice feeling on the mouth. Minimal feathering, too, which is important for a middle-aged gal like me.I'm gonna buy a spare. :)Mir

Now that the release of book two in the Chaos series is due out in a mere matter of weeks, I'd like to post a review to encourage y'all to buy this one and pre-order the second, FUGITIVES OF CHAOS, so that you can then spend a year yanking your hair out wondering what happens next and what wonders will unfold.Let's just say that Homer got reincarnated as a hot chick who met up with a younger Roger Zelazny (say, round the freaky seventies) and their love child is John C. Wright. Oh, and John Norman sent them a naughty and metallic baby shower gift, which was made up for by C. S. Lewis' sense of humor during the christening.SOME SPOILERS (not too much) AHEAD. BE WARNED:That's the environment, I speculate, that nurtured this exciting "Boarding School Kids with Super Powers" story. Only this school ain't no Hogwarts. And these kids are much smarter and sexier than Harry and Hermione and Ron. This headmaster makes girls swoon, which I doubt Dumbledore ever managed. And these kids don't want to be at school. They want to escape.But if they do, all hell (and heaven and Olympus and Elysium and Tartarus and multi-dimensions) will break loose. Havoc, folks, havoc.If you like Greek mythology, smart writing, gorgeous prose, engrossing dialogue, science, and math (I pretty much blanked out at those equational bits, though my husband, the engineer, asked I read them aloud to him)all bound up with exciting plot turns and a delicious sense of humor, and are grown up enough to handle a bit of bawdiness (which, please, what teenager didn't heave of bosom or become enamored of said bosoms, depending on sex or sexual orientation), then get this.Others have pretty much set down the story, but here ya go:Five kids who have forgotten where they came from and what their real names are, and who got to choose their own names (a source of some humor and characterizational insight ensues from this), start to push against the bounds of their imprisonment. Boundaries, actually. (And keep in mind, that these boundaries ain't simple ones like fences and landmarks. Magic plays a part. Perception and powers, too.) They've reached a point in their maturation where their abilities are manifesting. Teenage curiosity is no small thing, and rebellion is natural when one's life is so regimented.The gifted five begin to learn bits and pieces, and then more, and then a lot more, about the nature of their captivity and of their captors. This is where knowing your Greek mythology pays off in spades (the slow reveal). But take heart, eventually, Amelia (the narrator) tells you outright what's up (from her POV and discoveries) and you'll be caught up nicely.The scenes where the kids use their gifts are exhilirating. Especially Quentin and Amelia. Most notably, Amelia, whose ability strengthens and expands and is marvelous to read.I don't want to give away plot points. I don't want to dilute the absolute pleasure you will have turning the pages of the exciting tale. But do know that you will be breathless by the last paragraph and want to bribe someone for the next installment.It's a pity both 2 and 3 don't come out before Christmas. Just as waiting for Potter 7 is an ordeal of sorts, waiting for Chaos 2 has been tough. and waiting for Chaos three will surely be nearly unbearable.John C. Wright is a terrible, awful man for ending on a cliffhanger. Shame on him for hooking me so utterly and leaving me flapping and hyperventilating in mid-air. But then, what does one expect from such creative parentage as Mom Homer and Papa Zelazny. (We try not to speak of Uncle "Gor". He scares the other kids.)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Mir of Mirathon blogspot dot com

I've had this coffeemaker for a month now, and I'm very pleased. It's quick, it's quiet (my previous one was so noisy in the brewing!), and it's easy to rinse out the mesh basket and lid.It does take a bit of getting used to when you get it. The instructions are not the most clear ones I've ever seen. But once you get the hang of it, it's just lovely. And I've never had a better cup of coffee made at home.Recommended.

This series so far (I've only seen the five episodes in this volume so far, and have Netflixed the others) has a very sweet heart. It's not the dark/deadly sort of story. It's basically a quest tale mixed with a friendship/romance story. And both my husband and I--middle aged nerds--have been enjoying it.Synopsis: Princess Sakura (who I understand is an alternate world version of Card Captor Sakura of another anime/manga series) has a deep and bonded friendship-blossoming-to-romance with Syaoran, the son of an archeologist who is continuing his father's work on some mysterious ruins. Sakura, who is innocent and pure and cheerful and sweet-beyond-belief and perky, experiences a strange event where her heart/soul/memories take a winged shape and shatter into feather-fragments that are transported to assorted dimensions. She goes comatose, at risk of death. She and Syaoaran are transported to Yuko (a witch) on her plane/world, along with other main characters--the fair and mysteriously laid-back and fearless magician named Fay D. Flourite and a proud and powerful black-haired warrior named Kurogane (banished by the princess he guarded in order for him to lose his arrogance and learn to be a better person). Each must give up something precious to continue on their quests. The witch provides a communication "device" sort of creature that looks like a white bunny (really silly-cute) who will also aid Syaoran in finding the feathers.So, yeah, basically a quest for assorted things (the feathers sure, but also for what each needs in some way).The purity and innocence of Sakura plays a great role here, too, as she interacts with other characters.I found the fantasy elements a lot of fun and the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran quite heartwarming. I'm curious about the enigmatic Fay and want to see what his deal is (and hope it is revealed later on).I really like the music used. And I like the warm fuzzies I get at various scenes.A delightful anime series (well, from what I can gather seeing only this volume so far).Enjoy.Mir

I love the Pina Colada Jay Robb whey. I mix it with diluted coconut water, shake or blend with ice, and it's like a protein pina colada. Love it!I decided to try this flavor, too...and not so much with the love. The sweetener aftertaste is more noticeable in this flavor and the sweetness level is through the roof. Now, I'm a gal who loves sweet coffee and sweet treats (though I curtail them these days), but this was too sweet even for me. I have to dilute it a lot with almond milk.But, I still like the stats on it, and Jay Robb's whey products are part of my daily diet/fitness routine.I just wish he'd dial back on the sweeteners. :)

I love the scope of Christianity Today. It's the single most anticipated magazine in my household (and I subscribe to MANY). Why? Because I like knowing what's happening in the Body globally, and what issues are impacting the church here and abroad, such as new cults, persecution, movements, government changes, emerging doctrines, changes in leadership, etc.There is always at least one article that challenges me to be a better believer, and there is always one or more issues that I add to my prayer list--be it a particular town's sufferings or a particular person's persecution or a ministry aiding girls bound in sexual slavery or a ministry seeking to free slaves, etc. And I enjoy the yearly selection of best books in particular categories.The columns are terrific, and the round-up of quotes on particular topics (forgiveness, Easter, resurrection, prayer, death, etc) is always worth rereading or tucking into a binder for future readings.If you're a part of the church, this magazine is a great montly overview of events, important persons, emerging movements, and national stories of interest. It's worth subscribing to.(PS: I have no idea what the brief review by Anne Freeman is referring to, but something doesn't sound right. I've subscribed to CT for many years, and you always have a term for which you renew: one year, two years, etc. Once your subscription term nears its completion, they send you a note suggesting you renew. You don't have to renew. I'm assuming the opt-outs are for those persons who are on a trial basis--ie, you get a free trial issue to see if you want it--where you're told that you must return an invoice saying "cancel" or they will continue the sub and you will be billed. In that case, part of trying out the magazine is agreeing to those terms--you try, and then you pay or you opt-out with notification of cancellation. If you don't tell them to cancel and keep receiving the magazines without paying, then, well, that's theft in my book. You're taking what you have not paid for and don't intend to pay for.But if you have a regular subscripton, it runs its term and no more--as it should. A subscription is an agreement: I want this many issues for which I pay you the amount you state for that term. And if you want to cancel early, you write or email or call and say, 'I want to cancel. Send me a refund of what's due." That's standard op for magazines, and I should know: I have subscribed to dozens over the last 20 years, including CT and a sister magazine Christian History. I tried CH for a time, didn't renew, and it expired. I got no hassles. I didn't have to send a letter. I simply let it expire when the year was up.As in all things: Read the agreements, read the terms, and abide by them.)CT, the magazine: Highly Recommended.EDITED ON March 20th to ADD: I contacted Christianity Today to inquire about the accusation leveled in the review by Anne Freeman. They assured me my subscription was not on auto-renew, and they added this:~~As for the posting at Amazon, sometimes customers sign on for the freetrial issues and never respond to the invoices. We do require acancelation notification either by phone or mail. These accounts getsent to our collection department after certain time period, however itis an in-house collections. We do not report to credit bureaus and itdoes not affect credit scores.Hope this eases your mind!~~So, again: Always know what kind of sub you have and the terms. And, as such, be at ease in ordering this magazine. ~~Mir

I've been using this for three weeks. It grinds gorgeously and you can choose how fine/coarse you want the grind. I put it at 16 for my drip coffee.It's easy to use if you don't have some hand issues (ie, arthritis). Anyone with hand/joints issues, this has no handle to pull out the container that holds the ground coffee. You have to grasp it by the edges and pull, which can be hard for some folks.The only reason I worry about the quality is that the little knob that you turn to choose how long it will grind has already fallen off once. No biggie. I put it back in. But a grinder THIS expensive should not have loose parts coming off after only 2 weeks of use. So, I'll be a bit anxious about how long it will work effectively and intact.Still, I'm happy with how it works so far, just not so happy that I'd give it a perfect score.

These sturdy sandals will probably last you for years and years. No kidding. Their business model strives to be eco-friendly and people-friendly--paying employees to ride bikes, get educated, and volunteer--and their shoes and sandals are purposely created to last and last and be repair-able so that resources are preserved.As to comfort--I'm a barefoot kind of gal. I normally chuck shoes as soon as I'm in the door. The fact that I forget to take off my Chacos and leave them on tells you how comfy they are. I have chronic plantar fasciitis and these, though on the hard side in the footbed, nevertheless let my feet move, my toes flex and extend, and don't aggravate my issues.I also appreciate the wide sizing. Not all their stuff has wide sizes (shame on them!), but these do come in wide and they're great.Some folks size down one size, but I got my pairs in the regular 10W. They do have a bit of extra space, I like that for toe "bumper" protection. Up to you. I find that buying my real size makes the arch support "hump" be placed where it needs to be for comfort.Two caveats: 1. these can get stinky. The bottom is rubbery, so not all that breathable (though the foot is mostly exposed, so it's not the kind of stink like closed rubbery shoes. But the sandals are so easy to clean (no fear of messing it up), that I just use an eco-friendly spray cleaner on it every evening and let it dry while I sleep. I get fresh shoes when I wake up. Nice. In a pinch, you could always just spray em with some disinfectant or shoe spray until you can wipe them down. 2. When wet, the Diamond Stealth bottom pattern REALLY REALLY grips. Traction! That means it's great for outdoors, safer, but indoors, a damp sandal bottom will have a suction effect on a smooth floor (ie, linoleum for example). I find this less noticeable in the other sandal bottom pattern.The way the sandal is constructed, the strap is all one piece, and you learn how to pull it to fit your own foot--so it's customizable for comfort. Easy to put on. Easy to take off. these are my sandals of choice when I head to Pilates, so I can walk fast to class as a warm up and then get them off superfast to do my session.I really love my Chacos. Though they are costly--I mean, it's 100 bucks!--I bought FOUR pairs, one in red, one in a blue pattern, these black ones, and one in an orange-brown pattern. That way, I have a pair to go with every casual outfit I have.These aren't sexy or glamourous or dressy. These are just really usefull, strong, comfy everyday sandals--great for shopping, errands, hanging in the garden, going for walks in the rain, picnicking, whatever. When you're dressed easy, these are easy for you, too.thumbs up.MirUPDATE: I ordered another pair in one size down from my normal 10W (ie. 9W) and I do prefer the fit in the smaller size. So, just a heads up.

For close to three years now, I've been a faithful flosser--when I never was before-- and this Reach flosser is why. I got a free one at one of my dental cleanings, and I became an instant fan.It's so easy to use--snap on, snap off the heads--and it does REACH back there easily to get the back teeth that are such a pain to floss the old-fashioned way.It's a simple design, it's easy to use, and it flosses great. What's not to love?As long as they make these, I'll be buying them. I have four at home, one for hubby, one for me, and two back-ups, just in case one breaks or something. But in 3 years of regular usage, mine has not broken/snapped/become defective in any way.Recommended.Mir

My husband has always had digestive issues, and I developed reflux in my late thirties. Because of this, I started buying enzymes some years ago. When I take these consistently (ie, with all meals, but especially the heavier ones like supper), I find my gastric reflux stays controlled. When I forget to take them, I don't sleep as well.We've had good results from these, so we will continue to take them.

Spin is a remarkable novel told skillfully in prose that is clean and well-crafted and that frequently rises to a place of stunning vividness and beauty. I give Wilson credit for using utterly perfect metaphors. Sometimes--you know how it is--you're reading and a metaphor is so odd or jarring that it stops you cold, sometimes with a grimace. Not Wilson. He is in complete charge of his sentences. When they rise, they do so effortlessly and when they descend, you're left a little breathless for a second. Gorgeous.He also does not sacrifice characterization in the pursuit of scientific dazzle or cute ideas. He handles both the science plot and his engaging, sympathetic (and even less sympathetic) characters with depth and nimbleness. They are not perfect people, but they are good and needy and terrified. And they are believable.I am avocado with envy.The plot and allusions are smartly handled at the wikipedia entry, and plenty of synopses are available in reviews on this site, so I'll let you get the plot summaries elsewhere. I'll give the core of it: It's a story that follows three protagonists who watch the stars go out one night in their adolescence, and their long journey together (and apart) to discover the why and what and who, even as they deal in their own ways with a looming apocalypse. The scientist, the religious zealot (sorta), and the doctor-friend who loves them both and is in love with one form the story's central triangle of characterization.I will add that there is a character who becomes involved with Christian cults/sects as a response to the astonishing inciting incident of the novel. While Christians are hardly pictured as heroic or admirable in the novel--the scientist is the hero here--there is also not the utter cheap shooting that one comes across now and then in secular SF/horror/etc, where ministers are all abusing or raping someone and religious folks are nutters who want to whip their kids into a blood sausage between picketing gays and grubbing for money. (serenity now...serenity now...) There is a certain sympathy that is shown to people so frightened and seeking for meaning and "an answer" that they fall into weird religious sects (or even not-so-weird ones). I wasn't terribly put off by the depiction of Christians as mostly deluded but well-meaning (it's what I expect from secularists) or just plain useless and naive, if cheerful. At least we're not all out to lynch the scientists and burn the Martians. (One takes one's consolation where one can.)A really beautifully done novel where the threads of the various plots are woven seamlessly and the flashing back and forth in time is handled with such aplomb that you are not lost in transits. Not once.A great premise. Three strongly drawn protagonists (and some well-done secondary characters). Believable conflicts. Believable extrapolations (meaning even if you--or I--aren't up on our science we can believe that these actions are feasible and yield results). Complicated human relationships. Action and suspense. Some romance. Good dialogue. A sense of wonder at the cosmos. This story merited its HUGO AWARD.The ending is uplifting and magical, even, though this is real science fiction and not a fantasy novel. I think any of you who picks up SPIN will find quite a lot to enjoy, even if science fiction is not your usual cup of tea. The human drama is so compelling that lovers of good, dramatic general fiction will have a grand time.If you want to study a novel to see how to handle shifts in time and a complex plot that works out through various decades, to learn how to weave in science in interesting ways that relate to character, to make a looming apocalypse seem more than an occasion for over-the-top heroes and hysteria--or flat prose and ho-hum protagonists--then read this with an analytical eye.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I've tried a lot of protein bars. I have Metabolic Syndrome, and I need to have snacks between meals to keep my sugar steady and my appetite somewhat under control.Well, let's face it, a lot of those low-carb bars tastes pretty funky. Either dry and with a sort of weird aftertaste, or not chocolatey enough, or not sweet enough to tame a sweet-craving, etc.I just tried these yesterday. The market had run out of the ones I usually get (The South Beach) and so I bought this one. (I like the EAS protein drink that tastes like Yahoo!, so I figured I'd give it a go.)What a surprise. These are way, way, way better than any I've tried, including Pure Protein, Myoplex, Atkins, Luna, etc, and even the South Beach ones.If you are a person who likes chocolate meal bars for snacks (or meal replacements), then trust me, these taste VERY chocolatey, have a really nice texture (not overly chewy, not dry, not gunky), and it actually serves to satisfy the need for something sweet and desserty. Really nice. It's not low-fat, though, so keep that in mind. And if you have thyroid issues or sensitivity to SOY products, forget it. The first ingredient is a protein blend with soy. Note: If you have thyroid issues, keep soy intake to minimal or none. I have thyroid issues, so for me, this would be an occasional treat to keep me from going piggers over chocolate or candy or cake.This has maltitol, and if you're sensitive or get gastric disturbances from that (some do), watch intake. Would not recommend more than one bar a day, for sure, if you get the ickies from maltitol.The stats for one bar:Calories = 240Total Fat= 8 grams (no trans fat, 6 grams of saturated fat)negligible cholesterolSodium = 340; Potassium = 230Total Carbs: 27 grams; Sugar Alcohols 17 grams); Net carbs= 4 gramsDietary Fiber: 6 gramsAssorted vitamins and mineralsProtein 17 grams.There it is. A really fabulous tasting low-carb chocolate bar that's got 17 grams of protein.EnjoyMir

I've tried several of the DMRF soup and products. Some of the soups were pretty bland and not worth repurchasing. Some I liked quite a bit--the split pea, the spring onion, the boxed vegetable, for example. This instant soup from the line is the best. I like it even more than then ready-to-serve bean one (I have that one at home, too, as well as the lentil of the boxed ones.)I boil water and pour it in and cover the cup (with a bread plate) and let it sit for several minutes. It ends up a richly thick soup, creamy-bean texture (which is how I like my black bean soup and red bean soups), and it actually has flavor. You can smell the cumin right off when you open the flavor pack to stir into the beans.I'm Cuban. I grew up eating some sort of legume/pulse/bean just about every day. As poor immigrants, black bean or red bean or chick peas or lentils or split peas or white beans were a big part of our daily dinners. Black bean soup is one of those quintessential Cuban specialties. This one has more of a Mexican vibe, but it's very n ice. Even this bean-freak can say this is a lovely instant soup, surprisingly so (instant and "lovely" don't always go together).Be aware that this one large cup is considered two servings, so the total calories for eating the whole cup (as I do) is 340. It has 28 grams of fiber (really?!!), so it's mighty filling. Add some rice or crackers or toast or something to turn it into a complete protein and add fruit or a light salad and you have a very satisfying meal for a not unreasonable amount of calories. If you only have half the cup and save the rest, your damage is minimal (ie, if you're on a weight loss program). Sodium is not unreasonable for a convenience soup.If you haven't tried this one in Dr. McDougall's line, do so. If you love beans, this should definitely make you happy.Enjoy!

I love--and need!--compression in my workout wear. I exercise regularly, and have for nearly 4 years, in an effort to lose weight. I've lost 120 lbs, and that means, yeah, loose skin. So, my shorts/pants and such need to HOLD stuff IN, comfortably, but surely. I still need to be able to MOVE, after all.These are nice for hot days. The compression is NOT a lot (so that other reviewer, Wendy etc, is right). BUT..I find that the size chart is right (I bought my Large size ones when my waist was 35 and hips 45 inches). The compression is light, but enough for me to walk or do Pilates without the "loose stuff" being uncomfortable.I do prefer THICKER fabric and MORE compression, ideally. But it gets mighty warm down here in the SouthEast, and these shorts are not oppressive on those warmer, hotter days when I gotta walk or workout in a Pilates studio with a less than mighty-mojo a/c.If what you want is supercompression, go a size down or find another brand. If you need a lot of thigh compression, this might not be for you. Consider the Reebok "easy tone", which compresses well (too tight for me, though, for a hard workout). I wish they still made the Ryka capris. Great thickness, compression, and style! I will weep when mine are no longer wearable.If you want a balance of light-to-medium compression in a thinner fabric for hotter weather, here ya go.If you recommend a great longer type of compression short (7 to 11 inches, as I need coverage), please leave a comment. Especially for those thicker fabric shorts. Include sizing info (as I find the stuff online--charts and such--are often just useless.)Be well...

I don't need to say anything to Koontz fans, cause you already read this and loved it, right? Everyone else: Read it. If you like supernatural-suspense with an engaging, likable protagonist and characters you care about and want to be safe in the most horrible of situations--and big bads that are truly evil--here you go.The protagonist (Odd is his first name, not just a trait) can see the dead. He is a good guy with a good heart and a true love, but he feels the burden of his gift and tries to make it as much of a blessing as his 20-year old, poor-guy limitations can offer. In this novel of the series, the "apocalypse" in one of its very human forms--no, not the devil and his minions, but the evil that MEN do-- is coming to Pico Mundo (his town). He uses his ability to try and stop the coming carnage. The clock ticks inexorably. Everyone he loves is in danger. He himself might die.And off we go, reading page by page, loving Odd more, and his delightful girlfriend Stormy, and those who care about him. And those who would rather see him out of the picture.The story is told in first person (Odd narrates) and you like being in his head and heart. We all want good folks to be heroes, and Odd is good, if haunted by a horrendous childhood. It's not till the latter part of the novel that you learn just how awful his childhood was, and the scene where Koontz delivers this is chilling and heartbreaking.Koontz knows how to depict evil--both human and inhuman-- and he knows how to depict good--both mortal and immortal. We get both the dark and light of humanity here. The supernatural component includes, of course, ghosts (and Elvis hangs out with Odd), but also another type of being that only Odd can see. Fortunately, Odd is one of the lights in a darkening world.Terrific supernatural-suspense novel. A page-turner. Don't start reading it until Friday so you can stay up all night. :D

A few years ago (2004) my sugar started to go up into the bad zone (ie, I had been prediabetic for a while with Metabolic Syndrome, but the sugar was now out of the normal zone and heading into diabetic.) Well, I did a couple things. I stopped eating carbs alone (began a habit of eating fruits and starches only with some fat and protein) and I started taking cinnamon supplementation (real in food, capsules, then I tried this, Cinnergen).My sugar got down to normal without losing weight (which is the best way to do it, but hey, tough, right?). Right down to the nineties, then eighties. No need for medication. yay.I slacked off in the last year, since I started eating organic and more produce, but I do see that my sugar has come to the nineties. Before it goes back to 121 (the number that scared me into using cinnamon and food pairing to start), I ordered this again.I love the flavor and it's so easy to take the dosage as directed. Nicer experience than just downing capsules.If you don't use real cinnamon liberally and want to keep your sugar in a nicer zone, give this a shot. Worked for me.

I'll readily admit that I bought this because I liked the idea of a mystery series with Sherlock Holmes' little sister as the protagonist. And I was not disappointed. Nancy Springer has taken on a fine Victorian voice for this series and Enola is intrepid, bright, curious, logical, and a lot of fun to follow around.Granted, we run ahead of her a bit in catching some clues, which is really the only fault I give this. The pace is nice. The riddles to be solved are fun to work through. And knowing that Sherlock and Mycroft are there, secondarily, is part of the thrill.In this, her first case, there are two disappearances for Enola Holmes to solves--her mother's and a young aristocrat's. The first is obviously quite personal and painful, but it's also mentally stimulating and well-motivated. We learn, through Enola's own actions and worries and woes, just how restricted life was for ladies of her time.A very good start to a series that is not just for kids. Adults can enjoy this, too.

I've got 10 wide shoe size, so finding a comfy fit is tough with regard to a lot of athletic wear, and I found that the case with bowling shoes.So. I ordered a men's style.And behold, these were perfect in a size 8.5 (for my 10W feet). I've used them a couple times and have had no problems with pinching or heel looseness.love em.

I saw this film in 2006, although I've wanted to see it since it was first reviewed on television. I remember thinking, "yes, I think this is a kind of movie I'd enjoy. Gentle and full of real people, with a dash of romance."It took me a while to find it on DVD. I'd forgotten the name. I only remembered "The Stranger" and that a kid was involved.So, I finally get it, watch it, and I think, "Oh, my. That was wonderful."Here's why:1. Gerard Butler is a revelation. I'd seen him prior on a DVD I own, Tomb Raider: CRADLE OF LIFE, and thought he was very hot and charismatic, holding his own amazingly well against the also charismatic and physically stunning Angelina Jolie. But in DEAR FRANKIE, he delivers a lower key and layered performance. He's not just the hunk or the bad boy or the muscle-bound hero. He's the unnamed man who comes out of the blue to help a woman who needs him to pretend he's a young boy's daddy. He needs to play his part then leave. For money. But we can see something else: He's a man with secrets, and secret hurts, and deep needs that the film never reveals. No, you see it in Butler's eyes, in his body language, in his reactions. Lovely.2. Emily Mortimer. She is absolutely wonderful as the protective mom who has had a very hard time due to an abusive husband from which she flees. She portrays both determination and vulnerability and neediness and a waifishness that makes you root for her. She's believably desperate.The woman who plays Emily's mother also adds something special to the film, as does the somewhat strange air of the boy Frankie. He's deaf in the film, and he doesn't get much dialogue, so he has to make it work with gestures and expressions. He does fine. A bit wooden in spots, but for the context, it's fine.As the story unfolds and we learn things--why Frankie is deaf, who the Stranger is--and we see a believable chemistry erupt between Butler and Mortimer, all we can do is surrender to the gently-paced, emotional stroll through these wounded people's lives. And that kiss...that kiss. It's so perfectly done, mixing apprehension and desire and all the holding back and baggage and tenderness. Oh, that kiss.A lovely, lovely little film. I recommend it.

I'm a recent fan to this long-running band, but after acquiring a few of their cds and enjoying some online videos, I decided to get this DVD. I want to thank previous in-depth reviewers, such as Sean Boyle, for doing such great jobs.For those like me who don't speak Japanese or understand it, the major disappointment will be the lack of a subtitle option. You won't know the content of the non-English songs, and you won't know what the band is chatting about backstage or on the bus/shoots. Nevertheless, it's really nice to see this very talented band perform live, and it's nice to see them in their more relaxed, even mellow times, and watch them pose for photographs.Hyde is indubitably sexy, and I say that though I never much cared for the small/slight/girly type. His charisma transcends his delicacy and feminine aspects. A very appealing performer with a voice that can hit some raw bits and go awry, but mostly is in good form and hitting some beautiful, soaring high spots. He's a gem.The other bandmates, though not pretty and as charismatic, nevertheless do an excellent job of performing some truly good J-rock tunes. A big drum set-up for Yukihiro, and it's fun to watch him bang away. Tetsu is a terrific bassist and Ken's guitar makes me very happy. I was sorry that the fuzzy guitar part in Stay Away didn't play out as well live as it does on the cd version.All in all, fans old and new of L'Arc-En-Ciel should enjoy this quite a bit.I couldn't make it to any of the Vamps concerts this year (Hyde and Kaz, who I think make terrific music together). So, I got this to get my J-Rock/Hyde fix until, hopefully, one day, one of Hyde's bands makes it to Miami.Mir

My first pair of Chaco's sandals was this style in the "Razz" color--which is the muted red print on the dark brown footbed.OH..MY..Plantar Fasciitis Relief!I found these so comfy, so soothing to my troubled feet, that I ordered them in another sandal style (no toe wrap, black) and fell in love with those even more. This style, while nice and comfy, can be troublesome around the toe for some (and even me some days if I don't adjust the straps just so).These do keep your foot in place better than the other non-toe wrap style, but the others give the foot more flexibility. So, this style gets one star removed for that particular issue--the toe thing. Some people prefer the stability of the toe-wrap. I prefer the freedom and ability to "shrug" my toes in the other styles.I now have five pairs of these pricey sandals (OMIGOSH, how much I spent!) because they make my feet happy. These may not be sexy, but they are well-constructed, will last ages, can be cleaned after every use with a cleanser and sponge or an antibacterial gel (I sometimes use that with a sponge or cloth) and a shot of Lysol. (Yeah, I like my sandals CLEAN.) And it doesn't affect it. They keep right on striding.Walk in a soggy garden, through the rain, in the dirt. No matter. These clean up and keep going.With casual wear, these are my number one footwear now. Cool. Anti-fungal (for those with these issues, these let your feet BREATHE). Esy to care for. Fun in a kicky casual groove with jeans and leggings (bootcut, especially).And the company tries to be socially and eco-responsible. That's a plus.If you have plantar fasciitis, give these a try. These are the ONLY shoes I don't immediately kick off when I get home. :)Mir--with happy Chaco's feetNOTE: These run a bit large. I have them in both my normal size (10) and in one smaller(9), and I find I prefer the smaller size. It's up to how much "bumper room" you like for your feet. Strongly recommend you consider downsizing a size, and if you're between sizes (ie, you're 8.5), definitely size down to an 8, rather than up to a 9.

I love a good, scary, thrilling page-turner. It doesn't have to have literary level prose with stunning new metaphors and five-fathom deep characterization. It just has to creep me out and keep me guessing and flipping pages like a madwoman.Dekker had me doing the latter and feeling the former two things. I liked that a lot.This is a Christian horror novel (in case someone reading this had no clue). It's a Christian publisher, a Christian author, and the book has Christian characters. There's some God-talk. You should know.You should also not be put off by that if, as I stated, you like a good vs evil story with imaginative and very creepy elements.The others have provided story synopses here, so you don't need mine, but just in case you're gonna gripe if I don't give it to you, here goes:Story opens with a bad guy walking into a Colorado town called Paradise. He's definitely not seeming like a good guy, especially given what he does to the first townsman he meets. (Gory.) It's Marsuvees Black and he's come to show Paradise what real hope and grace mean. Only his vision of hope and grace is a really scary one, and it will make you wonder if it's not Lucifer himself come calling to turn Paradise into Hell.But Paradise, Colorado has a secret community nearby made up of especially smart students (orphans) and the monks who are conducting an experiment (educational in part, but theological and redemptive at core) with these same students.And soon, it becomes obvious that the fate of Paradise, possibly the world itself, will rest on the struggle between good and evil within the souls and minds and hearts of these students in the secret community. And Paradise will be doomed or be saved depending on what choices the monks and students...and one lone boy from Paradise choose to do.I'd have to rate this book as at minimum PG 13 and more likely R (for the disturbing violence that a Christian book-buying audience may not always be comfy with.) However, I figure the world is a bloody, violent, evil-riddled place, and anyone who can read a newspaper or TIME magazine without puking--not to mention King or Koontz--should do just fine.Ted Dekker's writing here is lean and moves along without excessive description. Koontz and King are, I believe, better wordsmiths, but Dekker is at least as good at keeping things moving and the questions rising and the creeps crawling. His invention of a truly gross "dungeony" place where the kids learn about their own inclinations--and not good ones--is Lovecraftian a bit, Bentley Little-ish a bit. Generally: gross. But that's fine. Horror has the freedom as a genre to turn your guts about as well as make your hairs rise.I deleted a star because the ending chapters lacked clarity. I didn't find the path to the resolution utterly well-developed. I even went "huh" at one part, not really sure what went on, and had to reread. There's a lovely Scriptural parallel in some things that go on, but I think a bit more time was needed in the actual showdown part of SHOWDOWN.Ultimately: a really cool Christian horror read. Go, Ted!Mir

I ordered these this week from my organic foods delivery service. OH MY WORD! Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.I also like that it's organic.I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.Enjoy.Mir

My review is for AUTHENTIC K-Pak reconstructor (and if you don't get it from a salon/authorized dealer, you can't know if it's the real thing, honestly). It's tops in terms of protein treatments I've tried for my very dry, porous, color-treated hair. The real product is best used in a way that allows for at least 25 or more minutes of it with a processing cap and under a hood for heat or with a heat therapy cap. It MUST be followed by a deep conditioner for best results. This is not a conditioner. It's a reconstructor. The conditioner should FOLLOW.If your hair is not happy with protein (coarse hair tends to react BADLY to a lot of protein), steer clear. But if you have fine hair or damaged/color-treated hair of medium texture or know your hair loves protein, try this. It's great. Gives softness and shine that lingers.But get it from an authorized seller best to avoid getting bad product or old product (check the Joico site online for authorized sellers). Or, if you want to save money, there's a knock-off/dupe version done by Sally Beauty that has identical ingredients (it seems) and many gals I know rave about. Me, I stick to the original just to be safe. :) This thing does what it says it will do. It's great.Happy hair days to you!

I bought this scale on amazon some years ago. I've used various scales over the years in my dieting quests, but this one has been, hands down the best. I bought it when I was morbidly obese, around 100 pounds heavier than now, and my main interest was a scale that was 1. wide enough for my big self to stand securely (this is nicely wide), 2. registered above 300 (cause, well, I did hit 300 pounds at one point) and 3. relatively accurate.This satisfied all three. It also gives your previous weigh-in (the second line). And it has five weight selections, so a family of five can each have their own scale tracker. Hubby and I appreciate that. :DI've found it to be oddly accurate. I weigh-in before going to the doc, and the variation is always about the weight of my clothes and shoes (roughly 4 pounds).Using AA batteries is great. No special battery required. We always have AA's around for various electronic items, so this is sweet.A lovely scale. Durable, wide, good for morbidly obese or obese folks aiming to lose.I'm not obese anymore, and this scale was one of my invaluable tools.Happy weighing!

I can't tell you how wonderful this liquid soap is (and the bar soap is not shabby, either, but definitely get the liquid). Dr. Bronner's is one of the few soaps/gels with scent that doesn't irritate my super-sensitive skin. Most gels and soaps make me itch or get dermatitis. Not this one.The minty smell is a joy. Makes you feel so clean. And it lathers like nobody's business. A little goes a loooooooooooong way. Many gels claim the same, but it's a fib. This one really lathers like crazy. (I find that I can make it last longer by diluting the contents with water for showering purposes. Still great cleansing and smell.)For hot days, nothing is more refreshing than a cool shower with minty Dr. Bronner's.The packaging is basic (good, I want what's inside to work well and the price to be low). The label is actually quite weird. (Other reviewers have commented on the "trippy" or "hippy" text. They ain't exaggerating.) You'll get a kick out of trying to figure out the odd--but nice!--writing on the label.I really recommend this product. Great smell, affordable, and effective.

I had pretty much removed grains from my diet to lose 120 lbs. I started adding back no-gluten carbs (a bit of rice, a bit of tubers). But when cold weather hit, I wanted something comforting and hot and "cerealy". I already had used Bob's Red Mill products and knew they were GOOD STUFF. So, I decided this didn't have such a bad carb hit per serving (15 net carbs per 1/3 cup dry)Really lovely. Easy to fix (cook for 2 minutes, let stand 2 minutes, done). I sweeten it with fruit or sucralose and I'm good to go. I feel like my mom is "mothering" me, making me feel very cozy. It hasn't impeded my diet so far (though I was leery of readding a cereal). I figure the anti-nutrients in the oats is worth the comfort. :DIf you like oat bran cereal, this is a great one and the price here is good for the 4 pack. (I wish the folks who ordered it via amazon would mention the expiration date, as I have sometimes gotten foodstuffs here close to expiration, and 4 bags of this would last me quite a while...) I plan to order this 4-pack and hoping it's a fresh batch. Will update if otherwise.The nutritionals:Nutrition FactsServing Size: 1/3 cup dry (31g)Servings Per Container: 16 (per 18 oz. bag)AmountPer Serving % DailyValue*Total Calories 120Calories From Fat 15Total Fat 2 g 3%Saturated Fat 0 g 0%Trans Fat 0 gCholesterol 0 mg 0%Sodium 0 mg 0%Total Carbohydrates 21 g 7%Dietary Fiber 6 g 22%Sugars 0 gProtein 5 gVitamin A 0%Vitamin C 0%Calcium 2%Iron 8%Thumbs up from me!And for folks doing that Dukan Diet, which isn't what I do, I hear this is suitable for that.

I've tried various nutritional products touting Acai content, but this is, by far, the most TREATastic of the bunch. I'll let someone else confirm the active level of the ingredients or processing purity. All I can say is that this tastes fabulous, and I look forward to shaking it up to have with my protein snack between meals.Very intense purple color. Clean fruity taste. The Acai's odd "olive" taste doesn't show through as strongly as Mona Vie (this tastes way better). If you want PURE Acai, this isn't it. But this certainly is a delightful product, and it makes me happy.If you're tired of healthy supplement powders that taste like crap, switch to Berry Splash. (I keep two in the pantry so I don't run the risk of running out. No kidding.)And on extra stressed up days, I add a punch of pure acai juice to it. It spoils the taste, but it's a nice pick-me-up and free-radical killer. (Pure Acai by itself tastes icky.)Try it. Enjoy it. (But don't spill it on your clothes and wipe it up fast if it gets on your countertop. This stuff stains.)Mir

You probably wouldn't be reading this if you hadn't already seen the first season of DEXTER, the one that introduces us to this unique serial killer and blood splatter forensics expert, the destroyer of destroyers, and a guy trying to figure out how to live with his dark passenger--his terrible sociopathic need to kill.While the first season focused on the search for and relationship of Dexter to the Ice Truck Killer, the second season takes us into Dexter's crisis of identity, and the noose narrowing about his neck as his cache of victims (underwater in the Atlantic) is retrieved and analyzed and start pointing uncomfortably close. His antagonist, Sgt Doakes, gets off, then back on Dexter's case. It will begin a showdown of significance. We learn more about some of the characters, including Dexter's foster dad, and his sister Deb gets to have (another) romance. Not a serial killer this time.Dexter also develops a new relationship with a woman who has an affinity for things dark and dangerous. Is she his soulmate? The consequences of this relationship ripple into the lives of Dexter's loved ones, including Rita and her kids.Keith Carradine comes into the cast as an FBI expert on serial killers, one with a bit of a zen vibe. He's excellent in his (temporary?) role.Wonderful plotting, terrific acting, excellent dialogue, and well-rounded characterization make for a quality series that doesn't droop or disappoint in its second season.Now, I gotta see Season Three. Whoo!Mir

I never made waffles in my life, but I got tired of getting frozen ones and decided to check out the inexpensive-ish waffle makers on amazon. I picked this one due to 1. the excellent reviews and 2. no multiple posts about particular, recurring problems.So, I got it today and I used it right off. As instructed, I discarded the first batch (which gave me a chance to practice, anyway).With the second batch, they came out nice right off. I did have to learn how much to pour--not having done this previously--so that there was no spill-over.A previous reviewer mentioned that on the 5 setting, waffles cooked through but weren't browned enough. I agree. I followed the instruction in the booklet (start with 3 or 4 settings) and those were really mushy and floppy. Setting 5 was okay, and 6 was better. But the highest setting 7, made them just right. NOT burned. Not floppy. Nice and light and crispy outside, with a nice brownish color.I recommend setting 7, but you can experiment on your first "throwaway" batch.Really easy to use. Beeps when it's hot enough. Beeps again, after you pour in the batter, when the waffle is cooked through.I'll update this if I have problems later, but I really liked how this worked right out of the box.(For reference, I used a waffle mix I bought online, Golden Malt, but the booklet has recipes, too, for ones you mix yourself.)MirJULY UPDATE: I've been using the waffle maker once a week (occasionally twice) since I bought it. I make a big batch (enough for a week of breakfasts for hubby, a couple for me) and freeze them. They taste great reheated in a toaster oven--crunchier outside.I still find that the best setting is the top one (darkest), and I even let it sit anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds after the beep to get them browner (like hubby likes them). I like them fine as they come out at the beep of the last setting.Anyway, still a nice waffle maker for a nice price.

Unlike some reviews here, I won't give away any spoilers, because the maximum enjoyment of THE PRESTIGE depends on--like a magic act--not knowing how it works (at least at first). I think it's despicable that some reviewers ruin the climax with plot giveaways without clear spoiler warnings. For shame.Story: Two magicians (Jackman, Bale) begin as joint apprentices and, after a pivotal tragic event, end up obsessed and bitter rivals who keep upping the magic stakes in a quest to be number one. Each cannot rest until he knows the other's magic secrets as each man takes his turn being the best.Ultimately, the game will be about more than magic tricks and will spill over, affecting every part of each man's life. There will be no turning back for either, because the ultimate of tricks (the one they've each constructed from their rivalry and mutual loathing) must play out to the very end. And only one magician can be the best.The acting is terrific. Jackman is the polished, eloquent, well-dressed, well-groomed, handsome front-man whose showmanship captivates crowds. But as we see him turn darker and more obsessed, we begin to worry for him.Bale is the coarser, vulgarly-accented one who is unswervingly committed to the craft. He ends up creating a trick that drives Jackman over the edge to all-out, heedless obession: The Transported Man. The quest by Jackman's character to find the secret of this trick will lead him down a very dark road.Bale plays his complicated role with convincing shades. Jackman is superb, sometimes pitiable, sometimes repulsive. Michael Caine does well--as always--as the man in the middle. A good man who loves his career, but who is stuck between the competitive madness. His sound advice goes unheeded, and we know that tragedy must be the result...While both leads are immensely watchable, Caine and Johansson are terrific in supporting roles.And the fact that we are reminded over and over about the title--the prestige, that part of the act where the audience is befuddled and amazed and the magician gets his glorious due, the moment of wonder and the unsolved trick--tells us we should watch, watch carefully, because the movie is about to pull a heckuva rabbit out of the hat.And it's hard as the film proceeds to be sure who you should root for. First this one, then that one, then...no one? Obsession is fascinating to watch, and revenge makes for a strong plot driver, but it's difficult to know who is in the right and who is in the wrong, or if both are wrong. Shades of gray turn to black, sometimes.Unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, last year's other feature film with a magician as the man character, this one does have surprises, things up its sleeve, that you realize bit by bit. THE ILLUSIONIST was easy to solve. You realize the trick way before the ending. In THE PRESTIGE, you are given enough clues to figure out bits of the trick early on, in the middle, and even up to the BIG one, but it still keeps you wondering, "What? What will they do? How will I be surprised?"And that's a lot of fun. The wondering. Because even when you congratulate yourself for figuring X or Y out early, you still have a ways to go until...the last moments of THE PRESTIGE, and at least ONE secret will not be divulged until then.It's a fast-paced and delicious sleight-of-hand film with two dazzling male leads who keep you guessing.RECOMMENDED.

I'm relatively new to Bollywood flicks. This one was, maybe, the fifth one I saw. I wanted to see it because it had Aishwarya Rai (yes, I'm a big fan of hers) and because I find Mr. Sharukh Khan watchable: He's got something, some "it" factor, even if he's not the best actor you'll come across. The surprise for me was the older gentleman. I found he had great charisma, Mr. Amitab Bachan--tall, distinguished looking, that terrifically deep voice. It was interesting to see the younger, more physical Mr. Khan in his confrontations with the elegant Mr. Bachan.Basically, this is a story of four loves--three current, one past. The teacher of a renowned school has very strict rules. He's an unyielding man, strict and humorless. To his school come three young men who become pals and one man to join the faculty as a music teacher. Through the interaction of the Older School Head and the music teacher, we learn of the old love story and see how confrontation and mercy can bring about a salutatory change in even the hardest of hearts. Through the interaction of the music teacher and the three students, we see how a teacher can influence his pupils. Through the love stories, we see how difficulties cannot stamp out true love. Eventually, even a past tragedy is redeemed in the present, and wounded hearts heal.The film is worth buying just for the Holi festival musical/dance number. It's just fabulous--the white clothing, the tinted powders that are strewn and begin to color every participant. The joyfulness and emotion. A terrific Bollywood number.My favorite of the "young" love stories was the one with the widow, very moving. My least favorite was the one with the "hip athletic" couple. Kinda annoying. The "middling" one had a very immature heroine who, although "quite cute" according to my husband, was not the brightest bulb in the box. Then again, these ARE young folks, so my expectations may be too high.As usual, Bollywood flicks offer good-looking actors, nifty costumes, and good music. I think anyone who can let themselves go from Western/Hollywood expectations of what is good editing/acting can enjoy the delights of this film. I"m not Indian,and I did.Mir

I'm not familiar with GROWING PAINS, so I can only comment on the first half of this double cd: LAUGHTER IN YOUR SOUL.The title refers to a track--"You'll Start Falling in Love"--which is the very first song I heard on the local Christian radio starion and taped with my weenie hand-held recorder to learn the lyrics. I didn't know who the artist was (This was 1975, no internet, and in my neighborhood, not Christian record stores). I just knew I loved the song. I learned it...and have sung it for three decades, sans music (cause I didn't know until a few years ago who sang it). Thank the internet!---"Take a rest by the quiet stream;It will do you good.Go wade in the Pool of Bethsaida--well, you really should!It'll do you good.And you'll start falling in love again.And you'll start bringing the laughterin your soul; Hear it ringing in your soul..."The song "Love Is" and "Charity" are also very good. I'm less inclined to like the super cheery- peppy ones. I prefer the ones that let her folksy soprano--reminiscent in parts of Joan Baez--waft and flow.Her voice and Annie Herrings mesh perfectly. Keith Green's piano sound like...Keith Green! If you like those pioneers of Contemporary Christian sounds (folksy, popsy, etc), you may like this. If you want to hear what we middle-aged folks were listening to as teens in the early to mid 70's when we didn't have the huge structure of modern CCM music, this is one.And "The Victor" is one of the best Christian songs of the 20th century, period. I prefer Keith's version, but this is a superb song that I sing out loud every Easter season. Wonderful.Gosh, this makes me feel 15 again.If you want to hear samples, visit YouTube where if you search under "Jamie Owens" , you'll find that someone has posted the songs of LAUGHTER IN YOUR SOUL.Enjoy,Mir

Hubby and I went gluten free last year, and a lot of gluten free baked goods can be really lacking (like those tasteless english muffins and dry bagels and funky crumbly cookies). These, however, please my hubby, the gingersnap fanatic.Let's say right up front: They don't snap.Who cares. Hubby loves them. I tasted part of one (I'm not the ginger cookie freak, he is). It's very flavorful and gingery. The outside crust is nice, with a chewy inside. These are softer than I'm used to experiencing ginger snaps. These give me a gingerbread vibe.I remember buying the Mi-Del ones and finding them awful. These are nice. Even I'd eat them if a cookie craving hit.I bought our bag at Nutrition S'Mart, but if these delivered ones can make it in proper piece (not pieces), then hooray.Enjoy...

I'll freely admit that the reason I watched the premiere of Castle (and every episode since) is because Nathan "Captain Mal" Fillion is in it. Love the man. LOOOOVE him. He was pitch perfect as the futuristic dashing spaceship captain, a hoot in Dr. Horrible's, and he's got an incredible comedic ability blended with good acting chops and toothsome looks. He's great.So, finally, we see him get top dog billing on a prime time show on one of networks. He's Rick Castle, a bestselling author who is drawn into a partnership (of sorts) with police detective Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic when murders by a serial killer are based on Castle's novels. She's the reluctant partner, he's having a grand old time (with lots of humor), needling her while also being insightful and helpful due to his myriad connections. (I do enjoy how, as the show progresses, we see how he puts that celebrity of his to good use.) That's the core of the show, the conflict and chemistry between the cop and the writer.It works because of Fillion's immense personal charm, humor, and snap-crackliness. Stana is fine in her semi-tense, driven, cop-girl who doesn't eat enough way, but the show is Nathan's.It was nice to see Susan Sullivan of Dharma and Greg fame again, this time as flamboyant mom--oh, those bright outfits, that hair--to Castle. She's good in anything, frankly. We also have a cute if way, way, way too sweet-and-nice daughter to Castle. (Pulease, I haven't met a teen this squeaky nice since Sunday School decades ago. Given grandma's dramatics and dad's wicked sense of humor, where did she come from?)The scenes of daughter and dad tend to be really squishily heartwarming, and that's okay with me. Sometimes, I need that sentimental dose.The supporting cop cast adds to the fun--watch them enjoy their espresso in the episode where Castle springs for one for the crew.Whether Katic will be able to keep up is my main worry. She is doing okay, and there are moments when you're glad she's the crankier one, "straight man." But this show will rise or fall on not just Fillion's talent and charisma--and yes, hottienss--but on whether she can really ramp it up and keep the core hot.If you like a less serious cop show, and you are a fan of Fillion's, you've gotta watch/get CASTLE.

I give this 2.5 stars, and that's mostly because 1. the gimmick/idea that ties together the "whys" of Dracula is interesting and 2. Gerard Butler has amazing screen presence.The story: Baddies go to steal a hidden treasure (thinking valuable item). This item has been encased and entombed by Van Helsing (yeah, that Van Helsing), the guardian of this particular treasure. As you can guess, it's not jewels or the Holy Grail. It does have to do with blood: Dracula. Baddies get killed/turned. Dracula, who has some kind of psychic connection to Van Helsing's daughter, Mary(estranged from Papa and living in New Orleans pre-Katrina), goes seeking the woman of his dreams. Nothing really interesting or spooky happens. Yes, folks get bitten. Yes, some get killed. Yes, nice guy goes to save Mary from a toothy fate. Sirens do their ho-hum thing to nice guy hero. Dracula has showdown with Mary. And...well...not giving the ending away.Ultimately, we get a new (to me, anyway) spin on the tale when we find out how Dracula was created, and why silver and sunlight and crucifixes and holy water are feared and hated objects to Vampiredom. It's a somewhat elegant answer, but it can't satisfy for a lackluster preamble to the revelation.Justine Waddell doesn't do much with her role. Christopher Plummer is rather wasted. Jonny Lee Miller has a few cute lines, but is kind of disposable, if likable. Omar Epps didnt' get a chance to do anything worth watching. (He's much better on HOUSE, where he gets some real characterization and infinitely better dialogue.)So, there's really only ONE reason to watch this film: Gerard Butler.Now, putting aside for the moment that it's truly bizarre to have Dracula speak in a Scottish accent--fetching, but odd--one can overcome this oddity by the sheer personal magnetism of the man. He makes clunky lines shine through overwhelming emotive power, some real acting chops, and the physical presence to carry off the role. Oh, if they'd only put better lines into his mouth, and not just sharp canines! Only at the end does he really get to speak and emote and burn. It's lovely to watch, for however briefly. A genuinely excellent choice for Dracula, except that Scottish accent. Weird.If you're a Butlerian Crushgirl--by all means, rent or buy this. The moments with Mr. Butler are worth the price. When he sniffs Mary, it's the kind of fully-dressed erotic moment that puts all the nude scenes in cinema to shame, and it proves that when you have people with intensity and charisma and screen "itness", an expression, a breathy phrase, these are more sensual than a million displays of nakedness and groaning.If you're not a G.B. fan, or a serious Jonny Lee or Plummer or whomever else in the film fan, skip it. It's just not very good movie-making. All it's got in the end is the cool historical twist and Gerry Butler. For some of you, that may be enough.Mir

I had only seen two works by Miyazaki prior to Princess Mononoke. I already knew that Studio Ghibli produced really terrific anime, and that Miyazaki had a knack for presenting film moments that make us sign in that part of us that senses wonder.This film has, bar none other, one of the most enthrallingly magical sequences I have ever seen: the section in the heart of the forest where we see the forest spirit as NightWalker. These few cinematic moments were, to me as a Christian, almost holy. The film is of a different myth/religion, but it captures that ineffable, that transcendant, that wordless experience where part of you KNOWS that there is truth there, that there is something beyond atoms and molecules, and it is powerful and necessary and benevolent (although it can destroy, as we later see with the Forest Spirit). It is a moment that made me think of 60's psychedlia--a bit--and the special taste of clean night winds in moonlight--a bit--and the way you feel when you've prayed a powerful prayer.You have to see it to understand. It's the combination of color, music, pacing, editing, expression, and the sheer otherness of this deity (I'm not Japanese, so the Forest Spirit, tree spirits, these things have a strangeness that was exhilirating.) I don't really know how to analyze properly how Miyazaki did it, but he captures a holy moment that transcends the story itself. Amazing.Anyway, this site has numerous summaries of the plot. I'll spare you mine. I'll simply say that the outworking of this quest story, a story of man vs. nature, man vs himself, and the place of humanity within the natural context, is very powerful and extremely beautiful. Even dubbed, you will be captivated.There is a moment near the end where there is this pause--many seconds passing when you wait, wait, wait and the screen seems not to change. And you find yourself hoping, praying for a change. And when the first perceptible changes come, it's such a relief. Such an answer to prayer.This film is like an answer to prayer. It says things we need to listen to, and it can speak to folks outside of the Japanese culture and the nature religions. Good is sometimes supremely good here, and evil is...not always purely evil. Sometimes, it's just ignorant or selfish or unthinking...or somehow motivated by higher motives. And that shows a filmmaker with compassion and understanding of how people work. And of how the larger cosmos works, too.I can't recommend it too strongly. A work of art.Mir

I'm a middle-aged gal with super-curly, prone to frizz hair. I have bought and tried so, so many shampoos (and conditioners) in the hope of finding something to make my wild hair manageable without having to pile on a gazillion post-shower products. I imagine I've spent oodles of cash over the years trying the "designer" products from Aveda and Biolage to Matrix and Paul Mitchell to Redken and on and on. I've also tried cheaper ones (Dove, Clairol, etc).This one is excellent. I buy the restoratives frizz contol in conditioner, too.The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. The lather is generous. And the result is very nice, indeed. My hair will never be shining cascade of smooth strands. Just too curly for that. But with this product, I find that it's easier to blow-dry and have the hair feel softer, sleeker, and less prone (though never NOT prone) to frizzing in humidity. (Granted, when you have mind-of-its-own hair, addig stuff like Paul Mitchell styling lotion and Biosilk just adds to the effectiveness of the Pantene products, I find. It all adds up to help manage the hard-to-manage.)I'm pleased with this product and hope they (the folks at Pantene) continue to produce great stuff for curly, dry, frizz-prone hair that is reasonably priced. (Let's face it, high-end, "designer" hair care can get wacky pricey.)Proof I like this a lot: I"ve started getting rid of the other shampoos in my shower stall, and I have a back-up pair of the shampoo/conditioner in my hall closet. Just so I don't run out.Bonus Points: I have extremely allergy/dermatitis prone skin. So much so that I have to use Cetaphil on my face rather than regular soaps or facial cleansers, can't wear mousse in my hair, can't wear eye make-up of any kind or most blushers, and have to test everything or risk a violent reaction. This shampoo (so far, knock wood) hasn't made my scalp itch or get scaly. It seems to work well for this sensitive-skinned gal.Very nice. Recommended.

I first was exposed to THE DRESDEN FILES via the tv show (which I don't like), and then picked up the first novel (which I loved), and decided to ditch the show and stay with the books.Number two in the series affirms I made a good decision. FOOL MOON took me a while to get into. I just don't go for werewolf stories. I've read a couple of wolfish novels and they didn't work for me. But I plugged along and soon enough the Harry magic took over.In this installment, Harry basically makes enemies of just about everyone (except hot reporter Susan). Murphy wants him behind bars, an assortment of wolfen characters--from all the branches of werewolfdom--are out to get him, and even a demon summoned for aid ends up showing a nastier side than Harry expects. One thing Butcher is a master of is getting Harry into the worst scrapes imaginable, so that we, the readers, think, "Oh, no, he's doomed!" even when we know he CAN'T BE DOOMED, cause, hey, he's the protagonist. And yet, there it is. Harry...rock..hard place...and a really creepy loup garou baring its fangs. Add the reappearance of Gentleman Johnny Marcone up to his usual no-good, and Harry is having a very, very , very bad series of days.But it's such fun to see how he'll survive.This book has some incredibly exciting moments. The rampage in the police station is harrowing. REally, really harrowing. The demon summoning is informative and, in Butcher's usual fashion, mixes the dark with the humorous. And the climactic battle brings everyone in for the big and bloody fight, and it shows us a side of Harry we haven't seen yet, and one that was exciting and scary to behold.The ending portends even greater trouble ahead for our dear, battered, bruised, lacerated, depleted, but still up for a Susan-snog Harry. Woohoo. I can't wait.So, okay, there's at least one werewolf novel that I truly enjoyed. Color me surprised.Can't wait to get into Dresden #3. This series is addictive. (Unlike the tv show, which just doesn't grab me, though I've tried, really tried, to get into it.)Mir

I bought this for an occasion, and it was a dream. Melted perfectly in the microwave--you do NOT need a fondue apparatus. Just nuke it.You can nuke it in the bag, or pour some out and nuke the dish. Great either way. Lovely creaminess, nice dark chocolate flavor (not overpowering), yum.And the small niblets are great in a candy dish, fine for snacking, too. Not as intensely dark chocolate for snacking (the fat content is high for it to melt perfectly). But when it tastes fine in the hand, you know it'll taste good on your strawberry or dried fig or bits of angel food cake or banana disc or whatever.So, to recap: 1. ease of use 2. nice flavor 3. can be a snack when unmelted 4. comes in a big bag that makes a huge amount, or you can use some now and put some away for the next family occasion. (Since it comes in a two-pack, I gave one pack away as a gift.)I'd use it again. No problem.OH, and that previous poster who said that the packaging was devious? I have no idea what that was about. I got the exact package shown above in the amazon image of this fondue chocolate, and I didn't get 2 bags with big blocks. I got just what is shown. Two bags full of nice, discreet, fresh, tasty, very small circles/discs of dark chocolate. Not a big block of chocolate. Perhaps that reviewer's chocolate got overheated and melted on route? I dunno. But I got exactly what was promised and was quite, quite satisfied.

Imagine this:You're a child. The school bully has it for you no matter how many non-violent ways you avoid him or attempt to weaken or discourage him. When he comes for you, he comes for you hard. You get damaged. One day, he's really mad and gunning for you. You sense in every cell that this will be the day you will be badly broken or die. He's not just gonna hit you once. He's got a gang and he's gonna pound you to a bloody, maybe unbreathing, pulp.What do you do?Imagine that adults are of no use in this situation. You can't call the principal or the security guard or your parents or the cops.You're alone, facing brutes who will happily turn you into human compost.What do you do?How much action does "surviving" justify?Depending on how you answer this, you may or may not like or love or respect the classic, best-selling, rivetting, page-turner that is ENDER'S GAME, winner of both the Hugo and Nebula. (The sequel won both as well.)ENDER'S GAME is one of the most accessible of sci-fi classics. The straight-forward prose rises to something higher and magical only in spots, but its page-turning plot and rivetting boy-hero keep you reading. Card created a highly-sympathetic character in a horrible situation to which we, nevertheless, become addicted spectators.It's not a novel that makes you stop and admire the prose, although I did go back, later, and see how he made me feel so strongly in some parts with such unvarnished writing. The storytelling skill and the narrative drive are such that if you aren't kept up into the wee hours, desperate to finish, something's not wrong with the story. It's wrong with you.Yes, there you have it. You. Not the novel.And I'm only half-kidding.So, back to the bully question. How do you answer?It's the question Ender Wiggin, our protagonist, must answer from the moment he's able to think and act. He is an extraordinary boy, six years old and so smart it brings him to the attention of the government, the same government that tested his elder siblings, his sister and brother, who are also remarkably gifted. Ender's life is a torment. His parents are ineffectual. His brother is a monster. His sister loves him, and mitigates some of his suffering, but she cannot guarantee he will not be killed. When Ender is approached to attend Battle School--effectively cutting him off from everyone in his family and on earth for years to come--the boy accepts. It is the way to save his own life.And the crux of the novel: What does one do when bullies threaten one's life. . . and the lives of one's family?What would you do?Ender is faced with bullies in the home, in school on Earth, and then in Battle School in space, and then beyond, in Command School, and then at last in a place where the biggest, scariest enemy isn't human, but an ant-like creature termed a "Bugger."What does one do to survive? How do we train the people who fight our biggest battles?And is it morality correct to train people THIS way, and to fight THAT way?I'm not usually big on militaristic novels. Battle strategy, fight after fight--that tends to bore me. In this case, I was eager for the next mock encounter. The zero-G battles between the "armies" of boys (and one girl) are exhilirating. And I was even eager for the next real confrontation between the bullies and Ender, because Ender is no ordinary boy and following his mental and emotional processing of his surroundings and options, and how he reaches his ultimate choices, is mesmerizing.Ultimate choices. It must come to that.I hear that the book is studied in some places specifically for the psychological insights into leadership. I'm not surprised.ENDER'S GAME has one of the most sublime endings of any novel I've read in this genre. It's powerful and mystical and dark and hopeful. I wept.But to get the pay-off of that beautiful ending, you've gotta live through what Ender lives through, and fear what he fears, and then know what he knows.I recommend this journey highly for any reader, even those not usually drawn to speculative fiction, even those (like me) who avoid child protagonists.If you're a writer who struggles with less than poetic sentences, you can learn from this how the power of a cracking good story brings magic to prose lacking in literary "artistic" levels and finesse. Card's prose gets out of the way of Ender's struggle, so that you can remain focused on the boy and his journey. And it works.Mirof MIRATHON blogAsst. Editor DRAGONS, KNIGHTS & ANGELS

I'm a Gaiman fan. Truth is, it's always a better bet to read his stuff than watch the dramatizations. If you wanted to watch something from Neil's head, MIRRORMASK, with some outstanding visuals and some very cool music, is a better bet. However, the plotting here is easier to follow, and Richard is more sympathetic and likable than the gal-lead-character in MIRRORMASK.Basically, this is the story of a man whose Good Samaritan act gets him in big, big, big trouble--life and death kind of trouble. The story takes place in two Londons--London above, which is normal London, and London Below, which is where things magical and mystical and dark and scary take place. It's ever so much less safe than London Above, even with all the perils of Big City living.This is a quest story. You know how that goes, someone wants something desperately, others come with skills and gifts band together to journey to the ultimate place of questing, each wanting something desperately; and then we follow them as they undergo ordeals, evade villains, battle monsters. And we hope they obtain their desires. Or at least, hope the good ones do. Like any quest story, some secrets are withheld, some allies are surprising, and the bad guys are very bad indeed. And someone always has to die, right? But who?The novel is creepy and funny, in the way that Gaiman manages to be creepy-funny. And you get a sense of Wizard of Oz gone very wrong.The DVD, which is video-quality, with some exceedingly dorky effects, is not gonna win any awards. Some of you may hate it. But if you concentrate on the likability and charisma of some of the actors (likable: Bakewell/charismatic: the guy who plays Carabas/lovely if disheveled: Laura Fraser), and how much you'll want the bad guys to get their comeuppances, you can enjoy this series. You just have to cut some slack for production quality and effects and sound. Just surrender to the cheesiness.However, if you want the full effect of scary-suspenseful-magical-sarcastic-amusing-fast-paced fun, buy the novel. It's a nifty urban fantasy from a master of modern fantasy.Mir

I happen to like both Gackt and Hyde. Not as a fangirl, but I like their music and weirdly "pretty boys" fashion senses. I especially appreciate L'Arc-En-Ciel's music. Hyde definitely can perform and sing.However, this movie was a mess. It needed better story structure and editing. It really was a strange experience in the mish-mosh way of telling a vampire-human bond (with homoerotic undertones) type of tale.Hyde plays a vampire who is pretty sick of his life and has a death wish. Gackt plays a juvenile delinquent in a futuristic Asian town who, with the aid of his vampire comrade, rises in the ranks.The fight scenes have a certain over-the-top appeal. And watching pretty-boy Gackt and his cheekbones and makeup and sexy-not-at-all-practical outfits for a ganster-guy is a bit surreal, but amusing. Hyde has terrible "cheap" hair in this one. What a shame. He's really attractive in that uberslender, pretty J-rock style when his hair is longer and dark.The story basically follows the emotional messses and joys of the bond between these two men as they deal with relationships, crime, ennui, dysfunctional families, allies, and enemies.Had a better writing/editing team gotten ahold of this, there might have been a good flick. This is a so-so flick, but definitely a must-see for fangirls and a could-be-good-see for those who appreciate two of J-Rock's cooler Bishies.Mir

I love Olivella, especially the hand soap. Such a fresh scent and cleans beautifully and can use it even to wash dishes. :)But for my face/body--not hands--I need fragrance free and gentler. The unfragranced Olivella bar is very good, but it has a strong olive smell (which, hey, makes sense, right?). Aptera is gentle, lightly, oh so lightly, lathers, leaves me very very clean, and has NO strong vegetal scent. It's not slimy--as some perceive Olivella. It's literally as close to fragrance free as an olive oil soap can get, I imagine. This is a plus, as I don't wanna smell like a salad if I can help it. :DGentle, effective, unfragranced. It's a great soap. My supersensitive, rashy, itch-prone skin loves this. No itch. No irritation.I went to the MOther Nature site and ordered a dozen of these little Greek OO soap bars(I had ordered two to try out and now I wanna stock up). If this goes on subscribe and save here, I'd subscribe. For sure. I hope Aptera starts to make other OO products. If they can make this terrific little bar, I'd like to see what their other OO products would be like.Enjoy,

The title--CREATURE TECH--refers to the nickname given by a small town to the specialty scientific research underground facility (Research Technical Institute) that's located in their midst.If you remember the ending to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, with that notion of this bureaucratic warehouse for assorted, mysterious objects (like the ark), that applies to CREATURE TECH. This facility studies these crated up objects or creatures or apparati that no one knows what they are exactly, but they're something weird.So, the graphic novel starts with this really wacky science guy way back when with an eel fetish, who has made a deal with a demon (who assists him in the lab/observatory) as he's luring a very odd thing to earth: some kind of giant space eel. It's quite funny. It doesn't end well for mad scientist dude and his demon hand.Long time later (think a century plus) and our genius scientist atheist hero, who's dad is a preacher, is sent to work at CREATURE TECH, which is located in his old hometown. He doesn't wanna go back there, to that lab, since it's where his dad worked before going on to his ministerial duties.AND NOW, the wacky, weird fun gets going.You meet the odd, but oddly endearing, townfolk, who don't like the standoffish protagonist much. There's the handicapped girl who tugs at the hero's heart. His father the preacher, who loves his son and wants him to know Jesus. The kindly rednecks unfazed by the giant mutant bug they end up adopting. And the dead mad scientist, who comes back with the help of the Shroud of Turin (an object in one of the crates at CTI.)Our hero has to battle near death, a symbiote who isn't as simplistic as one might first think, an effete English vampire dude, hellcats--and in the process learn about his dad, love, neighborliness, and God.This is a seriously cool graphic novel. It's got a solid Christian heart and an off-kilter sense of humor. (If you don't laugh snot out of your nose at what happens to the butcher's meat when the Shroud comes into play, well...your humor meter need calibrating.)I've since acquired a couple more TenNapel works. The guy is whack, in a very good way.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.How messed up is this?I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm. I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.But I still miss old Zico.Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes "just like" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon, so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B; will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is "natural" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to "optimize" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's "optimized" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to "optimize." (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under "Todd O'Connor". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by "Todd O'Connor" and under Alio "Alio"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio "Alio" confirming the fake identity.)

I first reviewed Zico (this product, this page) in Nov of 2006, as one of its earliest reviewers. I gave it four stars back then. In my mind, I was comparing it to fresh coconut water (which is available here in Miami and I drink when I can).I deleted that old review and am rereviewing it as a 5-star product. After trying half dozen different coconut waters in cans and cartons, I keep coming back to Zico. In fact, I subscribed to it and get a case monthly (and sometimes, I order two cases).This is really the best of the lot offered on Amazon (and I have ordered O.N.E and Vita Coco when they came on sale here). I even had a taste test at one--drinking sips from all three, one by one. Zico beats the other two, easy.Here is the original review from 2006:~~The reviewers who say this is an acquired taste are correct. Most folks don't grow up drinking lovely coconut water, chilled, right out of the coconut shell. And that's a pity, because on a hot day, that does the trick better than soda or any other juice.Zico, while not being exactly like the real and unprocessed thing, is quite close. It's refreshing chilled, and it doesn't have the ton of sugar some brands add. (If you like it sweet, add your own Splenda and get sweetness without the extra calories most Americans like me don't need.) But honestly, it's good to go as is.I find it goes nicely with Thai foods, natural eats, and by itself after some sweaty work. Lovely. And good for the blood pressure.Now, can amazon get some more in stock please. I really need a couple more cases! ~~This is now a staple in my house, so I think it well-earned it's 5 Star RE-review. In fact, it's one of my pre-workout drinks, because the high Potassium content keeps cramps at bay when I'm really having a tough Pilates session with my trainer.Thanks, Zico. This is a top-notch product (and I just had a carton, too!) Please don't go out of business! I need my daily Zico fix!BTW, I don't much like the flavored varieties. In this case, original IS better.Enjoy...Mir

We gave up gluten a year and a half ago, and so no crackers/toast. But we still like crunchy snacks. I don't like to have a lot of corn snacks (GMO worries), so I hope plantains are safer from this. Not sure.In any case, these are pleasant. They don't have the same consistency as FRIED plantain chips, but they still have a very pleasant crunch and these are thick enough to work well in dips. The salt level is good, not too much. Each serving has 50 mg of sodium, and a whole 4 oz bag has 200 mg. On the plus side, plantains, like bananas, have lots of potassium, so one serving has 220 mg of K, and the whole bag has a whopping 880 mg. This balances out any sodium and then some. Each serving has 1 gram of fiber. 4 grams for a whole bag.NOTE: THIS BAG HAS FOUR SERVINGS at 140 cals each serving. If you eat the whole bag, which is dang easy to do--and which I have done, shame on me--has 560 calories. Yep. ONE BAG = 560 calories. That's a meal's worth of calories for me and most women watching their weight. That's the same calories as in a Big Mac. So, I'd strongly recommend, unless you're one of those metabolic whizzes who burn up a ton of calories, that you portion this bag out.Low carbers will want to stay away. One serving (very small, 1/4th of this bag) is 20 grams.For those with high cholesterol/LDL issues, be aware that Palm Olein may slightly raise your LDL. You can google that.Otherwise, tastes nice, nice crunch, salted gently, good amount of potassium, no gluten. We enjoy these. And really, it's just three ingredients: plantains, palm olein, salt. I like simplicity in my snacks.

This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, "Huh? Downey?"I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.The effect of his "heart" is also quite nifty, though less complex.Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.) The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.Oh, yeah.And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.Mir

I'd pretty much given up on baked potato chips cause I hate that funky texture that, for instance, the Lays one has.Since I really love the organic Kettle Chips in chipotle flavor, I decided to give these a go. I got the lightly salted first, and the texture was great. They were very nearly like regular. (A very minimal difference). Crispy, potato-y. Nice.I then ordered these, and I love them. Much tastier than the somewhat bland "lightly salted" regular ones. They're sweet and smoky. A very nice barbecue flavor, I have to admit.I really hope they make the chipotle flavor in baked (and organic). I'd buy those in a heartbeat.So, for folks looking for a non-fried potato chip alternative (great for brown bagging lunch, four servings to a bag makes them more economical), I recommend the Kettle Bakes. Very good product.Mir

You certainly don't have to be Japanese to enjoy this marvel of animated film-making. (Although thanks to the reviewer who gave explanations for some of the details. I really appreciate knowing what those candy things are that so delight the soot ball creatures.)As with all the Miyazaki films I've seen--and much loved--you start with some time in the protagonist's normal, non-magical world (whether a long time or short, depending on the film.) Here, we are in a car with Chigiro and her parents, as they are on their way to a new home. Chigiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, but her parents tell her she should look at it as an adventure, as all new places are adventures.Oh, how prophetic.They pass a plot of grassy land by the side of the road cluttered with tiny shrines to a host of spirits. Another bit of foreshadowing. The parents are skeptical as they explain to Chigiro what they are.Then they park the car at a dead-end in the road, and enter a tunnel which takes them to an unusual, seemingly deserted place. Chigiro's papa says it's an abandoned amusement park. They explore this place that has echoes of Easter Island, with these partly toppled, partly buried huge stone faces. Then they find colorful streets crammed with restaurants, all empty. All but one. While no people are in sight, the restaurant brims with tempting delicacies (though, er, fishheads aren't my thing). Chigiro's parents begin to feast. She does not. She wanders...And the adventure officially BEGINS!This is no abandoned, mundane amusement park. This is the land of spirits, and a central point of action turns out to be a bathhouse where non-human creatures of all manner (some dreadful, some mysterious, some hilarious, all interesting) come to clean up and relax and feast.Chigiro receives the help of some of these non-humans, and is challenged and threatened by others, but there is no obvious villain, for, as in other Miyazaki works, characters are complex, with both good and not-so-good in their characters, whether it's self-indulgence or abuse of power or greed or gluttony or grudge-holding or whatever. And even good or well-meaning deeds can go all wrong. But, as with other Miyazaki works, compassion and bravery and hard work and sacrifice go a long, long way. And helping hands come when need is greatest. And a sort of benevolent providence watches over the world. This is what gives such magic to this work--as it does Princess Mononoke or My Neighbor Totoro, etc. Fine characterization, extraordinary visions of the magical, magnificent artistry, and a gentle heart that runs throughout.And there is always the too-too-too adorable or cute for words critter. In Totoro, it was the beasts themselves (especially chibi) and the cute soot critters. In Mononoke it was the tree spirits that made me laugh and laugh. Here, it's, yes, the cute little soot things again, but also the hilarious tiny bird with the mosquito-buzzing wings and the chubby, bouncy mouse with attitude. And even the radish monster was a hoot.I love the manifestations of gentleness and generosity and goodness in Miyazaki's works. Here, Chigiro helps a Faceless Spirit whose loneliness is a palpable things. The ride in the train at night is evocative and blends a sort of sadness and hope and resolve. The music chosen for this exceptional sequence is perfect--a haunting piano piece. The scene with the Stink monster who is not what he seems is at first remarkably amusing, then remarkably surprising--and yes, again, magical.This is not a film you want to miss. It has strong family values (as does My Neighbor Totoro and Howl's Moving Castle), and hopefulness.It's just a total, utter treat for the eyes and ears and spirit of children and adults alike. But I especially recommend it for adults who've forgotten what it was like to be young and see wonders all around.

With my newly revived interest in old and new, well-done comic books-slash-graphic novels (think ASTONISHING X-MEN, think SANDMAN, think WATCHMEN, think SUPREME POWERS), I had to rush here to amazon.com for a copy of MARKED. I first saw it featured at novelist Chris Well's nifty blog. This re-imagination of the gospel of Mark sounded like something I should "taste and see."It arrived on a Friday. I read it the next Saturday, in one sitting. Loved it.Why?MARKED is clever. It's got attitude. It's got gentle moments of compassion. It's got strong visuals that mix a bag of emotions together and toss them at you. It's got humor. It captures the essence of what the evangelist wrote: a very active Son of God, a very troubled world, imperfect followers, even more imperfect antagonists, wisdom, courage, mercy, grace, death, and victory over death.I recommend it.I dare you not to laugh at mad-eyed John the Baptizer and the running headlines that cover the main events of that prophet's activities--even as you'll be horrified (rightly so) by the front page spread of his demise and its timeliness given some of our recent front page news. I dare you not to be thrilled at some really fine creative moments, such as the Gadarene's encounter with the Christ or the incident of transfiguration on the mount. I dare you not to feel ferklempt over the incident of Christ's meeting with the leper. I dare you not to holler, "Cool!" every few pages. And do tell me if you've seen the resurrection handled anywhere quite like this, ever. I haven't. I had to actually stop and ...STOP. No, really, I had one of those blank moments of, "What?" And I had to think. I like when creative folk make me stop and think. I like when creative folk stir things up. Steve Ross achieves this with MARKED.The Mir's thumb is way up.Side Note: You can also play, "Find the famous person" with this. Can you find a great black leader? Can you find the is-he-dead-or-isn't-he rocker? Anyone else?Shameless Gift Suggestion: Christmas is upon us. If you have a comic book lover in your family, of if you know a reader who needs to be slapped with a zingy graphical gospel that will whet their appetite for a visit to the original, or if you just love someone and want to thrill them, get this as a gift for that person.A slightly different version of this review with helpful links to an article with Steve Ross and to Chris Well's Nifty Blog may be found at: http://mirathon.blogspot.comMir

I was at first wary of trying this due to being fragranced, however, this is great stuff.I have been using this lately as a hand soap--not a body or facial wash-- and I keep it in the kitchen. I always look forward to the wonderful burst of scent that I can best describe and "perky, bright, and clean". It's neither floral or purely herbal. Have no idea what the classification of the scent is, but I love it.And I love how my hands aren't red and itchy anymore. I wash my hands A LOT, dozens of times a day, so having something that's effective for cleaning but also gentle matters. I use a non-fragranced castile olive oil soap for my body, Cetaphil for my face, and this for general hand washing.And, since it's in the kitchen, I have occasionally squirted it on a sponge and washed cups with it or stinky lunch tupperware my hubby brings home. Works great for that, too.I ordered from a different site due to a better price over there, and I just reordered some yesterday. This will be a staple in my house.

I'm sort of new to anime, only caught a few over the last two years. But I've been ill, so I've been using my ROKU while wheezing on the couch, and I've been enjoying some anime from the last few years that I didn't see the first time round, such as Saiyuki and some of the early episodes of Bleach.I added this one to my line-up, and yesterday, I caught a little over half of the episodes in one sitting. Yep, that's like 5 hours of this in one go. I wouldn't have done that had I not been drawn in to the story of the black-clad, black-hatted, mecha-controlling loner on a revenge quest to get the Clawed Man who killed his bride. Not the most original plot, but it's definitely fitting for the west-meets-east-meets-a-little-steampunk sort of tale. It's got humor, action, family issues, and adventure. I like it.Yes, it is a going from town to town chasing Claw-Man thing, helping people (no matter how initially reluctantly) along the way. Van may try to be aloof, but he ends up picking up sidekicks and aiding the oppresssed, all the same. And he has another "armored" fella out to kill the Claw competing with him. So, the race is on.As I said, I'm over halfway done, and I found the 14 episodes engaging and the action fun and the humor not irritating (like some anime humor can get with the over-the-top cutesiness or dopeyness).Obviously, other reviewers have a more broad anime perspective with which to judge/compare/find faults. As a newbie anime-watcher, I think this is a fun series and I want to see what happens to the characters. I even like the weird intro music that starts with taiko drumming and segues into a sort of Western-retro-theme updated for anime.Mileages vary, right?Mir

These did not have the Corelle texture we're all accustomed to. These are a rougher sort of stoneware. But I've had them for years now. I used them to put my fresh fruit--apples, pears, oranges, bananas--on the table. I think they have a rustic charm and enjoy them. But don't expect the Corelle typical feel/look.

I ordered the case due to the five-star review and the good pricing here on Amazon.Well, I'm stuck with these packages now of noodles I don't want to eat again. I've had healthier, whole grain, even organic versions of pasta/noodles that manage to preserve a nice flavor and normalish texture.These did not. The graininess is offputting. There is no nice pasta/noodle flavor. It just like wet cardboard.At least they're good until 2010. I may find a recipe that they'll work with. Or I can start giving them away, package by package. :)Mir

The double feature (both versions, silent and color) were on last night on TCM. I saw part of the silent film one and was distracted. But I was totally enthralled by the color one. I really thought I'd be bored, but I could not take my eyes from this beautiful, beautiful film and its increasingly captivating story.The other reviewers have synopsized the plot--Kabuki traveling troupe, its leader returned to play in the town where a former lover and his illegitimate son reside, his desire for a "higher status" and more conventional life for his son, the way jealousy (of current mistress and lead actress) leads to actions that totally send upheaval, emotional and career, into father/actor's life.Visually, this is worth the rental or DVD price. The way sets and scenes are set up--really, it's a feast. The details of life in this seaside city--the barber, the whorehouse, the former lover's establishment--where she's seen serving food and warm sake, and watching her prepare the small bottles of sake, her posture, her presentation, has a charm all its own--small and rather quiet pace, in contrast to the "hammyness" of the theater and rogueish quality of the male actors and almost heart-breakingly desperate seductiveness of the actresses, mixed in with all sorts of motives and burdens. It's really a strong, strong film and achingly beautiful.You feel sad, but not hopeless when its done. Life goes on.I'm so glad I didn't blow this film off, thinking it'd be dreary and dull. Oh, my. It's wonderful!

This is fine. I'll keep it to use during hurricane season, cause it's easy to heat water with sterno or on a grill and pour into this and make a breakfast cuppa (when the power is out).But I'm not getting the "best coffee I ever had" vibe. Seriously. I tried several different blends and I'm not impressed. It's not bitter, sure, but it's also not that great. I may be doing something off (I tried different levels of heatness for the coffee, too).I like the ease of use. It's easy to wash. It doesn't take a lot of space. But, frankly, the last two non-gourmet, utilitarian coffeemakers I've had (one drip, one pod) both made better coffee.So, just okay.

I gave up sugar (mostly 99% of the time) a bit over a year ago. For a while, I just didn't really have treats. Saw these in the drugstore and got some. Ya know, they do taste like the YPP we know and love. Nice and minty and chocolatey. BUT....The texture is just not the nice one associated with the original. This lacks that creaminess and...well...the texture magic. These are dryer...er...it's hard to describe, but it's not a lovely textural experience.Hence the 3 stars.Also, I wouldn't recommend more than one, two max at a pop. The sweetener they use will make you visit the bathroom and gurgle you up in more than minimal quantities. Well, they do me, anyway.But, for sugar avoiders, one of these once in a while after a meal is rather nice. :DNow, if they could just use a less gas-making sweetener like, say, erythritol or sucralose.

I'm a fan of Mr. Gaiman's. I think he's got a terrific imagination and the writing chops to do those ideas justice. That's why I had such immense hopes for MIRRORMASK.I'm a bit disappointed.If you read some of the reviews here, you know the story: Artistic, cute girl in conflict with parents (who own and work in a funky little circus), finds herself in an alternate (dream?) world threatned by a dark and devouring menace. She also happens to resemble (a lot) a princess of this world. With the help of a humorous, if cowardly, ally, she seeks a way back home and the object that will help the stricken queen of that world, who looks just like her mum.If you've read the other reviews, you notice there's a pattern in responses. It's good to notice this pattern, because it's a clue that will tell you where you may end up on the "love it" or "huh?" spectrum. Here's the pattern: The five star gushfests, full of glowing delight at all things Mirrormasky versus the ones that say something is lacking in the story, but hey, cool for the eyes and ears.I fall into the latter camp. Lacking, but cool.I couldn't ask for more delicious visuals. What artistry! The moodiness. The magic. The surrealistic feast of it. I can't praise it highly enough.The jazz music that weaves throughout is also exceptionally pleasing. Even the very strange--but oddly "right" and enjoyable-version of "Close to You" works. Kudos to whoever put the music together.Of course, there are those imaginative moments in a queer dream world one comes to expect from the author of the SANDMAN comics and the down-the-sewer-hole quest of NEVERWHERE (Clearly, Mr. Gaiman is intrigued by dreamworlds and quests for keys and doorways.) Books fly off to the library when they feel rejected. Boulder creatures with a hint of Botero playfulness and roundness float about, and we can't figure out why, but it makes a queer sort of sense that they do. Fairy tale and mythic elements make their appearance--the twin queens or dark and light, the sleeping beauty, the Shadows, the dark, the tower, the riddles from sphinxes, the masks. (Only these sphinxes and masks both manage to be amusing and threatening simultaneously, also something that seems a Gaiman trademark.) Playful, very British, bits of dialogue show up.And yet I was not at all emotionally engaged about the conflict. I didn't much care for the young heroine at a gut level. Aesthetically, yes. I was captured. I even laughed in various bits. (Gosh, I adored those albino ape-meets-silly-bird things called Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,e tc, and Malcolm.) But I did't really care if Helena got out of the Mirror World or not. I didn't feel invested or touched where I should have been given her circumstance: in my heart.If you can sit back and revel in a nifty jazzy score and chomp from a brimming cornucopia of visual yumyummies, then you really should see this(rented or purchased). Oh, yes. Sometimes, having two senses supremely satisfied will do, especially when so much out there doesn't supply wonder and magic for one, single, yearning sense.Mir(...)

FIREWORKS is, in the main, a salvation story imbedded in a romance that's part Southwestern-Gal-in-Alabama/fish-out-of-water tale blended with a leisurely-solved mystery.( It's pretty easy to figure out who did what and even why.)FIREWORKS opens with a scary pyrotechnic mishap that nearly kills Quinn Baldwin, the owner of the company staging the show. No one is hurt, but a lot of damage is done to a key civic edifice. Even though authorities call the mishap an "accident," the insurance company receives an anonymous letter saying otherwise. And so, pretty, blond, leggy Susannah Tait, multi-degreed explosives expert and investigator, is dispatched to find out what happened and, her boss hopes, nail Quinn so that the insurance company is off the hook moolah-wise.The rest of the novel is a strolling Christian romance. Quinn and Susannah get to know each other, while, Susannah's deceit becomes a burden. (She befriends Quinn to get info, slips into his circle of friends, and must hold up her deception.)She falls under the spell of the man, the city, the people, the donuts, and the God who hovers over her life like a lover waiting to be noticed.To non-Christians, this novel will come across as decidedly preachy. Almost every significant character--from her landlady to her brother (who only shows up via phone calls)--is a strong believer, and all of these are out to get Susannah converted.Outsiders don't understand the evangelistic fervor we Southern Evangelicals can display in real life. Within the confines of a novel that, naturally, compresses major incidents, having a good percentage of the scenes relate to getting Susannah to surrender to Jesus could leave a less than devout reader feeling a bit overwhelmed, religiously speaking.However, once I said to myself, "Okay, the real romance here is between Susannah and the God who is wooing her through his people, not between Susannah and Quinn," I was able to settle enjoyably into the tale. That's the key. Tell yourself, "This is a God-courting-Susannah story." It will fall into place. That's what the marketing should have been. The romance with Quinn has its own secondary place, and the mystery is a straggling third on the list.It took me well past a third into the book to feel the spell of the romance(s). Quinn is just too perfect in the early part. It's when we start seeing his vulnerability--his first fib, even--that we can connect. Ah, see, he's human. Susannah is likable, although I hated that she was turned into something of a "Southern Girly-Girl". I understand the metaphor the author is using there, but it was nice to have her be the natural beauty without regard for the rituals of prettied up femininity.Susannah, btw, makes some serious missteps that made me question if she deserved all those educational letters after her name. One especially huge error, professionally speaking, is particularly annoying, and seemed to be a plot contrivance to allow her to hold off some information until the very end. But by then, I very much liked this young couple, as well as the older Elva May, and I also had a small fondness for the quirky secretary and Skeet and Dana. I liked spending a bit of time with the group.Beth White has a smooth, uncluttered style of writing. It doesn't force metaphors. It doesn't attempt stylistic flights. It's a gentle, clean style that will suit a quiet afternoon or evening's reading when your mood is matched by a novel that doesn't rush, doesn't offer anything offensive, and walks you unhurriedly beside a young woman as she encounters all sorts of new loves--God's love, a good man's love, the love of a faith community.This is a novel of a woman finding her place, and it's about a man learning lessons about forgiveness, even as both of them learn that what God brings into one's life, even when it seems awful, may ultimately turn out for a whole lotta good.Lovers of sweet Christian romances should enjoy this novel quite a bit. The romance is believable. The first kiss is utterly exhilirating and delightful to read. The book and its author, I believe, seek to honor a very traditional faith experience--an unsullied and honorable progression from unbelief to belief, from non-love to love--and it succeeds at that.If this is the sort of gentle read you gravitate to, I recommend it. For me, ie. someone who prefers more extreme fiction, it provided a few hours of tenderness and uncomplicated storytelling. And that's not at all a bad thing now and then . . . for anyone.Mir's rating of the various components of FIREWORKS:The mystery: 2.5 starsThe romance: 3.5 starsThe spiritual journey: 4 starsOVERALL RATING: 3.5 out o 5 starsMir[...]

Twinings Orange Pekoe has for years and years been my go-to tea for iced "regular" tea (and by regular I mean not fruity or herbally or flavored). It has a gorgeous, gorgeous color and a flavor that seems to brighten with ice. And it's great hot with some milk or cream. When I'm sick, I go through boxes of this stuff and it's a comfort beverage for me.However, I stopped buying it for a while. After the box design changed, I twice got batches that were, no other way to put it, tasteless. I mean, nothing. Watery tea. Crappy iced tea. Flat, not rounded and rich. I was heartbroken and went in search of other teas. Even went back to reliable old Lipton.But recently, I went to an Italian market, saw it on the shelf, and on impulse tried it again. It was back to being great. So, I got this 6 box supply here for a decent price. I'm back to my happy, happy iced tea experience.I don't know what the heck went wrong with the tea that put me on a Twinings hiatus, but that was weird. I see someone else on here (Rebecca Bryant reviewer) had a similar experience. Huh.Well, it's good now. :D Yay.

If I were less delighted with the moist and chewy texture and yummy sweet-but-not-too-sweet taste, I'd take a star off for building up false expectations. It may have pineapple flavor, but you won't taste it. Well, unless you have some sort of mutant supertaste ability. :)However, that aside: YUM!!!!!!! Prepare to chew a lot (but if you ever have had coconut meat, you know you do a ton of chewing.) Lots of fiber:4.8 grams per bar. Happy colon bonus!If you're watching your weight, beware of the calories. Don't go by the nutritional info listed up there on amazon as of 4/13. It's wrong. I have a bar right here and the calorie count for the whole bar is 264, with 16.9 grams of fat, 14.8 of them saturated. (Yeah, yeah, I've read about how the coconut oil saturated fat is different and supposedly good for the immune system/thyroid, etc... but for folks who watch their sat fat, there it is.)However, I can't fault the taste. Really nice. My mom used to make homemade coconut candy with fresh coconuts, Caribbean style, and it had that same chewiness and coconuttiness and simple list of ingredients. However, mom's had tons of sugar...it did verge on too sweet to my adult tongue (though not my child's taste buds). This is more suitable to my grown-up desires for less sugariness. These are organic and vegan and, well, fun.Now, if they could only make it more pineappley so it's like a pina colada, that would be nice, huh?Enjoy.

So far, seems to do okay for both (I'm a Curly Girl, and silk and satin pillowcases are useful to reduce hair frizz; I'm middle-aged, and my face creases in rather disturbing ways if the cotton pillowcase creases).The color I got, sage, is depicted accurately in the color swatch above. Nice feel. Fits my queen-sized pillows just fine. The hanging case, which I never use, is not distracting, like I thought it would be. I just tuck it in. I put this over my 1200 count Egyptian Cotton pillowcase in sage, and it matches the rest of my bedsheets/cases.I've washed it three times in with the sheets, cold water wash, regular heat dry. I don't know if that's a bad idea, but it's holding up fine, so far.I got these for five bucks less than the stated price of 24 now, with free shipping, too; and that was right here last year. If the price goes below 20, I'll buy another, otherwise, I'll make the two I got last time work as long as possible.Enjoy.

This is a novel of post-apocalyptic science fiction. Specifically, it's Christian Science Fiction, but it has the feel of fantasy; it should please both camps of devotees--fantasy lovers and sci-fi lovers.Set in a future world and after a series of catastrophic wars, OUTRIDERS shows the earth partially uninhabitable (with many toxic areas). Humanity is affected in some gruesome new ways. Tyranny, enslavement, rape, endless bloodshed--in other words the just as gruesome old ways persist.Because the main characters are believers in the One True God who loves and seeks out men and women to save, the God who offers his Holy Spirit to believers, and the God who preserves a remnant through all catastrophes in all ages, they have moral dilemmas in this novel. That's part of the fun of reading it. It's also instructive on a theological level, without doing it like a sermon. It arises naturally from characters put into plot-consistent situations.Buy this book. It's wonderful. Here's the lowdown:It's the future. Earth is damaged from catastrophic warfare. Christians were led by God to build an UNDERGROUND ARK where they were kept safe. After a time, OUTRIDERS--young, healthy, "called" believers--are sent out of the Ark with a mission. It's a hard life, a sort of future "frontier" existence, where danger takes many forms, human and inhuman.You follow two main characters through various adventures in this post-apocalyptic Earth setting: Niki, a relentless, powerful, warrior-woman. The kind you want to help you get through the wilderness, even if she's got a bit of an impatience-with-fools issue. And Brady, a smart, savvy leader with a godly man's heart and a warrior's way with a sword, who is dealing with some strong-willed folks in the OUTRIDER ranks, not to mention daily survival issues.They are members of one of various enclaves of Outriders that are strewn across the continent, whose task is to gather specimens of natural creation (as opposed to "transmogrified" or mutated creation) to send back to the Ark for study and preservation.Niki and Brady were two of the original 4 OUTRIDERS sent up to the surface. They're sent out of the Ark young (like 16). (And in a thrilling fashion you'll enjoy reading about. Scary, too.) They rely a great deal on Providence and their physical endurance and their wits.In this book, God is a very real presence and miracles are part of the daily life.So is constant danger from evil folks, notably Baron Alrod and his "sorcerer", Ghedo. They're always up to some brutal business, such as altering humans and animals into mutations that they can use in battle and to keep control over their territory. The villains are pretty unredeemable bad, which is not my fave kind of villain, as I do like to have motivation and more sides than just mean-mean-nasty-mean.Fortunately for the OUTRIDERS, they are endowed with God-provided tools (very, very cool ones) and special gifts (gifts of the Spirits transposed to a sci-fi world) that help them do their work on the surface and do good to non-Birthrighters who dwell topside.So, our gal Niki is, for the first time in her years as a first-ever Outrider (the toughest of the tough, she is), sent to retrieve a threesome of rookie outriders who are joining the Horesh outrider community. Things get complicated as the four trek to Horesh--going out of their way and far into trouble.Brady, who's back at the homefront (Horesh) while Niki is in the frozen lands with the rooks, repeated battles the evil Baron Alrod and his mogs (transmogrified critters and humans). Disobedience within Horesh brings conflicts deadlier than any Brady's faced before.Eventually, there comes a spiritual showdown.That's right: Holy spirit beings--God, angels--are real in this story, and so are evil spirit beings. And the people are not perfect--which is a good thing, or we'd be bored out of our skulls.The spiritual aspect, in fact, is handled beautifully in the novel. The Outriders are genuinely good-hearted folk, even with their sins and flaws. They care about outcasts and the downtrodden. They seek to liberate those in bondage. And we are shown how good motivation and sincerity are not always enough. Wisdom and obedience play a part. Humility and sacrifice, too.Mackel clearly cares about social issues. This book resonates with current events--euthanasia, stem cell and other genetic research, crass consumerism, out-of-control vanity, ecological issues.I found this book spiritually uplifting, and it was also vibrant and a ripping good read with a good heart!If you like science fiction/science-fantasy, I totally recommend this. Have patience through the confusing opening scenes: You will get oriented. You will be rewarded for your patience.Come on. Order it now! And then join me in waiting eagerly for book two of The Birthright Project.Mirof Mirathon blogasst editor at Dragons, Knights & AngelsA Magazine of Christian Science Fiction & Fantasy

Rather embarrassing to post this, but I found that this was okay as a lubricant--not great, not horrible--but it caused some wackiness in my Ph or something, cause this left me smelling oddly the next day. Sometimes, itchy, too. This occurred multiple times, always after using this. Discontinued using it, naturally, cause, hey, that's not something I need to deal with.I've since switched to Sliquid H2O (no glycerin, no paraben) and that works much better, no strange odors, decent lubrication. Since I switched, no more iffy smells or itch. Hooray.If middle age has affected that part of your, er, physiology, consider Sliquid over this. Much better product.

Similar to my experience with Amy's chili, I find this soup--though quite nice on its own--is really a treat with personalized tweaks. In my case, I add a bunch of chopped, fresh mushrooms, a bit more pepper, some garlic and onion powders, and some thyme (fresh if I have it, dried if not). That makes it special for me.I enjoyed this so much, I used the subscribe and save to get a case delivered. This is a comforting, flavorful soup that really is so much better than other brands of Cream of Mushroom I've tried, including Campbell's.While I have not used it yet in casseroles (though I plan to, as I found a nice recipe for chicken, egg noodle, pea and cream of mushroom casserole), I love having this handy for those afternoons when I just want some soup and a half-sandwich for lunch at home or a simple late meal when my tummy needs comforting.This and Amy's cream of tomato are among my top comfort soups on a can. Mmmm.Mir

I've had several of Amy's offerings, canned or frozen and etc. This is one of the better ones in cans. I hope by now they've got BPA free cans (not sure). I gave up canned soups for a while and focused on only fresh. But let's face it, sometimes, you get busy or lazy or both. And convenience foods are..well, convenient. So, in my freezer I have some Amy's organic enchiladas and in my pantry I have some soups. I really like the tomato bisque and I like this one.I customize all canned soups in some way. In this case, as it's a legume based soup, I like to add some pureed or mashed potato to thicken it (like 1/4 cup) and drizzle with olive oil. That makes it super nummy. The vegetables and lentils are in a good combo, not too much of one or the other. And it's not watery, which is nice.I so appreciate the NO GMOS, and if it's BPA free, all the better. This is one of those convenience items I like in my pantry for days when cooking just doesn't call to me. Open a can, customize with spices or add ins or EVOO and off you go. (Though no reason you can't enjoy it as is).

I can't eat full on tomato soups that often, as I flush and get itchy, but sometimes, it's worth the suffering for a nice bowl of tomato bisque--one of my all time fave soups, particularly if made fresh.I really like Amy's lower sodium version. It has bits of tomato, not tasteless like some lower salt soups can be, very tomatoey, and with some whole grain pasta tossed in for "bite" and a sprinkle of parmesan, it's a complete lunch. Add a salad or side of veggies and it's supper.If you like a creamier bisque, it's real easy to mix in one or two tablespoons of half-n-half and stir (not while bubbling, though). Granted, that makes it a less healthful option, but sometimes, I have a craving for a really creamy bisque. That does it for me.I may only be able to have tomato bisque a couple times a year due to my sensitivity, but this one satisfies.

I find that this is nice and filling and, being an Amy's product, gives me greater peace of mind about quality ingredients.However, let's be honest--this is still a rather bland chili offering. And I don't mean bland in the spicy-level way. I mean bland in the flavor way.YET..it's a very, very good base to customize. You got the nice ingredients, the plentiful beans, the tofu for protein (if you don't mind that). I add tomatoes, peppers, onions, and hot sauce or some sort of salsa, plus onion powder, to give it more flavor and texture. I will add some organic or low-fat shredded Mexican or cheddar on top for fun, too. I find once I tweak it, I really like it for lunch with some brown rice or organic tortillas.It works very nicely in a layer dip with chips, too.I appreciate the lower sodium levels, as I have high BP.I recommend this if you don't mind customizing your canned chili. Or, if you're used to bland canned food, then it could suit you "as is" from the can.Either way, if you're looking for a convenience food that's as wholesome as prepackaged stuff of this sort can be, this is a good bet. Give it a try. Play with it. It might become a staple for you.And if you like canned convenience foods, try Amy's Low-Sodium cream of tomato soup. I find that one very nice--comfort food. (The cream of mushroom is nice if you add more of your own fresh organic mushrooms and some spices--garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of thyme, black pepper, otherwise it also is rather bland.)Enjoy.Mir

I love this canned black bean chili. First, it appealed to me for being chili, as I adore the stuff. Next, I grew up eating black beans frequently, so love em. And I was attracted to the organic label.I've tried various Amy's products, frozen and canned. Not so crazy about a lot of her frozen meals or pasta sauce (ew), but her soups have a lot of good candidates. This is one of the best.It stands up fine on its own, but for a more complete protein, I like to add whole grain pasta or rice. Sometimes, I go the traditional route and add low fat cheddar and onions. Sometimes, low fat cheese and low fat sour cream.This is a staple in my pantry, cause I"m lazy about cooking. I do like to add stuff to it, but definitely a nice chili for a canned version.I am not sure if there is a light in sodium version--but I sure wish there was. Amy's has some nice lighter sodium stuff, and I would happily purchase a version of this one with less salt. I use this a lot for quickie lunches at home.Do be aware that ordering via amazon means you're gonna get some dented cans. Always happens to me. Occasionally, the dents are so bad, I have to throw out a can or more. The last time, they were mildly dented, but still, wish they'd package the stuff better. Dented cans are worrisome.MirUpdated Jan 2013: I still love this. I still wish they had a lower sodium one. I had some last night when a bean craving hit, and today I'm up 3 lbs just from sodium bloat. But the stuff is thick and comforting and nummy. I didn't post ingredients last time, so here is the ingredients list:Organic black beans, filtered water, organic onions, organic tomato puree, organic diced tomatoes, organic bell peppers, organic green chiles, organic high oleic safflower and/or sunflower oil, organic lime juice, sea salt, organic spices, organic garlic, black pepper.And as for mine and others concerns about the BPA in cans of soup/chili/etc, this is from Amy's site, taken Jan 31, 2013--Q. Does Amy's use cans with BPA liners?We are pleased to announce that as of March 1, 2012, Amy's has completely transitioned to cans using no BPA in the formulation of its liner. Even though BPA is omnipresent in the environment from a multitude of sources, testing levels on our canned products with the new liner are showing reduced BPA levels of less than 1 part per billion.

I spent a lot of time looking at Corelle patterns, and after buying some "a la carte" pieces of the highly praised SCANDIA in the Ultra line, I decided I wanted a patterned Ultra piece. I decided on this one. The whole time I waited for delivery, I worried that I'd chosen poorly--that it was too much lime color, that it was too busy in terms of pattern, that the bowl was weird.Well, they arrived, and I am delighted. The color is indeed--as another reviewer mentioned--less bright/limey than the picture here on amazon. It's still green and still bright, mind you, just a more pleasant shade than the pic here shows. It does have gradations of color and a certain "texturey" feel. I love, love the mugs, even though they don't feel "Corelle-y", which I like and have in another set of cups. I'm a klutz, so anything that cuts down the chance of breakage, I'm there.The ULTRA line is terrific. I had an old set of regular Corelle Callaway that I retired. Have pieces of another regular Corelle design (Heirloom Bloom). But the ULTRA line is a real delight. Thicker, more substantial. The Scandia is amazingly glossy and elegant for Corelle. And this one, the Rivage, has a wonderful "spring" feel with its green and budding leaves pattern. The green stripe has the effect of a nice bit of tablecloth/runner, like soft green linen. It's a pleasure to eat off these plates and drink my coffee/tea from the cups.Kudos to [...] for getting them to me FAST, for having a great reduced price, and for a no-fuss delivery that brought all the pieces to me unbroken. I'm very pleased. I only regret that I don't have space in my cabinets for another full set. These are nifty dishes. I may order a full set of SCANDIA or a compatible design to Rivage, and that way mix-n-match the 8 person setting so it's not totally matchy-matchy and has some eye interest. With the ULTRA line having spoiled me, I don't want to go back to regular Corelle. I hope they come out with more patterns. Good stuff.Mir

I got these on a today's deal, and I have to admit, I'm pleased with them. They are pretty, are actually a good size for my ears (not tiny-hard-to-see size).The colors are MUCH subtler than the picture amazon has here. But, that said, they still are attractive and usable. A good everyday sort of set of earrings. If you wear a lot of pastels or pale colors and like the feminine look of pearls, I say get it. Not expensive, discreet, pretty.Mir

I love this liquid soap. I had been having hand itch/rash from another soap, switched to this one: no more itch/rash issues. Leaves my hands smelling great--don't know how to describe the scent, but it's a fresh, perky scent that's not too girly or too herbally--and it doesn't make my hands feel dried out or itchy.I like the unfragranced bar soap version for my sensitive, itch-prone skin, but this one I love for a handwash and keep in the kitchen. I've even used it to wash cups and saucers.The look of the dispenser is attractive enough (ie, the label, fonts, colors), but the pump tends to shoot soap outwards, rather than downwards, and until I got used to that, I kept getting soap shooting across the sink. It also does "feel" as if it has some fragility. But the product itself is great.

I bought these cause I'm a chocolate snap lover, and I had been craving some. The lack of trans fats and description drew me in.Let's just say this: I took these over to a family party, and none of the kids liked it. NOT ONE. And most of the adults, the best they could say was, 'Eh.' I think two folks had more than one.I'd have to say skip these cookies. They don't make your mouth sing with chocolatey snappy joy.

I watch this movie periodically just to see how tremendously talented (and still, sadly, UNDERused by Hollywood) Brendan Fraser is.Basic Story with SPOILERS (remake of old B&W; drama, was a novel first, liberally changed in this comedic reinterpretation): Pregnant Protagonist meets pregnant lady and cute hubby on train. Train crashes. Preg. Protagonist is believed to be dead married lady (cause she had tried on wedding ring of lady), whose hubby happens to come from family with beaucoup bucks. She tries to play the part of "Mrs. Winterbourne", falls for brother of dead guy (the twin). Confusion and comedic events ensue. Happy ending. Wedding. Hurrah!So, now, my take on the weaknesses and strengths:Here you have a pretty mediocre script, an okay director, and, except for Rikki Lake, a really good lead cast. Rikki sucks. She sucks so bad that I wanted to take the original celluloid and edit it myself so she wasn't in any of the scenes, then edit in someone else. Someone who could, well, you see, maybe, ACT.If they had simply paired with Brendan someone with real acting chops and comedic timing, this would get 4 stars from me and would qualify as a decent little comedy. It gets one star for Shirley and two for Brendan. He manages to be romantic, funny and a bit sad, and boy, is he totally to die for in the tango scene. Women, prepare to swoon. He's adorably funny and touching in the "making a list of pros and con" scene.The biggest flaw in this film, hands down, is Rikki Lake. She simply has no onscreen charisma, negligible acting talent, and no comedic timing whatsoever. She can't hold up her end, so the movie doesn't rise. And she's totally painful to watch in some scenes. I mean, CRINGE painful. (That is not figurative. I actually cringed.) What a shame. Brendan is so good, he deserved a better partner. When Miss Lake was heavy, she got cast as a novelty actress. But I've seen her in Hairdo and in this flick, and she simply cannot act. Period. Stick to talk shows, Rikki.The movie has a "tv film" feel to it. If it weren't for Shirley and Brendan, you'd think you were watching a movie of the week. Well, I still recommend you watch it for the amazing Mr. Fraser. Hollywood needs to put this man in more funny or dramatic films. He's just got "it".Mir

Because the team of Powell and Pressburger are responsible for one of my very most favorite movies of all time (THE RED SHOES), and because they are the team behind some high quality oldies (BLACK NARCISSUS, THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD, I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING), I put A CANTERBURY TALE in my Netflix queue.In wartime England, three persons--a young woman and two soldiers about to set off to war--meet in a town near Canterbury, and end up trying to solve the mystery of The Glue Man, the unknown assailant who's been pouring glue on the hair of women who are out after dark. In solving the mystery, they become friends. Along with a local farmer-scholar, they end up journeying to Canterbury Cathedral, as sort of pilgrims, each with an unfilfilled longing or prayer. What they find there is more and quite different than they expected.Astonishingly good. Gorgeously done. Intimate, yet with large themes. Mystical, yet down-to-earth.I'd hate to give away too much, since I do recommend you catch this oldie. I will that the way they've tied in Chaucer's tale with a modern settings and concerns (for then, this was during WWII), and the way they offer a slice of British life from a bygone era, and the depiction of the inexorable pull of fate toward the ancient holy place--well, it's just what one expects from P & P. Highest quality film-making with excellent characterization and beautiful shots of another time and place.The actors aren't stars, which is good. One of the leads was just what he seemed to be: a U.S. army sergeant. The young woman who plays Allison has a healthy, sturdy attractiveness that isn't over-the-top Hollywood glamour. You believe her as someone who would love to live on a farm. The Brit off-to-war guy is energetic and mischievous and out to do the right thing as he sees it. The mysterious Mr. Colpepper seems very threatening and controlling in some scenes, and as if he were having visions in others, so that he ends up being fascinating and creepy and, ultimately, surprising. The film seems to imbue his character with an enigmatic depth that is hard to explain. It's just gotta be seen. You'll either loathe him or sympathize with him. But you won't remain neutral. And I found myself liking Sergeant Johnson and Allison so very much, and just wanting to cry at the for all of them.The ending is moving and satisfying, and the cinematography and direction is top-notch. I felt spiritually touched at the finale, and rewound it to see the scenes inside the cathedral again.It's a movie that makes room for an invisible, but active, God.

Kiki's Delivery Service has the same sort of optimistic delightfulness as that other much-beloved and much-praised Miyazaki offering, My Neighbor Totoro. It has a way of making you not only wish you were young again, but it actually makes you feel as if a few years (or decades) have fallen away and the world is all shiny again, and so are you.There is no villain. There is no terrible abuse or viciousness. This is a totally sparkly story of a young witch who is sent from home to get her training, which means traveling to a new town and living there for a year. (To some, that might sound rather harsh, like child labor or a dangerous lack of parenting wisdom.) You have to surrender yourself to the idea of this rite of passage, and that Kiki will be all right.She ends up with her cat, her radio, her purple witch's dress, her mother's trusty broom, in a new city, where she befriends a kindly bakery shop owner who lets her live in the attic. From there, Kiki embarks on a delivery service, taking packages on her broom. The story follows that journey in setting up her business and learning about her capabilities and flaws, as wella as her new city world.The magic is in the details of both the story and the artwork. The city is beautifully done, and the city feels like a welcoming European city, with some buildings as stately and rich as Viennese jewels and others having a more Mediterranean seaside feel. It's a city that you'd want to visit, and the artwork makes it accessible. The sky takes on astounding colors and depth at times. Small details of characterization in expression and movement--in both humans and animals--or in the setting--a bit of grocery that falls to the floor, the way toes are depicted--add to the richness and are so charming.And Kiki's a typical 13 year old of a more innocent age--she can be hasty, emotional, enthusiastic, helpful, worried about fashion, respectful of elders, and she is inately good and kind and industrious. (Miyazaki's films seem to uphold the value of kindness, compassion, and hard work quite a bit.) She finds out things about her own abilities, and she makes friends.Kirsten Dunst does a terrific job of voicing Kiki, and the tone has the ebullience and girlishness that's perfect for the characer. The late Phil Hartman is an amusing black cat familiar.It's a gentle story, but it's never boring. Even my 47 year old engineer husband found it a fun, sweet, watchable tale.There is this enveloping magic that I've found in Mr. Miyazaki's movies, whether it's My Neighbor Totoro or Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle, there is something in the combination of story and character and artwork that makes you feel the wonder again of being young and diverted by the adventures in magical worlds where good, ultimately, wins out over bad.This is the sort of film parents and kids can treasure together. And if you've seen or read or heard too many dark and terrible things, this is the sort of movie that restores a bit of youthful innocence.Highly Recommended.

This is a VERY good product. It does exactly what it should: provides a great friction-reducing layer on one's skin for shaving (I use it everywhere, legs, arms, armpits); doesn't irritate sensitive skin; softens.I have crazy sensitive skin prone to dermatitis and eczema. I can't wax (leaves me covered in red bumps.) I can't use those "tear hair out by the roots" depilators, cause they HURT! So, I shave. And this ultra calming Aveeno gel works. It just works without making me a bumpy, itchy mess.It will leave a ring around your tub if you do shower-shaving as I do. Prepare to have to rinse-scrub after each shave or just more often between showers.But...when you need a gentle, effective product, I guess you put up with those little inconveniences.I recommend this.Mir

Hubby and I both have teeth that can't handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip bread these days--and cereal, etc--but I don't mind using up some of my starch/carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use breakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels/toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar-free preserves (I use Nature's Hollow). They are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes.Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness.Wasa, please don't ever stop making these.I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle-aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don't pack on the salt.Thumbs up!Now, if they could make one that's like an everything bagel--an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion/garlic/sesame seed/poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.)Update: I don't eat gluten anymore, so I don't buy this product these days. For those who don't care about grains/gluten, I can still recommend it based on texture/taste/calories. But not for me as I'm trying to stay gluten-free. Be well...

Warning: Contains some spoilers for books one and two in the series~~Ever read a novel and the adrenaline starts spurting in your body and you keep going, "Wow!" as you read? Well, this conclusion to the fabulous fantasy series by John C. Wright did that to me. Now, that's not to minimize the fun, smarts, and utter enjoyability of books one and two in the Chronicles of Chaos. It's simply to assert how slam-bang and adventuresome and satisfying this one was: A perfect, awe-inducing finale.So, in book one we met our "orphans", who, through great smarts and innate powers (only just blossoming), manage to escape the clutches of the mythological beings holding them captive, including the sexy-bad-boy Boreas, alias Headmaster Boggin, and a really creepy Grendel. They've figured out they are much older than they seem to be and that they aren't students, but prisoners. They can't remember their true identities, but they have remnants of memories, and those memories bespeak of origins that are strange and wondrous. Despite their valiant attempt at freedom, they are recaptured, and their memories are erased. Ah, but a bit of Amelia monadal fiddling makes sure that we get to book two......where Amelia begins to regain her memories. Eventually, a successful escape ensues, along with further discoveries by our heroes and heroines of who they are and what they can do. Plus, a truly titanic encounter with the monstrous and beautiful and very, very dangerous Echidna (kicking scene!), before that book ends with the Olympian martial fleets coming at our intrepid heroes and heroines: Amelia (the first person narrator and inhabitor of multi-dimensions at will), Victor (Amelia's big first crush, our man of logic and matter manipulation), Vanity (the lovely one whose dreamship aids in their escapes and adventures, and whose boundary stone does some tres cool stuff), Quentin (our Dr. Strange of sorts, our magic-man with an honorable soul if some nasty apparati), and Colin (our randy bad-boy who needs to stay inspired to accomplish wonders, and who seriously wants him some Amelia).So, we open with our fugitives trying to escape the clutches of Mavors' (Mars/Ares) army of lizard-men and Atlanteans, and the mountainous, pyramidal ships of the war god that I thought were a delight to visualize. And I will offer no big spoilers here of a truly terrific series of adventures, discoveries, and mind-boggling battles. Just about anything I say would be a spoiler, given how packed this novel is and it's breathless pace.I will say that we get some lovely mixes of the fantastical-mythological with the science fictional, so that we are tripping in a real best called science-fantasy (in one sense of that classification), that gorgeous hybrid that Mr. Wright manages with dazzling deftness, and in particular in a segment of the novel that thrills with imaginative space travel. I dare you not to go, "WOW!"You'll see our fugitives in San Francisco, LA, back in England, on a deserted island, up beyond the stratosphere, down in dreamland, and wherever they go, trouble follows in ever-increasing and astonishing measure. I've never had such fun reading showdowns. I mean, geesh, wait til you get a load of these Maeanads. It gives girlpower a whole new spin.Along with some wonderful intellectual musings, some Christian allusions (oh, lord, how I felt utterly moved by the magnificent intrusions into the prelapsarian world), some randy coming-of-age antics, some very funny bits that had me barking--one has to adore Colin with his war cry of "Amelia Windrose!"--and some truly dark and terrifying moments when it seems as if there is no way our kids can win the day, then even darker and scarier ones when you think, "Okay, THIS TIME, they're done for," even if you know better. When the climactic showdown with the one who has manipulated people and events and plotted the demise of our "orphans" finally arrives, it's like being on the wildest, craziest ride in some fantastic amusement park run by a lunatic genius.But all rides end. Sigh.A quieter, but no less of a battle, conclusion lets us feel a true denouement (but not without leaving room for more Chaos stories, which I hope will come). The reader can feel satisfied because love, loyalty, cooperation, abilities, friendship, sacrifice, hard work, brilliant problem solving, and audacity do, indeed, bring an ending to smile about. Oh, happy day.Well, you can tell I loved TITANS OF CHAOS, right?If you like the dazzle of superpowered heroes in comic books, if you like science-fantasy, if Zelazny's AMBER series zinged you, if you like intellect that isn't stuffy, the high mixed with the low, if you want to see what Cupid/Eros would be like if he lived on the West Coast and had entrepreneurial leanings, if you loved Harry Potter and want to see how it might be fashioned if there were five Harrys, not just one, and the enemies were much more numerous and powerful than Voldemort, if you want to see what happenes when "kids" who can destroy an entire universe have to figure out the way to walk the tightest of tight ropes in order to survive themselves and not destroy Earth, this is the series for you.Recommended in a big, big, one might say TITANIC, way.

I had heard good things--great things--about MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO for years. I still avoided it. (I tend to avoid anime. My husband puts some on: I leave the room.) Plus, it looked as if it were for kiddies.I am an idiot. I could not have been more wrong.To summarize it--well, look around. The reviews are full of that: Father and two daughters of the Kutsakabe family move to countryside in Japan (circa 1950's) while their mother is recovering in a hospital (from some unspecified ailment, maybe TB?) and the girls discover they are neighbors to magical "trolls"--totoros--three of them, small and medium and very large! They learn the wonders of their new environs with the Totoros and they get a happy ending regarding their family situation, but in a way that will make you both smile and get moist in the eyes.Nothing complex. It's what the writer/director/artists do with this simple premise that adds up to soooooooooo much more.This film taps into the warmest, most human, most loving, gentlest, dreamiest bits of my young self that still hides inside my middle-aged self. It reminded me of what it was like to~have a dad I adored and who cared selflessly for me~ be young and see enchantments in the world~explore and be carefree physically~have fun with the simplest, new things, like a fresh bit of produce from a a plant in a pot or from someone's garden--which seemed like magic to me when I was young), or from a bath or from climbing a tree~be young and lost and afraid without family nearby~worry a beloved parent might die (as I feared when I was very, very young, like Mei, and my Papi was hospitalized.)I understand some of the critique about the vocals, but, geesh, get past it. It's hardly an issue in light of the amazing animation (just watch the girls, the little things, the details, that so absolutely prove that the artist(s) have observed young kids very, very carefully), the playfulness, the delights of the Totoros (I can't watch Chibi Totoro and not giggle. Physically unable to stop myself from just letting loose with a cascade of heeheehees!).It's a movie which opens with slow, establishing scenes of this new place for the family, but which soon utterly enraptures you with these darling girls and the weird but lovable Totoros and the kind, distracted Papa. The scene with Mei on Big Totoro's furry tummy is pure perfection. Watch her legs, the way she lays there and plays with Totoro's face. The way she scoots. The gorgeous bonding the ensues. The restfulness.And the scene at the bus stop/catbus stop: Wow. Look at the way the shadows and light are done. The hilarity of O Totoro and his leaf hat. The joy of raindrops on an umbrella. The sweetness of sleepy Mei and the unselfishness and kindness of Satsuki.The scene with the night ride: Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Who wouldn't want to be five or six again and ride on a Totoro's tummy through a moonlit night, over rice fields and camphor trees?If you have high BP, this movie will settle it down, it's such a bit of grace pouring on you. If you want something beautiful that fills you with a sense of nostalgia: This is it.Feel young again. Feel magic. Feel joy. Watch MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO.

One of my very fave fairy tales as a very young Mir was "The Goose Girl". I especially loved reading aloud the rhymes--'Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it/Sadly, sadly, would she rue it," and "Blow, wind, blow." I was horrified in that particular, sensitive way of children that someone would decapitate a lovely horse such as Falada, the beloved, talking horse of the princess protagonist. Clearly, evil was afoot if such a dastardly deed was conscionable. I imagined Curdken's chase for his cap. (In my chikdhood's version of the tale, that was his name. In other versions--and in this retelling--it's Conrad's hat that goes rolling over hill and dale, sparking his pursuit. And I delighted in the horrible, terrible justice that befell the villainess. Just thinking about it makes me feel 6 all over again, feeling the magic of the story--all the stories--and how to a child, all this was so plausible: that a horse should talk, that the lock of hair should speak (some versions have drops of blook on a hanky), that a princess should command the wind, that justice would prevail.Shannon Hale has taken that brief, bloody, magical tale that may be familiar to you and fleshed it out in a story written for a YA audience, but sufficiently skilled, lyrical, and well-plotted in the telling that an adult like me was engrossed and loath to put it down even to have supper.In this retelling, the Princess Anidora-Kiladra (Anifor short) is a misfit in her own family. Even as a newborn she evidenced a strangeness: She didn't open her eyes for three days, not until her aunt (gifted with a special "speech") spoke her into wide-eyedness. This hint of a special power of speaking is hinted at from the opening, but develops beautifully. We see the not-well-loved child, Princess Ani, grow close to her aunt, who can speak to animals. She learns the language of swans, she learns some of the bird dialects, and she senses something latent in herself, something she cannot fully enunciate.It turns out that out of political considerations (fear of war), the Queen--who has the gift of people speech, ie persuasive to humans) betroths Ani to the prince of the neighboring acquisitive, hawkish kingdom. En route (as in the fairy tale) Ani's lady in waiting, Selah, who is deceitful and potent in people speech, gains many of the guards to her side, and they mutiny. Ani must hide in the forest of this foreign land, where she is befriended by a forest widow and her son.Ani ends up, as the Princess in the original tale, working as a goose girl for the king whose son she had been fated to marry. Without a persuasive gift of speech of her own, she is at the mercy of the powers around her. From privilege to the lowest echelon of society. A drastic change of status.What will she do?She ponders how to fix what has been damaged (and it's more than just her status). And, in the process, she begins to develop her gift. She learns goose speech, which is (surprisingly) not like swan speech. It's a gift that will serve her well. The start of a new journey of acquisitions--of insight, of power, of perspective, of friends, of confidence.Through the treacheries and friendships and tests and hardships, she begins to understand what her privileged and curtailed palace life had kept her from learning. And she learns one very important thing: She can speak to the wind. The fairy tale glosses over this great gift. Hale develops it as part of the evolving plot and part of the evolving, maturing Ani.We know, from the fairy story, that she will get her prince, and their romance develops believably and sweetly in Hale's tale, somewhat reminiscent of EVER AFTER, the film retelling of Cinderella. We sense that her trials will only make her a better future ruler, one who has walked in the shoes of the poor and oppressed and outcast and unjustly accused.Because it is a fairy tale retold, we know the ending though not all the details of how to get there. The special pleasure here is in the details.A marvelous, magical story. RECOMMENDED for young and middle-aged and old.Mir of Mirathon blog

Let's see, the boom busted, what? Last year, and it's still sliding downhill.Here is a recent quote from Lereah himself from a May 6, 2008 Newsweek article about the housing market:"We're not at the bottom," he says. "[People] want it to be near the bottom, but we're not there yet. The leading indicators are still very bad. Pending home sales are still in bad shape. Mortgage applications are low ... There's still supply out there in abundance ... This thing is going to get worse before it gets better."And..."We're probably going to end up with a 20 percent [decline], but if I'm wrong it will be even more than that."Well, since the title of his book is clearly shown WRONG by current events, it would be advisable to skip this boatload of malarkey.

I've tried several cocoa powders, including Ghirardelli, Droste, Hershey's, and those you have to grate yourself like Luker, etc.But since I found this at Williams Sonoma, I'm hooked. This makes fabulous hot cocoa. For the last week, I've had a cup EVERY NIGHT (I follow the directions, mixing the cocoa in the cup, so many TBSP per 8 oz, etc). And it's just absolutely wonderful. Doesn't have the bitterness some have. Beautiful aroma and flavor. I need to get like a dozen cannisters of this. :)On the plus side, no alkalis. So, you get the heart healthy benefits. (If you're using the Dutch Process or alkalinized cocoas, your cocoa just isn't gonna do it health-wise for you, sorry.)Also on the plus side, no sugar. You sweeten this yourself. So, for the natural crowd who like stevia, go for it. For those like me who use Splenda, it tastes great with it. Or, if you like old-fashioned sucrose, knock yourself out. The benefit is you sweeten it to YOUR taste and not the manufacturer's (which I always find make hot chocolate mixes too, too, too sweet.)I wish amazon as a seller stocked this. iGourmet has outrageous--no, really, totally outrageous--shipping prices. It's like 12 bucks for a small cannister of cocoa that doesn't weigh that much. The price of the cocoa is in keeping, I think, with the quality. But the shipping is, as another reviewer stated, a rip-off. I won't buy from this seller as long as the shipping is this inflated. Another amazon seller has shipping at 8 bucks. Still high, I think, but more reasonable.So, if you can find it locally or amazon ever decides to stock it and send it with super saver or PRIME, get it that way. Or find someone who doesn't gouge with shipping.Recommended product. Not recommended seller.Mir

I seem to be a bit sensitive to vitamin C formulations that use regular C. Because of that, I switched to this years ago, as it has both the Quercetin that I need for allergy relief and the Ester C for general health without upsetting my acid-reflux prone digestive system. I have been able to take these even if all I have is a few sips of juice without a belly ache.Each capsule has 250 mg each of Ester C and Quercetin. It also has smaller amounts of calcium, bromelain, rutin, bioflavonoids, acerola, and rose hips.If you are someone who likes to supplement C and Quercetin, I do recommend this.Mir

I've used the Clinique brow pencil and powders and the Kevyn Aucoin ones the most. Like those. BUT THIS..I find myself reaching for this one more and more and my more expensive ones are being ignored.Hey, if cheap works, why pay 4 times the amount?I have almost black hair and nearly black eyebrows and lashes (I'm Latina, mixed race). My skin is MAC NC42 to 44. I give you these base color measures so when I say Dark Brown works beautifully and "naturally" for me, you see what I mean. It's not black...it's a very dark brown that isn't so harsh as to look weird.This one doesn't do as fine a line as some others, but I dont' have bushy eyebrows. Menopause and thyroid problems thinned out my eyebrows. I just use it to fill in the "blanks" >:). Works great. I have two and am ordering two more for back-up (I like one in my purse and one in the house.) I hardly ever need a touch-up.I will add that the gel is nice for those who have unruly and bushier type eyebrows. I don't use it. I tried it at first and got breakouts in my eyebrow line. If you have supersensitive skin, beware that. I used to use clear mascara when I was younger to do to my (then bushier) eyebrows what this does now. It's still a great idea for "setting" unruly brows. If you don't need that, skip it. (What I will use now and then is MAC's brow wax, which doesn't irritate my allergic skin but will slightly tame stray, oddly-angled eyebrow hairs).But the 5 stars is for the pencil part and (if you have tolerant skin) the gel is good, too.Hope they don't discontinue this. Seems when I find a cheaper product I like, it goes buy-bye in a year...

These are so exquisitely milled and pigmented that it's not irritating to my sensitive skin. I also only need a very little to make my cheeks pop, so it lasts and lasts.ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I'm an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me. I did find that two colors have become my staple blushes.For warm-tone days, I use EXHIBIT A, a matte blush that is scary in the pan (so brightly orange-red) that most women would think "Bozo the Clown". No, it works beautifully on my tone, brightening me (we olive toned women can look sallow and blah without a color pop). Fabulous.For cool days (and by cool I'm talking my color choices for clothes and lipstick, not weather), I like MATA HARI. It's a matte cool pink tone that is deep enough to show on my cheeks and give me a look that says "Healthful" or "just went for a quick jog and has blood circulating well". Nice.I plan to try CRAZED and TAOS, which seem to be shimmery cousins to my two faves (ie, one is warmer, one is cooler).I think the thing is to head to a store like Sephora and just try the shades. With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.NOTE: You really need a quality brush to get just enough pigment and deposit not too much pigment. That's my recommendation. These blushes do not come with little cheapo rough brushes like so many do. No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc. I use the MAC duo-fiber brush, smaller one, and it works very well with these strong shades.Yes, pricey. But I've gone through so many disappointing blushes in drugstore brands and even from some name brands, that it's a relief to find blushers that WORK for me and make me happy and don't make me itch!Hurrah for NARS.Mir

Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look "tired". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.

I got this a couple weeks ago after researching pod/single-serve coffeemakers. The ones that got higher ratings were also twice as much, so price entered into it. One other thing convinced me: no clean-up.I have a Melitta coffeemaker (what I used prior to getting the Fusion) and it ground up my fresh Torreo coffee beans, made me a lovely cup. HOwever, I hated cleaning the pot, cleaning the carafe that kept my half-pot of coffee warm, but not bitter, etc. My hubby doesn't drink coffee or cocoa or tea, so what I made, I drank. And since I made from one to two half-pots a day, it was a lot of cleaning up of grounds, carafe, pot. Hated it.So, the search for a single-use, easy clean up began. The clincher: I got to taste the Flavia Fusion House Blend at my surgeon's, and I enjoyed the medium type flavor of it (I'm not a dark roast kind of gal). Enjoyed it so much, I had two cups the next visit.Well, I've had my Flavia for a couple weeks now, and I have gotten to sample several of the coffees, the cocoa, and the Milky Way swirl. Here's my assessment:1. Coffees: If you're not a coffee gourmet, the coffee and teas are fine. I have previously tasted coffees that are up to 30 bucks a bag. My regulars were the Mocha Java and Estate Java and MOuntain Blend from Torreo Coffee, the beans to grind. Those were very nice, flavorful, medium coffees. The Flavia coffees are not up to that par. They rank more along with good coffees you can get at Starbucks or the supermarket types like Folgers or Maxwell House. Better than many I tried at some local beaneries, better than some national brands. Not as good as top of the line gourmet blends or single origins. Basically: Okay, adequaqte, satisfying, even delicious for non-uber-picky types.As mentioned, I like coffees in the medium (not bold or super dark) range. I tried the Sidamo, the Sumatra, the French Roast, the Columbian, the Costa Rica, and really, I'd only buy the Colombian again of those. The first two were awful to me. The French Roast had a burned taste. If you like dark or astringent coffee, maybe they're for you. Not for me. (Other reviewers here love the dark roasts, so, hey...YMMV)2. Teas: Green tea's okay. For tea that is ready in 30 seconds, I say hurrah. The Malawi tea is delicious hot or cold, and I can't tell you how great it is to have a hot cup of tea in seconds, no bag dripping or no leaves to clean up. I'm buying the Malawi again. It makes a great cup of iced. Brew it up in seconds, dump over a bunch of ice, add sweetener, and leave a cup brewing for seconds. :)3. Other drinks: Hot Chocolate/Cocoa tastes fine. Mild. But I'm a fan of homemade stuff with real milk and quality unsweetened cocoa. Also, I don't like additives in my cocoa. So, I won't buy this again. But it does taste like an adequate hot chocolate for folks into that. The Milky Way swirl is addictive. I'm repurchasing it as an occasional treat. I wouldn't recommend anyone on a diet or not wanting a bunch of iffy ingredients (corn syrup, hydrogenated stuff). But for an occasional dessert drink, it really has a lovely caramel latte sort of flavor. Nice. Sinful.4. Ease of operation is a plus.5. No clean up. NO CLEAN UP. NONE. NADA. I love this part beyond belief.6. Once you set it up, you just add water and change the filter every two or three months. That's it.I still can't get over the fact that I can think, "Hey, I'd love one cup of hot java," and in 30 seconds it's steaming in the cup. Dang. And every single cup is a fresh cup.For the ladies who have kitchen-impaired hubbies, another plus is that when you get the cold or flu and are in need of hot tea, even hubbies who can't boil water can have a cup ready for you in 30 seconds. Woo hooo! (Yes, my hubby has multiple college degrees, but ask him to boil up an egg or a cup of tea and you have to give directions.)So, if you love having a fresh cup anytime in a snap, don't mind not having top-range gourmet java, and want ease of operation and NO CLEAN UP as priority coffee maker properties, this is it.As others have stated, it is something of a drawback that the price per cup is high (convenience costs) and the coffee must be ordered. Fortunately, the myflavia site does get a shipment to you in about 4 to 5 days (mine came in four during the holidays), and if you order a couple cases at a time, you probably pay zip in shipping. (ie shipping free for 100 and over, it's about 5 bucks for 50 to 100, and it's 9 bucks for under 50).I strongly recommend finding a way to try/sample the beverages (find an office or a pal with a machine), so you get an idea. But, really, if you don't mind paying out about 50 cents per cup (or more, since if you want a strong cup and you change the setting, you get less fluid) for coffee and tea and cocoa, and the quality of coffee or tea in your supermarket suits you down to the ground, then this convenient machine may be for you.I know I love mine and have been known to do the Milky Way Latte dance in front of it. Hubby even teases me with, "Oh, and just how long does my sweetie need to wait for a fresh cup," with me sing-songing back, "Just a few seconds, baby!"Okay, it's Christmastime. WE get silly.One happy Flavia Fusion customer here. My wish: They add a sugar-free, non-hydrogenated product versions of the hot chocolate and the MIlky Way Swirl, and they get some additional medium strength type coffees. They seem to have a lot on the stronger side, but "3" ranking coffees, only the House Blend.Oh, and I wouldn't get the red or ice blue versions unless those are a real match to your kitchens. I've seen some unhappy customers who hated the cheap look of the blue, especially.MirEDITED January 25 to ADD: I've tried the espresso now and the exotic chai and raspberry spark. The espresso is okay. The raspberry spark is strong, so I like it iced. It's like the zinger teas. The exotic chai ROCKS. I'm ordering up a case of this. I've served it to company and they love it, too. I add milk or creamer and sweetener and it's a fab, comforting brew hot and a zippy snack iced.

I've been switching my house to a "green" and "organic" home. I've been through various types of paper products, and the recycled stuff tends to rate low. I tried two of the Green Forest products--bathroom tissue and napkins--and both are very, very good. The bathroom tissue is actually soft and "normal" (unlike Seventh Generation) and the napkins are like regular ones you get (not the premium, but everyday).You can use these recycled napkins with confidence.One hopes eventually the price on recycled paper products will be more affordable. But for now, I'm willing to pay a bit more to be earth-conscious, and Green Forest is getting it right (so far).Mir

I gave up gluten more than a year and a half ago. But I'm a girl who has always loved the pasta/cheese combo, and as a kid and adult, was one of those addicted to Kraft Mac n cheese, Amy's, any mac n cheese, really. :) I've been using gluten free Tinkyada pasta and just adding cheeses.I decided to try this, as it's dairy free. And it's fine. The pasta is fine. The spices packet is fine. And it makes a nice side dish. However, it's not mac-n-cheesy enough to satisfy that. Even having "Cheez" on the product name makes one expect cheeziness. Don't expect that and you'll be happier. :DWhat I will say is that the amount of oil they recommend ended up in a way too greasy outcome. I used coconut oil, and while the flavor was fine, I found it too oily, so cutting back is recommended for those who don't want greasy noodles.I'll also add that since this is mostly pasta and some spices, the price point is ridiculous, even with subscribe and save. Quite frankly, we'd be better off buying a good quality gluten free pasta and just mixing together the onion and paprika and other spices with oil and making our own. Yes, this makes it all-in-one convenient, but paying more than $4 bucks a bag for pasta and some spices kinda irks when it's not even organic.However, this is from a dedicated facility and definitely gluten free, and that's a plus.So, as long as you think of this as a spiced pasta side dish, you should be happy. If you want cheezy, then get some cheez item (like Daiya shreds) or cheese (the real stuff), and add it for cheezy/cheesy happiness. Or, really, just mix/make your own and save moolah.

I was browsing for titles under the search term "beast," because I'm a big fan of the B&B; archetype and stories based upon it. (Eg, Robin McKinley's and Charlotte Vale Allen's and Susan Kay's). This title sounded interesting, even though it's horror and not my B&B; type, so I went in search of excerpts. (I enjoy horror fiction, I should point out, so that subsequent comments aren't dismissed as mere prejudice against the genre.)It took a while to find an excerpt by googling. (Hint: Just find the website with the title plus dot org and you'll get there.)My Opinion: I can't buy or recommend this book based on the excerpt, a display of poor writing riddled with punctuation problems, syntactical weirdness, and some stunningly bad metaphors. It's pretty expensive, too. The cost has me guessing it's put out by a POD vanity publisher, which is a warning sign in and of itself. (I have yet to read a vanity published novel that isn't a stinker. I hold to the possibility there are good POD/vanity novels available. I just haven't happened upon one yet.)The prose itself leads me to believe no sharp editorial eye perused this before it went to press.As I said, judge for yourself: Read the excerpt at the website (full book title dot org).I will add that the remarks of some other reviewers comparing this work to that of Stephen King's is laughable hype. I would have skipped commenting if not for the over-the-top praise below. I want to make sure "beast" lovers and horror readers have a balancing voice and a chance to sample before buying. Caveat emptor.

The Body Shop's White Musk scent is a bestseller for good reason: it's a great everyday musk. Not cloying and not too sweet or too "unwashed". :)I love this buttery cream. I have dry skin and I need to apply a lot of lotion after bathing--from forehead to toes I use this on drier spots (not all over, as it can get expensive using large quantities). I put it on elbows/arms, feet, sometimes legs, upper bosom. I also use the Body Shop satin lotion to fill in other spots. (I use Lubriderm and Kinerase for neck and above, as I tend to get rashes on my face/neck from a lot of products.Creamy thick. Super-feminine musky scent. Excellent moisturizing properties.As long as you don't mind "dip your finger in" jars, you'll love this.

At the end of this film, I felt like something had been lacking in terms of characterization. A lot of the dialogue felt repetitive, and I think that space of talk (and there isn't that much of it) could have carried a bit more heft. And if flashbacks were to be used (and they were), they should have shed more light on the man walking north in the pitiless desert in the hopes of saving his life from the merciless hunter on his back.BUT...the opening is very nicely done. The supersaturated golds/yellows/brown that scream "DESERT". The low-key way the diner scene is done, and yet we feel menace in the air. It was nice to see Dee Wallace Stone again--a good actress who simply has not been adequately put to work in Hollywood, in my opinion.Even better, we get to spend some time with gravelly-voiced, sad-eyed Lance Henriksen, one of my fave character actors. He's the relentless hunter. Handsome, hawk-eyed Luke Goss (Nomak from BLADE 2 and Prince Nuada from Hellboy 2) is the hunted suit-wearing man who is kidnapped after he departs from the diner (where a lonely waitress played by Wallace Stone hits on him rather kindly, and he similarly kindly rejects). A nice guy, we think. A family man.But is he?And that's the question (or one of them) at the heart of this pursuit film. Who is good? Who is bad? Why is this happening? When one man puts another man to torture and testing, we assume he's either justified (by some previous act, as in PAYBACK) or unjustified (as in VANISHING POINT). Either it's a sociopath getting kicks from torturing a human being; or it's an angel of vengeance. Or maybe something grayer, but all the same, landing somehwere in that range of unmotivated/motivated and just/unjust.The notorious cactus scene is well-done. Luke Goss, whose past includes success as a cutiepie drummer for a band called Bros that was big in the '80s, shows that he can act without a ton of makeup on (as in the vampire mutant of Blade II or the tormented Elf Prince in Hellboy II). He has a lean, chiselled handsomeness that seems a shame to sunburn and torment. And he does a creditable job as the maybe good/maybe bad victim. I'd like to see him in other films. He's got an intersting face/voice, and I think he might do much better than some would expect of the recurring genre-film "monster."By the end, we know the why. So, there is closure, although you are left to guess one detail, and I won't spoil it.The direction is solid, if not consistently as stylish as the set-up and parts of the finale.I think fans of action films (or of one of the particular leads) can enjoy this. But it didn't rise as high as I would have liked, mostly because space was wasted (even with a fastish pace). I did enjoy the look of some of the desert scenes quite a bit.The bonus features were kind of pathetic, especially the "making of." Only a couple of places of the "how tos"--particularly the cactus scene how to--made it worthwhile. It didn't seem as if much thought went into that aspect. But worth watching for those who want a sense of "standing behind the scenes" reality.Mir

First off, don't expect a whole lot of logic in parts of this film. There is a phrase an "anglo" pal of mine and I--I'm Latina--have for this: Bollyworld. When you watch a Bollywood musical, you often have to suspend disbelief and accept that it might have much whimsy and disjointed editing and a certain odd logic. Just accept it and enjoy. It's something like suspending disbelief for a fantasy flick.Anyway, this is a schizophrenic movie. It starts off and you think it's gonna be quite comedic and light. But then it moves into heavy drama. It's a romantic triangle (as you'll know from the other reviews). Girl loves young, cute, hip, energetic fella who shares her gift for music. Boy loves beautiful, graceful, talented girl who sings like an angel. Ah, but this is not America. This is India, and the girl must marry the man her family chooses. And the guy her family chooses--who is captivated by the lovely, lively, singing, dancing vision he first views--is an honorable but staid guy who couldn't sing to save his life.So, now we're done with the light bits (and the sprightlier musical numbers), and we move into the quest. Here, you have the heroine's journey from girl to woman. And when she makes the decision at the end, it's a woman's decison--thought out, sober, deep, strong. It's not the fancy of a light heart, but the choice of a heart that's grown. It's a beautiful finale, really, trust me. Beautiful.I live in a neighborhood with several Indian "bazaars" and folks from that country. This was my second Bollywood flick. I discussed it with the proprietress of a local Indian goods shop, and told her how delighted I was that I could expect certain things in a Bollywood movie: respect for parents, sacrifice for family, the value of marital fidelity and that I didn't have to worry about a bunch of sweaty nekkid folks "hooking up". Here, a kiss MEANS a lot because that may be all you get (if that much). It's refreshing, that kind of modesty these days. Then I mentioned how I loved the ending. She said, "This is an Indian film. It HAD to end that way."I had to smile at that certainty.I recommend this movie if you're patient and enjoy 1. Beautiful clothes (does anyone make outfits as gorgeous as the people of India?) 2. Gorgeous Aishwarya Rai, probably the loveliest woman in current global cinema 3. Some really fun and "up" musical numbers 4. the depiction of true self-sacrificial love and 5. a romantically satisfying ending.Just be aware that Bollywood flicks do tend to suffer from lack of judicious editing. It's LONG. Hungary is a strange, strange place to pass off as Italy.Still, I recommend this. Lovely film. Enjoy!Mir

I've been using this for three weeks. It grinds gorgeously and you can choose how fine/coarse you want the grind. I put it at 16 for my drip coffee.It's easy to use if you don't have some hand issues (ie, arthritis). Anyone with hand/joints issues, this has no handle to pull out the container that holds the ground coffee. You have to grasp it by the edges and pull, which can be hard for some folks.The only reason I worry about the quality is that the little knob that you turn to choose how long it will grind has already fallen off once. No biggie. I put it back in. But a grinder THIS expensive should not have loose parts coming off after only 2 weeks of use. So, I'll be a bit anxious about how long it will work effectively and intact.Still, I'm happy with how it works so far, just not so happy that I'd give it a perfect score.MirUpdate: Stopped working--just plain stopped working--a couple years after purchase. I'm removing some stars for that. For the high price, I'd expect some longevity. For the past year and a half, I've been using a significantly cheaper--but nicely reviewed--burr grinder by Bodum. Does the job fine. Easier to move the setting (for those with joint issues). If it only lasts a couple years, I'll still be ahead, moneywise, than rebuying the Baratza one that's twice the price. :D

For all those who enjoyed Death Note the manga or the anime tv series, it's not crazy to expect you to enjoy these well-done (if not word-for-word exact) feature films in live action.All the principals look and sound great--the Shinigamis REM and RYUK, Light the "Killer", L the brilliant ferreter-outer of Kira, Misa the submissive love-slaves of Light. I was particularly fond of Ken'ichi as L. Replicating the huge, dark, round-eyed L of the anime would have been tough, even with a non-Asian actor, but Ken'ichi does a great job with posture, attitude, and L's idiosyncracies.This is a continuation of the first Death Note film, btw. The hunt continues with the delightful twists and turns (in mortal and spirit realms) that will lead to the discovery of Kira and the vindication of L's suspicions. The finale is terrific.This has been a truly quality story in various media--print, tv, film. I'd recommend them all, and certainly this flick.For those unfamiliar with the Death Note world: The death note is a book (one of many) that are properties of the death gods (shinigami). One book per death god. But the death gods may allow the book to enter the human world and be used by mortals. There are rules that govern how it can be used to kill (and as Light, smart as he is, discovers, to control actions and outcomes). Write a name, that person dies, essentially. The story ends up being a tense, twisty cat and mouse game between two brilliant young men--L the detective, Light the killer--each trying to overcome the other. Two death gods play their parts, as well as a young woman who is emotionally bound to Kira ("killer"). A special team of officers are put together to bring down Kira. It turns out to be not at all easy, and things get really complicated, especially since the saying about absolute power turns out to be very, very true.Thumbs up.

If money isn't your primary motivator, if you want to use a "green" product that is of good quality, then try this.I really hated the Seventh Generation toilet paper. Just totally fell apart and was uncomfortably rough to boot. This one is soft (not Charmin soft, but comfortably soft) and does the job without turning into mush (like 7th Gen).However, the remarks about the short roll-life are true. I find I go through one a day EASILY just by myself (ie, not counting hubby). Buying in bulk will be the way to go if you choose this.However, I compared it to my previous fave T.P.--Angel Soft--and it was comparable in how long the regular size roll lasted.If you're used to double rolls, it might be frustrating. If you use single rolls and are generous with how much, get ready to change rolls daily or twice a day (depending, right?)I like this product. As long as I can afford to, I'll buy green. But, realy, for folks on a tight, tight budget, consider how fast a 12 pack will last for you--could be less than a week for a couple, less than a few days for a family.But thumbs up for making recycled soft on my delicate bits.Mir

I totally was expecting a subpar adaptation of the excellent anime series (first manga) DEATH NOTE, which, for those unfamiliar with the storyline, involves the vigilante-justice use of a death god's notebook by a brilliant student, and his self-corruption while using it as he tries to evade justice in the hounding form of a sugar-addict Gothy detective genius.The anime was loads of fun, with cool music and excellent visuals. The manga was fun. And, hoorah, the film is terrific. I was not disappointed (except for the fact that there is an especially spoiled boy quality in the face/manner of the actor who plays Light Yagami, the death note wielder, that I found particularly annoying in spots, and effective in others.)The story is told across two DVDs (this is the first part of the total story, which deviates in places from the other tellings). This one shows how Light Yagami obtains the notebook from the death god (shinigami) Ryuk (or Ryuuk or Ryuku, as I've seen various spellings). Ryuk is a blast to look at in all the media, and works really well in the film while still retaining his weirdness (especially the face). REM is also effectively rendered, btw, in the second dvd/flick. The young actor who portrays L is delightful in his portrayal of the unusual mannerismss and broody but low-key playful demeanor of the brilliant (and somewhat ruthless) detective who hides his name from Light. Were I a teen, I'd have a massive-crazy crush on him and his ruminative, sweets-loving self. As a middle-aged woman, I allow myself a minor crush. :)The action moves at a good pace and the increasingly tense challenges that L and Light offer to each other are fun to watch--even knowing where the story goes. The two young actors work well against each other.Be sure to see the conclusion in the second flick. It's equally enjoyable and resolves beautifully (and differently from the anime). I ordered the third live-action film (not part of the original storyline) just to see L again, despite the less than wonderful reviews. You can probably skip the third, but do not miss this one and the follow-up, DEATH NOTE II: The Last Word. I do not think you will be disappointed, be you a fan of the characters/story or a total newbie to Death Note.Mir

This is the third Revolution tea flavor I've tried and enjoyed. If you are a fan of the ginger peach tea (Republic of Tea also makes a nice one), then you'll love this one. Black tea. Fruitiness. Spicy-ness. But not cloying or overdone. Strong enough to count, though. Needs no sweetening, but really, if you're into honey, that would be perfect for this tea. Whether hot or iced, this is one satisfying blend.I must say that I enjoy the beautiful infuser bags that Revolution puts out. It's not unique--I've had other teas in beautiful bags--but I must say, it enhances the experience, especially if you, like me, are fond of experiencing a good tea in a gorgeous china cup.Frangrance, flavor, and aesthetics. This has all three.Enjoy.

So, maybe I should judge these from a gluten free perspective and not just a cookie one. But well, that's tough. I like Pamela's pancakes (the only gluten free ones hubby really enjoys). So, I gave three of the cookies a shot.Mind you, they are NOT bad. The lemon flavor is terrific. Really tangy and strong. That made me happy. The crumbly texture, not so much. BUT..with a cuppa tea, when the urge for a cookie strikes--and given I can't bake to save my life, well, if I wanna cookie, someone else will have to make it for me--these will do nicely.I would recommend these for folks who want a "not full of lots of weird crap" gluten free cookie if they love a robust lemon flavor. This fits the bill.I also tried the swirl and chocolate chunk varieties. I'd pass on the swirl, personally. The chocolate chunk had a nicer flavor. Both of those were uber crumbly. If you're used to the texture of gluten-free cookies, fine. If not, beware. They are powdery, crumbly, fall apart easily. I've had them totally pulverize in delivery--just turn to utter crumbs.If I were to recommend a cookie to a gluten free eater who liked lemony flavor, so far, this would be the one. I'd consider buying again--not too soon--when cookie cravings hit. 3 to 3.5 stars, depending on my mood the day I nibble em. ; )

It's a funny thing. I had a tube of this at my house for months before I used it. I wasn't sure HOW to best use it, so I read suggestions over at CurlTalk and CurlMart on application. It said use a leave-in, and I hadn't found a leave-in I loved, so I kept putting off trying it.But then I switched hairdressers and that one used the Re:coil line. She used AG FAST FOOD leave-in condish and then THIS and I had TERRIFIC non-frizzy curls after part-diffusing by stylist and the rest drying in the car on the way home.I experimented on my own and got better results than even the stylist. I will say this does it's best work OVER a leave-in condish (I've used AG's, Curl Junkie, Abba Pure Gentle, and they all have worked fine). You can put it on very wet hair for bigger clumps, scrunching it in upside down.. You can rake it in or Denman brush it in then scrunch for smaller clumps and more volume. You can diffuse/Pixie-Curl diffuse for faster drying and tighter coils (Pixie-curling) or more volume (rougher diffusing).However you prefer to use it for results, it works well.It's a thick creme (nearly a paste) that I rub in my palms to distribute on hand, then rake and scrunch in (or just scrunch if I'm going for bigger clumps). It absorbs with scrunching and you'll see coils springing up nicer.In my experimentation, I found for late spring moist warmth and deep summer hellish humidity, using the Leave-in/RE:coil/ medium-to-firm hold gel is the perfect trifecta for frizz-free and coily curls that withstand some wind (I tested it once at the beach). Medium gel worked perfectly in spring. It works well in summer, too, with a very light addition of firmer gel on top (canopy ). Or just use firm hold gel on top, whichever is your fave. I can get nice second day hair with this triple play, and sometimes right into third day hair. The curls persist. All I need to do is add a bit more leave-in and Re:coil on subsequent days to refresh.You can see my Re:coil use recently in my Fotki account under MirCurls (my Curltalk moniker), where I took pics after it dried on July 18. One of my best curly hair days ever. You can also check April 23 and some days in May and June for other Re:coil uses with other products. But the Leave-in/Re:coil/Gel is the best so far. ETA: The pics for July 31 of 2010 use are up, too, and in deep Miami (sooo hot, soo humid, high dew points) summer, this combo worked perfectly to control frizz, maintain curl and volume. Big subtropical thumbs up.Don't overdo at first. Put a blob the size of a nickel (I have BSL hair) and rub in palms adnd then distribute. If you find that was too much/too little for you, adjust. My hair is fine and I don't take TOO much product. It smells like, hmm, vanilla-ey marshmallows. Sweetish. And doesn't overly linger on me.I liked Re:coil so much, I've bought the whole line, and it works very well, synergistically, this summer for me. Excellent stuff and deserving of being one of the BEST OF THE BEST for 2010 over at NaturallyCurly site.AG Re:coil is CG (ie, water soluble, so fine for cowashers). The rest of the line has some items with 'cones. So if you cowash, this is fine, but some of the rest you should tread with caution. I lowpoo and nopoo, alternately, so not an issue. If you lowpoo, you can use the AG FAST FOOD with the RE:coil, no problem.Happy curls to you!

I bought my box of this tea on the ground, not Amazon. I know sometimes the sub and save products can be near expiration or be stale. I've had that issue sometimes. So, cannot speak to the sub/save version's quality.The tea itself is lovely. The white tea tastes like a lighter version of green tea, and the pear taste is super subtle. But the aroma--wow, that's just such a pleasure. Sniffing is a big part of the pleasure of this gentle tea. This is great for folks who want the pleasurable experience of teabags--they are beautiful, pyramidal mesh bags, no string, but feel "high class"--rather than using loose leaves.If you hate strong tasting or overly complex tea flavor combos, this is a great one to try. Easy in the mouth, wonderful in the nose, and with the antioxidants we all want from green/white tea.Enjoy...

If I had to judge this just on, say, the script or some other high-brow category, this would be a 1/2 star flick.But you don't watch this kind of action flick for the dialogue and the deep philosophical musings. You watch CRANK for--1. Jason Statham, in or out of a car, mostly in, mostly fighting, mostly scowling and being ridiculously testosterony.2. To see what loony thing they can do with a car, a crash, a gun, a knife, or whatever other lethal implement is at hand3. To watch bad guys get it4. To hear kicking music while human beings run around like mad for who knows what purpose most of the timeIn those terms, CRANK does its job. It's high energy. It's got funny bits--the ending is actually a morbid hoot. The camera makes you dizzy now and then. It's got loud, driving music. It's got fights. It's got a very strange bit with a car and an escalator. (I assumed the escalator bit was coming. I had not guessed the details of the how.)Jason Statham does action well. He's got the physique and the angular bone structure and the "I'm trouble" look in the eyes down pat. He's quite a hunk in a rough and laconic way. So, okay, if you dig Jason, you're more than half-way to enjoying CRANK.Ultimately, though, it's dumb and absurb and, when it comes to how women fare in the film, really insulting. There's not even a competently villainous, brainy woman in there. No, apparently, the double X-ers are only good for sitting around topless or wanting to be banged in public. I dunno. Maybe the director/writers spend a lot of time watching hip-hop videos, cause that's the way females come across in this film--decorative and underdressed and mostly with nothing to say. Bimbos without a plan.While you're watching this, you may be both jazzed at the fast pace and annoyed (I was) at the portrayal of women. When it's done, it really came down to just a bit of forgettable adrenaline on film (okay, a lot of adrenaline on film), that wouldn't have worked AT ALL without the presence of Statham and that guy who playeed Verona (who reminded me of Cuba Gooding in a way).If you don't expect much other than action, noise, and Statham's he-man with a glint in his eye and his hands on the wheel or on the gun performance, and if you can overlook its treatment of women as mere T&A;, you can have some fun with it. Otherwise, skip CRANK.Mir

I've got this color on my toes right now. It's one of my fave classic OPI colors in the cool spectrum. It's a sort of lighter, brighter version of Bogota Blackberry. And this formula LASTS. I've had it on my toes for 2 weeks, and only now do I need to redo it (though it still looks okay, just a tad "tired" on the top edges, if ya know what I mean?)Hard to describe the color for me (I'm not expert on color names) but this is a vivid cool-toned but deep pinky-red-wine. Not very dark. Not light. More medium-dark with a lot of gleam to it, a shimmery color. An attractive color for a lot of skin tones, I'm guessing. I'm a med-dark olive skinned Latina (NC44 via MAC shades), and it suits me very well.Love the gleam. Love the long wear. Love the girliness of it. This baby hangs around the OPI stock for a reason. It's a great color.Mir

I have been a loyal user of Inner Grace for more than a year--and that remains my fave Philosophy shower gel. However, I got a yen to try one of the others. I almost got the Amazing Grace, but at the last minute, changed to this one. Why? There's something about this scent that takes me back. There is this "baby cologne" smell that is reminiscent of the way children smelled in my Cuban childhood. Not the violet baby cologne, but a more perfumey, less floral one--crisper, more unisex and "soapy". That nostalgia is worth paying extra for.I like the creamy formula, even though it does have a strong surfactant--SLS--which will irritate some. I have supersensitive skin and, sometimes, I have to go strictly with Cetaphil or Aveeno or Aquaphor or other unscented products. But when I can handle scents, I like Philosophy's line, as it doesn't irk me like some skinwise. Between the more sensual Inner Grace and this crisper Pure Grace, I have shower gel/cream to cover a couple of my moods.For a cream, this lathered exceedinly nicely on my washcloth. I felt very clean--well, duh, it has a strong cleanser--but also moisturized somewhat, which is nice.Not everyone is gonna love this scent. Some might find it on the sharp side, on the Zesty soapy side, but it fades quickly, like all other Philosophy bath scents. Layering only helps slightly. Dunno why, but Philosophy scents just don't have "hold." But that's okay. Smells so nice while you're showering.One star off for the 1. strong cleanser when they've made a cream formula to be "gentler" and 2. the quick dissipation of scent.But I would rebuy just the same. Nostalgia is a potent thing.Enjoy,

I used to have miso soup all the time, until I developed a seafood allergy (of serious dimensions, as in trips to the ER). Since being diagnosed (twice, yeah, two trips to the ER for separate dining out incidents), I was told strictly to avoid fish/shellfish. So, no more restaurant miso soup for me, as it generally made with fish stock.This is how I get my miso soup fix. The broth is lovely (if not exactly the flavor of authentic restaurant Japanese miso soup), that mild, gentle flavor, the strips of seaweed also mild. This soup has tiny bits of soy protein (nice addition) and has some mushroom (which is why the broth is so nice, I think) and, of course, green onions.However, one star off for the noodles. I found the serving of noodles generous in ratio to broth, but I didn't find the texture or flavor satisfying. Usual store-bought ramen, I guess, has a lot more fat than this very low-fat soup, and fat affects texture/flavor. So, if you're used to the cheap supermarket ramen--which, I'll admit, I do like-- this will not be the same.But I'd buy it again for the broth, and leave out the noodles or break the serving down to a smaller portion.For those of you used to vegan/low-fat ramen, this should not be a problem. I just am spoiled with fattier ramen soups.Lots of plusses, though--organic noodles, simple ingredients, lowfat, easy to fix (I pour in boiling water and in a couple of minutes, done), microwaveable (for the brown-bagging contingent).Another useful product from Dr. McD that won't break your caloric bank at 180 cals per container and which offers only 1 gram of fat. Other nutritional facts per container: 680 grams of sodium, 2 grams of fiber, 36 grams of carbs, 8 grams of protein.I hope Dr. McD makes a vegan miso without noodles in the future, simply adding more tofu, green onions, and dehydrated mushrooms to punch it up. I'd prolly give that one 5 stars. :)

I liked Dr. McDougall's split pea soup and his oatmeal, so I decided to try this.Oh man. I could not believe how disappointing this was. The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles. If you love rice noodles, the Asian style, this has oodles.But the flavor was lacking. So bland, it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water. It's called Pad Thai soup, but as a pad thai afficionado, I can't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai--other than Asian noodles.If you like watery noodle soup, go for it.If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess, this is not a soup I can recommend.Mir

This is a pricey product, but my husband, whose had issues with rosacea on his face for three decades, tried a sample of this last month and found it helped. So, we ordered up the full size, and I do notice his face is noticeably less ruddy and blotchy. He uses it in conjunction with a moisturizer.So, if you have rosacea, this is a product worth trying.

We're a gluten-free household and when I last went to Whole Foods, I bought this to try. It was a small size, had a reasonably modest caloric count, and I thought this could be a nice spaghetti snack-style treat when I was feeling lazy. I liked the ingredients list didn't have a ton of sugar and weird preservatives, although it does have modified starch and xanthum gum.But it comes down to this: it tastes not good. Pretty icky. The sauce is weirdly sweet and the noodles are short (like spaghetti that's cut into small pieces, like for a child) and unappealing. The texture of the noodles is rather hideous: kinda grainy, like rice that wasn't fully cooked. It's like a mutant version of Franco American canned spaghetti (remember that brand?)--soupy and sweet, but this is the "yucky" mutant version. I totally don't understand the high-star reviews.Honestly, I am willing to give up some on taste/texture for convenience, cause some days, you don't feel well or are in a rush, but this is not worth the trade-off. I'll take the time and make gluten-free pasta and eat leftovers before I eat this again. There are delicious gluten free pastas on the market and you can put any diet-friendly homemade or jarred sauce you like. I have no idea how Orgran could ruin such a simple food.Really disappointed. I so wanted this to be nice.

The reviewer below says she was offended as a devout Catholic. I'm a devout believer in Christ, as well, and understand why the sex scenes and the degradation the character endures are offputting. Stop to consider, though, that the story, whether the director intended it or not (and it's so obvious, he must have intended it), puts the main character in there as a Christ figure. She lets herself be abused and killed for the sake of love and to "save" another, her husband. Sound familiar?Bess's character reminds me of the Scriptural teachings on how believers must come to God as little children--trusting, open--and that what's in our heart matters to God. He sees the heart, not just the outward pieties. Bess is a guiless woman and a gentle dimwit. She's "stupid", she says and others accept. But in her foolishness, she nevertheless has ongoing dialogues with the Creator, who let her be born thusly. When she does evil things (the promiscuous sex), she does them out of a childlike impulse of faith and a good motive (healing). (The opposite of the Pharisees, btw, who were told off by Christ for doing their good acts out of selfish and prideful motives and with hard hearts, trusting in their own holy actions, rather than standing humbly before a gracious and merciful God who sanctifies those who trust wholly in Him.)There is a moving and well-done scene during an inquest. They're trying to decide on Bess' state of mind to understand her actions. What the doctor originally wrote about her had to do with "psychotic" and "neurotic" and a compulsion to perverse sexual acts. The doctor says he would rewrite his opinion, and he would say about her that she was... "good." This stuns the judges. "Good?" And it's an awkward moment for everyone there, even the doctor who is struggling to understand exactly the nature of Bess and her actions. It's a fascinating moment of insight. Earlier in the film, Bess herself mentions Mary Magdalene, who though a prostitute by traditional accounts, went on to become, as Bess says, "beloved" of God.SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!It's no surprise, then, that as Christ had to die, brutally, abused at the hands of those who couldn't perceive his goodness and mission, Bess, the suffering-servant-savior type here, dies as well, misunderstood by the community, labeled a "sinner" and damned by the elders of her very strict Scottish sect. Interestingly, her grave is empty.(Hear the gospel echoes?)Her husband, with the aid of his colleagues, steals her body to bury it at sea.Bess's death has not been useless. It has powerful effects: illumination in the doctor who loved her and the friend who tried to guide her, and divine healing to her dying husband. We, the viewer, are shown in no uncertain terms, that heaven is pleased with Bess's faith, love and sacrifice (if not her methodology). The bells of heaven ring miraculously over the oil rig where Bess's widower stands listening. We know her soul is in Paradise.Try not to get weepy at the finale. I know I can't help it.

I'm middle-aged, but I enjoyed volume one of RUNAWAYS. It's not as if there's anything grandly new here. If you've read comics at any point in the last 30+ years, you'll get the "been here, read this" feeling. What's nice is that the young people do have contemporaryish patter. You get your multicultural stuff, your hippieish-vegan entries, your "young people must save the world..again" groove that seems to satisfy the need of young readers to feel heroic and superior to their parents. The Generation Gap is alive and well in RUNAWAYS.Still, it's got a nice pace, action, dark deeds, heroic deeds, and the bickering you'd expect among teens. Plus a pre-teen who adds the added dimension.In this opening bound volume, we get to meet the families of Villains/Heroes--that is, the parents are villains and the kids will be heroes who decide to break from the familial units and band together to stop the evil plans of their moms and dads. That, in itself, is a huge conflict. Think about it: Would you be willing to fight your parents to the death? Hmmm. I don't know. Sounds tough to me. And that's good. Anything that adds an emotional and conflictive dimension to a story is a dramatic plus.So, kids find out who parents really are, learn things about themselves they never knew (ie, each one has a power/gift/specialty), and, yes, they become RUNAWAYS. Of course, running away from supervillains isn't easy. They have ways of making you show yourself, ways of tracking you, ways of making running away extremely stressful. And that's good, too.I like the digest size volume. I am vexed that amazon doesn't have the digest size volume two: Teenage Wasteland. Geesh. Now I have to traipse to the local comic store and scout for it. Or order it. Why is volume 2 so hard to find?Well, be warned. While volume one is a pleasant graphic novel read, you may have a bit of a headache getting to the next installment in this form.Mir

This is, what, 99.9% water with a drop of fruit extract? The price is overblown. Hence the star off.However, for those who like something a little extra with their water, this is very nice stuff. The pear flavor seems a bit more than pear--I want to say there's a hint of banana and a hint of honeydew under there, too. It's nice. I like it. Someone described it as adding water to a glass in which you've had juice. Yep, that's it, with a more complex character, perhaps, to the flavor.Bottled water, flavored or not, is big business and I understand why they'd price it as high as they can get away with it. It's an aptly named, pleasing product, so yeah, four stars.But I'm thinking of investing in a half-dozen fruit essences/extracts and some TrueLime, TrueOrange, and TrueLemon, and just add it to my chilled filtered water at home. It irks to pay this much for "hinty" water. Plus all these plastic bottles are not helping the planet any, are they? I've got stainless steel and other eco-friendly goods at home, might was well put them to use.

This is a pricey item--cost me $40 in a beauty supplier's in Miami, is less here. But it blows the $20 Tweezerman outta the water. The point is thinner, so it's a breeze to get ingrown facial hairs out. It catches hold of the teeniest, tiniest, finest, nearly invisible hairs (the ones you can only see in a 12x or 14x mirror).I love it. This and my Tweezerman spa point are the only two tweezers that give me pain-free, quick, easy plucking ability.Costly, but it's worth it. It can be sterilized without rusting. Also, it has a lifetime guarantee for its precision Swiss hand craftmanship.Plus, the goldtone is so elegant.Mir(this review is for the MeHaz by Rubis Cosmetic Point Tweezer #132, 3 3/4 length)UPDATE JULY 2009: I don't know if I got a bad batch or RUBIS is losing its quality edge, but I bought these from amazon this month and the quality is definitely down. The tweezers I got were rough, really rough, snagging on the skin, and they didn't have the same markings as my other Rubis (dunno if they changed that or I got a knock-off cause the logo is not the same), and they didn't pluck as well due to snagging on my skin. So, have no idea what's going on, but I was not totally pleased with these gold-points, particularly given the price. Maybe it was just that the same tweezer with Rubis Mehaz was better-made...could be? But these were disappointing.ADDENDA: Spoke to the LMC/Rubis distributor representative in CA (nice lady), and checked out the official websites. The logo is different. The logo change is not to worry, was told. This is definitely a RUBIS from the ONE Rubis factory in Switzerland I got, not a faux. So, I'm gonna keep using it, maybe have it filed down a bit to smooth the roughness I'm perceiving. Size and shape-wise, same as my old gold point RUBIS, so just a bit of variation in the batch? In any case, this is a fast and reputable seller, so if you want to try it, go ahead, no worries.

Sharp. Comfy handles. Attractive. Durable. VERY thin blades. Nicely made.Since I discovered these some six or so years ago, I have a collection of unused cuticle scissors by other makers. Rubis blows them outta the water. Stay sharp for a long time before needed sharpening.My husband helps me with my pedicure, and these are the ONLY scissors he likes using on my feet. I use them to cut my fingernails,too, they're strong enough (though very thin and meant for cuticles).LMC is an authorized distributor of RUBIS, so it's safe to get from them.thumbs up

I love this show and hope it comes back for a second season. The premise will be familiar to readers of paranormal romances--a woman dies unexpectedly and comes back in another form that gives her a new perspective on life, society, romance, and, ultimately, her own self.In this case, the diva that drops dead is a shallow, self-absorbed, not all that bright, but not mean, hot blond with a hot lawyer fiance. Refusing to accept death, she defiantly presses a "return" button while being processed in the afterlife, and whammo, she's back on earth, resuscitated in the body of a very smart, but very chubby brunette lawyer ( looks reminiscent of Delta Burke, but less kittenish).And off we go. Deb, the dead diva, has to adapt to a new reality as Lane-Bryant-clad plus-size plain Jane. She has her own personality with Jane's brain--so she has a boatload of legal know-how. And, oh oh, her fiance is now a lawyer at Jane's firm. Another female lawyer--one with a slim physique and icy demeanor and high-level ambition that contrasts with Janes's plumpness and subdued prettiness and bit of Deb-ditziness. They sometimes clash, sometimes cooperate, and they are each refining the other, which is cool to watch. Everyone is fated to learn and grow.The humor and drama are well-balanced, and it's fun to see Margaret Cho as the deadpanning snarky but capable assistant to Jane. The actor who plays Deb's fiance is very appealing and quite handsome (reminds me of the late Edward Albert when he was young with a dash of that guy who was Quentin in DARK SHADOWS, for those who remember). He effectively conveys his loss of Deb as heartrending, and his moments with Jane (where they build a friendship) are so touching and lovely, that I long for the next one where they sit together intimately.There are shades of LEGALLY BLONDE (with Deb/Jane as a sort of Elle, but with the blonde super-fashionista on the inside). Others refer to Ally McBeal, but this show seems to have a kinder heart and less cynicism than that one.The guest stars in this first season have been a hoot, including Rosie O'Donnell as a judge, Liza Minelli with Delta Burke as feuding sisters, and Paula Abdul.It may not be a ground-breaking or uberbrilliant show, but I always look forward to it and my hubby likes to watch with me, too. It's fun, it's got romance, and the actress who plays Jane/Deb is very appealing and likable, with an expressive voice and a wonderful ability to switch deftly from ditzy Deb to on-the-job Jane---and you root for her to win her cases and, we hope, get her man...back!Thumbs up.

Harder to find than my usual OPI base coat, I nevertheless tried it on the recommendation of users at a beauty site. And I'm glad. This is a fabulous product. Goes on smooth. Dries fast. And it really latches on to color while protecting the nail itself. I find there is MUCH less staining of my nails (I love dark red polish and deep burgundy tones which stain like mad usually). It also keeps my color adhering longer and smoother. Very nice.If you're not happy with your base coat, really consider trying Mavala. I love their ridge filler and nail polishes, too ("Sangria" is just too gorgeous.)The bottle is smaller than OPI--which you should know so you aren't shocked by the size--but this is quality stuff and worth the effort of getting it.

How 3 simple ingredients--sugar, egg whites, and apricot kernels--can make such an amazingly delicious cookie treat, I can't fathom. Apricot kernels? How weird is that?But that they are. My sister and I gobble these things up like insane women. Yes, these nibbles of sweet and amarettoey deliciousness get ahold of your taste buds and refuse to let go. Perfect with espresso--or any coffee-and delightful with tea and cocoa, you do your sense of pleasure a favor by getting these for your nightly sweet treat. (If you allow yourself one.)I've tried four other types of amaretti, and found the others either too hard or too chewy or just not flavorful enough. These have the consistency I like and the strong burst of "amarettiness" that I desire.But be careful. You will find it hard to stop at one serving. You will find it hard to stop, period. We do. Sigh.Oh, the joy of Lazzaroni amaretti. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.Mir

This is a really, really good instant oatmeal. I have a soft spot for apple cinnamon instant oatmeals and have, in the past, eaten Quaker's and McCann's versions. This one is by far the best. The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3-5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice "gloopy" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir--it will be "pebbly" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and "clean", and I tend to sweeten it just a bit more. I also tend to use two packets, but then, I used to use two packets of Quaker, etc, as well.Another good product from Dr. M. Hurrah!

We all know no packaged soup--canned or cuppa--is gonna be as delicious as the fresh, home-made stuff. Still, convenience is worth a bit of sacrifice, for those rushed or lazy days. I ordered this because 1. I like split pea, it's like a filling, comfort soup and 2 I wanted to try a vegan soup (no ham or the other stuff that they usually put in pea soup).I didn't expect much. I expected ADEQUATE, no more.Well, surprise me. This was TASTY. I am very pleased with this dried/cup soup. If you follow instructions precisely, it should come out with a terrific texture (not too runny, not too thick) and a nice pea flavor. My only quibble is that it's on the salty side (though not eye-crossingly so).I would definitely get more of this. I'm gonna go through this case pretty fast, I can tell you.I'm ready to try more of McDougall's vegan soups. If others are as good or better than the Vegan Split Pea with Barley, then I'm in for some nice convenience lunches.Each container has 240 calories (that's considered two servings, but please, who eats just half?), 10 grams of fiber, 16 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat (no trans fats), and 42 carbs. The sodium count is 600mg. 24% of Vitamin A requirement.Yum.Mir

I adore this shower gel. I ADORE IT!I have super-sensitive skin, so I tend to have to use fragrance-free products for my skin--Aveeno, Aquaphor, Cetaphil. This, however, is one fragranced gel I can use and NOT itch or get a rash.On top of that it cleans so well without stripping the skin unduly. It leaves you feeling miraculously fresh and the scent is this perfect green-herbally smell (reminiscent of the original green scent of Herbal Essence shampoo back in the seventies, which was my fave shampoo scent).I also like that the pump is a good one. Even on the big bottle, it doesn't clog up or malfunction. At least, I've never had one go bad on me, unlike some other pump bottles for hygiene/shower products.Because it's a tad pricey (but worth it for the quality), I use this not everyday, but on my workout days--that is, right before going to Pilates, I shower with this, because it totally keeps me smelling nice without perfumes (verboten at the studio) and I don't get stinky, even after an hour of sweating it up.A gorgeous product. And at this sale price, I'm psyched! :)(They also make a "sugar scrub" in this scent that is wonderful for a very light, non-irritating scrub of the feet and elbows.)Mir

I have avoided a dentist for whitening because I don't want to overly sensitive my already sensitive teeth. But I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and I notice it has an effect on my teeth (which are not white to start with, so don't need to be made worse, ya know?)This has worked for me. I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth most of the time, but about 3 to 5 times a week, I use this system to remove some of the accumulated stains from food/beverages. I notice a difference. It's not a dazzling difference, mind you--you're not gonna look like some movie star. But it's enough that I NOTICE.I've been using it for several months (prior to that I used the Supersmile for four years by itself). It really works better with the bleaching gel. However, I suggest you use slightly less of the bleaching gel (the clear one) or you'll run out too fast. The directions say use equal measures of both, but somehow, I always run out of the bleach before I run out of the toothpaste, even when it looks like I'm using equal measure.I always keep a spare of this system in my bathroom cabinet. I wouldn't do that unless this had some good effect. :)

I'm nearly fifty, and I can tell you that if you are female and have some "young-at-heartness" about you, you can LOVE this anime series.This looks to qualify as a reverse harem situation (one main female protagonist with two to several possible suitor/protective male characters). As in other reverse harem tales, the female is a catalyst for the emotional growth of the males, a feminine nucleus of insight that changes the world of those around her. In this one, Tohru is just such a character--a generous, guileless, industrious, uncomplaining, highly optimistic orphan who refuses to let her woes become a burden to anyone if she can help it. Her memories of her mother make her want to be the best she can be. Bit by bit, she learns to rely on others, which is hard for her, even as she shows others about their own "remarkable" qualities and uniqueness. She is so compassionate, that her own ability to show caring and mercy will, we assume, one day lift this terrible curse.There are many "ooh aww" moments, when we feel our hearts touched by the sorrows and vulnerabilities of these characters, and I was entranced. I reverted emotionally to the fragile, but vibrant times of being young and insecure and afraid, but also eager to learn and grow. It's a lovely series.So, what is it about. Other reviewers have covered it well: A pretty teen gal who is temporarily living on a tent in the woods due to her family home being renovated and her being unwilling to burden her two best friends with her presence for weeks, well, she comes into contact with a remarkable set of males living in a constantly-being-wrecked (and comically so) home. The males are part of a clan that includes a curse related to the Asian zodiac (you know, rat, horse, dog, etc). When embraced by a female, the males who are cursed transform into their animal forms. Poof! She is invited to stay with them to live, as her tent collapses due to the ground being weak and rain-sodden.In this home live the rat (silver-haired Yuki, an adored-from-afar prince archetype, super-pretty and able to charm whomever he chooses with his looks), the dark-haired dog (Shigure, an adult male novelist who likes to wisecrack and be melodramatic, but who also tends to be in the middle of the shenanigans between rat and cat), and red-headed Kyo the Cat, an animal tricked in folklore into being left out of the zodiac due to the rat's ancient trickery.The animosity between rat and cat is ongoing and a main part of the narrative drive. Tohru, who cares for them both, wants to see them develop something more than constant fighting/arguing/enmity.As expected, there is pressure from a "villainous" character in the form of clan leader/God Akito and comedy in the gender-bending tradition (a seemingly bisexual brother, as well as other yaoi situations; a cross-dressing relative, a cute-boy archetype, a somber dark-haired male of secret power, etc). There are plenty of school scenes, where the cursed boys and Tohru and her misfit pals (the former gang-girl, the "electric" psychic goth gal) have to try to get along with those who adore them or hold them in contempt. (Prince Yuki even has a fan club.)The storylines that show us the background of haunted Hatori the melancholy doctor and the dread secret of Kyo the Cat were heartbreaking and made me cry, but also uplifting in the healing that Tohru could bring to such woeful characters. On the lighter side, the episode with the visit of the cute rabbit-Momiji loli-boy that includes Yuki in a girly dress was quite funny. As was the one where Tohru's friends visit and transformational mayhem ensues as they keep accidentally embracing the boys.Tohru, the impossibly sweet and adorable girl who can heal with her goodness, is much better voiced in the Japanese, as is Ayame, Yuki's flamboyantly narcissistic brother. In the English, Ayame sounds like a mocking version of a gay man. It's not the pleasantest voice acting bit. Momiji is also much cuter in the Japanese. I did like the voices of Kyo and Yuki in the English and Shigure is less over-the-top in English, too, which I prefer.This is a series that makes you want to be a better person to others, more accepting, and that's a good lesson for the young. It also makes you want to hold your head up despite woes and tribulations. To work hard and be stoic, but not excessively so that your friends aren't allowed to aid you. It has good lessons, excellent animation, delightful humor, romance, mystery, touching scenes, nice music, and magic.The manga continued way past the point of this series, and I've read there will not be more anime (ie, to show the rest of the story.) If you want to know how it ends (ie, is the curse lifted, and who will get Tohru), the manga is available to read free online. Just google it up.A big thumbs up for the anime of Fruits Basket.

I've had some unfortunate and disappointing experiences with all sorts of canned soups, but for some reason, especially minestrone. But I love the combo of tomatoey broth, beans, veggies, and pasta, so I always kept searching.This is probably the best I've had. Now, that's a mitigated "best". Canned soup can never approach the wonderfulness of the freshly made stuff. However, I'm a lazy cook, and I often rely on canned versions, especially when cold/flu strikes.This lighter in sodium version is really good. It's density is perfect--not overly brothy, not overly thick--and the saltiness is just right. The beans are yummy, though I agree with another reviewer that a bit more pasta would be welcome.I am not vegan, so I do tend to add a sprinkle of shaved or shredded parmesan on top, which hides the imperfections magnificently. By imperfections I mean the "tinny" quality that canned products tend to acquire and the bit of herbal imbalance I sensed. The parmesan took care of that, added that cheesy loveliness, and made this canned soup a satisfying lunch. I didn't even need crackers or toast. This was just fine.So, if you, like me, depend on canned soups and prefer organic to non-organic, this is a very dependable choice.I would, however, think twice ordering from amazon. I buy a LOT from amazon--thousands a year--but my experience with canned goods is spotty. And with Amy's bad. The cans can be pretty messed up. And I won't eat soup out of a badly dented can. I was raised with the admonition that this damages the intergrity of the product and you risk food spoilage.Mir

I bought this cause I wanted a cheap watch I can wear for exercise walking. I had bought a handful of those big-face jelly watches in assorted colors to go with my sports tops. but those watches are kinda heavy, though easy to read.I decided to try and find a lighter watch for the same purpose and found this one on Amazon--cheap, simple color (can wear with any of my exercise clothes--and it looked like my middle aged eyes could see the time without glasses (as I don't wanna haul readers along with me on my 30 minute walks). This has a second hand that's really fine/thin, so very hard to see with presbyopia. BUT..I can barely make it out. So, to take one's pulse, this works, too, to make sure one is in the aerobic zone.For me, it's about being useful, readable, and cheap. Utilitarian. Lightweight. Lies nicely flat against the wrist. Not clunky ugly like those rhinestone encrusted jelly watches that cost a bit more.Will update if quality is total pits. :)Enjoy...

What you will notice here is a mea culpa that is vague, but a lot of accusations against people who were not &quot;out to get him&quot;, but out to get the truth. The truth was built up, day by day, step by step, fact by fact, and can be found in SELLING SATAN (highly recommended).Biblically, when we are caught in sin, it is the church's job to call us on it, call us to repentance, and &quot;out us&quot; if we won't clean our act up ourselves. Warnke says he didn't seek to gain wealth from ministry, and yet he states he focused &quot;on the bottom line&quot;...well, what is that if not focusing on the perks-=-money and expense accounts, etc. He is vague about his failings--but SELLING SATAN will let you in on what those failings were so you will not be sold again by this seller.Are there wounded in the church? yes. Can the church be too harsh? yes. Does God's love remain steady? Yes. In these areas, Warnke is right. BUT...as someone whose wounds were self-inflicted (by his unrighteous and disordered personal life and false witness), he cannot point the finger at his accusers, who merely brought light into a dark ministry.I hope Mr. Warnke has renewed his spiritual and emotional life. I hope he does much good work for the Lord, in humility and the strength of the spirit, but I wouldn't recommend that any believer buy this book and support the ministry of someone who continues to deny the incontrovertible proof set forth by those in the body who could no longer tolerate his lies.Pray for Mike, but don't support his pity party.

I cannot tell you how many tears I've shed listening to these songs and how many prayers I've sent up in response to these lyrics. I can tell you that if you love the Lord, this album should be part of your collection--if you can find it. I still have my original LP, the music book, and the songs in various Keith collections.There isn't a dud on here, but the ones that shine the most for me include his rendition of the 23rd psalm (still my fav of all versions of this most beloved of psalms). A friend of mine from my previous church, the pianist/music teacher, used to play this when we got together for fellowship, her on piano and me singing, and it's still just the most beautiful adaptation in popular music of "The Lord Is My Shepherd." Keith's vocals are full of emotion and true spiritual fervor and faith. Astonishing.Another favorite is "How Majestic Is Your Name" (Psalm 8), a song I occasionally sing a capella when moved by the night sky or a sunset or some other wonder of nature. "When I consider the heavens, the work of they fingers..." Keith's sense of wonder at God shines through this semi-meditative but passionate song.On the darker, heavier side, you get a "spiritual" called "Oh God, our Lord" which is great to sing, but not an easy subject to digest with lyrics such as:"Who you gonna throw in the lake of fire, O God our Lord?Who you gonna throw when the flames get higher, O God our Lord?The Devil and the man with the dark desire, O God our Lord."Keith really gets into it, his voice low and heavy at times, high and full of pain at others.Another deep, difficult song describes those times when we feel in need of assistance and we can only cry to God out of our frustration and helplessness:"My flesh is tired of seeking God,But on my knees I'll stay.I want to be a pleasing child,Until that final day.My mind is full of many thoughtsThat clutter and confuse.But standing firm, I will prevail,In faith that I'll be used.Amen! I'm asking once again.Won't you help me my friend, Lord Jesus."Keith's voice is beautiful in those lines of pleading.."won't you help me, my friend, Lord Jesus.""There Is A Redeemer" is a simple melody, simple earnest lyrics, and is so "singable" that it has earned a place in hymnals and worship services across the land. "There is a Redeemer, Jesus, God's own son. Blessed Lamb of God...Messiah! Holy One. Thank you, oh, my Father, for giving us your Son and leaving Your Spirit till your work on Earth is done." It's a basic expression of gratitude and worship and it holds up."Jesus is Lord of All" and "You Are The One" and "The Promise Song" are peppy and bouncy and full of joy and affirmation of truth. From the last of those we get this:"Oh if you keep My word,I'll make you as a tree,Planted by the streams of life,If you'll submit to me.And if you love the hateful ones,Who mistreat you constantly,The book of life shall bear your name,If you love your enemies.""Glory Lord Jesus" is effervescent and energetic and will have you with your hands up in the air.Like his version of Psalm 23, Keith's version of "Holy, Holy, Holy" is part of the reason why that is among my most favorite of all classic hymns. I never tire of it.Those are most of the songs, and I think you will find pleasure and an encouragement to worship here. These are truly "Songs for the Shepherd" that all the sheep can treasure. Keith's earnest and passionate vocals, his skill on the piano, and the evident faith that colors all his songs shine decades after he got called home.Mir of Mirathon blog

I drink a goodly amount of green tea, so I prefer to get decaf. Ive tried several brands, cheap to higher end, and this one falls in the middlish. I use it almost daily and it's fine for a basic decaf. I like it iced with a twist of lime.Enjoy...

You can actually find cheaper prices for Green Magma than this, but if you use this daily or regularly--as I do--it's handy to have the economy size. Sometimes, buying the 5.3 ounce size times two comes out cheaper (some vendors have the 5.3 ounce size for 13 bucks), as long as the shipping doesn't eat up all the savings.Now, the product: Great. I like to use this pre-workouts, along with Berry Splash and a protein mix (not mixed together, separately) in order to get the phytonutrients, potassium, and carbs/protein mix that suits me best. This also is terrific boosted with unsweetened green tea leaf powder. The two flavors mix perfectly. (I use Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder, which I get here from amazon.)Of all the green drinks, Green Magma tastes the best. It actually mixes well in a shaker cup and tastes very green and fresh for a powdered mix. And mild. It's pleasant (as opposed to the gag-arrific wheat grass and other green mixes I've tried.)I trust in the quality of this product, and I find it has a nice calming effect on my reflux-prone digestive system.Thumbs up.

I like to drink Green Magma daily as a snack between meals with some protein powder (such as Designer Whey or Slim Body Whey); and I like to take extra on days when I ingest salty products (say, deli turkey or something canned or cheese). It's got a pleasant, mild "green" taste (not icky like wheat grass), and it's very quick to mix. It has a nice amount of potassium, and, hey, green goodness.It's not a magic drink, but if you have days when you don't get your green veggies and maybe overindulge in salt, some green magma (rather sugar-heavy juices) may be helpful. (Coconut water is even better, being higher in Potassium, but that doesn't give you the "green" benefits.)I do think that the pleasant taste was the most surprising aspect. I totally expected something gross (magma???), but this has a gentle taste that doesn't make one gag. (Wheat grass and some blended green food products definitely are hard for me to get past the gag reflex for me.) And if it's hard for you to ingest your recommended 5 to 9 (or 11, depending on who you read) fruits and veggies a day, this is one aid.The information on the product says it has these nutrients and benefits: "beta carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, chlorophyll, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), 2"-O-glycosylisovitexin (2"-O-GIV). 2"-O-GIV is a water- and fat-soluble antioxidant found in Green Magma that effectively inhibits lipid peroxidation as well as the formation of aldehydes and other toxic compounds in vitro produced by free radicals. Green Magma also contains many trace minerals like selenium that have antioxidant actions."I live in the city and don't have a perfect diet. I also have assorted health issues. So, I take Acai juice and other phytonutrient dense products to help. Green Magma is in my arsenal.And if it tasted like pure crap, I wouldn't recommend it. It tastes way better than genuine acai berry juice. :)If you get it, I recommend you get one of those 8 or 12 oz shaker cups with the lid you pop on and off to shake the Green Magma up easily and clean it simply. I find my small shaker cups get used A LOT, between protein powders, berry mixes, green tea extract dilutions, and Green Magma.Enjoy, and be well,Mir

I've read through Volume 8 without writing a review. I've enjoyed every trade paperback volume, mind you, but last night, reading THE HARD WAY, I was blown away. It's that good!For those unfamiliar with the series, the title is the starting point: A man named Graves comes into the life of assorted characters with a briefcase containing a gun, bullets, an insightful and personalized dossier, and carte blanche to the case's receiver to do wht they see fit with the weapon and ammo--with full immunity. No cops. No prosecution. Full out "get away with it" revenge, if they want. The dossier gives the proof to the, "This is the person that done you wrong." The bullets and gun say: "Go kill em. You got the all clear."The targets of Mr. Graves particular attention may seem unconnected at first, but as the tale progresses, those lives--of those who live, anyway, through their tale--come to intertwine in with a deepening background story arc of epic proportions.It all starts to weave together.Before this volume, we've seen snatches of what is going on behind the scenes, the complex nature of what Mr Graves is involved with. It's a long historical thing with far-reaching consequences. There are powerful and wealthy families, secret vows, enforcers, backstabbings and betrayals, changes in system, and it can be headily confusing at first.In THE HARD WAY, we begin with a seemingly unrelated little criminal tale that has a seedy, anxious feel and serves as a wonderful set-up--a prologue, if you will, or a tone setter-- for what's to come. One character, who has served as a sort of narrator during the story, advises us that all good stories end in tears. We're about to find that out firsthand.The whole conspiracy theory set-up (including the hilarious Snapple theory in the initial bar scene) is a brilliant set-up to the uber-conspiracy theory that is the next, meatier tale. We move into a story that gives us the past and the core of Wylie and his woe (and it's BAAAAAAAAAAAAD GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD stuff). Wylie's been in previous volumes.Set in New Orleans for a good chunk and including some interesting secondary characters (but everything is woven together gorgeously, viciously, movingly, bloodily, tragically), we finally learn the background of the Minutemen and the deeper significance of the important term Croatoan.The twists are just too good to even mildly spoil. So, no hints and no more plot info. Just get ready to get your throat clenched and head whiplashed around by a story that just gets darker and wilder and better.Man, I'm impressed. Not just by the story. I've been loving the visuals of this all along, and in this one, visuals and story seem to continue that amazing coherence and slickness. It's potent stuff. I'm so glad I have Vol 9 and 10 to read today. :)Mir

I have the red cover initial version of this. I had enjoyed this so much years ago, and had forgotten the details, so decided to REREAD it. I find it's still a thrilling, engaging read, with characters to root for. I still love the odd detective Vanadium, the wonderful Agnes Lampion, the quirky doom-obssessed brothers, the lovely charmed children. Familial love and the power of GOOD shines in this story. The relentlessness of demented evil is also present in the form of "Junior"--a villain whose POV , when Koontz puts you in there, is disturbed and disturbing. Koontz does a fabulous job of letting you inhabit a deranged person's head.The story traverses years and has several principals, but Koontz keeps it from being confusing. He has a wonderful talent for handling the cast and situations--the whole weaving of threads to bring us to the momentous day(s) is so cool.The one star deduction comes mostly from noticing, on reread, that he gets mighty wordy at times. I didn't notice on first reading because I was all about turning the page to find out WHAT NEXT, WHAT NEXT! On second reading, as I could take my time and wasn't totally in the dark, I noticed the verbiage. The metaphors taken to, occasionally, silly extremes.I also remembered that I thought there would be this apocalyptic sort of fulfillment at the finale...like, a bigger scope. Which is hinted at, but not given.All in all, first readers should be thoroughly engaged and delighted. Only really critical readers may roll an eye here and there at the extended metaphors or pages that feel like filler.Those are minor in the end. Koontz delivers. A terrific writer who knows how to keep you turning pages and rooting for the kind people. And I love that he puts in spiritual perspectives, which many modern writers would be loathe to do as not being cool and skeptical enough. God watches from the corner of his eye...I don't know if there was ever a follow-up novel to this that gave us more of Angel and Barty and Mary, though I know I want to read that. If there is, could someone leave a comment and let me know? THANKS.Enjoy...

I first noticed Daniel Craig in the first Tomb Raider flick. I thought he was good looking, loved his voice, but didn't really feel anything like the "it" that Angelina Jolie puts out (in contrast to Gerard Butler, who held his own very well with Angelina in the second TR flick).But in this one, Daniel Craig OWNS the screen. It's very hard to look at anyone else when he's there. And it's his magnetism and the constant plot twists that make this film highly watchable. It's stylishly directed, and the casting is really faboo--Michael Gambon, with a very strange fakey tan look, is, as usual, a blast to listen to and watch. His homely face acts up a storm. Daniel Craig, with a sort of semi-wrecked handsomeness--look at those deep-set, small, haunted eyes, those grooves and creases that contrast with that smooth blond hair, that constant natural pout that makes it seem as if he's always plotting something or regretting something. The supporting cast do their jobs, too--Colm Meaney, Sienna Miller, Tom Hardy, etc.This is not a cheerful world, this world of drug dealers with their secrets, their machinations, their grudges, their vengefulness, their greed, their odd loyalties and betrayals. And it's not supposed to be cheerful--even if sometimes the predicaments our protagonist gets into seem nearly comical in their complexity and jolts.So, Daniel Craig plays the dealer ready to leave his criminal world, retire, and take a hot blond chick with him to post-criminal happyland. Unfortunately, fate is against his plan. His boss orders him to do this last job, you see, and this last job is anything but simple. (I won't go into the plot much, since other posts here do that in great detail, down to the last twist, nearly. Help yourself to any spoilers here you wish. I'll skip spoiling the twists, okay?) Every time Mr. X turns around, something gets in his way--and the bodies start piling up. And he's doing everything he can to get out of the tangle and end up alive--and with blondie--and find a life out of the layer cake that is the hierarchy of the criminal world.I thought the ending was perfect, given everything that's come before.BTW, watching this AFTER Casino Royale makes it very clear why Craig was a viable candidate for the Bond job. Look at the way he handles Gene's (Colm) gun, very Bondish. Look at how he walks--the confidence--when he's suited up. Look at the way his eyes can grow deadly cold, and always have this ghost haunting them. Perfect for the new, more serious, less gimmicky Bond.I grew up with Sean Connery as the definitive Bond. No one displaced him, even the charming and handsome Mr. Brosnan. After Casino Royale, Craig is my favorite Bond. And in THIS film, LAYER CAKE, the elements that made him a fabulous, driven, lithe, fast, menacing, love-smitten James Bond are all in evidence.Daniel Craig is on my list of fave actors now, after Casino Royale and Layer Cake. He's got "it", and both films reflect it. So, the main reason to watch this plot-twisty film is Mr. Craig.Mir

I've read some of the reviews already posted (from Christians who are touchy about the subject through to those who clearly are Anti-Christian and delight in poking fun at believers). The diverse opinions suffice to tell you this is not as simplistic or poorly done a film as some might suggest. I do not understand the reviews that say they are confused and don't understand. The movie is hardly that complicated that you can't get some coherent understanding of the plot.NOTE: I may review more detail than you wish. Consider this a spoiler warning, although I don't give it all away, I wouldn't want you to feel cheated.First off: I'm a believer. Yes, I believe in God, Christ, the Bible, the historic creeds and in the Rapture to come (I'm post-trib, for those who care). With all that, I liked this film. I enjoyed Mimi Rogers' performance and I enjoyed seeing the journey of this troubled character. We're not dealing with a character who does things in moderation. When she was pre-Christian, she didn't just have sex, she had SEX!, promiscuously, in groups, etc. We learn it's her way of filling this void she feels, the boredom of her meaningless existence. She attempts suicide. She's a mess. BUT...she has a vision of "the pearl" and it gives her a sense of peace and soon she's turned her life over to God and she's a Christian with a Z for ZEAL, evangelizing anyone she can--on the job, on the phone, friends, strangers. To some believers, this seems quite fine and laudable. To some, it will seem strange and immoderate. I think that's part of the interest. Where is this woman going now?The movie has this haunting air about it. You get a sense of being on the edge of doom, which is suitable given the subject matter. Even when she's all aglow and talking about God, you get the sense this character is rushing headlong into another type of excess. The character may have found something that gives her purpose, and a stability, but something about her is still unbalanced emotionally. Even her "peace" is an excessive peace. Tragedy befalls her--SPOILERS--stop reading if you don't wanna know:--when her husband is murdered in a killing spree at work, and still she keeps this strange calm. You don't see her really break down or do anything a normal grieving woman--Christian or otherwise--would do. It's rather spooky.When she has visions that beckon her to the desert, visions that gave me the willies and seemed kind of sinister, like a haunting--visions that have even her church's Prophetic Boy warning her that they stand unconfirmed by other believers and might be from Satan--we have a growing suspicion that something will go terribly wrong.And it does.One can look at this story as the descent into madness of a never very stable woman and wonder if anything in those last minutes is real or if it's all imagined, sanity banished.From a Christian perspective, I take enjoyment in a more literal reading that, despite any directorial intention is the most taken away from the film. This is a woman we've seen crack up, a woman whose been kept in check by her faith, her husband and her church. When she loses her ties to a husband, who never had that weird, glazed look like the main character, and when she then distances herself from the accountability and safety net of a church by heading for the wilderness, and then when she allows her faith to buckle, she's left with nothing to stop her from rashness and crazed decisions.What should this woman know? She should know from her church sermons that to go into the desert is typically a sign of temptation to come: Jesus went into the desert and the devil tried to get him to move away from his mission and disobey God. Here, we see a woman who is tempted, perhaps not by Satan, but by her own desires. She wants to be raptured. She wants to go to heaven. She wants to be done with life down here. She wants the culmination of her faith. She's tried to die before and failed, she wants to go to the better place. The temptation is great, so great, she forgets simple admonitions she surely knows by heart--Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt love the Lord thy God, thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the test.A simple prophetic warning that is uttered by the Prophet Boy and subsequently by the character's daughter, one that is ambiguous at best--"Don't expect God to meet you halfway"--is twisted, as any advice can be, to suit one's emotional needs or fears.To Christians, some things will irk. For instance, the innacurate rendering of a well-known Biblical doctrine/verse: We love Him because He first loved us. Well, here it becomes, "He loves us because we love him." A total turnaround of truth.The Controversial Ending: To any orthodox (not as in Greek Orthodox but as in traditionally doctrinal) Christian, the ending is not controversial. Are we suprised that God both showers grace and forgives at the last minute or that he implacably judges and condemns? I think not. We know He does both.However, God shows his grace by giving the character multiple opportunities to make a different decision. Providentially, someone she knows from her past shows up near the end. Then another character counsels her. Then another gives her an example. So many chances....Then character chooses her final fate, all the while unwilling to see where she is at fault. It's easier to just blame God.The director/writer may have meant this to be Anti-Christian. Dunno. I didn't HAVE to take that away from it. I could choose to see it as an examination of a particular character with specific weaknesses and how it manifests in the context of Christian eschatology. The other Christians aren't shown being cruel or harsh or encouraging disastrous outcomes. Ultimately, this is about this ONE woman. One woman's choice. A very pro-choice film, actually. And the ending may cheer fans of INVICTUS, but it will make most of us feel pity.If one wants to see it as a mental degeneration of a troubled woman, that works, too. But I don't think it works as well as accepting the ending as "real". The film's power works only if the woman's choice is a true-life scenario and not the mental figment of a lunatic.The Rapture can lead to fruitful and interesting discussion after viewing, even for believers. I recommend it.

I like the simplicity and painlessness of this item for help in controlling the facial hair issues that cropped up in middle age. I use three tools, since waxing is too irritating for me, and I didn't feel like paying for electrolysis/laser zapping: 1. an epilator that pulls out the larger hairs along the chin line 2. this facial groomer for shaving off the hairs along cheek and neckline and above lip and 3. tweezers for eyebrows/between brows and hairline area stragglers.This is a very quick shaver that is minimally irritating (I have super-duper sensitive, eczema/dermatitis prone facial skin, so I wouldn't use this if it weren't gentle.) It's like this teeny tiny shaver, light and battery powered. A nice tool.I like having a very smooth hairless face, so I remove hairs that others wouldn't care about (ie, peach fuzz). Makeup looks so much better when I use this facial groomer--smoother, almost airbrushed.If you hate having excess hair anywhere on your face or neck, and you don't want the iritation of regular shavers or hot wax, you might wanna try this. I like it so much, I bought two to have a back-up on hand.I've been using the first one I purchased for more than a year already, and it's still going strong. So, good quality, too (though it looks simple and cheap, it's been working fine, as a Panasonic should.)Mir

If I had fair hair, I probably would have let it slide. But I have almost-black hair, so when it sprouts on my face, even a couple ones, they're quite noticeable.Well, the bane of middle-age for a lot of ladies is new growths of fuzz on the face (particularly above and beside the lips and on the cheeks). I have three things t hat I use to groom away the hirsuteness--an epilator that tears out the longer hairs, a tweezer for the fine ones, and this one for general use (especially good when I'm in a hurry and can't tweeze). I use this all over--chin, cheeks, forehead, eyebrow line, neck strays, between eyebrows, as needed. I have ubersensitive skin, so I use an anti-redness moisturizer afterwards to soothe, but this groomer only offers minor irritation compared to other shavers I've tried.A very good, easy to use, not loud product. Nice. Essential for this middle-aged gal. I'm about to buy a back-up.Note: Even if you don't mind some hairs on your face, but you're someone who loves to use a full makeup--ie, foundation, powder blush, powder, etc--using this first makes the makeup look so much nicer and smoother. I always use this before a big event when I want the makeup to look really good and smooth.

Once set, you're good to go. Reading the watch is not a huge undertaking. Just have to get used to it a week or so.I love the look of this watch--rectilinear and sexy in a futuristic way. The multi-colored flashing lights are great for Xmas--as it's reminiscent of tree lights. :) A fun watch. (I originally wanted the blue lights one, but this went on sale, so we got the multi-colors. And you know, I like it. It's not crazy-tacky garish as I thought it might be. It's just cheery.)One star off in the rating for being really unbalanced. The "head" part is thick and heavy and makes the watch want to slide to the side of the wrist. If it fits snugly, it would be more stable, I guess; but this watch is too large on both me and my hubby, so we're going to need to have a jeweler shorten the metal band. Otherwise, I like it a lot.If you have a larger wrist or wear it outside your cuff, it should be perfect. Otherwise, expect to have it loose or shortened to fit.Mir

I'm not Indian. I don't speak Hindi. This was my first Bollywood flick (although I'd seen "music videos" of Bollywood numbers on tv over the years and enjoyed them). I loved the movie (although the ending seemed to drag on and on and I was ready for a resolution 30 mins before it finished. The beginning and middle are great--Aish Rai is amazing, clearly, one of the loveliest women to ever walk the earth. Graceful and just stunning. The leading man is handsome, though not nearly as charismatic as Aish. The second guy is quite good--some comic relief and just rather fun.The story: It's a love story. Boy meets talented country girl. Boy's family is rude to venerable father of country girl, causing boy to rashly blame girl and kin. Girl stalks off to meet record producer and become great singing sensation. Boy realizes he was wrong and is all achey about it, but knows the girl will be his. It's destiny, ya know? Eventually, girl IS his. Happy Ending. Yay!The cinematography is lovely. The music is OUTSTANDING. (I found a phonetic site with the words, and I got the soundtrack as a birthday present, and this CD rocks!) The idea of loyalty to family and everlasting true love are staples of Bollywood (and I'm a sucker for both, coming from a big Latin family where you respected mom and dad and didn't dishonor your kin; and being married to the sweetest dollface on the planet.) Yes, I'm a hopeful romantic.So, if for nothing else, rent this to 1. See pretty picture! 2. See prettier Aishwarya Rai! 3. Hear pretty, pretty music! 4. See happy lovey-dovey ending.Someone criticized Aish's crying in a previous review. Well, if I looked THAT good when I cried, shoot, I might cry more often. The big number of "Ishq Bina" with the tears and all was faboo.If you've never seen a Bollywood flick, this is a nice place to start.Now, if only they could make the movies tighter/shorter.Mir

A boy of humble origins. A girl of aristocratic lineage. They bond as young ones, they are separated. He becomes a gifted illusionist. She becomes the beautiful, strong-minded woman a crown prince needs to complete his particular ambitions for power. The illusionist performs, and suddenly, the city is under his spell. Is it real, what he does? Or it is just tricks? And will the Chief Inspector of Police be able to contain the growing danger, the political and social and personal repercussions, of the illusionist's actions, which increasingly incite treasonous (if true) accusations from his captivated audiences?The game is on, and it's on at many levels, personal and social and in the very palaces of power.The ending is, well, look at the title of the movie, watch the film, and take a wild guess at how it ends. You may be right, as I was. No surprise.And yet, some pleasure. Quite a bit of pleasure. Even my hard to enthrall hubby sat through the whole thing and didn't once say, "Gee, how long is this thing anyway?" as he usually does when I put on a DVD. :)I like Edward Norton. I find his odd looks interesting, and I enjoy his acting talent. I find him versatile and with an air of depth about him that adds quite a bit to his dramatic endeavors, even when they are small, like his part in FRIDA. The man stands out for me.Jessica Biel surprised me. I'd only seen in her in one other, hardly satisfying film, the third in the BLADE series, so to see her convincingly elegant and intense (if not particularly brilliant) was a special and unexpected treat.Rufus Sewell has done royalty before (Charles II), and he has done bad boys before. He's got a sort of ferocity behind those eyes (one somewhat wall-eyed, which adds to the air of oddity) and he can act, for sure. He has a masculine power that makes him believable as a sadistic exploiter of women.But Paul Giamatti. Wow. I wouldn't have imagined this almost non-descript, unsexy guy could steal a movie, but steal it he does, right out from Norton's and Sewell's much more attractive noses. He's a complex character, walking that line between corruption and integrity, and that's always fascinating to watch, much more interesting than a mere good guy or a mere bad guy. Delightful. And the series of expressions on his face at the end, when he figures out what happens (for himself, for the audience) is a marvel to behold.The cinematography, the use of dark/light, the occasional startling use of red, the music, all these make for a terrific visual ride. One can forgive the giving of too many clues that ruin the surprise just for the fact that it's delicious to sit and watch these images unfold.And Norton manages to move beautifully as the illusionist--the hands, especially. He convinces me that he is what he is.The tricks are always fun to watch. I"m not so jaded that I can't have fun with it. Or the director and actors just make it fun. Whatever.Great tension (sexual and otherwise) between actors, and a bit of romance (love that first kiss, ahhh), and a glimpse at the power of people who will not be cowed by the powerful and corrupt.I recommend it for the above reasons.

I'd definitely see if there's a health food store that gives samples, or an organic restaurant that carries this, or a friend with it--try it before buying.I was used to French's and Heinz's yellow--staples in my fridge along with Grey Poupon and Gulden's. But I have been, in the last year, switching to organic products and produce. I purchased this to replace my about to expire French's yellow mustard.Well, this stuff is awful. I don't know why it has that odd taste--the vinegar, the particular mustard seeds?--but I put this on a sandwich and hated it. Then I decided to try again, a different day, and again, scraped it off the turkey. I could not bear it.I threw the nearly full bottle away.For now, it's back to non-organic mustard until I can taste other organic mustards and find one that doesn't make me wanna spit out my food.Pity.Mir

I'm lazy. I've bought tons of green tea products over the years, but if I have to heat the water, mix the leaves (or bags), etc, wait for it to cool or pour over ice, I tend to flake and just reach for whatever ready-to-drink bottled or canned sort of beverage is handy, super-healthful or not.This solves my tea-sloth issues. Small foil packet that opens easily via a notch. Mix with water. Voila, a really nice cup of tea you can heat in the nuker if you like, or just go with it iced (or room temp) like I do.The tastes is very fresh, no bitterness (like I can get with making hot tea, cause I'm a tea idiot apparently). It mixes so well (no big clumps). Totally a quality product.I ordered three boxes the first time (August 12, 2008). I'm gonna order even more now, though I still have some left, just to have in stock in my pantry.Not only do I love this as a refreshing beverage (that can be punctuated with lime or lemon, or splashed with a healthful ounce or so of blueberry, cherry, acai, or pomegranate juice), but I started using it as my pre-workout caffeine punch. And know what: It works. Having this 35-40 minutes or so prior to my Pilates hour-long session makes me put in some extra effort so I'm wonderfully sore in the core the next day from the boost of energy.This is unsweetened (a plus), so you can sweeten it to your heart's delight, with honey or stevia or, if you're watching calories, Splenda or Equal. And, hey, yeah, sugar works, if you swing that sucrose way. And though I have a sweet tooth, I've been drinking this unsweetened. It really tastes so...greenly refreshing.Totally love this tea mix. I wish amazon carried it in their amazon prime catalog of products so I could get it with "free" 2 day shipping. Still, my experience with this supplier was great. No worries.Mir

I got this on a whim, but when I opened it, instead of an oolong scent, it was really strong herbally/floral thing going on. I thought I'd hate it. Surprise, I found it quite delicious. Normally, I don't go near some of the ingredients of this tea (I hate peppermint tea, for example), but this blend just knocks it out of the park. It's definitely worth a try. Had I gone just by the ingredients list, I'd have passed it by and lost out on a lovely tea experience.

I have been so hooked on my Rishi and Twinings and gourmet coffees in the last couple years, that I pretty much haven't bought Celestial Seasonings teas for a spell. Well, yesterday I went to a birthday "tea party" and I wanted a non-caffeine variety. So I picked this one.HEAVENS! I had three cups. So lovely. Beautiful deep red color. Really nice aroma. And totally tastes like cherries (which is a flavor I love).I came home and ordered up a 6-pack on Amazon (hope it's not a staler batch, as I've had issues in the past with ordering tea/food items from Amazon and it being close to "sell by" date).This is gonna make crazy good iced tea. I could tell sipping it hot, that this would become my second fave iced tea, displacing the Republic of Tea's pomegranate one. :DIf you like the cherry flavor in foods and beverages, and you like to eschew excessive (or any) caffeine, you will want to try this. If you're afraid of getting a 6-pack, then just get it at your grocery store, but try it. This is delicious, delicious!I do wish they'd spell out the specifics of the ingredients--like what these "natural flavors" are from. I have a lot of sensitivities, and I worry about the undisclosed. But, I didn't have a reaction at the tea party, so should be okay. :Dthumbs up. Enjoy.

From defeat in a bloody battle, his armor riddled with arrows, Lord Daigo enters a temple that houses the 48 carved statues of demons. There, despite a priest's warning, he makes a pact, seeking power over his enemies at first, then reaching for power over the world. In exchange, he agrees to the demons' desire--the body of his soon to be born child. Daigo's forehead is marked to seal the dread pact.Move forward some years, and a palm reader reads a hooded man's hand and asks: "Didn't you die a long time ago?" The hooded stranger, revealed to be a handsome fighter of skill and some highly unusual limb-related abilities, engages in battle with a masked demon. When he wins, we see his prosthetic lower leg be replaced with a real one that magically grows in.A female-dressed-as-male thief sees this astonishing regeneration and seeks information on the stranger from a traveling minstrel--be he man or monster. The minstrel relates the tale, of which he was part witness and which feels very much fairy tale meets Moses tale meets Frankenstein, of how a baby with missing body parts is reescued and "completed" by a healer's exceptional skills. This part of the film has a lovely folkloric quality about it, and the visuals are partly grotesque, partly moving, aided by the semi-lullaby sound of the soundtrack. The healer's cottage verges on the steampunky.And so we enter the quest of the grown man--who is sometimes called Hyakkimaru, the name on the blade in his left arm-- to obtain once more the parts of his body that were sacrificed in infancy and his vengeance-driven thief sidekick--who dubs herself Dororo, a name that could equally apply to the strange man of removable limbs as the meaning of "dororo" is little monster. Like most good fantasy/fairy tales, we have a special weapon forged to kill magical creatures (goblins, demons), a mentor in the Shaman who gives Hyakkimaru his regenerated body, and allies and antagonists along the way, not all demonic. The horrors of war and warlord tyranny runs through the whole of the film.Some of the demons are cool (the spidery one, the moth one), some not so much (the heinously awful reptile one should have been edited out, honestly); the composite child spirits was awkward). But by the time the climactic showdown comes, and we see the weird family dynamic at work between Hyakkumaru and his kin, we end up feeling sorry for a host of folks, because the father's initial act of child sacrifice has some ugly repercussions. Will reunion bring vengeance, redemption, good, bad?I will note that this is not a complete story--by film's end, Hyakkimaru has obtained only half of his demon-confiscated body parts. But the tale still has a satisfactory conclusion, with character growth and tragedy and a bit of redemption.I enjoyed it visually (mostly) and storywise (mostly). And the actor who plays Hyakkimaru is a hottie. (Bonus!) The English subtitles didn't seem odd (like in some subbed films I've seen from Asia), and the actors did a very good job.Mir

I'm a middle-aged gal with super-curly, prone to frizz hair. I have bought and tried so, so many shampoos and conditioner with the hope of finding something to make my wild hair manageable without having to pile on a gazillion post-shower products. You know, a shampoo/conditioner that really heljp. I imagine I've spent oodles of cash over the years trying the "designer" products from Aveda and Biolage to Matrix and Paul Mitchell to Redken and on and on. I've also tried cheaper ones (Dove, Clairol, etc).This one is excellent. I buy the restoratives frizz contol in conditioner, too.The smell is pleasant and not overwhelming, and I put it one before I pumice or shave, so it sits on my head a few minutes and soaks in. And the result is very nice, indeed. Even my husband notices the added softness.My hair will never be shining cascade of smooth strands. Just too curly for that. But with this product, I find that it's easier to blow-dry and have the hair feel softer, sleeker, and less prone (though never NOT prone) to frizzing in humidity. (Granted, when you have mind-of-its-own hair, addig stuff like Paul Mitchell styling lotion and Biosilk just adds to the effectiveness of the Pantene products, I find. It all adds up to help manage the hard-to-manage.)I'm pleased with this product and hope they (the folks at Pantene) continue to produce great stuff for curly, dry, frizz-prone hair that is reasonably priced. (Let's face it, high-end, "designer" hair care can get wacky pricey.) This is in the higher range for Pantene shampoos (given you get less than with the other Pro-V products I've previously used), but it's still not up in the salon products range, with salon products results (and better than many).Proof I like this a lot: I"ve started getting rid of the other shampoos in my shower stall, and I have a back-up pair of the shampoo/conditioner in my hall closet. Just so I don't run out.Bonus Points: I have extremely allergy/dermatitis prone skin. So much so that I have to use Cetaphil on my face rather than regular soaps or facial cleansers, can't wear mousse in my hair, can't wear eye make-up of any kind or most blushers, and have to test everything or risk a violent reaction. This shampoo (so far, knock wood) hasn't made my scalp itch or get scaly. It seems to work well for this sensitive-skinned gal.Very nice. Worth a try. Recommended.

Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.However, with this crazy hot summer, I'd recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until fall's cooler weather. You might get a sticky, clumped mess of Pocky sticks in this deep summer weather. (Look for local stores that specialize in Japanese anime or manga and they'll likely carry Japanese snacks like these. In South Florida, Tate's Comics has them in a variety of flavors..and FRESH and NOT MELTED).Also, if you want to risk summer shipping, the shipping here for ONE pack is crazy. Do a search for Amazon-prime Pocky or Pocky with Free Shipping (such as by ToysDiva).

There's a surreal, playful quality mixed with a dark undercurrent in this story of two girls who want to be themselves, run their own lives, dress and work (or not) their own ways.In this case, Momoko is the ultra-girly Lolita girl in her laces and ribbons, parasols, and platform shoes. Ichigo/Ichiko is the biker girl in her student's uniform and ninja boots. Momoko is concerned about being brave enough to grasp happiness, even if happiness is defined by her idea of Rococoo--eating sweet things, dressing loligoth, being pretty, and working as little as possible. Ichigo wants to work on bikes and have the happiness of true, egalitarian biker friendships. Neither girl likes being told what to do.There are obstacles for both--Momoko's hapless father and his sales schemes that backfire, her mother who went off to find her own happiness (with Momoko's oddly mature childhood blessing), and being stuck in a non-stylish rural place where frugality is valued more than high-end beribboned fashion. For Ichigo, it's her bad temper, ignorance, and the change in her gang that turns it from a small sisterhood to a bigger authoritarian clan.But each girl has her strengths, which become evident as the films goes on.By becoming entwined--first via an ad placed by Momoko to sell her father's banned Versace knock-offs in order to get cash for her loli clothes, an ad that draws in Ichigo, who needs stylish wear for a wedding--and by developing a contentious but deepening relationship, these two very different girls find that at core, they have fundamental traits in common: they want to be themselves, and they are both courageous in their own ways. They start out rather horrified by each other--it's hilarious to see Momoko's reaction on first meeting Ichiko/Ichigo, along with her habit of spitting and head-butting.There's excellent direction, cinematography, acting, and some amusing animation. Stories within stories. The Lolita store, Baby, The Stars Shine Bright has its own role here. Lovely unlikely scenes where Momoko takes flight. It has humor, too, and this film is delightful, particularly since the two main roles are so well-cast. Momoko really is doll-like visually, while having a tough streak inside. Ichiko is really tough outside (a transformation for the lovely Tsuchiya, for any who've seen her fashion shots or videos), but has a gooey, romantic core.I've seen this film twice,and I would happily watch it several more times. Well-told, engaging, playful, a bit gritty, and just plain fun.Why these girls are called "Kamikaze" is beyond me, unless it refers to that spirit of "I'm alone in this journey, and I'm giving it my all, even if it kills me." I'm really stretcihng the metaphor, but that's all I could figure. They're young and single-minded and individualistic, and a bit sad and lonely, and they're strong. I guess that's a kamikaze sort of spirit. Probably just some doofus picked a catchy word from the Japanese lexicon, though. Heh.Recommended if you like movies that are quirky with individualistic female protags.Mir

I disliked THE DRESDEN FILES tv show, but a friend said, "Read the books. You'll like them." He was right. The show was a letdown, but the book (the first one, the only one I've read so far) delivers.Here's Harry Dresden, a wizard in contemporary Chicago, low on funds, high on wizarding skills, pretty smart if not always duly cautious, and a likable guy with several secrets the first novel isn't revealing, but only hinting at. In this first novel of the series, Harry is called upon by the police to investigate a truly gory magical killing (hearts burst out of the chests of victims) of a hooker and a mafioso hit man. Also, a wife comes to call to ask Harry to find hubby. Harry needs the dough from both cases, but he also finds he better solve the major one fast, or he will be a very dead wizard. And then the second case gets real complicated. Oh, and he's hoping really, really hard that the sky stays clear of storm clouds...The strong points: 1. Madly accelerated plotting--lots of action, page-turning pace. This is a quick read. 2. Harry is a hoot. It's fun being in his POV, since he's not perfect, but he tries to be as honorable as the situation allows. You want him to get out of the crazy jams he gets into.3. Creative problem solving: Butcher paints Harry into tight, wild corners, and then he finds story-justified ways of getting him out, just barely alive. Thrilling!I was particularly fond of the fairy scene and the naked showdown.Not so great point: I think I least liked the cop lady character. She was just so overheated. Too much temper wears on a reader.I've already ordered the next four books in the series. I think that's the best testimony I can give to how much fun STORM FRONT was to read.If you like urban fantasy and detective stories, this blending should suit you down to the ground.Enjoy,Mir

I love this product. I love it so much I have one bottle in my bathroom and another in the hall closet as back-up, so I don't run out. Since my hairdresser used it on me in July, I haven't looked back and my Paul Mitchell and Pantene have been sitting unused. This really has added beautiful softness and a greater manageability to my dry, frizz-prone hair.Thanks, CHI.Mir

This will be a dual personality sort of review. I will review it first from the point of view of The Old Mir, who once read tons of category contemporary romances. Then I will review it as The New Mir, who has moved away from such reads.This way, whether you are part of one camp (the fan of inspirational contemporary category romances) or the other (the non-lover of ICC romances), you can still get something out of this post to help you decide if this novel is one you would enjoy.A FAMILY FOREVER is an inspirational category romance (that means it's Christian in perspective and has no graphic elements, sexual or otherwise.)It's the story of a godly, attractive man, Tucker, and a conflicted Christian woman with a tragic past, Shelby, who also happens to be the fiance of Tucker's late stepbrother, David. David died in a motorcycle crash. Tucker, a talented cycling enthusiast who makes his living selling sporting stuff, feels responsible. Shelby, who is pregnant from a premarital bit of whoopie with David, feels shame and finds herself in a tight spot, what with being alone, pregnant, pretty badly off financially, and uncomforted by a not-very-sympathetic mother with emotional issues of her own.So, this being a romance novel (and those of you who have read more than a couple dozen category romances know what's coming), a Marriage of Convenience is suggested by Tucker, who feels oodles of guilt and a sense of responsibility, being the honorable man he is. His suggestion is accepted by Shelby, who feels she has no other options and is riddled with guilt at taking advantage of Tucker. But hey, she does anyway. He's insistent.The novel is basically the two of them working out their guilt issues and their romance. Shelby has to deal with that past that keeps her from being able to fully invest in a relationship. Tucker feels he must prove he's a sensitive male and that they can make the marriage work. Shelby wants not to be a burden; Tucker reassures her she's not. You get it. That kind of general romantic angst abounds.If you are in Camp Inspirational Category Romance Lover:You will definitely enjoy this novel. It has the internal conflict and hallmarks that will fill your romantic reading needs: the tortured heroine, the rescuing hero, one of the more popular stock premises, the comfy-home-sanctuary, the adorable pooch.Tucker is a delicious hero. Frankly, he steals the novel right out from under Shelby, who as the one who has to make the largest change, is the real protagonist. Only she didn't grab me. He did. I'd marry him, and that's the biggest compliment you can give a romance hero, right?There are some truly sweet and moving moments, especially in the latter third of the novel. The kisses carry the requisite impact, and you'll find a very satisfying epilogue. (I remember loving those kinds of epilogues when I was a category buying fiend.)Shelby, however, annoyed me a lot. I wanted to feel sympathy for her plight, but she was so immature, so non-deep, so "insensitive jerk"-y. I mean, that's the accusation she hurls at Tucker (later repenting of it), but the truth is, he's not at all insensitive, he's not at all a jerk, and she's the one who I want to slap down and say, "Grow fricken up!" And, on top of that, she remains kinda amorphous through most of the novel, not really starting to fill out as a "real" character until the latter chapters.Fortunately, after an annoying bout of Shelby, you are bound to fall into a scene with Tucker. He's a more clearly presented character, and wonderful enough as a he-man-with-heart to make up for Shelby being a brat-twit.For Christian readers, your spiritual sense ought to be nicely satisfied by the repentance, prayers, forgivings, and conversions that come along in the last third.I'd give this 3.5 to 4 stars from a Camp One perspective, mostly for the good scenes in the last part of the novel and for the truly wonderful Tucker. Loved him! And the ending scenes gave me the warm fuzzies. That's always good.Now, if you are in Camp Inspirational Category Romances Make Me Yawn:You will probably yawn a lot during the first third of the novel when not much happens. It really needed some good conflict to propel things, but it wasn't there. A clear hint of real trauma finally shows up one-third in.The secondary characters are flimsy, flatter than two-dimensional. (Which is not unusual in shorter category novels, so is hardly a huge demerit. It just didn't realy add to the story, especially the gal-buddy.) Some devices are introduced that are never used fully (Tucker's second job, for instance), so I wondered why they were even there.I wondered the same thing about the scenes with the best friend. One didn't serve any purpose at all that I could figure. The friend was...well...space filler.Overwriting is also a problem. We're hammered over the head over and over and over about "She's suffered. She's pregnant. Her fiance's dead. Of course she..." It gets old after the fith or fifteenth time I, the reader, am told of her being pregnant/grieving. Yeah, yeah, I know!Some of the metaphors struck me oddly. One in particular made me stop reading and go, "huh?" It's about Tucker and he "reversed direction like a ping-pong ball bouncing off a paddle." (p. 128) I actually had this image of Tucker whooshing into the kitchen like a ball. Heh.And one of my personal pet peeves of romance made an appearance: Overuse of heart descriptors. I actually had to stop and retrace when I found conflicting heart metaphors on one page, then another page with two heart metaphors. Hey, it's me, I hate that. I'm sure there's some metaphoric thing I misuse, but this is my peeve. I once stopped reading a Steeple Hill novel mid-chapter one when I encountered 4 heart metaphors in the span of two pages. FOUR. I thought the heroine was going to need a cardiologist and a very tricky operation to cure her racing, jumping, constricting, thundering problems. This may not bother YOU, though.There isn't much conflict. There isn't any real external conflict at all. It's all internal. If you need to have a story with a strong external conflict and plot, this ain't it. This is an internal read, an emotional read.However, if you want to give this novel a try, Camp Two-er, consider that there are some lovely scenes of genuinely sweet affection, of "falling in love", of moving humane consideration for another human being, of a man being what we women want a man to be. Remember how millions of women the world over just about fell out of their beds in a swoon when Mark Darcy says, "I like you just the way you are," to Bridget Jones in the movie? Well, I got something of that sort of feeling when the following happens:{Shelby} turned on him. "Are you suggesting that I have some kind of problem?""Honey, I'm suggesting you have all sorts of problems. But I am absolutely on your side."Or much later in the story, this:"Talk to me," he urged in a melting-chocolate voice she had no power to resist. "Tell me the stuff nobody understands."Sigh.If that sort of hero and those sort of story moments do it for you, then get A FAMILY FOREVER.My rating for the Camp Two-ers is 2.5 stars.So, gentle readers, decide which camp you fall into. If you fall into Camp One, definitely get this novel. If you're in Camp Two, you now know what to expect, so don't say I wasn't fair.And if you want a taste of A FAMILY FOREVER, you'll find most of the first chapter available for preview at BrendaCoulter.Com.This review is excerpted from a longer post at MIRATHONhttp://mirathon.blogspot.comMir

Kinuko Y Craft is an exceptional fantasy artist. I have several novels on my shelf with her art on the cover--and her artwork always catches my eye in bookstores. I also own a coffee table book of her art. And in my bathroom, I have hanging last year's WOMEN OF ENCHANTMENT. The artwork is stunning--full of myth, magic, vibrant color, luminosity. Just a delight to look upon it shortly after waking. :)The calendar boxes per day give enough room for one to jot down appointments and birthdays--as I do.But it's all about the art. Bring some beauty into your new calendar year. :)MirUPDATE: Okay, received my calendar 12/18, and here's the artwork on it:January: Hermione--a mournful classical style female with Greek classic columns and a soft blue sea behind her. Reminds me of those 19th century sleepy women paintings.February: Claire's Wings--dark foresty space surrounds a lovely, fair fairy giving off a golden glow as she admires her reflection in a pool. I've seen this image on other products--cards and bags. So, it must be one of Kinuko's popular ones.March: Ozma of Oz--reminds me of Renaissance portraits. A lovely young woman in an elaborate gown in her room, a scepter and crown on a cushion beside her, and through a window, a castle high up with clouds behind.April: The Queen of Icemark--Warrior woman with dramatic black horse and white leopard and battle scene behind. The leopard is stunning.May: Sacred Ground--a peaceful seaside landscape with a Native American looking beauty (or maybe some fantasy ethnicity that's a cross between Indian (West and East) carrying a basket. A serene dawn time of day. Very nice.June: Psyche Weeping--an interesting composition with a mournful tone, a lot of dark greens and black as we look at a pool reflection of Psyche with her head in her hand,w eeping. We don't see her, only her reflection.July: The Barque of Frailty--A moonlit night on a street reminiscent of Prof. Higgins' street in MY FAIR LADY, but a woman in Empire white gown and gold shawl lieson the stone stree, letters scatterd about her and flying up in a breeze. She is so pale, may be dead (or fainted). A beautiful, but tragic painting.August--The Ghost of Netley--A woman in Regency white gown and airy shawl walks in the forest in moonlight.September--Sleeping Beauty--She's awake and half-risen on her white silky bed, prince approaches, but attendants still slumber. Dark surrounding the central luminosity that is the blonde princess.October--Water Sprite--a light-hearted painting suffused with early sunlight as a water sprite stands on pointe on the surface of the sea and a magical companion rides a butterfly alongside.November--The Transformation of Angarred--One of my fave of Craft's works (one I've seen elsewhere and before) of a half-woman/half-leopard (mid-transformation?) sipping at a forest pool as a dark and mysterious knight figure watches on his steed, a wagon and a low golden moon in the distance. A magical scenario with a sense of curses and menace and journeys.December--Cybele's Secret--which is the cover illustration as well on this calendar. One of Craft's signature "chock full of lovely stuff" compositions, very detailed, cool blues and greens and also golds and whites. A visual delight for exploration of the intricacies.Ah, I love my new calendar!!!Mir

I'm giving this five stars for the fact that it seems to be processed properly, it certainly has no added sugars, and it came really quickly from the supplier.However, be warned. If you've never had this product, it does NOT taste like a berry (or what Americans have gotten used to thinking is a berry taste). It's not remotely sweet or yummy. It tastes like...well...the closest I can describe it to you is that it tastes as if you'd mashed a bunch of black olives and slurped them down. (Not like olive oil, but as if black olives made juice.) This is NOT a lovely taste.However, if it does anything remotely like what the folks around claim antioxidant-wise, then it's worth the not-so-pleasant taste.I'm suspecting that if this is what 100% acai really tastes like, those other products, like Mona Vie (which is quite sweet and fruity), are adding a lot of non-acai stuff.Anyway, there you go. Quick delivery. Much cheaper than Mona Vie. Not so delectable taste. But think of it as medicine, I guess.Mir

I find a lot of trance electronica rather dull. Yes, repetition is part of the experience, but you have to be creative to put things on top of the repetitive lines that intrigue the brain or move the spirit.This is the best psytrance album I've heard. It has interesting things going on, and DANCING GALAXY is outstanding, truly, one of my top fave electronica tunes. I dare you to sit still, I dare you not to feel carried away with the energy and complexities. Fabulous. The title song is tops. But others have this sort of infectious groove that may need to build for while, but when it hooks, it hooks hard.The track called Ambient Galaxy (one of those DUNE related songs by A.G.) reminds of what it felt like to be a kid dreaming of going out there in space (like we baby boomers all figured would become kinda normal in the 21st century, hah.) Terrific build-up, with Virginia Madsen-as-Irulan providing voice (film lines). Lovely bits of "hitch" in the beat.Flying Into a Star has a video-game sort of ferocity/speed, and you can actually visualize yourself rushing like crazy right at and into some wild star. No one is sitting still through this.Some cool "percussion-like" effects. I could almost sense timbales in Life on Mars, a tune that brought to mind HACKERS, the flick. It would have fit right in with that soundtrack.I'm also a big fan of DUNE (first read it as a teenager, and have read it a dozen times since), so the tunes that make reference to the story (using lines from the Lynch film version) are a special delight.This is great for dancing, great for driving, great for just energizing and letting your mind go out into the wide open OUT THERE spaces.It's a pity it's not in stock and the used are so pricey. This may be ten years old, but it still makes the grade in my book.If you can get your hands on it, get set to start trancing away....Mir

Okay, I just discovered Da Vinci syrups last month, and I like them a lot. I love this cherry one. For low-carbers, this can go in so much: yogurt, seltzer water for diet cherry soda, in Coke Zero to make it cherry coke zero on a whim,and my current fave way--over grated ice to make a sno-cone. I love cherry sno-cones, and here's a way to have it without sugar and calories.I use the Egg Nog flavor in almond milk or milk and it's a nice holiday-flavor. And the Toffee one in WonderSlim toffee pudding to enhance the flavor. The coconut one I use in hot cocoa to amake it German Chocolate cocoa, and it's also nice for sno-cones (though the cherry is better).I get mine at Netrition (where I've shopped low-carb items for years). It's a couple bucks cheaper in price and the shipping is much more reasonable (at less than five bucks per order).I'd recommend the product for dieters, especially low-carbers, but not this seller's pricing/shipping. No way.Enjoy...

Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The flavor of the strawberry (which I prefer to the chocolate) is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar), but a serving (five pocky sticks) is 70 calories. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge. But if you can stick to just a few at a time, you can easily have a fun Japanese snack for 100 or fewer calories (figure 14 or 15 calories per stick).If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.

I decided to buy this based on the good reviews and the fact that Guillermo del Toro--one of my very fave directors, and the director of my fave ghost story--The Devil's Backbone--produced this.Well, no disappointment here. Not in any part. The acting, the direction, the scenery, the set design, the script, the music, the ending--it all worked together, all paid off.This starts off slowly, gently. But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large, mansion-style orphanage--the shadows, the direction, the way the action of an innocent game is set up--perfectly sets the tone of the film. It's nostalgic, but it's also slightly creepy. It foreshadows a lot. Pay attention.Zoom years later. One of those children who'd been playing in the yard, the girl Laura, is now grown with a son. We find out the main characters--mother Laura, father, son Simon--have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children. Simon, himself, is a special needs child: He has HIV.Soon, the game of "invisible friends" takes on an ominous reality. And every scene builds tension, builds, builds, until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question--of the lead and of the viewer--how far will a mother, this mother, go to find her missing son?While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on (the clues are all there, and the script does not cheat), it's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work. Almost all is fairly foreshadowed, but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I cannot describe how beautiful the finale--the climactic moment-- is. Tragedy, sorrow, redemption and beauty all coalesce. It is a miraculous cooperation of acting/direction/storytelling/setting/lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely, too, leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings, mortal beings, and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed--that's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes, this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily, and the scares are surely present, but it is not a gore-show. It is a more human and artistic ghost story, and is in fact MORE than a ghost story. It's a story of family and friendship, and of a mother who will not give up, because the deepest love outlives the grave, even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film. Magnificent. (And pay very close attention to EVERYTHING, for all the strings come together in the end.)Mir

I put off watching this film after all those demolishing reviews. I figured, "Oh, well. M. Knight dropped the ball."But, I was in the mood for a fantasy flick and this one was available ON DEMAND, so I went for it. And I was surprised at how much I managed to NOT be bored and to ENJOY it.Lots of reviewers and other places synopsize the story of building superintendent Cleveland Heep and his efforts to aid a stranded visitor from another, watery world get home safely, so I don't need to do that.I do have some thoughts/opinions:Yes, Lady in the Water has problems: The terms don't seem to fit the mythological origin. Story won't talk about who's who, but she blabs on about the future (that was kind of annoying). The scrunt wasn't as terrifying as he ought to have been. The secondary cast was terribly wasted--I mean, geesh, you cast actors like Jeffrey Wright, Mary Beth Hurt, and Jared Harris, and then you sort of ignore their own individual stories? And then you have that whole blabbering gang (of which Harris is part) and that big Latin family (who are shown in the first scene) or the kid with the half-developed body, and we never, ever find out who they are or what they're like or what they fear or anything about them. They're utterly cardboard. And convenient.On the plus side: Paul Giamatti rules. He absolutely makes you care about his character and he's so watchable, even when he's doing something really stupid, like acting like a kid. (Which fits in with the themes, but still, silly.) And Bryce Howard has an otherworldly look here that is perfect, and her presence fits the character. Bob Balaban is a joy whenever he shows up in any film, the man is THAT good, and he is terrific here with the small bit he's given to do. Pitch perfect. And I like that little introductory story done with primitive artwork in the beginning. It sets the stage for a fairy tale in an urban setting.Now, I understand that this is, in fact, a bedtime story, a fairy tale, an urban fantastical allegory. Naming the narf "Story" sort of gives that up fast. But when you're going to set up a complicated team of players that must cooperate to achieve the happy ending, well, I think it's incumbent on the writer to develop the story in such a way that the cast is fully fleshed, not simply, "Oh, here's the piece I need in this instant, and I'll move it here now, even though I've ignored it for an hour plus. Voila. Surprise." Bad, bad plotting/writing. A bit more time with all the players would have done the trick. Or, one simply pares down the cast and makes do with the brilliance of a Giamatti, a Balaban, a Wright, a Howard, a Harris and a Hurt, perhaps, and call it a day.Still, I'd recommend that lovers of allegory or fairy tales or urban fantasy give this a go, and especially those who can forgive weaknesses simply because there are luminous moments. This movie has luminous moments, and for those moments, I say try hard to overlook the weaknesses and let yourself be carried away with the wonder of a child. For a spell.Unlike another reviewer who criticized the "watery bird", I think that particular shot was lovely. I think what Cleveland Heep says, the very last line, speaks strongly to the power of Story.A story, if you believe it, if you have faith like a child, can save your life.If Shyamalan indulges a bit petulantly and a tad arrogantly, even perhaps somewhat self-aggrandizingly, well, he may come to regret that later. Or not. And maybe he's just misunderstood. Perhaps.As a viewer, I say thank you for the lovely bits that are in LADY IN THE WATER, and too bad that it wasn't the better film it could have been with more time spent developing the story and characters. Some things ought not be rushed into being...Mir

There are some seriously whack characters in this anime--notably, some of the villains. Which is fine by me.Mostly, I enjoyed the combination of goofy-but-very-seriously-revengeful hero-in-black-hat with his ever-increasing coterie of fighters and crushgirls. The mecha elements are quite cool, as is the humor surrounding the laconic hero and his culinary peculiarities and less-than-astute awareness of what's going on about him. He pretty much is good in a fight, and exasperating to many otherwise. A loner who simply won't be left alone, which is amusing in itself.The finale didn't suck, although I will totally admit that I wanted just a wee bit more denoument and follow-up. After all the heartaches and heroics and antics, I really wanted to see loose ends tied up more neatly.But the ending is as silly-cute as much of the non-vengeful action stuff, so it is suitable.All in all, a visually fun, often quite nicely written, cute and action-packed mecha-mania anime where the English voice actors did a great job.Really, really liked it.Mir

This is far from a perfect film--Liv Ullman's performance is uneven, excellent in parts, really faltering in others--but when you have a film with such cool actors as Ullman, Kelly, Binnie Barnes, and a charmingly fresh young Deborah Raffin, and most of all a magnetic and very tempting young Edward Albert (he's never looked to utterly attractive than here), not to mention a fine supporting group that includes Nancy Walker (who is always a hoot), how can it be gathering dust, unforgotten?The story is not complex: 40 year-old divorcee Anne Stanley (Ullman) from NYC has a single day's fling while on vacation in Greece, and with a handsome young American tourist who is 22. She flees. Turns out the guy shows up as her daughter's (Raffin) date, and he's the scion of a very wealthy family and an executive in the family business. Anne's mom (Barnes) wants Peter for the daughter (money! social status!), while ex-husband (Kelly) wants Anne back for himself. Enter J.D. (southern rich client of real estate person Anne). Then the back-and-forth of Peter (Edward Albert) wooing intensely and Anne fighting him off due to their age difference, plus the interference from all and sundry. In the end, Peter's sincere and passionate pleas break down Anne's wall of defenses. Then Peter's parents come into play (Don Porter and Rosemary Murphy, doing a terrific scene with Ullman)...and Anne, pushed to her emotional limits, has to make a final decision.Ullman convincingly shows the increasing glow of an increasingly in love woman. She falters in the comedic moments (clearly, she's better suited to drama). Edward Albert makes you believe he loves her, and more importantly, makes you believe she SHOULD be with him, despite their short acquaintance and age disparity. Barnes is delightfully flighty, Walker is hilariously deadpan, and Kelly is the counterpoint to Peter. Peter is a young man who is mature and confident and dependable. Kelly is the middle-aged man who is only now starting to grow up. A secondary romance for Anne's daughter also is a foil for the central relationship.The movie is an interesting time capsule of the early seventies. Some of the outfits are absolutely, teeth-grindingly unflattering on the attractive Ullman. Others make you believe a 22 year old man would fall for her.All in all, a pleasant bit of a romp addressing an issue that still has not totally ceased to be pertinent. While, sure, we see more older woman with young men romances and marriages (Demi and Ashton certainly come to mind, as well as the now defunct pairing of Francesca Annis and Ralph Fiennes), it's still not as casually acceptable and the cliche pairing of aging guys with hot young gals (Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas, for one of many, many, many, many and too many to list.) Interestingly, Edward Albert married an actress, Kate Woodville, who was 13 years his senior.(Sadly, Edward Albert died in late 2006.)We haven't come THAT long a way, but we have come some of the part.This film should be released on DVD. I imagine many a middle-aged woman will enjoy imagining herself as the object of the fetching young Albert's attentions on a beach under a Grecian sun.Mir

...you might love that. Depends on how much you adore the scent of real rose petals (quality roses, not the seemingly fragrance free cheaper ones).I will say that for me, hands down, the best of the Les BAins Du Marais oils and scents is the MUSC BLANC. Wow, it's such a lovely, gentle, clean, pretty white musk, and I adore musk. But I got the set with the Rose Confiture (soap, gel, oil, scent spray), and despite not having alcohol, the eau de soin really has scent. Unfortunately, it started giving me a headache. It really is a genuinely rose scent, a pure and pretty scent, but it did not agree with my head.I guess I can only take rose scent in smaller doses (like the hint of it in the Musc Blanc).But if you go gaga for roses, unadulterated roses, baby, this is for you.

I am not Turkish, but I am one of those in-between people like the protagonists (living with two cultures, immigrant child of immigrants), so something rang very true here when I watched Sibel rebel against the constraints of a tradition that was more caging of women than men and more sexually guarded than the culture at large (it was similar in my Cuban upbringing).Unlike Sibel, I wasn't self-destructive and, frankly, unhinged.But the reason this story is so intriguing is because both leads, Sibel and Cahit, are people on a path toward death--he drinks to excess and attempts suicide via head-on collision with a wall. She slices up her arms and takes drugs, the biggest drug being one-night stands with men she hooks up with in bars or, well, wherever.They're both a mess, and it's painful and repulsive and fascinating to see them just make incredibly stupid, desperate decisions.Cahit and Sibel meet at a mental hospital (both after suicide attempts). She is a scrawny, wild-haired, but strangely mesmerizing woman; he is a spaced-out slob stuck in some dark groove. We see her light dimmed in her family's presence. We see her family suffering over her crazy acting out. And we see and understand why she sees this disheveled and suicidal and barely coherent drunk as her way out. They marry because what else can be done? That's how they see it. He has nothing better to do. She sees this as her only out from a repressive home environment. The director is savvy and sensitive enough not to paint the parents as tyrants squashing Sibel's spirit. We see they do love her, and we see that from their perspective, their way is right, and she is wrapped up in evil and shamefulness. They are not wholly wrong. She is not behaving maturely or thoughtfully or smartly. She really is acting like an immature, selfish, whacked out sex addict.The film lets us see the awfulness of Cahit and Sibel's situations, but we also see moments when their better natures shine through. As Cahit begins to actually fall in love with this woman who is wife in name only, who sleeps with other men and comes home with the dawn. We see him value the touches she brings--a tidier home, fresh Turkish meals she learned from her mother, just laughing together, dancing together. He begins to reengage with life. Sibel, however, is setting up a flashpoint situation.And everything will change with an act that is both understandable and criminal.The movie then takes a new turn, and we find ourselves in Turkey, where we know a stricken Sibel will either turn over a new leaf or meet her demise.And Cahit will find that his destiny is more and yet less than what he imagined.There are moments in the film where we cut to a scene of a turkish band (all male) and a female singer performing on the shore of some body of water--the Bosphorus?--with Istanbul visible across the river and the Haggia Sophia quite prominent. It's an interesting device that keeps us locked into a sense of another culture. The here (Germany) and there (Turkey), and that span of separation (the river)...all immigrants understand that metaphor.The two lead actors are rivetting. I've never seen them before, but the woman who plays Sibel has such intensity in her eyes, and she can look horribly unappealing or amazingly sexy depending on how she brightens or dims. The actor who plays Cahit has this same ability--he can be repulsive or appealing depending on a shift of expression, a change in the eyes or posture. They both vividly portray obsession and depression and living on the edge of destruction or salvation.It's a difficult film to watch, because deep human pain and stupidity are hard to watch without feeling superior at one moment, ashamed at another, compassionate another, and helpless another. You sympathize with nearly ALL the characters, who are in their way each trapped by desires and expectations and not fitting into some mold--whether it's the brother of Sibel, Sibel, Cahit, or Cahit's "uncle", or Sibel's mother and father...The message, life is hard, but you can make it harder or easier on yourself. And love, love is powerful, love is resurrecting, love can give you hope and fill you with life again, but love can also be something elusive and short-lived and, always, surprising.This film is not for a day you want to be cheerful. It's for a day when you're not afraid to see broken humanity and maybe commisserate and pray.

These are among the most comfortable styles of shoes I've ever owned. I bought them first in RED to wear with my black pants and pantsuits. I wore them out Christmas shopping (a lot of mall walking) and came home with pain-free feet. (I have plantar fasciitis that flares up when I walk a lot). Only my Brooks sneakers have been as kind to my soles. They fit like very soft gloves, but have some cush in the heels to give spring. Very nice. Oh, and I have hard to fit 10 size D width feet, so it was great to find a perfect fit.I liked these so much for comfort (though they are not as feminine as I might like, they serve well for casual wear), that I bought them in brown and black, too.A classic style with superior comfort. RECOMMENDED. Especially in RED. :)Mir

After reading--and tremendously enjoying--TenNapel's CREATURE TECH, I ordered EARTHBOY JACOBUS.Doug's official site has this blurb for EJ:" Chief Edwards retires from the Modesto Police Department a lonely man. On his way home, he hits a flying whale with his car, opening the beast's mouth to find a boy from a parallel universe named Jacobus. Chief discovers that a society of insect monsters want to kill this boy due to a mysterious virus that grows on his hand. He becomes a father figure to the boy and trains him how to survive insect monsters by becoming a great American donkey-kicker."That's the bare bones of a genuinely page-turning story,although you may not turn them as fast as you normally would because the artwork's of such good quality. I got hooked pretty fast.The wide-eyed, displaced Jacobus (a misfit/outcast type of character, my favorite) and the aloof, wounded old Marine ex-cop (who grows on you with each panel and who never loses his gumption, thank God, even when the nightmare swallows him up)--these two form a rivetting double-forced bit of characterization. You care what happens to them.As he did in CREATURE TECH, TenNapel mixes old-fashioned ideals and a spiritual component with vulnerable characters who need relationships and by grace find them. He doesn't let up on the action, but he mixes is with a storyline that will make your heart clench with empahty at the sheer human need for love (familial and romantic) and sharp recognition of the human condition that, sadly, includes suffering, alienation, loss and rebellion. He also highlights strength, persistence, loyalty, and second chances.How would I describe the story to you? Take a man running from God (like Jonah the prophet, if you will) and take Jonah's whale. Now, add a misfit boy from a parallel Earth that's been taken over by insectoid superbeings. Shake the ingredients. Now brainstorm the weirdest scenario and add a dash of romance and some redemption of the spiritual sort. Don't forget a pinch of patriotism: Add that tiny stars-n-stripes parasol, and voila! Tasty!Man meets boy; boy meets man. And a new sort of family is formed. Bad buys chase boy, boy flees or fights, and sometimes, you lose everything to do the right thing.You can expect the good guys to win, yes. And you can expect much laughter and some throat-clogging apprehension and just a rowdy good time.A review is up at Graphic Novels Info blog, which states:"Although it was the early scenes that sold me on the book, the late scenes definitely closed the deal. By that time (they've had over 250 pages, you know) the characters have grown considerably, and I don't just mean in terms of Jacobus being taller. And TenNapel gives us a series of flashbacks that give them even more depth, simultaneously adding depth to what seemed fairly two-dimensional scenes early in the book. Suddenly the Chief, who seemed like a pretty coherent and understandable character all along, turns out to have additional facets. Brilliant."I have to agree. Brilliant.TenNapel offers another graphic novel of Christian speculative storytelling that is top-notch.Mir of Mirathon blog and Speculative Faith team blogAsst.

As a chocoholic, I thought this bar would be one of those one-two punches--healthful ingredients plus the treat of dark chocolate. The combination of cherries and chocolate--be it in a cherry cordial by Godiva or a Black Forest cake is one of those perfect flavor duos. Sadly, the chocolate aspect is minimal, so I take a star away for that. I expected a burst of the dual flavor--cherry + chocolate. I didn't get that from this.HOWEVER, this is a very nice bar. The texture combines the chewiness and crunch aspects that make a granola bar fun to eat. It's not loaded with fat or calories like some other breakfast/snack granola bars out there. It has only 2 grams of fat (I'd tolerate more for a richer chocolate burst of flavor), and 4 grams of healthful fiber. No trans fat. 5 grams of protein. This is a good bar to keep in your purse for when a snack attack hits and you wanna sidetrack indulging in something junk-foodish.Every other bite, you get a nice tart surge of flavor from the cherries. That was nice.Now, more chocolate, please, Kashi folks!Enjoy...

Let's face it. No canned pineapple will have the deliciousness of the fresh version. Be it peaches or pears or whatever, can it and you lose something.What I like about these--and I buy them mostly to have on hand for pineapple cravings when I don't have the fresh fruit and for adding to Greek Yogurt--is that they are CRUNCHY. Unlike the more common and popular non-organic one you find at supermarkets, these still have some bite, aren't all mushy. I like that crunch. Flavor is good for canned.Pricier, sure.Very pricy compared to non-organic/Dole etc. Wish it were not so, but, well.And the cans are BPA free. You may see some comments here that say otherwise, but a simple Google search will bring up a guide that shows all Edward & Sons products BPA free as of last spring, and the pineapple (all varieties) are included in that list as BPA FREE.I buy this at Whole Foods, cause Amazon canned items can get pretty banged up.

Yeah, it's kinda embarrassing to review this, but as a service to other ladies who need lubrication past a certain age (ahem), here ya go.I tried three other types of drugstore lubes, and they all left me with bad odors the day after and often itching, too. Do I need this? NO! I just need something to replace what nature and time took away so I can continue to enjoy my marital whoopie.This is great. GREAT. I buy two bottles at a time to keep a backup in the linen closet. It has no smell, no taste, no funny PH-destroying ingredients. I have no day-after funky odor and no itching. None.It's perfect for what it needs to do.While there may be lubricants with more high-velocity slip (for those who are having the wild jungle variety marathon sessions), for most folks, this is going to be more than delightfully useful.My ladybits thank Sliquid.

~~~SOME MILD SPOILERS for first novel and, perhaps, this one, depending what you consider a spoiler. Be warned~~~Well, I was so totally delighted with THE CURSE OF CHALION , that I plunged immediately into the sequel, PALADIN OF SOULS, .This novel picks up three years after the grand and happy conclusion of the first. Here, the Provincara who first sheltered Cazaril (the hero from CHALION) is dead, and Ista--she generally thought driven mad by her sorrows, but whom wise and deep-seeing Cazaril came to understand was one of the specially-sighted, a once-saint of the Mother goddess--remains feeling more trapped than ever in the fortress under the care of the kindly, but overprotective dy Ferrej and her own powerful brother.She is still much angry with the gods for her sufferings and their meddlings-to her sense, poorly done and mostly ineffectual--in her life. She yearns, desperately, for escape. And so she does, under pretense of a pilgrimage to plead the gods at various holy sites for the boon of a male heir for her daughter and her husband, the rulers of Chalion-Ibra.But the gods are not done with their reluctant and bitter saint, and the pilgrimage turns into an unexpected and harrowing journey into the demon-infested and tragedy-haunted northlands, where Ista must choose to truly be a saint and work with the gods or remain in defiance and turn her back on a great need in her land.The choice will make or unmake her.McMaster Bujold builds slowly, as she did with THE CURSE OF CHALION, but once the key characters are involved--first dy Cabon, the portly and dream-touched divine of the Bastard's order; then the amiable and heroic dy Gura twins from the first book; and the sexually magnetic and magnificent leader Arhys, lord of Porifors, who lives with an uncanny situation and wounds from the past and present; and his stricken brother Illvin, who haunts Ista's dreams and is haunted in dreams by Ista; the spunky female courier Liss; the beautiful marchess Cattilara, obessed and loyal wife of Arhys-- and once the most dreadful conflicts emerge, the pace quickens and much action ensues.Will Ista find redemption, and will she become an instrument of salvation in doing so? Or is the dark conspiracy too much for a memory-haunted and shame-burdened royina (dowager queen).As in CHALION, the spiritually focused and dramatic climax is a beautiful and wondrous thing to read and experience.I still think that I prefer CHALION by a few hairs. I found the repeated capture and rescues in PALADIN a bit tiresome as we neared the grand conclusion. But the characters are sympathetic and flawed, and it is a pleasure to see them face huge obstacles. As in CHALION, there is a lovely romance we root for and heroic men and women who change the world into a better place by just doing what they can according to their abilities as the need arises, and sometimes, even doing what they think they can't, stepping out in faith or hope or love or for honor.The medieval Spanish/Portuguese echoes are strong here as in the first novel, and the villain is more gruesome. A curse of a different sort becomes the focus for humans and gods. Here, the Bastard god is at work, even as the Daughter goddess was focal in the spiritual action of the first book; and he is absolutely fascinating and quite a tease. The Father god, barely present in the first novel, gets a beautiful scene of his own, one that will resonate with Christians.The climactic battle sequences are very strong, quite moving, and rivetting, as this is no conventional warfare. I won't divulge any details, because plot points would be ruined, but LMB certainly opened the conduit of creativity to come up with this powerful endgame. I wept, more than once.This novel won the Hugo award, and it's certainly another fine offering from the very talented LMB. I look forward to delving into THE HALLOWED HUNT, even with the reviews not so glowing for the third in the CHALION series.Highly RECOMMENDED

I bought this by mistake. I was reaching for the Ritter dark choco marzipan my sisters and I enjoy when we get together, and this flavor had slipped in. Some customer must have dropped it back in the wrong display carton. Anyway, I tried it.This is TOO good. Seriously dangerous to any diet or dieter.The rum flavor with the raisins is amazing. The hazelnuts are just a nice bonus, but this is all about the choco with rum raisins. OMG, insane. I tend to avoid milk chocolate--I like mine dark. But this is really tasty. The combination is genius.Too delicious.I may have to wear dark glasses next time I pass the Ritter display, because I will be tempted to rebuy.If you're a rum raisin flavor fan, and if you can resist eating the whole package, then this is a lovely dessert treat type item.If you do buy, try to find is on-the-ground in your area. The prices on amazon are kinda nuts. At the Italian market near me, which overprices stuff anyway for being a small specialty store, this item is $3.19. They may have just put the shipping into the price, whatever. You can probably find it cheaper locally. And maybe fresher.If you are trying to lose weight: stay away. It's irresistible!

Spoilers Galore. Tread with caution if you haven't read the manga:I really liked Nana, the first flick based on the popular manga about two Japanese gals, both named Nana, who end up via coincidence/fate becoming roommates, then best friends. Both girls have serious relationship issues and both end up suffering setbacks. Together, though, they find a harbor with each other and start to move toward love again. The first flick had Ryuhei Matsuda as Ren, and while he's not as handsome as the taller actor who plays Ren in Nana 2, Matsuda was actually a more compelling presence and had real chemistry in his scenes with Mika in Nana 1.In Nana 2, rocker Nana's career starts to move forward, which is nice, but I get nuts about how she still keeps a distance from Ren,who clearly loves her and wants he to live with him. I do not get this girl and her pride, but pride is her main failing and it continues to be an obstacle. The other Nana (Hachi) turns into this really mushy, submissive, nothing, and it's horrible to watch. Really horrible. Here was this energetic, bouncy gal without much in terms of accomplishment (other than being a super cook and chipper cute gal), and in the face of meeting a mystifyingly distant one minute and mystifyingly insightful lover the next dream guy (played by the uberhottie Tetsuji Tamayama, who frankly gives me the vapors he's so hot), she turns into an aproned soulless mistress. Ick. My skin crawls.And yet, we do understand why she chooses the hottie rich rocker over Nobu. Nobu is sweet, funny, endearing, thoughtful and very easy to like. We think, "Oh, surely she's gonna pick him." But no. She picks the broody, thoughtless, but insightful hottie. And explains why. And, yes, we get it, but I still hated that she did.Nuff said.I loved the Hyde song they used in the first film, a terrifically catchy song you keep singing after the movie is over, performed very nicely by the Black Stones (the group in the flick of which Nana is the frontwoman). Glamourous Sky. (Do head over to youtube and search for the live performance by Hyde, shirtless, with Kaz on guitar, which is a real treat.) No song in this film caught my fancy. Pity.I agree with the previous commenters that the original Hachi had a certain charm and cute factor that was more muted in Hachi in Nana 2. Mika Nakashima may not be the greatest actress and all, but I think she does a really good job portraying Nana (the rocker), with her pencil-thin legs and arms and moody expressions. I love the scene where she comforts Nobu in the street after revealing to him a painful plot twist.I missed the delectably upper-lipped Kenichi Matsuyama, but the boyish actor cast as the bassist was quite adorably gangly and sweet.I wish they'd given Ren more screen time. Seems to me he was short-shrifted, and that actor was a hottie giving Takumi a visual run for the money.Really, if you like hot Japanese boys, this is a good film to catch some eye candy. If you like romantic themes and stories with musicians who will perform for you, this will do that. But be prepared to wanna slap both these gals upside the head for some of their choices.And overall, it's enjoyable, if lacking some of the drive of Nana, the first.

Pocky is just plain fun to eat. I discovered these snacks at an anime convention (though I'd heard about them before and had seen manga characters eating them). They are very, very slim sticks of biscuity stuff (the flavor to me is a cross between waffle cones and pretzels) that have a charming tiny popping crispness. The chocolate flavor, a nice non-bitter, non-dark, generically pleasing choco-taste, seems to be the most popular (given how fast they sell out at cons), but I prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream. Very nice.This is by no means a health food (it's in the same category as a cookie, it's got fat and sugar and non-healthful ingredients). But hey, it's junk food. We all know it's supposed to be OCCASIONAL and not habitual in the diet. Unless you're really prone to binge-eating or can't stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie splurge if you stick to a reasonable number. 10 of the chocolate pocky sticks will set you back 125 calories with 5 grams of fat, 3 of them saturated. I wouldn't recommend just scarfing down multiple boxes. In fact, just nibble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effect.If you love the flavor of coconut-chocolate together (like Almond Joy) try the coconut chocolate ones. They're really so good, oh man. Hubby says the taste reminds him of the Girl Scout 'caramel delights" cookies which are, in turn, similar to the old Yes Yes cookies (from the seventies or so).Anyway, if you have read manga or seen anime with young folks eating those stick-looking treats, or seen footage of cute Japanese girls nibbling at skinny little stick treats, this is what they were eating. :) Fun treats.

I will say up front that the music, story, voice work in Japanese (I didn't watch English version), plot twists...it's just really lovely. The only weakness is some of the roughness in animating the human movement...but it's a minor quibble. This is a lovely, lovely film.I won't say it has a happy-happy ending. I will say it has a beautiful ending, and everything that leads up to it is rather thrilling. It has some humor, some suspense, some sadness, some romance, and a lot that makes you wish you were young and had these great friends again, like we did in those days when we didn't have to worry about adult concerns, we were all about school-buddies-budding loves-etc.I also love the idea of what ends up mattering the most--what would YOU travel back in tme for?--and how sometimes we do get a chance to fix things, or we mess it up more; but nothing can be perfect, even when we wish it so. We just do our best and hope for better.I don't want to give too many specifics and mess up this film experience for you. Try to avoid spoilers. Trust me: This is best seen without knowing much of the plot other than, "Girl (Makoto) who has two guy best-buddies with whom she shares most of her time finds her and their lives changing--and those in her wider circle-- when she acquires the ability to time leap." That's all you need to know. More will spoil it for sure.Enjoy this beautiful animated film. It made me laugh, sit up and wait breathlessly for the next development, and cry a little. It broke my heart just a bit, then mended it some, too. Beautiful.

First thing you notice when you stir up the cup of cereal with the requisite water is that there are whole raspberries in there, not just raspberry flavoring or bits. Real fruit. Nice.I cooked it a bit longer (10 seconds) than the suggested time (1 minute, 45 seconds), and I let it sit three minutes. It came out fine. The texture is nice--you have real chewability here. Not mush. Real bite. And the sweetness is great for adults--not cloying, unlike cereals would appeal more to kids.The size is quite generous. In fact, I wish it was a bit smaller size, honestly. It's 300 calories for the whole cup (8 grams of fiber total). I find that I eat 2/3 of it and am fine. Besides, I like a variety type breakfast (ie, eggs with toast and juice, oatmeal and an egg white scramble with veggies, etc). I don't just like ONE thing (ie, oatmeal or just toast or just eggs). So, I eat part of this, save the rest to use as a dessert after dinner: I add canned peaches (or frozen) over it, sprinkle with cinnamon and add some honey, nuke it--my own little superfast peach cobbler. :)If you want a convenience hot cereal, this is a good choice if you like oats, barley and some subtle real fruit flavor and sweetness.This does have soy, though, in case you're sensitive. No dairy, though.Mir

I have been using the Stila Convertible for a couple years now. I started with Poppy, moved to Rose, then added others: Petunia, Fuchsia, Gladiola.Peony is one of the last ones I ventured on, because I didn't think it would suit my NC42 (warm medium-dark) coloring. I thought it would just be too light and a bit too muddy.WRONG. Wonderful cheek color on me. Very good discreet color that enlivens cheeks subtly for daytime. I love how it matches delightfully with one of my fave lipstick combos: Dolce Vita by Nars, the pencil, lipstick and gloss. This cheek color is perfect for that popular lip color.As I said, I'm on the darker side of medium, olive-toned. I can wear some of the Stila Convertibles on my lips, the richer colors--Poppy and Rose. Others are just too light. But for fairer ladies, I think lots of these colors would work wonderfully.I will add that having a quality brush makes application a dream. I don't use fingers to apply on cheeks. I find my MAC skunk brush (and the mini skunk brush) both apply beautifully, especially POPPY which can be garish if the application is not skillful.It's best to apply lightly and build up on the cheeks. It's best to use a lip brush to apply on the lips.I love this product so much, I went to eBay to buy "Orchid", a discontinued color. It's the darkest/deepest of the colors, deep berry. It's one of my faves, so a pity they don't make fresh ones.On a note for Asian-toned/Golden-skinned/Warmer skinned ladies: The gladiola is amazing. I thought that color would be gross, but it totally adds light and glow to the skin (as does Petunia, but that one is more like warm pink/coral). Gladiola has orange tones, but it's not clownish. If there is warm/gold in your natural skin tone, this will just LIGHT you up. I love it for warm/sunny days/summer.Petunia goes beautifully with MAC Cyndi (discontined) I love that combo.Lillium was one I tried that was a total fail on my coloring. It's definitely for fairer ladies.Anyway, I highly recommend this,e specially for aging/dry skin. I'm 52, and used to always use powder blush. But post-menopause, my skin got crazy dry. I can use foundation, the Stila blush, and no powder, and I look fine.Happy blushing!

I love artichoke hearts and I hate to cook, so when I can, I go for convenience: nothing's faster than opening a can.I was leery ordering a brand I hadn't tried like I had Cento, Haddon House, Whole Foods's 365 brand, other supermarket brands. But, well, the reviews and price lured me.Very glad I took the subscribe/save bait. I like these. Very good canned artichokes--and yes, we won't compare with fresh or even frozen, we're talking CANNED. Very nice. Very handy.I rinse them right in the can several times, then I can quickly saute them with some EVOO and garlic and lemon juice for a great side dish. Or toss them in pasta with spinach and aglio olio sauce or alfredo sauce. Or just some mozzarella on top. Toss them in salads. Add them to omelettes.I find this brand has less "toss away" hard or dark bits like some brands do. In fact, very little "toss away" bits. I think in the first can I tried, ONE hard piece I pushed to the side of the plate.I use them wherever it strikes me.Very happy I risked trying these. I will keep them on my S&S; to reorder as needed. Thanks, amazon. And thanks to the reviewers that made it easier for me to give these a shot.

I really enjoy Indian/Pakistani cuisine. When I do go out for curry, I tend to hit the vegetarian menu--Palak Paneer, Matar Paneer, dal, mushroom bhaji, eggplant bartha, and aloo chole being my faves.This is like a canned aloo chole--potatoes and chick peas. The curry has good flavor (though we know nothing beats fresh). It's got heat, but not obnoxiously so. I'd call it "medium" hot.The chick peas have a nice firmness. But I found only ONE little chunk of potato in the can I opened. One. Now, granted, the potato may have simply mushed down into a puree and is part of the thickness of the stew. Still, I think this would benefit from larger chunks of potato to pair with the nice chick peas.Note that there are four servings in the can (according to their measure). I don't think most folks would consider 4 ounces a portion, unless it's a side dish. If you are watching calories, note that to get the full count for the servings calories for the can, you'll need to multiply by four.This is the first of the Jyoti products I've tried. Today, I'm having their potato dumpling stew for lunch. I'll review that accordingly.Enjoy

Theses taste mad good. MAD GOOD.While it's not part of the Paleo lifestyle of whole, good, solid foods prepared wisely, for some of us, it's nice to have an option of a "candy bar" that is not total gluten-sugar-weird-stuff-crap.This is minimally crappy. :)Hubby agreed these taste great. He had to go to the bathroom more than he liked (these have fiber, and it MOVED stuff, not in a diarrhea-from-maltitol way, just MOVED it). Not me. No problems/issues with the sweeteners/ingredients.I use half a bar (or a whole bar) as an occasional dessert. Cause, well, that's what these feel like: candy!I wouldn't use these so much as a purse "candy protein" type bar. The coating may melt on you. (I refrigerated my case as soon as it came, cause it can get soft in transit. Chilled fine back to a nice glossy coating.)For my purse, I'd use QUEST bars for proteiny ones, or LARABARs for snack bars (not proteiny, but only real stuff in there, which is nice, as long as you don't mind that many carbs).For home dessert use or 'candy' fixes...this one is it. REALLY AMAZING YUMSY flavor. I kid you not. (And the whey crisps add that special bit of mini-subtle crunchiness.)It's not Paleo, but it's less damaging "sweet treat" with a punch of protein. I'll live with that just fine. :D (And I've lost 121 pounds, so having a smarter "candy" is vital to me.)Some stats:Serving Size 1 Bar (42 g)Calories 150Protein 9 gFat 7 g (Sat Fat = 3.5 g; no trans fat)Cholesteral 5mgmgSodium 65Carbohydrates 20 gFiber 6gSugar Alcohol 7gNet Carbohydrates (less sugar alcohols and fiber) 7 gOmega-3 100 mgPhosphatidyl Choline 250 mgL-Glutamine 100 mgCalcium 8%Iron 6%Contains "fish gelatin", so if you have an allergy, beware. I didn't notice a reaction (I am allergic to shellfish and fish), but I will probably not reorder, just in case.Enjoy and be well...(Order now in the cooler weather. I wouldn't order these babies in hot days/summer. They will just get gooey melty nasty.)

I bought these for a snack and for brown bag lunches. For me, just okay. They do have a nice fresh taste (not a stale, bagged flavor like some cheddar cracker sandwiches I've tried for convenience have had).However, the sweetness of the cracker threw me off. I like my cheddar cracker sandwiches to be savory--salty, cheesy--not sweetish.I think if you really, really LOVE Ritz type crackers and like the blend of salty and sweet and don't mind a sort of not-very-cheesiness to your cheese sandwich crackers, you'll like these a lot better than I did.Plus, they're organic, which is great.Just not cheesy enough for me to be thrilled.(I did love love love their chocolate creme sandwich cookies. Great cookies!)Mir

I had hopes before listening to In the Mean Time, because I enjoy female-fronted gothy or hard rock. I grew up with Pat Benatar and Heart, and I fell in love with Evanescence even before they went superhot on the charts, and I have a lesser appreciation (but still enjoyment) of Lacuna Coil and Within Temptation.In Gretchen's case, the group has passion and ability, but the music is predictable and there's nothing particular standout. They are an adequate band that offers some good listening for fans of moody rock with feminine presence. But I kept hoping for the musicians to do something that knocked my socks off or for the lead singer to really reach and soar. I didn't get there."Diamonds", especially, proves particularly unimpressive, downright boring, despite the lyrics sure to please Christians."Daisy Chain" opens up with some nice energy and a faster-pace, but then turns totally conventional and predictable. Still probably my favorite on the cd, just cause you got good vocals and fun energy. "I don't wanna be your daisy chain around your neck/ You loved me once, and then you forget." Ah, sorta forgettable lyrics here. But punchy and likable."Know You" seems to promise a darker turn, moody and the vocals a bit petulant at first, then strengthens up, but the musicians aren't up to the task (or ingenuity) of surrounding and lifting the vocals. They disappoint, even though the lead singer does a creditable job of expressing herself. The guitar work needs to meet the greater challenge of Mia's vocals."Breathe," pumps up the tempo, but at every point where you think--ah, here they'll take off--they don't. Youthful energy is there, passion is there in the vocalizing, and it's a song many will like, I'm sure, and one of the funner ones on the cd. I still kept wishing there was a really live and kicking guitar here to duel and ally with the vocals."Fading" starts out promising (and very Evanescence-ish), and one hopes for it to work out with verve, and some verve does come to the fore. The singer, Mia, stretches up with her voice and doesn't bobble in the pleading chorus. Nice. It's an enjoyable song, but a total copycat, and at no time does it break out and give itself its own, unique sound. It's still a respectable performance. "I"m fading inside, lately I cannot find myself."And that last bit, "I cannot find myself" is a problem I see for Gretchen's debut.I'll keep my eye (ear?) on this group. GRETCHEN may simply need time to mature into their own unique sound and to experiment with fresher, more complex interplays of instruments. I have hopes, because I see the potential there.I would disagree with the comparisons with The Benjamin Gate--a band that had some truly outstanding songs that caught your attention and hung on and vocalizations that felt fresh on several tunes. (Although in the more reaching, higher levels of her voice, yes, Mia reminds me of BG's gal singer.) I do see faded echoes of Evanescence, but without the soaring power of Evanescence (particularly on that outstanding debut record of theirs).For now, GRETCHEN impresses me with its basic foundation and potential: They're promising but need to go to the next levels beyond the semi-copycat sound that hasn't found its true, deep, surprising footing. Yet. And I do think the singer is very good. I enjoy her voice and she outshines the songs and the other musicians.I'll keep watching and listerning for their breakthrough, which I truly hope comes...and comes soon. This gal hasn't met her needs or quota of gal-goth-rock.

I've been using Aquaphor for a few years now. At first, I bought it cause I was having some rash/eczema issues. But I found that it quickly replaced my regular Petroleum Jelly. I like this type because it's more hygienic than the tub and it's convenient from travel. I keep a 3 oz jar in my bathroom. I routinely use Aquaphor on my lips and around nostrils before going to bed.When I have a cold/flu, I keep one in the living room or by the bed to apply constantly to the raw-prone parts (lips, above lips, nose).It's one of those simple, useful items for a medicine cabinet and purse. Can use on scrapes after disinfecting. Can use to groom eyebrows (mine aren't bushy anymore, but, ya know).I like this a lot. Convenient. The tube is a better delivery method, keeps it hygienic. The tub, while quantity-wise is nice, you gotta dip fingers or a spatula in (if you're that mindful).Stay well...

I will not forgive them for what they did to the mother. Nuff said. Don't want to make this a spoiler zone. But I don't forgive them. It screwed up the story and made it go downhill fast.That said: This started out so well.The moment where Robert Carlyle's character (and I love this actor, on reason I rented the flick, the other being I enjoyed the first by Boyle) has to make his dread choice, and then he's running, running, running to the dock with those crazed "zombies" is really horrifying. I felt that buzz of suspense. Sure, I knew he had to survive to make the film continue, but it was directed in such a way that it worked. Scary!The futuristic concept of the isolated zone, military-controlled, the soldiers getting a bit lax, the survivors waiting for life to normalize, etc, all that felt nicely post-apocalyptic. I had, however, a hard time buying that anyone would really want to come back from a safe US to a corpse-riddled, ravaged London. Come on. Would you? Naw. I'm thinking I'd ask for asylum. It strained credulity.The whole reunion, angst, the dread of when the next virus surge would come, that was all well-done. But once the infection strikes again, it pretty much mostly goes to a place that bored me. Bloody and gory and brutal, but boring. And I had a very hard time sympathizing with the kids. When one stops caring if the children in a story live or die--that's problematic. I stopped caring. And yet, their situation was so awful, I should have cared. The script did not MAKE me care if they got eaten by ragies.The ending, however, had a glorious final bit of visual action. It sets this up for yet a third film in this storyline, too. But I doubt I'll be excited to watch it if it's going to do the same downhill slide as this one did in the second part. Suggestion: Make me care that the people survive, the way I did in the first film. I gotta want the leads to make it, or why watch? Flesh-eating isn't that rivetting.Mir

I've tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I'll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.But, really,can't recommend it.Ingredients:IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.

Love this little knife. Been using it since January, when I bought it here on Amazon.In fact, I'd have to say, it's my fave kitchen knife to use daily. It feels nice in the hand, not heavy (I have a Wusthof that is beautifully feeling, but heavy, and nowhere near as sharp as this little modest baby). Easy to clean. Small enough not to be a pain in small kitchens with tiny counters (like mine).I have three other Victorinox Fibrox knives, including the larger Chef Knife, but I keep reaching for THIS one, so I'm getting a spare and one to use a a gift. With the 4 for 3 promotion, shoot, I might be tempted to get four and save a couple for Christmas gift-giving.I don't like to cook, but when you gotta, you gotta. And if you gotta, why not use something that's a pleasure to use and REALLY is sharp right outta the box. I couldn't wait to do the tomato test, and it passed with flying sharp colors.Enjoy!

I remember first hearing about this man who died from internal damage after having sex with a horse. I clearly remember thinking, uncharitably, "One less pervo." Yeah, not nice. But the idea of such an act is so repulsive, that one assumes the person is damaged and, in some strange way, has become "less than human." While repulsion, disgust, and horror is natural, I think it is unwise and unkind to dehumanize men (and women) who do acts that seem to "beast-ti-fy" them, in a literal sense.This documentary allows for the humanity of the group of men who gathered regularly to indulge in said repulsive sexual preference. It has a very peaceful eerieness, a sort of pastoral idyll gone wrong feel. Some scenes are very powerful--the man running frantically with a pailful of bestiality recordings across the greenness of a field in the Pacific Northwest (one DVD dropped for police to find has the name of the horse with whom the victim met his demise); the men walking in the dimmest of lights, on the way, silently, to the barn; the strange, subdued, darkened partying of the men in the house where they had their meet-ups, featureless, moving heavily; the actor playing Ken Pinyan shirtless in a stall, silent and expectant, and in another scene, quietly holding his son's hand in an observatory. Lots of beautiful, somewhat melancholic shots of the Seattle area and Enumclaw and Mt Rainier, too.We get a very clear sense of loneliness, alienation, need, and obssession, but it's all so fluid and quiet that it's almost poetic. Which is very freaky, given what we know is ultimately going on among these men with their dark urges--they get regularly sodomized by stallions. They record it. They share this obession online.But the documentary, while doing an amazing job of setting mood and showing the loneliness of those involved in this taboo, the difficulty they have of actually connecting in normal relationships, also shows that this perversion is what allows them to connect to each other. Perhaps the only thing that links them regularly to people.Where the major failures lie: 1. The missing parts from experts that might give us some insight (historically and contemporarily) about what leads to this sort of obsession/perversion/orientation/fetish/whatever. This man died because he had this urge he could not control. What might be at the heart of it. I left the film knowing not a whit more about zoophilia. 2. Its the lack of any insight into the taboo act itself or its repercussions to the wider circle--friends (if any), coworkers, and, above all, family. I found myself greatly sympathizing after the film was over for the ex-wife and son--who must be dealing still with the awfulness of what happened.We're never explictly shown (thank God) or hear described what killed Ken Pinyan, but the death certificate is shown in a few passing cuts, where we see that the sigmoid colon was ruptured. The mind reels at that moment, thinking of that. It's a bit much. The imagination simply does not want to go there, and yet it seems to be helpless to do so. Ugh.This film does serve one purpose. It's a gentle treatment of a very ungentle desire, and it balances the cruel jokes and snickerings that followed Mr. Pinyan's demise. I may have had an uncharitable reaction to hearing the news, but it enver occurred to me to start cracking jokes about it. It was only after seeing ZOO that I came online and realized the extent of the mocking and scorning. Wow.So, this is a small look into what happened that includes audio-interviews with three of the parties involved--two of them zoophiliacs, one the horse rescuer who came to take away the animals owned by the victim. While I am not fully convinced of the protestations that this is about loving animals (seems to me it's more about screwing them/being screwed by them, not actually loving them or treating them with dignity), I think we can't really address the things that go wrong in the human psyche/heart/soul/mind unless we allow people to talk about it and share their views.So, here is something of the perspective, desires, and the loneliness of the zoophiliac. Sanitized and beautified, but at least addressed. We won't admire these men. We might wanna walk away from them as fast as we can. But, it makes it harder to just think of Ken Pinyan as an internet joke.

Marilynn G. is my pal. I say that right off, cause I hate those gushing reviews that you KNOW came from friends of the author, reviews that wouldn't dare or possibly know how to be honest if you smacked the gusher over the head with a sack of truth-serum. They gush and spew praise, but say nothing useful about the work at hand.I want to be useful to you here, because I do want you to buy this book...because IT IS GOOD.I'm gonna gush, but I'm also gonna get critical, and I hope you trust that, despite my (not close, but affectionate) connection with the author, I'm not yanking your chain so you spend a few bucks.I simple will recommend you READ THIS NOVEL, because it's terrific...if you get past the beginning.That's the kicker: The first chapter pretty much sucks. It's strained, it's crammed, it's confusing, and some of the humor falls really flat. It's trying too hard to capture the quintessential Chick Lit voice, the one we heard in other novels, notably THE Chick Lit novel, Bridget Jones' Diary. (Which is fabulous, and you should read it, too! And the sequel.)But Marilynn Griffith, in this work, fails at that tone and voice.That's not a bad thing, though. Trust me.Persist through the pages. Once you get past that bumpy opening, you get an astoundingly good ride, smooth, touching, with only minor setbacks to the strained humor, which, thankfully, is eventually forgotten well into the tale.This is primo Women's Fiction. If you can get into a story of several women--and the men in their lives--and how they are all transformed by love, anger, jealousy, betrayal, forgiveness and the grace of God, you are going to dive deep into this truly human, warm-hearted, generous-souled effort.Forget the beginning. Plow through it to the meat. The meat is well-spiced and you'll find nourishment.You may already have grasped the plot, but here goes:Dana/Dane is a single gal staring at 30, who opens the story as a bridesmaid (with weight issues, in a too tight, unappealing dress) at the wedding of one of ther two best friends (Tracey and Rochelle, the Sassy Sistahs, once in the hundreds of hundreds in email, now down to three in real life and email.) Dana has been betrayed and hurt by the men in her life--brother, beaus, notably her one true love. There are disappointments with her father, too, a gambler-drunkard. She's been betrayed by some of the women in her life, too. (Can we say skanky-ho sister?) But Dana's got God, and she's sure he ought to be enough. (One truly hilarious moment has her asking this question to a single's group.) While Tracey marries to a former boyfriend of Dana's (to find trouble from honeymoon's day one), and Rochelle, single mom of Jericho, has her world rocked by a reappearance of Jericho's papa, and while Dana's new business consumes her life and health, Dana's once-true-love reappears as knight in shining leather. Things get a mite complex. Temptations and trials abound. She starts to lose control of her business, home, and relationships.But what is she about to gain, besides weight?Will Dana persist in singlehood, grasping it against all leadings? Will all her relationships fall apart? Will a terrible thing that befalls her undo her... or re-do her? Will she let herself love again the man who broke her heart, who sinned against her terribly? And what is God doing while things are going to hell in a soap basket all around her?This is a romantic novel--warmly, sweetly romantic. This is also a spiritual novel that doesn't shy away from depicting true faith, hypocritical faith, shallow faith, misguided faith, gentle faith, wacky faith, and shows how easily people can screw up their lives, and how gently and persistently God can put things back together.Made of Honor is a heart-touching novel with mercy and grace pouring out of its pages. There's no judgment in here, really. Just love and hope.Marilyn is gifted. Some of her passages sing to your heart, some whisper to your soul.Her editor should just let her write Christian women's fiction and advise her to dump the Chick Lit-tian aspects. Her strength is telling truth and mercy about women and men and families and friends...with a more serious tone than chapter one would lead some to believe.Ignore the tone and pitfalls of chapter one. First impressions can be wrong. The best is yet to come...Mirhttp://mirathon.blogspot.com

I almost didn't watch this. I hadn't heard of it, just stumbled upon it on Netflix. But the positive reviews had me try it.What a surprise.This is a very, very well crafted documentary-style (faux, natch)film about the death of a young woman and the way a family notices that something strange is happening in the wake of her demise via drowning. This starts very deceptively slowly, and then bit by bit, including using some subliminal tricks, builds a creepy atmosphere and a tragic tale with supernatural (or are they) elements. I don't want to give spoilers, but this is one where you may want to pause here and there to check out things that are emphasized or added to the scenery. There is a good hint in the opening shots of mediums/spiritists and so-called ectoplasmic/ghostly materializations. Those were so fakey, so clearly false, those photos...and yet they will echo in the truths and untruths that are revealed and unearthed in this tale.Photos and films and recording devices play a big part, as foreshadowed by the opening.The acting feels documentary natural. The way some of the pivotal scenes are shot/layered make for a heartbreaking revelatory concluding set of scenes. You will feel goosebumps and tears at the end.People lie. And people keep secrets. But sometimes the secrets and lies come out in unexpected ways...Really good scary flick.And make sure to watch at least the first part of the end credits. There's more there...

I love the CHI Infra shampoo/treatement combo. Really helps my dry, frizzy-prone hair. I also am using this silk infusion, but I find it's not as effective as BioSilk, my previous regular product.On the plus side, it doesn't cause as much breaking out as BioSilk does, so I alternate.I didn't find it had a strange smell, like the previous poster.I think if your wallet can take it, give it a try. If you're happy with another silk-ing product, stay with that, though. Why change if what you have works?But if you haven't tried the other CHI products, definitely try the shampoo and treatment (conditioner). Great stuff.But this is not a hair straightener, imo. It's a smoother, a "silkiefier." Does it do that? Yes. It doesn't straighten my curly hair, but it makes it softer, more pleasureable to the touch, and it helps a bit with blow-drying.Mir

Kinerase makes great products. And this one is no different. However, it is pricey. So, if you're happy with another cleanser, I wouldn't urge you to change.I have super-sensitive skin that breaks out constantly, and it's a never-ending battle to keep things in check (both the eczema and the zits). Kinerase products help oodles with the skin tone, texture, blotchiness, redness. Some anti-aging properties, and my sensitive skin doesn't react. Which is why I bought this. I like it very much, but I can use Aquaphor --another very gentle cleanser--and get good results for less.However, if you already use other Kinerase products and want the continuity/synergy of the products, yes, feel free to use this. It's good.Mir

This is a delightful group. Energetic and cheerful and powerful. An assortment of styles are presented--a fusion with American scat and hip/hop, San Francisco style, San Jose style, etc. I really loved the duet that included two of the male drummers in "fundoshi"--a white, twisted sort of thong that exposes the beauty of these athletic physiques and is not at all hard on the female eyes. :) Oh, sorry, where was I? heh...And the performance of, oh--er--i forgot the title, but it's this WONDERFUL dance-with-drumming sequence with male and female performers taking turns with the Odaiko as well as clacking their bachis (drumsticks) as they go through a dancing routine that includes kneeling and stylized armwork. Very pretty.The special features includes a subtitled look at the sort of verbal notation of sounds used by the drummers, including pauses. It is a resource for taiko drummers to replicate the performance. Very interesting.For those who enjoy dance and theater, there is a piece with a stylized lion costume inhabited by a performer (and he does a terrific job) with two other masked dancers threatened by the beast--but with humor--as drummers do their thing in the background.A beautiful sequence of excellent drumming and fine performances. I will watch this repeatedly. And I apologize that my knowledge of drumming and Japanese culture is so limited that I cannot do the descriptions justice. Just trust me and watch it. Lovely.Mir

I have temperamental, curly, frizzy hair. Just this summer, I discovered CHI shampoo. My hairdresser used it on me, and when she was done, I asked, "What did you put in my hair? This stuff is amazing."She showed me the bottle, and I immediately went online to order some for myself. I ordered two bottles of the shampoo and two of the conditioner. My husband has even commented on how soft my hair is now. And it makes my blown-out styles have a bit more control/less frizz.Is it miraculous? No. But it's an excellent tool in the fight for manageable, soft hair for those of us with dry-dry-super-dry, tends-to-frizz hair (like I do).I'm glad they have a subscription feature. I'm about to sign up for it. :)Please note: When you wash with this, your hair will NOT squeak. If you don't think your hair is clean unless it squeaks, re-evaluate. This cleans very nicely, but more importantly, doesn't dry out or strip. It takes a tad bit of getting used to (the way it still feels "oiled" or "creamed" in the shower), but it's an adjustment worth the effort.Note for the sensitive: I am very sensitive, allergy-and-dermatitis prone, and this shampoo has not caused any itching or break-outs. Although the silk leave-in products from CHI do clog my pores, but that's just the same as BioSilk (a great defrizzer that also makes me break out a bit around the hairline/chin).Mir

I wanted so hard to give this a full five stars, because Osborne is just such a good writer. Your eyes skim smoothly through the prose, you stop and laugh out loud here, you stop to wipe a tear from your eyes there, your heart gets all warm all over. She has such a gift, Osborne does, and her greatest being that of creating unconventional heroines in hard-luck situations who have amazing backbone and integrity, even when life stomps them down a few times. You just have to love her tough gals!Unfortunately, Osborne's villains do tend to be on the cardboard side--sociopaths with no redeeming qualities. Yeah, I like my good guys to be good, and my bad guys to be bad, but I like some subtlety, too. That's my main quibble with SILVER LINING--which is nevertheless a terrific read and one I recommend to all lovers of Western romance, or just plain romance in general. Low Down will win your heart, no question!My other quibbles--a very shopworn cliche plot situation at the end of the book which is beneath a writer of Osborne's true talent. And a hero that is just not really an equal match for Low Down. (Same problem in The Promise of Jenny Jones). I'd like to see Osborne's next one give us a hero who is as gritty and tough and deep down wonderful and well-drawn as the heroines she crafts.But I'll BUY that next Osborne, just as I've bought all the preceding ones. The woman can write. The woman can make heroines that make me want to hug them and make them my best friends. It's a gift, I tell you. : )BTW..if your heart doesn't just break over the things that happen with the spoon on the book's cover, you need to check that ticker of yours. And if you don't laugh out loud several times over the early scenes with the miners and Low Downe and the preacher, or later on about the &quot;dawdling&quot; (inside joke for the novel's readers), you're just plain &quot;daid&quot; inside, ma'am. *Mir*
