"Spinout" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In "Spinout" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on "The Donna Reed Show". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single.

"A Charlie Brown Christmas" should be seen by everybody by now. It's an unforgettable and memorable Christmas cartoon that has Charlie Brown as director the school Christmas play. The problem is with the rest of the gang, because they all think, especially Lucy, that is a "big commercial racket that's run by a big eastern syndicate". I, Josh, think not! When Linus, adresses evryone in center stage after Charlie Brown delivers his world-famous line, I fully agree with him! The rest of the Peanuts finally shape up and decorate the once next-to-a-twig tree. Lovely and essential!

&quot;Speedway&quot; is not too bad for being one of Elvis' last 5 pictures. I like the restaurant &quot;Hangout&quot; because the booths are cars. Elvis and Nancy Sinatra blend together in &quot;Speedway&quot;. Bill Bixby is Elvis' &quot;buddy-buddy&quot; manager, who thinks he's a chick magnet, like so in &quot;Clambake&quot;. He's only there for comic relief. Elvis is the true star. I like the fight scene where Elvis punches the man who plays Paul, a rival stock car driver, into an open elevator. &quot;Speedway&quot; still proves Elvis rocks!

"Elvis: That's The Way It Is (Special Edition)" was a hit in January 2001 when it aired on TCM. I love this documentary. On TCM it read: "In November 1970 Denis Sanders directed the documentary 'Elvis: That's The Way It Is.' It chronicled Elvis as he returned to live performances after making movies in Hollywood during the '60s. Most of the footage shot was unused in the final film and remained lost in studio vaults. Until Now. " Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer rediscovered over four hours of lost footage showing Elvis rehearsing and new concert footage and compiled most of it in here. This is truly something for evrybody to see. Don't try to pass this one up. As shown, the show is a complete sell-out and the seats in the showroom are packed. Elvis in concert in August 1970 at the International Hotel in Vegas in one megashow. That's the way it was!

Great musical that is very colorful. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye are two ex-G.I.s when after the World War II, they pair up and go into show business and become sucessful. Soon they pair up again with a &quot;sister act&quot; (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen), and head for Vermont where they are &quot;booked for the holidays.&quot; They draw in the crowds at the ski lodge in Vermont where the janitor there is the old Army general (Dean Jagger) that Bing and Danny knew. Within time, they gather up there old army pals and secretly prepare a show for General Waverly. It's quite a tearful moment when it happens. Afterward, the film closes in a vibrnt and gleaming &quot;White Christmas&quot; musical number. Great Christmas musical extravaganza! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Arguably, the best nostalgic musical. &quot;Grease&quot; finds John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John reunited in high school after a summer on the beach. They try to be like each other and impress each other in their own ways. John Travolta looks his best in this film. I think he WAS a natural-born greaser along with Henry Winkler. The movie does take you back in time to the '50s even though I wasn't born then, though from the movies I see, and the '50s music I hear, I don't doubt it. The movie was a 1978 box office hit. 20 years later, it was a hit all over again. Boy, I remember that! It was so popular again. I can't compare it to &quot;American Graffiti&quot; though. That's a classic that's just not appreciated enough by my generation. Getting back to &quot;Grease&quot;, if you like films of this genre, go for it, but don't go for &quot;Grease 2.&quot; It just doesn't cut it and was a flop. Greased lightning strikes once in the same place. It's right here!

In May of 1968, Stax was in a dilemma. The distribution deal with Atlantic Records ceased to be since Stax opted out of the Atlantic/Warnermerger. Thus, they lost the lion's share of their back catalogue to Atlantic plus Sam & Dave, who were merely loaned to Stax and were initially Atlantic artists, not to mention Otis Redding from the December '67 plane crash that took his life. A prominent figure in the Civil Rights movement had also been brought down: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and it was in the Memphis area. With so much on their plate, it could have been the end of the line for Stax.However, with the mighty audacity and go-power of Al Bell, Stax was going to start from scratch and rebuild their catalogue under their new distributors, Gulf+Western. Their first record on the new label with the finger-snap logo (replacing the stack-of-records) was provided by none other than Booker T. and the MG's; it was a Caribbean-influenced number called "Soul Limbo." It was a hit right off the bat. With more hit singles following, Stax was off to a promising rebirth.Much of the earlier part of this 9-disc set that chronicles 1968-1971 sounds like a direct continuation of the first set. Though, it isn't long when the Stax sound begins to change gradually with the influences of Stax's new order of business and mass production including more outside production from the North and in places like Muscle Shoals. The changing times also affect the tone of the music as it becomes more funkier but somehow loses its down-home grit that was omnipresent in the first set. With new producers at hand and the aim for assembly-line production, the sound on this set begins to become permeated with polish and gloss. The new artists that came during this period like the Emotions and the Dramatics were saddled with this ordeal and lyrics to many songs were gravitating more towards social and domestic awareness.Nonetheless, the Stax veterans, namely Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Albert King, William Bell, Johnnie Taylor and Booker T. & the MG's still managed to keep Stax's primal grittiness intact. The Bar-Kays were reformed by the two surviving members and as a result they increased their level of funkiness. Isaac Hayes goes from Stax session musician and principal song writer and rises to stardom as one of Stax's most successful artists ("I Stand Accused" is his best work, period. The sound clip provided here on this page is awesome). The Staple Singers provide moments of inspiration and renewed hope. With the absence of Otis Redding and Sam & Dave, that initial high-power energy is sorely missing and it wasn't long when Booker T. & the MG's were drifting away from Stax. That's the gap that these swarms of new artists like the Soul Children, Margie Joseph and Ernie Hines were aiming to fill, and do great jobs in their own respect, but you'll know something is still noticably missing.At 216 tracks among 9 CD's, each containing more than 70 minutes of music and showcased in crisp, meaty stereo sound, Vol. 2 is definitely worth the listen. Though, I found that on the first box I could categorize all the songs into those that I loved/really liked and those that I could at least appreciate. On the second box, it's about the same, however there were about six tracks that I just didn't care for such as The Nightingales "I Don't Want to Be Like My Daddy", and Jeanne & the Darlings' "It's Time to Pay for the Fun", and Calvin Scott's "Shame on the Family Name." So, 6 out of 216 isn't bad, now is it?Still, being an avid Stax fan, there was much to enjoy on this second set.It's R&B; it isn't afraid to express itself and the lyrics are still down-to-earth and didn't have to be created from hard, exasperating efforts.Everything from Booker T. & the MG's, the Staple Singers, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Eddie Floyd, Albert King, the Bar-Kays, Isaac Hayes and Johnnie Taylor and many of the Soul Children's material were my favorite tracks and obviously there are too many to mention. I also enjoyed songs from renowned artists who had brief stints with Stax like John Lee Hooker, Barbara Lewis, The TSU Toronadoes, Darrell Banke, Jimmy Hughes and even Delaney & Bonnie of "Never Ending Song of Love" fame. On disc three, you'll hear MG guitarist Steve Cropper sing(!) on "Water" as he plays guitar alongside Pops Staples and Albert King. The first three discs and the last one on their own were the strongest in the set; everything spread out in between those mentioned still contained a lot of great songs and rare gems but in the midst were some weaker and uninspired numbers.Granted, Stax was in the swing of things during this time and the sound became funkier and yet still glossy making the first set (particularly the earlier parts of it) sound primitive. The new beginning was an opportunity to use the new recording equipment acquired and here that is quite relevant. Chart success, in comparison, was about the same with less than half the singles presented being able to make the charts with everything else failing to even make a dent despite the arrival of subsidiary labels like Enterprise (mainly a jazz division), Respect and We Produce.The next chapter in Stax's golden history awaits you; R&B; music was in its last golden years before disco took over. The end of those magic times came with the close of Stax records. Meanwhile, all involved in R&B; and particularly southern soul was riding high at this point. So, if the first Stax set left you starving for more, this second set should satisfy you plenty if not overwhelm you.

By 1972, Stax had proved that it could carry on and be just as strong as it was during its first golden era when Otis Redding was its principal star. The label from '68-'71, as chronicled in the second box, enjoyed a greater multitude of success, new acts, and experimented with new sounds to keep up with the changing times, both socially and musically, but it still stuck to its gritty and raw roots that made Stax what it was; it was that Southern flavor with the exposure of blues and gospel coming through strong. It was the antithesis of Motown's polish and refinement. Here, the Stax sound was laced with bass guitar, simple yet funky drum licks, oozing organ, and a tight horn section. At this point, where this third set documents, it was all that but with many different ensembles(whether they were in Detroit, Muscle Shoals, or at their own McLemore studios there in Memphis) giving their own take on that trademark Southern sound.At 10 CDs and 213 tracks, this set covers the latter-most era as Stax moves from just before its biggest triumph at its own sponsered music festival, Wattstax, to its unfortunate downfall in bankruptcy. As Stax was reaping the rewards of success in the summer of '72, Stax was placed in the distributional hands of CBS, a major player in popular music, to which hopefully Stax could acheive the once-and-for-all monumental household-name status of that of Motown. With Stax over-spending, certain people not being careful enough with money, and with CBS supposedly over-ordering, warehousing and holding back funds on Stax product, the deal went sour and Stax became racked with debts that would ultimately force them into a shutdown in late fall 1975.Despite that kind of story that went behind the scenes of these fantastic recordings, none of that seems to cloud the atmosphere of the music. The silky smooth and raw funky '70s sounds of R&B; are brought forth quite well. It is, as always with Stax, the stuff to get your groove on with!Longtime Stax veterans Eddie Floyd, William Bell, Rufus Thomas, and Johnnie Taylor still enjoy some success, particularly the latter-most mentioned with his hits like "I Believe In You" (disc 4), "Cheaper To Keep Her" (disc 5), and "I've Been Born Again" (disc 7), and "Doin' My Own Thing" (disc 1) which is a return to his roots in blues. Rufus continues his string of dance singles like "Itch and Scratch" (disc 3), "Funky Robot" (disc 4) and "Boogie Ain't Nothin' But Gettin' Down" (disc 8), William Bell providing soul-soaked ballads like "Lovin' On Borrowed Time" (disc 4), and "Getting What You Want" (disc 7), and Eddie Floyd, who in my opinion, had the most fun-sounding repertoire such as "Yum Yum Yum (I Want Some)" (disc 1, the opener), "Soul Street" (disc 8), "Baby Lay Your Head Down" (reggae-sounding, disc 5), and "I Got A Reason To Smile" (disc 9). There are too many great songs to mention, as is the case with all the artists, and it's even a shame when looking at the list of singles that failed to hit the charts, because some have loads of potential. Take the Bessie Banks cut on disc 9, "Try To Leave Me If You Can"; that is such a sumptuous performance.Other artists that slowly watched their careers at Stax dwindle down during this time is Carla Thomas (everything from her is great), the Bar-Kays (same), and Isaac Hayes (same again, check out his only vocal duet with David Porter on disc 2). Yet amidst some of the older acts seeing less and less activity in the output, many of the other artists continued to thrive along with new acts trying to get their names across. The Staple Singers are among Stax's most successful vocal groups as well as the Dramatics, the Emotions and the Soul Children along side Stax newbies Frederick Knight, Mel & Tim, Sandra Wright, Veda Brown, and Shirley Brown. Blues men Albert King and Little Milton continue to contrubute to the bluesy side of Stax while soul men and women you don't normally associate with Stax cut a few sides like Brook Benton, Inez Foxx, the Sweet Inspirations, and even fromer Motown star Kim Weston.If none of the other sets really consumed you musically and emotionally through its feeling and lyrics, this one will. The lyrics reveal the honesty and sometimes intensity of what every human being experiences. Read near the beginning of the booklet where it says "Guts"; that about sums it all up.Though this was Stax's closing years, it was more diversified than ever with its roster and with its genres of music that it branched out on. Not every single that Stax issued is here, hence the name "Stax/Volt Soul" singles. The rock group the Gentrys ("Keep On Dancing"), cut some sides with Stax, but they are not here. If that were the case, goodness knows how many more discs this one could have spawned if it covered rock, country, jazz and gospel; Rance Allen does not appear either. Not very many B-sides are included, but these are perhaps minor quibbles. This third box, like its predecessors, suits very well in telling the story of what Stax was all about. Rob Bowman's notes are very fun to read and very enlightening. Yet, every time it's still confusing as to what the root cause of what made Stax's mightiness cave in. The simple answer is that Stax became the victim of a hostile takeover, but that did not diminish the quality of the music and its soul. Enjoy the closing chapter of the story of a landmark record company that taught America that soul was in everyone.

Such golden moments in cinema history include the world-famous helicopter-shot zoom-in on Julie Andrews spinning joyfully around in the middle of an open green field, the orchestral music rising and Julie starting to sing those opening words in a closeup shot! Absolutely timeless! You know it's a classic already after the first 5 minutes with the long very played-out opening of wind-whistling, helicopter shots of mountains, valleys, lush towns below and the sweeping orchestral music. Same goes for the opening credits. Based on a true story, Julie Andrews is Maria, a young postulant that's just not cut out for convent life. She is sent to be the governess of seven children headed by their strict father Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). She re-introduces music to the Trapp household and brings forth the charm and merriment that they once knew, and works her charm on the Captain, too. As the children learn to sing, Uncle Max (Richard Haydn) finds that this is the great singing group he's been after to exploit to Salzburg, and the children, Maria and the Captain become the Von Trapp Family Singers. This wonderful, lavish story is set against the backdrop of the Nazi invasion of Austria and the Von Trapp's dodging the Nazis and escaping into Switzerland. I have first seen this film back when I was very small and loved every minute of it. Finally, I got this DVD recently and rediscovered all of its breathtaking beauty. It still hasn't grown old. I love the Spanish audio track, too, though no songs are dubbed in Spanish which isn't to speak of for the French audio track. The French female singer dubbing Julie Andrews' songs is actually kind of nice to listen to. There is also a commentary track by Robert Wise, the director with the isolated score; yes, you hear the score by itself with no talking or singing overtop of it. Good for music historians and appreciators. Everybody, no matter who they are, should see this film at least once in their lifetime for it is an all-time essential classic. Highly appealing to children as well as adults, "The Sound of Music" is one film that will always be treasured.

Debbie Reynolds brings this whole movie to life which is based onthe true story of Margaret Tobin Brown. Molly is seen as an optimistic person longing to get away from her dirt-poor existence. She heads off to Leadville, Colorado to look for a new life and finds miner John J. Brown (Harve Presnell, re-creating the Broadway role). Johnny assures her that money won't get her everything and says that she should settle for happiness.He vows that he'll "never say no" and gives her all that she's hoped for: a house of her own, a brass bed and more. After they unknowingly strike it rich, they liven up the Denver society party, learn European customs, and all the while as Johnny becomes unable to keep his promise because of Molly's self-centeredness. All the time she tried to look for fame until she had unexpectedly gained it when she survives the Titanic disaster, claims her fame in Denver and is reunited with Johnny. Filled with great tunes like "Belly Up To The Bar, Boys" which is a great and funny dance number in the Leadville saloon, "He's My Friend", and "I'll Never Say No", "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" is a great rip-roaring foot-stomper of a musical and one remarkable gem.

It must have been a real treat for the audience to whom Bill Cosby did this standup comedy concert; seeing him live and finding out it was being filmed with people shouting randomly here and there. This is unbelieveably funny; I think the most amount of time you don't laugh is maybe five minutes. The setup is simple just a color-changing background, and a chair on a stage in an auditorium as the man himself struts out onto the stage as we see at the beginning. He covers so many topics like drugs and alcohol, dentists, his personal stories from his childhood and with his own family like the chocolate cake for breakfast, "the same thing happens every night", grandparents, little Jeffrey on the plane trip who says "I was three but now I'm four years old." He makes absurd things about families sound funny but they are so true and you can actually relate to the whole thing. You can just picture every story as he tells it and it feels like you're actually experiencing it. The one about the chocolate cake for breakfast, where his wife supposedly screeched out loud: "Where did they get chocolate cake from?!!", the dentist, and brain-damaged children are the best. Bottom line: if you want to laugh real hard, and I mean that you almost bust your gut, you must see this film. It's Bill Cosby...himself.

"Pot O' Gold" is a Jimmy Stewart film I watch repeatedly and I'm glad I'm not the only one who has heard of it. This film has been released so many time on VHS, and by all never-heard-of studios. United Artists released it to theaters at the time. Why didn't MGM buy the rights to the film years after? Great story about a struggling musician trying to save his father's music store. His notrious health-food obsessed uncle tries to pull Jimmy Haskell (Stewart) into the the health-food business. He meets a beautiful lady singer (Paulette Goddard) who with her other sister sing a band which her brother Willie plays in, and her mother runs it. When Molly McCorckle (Goddard) learns that Jimmy's uncle is the notorius C.J. Haskell, she becomes upset about it. She thinks of him as a trickster, and as a result, in a radio program she announces Jimmy will give away $1000 in cash to someone. Jimmy is faced with a tough decision: how to give away the money. If he doesn't, he coul be fined and imprisoned. After many tries, he thinks up a way. He'll give it away by telephone. The winner, when they call them up, is speechless and so is his wife. Mrs. McCorckle, C.J., Jimmy, and Molly all reunite on the radio program in a triumphant-sounding finale.The sound could be better, but an excellent film to enjoy anytime. Upbeat!

When I turned on &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; it waslike I went back in time even though this movie was made way before I was born. I saw it, and it is just one of those necessities of the late '50s. It was actually like living in the late '50s when you see it. It has such an innocent and simple storyline about two bickering people sharing the same party line, but however when they first see each other, Rock Hudson gives a psuedonym and Doris Day is in another world with him. She doesn't know that it's the one who shares her party line. You want to find out the rest? Check this out and see what happens. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be saying: &quot;They sure don't make them like that anymore.&quot;

Why not? It is ranked #11 on the American Film Institue's 100 Best Movies of All Time list. This is Frank Capra's prime and best direction. It should have won all the Academy Awards itwas nominated for. George Bailey (James Stewart) is just a ordinary small town man who when he was a child he had dreams of being famous and building things and travel around the world. Through life's events he never sets foot outside of Bedford Falls. On Christmas Eve, c. 1945, he becomes depressed that he fears he has misplaced $8000 to pay off a defecit. The meanest man in town, Henry F. Potter who tried to ruin George all his life, won't help him at all. George came crawling to the wrong person. George makes an attempt at suicide, but is saved thanks to his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody A-S-2 (angel second class). He shows George who wishes he had never been born at all, what life and the town would be without him. Things are different in multiple ways. It drives George crazy, until he can't take it any longer and asks for his life back. It almost brings a tear to your eye when George is sobbing on the bridge and says "Please, God, let me live again." Bert the cop finds him and George he realizes Bert knows him, his mouth is bleeding and finds everything the way it was before, and realizes how happy he was and how many lives he touched and just about everything wouldn't be the same without him. He really did have a wonderful life! His wife and childhood friend, Mary (Donna Reed) arranges all of George's friends, quite a whole lot, to help George out. Indeed, it is true that no man is a failure who has friends. When you see this astounding, inspiring and highly admired film, you'll realize that everyone in this world has a purpose in life and matters to everyone whether they realize it or not. MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Rare indeed; I can't imagine where you would find original 45s or even LPs containing all of these songs. That would be one lifetime task. The good folks at Rhino Records with their remarkable and creative tastes took out all of that hassle for us and now offers a rather unique set of rare funky music from the vaults of Atlantic/Atco and Warner/Reprise dating 1967-1977 with 91 tracks spanning across 4 filled-to-the-brim discs. Any soul music fan will no doubt want to explore this area of the R&B category (funk and I mean pure funk), but at times the flow of the music could seem a bit too much to handle. Some of the cuts go more than 3 1/2 minutes and sound like they might not end any time soon. The other case would be some tracks sound bizarre or unusual in terms of sound due to instrumentation, arrangements, etc. Such "bizarre" tracks are the sitar-laced rendition of "Jumpin' Jack Flash", "Steppin' Stones" with a crazed flautist leading the way on a very blazing and dizzy-sounding track. The good outweigh the not-so-good remarkably, though. So get ready to hear punchy horns, infectious, simplistic and driving drumbeats, super funky bass lines, crunchy guitars, oozing organs and ultra-soulful vocals. On disc one, some noteworthy tracks are "Spreadin' Honey", "Get Otta My Life Woman", "Snatchin' It Back", "Sexy Coffee Pot" and "Help Me Make Up My Mind" (an answer to "Can I Chane My Mind"). Be sure to check out "Sookie Sookie", "Feelin' Alright" (done by Lulu (To Sir With Love)!), and "Engine Number Nine" on disc two, "Face It" (love the female backup singers on this), "Wah Wah Man", an alternate extended mix of "Rock Steady", "Suavecito", and "Nuki Suki" (from Little Richard) on disc three as well as "Moon Shadow", "Kissing My Love", "Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky", "Chug Chug-A-Lug", "Everybody Wanna Get Rich Rite Away", and "Chicken Heads" on disc four. Those were just some of my favorite tracks, so I may have missed some. Many are instrumentals, but there are a handful with vocalists singing about love, dancing, partying, social concerns, etc. Bottom line: worth checking out and worth the discovery. You definitely won't hear this stuff on commercial radio. Only about three or four songs you'll recognize; the rest is like a surprise. If you're into R&B and want to explore the funk side of it, you can't find a better pick, and about 90% of these songs aren't available (some or many) together anyplace else. The real deal of funk; that is "what it is!"

Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "sick" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: "Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it." That's the moral of the story, really."Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day.

To me, Motown is the greatest record company ever. I have never seen a record label produce so many hits in history. This is feel-good music that will keep you dancing, make you sing along, and make you want to crank the sound up. The sound is not bad at all, it is excellent. If the Hitsville U.S.A. box sets are too complex and you're just going for the basics, this is perfect for you. I love every song on here. I might have substituted Gladys Knight and the Pips' "Neither One Of Us" with their other hit "Midnight Train to Georgia." "Motown-The Classic Years" is a definitive collection of Motown hits you can't do without.

&quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; is tied with &quot;Duck Soup&quot; at being the #1 best Marx brother movie! Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) with Fiorello (Chico) and Tomasso (Harpo) try to get opera newcomer Ricardo Baroni (Alan Jones) to be the center of the New York Opera company instead of Rodolfo Lasparri. On the night debut of Lasparri in New York, Groucho makes a very funny speech before the opera starts. He concludes with, &quot;Let there be dancing in the streets, drinking in the saloons, and necking in the parlor. Play, Don.&quot; The result: one hilarious evening complete with a baseball game skit, a scenery change during the opera, Lasparri's kidnapping, and Baroni becoming the star of the opera with Rosa (Kitty Carlisle) back in the biz. Excellent Marx Brothers masterpiece!

"Amadeus" is not rated R, it's rated PG. Don't believe me? Check elsewhere. Why in the world would you put R? There is very little adult situations, little violence, and little language. Believe me movie fnas. It's rated PG. The following is an edition to this review. Now, I understand why the rating change came to be. The Director's Cut has 20 minutes of new footage which contains nudity. Why did Milos Forman decide to put a deleted dirty scene back into a great picture. Because of that the whole MPAA rating changed. If you love this movie, and you are unhappy with the new director's cut, buy the original theatrical release. I own that one and not the director's cut(Thank God). For a minute there I got scared and thought they just changed the rating for the fun of it. You'll be happier with the original. I predict a plunge in the sales of the director's cut.

Three years ago when I first saw this, I was absolutely empowered over it. The movie is very moving, touching and inspiring. I've loved classical music for years and being a young music listener, this has all the best Mozart. Tom Hulce is wonderful portraying Mozart. No one else could have done better. I must say Jeffrey Jones, who played Emperor Joseph, sounds like one of those very important businessmen. This is astounding. I feel sorry for you people who say the DVD was bad. You'll feel a lot better watching the VHS. &quot;Amadeus&quot; looks and sounds great on videotape.

"Star Time" is the perfect collection of James Brown's career-spanning musical output all in one place. Classic after classic is presented across four jam-packed discs. Might I add, most if not all are presented in their full unedited and uncut versions so for example with "Cold Sweat", you get both parts whereas some smaller collections will only give you part one. On these cuts you experience the rawness and the pure vitality of JB and his band. You get to hear some band members, notably saxophone players, improvise and James Brown talks to his band and tells them how he wants the next part of it to sound. What other band leader did that or does that? These guys showed a true sense of muscianship. Again, all the well-known classics are here as well as some songs you don't hear too often, as well as some alternate cuts like the full version of "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag", with JB saying "This is a hit" at the beginning and its presented how it was originally recorded before the tape was sped up and prepped for the 45. Cool! This is interesting, "Stoned to the Bone" on disc four might actually be "I Got A Good Thing" which came out at the same time. Whatever it is, it's funky stuff anyway, and this collection's got it. From JB's early days as a passionately bluesy pioneering artist to his get-down and get-funky years. The liner notes, essays, and the whole booklet is fantastic, and the track by track listing contains sessionographies and so much other interesting facts. So please, please, please get up offa that thing and add this amazing set to your collection. You'll be doing the popcorn, gettin' on the good foot, breakin' out in a cold sweat and doin' it to death. Ahhhhhh-ow!

In the 21st century, the symphony has now become an even more extravagant and important part of the orchestral repertoire. Such that it has expanded to cover as many different emotions and feelings possible and include an large force of performers to do such a task. Nearly three centuries ago, the symphony was merely an overture acting as a musical hors d'ouevres to the "main event of the evening." One man stood in between these two times to distinctly and radically change the importance of the classical symphony and start it in its direction for IT to become "the main event." That man was one Joseph Haydn. He was a contemporary of Mozart, and was a huge influence on the likes of Mozart as well as Beethoven, who would later take the symphony on a giant step forward. Yes, Beethoven made musical history with his Choral symphony, but who do you think helped get him there from the start?Within the depth of this monumental set is a true lifetime labor of love. It took Haydn nearly 40 years to compose more than 100 symphonies, and the listener can find it evident how Haydn bridged the gap between Baroque and Romantic through the symphony in what we know as the "Classical style." The first few symphonies reflect a lot of Baroque elements and towards the end, a fully developed Classical style with futuristic hints laced within.These are all 106 symphonies that Haydn composed during his long stay in the service of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, as well as the products of Paris and London, which are, to this day, the most praiseworthy. 104 of these symphonies are numbered and two from Haydn's earlier years, which somehow got lost in the shuffle or were discovered later, were given letters ("A" and "B"). There is also one "Sinfonia Concertante" for violin, cello, oboe and bassoon from the London years. All these performances are quite exquisite and tasteful. Adam Fischer and the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra made this a 14 year project from 1987-2001 with so much individual and global history happening during that time period. Fischer himself recalls in the booklet what took place in his life around the time of the recording of certain symphonies. There are even included photos of Fischer before and after the project. After the project, he's balder and older but happier-looking.Like Antal Dorati, the first conductor to do a complete Haydn symphony project back in the early '70s, Adam Fischer did not record these symphonies in order. These were all issued individually in separate packages over the course of the years. Now Brilliant Classics, with license from Nimbus, includes all of them in this complete package. Though it is 33 discs, one would think it's an enormous box. It's only about 6" by 6" with a depth of about 3". The CD's are enclosed in space-saving envelopes which display disc information on the back, and artistic portrayals of 18th century life on the front. A different painting (in B&W;) is on every envelope; some correspond to certain symphonies with nicknames.The nicknamed symphonies would be the ones I recommend to check out first if you feel it would be too much to go through this whole set in however much time it would take (definitely not nonstop). Just to talk about those would be way too time consuming. You really have to check it out for yourself.The orchestra performs with lots of gusto and vibrant energy that feature a melodic violin section, clucking woodwinds, razor-sharp brass, deep basses and an agressive timpanist. They truly know the Austro-Hungarian way of performing with the free use of dynamics and rubatos. All are performed on modern instruments which would be the only choice since this orchestra was hand-picked from some of the finest modern orchestras from that part of Europe. Of course if you've heard other orchestras perform some of these works before, and these tempos among other things, are slightly different, only remember that this type of classical music is subject to many different and distinct interpretations. They serve rather well for a complete project. Dorati is the only other individual complete comparison to this. The Naxos label also recently completed a Haydn symphony cycle, but not all with the same orchestra. This would be the choice hands-down as the Dorati set is very hard to get now and is more costly, and so would the individual Naxos recordings be.Haydn's music is very enjoyable and even fun at times to listen to with his light and humorous-sounding melodies as well as some of the funny-sounding things he demanded from the orchestra like violins going up and down the scales with the basses doing the same in a counterpart, bassoons jumping up and down in octaves, or wind instruments making animal-like sounds such as in #83 (The Hen). Haydn depicted sunrises (#6 "Morning"), an echo effect done by two groups of violins (#38 "Echo"), the orchestra disappearing one by one (#45 "Farewell"), violins who forgot to tune when they should have (#60 "Il Distratto"), an unexpected surprise (#94), the tick-tock of a grandfather clock, (#101), an ominous and intense drumroll (#103) as well as so many other mixtures of emotions from happy and light to dark and dramatic, playful to passionate, reflective to serene. Those interested and those who are studying music theory and the form of the classical style will no doubt have a ball in analyzing these works and listening for the musical choices that Haydn makes in order to make the music flow evenly.Often being regarded as being too predictable, Haydn was very inventive and unique in the development of the classical symphony. The earliest ones would be the ones that sound too similar, but every one is distinct in its own respect. To those studying this kind of music and have even the slightest interest in Haydn's remarkable symphonic output, this is an essential purchase. Sure it's more than 100 bucks, but music is something you keep forever if it something you are really into. That being said, one could spend $100 on something or many things and in as little as two weeks or as much as five years, it or they would be gone. So this is a lifetime investment. All of us musicians should know.In conclusion, Haydn still kicks butt in the 21st century!

This review is about this full screen single disc edition. I got it only yesterday. I love it. I've seen &quot;Shrek&quot; several times through rental and watching it on a VHS dubbed in Spanish in a Spanish class. Seeing as how that was even funny, I decided to watch in Spanish for myself through the DVD simply because it's good learning. About the film itself, viewing it for the first time makes the viewer astounded. Shrek is a not-all-that mean but loveable green ogre,the Donkey is adorable and the most comical character, Princess Fiona is absolutely gorgeous even when she becomes an ogre like Shrek, and Lord Farquaad is quite droll and persistent as the &quot;bad guy&quot; who seems to get a big head and wants to become king. Of course you might know about the &quot;I'm A Believer&quot; finale; that is the worth waiting for. The &quot;Shrek In The Swamp Karaoke Dance Party&quot; seems to pick up where the film left off originally. Thank goodness this little treat was included. It'll have you singing along and laughing! The voice talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow are perfect cast picks. Personally, nobody could've done Donkey like Eddie Murphy. Perfect! About the DVD; flawless! When the menu comes on and the fairy tale charcters are standing around and Donkey hops up and down saying &quot;Oh, pick me! Me, me, me!!&quot;, you could easily let that play forever. It's funny. There are more special features than those listed on the page. They include the filmmakers' commentary heard when you watch the movie, an HBO documentary, sketches of outtakes as the artist run through them, technical &quot;goofs&quot; (hilarious!), interviews with the characters (neat-o!) and more. The entire DVD is worth it. Wonderful music, neat scenery, and the humor of the loveable, memorable characters are such sumptious formulas. The scenery especially makes you want to be there. You'd also want to appreciate the characters and their feelings as if they were real. &quot;Shrek&quot; is such a fabulous movie for all ages. If it's not in your video library by now, what are you waiting for?

"the Rainmaker" is an exciting tale of young rookie lawyer who's fresh to the business named Rudy Baylor. His first case is defending a couple who's son is dying of lukemia, and the Great Benefit Insurance Company refuses to help them...8 time in a row they deny their claim! Rudy furiously gets on the case. Meanwhile, he's trying to help a young lady get away from her abusive husband. In the complex court case that kind of reminds me the way Tom Clancy writes, Rudy takes the insurance company down in an exciting climax. This is an excellent young adult book and at times it seems you can't put it down. However, I think the language usage leaves something to be considered. Anyway, I give this book an A+.

&quot;The Wild One&quot;, with Marlon Brando perched on top of his motorcyle on the front cover, had a certain appeal to me. Always looking for great '50s films, and '50s-related films, I gave this a try. When it came on, after the Columbia logo, it opened on a deserted highway with a title card reading &quot;This is a shocking story. It could never take place in most American towns--but it did in this one. It is a public challenge not to let it happen again.&quot; That'll grab your attention. Marlon Brando's voice is heard narrating about his expericences in the story. All of a sudden motorcycles appear roaring down the road over the opening credits. The film is basically about rebellious motorcyclistswho cause mischief in a small town and hang out at a local diner until Johnny's (Marlon Brando) rival Chino (Lee Marvin) arrives.Check this film out and see what happens. When you see that chilling title card and the film progresses, you may be puzzled wondering what will happen, for at first the rebels may appear as all bark and no bite. There's a lot of cool '50s slang, daddy-o, to look at the lighter side! The result of the film is an accident and the rebels being forced to leave town never to return again; I'll say that much. When you see the film for the first time, and are about to watch it again, you might say to the chilling title card&quot;Balderdash!&quot; Think what gangs are doing now as opposed to what they did exactly 50 years ago. Great film with excellent drama depth.

If you want to get the best and the bulk of CCR, make no other choice! You definetly, DEFINETLY need this album. There's no question in my mind that any '60s music fan should do without it! From their cover of the 1957 Dale Hawkins' tune "Susie Q", which by the way CCR's renidition is the best especially with the infectious drumbeats at the beginning, to "Someday Never Comes' which was one of their last gold singles. Every song is essential and a top-grade classic! Turn the volume up on "Up Around the Bend" to show everyone that Classic Rock is the best! This album has been certified a multi-platinum status. I don't know what the sales are, but if this album keeps selling strong here on Amazon.com, it will be, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock'n'roll albums ever! Their 11 minute renidition of "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" is the best next to Marvin Gaye's and Gladys Knight and the Pips' versions. It is a feast for the ears from a band that drove the musical audience back to good ol' American rock'n'roll! 'Tis a shame they never had a #1 hit, but they've come pretty close many times!

So what does happen after the Blues Brothers did their time dancing to the"Jailhouse Rock?" From the start this sequel starts off on a very mournful note as Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) finally gets out of prison after 18 years doing time. The world is now a very different place; brother Jake is gone, Curtis, their mentor has also passed on and the only place they called home, the beloved orphanage, has closed down. A "concerned" Mother Mary (Kathleen Freeman) with stick in hand gives Elwood the opportunity to mentor a young orphan named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant). Elwood also learns that he does have kind of a family: Curtis' illegitimate son, Cab, (Joe Morton) works nearby...but, of all things, he's a police officer. After Elwood "borrows" some money from him, he picks up the new "Bluesmobile" with Buster in tow and is off to once again reunite the Blues Brothers Band. Along the way there comes a new partner, Mighty Mack(John Goodman) but there also follow some angry Russians and an entire police force hot on their trail. This time, the ultimate destination is a battle-of-the-bands tournament hosted by the mysterious Queen Mousette (Erykah Badu) in a Louisiana swamp as they go up against some rather stiff competition which includes the likes of B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Bo Diddley, Lou Rawls, Koko Taylor, Dr. John among others.Granted, the storyline is considerably weaker in contrast to the first movie, and after some time, you feel like you're watching one big music video rather than a movie. What makes this one checking out is that first of all, the number of awesome blues/soul musicians present and how they play charcters integral to the story such as B.B. King, Aretha Franklin and James Brown (who both reprise their roles), Sam Moore (of Sam & Dave), Wilson Pickett, Eddie Floyd and of course the Blues Brothers band. All of whom are non-actors yet they do more convincing jobs at acting than some of these hack actors and actresses out there now; they don't have to try too hard yet they're still fun to watch, which is what this film is supposed to convey, I suppose.Though it started sad, the tone gradually picks up and you can't help but be absorbed by the music. With the absence of John Belushi, who brought such unbelieveable vitality to the act, of course it is not the same, justlike the saying "they sure don't make 'em like that anymore," this is proof of that: the entertainment industry saw some big downfalls especially in cinema and this one was hit pretty hard.The other weakness of this movie is how cartoonish some of the aspects of it are, such as the 1 1/2 minute police car crash (it looks funny yet just plain silly at the same time), the Bluesmobile going underwater, etc.Much of the musical numbers are modeled after those in the first movie: Aretha now sings "Respect", James Brown, this time with Sam Moore, with a full choir lead a tent revival congregation in another uplifting, fast gospel number, and the BB band once again briefly perform in the guise of a country/western outfit. The inclusions of them are fine, but the content is what the producers and choreographers seemed to get carried away with and borderline the point of absolute oddity. To my knowledge, the Razzie award people did not even nominate this film for anything, soyou know it can't be that bad.If you are a true Blues Brothers fan, there's still much to enjoy and you'll at least appreciate it if not like it a lot.

So says John Belushi's character, Joliet Jake Blues to brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) after he "sees the light". The Godafther of Soul, James Brown, plays a high-spirited reverend leading the choir and congregation on "The Old Landmark." Before all this, Jake is released early from prison, and him and Elwood visit the Penguin, Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman) at the orphange where they were raised. They learn that the Church is no longer interested in keeping the orphanage, and the only way to keep it is if $5,000 is paid. They offer to help, but she doesn't want stolen money. The other part of their "family' is Curtis (Cab Calloway) who says that they need a little "Churching up". Once they experience Reverend Cleophus is where Jake gets inspired and joins the congregation dancing to the high-spirited gospel number. Him and Elwood are going to reunite their rhythm and blues band. They start recruiting and along the way, we see them jam with legendary musicians like Aretha Franklin who tells Matt "Guitar" Murphy to "think" before he goes back out with his "hoodlum friends." Yep, she breaks into that song. Play it loud! Before that as they ride through some sort of a street fair, they catch John Lee Hooker and his band playing that hot electric blues on "Boom Boom." I'd love to see him and his band in my town jamming. It sure looked like he was having a good time. These made music the way it was supposed to be: fun! Anyway, the Blues Brothers make an I.O.U. with Ray Charles at his music exchange on an electric piano. Ray and the B.B. band fully recruited jam an shake it up on "Shake Your Tail Feather." That is one of the best musical numbers ever in this film. There are people dancing in the streets and doing dances as Ray calls them off. Listen to the driving bass line. If that doesn't have you up and moving, you've lost the rhythm. Their first gig is unappointed and is at a country bar. They start on "Gimme Some Lovin" but the crowd grows angry. So they decide to "Rawhide" and "Stand By Your Man," which calms them down, sort of. The real "Good Ole Boys" arrive later and try to get back at the Brothers. Their real gig that's going to draw in the money is at a huge 5,000-seat auditorium. Cab Calloway and the band entertain the audience with "Minnie the Moocher". Watch when the song gets faster and Calloway scat sings with audience repeating the scats. Fun and funny. The Brothers finally arrive and the band plays "I Can't Turn You Loose." Oh, yeah, watch for an audience member similing directly at the camera. Look at me! They cut loose on "Everybody Needs Someone To Love". Oh, man, hot stuff! After the "Sweet Home Chicago" number, a record deal is made and they escape without being seen but bump into Jake's furious girlfriend (Carrie Fisher) and it's back to Chicago with the money with Nazis led by Henry Gibson, and a huge police force hot on their trail. Those are what enemies these pair of Robin Hoods make on the way. Watch the car stunts in this huge chase scene and the mammoth number of policmen, SWAT and armed forces clamoring into the destational office building. UNREAL! It's only a movie and they sure went all out on this with a mountain of a budget, but it paid off at the box office. What started out as a Saturday Night Live sketch became one of the most popular movies ever. For all music lovers; this has one of the most musically diverse soundtracks from blues to gospel to soul to R&B to latin to rock to country and even classical. Look out for the falling Pinto! Most memorable for the music. They made it fun and you'll be smiling and dancing through the musical numbers. Electrifying! "I need you, you, you..."

I didn't see nothing wrong with this film. Anything that is Marx Brothers to me, I know there is going to be laugh after laugh. There are plenty of hilarious gags in this film. The writing isn't too bad. It actually makes some sense. Forget what major film buffs may say. This is one of those &quot;just-for-laughs&quot; films. Though it's true when they were working for Louis B. Mayer, he wouldn't let the trio try out some of their gags and jokes, so that the critics could decide what worked best, but don't let that stop you from watching this. The trio help a circus owner stay in business by taking it to his aunt played by the very funny Margaret Dumont. It's terrible that she only entered more than halfway through the film. It;s worth the wait though. The grand finale circus scene is incredible with a chase by a gorilla, Margaret Dumon't character fired out of a cannon and joining a whole group swinging like trapeze artists. It'll bowl you over.

Elvis is the only person that keeps this movie alive. It's not one of his best, but it's still entertaining. All Elvis movies are nice to watch simply because of Elvis. Without him, there's no picture. Elvis really cuts loose in the fight scenes, and really shows how tough and strong he is. I always enjoy watching these fight scenes. Don't knock "Stay Away Joe", people. It's not one his best films, but it's still pretty cool to watch.

After making movies in Hollywood during the '60s, Elvis returned to being the Undisputed King of Rock And Roll! This album was Elvis' best since &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;. The 1969 sessions were rockin' and Elvis was glad to quit Hollywood, and go back to live performances and leisurely recording! You'll absolutely love this! With extra tracks added this is even better ever since this album was first released over 30 years ago.

"My Fair Lady" is one of the American Film Institute's 100 Best Movies of All Time. It ranks at #91 (should have been higher). It is the classic story of Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), the Cockney-accented flower girl selling on the streets at Covent Garden, who'd rather be selling in the shops.Professor Henry Higgins, played by Rex Harrison who won an Oscar for his performance in this picture, discovers her and her awful speaking skills and appearance, and boasts to her how he can make a duchess out of her. When she's taken in, it is a long drag trying to teach her how to speak correctly. When the time comes, the musical number in there is jubilant. The next day at the Ascot races, which features some of the most marvelous costumes ever, she makes her debut in the most famous outfit she wears in the film next to the ball gown. During the races when the horses pass, she hilariously shouts: "Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' 'arse'!" It becomes a shocker to everyone. Preparing for the embassy ball, and during so, the setting is spectacular! Feeling uncredited after the ball, she runs off to Covent Garden where no one recognizes her at all, and her father (Stanley Holloway) is "getting married in the morning". Eliza goes to Henry's mother's place as Higgins desparately searches for her in a big mass confrontation between the two, as she thinks she can do without him as she goes away. Henry marches home angry in a quite odd musical number how he can do without her, but he's "grown accustomed to her face." As he plays her voice on the gramophone, Eliza comes in and talks in her Cockney voice saying "I washed my face and 'ands before I come, I did." Higgings looks up saying: "Eliza? Where the devil are my slippers?". The scene ends ther showing that she will stay with Higgins! Simply marvelous and "loverly" is "My Fair Lady"!

&quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; was one of the oldest musical films I first saw, and I'm glad one of them was this. I first saw it when I was 6 and watched dozens of times since. If you have to pick one single MGM musical, let it be this one. You won't regret it at all, and it is far beyond execellently made! Neatly crafted scenery, great songs and score, super-star cast, great storyline which is like a parody storyline that shows you the days of the first talking pictures and every studio's difficulty with that new technology since this film is set then. The whole movie is very colorful, and the two best secnes in the picture are probably in full agreement with every other amatuer and advanced movie review. They are: Gene Kelly walking down a street lit with streetlights in the pouring rain, not having a care singing the title song, and doing a classic song-and-dance routine that is matched at #1 on my list with the end dancing sequence in &quot;An American In Paris&quot;. The other best scene in &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; is the extravagant, exuberant, spectacular &quot;Broadway Melody&quot;. Full of nothing but music, music, MUSIC throughout with a lot of great songs sung by Gene Kelly and extras throughout. That sequence itself has a little story built on to the plot of &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; itself making it complex. There are many adjectives to describe this picture. I have 8: excellent, exuberant, joyful, carefree, spectacular, smashing, perfect, and fabulous! &quot;Gotta dance!&quot;

"Rebel Without A Cause" is a true landmark film. James Dean should have gotten the Academy Award for this film and not for "East of Eden". Although I think "East of Eden" is as equally as good as "Rebel Without A Cause". It's the story of a discontented teenager who doesn't fit in in the new neighboorhood, and who always finds himself in trouble, and doesn't know why. His troubles all stem from a lack of communication with his folks. He finally finds himself friends with Plato and Judy, but still becomes involved when a leather-jacket clad gang comes after Plato, in which he is eventually shot in the end. Truly what James Dean was all about. You can imagine the impact it had on its audiences when this film was released, which was just about a month after the car accident that took James' life. James Dean will always be remembered as agifted and true actor.

This &quot;2nd To None&quot; album is way over the top. It is such a fantastic follow-up to last year's phenomenal &quot;ELV1S 30 #1 Hits&quot;.&quot;2nd To None&quot; has it all. All fo the songs are remastered and has the same sound technology like on &quot;30 #1 Hits&quot;. It blew me away especially on songs like &quot;A Mess Of Blues&quot;, &quot;Little Sister&quot;,and &quot;An American Trilogy&quot;. Even the '50s selections like last time sound stereo enhanced but are the same original recordings.The previously unreleased recording of &quot;I'm A Roustabout&quot; is something to lend an ear to. The remix of &quot;Rubberneckin'&quot;: WOW! WOW! WOW! &quot;2nd To None&quot;, I predict, will be another big winner. Maybe even bigger! There is no question about it. Quintessential and definetly recommended!

Highly entertaining! Don Knotts gives his best performance in this picture. Kind of funny with the mix of animation and live action in a non-Disney film. With the animation, the singers, it's so lovely. I enjoy every second of this film. Too the people who highly dislike this movie, you're missing out on it. You don't have to be a child to enjoy it. &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; is the finest non-Disney animation/live action film.Too bad this was one of the last films to be made before the Warner Animation Department in Burbank shut down.

&quot;October Sky&quot; is an inspirational story of a young high school student who tries to escape life below the ground in a coal-mining town in West Virginia. Seeing the Russian satellite &quot;Sputnik&quot; move across the sky one night, he's inspired to build rockets and create a dream and passion for himself. He, with the help of his three other friends, they launch rocket after rocket after so many unsucessful tries. Quinten, the brains of the group, figures out the sucess of the launch of these rockets. The publicity kicks in afterwards as the rockets being launched amaze the town people, and Homer goes on to Indianapolis to win the science fair and meet Dr. Werhner von Braun. Really touching when Homer's father realizes Homer's dream and launch the final rocket which is dubbed &quot;Miss Riley&quot; after their inspirational teacher. Amazement strikes the townspeople as they watch this rocket go high in the air.

A truly touching story and one you'll treasure forever! Great rock'n'roll music as well, too!

"North To Alaska" caught my attention when I first heard the title song by Johnny Horton. I decided to watch this film, considering I like John Wayne and his movies. There's a lot of what anyone who enjoys a western comedy; John Wayne, of course, a humorous good-natured storyline, funny antics, and fisticuffs. There aren't many gunfights, just fistfights, with sucker punches here and there. Wayne is Sam McCord and is sent by his partner George Pratt (Stewart Granger) to Seattle to bring back his love, Jenny. However, she has married someone else. Sticking around Seattle, he finds a dance hall girl named "Angel", played by French model-actress Capucine. Can George accept her in place of Jenny? Find out for yourself. If you're a John Wayne fan, it's a must!

"Big" is one of the best films that Tom Hanks, but I can't place over "Forrest Gump", but it comes pretty darn close. The story of Josh Baskin, an 11 year-old who wishes he was "big" at a carnival. He wakes up next morning and discovers that he's now older (30 years old). He can't do nothing about it when he freaks his mother out. His best friend, Billy (Jared Rushton)who becomes freaked out, too, at first, until he tries to help him, as he finds Josh a job at a toy company. He soon falls for co-worker Elizabeth Perkins. However as time goes by, Josh becomes unhappy and wants to be a boy again. This something you must see if you really enjoy Tom Hanks, who in my opinion is the best modern-day actor.

&quot;Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines&quot; is another one of those long near-epic length films of the 1960's. (Don't you just love it?) All of the world's greatest aviators including Stuart Whitman, Gert Frobe, and Terry-Thomas are to meet in London and prepare themselves for a London to Paris air race. The result: hilarity and wackiness all leading in to one giant misadventure that will have you in stitches. By the way, when the German aviator is marching with his soldiers he imitates a brass oompah band! Hysterical sounding! Check this one out. Satisfaction guaranteed!

James Dean's final film became a landmark in motion picture history. It's very hard watching this film nonstop. Anyone who passes this film up is no film critic. Everything about &quot;Giant&quot; is superb and marvelous. James Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor go through three generations in Texas. It's amazing going through the times as they each grow older. The restaraunt scene, where Rock Hudson gets beaten up and knocked around by the owner is unforgettable. It shocked me when Hudson lost the fight, landed in the salad, and the owner throwing a sign on him saying&quot;We have the right to refuse service to anyone.&quot; &quot;Giant&quot; is absolutely marvelous and heartwarming entertainment.

&quot;Prancer&quot; is the story of young Jessica (Rebecca Harrell) who truly believes in heaven and in Santa Claus. After a wooden reindeer falls from above the street after Santa's wooden sleigh and wooden reindeer are hung above the street, the reindeer is Prancer. There is a gap where Prancer used to be. Jessica later finds a reindeer in the woods, and she realizes it is the real Prancer. She tries to nurse it back to health after he's injured despite what her father (Sam Elliot) thinks. Later the whole town hears about it. After she's involved in an accident while trying to free Prancer after being put into captivity when her father sells him, the whole townspeople from the gruff veterinarian (Abe Vigoda), to a lonely aging bright red-haired neighbor (Cloris Leachman) give a party for her. Her father understands then, and they take Prancer up to Antler Ridge for Santa to come and get him. This is a perfect film for everyone to enjoy around the holidays.

The best example of Elvis' pre-Army Hollywood recordings. Watch the movie first, then listen to this explosive soundtrack. Good thing RCA again re-issued old albums and added more tracks to them. The original #1 gold album had 12 (not long enough), and now the re-issue has 20 (better!). &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; gets the soundtrack started. One that one, Elvis really pours it all on. If you love Elvis, I highly recommend it. If your a fan of his movies and the music in it, it is definetly essential.

This is another one I watch the night before Thanksgiving. A real special treat taht should be aired, but NO. All they air nowadays is stupid Japanese cartoons and such. Do yourself a favor if you enjoy real cartoons. This is a great one that finds Daffy in Hollywood on bended knees to try to get a Hollywood producer or director to let him do "Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th 1/2 Century." It's a great sequel that has an unlikely ending. Enjoy this along with a stuffed turkey.

&quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; can be easily called &quot;The Lou Gehrig Story&quot;. I've always enjoyed baseball, and love watching movies about it, too. This has always been one of my top picks. Babe Ruth himself is a cast member in this picture. Where else can you see him personally in a film. This is probably the only one. You'll enjoy watching this Oscar-nominated classic about a true baseball legend struck down by a tragic illness. Lou Gehrig will always be one of the best baseball players of all time next to Babe Ruth.

&quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; kicks this one off. The best on the whole album and the longest. 4 and a half minutes, thank you! &quot;Burning Love&quot; is high-energetic, and so is &quot;Way Down&quot;, &quot;Moody Blue&quot;, &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot;, and that touching &quot;In The Ghetto&quot;. Fantastic that this went from 10 songs to 16. But why stop at 16? The second volume originally had 10 and now it has 20. This one could have had 20. Either way you want to look at it, it's still an absolute must! My hopes are with that music fan from Rome, NY that maybe someday there'll be a Volume 6. That's a great idea because &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;T-R-O-U-B-LE&quot;, and &quot;Always On My Mind&quot; are missing. Maybe there'll be Volume 6. RCA has got to do that. Anyway, the fifth volume is superb, and Elvis can still rock the house!

To any Elvis fan out there you know this is a must-have.Nobody was or is ever as good as Elvis Presley. From Elvis' first record &quot;That's All Right&quot; in 1954, to Elvis' golden record &quot;For The Heart&quot; in 1976. This collection is absolutely fantastic. There's not a bad song on here! This is the best RCA/BMG has ever done! Elvis Presley is a man we'll never forget, and this collection says it all!

So who really first sang those words "I heard the news/There's good rockin' tonight"? Not Elvis. It was one of his many influences: Mr. Blues himself, the great Wynonie Harris. Collectables, a big oldies reissue company like Rhino Records, has done an excellent job with this, perhaps the best single-disc set of Wynonie Harris. 25 great platters from his King years (the cream of the crop in his recorded material) are presented in an amiable sound quality lasting over an hour. Highlights of this disc include the title track, "All She Wants To Do Is Rock", "Sittin' On It All The Time", "Rock Mr. Blues", "Oh Babe", "Lovin' Machine", and a "Lawdy Miss Clawdy"-sounding number called "Christina." All of them are mid-tempo or fast songs and have that good ol' boogie-woogie beat and swing feel that you can dance to. Crank the volume way up and people will think you have a party right in your home when they hear the thumping bass, the driving drums, the wailing horns, and Wynonie's raucous vocals along with the sharp responses of the backing vocalisits. These are great examples of what early R&B music was in America when late-night listeners were discovering tunes like these during the few years following World War II. The jump blues formula, evident in all of these songs, was one of the key elements for forming what they called "rock'n'roll". King Records was one of the most prominent indie labels in the late '40s and throughout the '50s along with Atlantic and Chess; Wynonie Harris played an important role in helping to create the early R&B sound that would catch on. This is absoultely worth listening to and checking out. By the way, if you look at the album cover while listening to the music, especially the fast songs, try not to laugh. Smiling is contagious. You know he must have had some fun making this music, and you'll have fun discovering it.

"A Shot In The Dark" finds Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau on the case of a murder at the Chateau. Maria Gambrelli (Elke Sommer), a resider, is accused. Clouseau has fallen in love with her and is willing to free her of any charge by watching her every move and masquerading, which finds him going to the police station 4 times in a repeated paddy wagon sequence which is absolutely the cream of it all. Streaking through a nudist colony is another great sequence that is a quite a shocker on film. When the climax is about to occur, Clouseau questions a group of bickering people who've comitted dirty sinful deeds, plus Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is out to eliminate Clouseau. He did, of course, fail to do so. The outcome is surprising. You'll have to see for yourself. It's not better than "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" as it is called by many the best. It comes close, though. This is the only Pink Panther movie that does not have the Pink Panther in the title and the theme song in the movie, but is definetly worth seeing. There's no question about it. You'll laugh so hard you'll fall. Don't fall to hard, otherwise you'll receive a "bemp" on the head!

A sort of repeat of "Blue Hawaii", but "Paradise, Hawaiian Style" shows more exotic locations. Only this time around Elvis takes you by air. He stars as a handsome unemployed helicopter pilot who decides to open his own helicopter tourist service with his partner. Along the way, Elvis can't keep several beautiful wahinis out of his hair. "Is this any way to run an airline?" You bet! With one look at this movie, you'll see it's not called "Paradise, Hawaiian Style" for nothing. The young child costar Donna Butterworth was a huge Elvis fan before she starred in this picture with Elvis. Why not? A little girl who loved Elvis to death and now she's doing a motion picture with him in person. You could call it a dream come true. Elvis fans, don't delay.

&quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot; is a likeable in some sense. Elvis is a Navy frogman who's on a search for buried treasure hidden in a sunken ship under the sea. He finds it's linked to Dodie Marshall and with her help he tries to find it. But, there are some unwelcome searchers looking for it too. One of them being the enticing Pat Preist of &quot;Munsters&quot; fame. When the treasure is found, it's all in copper. But, they're able to get some money out of it. A good thousand or so dollars. Elvis' characters were never money hungry. This film has got all the '60s fads and fashions: yoga crazes, body painting, spaghetti/body art, swinging dance moves, swinging music, and a wheel full of girls called &quot;The Love Machine&quot;. That one's a great movie song that's often looked down upon. It's so '60s themed like the Bond movie &quot;Casino Royale&quot; is. Take about 95 minutes out of your life and see this swinging flick.

I wonder if Elvis enjoyed doing &quot;Girls! Girls! Girls!&quot; because of Hawaii, where it was filmed, or becuase of all the gorgeous girls. This is a simple kind of film that's sort of lost its popularity over the years. &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; has taken over. Elvis is a struggling fishing boat business owner who tries to hang on to a boat that belonged to his father. Good girl Laurel Goodwin tries to buy the boat back to Elvis. Meanwhile, Stella Stevens tries to make her move, but to no avail. I don't why she has to sing three songs in Elvis' movie. After all, the central character is him. But he wasn't greedy, and it didn't matter to him. Elvis fans, take the time out to see what Elvis loved the most.

"Fun In Acapulco" might look like it on-screen, but it wasn't fun in Acapulco for Elvis or Ursula Andress. Both of them were learning new languages. Ursula Andress was just learning English (reason for her voiced being dubbed in "Dr. No"), and Elvis had to learn Spanish because some of the songs he sang have Spanish lyrics. So it was hard work for them. You have to hear Elvis sing in Spanish. It's so different. Here, he plays a former circus performer who comes to Acapulco to get away from his past. He's hired as a lifeguard at a hotel, and sings for the guests at night. Being a lifeguard wasn't easy, because when he was in the circus, he was in the acrobats. On one swing he missed his partner who fell to the ground and resulted in a terrible accident. When a rival lifeguard learns about it, he challenges him to dive again since now Elvis' character is afraid of heights. He's finally able to gain back his courage, beats up the rival Alejandro Rey in a great fight scene, and climbs to the highest clif and makes the highest dive. He wins the heart of Ursula Andress, too. Great latin rhythm, latin love, and latin themed Elvis flick.

One typical '60s music fan would think that a group like the Box Tops would put out a lot of good songs, many of which were minor hits, but I'm telling you, all of these songs make you feel terrific all over. From the short-lasting #1 song &quot;The Letter&quot;, which was the band's trademark song and you can see why is because it is on every '60s music collection, to their 1970 single &quot;You Keep Tightening Up On Me.&quot; &quot;Neon Rainbow&quot; is one song that will most likely stick in your head with is catchy lyrics and teh way the instruments are played and especially young Alex Chilton's rough, gravelly and one of the most famous voices of '60s music. I also enjoyed &quot;Fields of Clover&quot; with its psychadelic-sounding G-note on the organ at the beginning and the jumpy beat throughout. &quot;Choo Choo Train&quot; is one marvelous classic that will have you dancing within no time. &quot;I Met Her In Church&quot; is another great one that will have you shouting &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; soon. &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, the title track of this album, is delightful and upbeat! Your '60s collection isn't complete without this great Box Tops compilation that provides a small sample of what the era was all about...from a great-sounding group that could have been around longer.

&quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot; is among the funniest and silliest. Peter Sellers as Clouseau does some of the most craziest things. Getting his bag stuck in the revolving door, ang going all aorund trying to get it when it's finally in the next opening and he reaches over trying to get it and gets stuck in-between the doors! Go ahead and enjoy this one, even though MGM/UA decided not to release this one.

So it says on the back of the album cover. It's no lie; this CD is hot!! Talk about funky! I think Rufus gave James Brown a run for his money some times. Here you get 18 of his funkiest and finest. From the title track which sounds like it will never end, (and why should it?) to classics like "Itch and Scratch" and "Sophisticated Sissy." On some of these that have dance names in the title, they all kind of sound the same. Rufus announces he's back with a new dance for everyone, says what it is and how to do it. Those are "Do The Funky Penguin", "Do The Push and Pull", and "Funky Robot" among others. It's pretty cool; even if you don't know how to do these dances, just do something that makes sense. These songs definitely have such colossal grooves to them. Bass lines and drum riffs are sweet!The CD has inlay liner notes about Rufus' biographical info and his involovement with Stax and the songs presentes. So check Rufus Thomas out. He was middle-aged when he did all these songs, but that made no difference. He still could make life a dance party and that's what this CD is all about: a dance party!As he said, "I ain't gettin' older; I'm gettin' better."

"Live A Little, Love A Little" is as close to '60s themed as it can get. This picture finds Elvis juggling between two magzine photographer jobs, and it looks sort of compliacted. He takes his leisure time out especially later for girls and Michele Cary. This film is a little cautionary to younger viewers. "Live A Little, Love A Little" focuses more on sex and tries to keep up with the ever-changing times. "Live A Little, Love A Little" features the low "Edge Of Reality" sequence which is very psychadelic in a sense, and "A Little Less Conversation" which became a hit this summer. By the way, pick up "ELV1S 30 #1 Hits", too. Suprising, this film can be enjoyable in some ways.

"Harum Scarum" is considered, by popular opinion to be Elvis' worst film. Don't try to restrain yourself yet. Watch it once, and see what you think. Elvis is an actor who is sent to Arabia and captured. He is trying to be put into the situation to kill the Arabian king. Elvis romances Mary Ann Mobley and turns against his captors and saves the king. Lot of action. Looks like a big budget film, but it's not. Sam Katzman, who had a reputation in Hollywood for producing films on very short schedules and given the nickname "king of the quickies", borrowed most of the costumes and sets from previously made films that were in the can. The schedule was only 18 days of shooting. Sounds corny, cheap, and cheesy, but that's what pop stars had to deal with in films they didn't like. Pop stars got the poorest film treatment. Again it is not Elvis' best film, but try it. If you don't like it, forget it.

"The Revenge of the Pink Panther" was the last Pink Panther film to star Peter Sellers, but I got the most laughs out of this one. The salty sea dog costume and inflatable parrot is extremely hilarious. "Naughty birdin afraid of the feug.", he replies. At his fake funeral, Clouseau dsguises himself as a priest, when he goes to the gathering at the churchyard, there is a 21-gun salute. When the rifles go off, he goes, "Ehh". Quite a bit of violence in this one, too. You want to laugh, go ahead and treat yourself to great comedy with this funny-bone tickler!

"The Trouble With Girls" brings on a big change of pace for Elvis as he plays the manager of a tent show who has a lot of trouble coming his way. Mainly when the local pharmacist played by Dabney Coleman is murdered, and efforts are made to track the killer down. Sounds like a mystery. Elvis finally solves the mystery and has caught the crook who definetly needed to sober up. You want to see something pecaueful in this picture is, where Marlyn Mason finds Elvis in a close-up shot playing the piano and singing "Almost", as the tent show Chautauqua is about to pull out of town. This is not a cheap film. There were over 400 extras used, lots of special effects, and lots of costumes. By the way, what the heck is Marlyn Mason saying to Elvis when the firecrackers go off? It didn't sound pleasent. In a unique film, due to Elvis only showing up in only half the picture, Elvis looks good in the sleek white suit. I'm going to get me one of those.

&quot;Mrs. Santa Claus&quot; is a holiday musical delight that features Angela Lansbury (who else?) in the title role. In an attempt to try to imitate musicals of the '40s and '50s, Mrs. Santa Claus takes a spin with the sleigh and reindeer to test her new route Santa (Charles Durning). She becomes stranded in New York City after Cupid is injured. She then becomes entranced and enchanted as she is now part of the world of Avenue &quot;A&quot;. In New York, she becomes a sort of a governess at Tavish Toy Factory, where Tavish uses children for his toymakers. Why? It's like they're his slaves. She desparately tries to stop tavish in his tracks, and not have the children work in such conditions. At a Christmas party on Christmas Eve, Cupid is finally healed, because back home Santa, Arvo, the head elf (Michael Jeter) wonder and are worried about where she is at. Will she make it back in time? I'll let you in on a little secret...she does!! Then, Santa takes her this year on his annual trip! Kids will probably enjoy this one a lot!

So utters easygoing Ryan O'Neal in this hilarious romp about one zany mix-up after another called "What's Up, Doc?". Barbra Streisand, at her most comical, intervenes in the lives of young couple, O'Neal and Madeline Kahn, helping O'Neal obtain his sought-after grant from a society of musicologists. He's Howard Bannister, but Judy (Streisand) affectionately calls him Steve, and he's determined not to let her interfere with him and his fiancee Eunice (Khan), whose name, by the way, is said 89 times in this movie, (I actually counted; it's so funny.) True, it's like a name you don't hear everyday, but you sure do here. Howard comes at a close second, Judy's name is said less than 10. So, as these characters check into the hotel, they, plus a wealthy woman and a man carrying top-secret government related material all carry overnight bags looking exactly alike. Hilarious mixups occur, plus unbelievable gags and jokes, plus a huge chase scene around San Francisco in which all end up facing a hilarously, weary judge in this unforgettable take on classic screwball comedies. You're sure to enjoy it, for you won't stop laughing with Barbra and Ryan.

First off, let me say that for the movie I rate it 5 stars and this, the MGM DVD from 2003 (not the Special Edition), 4 stars.Reason being is because this is an all-time essential classicand it needed to be presented in its original widescreen format. The sound quality is excellent though, rendered in 5.1. There are also no special features other than Spanish and French audio tracks. This release was all I could afford but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. This Romeo and Juliet story finds the Montagues and Capulets as the Jets and the Sharks, two feuding street gangs in 1950s New York. Jets leader Tony (Richard Beymer) becomes involved in an ill-fated love affair with Maria (Natalie Wood), the sister of Sharks Leader, Bernardo (George Chakiris). As their love blossoms, tensions rise and a rumble occurs with the gangs. Still, Tony and Maria hold on to each other by whatever means and risk everything, even death. All the while it is set to the magnificent score of Leonard Bernstein and choreography of Jerome Robbins. Filled with unforgettable songs like "Something's Coming", "Maria", "America" and "Tonight", "West Side Story" will keep your anticipation high, keep you glued to your chair, and steal your heart.

I am quite intrigued at the popularity that &quot;McLintock!&quot; still has among John Wayne fans and everyone else, in general. This is a very funny story with the Duke and Maureen O'Hara as a bickering couple in a &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; story set in the good ol' west. It's one of John Wayne's more comical and lighter-toned films. I have the DVD version of this film, and I have the same opinion like the rest of you; it's quite a sloppy job. Some of the film looks all right; it's nice and sharp at times. You can tell the film is very dated and at times the image becomes blurry and distorted. I can't understand what's been done to such a good film. There have been so many complaints about this inferior release. Something needs to be done. A major movie studio should try to purchase the rights to this film and give &quot;McLintock!&quot; top feeding. Think of how this would sound. Double sided disc A: 2:35:1 Widescreen and B: 1:33:1 Standard: Modified to fit screen (but better pan and scan). Picture quality could have sharp clean frames, vibrant, true-to-life eye-popping colors making you want to be there. Audio: (1) English Dolby Digital Remixed and Remastered 5.1 Stereo Surround (2) English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo (could be commentary) (3) Spanish (4) French (5) German. Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Dutch, Chinese, Thai.You could have it loaded with special features. How's that sound for a top notch DVD? Someday, that could happen. For now, we're stuck with this mediocre DVD release. An enjoyable film it is, still.

I've seen this for the second time last night. It is unbelievable funny at what Peter Sellers' Jacques Clouseau does as he is so hysterically clumsy as he gathers up all the clues to try to put the mark on the notorious phantom whom David Niven is suspected. In the courtroom sequence, a hilarious event occurs and it is too good to spoil. You must see it for yourself.I've seen every Pink Panther movie Peter Sellers was in, and this one may be ranked as a top hit, if not above &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; which is a must! Both of these are! If you want to see how Clouseau's Pink Panther search gets started, start here! Get ready to laugh out loud, too!

"Double Trouble" took advantage of the spy themes in the '60s. Elvis does his martial art moves in this picture. Unfortunately, his fighting opponent falls down a boarded-up well and...well, enough said. Annette Day tries to put her move on Elvis. He's a little resistent at first, but eventually gives in. A lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of music is what is made up of "Double Trouble". Whoever said that they were the only one enjoying this picture was wrong. You're not alone. I am a true and huge Elvis fan. I love all of his movies, no matter what they stuck him in. "Double Trouble" is double fun.

Don't ever try to restrain yourself from seeing &quot;The Sandlot&quot;. It's a must-see, feel-good, family classic that I can hardly believe it was made nearly 10 years ago. Kids, baseball fans, teenagers, adults, and everyone will love it. Hercules the Mastiff, nicknamed &quot;The Beast&quot;, is so adorable and cute. I can hardly believe those boys though that dog was some kind of a monster. Great adventure of nine friends who experience one baseball mishap and a personal run-in with The Beast at &quot;The Sandlot&quot;.

"King Creole" is right up there with "Jailhouse Rock" and "Loving You". The director, Michael Curtiz, was reluctant at first to do this picture. He thought Elvis wasn't going to obey him and be rebellious. He, of course, was wrong, and Elvis was there at Curtiz' every command. Curtiz later thought that Elvis really was going to make it in Hollywood. Neatly crafted story originally intended for James Dean. This picture was saved even though James Dean died. The story was based on the novel "A Stone for Danny Fisher". If you're an Elvis fan, I highly recommend "King Creole." You'll love it!

&quot;Roustabout&quot; has Elvis playing a karate-chopping, drifting motorcyclist who is picked up after an accident involving him being knocked off his bike by local carnival foreman Leif Erikson, with his daughter Joan Freeman and owner Barbara Stanwyck. After his bike and guitar are damaged, he is hired by Stanwyck to work as a roustabout in her carnival. Elvis, of course, soon falls for Joan Freeman who is a little reluctant at first. Over time the carnival becomes the local night spot around as Elvis attracts people for singing along the midway. In come the teenagers and crowds in droves. Rival carnivla owner Pat Buttram asks if Elvis is interested in joining his big carnival. He refuses. After some confrontation involving a stolen wallet Erikson is convicted of and Joan Freeman's unhappiness with Elvis, he quits Stanwyck's outfit. Then it's off to the Carver show. Elvis is a hit. Back at the other carnival, business is failing and troubles with the bank build. Joan Freeman tries to bring him back, but to no avail at first. Later Elvis decides to go back, pay off the debt, win Joan Freeman, and make the carnival a swinging place again. Quintessential!

Percy Sledge has one of the most chilling, passionate and beautiful voices in all of soul music. It took the right group of musicians to help emphasize that. Who better to fit the bill than the Muscle Shoals outfit?The right combination for some awesome, heartfelt deep soul.DBK Works has done a fine job in reissuing these classic albums on CD complete with original album liner notes, producer, songwriter and musician credits, as well as some new liner notes and biographies. The sound quality is as crisp as can be; every voice and instrument is audible and the balance is incredibly set. These are Percy's third and fourth Atlantic albums. First is "The Percy Sledge Way" which features 11 cover versions of classic soul tunes. One of the very best is the rendition of Sam Cooke's "You Send Me". The bass guitar and the organ just make that song happen. Absolutely sensual in every sense. "Tell It Like It Is", "Pledging My Love", "My Special Prayer", and "Just Out of Reach" (a top 70 record in '67) are the most noteworthy of those tracks. Tracks 12-23 are "Take Time To Know Her". The title cut was Percy Sledge's second biggest hit behind "When A Man Loves A Woman". "Take Time To Know Her" will just send chills down your back with its eerily passionate organ notes, and equally passionate and smoldering backing vocals who did a fair share of backup on this and the previous album. On this album, Percy features new material like "Cover Me", "It's All Wrong But It's Alright", and "Sudden Stop". He does some knock-out cover versions of the Fleetwoods' "Come Softly To Me" in a misty-sounding falsetto, and the Classic IV's "Spooky." Spooner Oldham does some great things again with the organ on the latter including the high downward chromatic run at words like "you stop and say...alright." Not all are slow; two such up-tempo numbers are "Baby Help Me" and "I Love Everything About You."As you can probably tell, the backing musicians did so much to augment Percy's wonderful voice. Roger Hawkins' drumming, simplistic as it seems, feels so tight locking in with David Hood's bass lines and punctuating saxes and horns.2 classic albums of deep soul on one disc featuring the amazing Percy Sledge...sweet deal. Perfect for a romantic evening.

&quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; is based on the old song about two lovers where Johnny is on a losing streak and decides he can change his luck with Nellie Bly. A jealous Frankie shoots her man because &quot;he was doin' her wrong&quot;. This movie is sort of based on the song. Everything is true except the shooting part in the end, but it comes very close to actually happening. &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; is quite enjoyable no matter how &quot;obscure&quot; you people might find it. It's a real top-notch and every Elvis fan must see it. By the way, we need more reviews on Elvis' movies and music please.

Released in 1968, this set chronicled the golden era of the Drifters (1959-1964). This starts right off with the sound of the "new" Drifters with Ben E. King on lead: "There Goes My Baby"; timeless classic. Next "If You Cry" and "Dance With Me" a double-sided hit; both very nice, nice songs. I dig the string arrangements. The hits continue with "This Magic Moment" and"Save The Last Dance For Me." "I Count The Tears" is one I always liked because of the "na-na-na-na-na late at night", and that's right; the Grass Roots copied that for "Let's Live For Today." Uh-uh. "Some Kind Of Wonderful" is some kind of gem; it hardly gets any attention. "Up On The Roof" and "On Broadway" feature Rudy Lewis on vocal and are ageless songs. "Under The Boardwalk" and the answer to it, "I've Got Sand In My Shoes" are really crafty and neat songs as well as "Saturday Night At The Movies" which I loved ever since I first heard it. Those three feature Johnny Moore. The Drifters were one of Atlantic Records best-selling groups and their songs are absolutely timeless and ageless never seeming to grow old. They sort of transport you to another place where you can escape the outside world. The Rhino compilation is the best alternative for this one because of track number and sound quality. Yes, this one is pretty short but the sound is quite good actually and a lot of songs are in stereo. If you're an original album collector liking to collect CD versions of old LPs, this is a definitive set.

Boy, they weren't kidding when Atlantic issued this album originally back in '68. It was a surefire winner from the start.Her third album with Atlantic proved that her talent and gospel vocal style could not be ignored. "Chain of Fools" does good for the opener. She then cuts out on James Brown's "Money Won't Change You" with raw vitality, then on the churchy "People Get Reday". She takes this Impressions' classic and blows the roof off with a great improvisatory gospel vocal spot. Have to listen to see what I mean. "Niki Hoeky" is indeed catchy; good bass guitar line, too. Then we have the classics "Natural Woman" and "Since You've Been Gone." Listen to that one; it sounds like she sings "cinnamon gum" every time she sings the title. "Good To Me As I Am To You" is a bluesy line with Aretha telling it like it is with Eric Clapton doing a good guitar feature. Then she cuts out on Ray Charles' "Come Back" and peps that one up, and does quite well with the Rascals' "Groovin'". Finally, we close with "Ain't No Way"; my personal favorite on the whole album. What a milestone of a song especially with the high wailing soprano in the background which I believe is Cissy Houston. Man, oh, man, that IS soul. Bonus material includes the unedited, longer version of "Chain of Fools", which is longer by about 2 more minutes. It has a 1 minute intro, an added verse, the lyrics as you're used to hearing them are placed differently.Again, this is the non-chopped up version. Then the mono single versions of "Natural Woman", "Since You've Been Gone" and its flip "Ain't No Way." If there was any album that made Aretha Franklin a household name, it sure is this. You can believe it. Ever since I got that Atlantic Rhythm & Blues box set, I've been wanting to dig deeper into some of the artists' music. With Aretha, I've heard of the "Lady Soul" album, and decided to start there. I wasn't let down, and neither will you be.

So it says on a 1950s-era paper sleeve for an Atlantic Records single. When you think about it from what you heard, what you saw, and what is in the stats, it's not just a simple promotional phrase. Rhythm and blues was increasingly making its mark on music at the close of the `40s and into the '50s. This kind of music was being marketed by small independent labels thatcame out by the dozen starting in the few short years after World War II. When you take a couple of all around great guys who absolutely love music, a musical trend that was just waiting to grow from its tiny seed to something no one at the time knew it would grow into a monster, a $10,000 loan from a dentist, lo and behold you got a label that smells of success. From that, inOctober 1947, Atlantic was born. This mammoth box set practically takes you on a dazzling musical journey of the label's roots in R&B; and flows through the years showing how it progressed. Chronicling 27 golden years, the 203 selections presented indicate the immeasurable impact R&B; fromAtlantic made on 20th century American music.Disc One (1947-1952) features some of the first historic cuts that weren't exactly fully jazz or fully bop but something totally new with a great, fresh tinge with artists like Joe Morris, Stick McGhee, Ruth Brown, The Clovers and some early Joe Turner. Disc Two (1952-1954) continues on and featuresthis new sound becoming hot and ever growing into something too big to ignore among disc jockeys and R&B; jukeboxes. Artists include Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, Joe Turner, and Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters. Discs Three (1955-1957) and Four (1957-1960) shows how R&B; made the crossover to white audiences and these records were selling fast. We see Ray Charles thrive as "the genius" along with Clyde McPhatter, LaVern Baker, a fun-loving group called the Coasters, the "new" Drifters, Chuck Willis andmore. Disc Five (1961-1965) sees R&B; getting a bit pop tinged on Ben E. King's and the Drifters' recordings. However there's still plenty of raw, gritty R&B; being pumped out as we hear the sound of southern R&B; courtesy of the new partnership with Stax/Volt Records featuring the Mar-Keys, Booker T. & the M.G.s and Otis Redding. Disc Six (1965-1967) is arguably the bestdisc in the whole set. Reason being is with the help of Stax/Volt, with many famous cuts from them, R&B; turned into soul. Among the Stax/Volt greats are Otis Redding, Sam & Dave, Eddie Floyd, and Booker T. and the M.G.s. Also there are the big smashes of Wilson Pickett, Percy Sledge, Arthur Conley, Aretha Franklin, Joe Tex and more. It's probably the most excitable disc, no doubt. Discs Seven (1967-1969) and Eight (1970-1974)display the continuation of gritty `60s soul, with the thriving of Aretha, the Bar-Kays, Clarence Carter, Archie Bell, Tyrone Davis and more, to the closing of an era glistened with some `70s funk and smooth soul from King Floyd, Betty Wright, Roberta Flack, the Persuaders, the Spinners and more.There is so much to be said about this marvelous box set. Each CD has more than 20 songs, most have more than 25 and clock in with more than 70 minutes of music on each disc. It goes pretty fast once you start getting into the music and you absolutely can. It will make you dance like wild, bring a smile to your face, a tear to your eye, make you laugh, sing along, reminisce, think, and dream. This is music; this was it was lived, breathed, ate, drank and slept. The influence of rhythm and blues on American music can not be measured for without it, what would music be, and without Ahmet and his founding Atlantic, how could music have thrived in this country? The answer, in my opinion: it would never, ever, EVER have been the same. Every single song on here is a masterpiece in its own way. Together this whole box set DOES reflect every human emotion ever known from celebrating life, finding love then losing it, happy, sad, dancing, etc. You name it; it's got it. I have never seen a box set so comprehensive; it puts other box sets, with the exception of "Stax/Volt Singles, Vol. 1", to absolute shame! Again, these songs reflect what we experience every day. Too numerous to mention, though. This box set is as all-American as the 4th of July, apple pie, hot dogs, a great old movie, cruising in a hot rod, ice cream cones, walks in the park, the joys of summer, young love, and just plain being alive. This is also practically a crash course on the history of 20th century American music, not just R&B.; In fact, I highly recommend schools and colleges purchase this box set to offer as examples in music courses and in music research projects. If they were to construct a time capsule filled with items representing all the major events of the 20th century, this box set would definetly be in there. What's not to love about it? There's a 30-page booklet included with stories about all the artists and the songs, photographs plus the entire song list featuring who played on what song and where and when the songs were recorded. The inserts for the discs (individual cover art) shows very colorful picture collages. The cover art of the box itself is the most obvious, but the most ingenious. At first glance, it looks like it should be "The Atlantic Records Story" and, in a way, it's true. That giant Atlantic label is like a big invitation to a musical journey that will leave you speechless at the end. Even if you're not an R&B; fan, this will change the way you feel about it for not only did these people play and sing from the heart but most essentially the soul. Take this music to a party and tell your friends about this musical treasure chest. If you had to purchase one CD box set in your lifetime, this is the quintessential pick, hands down! It's a rare worthwhile investement and something you'll want to keep forever! This did get a Grammy when initially released in 1985 for Best Historical Album. The sound quality is quite excellent for 1991 remastering. It can sound best on a system with much bass boost. Truly for the collector! It's a celebration of every aspect, genre and sub-genre of R&B;, a celebration of music, musical history, life, Ahmet Ertegun (on my list of all-time musical geniuses), and arguably the greatest name in rhythm & blues and the record business: ATLANTIC.

If you've seen the movie, and love the music in it, pick up this single disc reissue of the original classic 2-LP album. I have the original record album and played it quite frequently. It's good to hnag on to, but in the past year I bought this single disc and don't have to worry about this getting worn out.All the original songs from the film are here. The songs are done in the style a typical '50s rock'n'roll song or ballad. The title track by Frankie Valli went to #1. Performers are John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John, the cast that's too long tomention and the nostalgic group Sha-Na-Na. &quot;Grease is the word!&quot;

&quot;G.I. Blues&quot; was #2 on the top grossing films at the box office when it was released. The storyline is Elvis plays Tulsa MacLean. Him and his Army buddies are about to get out of the army and look forward to opening up their own nightclub back in Oklahoma. Along the way, Tulsa is caught up in a bet that sees if he can date the enticing and cold-as-ice Cafe Europa dancer Lili (Juliet Prowse). Tulsa and Lili go further than that: they take a modest cruise to across the river to a puppet show where Tulsa sings &quot;Wooden Heart&quot;. They both ride above a vineyard in a cablecar where again he breaks into &quot;Pocketful of Rainbows.&quot; Then Tulsa is asked to baby-sit for a buddy who ran away to get married, and he's caught in a tight situation. Him and Lili reunite and spend the night with each other baby-sitting &quot;Tiger&quot;. The bet is easily won. When Lili finds out, she's steamed! Little does she know that Tulsa really was Marla and Rick's baby-sitter. Tulsa and Lili come back together after an unexpected proposal, and following is an all-American Armed Forces Show finale where Tulsa and the rest of the memebers of the armed forces sing &quot;Did'ja Ever?&quot;.

Finally, a re-release of this film! "Casino Royale" is the best '60s spy film I ever saw. An outstanding cast and lots of familiar faces, wonderful score, amazing special effects, groovygirls, and lots of comedy. Although, I'm happy about this re-release, it's not in the right format I'm looking for. MGM is about to release the DVD but not a VHS. Does that make sense? I don't own a DVD player, and I'm pleased about this re-release. If MGM can put a new DVD copy out, they can make a VHS. PLEASE put a new VHS version out!!

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; was a film I longed to see for a long time.It has great scenery, moments of comical experience, groovy chicks, and a top leading/supporting cast. David Niven is outstanding as Sir James Bond, along with Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles and all the rest. The ending fight scene is side-splitting and action packed. Although it was kind of disappointing when the seven 007s died in the end. Great movie still. Please re-release and THX remaster it!

&quot;Elvis is Back&quot; first debuted on the charts back in April 1960. It peaked at #2. Now the same album has been re-issued with 6 new tracks that were top singles. Songs include &quot;Stuck On You&quot;, &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot;, &quot;Make Me Know It&quot;, &quot;Reconsider Baby&quot;, &quot;Dirty, Dirty Feeling&quot;, and much more! One of the best vintage Elvis album re-issues. Deserves to be part of anyone's Elvis music library. While you're at it, pick up the other Elvis album re-issues!

The Lovin' Spoonful is often unrecognized for their other great songs in their catalog besides the ones we all know: &quot;Do You Believe In Magic&quot;, &quot;Daydream&quot;, &quot;You Didn't Have To Be So Nice&quot;, and &quot;Summer in the City&quot;. On here are 26 selections from hit singles to album cuts you might not have heard but worthy of getting acquainted with. &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot; kind of stuck out at me with it's sunny-natured tone even though pictured on a rainy afternoon. The liner notes indicate its B-side is &quot;Pow! (Theme From 'What's Up, Tiger Lilly?')&quot; (What a silly name. Good fun!)That song is one of the must fun songs on here. There is a big musical montage as you listen to this disc. The band wasn't worried about experimenting. Why, on one of the last songs on the disc, they play on a typewriter! (Cool, huh?) This disc is marvelous overview of an often over-looked good-time '60s band.

&quot;Loving You&quot; could have almost been called &quot;The Elvis Presley Story&quot; since it revolves around a young truck driver who reluctantly gets his start in the music business by just singing for the locals at a picnic in a small Texas town. He reluctantly gets started and tours with a country/western band through every town in Texas and becomes a rock'n'roll superstar. It's the story of Elvis all over! The film doesn't get any better and very enjoyable. Look for Elvis' mother and father, Gladys and Vernon as cameo parts in the televised concert finale. Gladys can be clearlty seen on the right when Elvis dances in the aisle. Years after Gladys died, Elvis never wanted to see this picture again, even though that was the only appearance she was in. A good visual aid to the person who is just discovering Elvis. This is what he is REALLY like. &quot;Loving You&quot; comes so close to the beginning of the true story of Elvis Presley.

"My Man Godfrey" is one of those old classic films you must see sometime! David Niven magnificently portrays Gofrey, an Austrian illegally in the country who fears he will be deported if he is found out. He soon meets Irene Bullock (June Allyson) who is captured by his dapper charm as she hires him as her family's butler. Everyone in the family is cast under his charming spell except Irene's sister, Cordelia. In time, she, too, will be fascinated. As soon as detectives become suspicious, he feels he must go back to Europe despite Irene's disapproval. I don't feel suprised at her falling for a man as handsome as he is. On a boat returning, she runs after him and beforehand, he knows of a law that says a person illegally in the country can marry an American only after they've left American borders, which will probably happen when you see them together in the final shot with the Statue of Liberty in the background! This picture is delightful and David Niven is sleek, superb, girl-attracting, and distinguished. "My Man Godfrey",as one of the character's in the story, Vincent, would put it, is:"Lovely, lovely!"

The famous Minuet from the String Quintet of Boccherini, the Kalendar Prince from Rimsky-korsakov's Scheherzade, Handel's Largo form Xerses, Mendelsshon's Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage Overture, Bach's beautiful Prelude no. 1 in C Major (the best thing on here) and so much other beautifully played and beatiful sounding classics!

&quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; is slapstick comedy at its best. Peter Sellers truly knew how to do it. Getting up off of a bench knocking archrival Dreyfus into the water (and doing it countless times), tears his pants in the door, trying to get to a drawbridge to a castle but keeps falling in the water, and a clever disguise with a prop that sends Dreyfus hysterical! NEat special effects especially when Dreyfus' ray-gun backfires and him and his castles disappear. The final sequence is incredibly silly, the bedroom sequence with Tom Jones singing &quot;Come To Me&quot;.Great, insane fun!

Nonetheless, quite splendiferous from a group playing during a time of turbulance that gave people a feeling to appreciate life and to be alive during the '60s.

If you had to pick just one Elvis concert album out of all the ones out there, this is the one to pick. This concert when it was aired back in January 1973 watched by over 1.5 billion people. There is no reason why you should pass this up. 29 great tracks from a historical concert that was a landmark in the King's career! This album, when first released, went to #1 on the album charts. The last time he had a #1 album was back in 1964 with the soundtrack to &quot;Roustabout&quot;. From the first global broadcast ever, this is one special concert you should not miss.I bought this CD yesterday and I loved it. It's 75 1/2 minutes long and worth the money. &quot;Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite&quot; should definetly be in your Elvis music collection.

&quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; is an excellent movie. The kind I like to see. Elvis-like teen pop idol, swinging chicks, great soundtrack, Ed Sullivan, and a top all-star cast. Ann-Margret is just as lovely as ever. I enjoy movies from the '50s and '60s, and this is one of them. Just a feel-good picture. I know this sounds odd coming from a teenager, but &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; is a lot better than the teen junk they're making now.

Posed in one of my favorite Elvis suits, and multiple Elvis' posed on there, it's great cover art to an album defining some of Elvi's greatest pre-Army songs! "A Big Hunk O' Love" is a big hunk o' great rock'n'roll. Its B-side "My Wish Came True" is a great romantic ballad and slows things down a bit. Then it gets sped up again with "A Fool Such As I" and "I Need Your Love Tonight". I don't know why there are two Christmas songs on here, but its a great extra track addition. More suitable for listening to around Christmas time. All the rest of the songs are feel-good rockin' classics. This is one defintive album that is essential to anybody's Elvis library.

While the British Invasion was the rage in the U.S. during the '60s, across the pond, the dance floor was packed through the vibes of American-made soul music. Call it ironic, but the clubs that featured the music and the fans that came had excellent taste, I must say.Sony/BMG has now brought us 100 Northern Soul gems spread across four volumes each honoring the famous clubs and which songs were popular at those places. Volume 1 honors "The Twisted Wheel." Present soul music afficionados may know nothing about these clubs but will love all the great cuts that are on here. There really are no slow songs on here at all, so this is great keep-you-on-the-dance-floor party music. These English clubs loved to have "all-nighters" and it's easy to see how and why. There was absolutely nothing else in the popular music field that could get you moving like superb R&B.;Among these 25 tracks, there are a mixture of hits and misses, all of which are a treat to hear. Lou Johnson, who only had two R&B; hits in his career, starts it off with a sweet vibraphone-laced number called "Magic Potion." The great stomper "Hide and Go Seek" from Bunker Hill (if you saw the 1988 "Hairspray", it'll sound familiar; it was playing during the scene in the record shop). James Carr...oh is this fantastic...does"That's What I Want To Know" (that one has a bass guitar part that will blow your mind and get the blood pumpin'; it could inspire anybody to want to play the instrument). Oscar Toney Jr. gives us "No Sad Songs" featuring a fat and punchy horn line and a solid beat. Other cuts you may recognize are Lee Dorsey's "Ride Your Pony" and Bob Kuban's "The Cheater." Familiar artists like Major Lance, Little Richard, Al Green, Shirley Ellis, The Vibrations, Peaches & Herband the Shirelles have very unfamiliar but yet fantastic tracks to contribute. I love "A Little Bit of Something" from Little Richard, and "It's the Beat" and "Ain't No Soul in these Old Shoes" from Major Lance.Northern Soul music was a UK sensation during the '60s and early '70s and to this day here in America where it was all produced, it is still a sought-after genre for record collectors. Motown seemed to play a huge part in influencing the other companies and indie labels as far as style. Check out "Everybody's Going to the Love-In" from Bob Brady & the Con-Chords; it sounds exactly like Smokey Robinson & the Miracles "Going to a Go-Go" right down to Smokey's trademark falsetto. The quarter note snare drum feel was another popular Motown trait that also caught on.A lot of these songs on this volume alone are hard to find together on other discs and finding the original vinyl 45s could be a quest in itself. Here, you've basically got your work cut out for you.It's a relatively brand new set that's sure to please any classic R&B; fanall from the vaults of the Okeh, Bell/Mala, Date, Epic, and Columbia.

This CD has all of Elvis' Christmas songs he ever recordedplus 4 bonus tracks (2 previously unreleased!). Prepare to get comfortable on &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;, because it's slow and bluesy, plus it's nearly six minutes long. I really love that song. Some of my other favorites are &quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me&quot;, &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus Is Back In Town&quot;, and of course &quot;If Every Day Was Like Christmas.&quot; That song is very powerful and very moving. Celebrate the holiday with Elvis as he croons many of his wonderful Christmas classics.

During the days of the Renaissance, the madrigal was oneof the most popular musical forms and outputs. The King's Singers, a modern-day all male vocal group, demonstrate the authentic sound of which these 34 chosen madrigals may have been performed. In the Renaissance, in place of sopranos and altos, there were countertenors (men who sang falsetto in a feminine range). That's what these guys do; just listen to the first few and you'll automatically be transported back to this magical and sort of other-worldly time. If you've been to Renaissance fairs, it will make you think of those, too.The King's Singers offer 34 well-chosen madrigals from composers like John Dowland, Hans Leo Hassler, Clement Jannequin and some composers who wished to remain anonymous. They are grouped by the different languages to show that the madrigal wasn't just the rage in Italy where it had originated but at various other places all over Europe, the hub of the music world. The Italian ones come first, then in English, French, Spanish and German. The best one in the set is "La Guerre" which runs 6 minutes, and is an incredible vocal showpiece. It's even very funny at times.If you want to hear exactly how Renaissance madrigals sound, this is the real deal.

People say this isn't a classic, but I, however, think so. Don't think this movie is too childish. It's not. I'm 14 and I enjoyu every moment of it. It's so wonderful, magical, cute, and very warm in some parts. Tim Allen is hysterically funny, and with some of his lines. "Freezing my nubs off out here, and you want me to get into a Santa costume.", he says after furiously and reluctantly takes off his jacket and is in his underwear putting on Santa's suit, when the other Santa falls off of Scott Calvin's (Allen) roof. When he's inside the first house he takes out a plastic dump truck and it lightly thuds on the floor as he puts under the tree. In comes this Rottweiler growling at him. Scott puts on his most winning smile and says "Nice teeth." The dog barks at him. He tries to escape out of the window, but an alarm goes off. Someone upstairs yells "Who's down there?!" He inches his way towards the fireplace, with the dog growling at him, saying "It's the holidays. Come on. Whoo-hoo-hoo." All of a sudden there's a gunshot. Scott eventually gets back up the chimney and on his way to the next house. This is funny and will become a favorite in your holiday movie collection. (...).

Sam Cooke revolutionized R&B music in the '50s and '60s with his inimitable singing style and smooth, soulful voice. He was among the first and most successful to cross R&B over into the popular music field. To his fans, he ranks among the top male vocal performers of all time. This collection starts and closes with numbers from his gospel days with the Soul Stirrers ("Touch the Hem of His Garment", "Jesus Gave Me Water") and in-between are twenty-eight tunes, many of which he wrote, that marked his career singing popular music. You can really tell how his gospel style is permeant and how it shines through every song he delivers. Of course there all the classics like "Chain Gang", "You Send Me", "Another Saturday Night", "Wonderful World" among many more. "Portrait of a Legend" is more than just a marketing title; it is a fitting title describing the many apsects that Mr. Cooke had in his music whether it be the balladeer ("Cupid", "I Love You For Sentimental Reasons", "Nothing Can Change This Love"), the party-goer ("Having A Party", "Meet Me At Mary's Place"), the dancer ("Twistin' The Night Away", "Everybody Loves to Cha Cha Cha", "Shake"), and anything else he could try his hand at like the blues (Howlin' Wolf's "Little Red Rooster") and even a Gershwin classic like "Summertime." The liner notes accompanying this set are mainly on the songs and are very informative. All in all, this is the essential Sam Cooke package about all that he was: singer, songwriter, and legend.

This is no ordinary party, this is THE party. The glitzy glamourous, amourous, Hollywood party...want to give it another thought? Peter Sellers is Hrundi Bakshi, a struggling Indian actor, who after accidentally blowing up a set for an on-location film, the producers vow he'll never work in another film. When his name is taken down, he is accidentally put on the party invitation list. After arriving at the party, Bakshi is a demolition derby. He does all types of crazy, zany, unbelievable, and unimaginable things! If you've seen any of The Pink Panther films, this is like all of those films rolled into one. Plus, it's directed by the director of that series, Blake Edwards. You know in you're in for quite a treat. I love it when the whole house is flooded in huge soap bubbles and suds when the party is crashed and a painted elephant is being washed. This is one hysterical, crazy, out-of-this-world, silly, and hilarious party! Peter Sellers is the master of comedy!

&quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot; was Frank Capra's last motion picture he directed. For a last picture for him, I think it is quite a masterpiece. This is a remake of the 1933 movie &quot;Lady For A Day&quot; which Capra directed then. Bette Davis is wonderful as Apple Annie, a boozy street peddlar whose best customer is gangster leader Dave the Dude (Glenn Ford) who thinks her apples bring him luck. His flashy girlfriend Queenie Martin (Hope Lange) thinks otherwise, and the Dude can't keep her out of his hair. Peter Falk plays on his sidekicks named Joy Boy, and Mickey Shaugnessey (Elvis' costar in &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;) plays the Dude's other sidekick and chauffeur Junior. They all help Apple Annie a.k.a. Mrs. E. Worthington Manville prepare for her daughter (Ann-Margret) to come from Spain to visit with a Spanish count (Arthur O'Connell) and his son (Peter Mann). They announce that she will marry the count's son, and will give a reception. The Dude, Queenie, Joy Boy, Junior, and Apple Annie's temporary &quot;husband&quot; Judge Blake painstakingly round up the gang members of the dude and Queenie's chorus girls to try to impersonate officials and attend the reception. Meanwhile, the police, the comissioner, the governor, and mayor are hot on the job to track down missing reporters kinapped by the Dude. (We all know even though their tied up, Dude's still kind-hearted underneath). They're in a jam, when Queenie's nightclub is surrounded by cops. Dude makes a deal with the comissioner. What ends up happening is, the governor and mayor get word and the people at the coincidental party for the mayor show up miraculously for Annie's reception. At the end, it shows, Louise (Ann-Margret), the count and son Carlos leaving to go back to Spain where the two will get married. This is a real fanciful scene there. It's a real great classic everyone will enjoy.

Little Walter had an amazing harmonica sound and style that was all his own and could never be duplicated. Man, is this some hot stuff. His first record, "Juke", an instrumental is just, to quote another title of his, "off the wall." Yeah, there is a number that's called that which is on this CD. Absoultely what the blues is all about. Songs like "Sad Hours" and "Off the Wall" are practically Little Walter and the band sittin' around and jammin'. Check out the guitar lick at the beginning and the through the whole of "Sad Hours"; classic blues lick. Some other cool stuff is "Tell Me Mama", "Blues With A Feeling", "You're So Fine", "Mellow Down Easy", "My Babe", "Hate To See You Go", and especially "Boom, Boom Out Goes The Light." That one's a regular jam session, too. This is how music was made and appreciated to these guys. They just played as and what they felt. If you're learning about the blues, don't forget one of the supreme harmonica players of the genre: Little Walter.

Opening with "Moanin' at Midnight", Howlin' Wolf (Chester Burnett) uses a low hum filled with overtones that distorts the microphone for eight seconds until the guitar and drums enter. The Wolf then does a distorting howl and then goes on the harmonica and the tempo gradually increases to become the instant Delta blues classic that it is. It is one of the strangest yet one of the neatest sounds that was ever part of a song. When you hear it, don't worry because your speakers aren't broken. The song sounds pretty good from something from 1951. That song and its B-side "How Many More Years" were recorded for Sam Phillips in Memphis. The masters were sold to Chess when the Wolf was signed to Chess, too. The 18 other songs are pure, raw blues. The Chess musicians were a fine group of musicians and really knew how to crank out the blues especially with people like Howlin' Wolf. "Smokestack Lightning", "I Asked for Water", "Hidden Charms", and "Killing Floor" have hot guitar licks. Listen for "Spoonful"; yeah! That's another hot one. The entire song is flawless and there's a neat rhythm and a drive to it. My favorite! I've suddenly taken an interest in blues music and this is indeed a sheer example of what the blues was all about. I was more into the rock'n'roll of those days and not necessarily straight and pure blues. Man, they had some real good stuff then. If you're just discovering Howlin' Wolf, this is the one to really lend an ear to. You'll be glad you did. WOO-OO!

This is a good basic collection of all the well-known Bo Diddley songs with a few B-sides that were quite well-known. This is rock 'n' roll at its finest among finest. Bo Diddley was one of the originators of rock'n'roll along with Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis; these guys invented rock'n'roll!! Bo's music is an excellent example of '50s rock 'n' roll even though he wasn't a major success on the charts. &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, &quot;I'm A Man&quot;, &quot;Diddley Daddy&quot;, &quot;Pretty Thing&quot;, &quot;Road Runner&quot;, &quot;The Story of Bo Diddley&quot;, and &quot;You Can't Judge a Book By Its Cover&quot; are the best songs on here. They rock the house! They're all good, basically. As Bo proclaims in &quot;The Story of Bo Diddley&quot;: &quot;I'm a killer diller.&quot;

A fitting name for such a golden group that was definetly one of the most important doo-wop groups of the '50s. This 16-track compilation opens with their signature song, "Sincerely". This song never sounded better; the remastering is that perfect for a 50 year old song. Listen to it on a machine with heavy bass boost; it kicks boo-tay! Other songs on here include their cover of Doris Day's "Secret Love" (their first record and cut with the Chance label which shortly afterward became defunct). The group then moved up the street to Chess and signed a contract. There's "Shoo-Doo-Be-Doo" recorded as Bobby Lester and the Moonlighters on the Checker label, "In My Diary", "See Saw" with Harvey Fuqua on lead and a wailing sax player, "The Masquerade Is Over", which might have you smiling if not laughing when you hear the bass man singing, "Ten Commandments of Love", another classic, "Blue Velvet" (yes, the same one that Bobby Vinton later covered). There are more songs to enjoy including the smooth closing track "Twelve Months of the Year" with the spoken parts done by a young Marvin Gaye. 4 more songs would have made this more complete, but I'm sure record companies have their reasons for marketing things as they are. What's not to enjoy?

Quite good that this JXL, whoever he is, decided to remix an Elvis song. But who would think a then unpopular Elvis movie song would now become the #1 single in America and over 20 other countries worldwide. I haven't heard all 3 tracks on this, but I have seen the Nike commercial via RealOne Player. It sounds great, and Elvis would be proud. Great job to JXL for giving rebirth to my main man, Elvis Presley, the KING of Rock'n'Roll!

"Kissin Cousins" is another film that is considered, by popular opinion to be a cheeseball. You have to try this film first and see what you think. If you like it and recommend it write a review here. I'd like to add that Elvis movie fans better listen up! If you like any of his films, POST A REVIEW FOR PETE'S SAKE! I see only 5+ reviews for his movies. Disappointing! In fact I see it on all products that's Elvis except the 30 #1 Hits CD which has 205+. MUCH BETTER! Finally we wised up on that one. Getting back to "Kissin' Cousins", Elvis does double duty and plays an air force pilot named Josh Morgan (my name, except for the Morgan part) and his hilbilly blonde look-alike Jodie Tatum. I'm still wondering how this film was done with two Elvis on the screen at once in some scenes. I agree with the person who said that Yvonne Craig should have been in more of Elvis' pictures. She's a hot potato. Again, give this one a try and rely on what your thoughts tell you. Elvis is still the King no matter what type of picture he's in. This one is pretty good, overall.

If you enjoyed the movie, you're going to love the soundtrack. But, then again, you really don't have to love the movie to enjoy the soundtrack. I loved the movie and watched it over 20 times. I can't get enough. Sadly, I don't own the film but rented it all those times. So, I had to get this soundtrack.The title theme played by Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass sounds excellent, Dusty Springfield's &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; sounds good andromantic turned up (you can almost feel like Evelyn Tremble in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;), &quot;Moneypenny Goes For Broke&quot;, &quot;Le Chiffre's Torture Of The Mind&quot;, &quot;Home James, Don't Spare The Horses&quot; and all the rest sound absolutely incredible. In STEREOPHONIC SOUND.&quot;Hi There, Miss Goodthighs&quot; wouldn't be anything without that saxophone. The soundtrack is almost a mish-mosh like the movie is,(heck, it works), but that's usually the formula. This soundtrack deserves 10 stars. I only wish the CD was longer. If you find this CD is too short and you love the music, don't hesitate the play it twice. To all the people, who didn't want to see the film but own the soundtrack, you won't follow the track names. You probably ask &quot;Who is Le Chiffre?&quot;. Then you consider yourself lost. Watch the movie. I think you'll like it, even though it's a whole stewpot of things. Getting back to the CD, it's great music and THE definitive James Bond music. This is a good one to jack the bass up on.

&quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; ranks up there with &quot;Rudolph&quot;. Both of them are repeatedly shown every Christmas. That's a good thing! There's alway something decent on TV at around Christmastime. The classic song is a holiady cartoon narrated by Jimmy Durante. It's something every child should see at Christmas. Merry Christmas!

Elvis returns with his his first post-Army soundtrack. Wonderful music and incredible sound. When it was first released in 1960 in was at 10 weeks at #1, and spent 111 weeks on the charts. The top-selling soundtrack album! You know it's essential if you're a true and big Elvis fan like me. You'll be marching along to "Did'ja Ever". The new bonus tracks are a treat for the ears. On "Pocketful of Rainbows" take 2, Elvis stops at the beginning. He says something about his throat and sings a little bit of "Doin' The Best I Can" and says "I'll tell you what: let's try it one more time, and if she meant--I mean, if I crack, well uh--" One of the studio personnel says, "You crack, you got a new world's record. It's 29." Elvis coughs and clears his throat. "I did 60 one time, and the record never came out." They go one with the next take. With rare hearings of behind-the-sessions takes, and great soundtrack "G.I. Blues" is an essential edition to your Elvis library.

The original 1961 album release of "Blue Hawaii", had 14 songs on it. Now this expanded version has 22. Is that good or what? The new 8 extra tracks, except one, have never been released before. Isn't that great? It was about time they were pulling some unreleased takes of songs out of the vaults. This is something that is quintessential to every Elvis fan. "Blue Hawaii" features the title song, "No More", "Can't Help Falling In Love", "Rock-a-Hula-Baby", "Moonlight Swim","Hawaiian Wedding Song", plus more. "Steppin' out of Line", the original, was the one bonus track already released. It was released one year after the original "Blue Hawaii" album came out on "Pot Luck". By the way, be sure to get that one as well. This is an outstanding job RCA did on this! "Dreams come true in blue Hawaii, and mine could all come true, this magic night of nights with you." (Elvis Presley). Elvis rocks all the way!

&quot;King Creole&quot; is right up there with &quot;Loving You&quot; Again, watch the movie first, then hear the teriffic music. You're going to love both. The main title theme starts off the soundtrack. High-energy tracks. They include &quot;King Creole&quot;, &quot;As Long As I Have You&quot;, &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot;, &quot;Dixieland Rock&quot;, &quot;Young Dreams&quot;, and more. This is a teriffic Elvis soundtrack reissue. The only flaw with this is even with more tracks it is still too short. Heck, I listened to it several dozen times, and I'm satisfied. What RCA can retrieve from the vaults, is what we get. We need more reviews on Elvis' music and his movies, PLEASE! It goes to show you how little he's appreciated in some areas.

My aunt has the original 1963 album. It's fantastic. This 1997 reissue of &quot;Elvis' Golden Records Volume 3&quot; is even more fantastic with the extra tracks. They do make the ablum longer. This time, like most times, the extra tracks are at the end where the old album left off. The original starting track, &quot;It's Now Or Never&quot;, is thrilling, timeless, and romantic as ever. &quot;Little Sister&quot; is downright nasty and a great rockin' song! I love it, baby! Elvis shows in this compilation he still had that great singing talent after his return from the Army!

Elvis still shown in the mid-'60s that he still had it despite the British Invasion. Before I go on to say more about this fantastic album, I notice there are 500+ reviews for the Beatles' albums, but only 5+ for Elvis. WHY?! THAT'S NOT FAIR! Elvis will always be to me the greatest rock'n'roll singer ever! You're entitled to your opinion. Getting back to &quot;Elvis' Gold Records Volume 4&quot;, this is as equally as fantastic as all of the other Golden Records volumes. They are the essential recordings and musts for every fan. &quot;Return To Sender&quot; is a good way to start this one off. I really like &quot;Ask Me&quot;, and &quot;Ain't That Loving You Baby&quot;. You'll enjoy this one if you really love Elvis like me.

The last two symphonies that Mozart wrote, K550 and K551, are considered the best ones. On this disc, the Mozart Festival Orchestra and Richard Edlinger the conductor bring you probably in my opinion the best performances of those symphonies. This is beautiful music that came from a more-gifted-than-no-other composer!

&quot;Kid Galahad&quot; stars Elvis as an ex-G.I. who comes back to his hometown in upper state New York. Beautiful scenery, I might add. He wants to be an auto mechanic after returning from the Army, but instead he's reluctantly roped into being trained to be a boxer. Elvis has an anvil-fist and an iron jaw. Soon, he becomes boxing champ nicknamed &quot;Kid Galahad&quot;. Joan Blackman returns and plays Elvis' love interest and the sister of the boxing camp owner Gig Young. Great picture formula, great songs and beautiful and breathtaking mountain scenery. Recommend this must-see to everyone.

If I had to summon up the content of this whole movie in one word, it would be: &quot;exotic&quot;. Why I say that is because of the scenery, the palm trees, the Waikiki beach, the beach boys and girls, the Hawaiian music, the ukeleles, the luau, EVERYTHING! Elvis is a returning G.I. who does not want to go into his family's pineapple business. Instead, he works for a tourist guide service, and his first customers are a pack of gorgeous-looking girls and a beautiful chaperoning schoolteacher (Nancy Walters). Beautiful Hawaiian wedding scene at the end when Elvis marries Joan Blackman. Angela Lansbury is perfect for Elvis' mother in this picture. She enjoyed working with Elvis. &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; is quintessential and Elvis' top picture andhis best '60s musical next to &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, and &quot;G.I. Blues&quot;.

&quot;Flaming Star&quot; was a deeply moving picture that shows what Elvis would have really gone if it wasn't for the reoccuring musical comedy roles...but I'M NOT COMPLAINING! I like all of Elvis' movies. This is one that is little too violent, although Elvis probably appreciated a dramatic role. The acting done by Elvis is superb, and so is Barbara Eden's and Dolores Del Rio's. Elvis only sings two songs and that's it. Very violent since it deals with fighting indians and arrows hitting people in the back and blood surging out. That's not for me, but the only reason it's good is the acting and of course, Elvis.

&quot;Girl Happy&quot; is a lot better than that Beatles' flick &quot;Help!&quot;. Elvis sings a lot better and looks a whole lot better than some mop-tops. If there are some of you people out there who disagree with me, that's OK. You're entitled to your own opinion. Elvis charms Shelley Fabares as he plays a combo leader whom their manager wants him and his combo to go to Ft. Lauderdale to watch their manager's daughter and protect her from girl happy boys on spring break. Sort of like &quot;Where The Boys Are&quot; but better.

If you or your family likes Elvis like I do, you must see this picture. I know this didn't get huge ratings but it's an entertaining Elvis film. I definetly like when Elvis and young Vicky Tiu ride on the monorail at dusk at the Seattle World's Fair and Elvis singing to himself &quot;They Remind Me Too Much Of You&quot; In this movie, Elvis has a big fight scene, as he always did in his movies. Elvis actually loved doing those fight scenes. He actually was fighting, but the crew was worried and said &quot;Come on, Elvis, let's let someone double for you.&quot; Elvis refused and said &quot;No, I want to do my own fights.&quot; I've first seen this when I was in second grade and I loved it when I first saw it, and still do. I know you're bound to enjoy it.

This is the unusual but nice-sounding song that all the Whos down in Who-ville sing in "How The Grinch Stole Christmas". The classic Dr. Seuss tale of a mean nasty Grinch who hated Christmas as opposed to the Whos down in Who-ville who liked it very much. After 54 years of putting up with it, he tries to stop Christmas fromcoming. "But how?". Wonderful treat, for everyone."Horton Hears a Who" is a great addition and also deals with Who-ville, too!

Don't go for the 40th anniversary set. Go for the big 5-0 instead! 50 selections crammed onto two CD's. This set is perfect, for the storage capacity of both discs were taken full advantage of. Disc 1 is over 77 minutes long and disc 2 is nearly 80 minutes with just seconds left on the disc. The sound quality is superb. This sounds the best on a system with a lot of bass emphasis. The bass licks on all of these songs rock! From 1956's "Please Please Please" to 1988's "Static" covering three decades of an electrifying career. Ol' J.B. was and still is the hardest working man in show business. He had so many musical competitors during his time, but he made his mark. He had pretty good chart success, but a lot of these songs you hardly will ever hear on the radio. All you'll hear is the overplayed "I Got You" and "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag." (FYI: James Brown got a Grammy for that song.) Hear what you've been missing if you like JB but never get to hear his greatest. The reason why this set was released in 2003 was because that's when JB started his career. JB40 (1996): 40 years after JB released "Please, Please, Please." Be prepared for two and a half hours of the most soulful music ever from the Godfather himself. Who else? So please, please, please get a brand new bag and give JB a whirl. Once you do, you'll be doing the popcorn, workin' up a cold sweat, makin' it funky, gettin' on the good foot, getting into and getting involved, doing it to death and feeling the static. You'll be saying it's too funky in here, but, brother you'll feel good!! Recommend this to total strangers, 'cause everybody's got soul!

Why would anybody not want to have a Dr. Elvis? I probably would. Here, Elvis is in a dramatic part as a doctor of a clinic in the slums. He has three new assistants which are nuns in disguise. Mary Tyler Moore is one of them, and she soon falls for the doctor. Elvis' character is stunned when she reaveals herself. At the end of the film, she is deciding who to go with: the church or the doctor, the church or the doctor. It keeps flashing on-screen: a crucifix, Elvis, a statue of Mary, Elvis. Elvis is in the church with the Mass beginning singing "Let Us Pray". After that, Elvis' movie career was through. Check this one out. You won't regret it.

Bugs Bunny is found as the head doctor of a clinic trying to help this obese lady bunny try to watch what she eats at the Thanksgiving table. In between, he listens to Sylvester's problems, too.

"Christmas in July" is among the finest and yet unappreciated comedies of Hollywood's golden age. Dick Powell, a newcomer at Paramount studios, portrays Jimmy MacDonald who has entered a coffee company's slogan contest with the grand prize being $25,000. Some of his co-workers play a joke on him with a fake telegram. Jimmy and his fiance, Betty Casey (Ellen Drew) become excited as Jimmy is thought by his boss as being such a genius at writing slogans that Jimmy gets his own office and Betty is his private secretary. After they pick up the check (surprising to Dr. Maxford of Maxford House Coffee who doesn't know of anybody selected), they go on a shopping spree buying something for everybody in their neighborhood. Probably the only reason for the film's title is because Ellen Drew gives the line "It's like Christmas, in July." When Dr. Maxford finds out nobody was selected and the check was supposedly fake, Shindel Bros., the department store of which they went on a spree, starts to take everything back until the pompous Dr. Maxford steps in. Shindel is convinced when the townspeople take Jimmy's side and not Dr. Maxford's. Later, as they view Jimmy's new office, his boss is still impressed with his slogan-writing ability until when he hears Jimmy didn't really win and it was a joke. His boss goes into a fury, but Betty takes Jimmy's side by saying that he belongs in his own office becuase he thinks he has ideas and gives a short speech to him. In Maxford House, Dr. Maxford gets into a huge fit when he is distressed at the contest and that his workers have finally selected a winner. Guess who? Quite likely, the cycle will start again. Amazing film, and quite amazing what you can fit in a short 67 minute film.

&quot;Did someone call me Schnorer?&quot; &quot;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!&quot;This great follow-up to &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; which was filmed, too, in New York, tells of Groucho as Captain Geoffrey Spaulding or Captain Spaulding of Scotland Yard. By the way, when he introduces himself at times he switches the words around. He tells of his misadventures to Margaret Dumont and Chicho, who plays &quot;Sugartime&quot; repeateldy and can't think of the finish, and Harpo who joins in. Zeppo is Groucho's secretary who is left out of the comedy. They work together on the case of mysterious paintings. See this great Marx Brothers classic! It's a must!

&quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; was the Marx Brothers first film, and one look at it shows you this is excellent. This was a big box-office grosser. &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; was filmed on stage in the Paramount Studios in New York. That may be the reason why the sound seems like it echos. The sound is not the greatest, but what can you expect from a film that was made two years after the first talking picture &quot;The Jazz Songer&quot; was made. Grouch plays a hotel owner with Zeppo as his assistant. Groucho takes Chico and Harpo under his wing and watches them carefully. For instance when they first arrive, their suitcase breaks open and it's empty. Chico says, &quot;That's all right. We'll fill it up when we leave.&quot; Soon Margaret Dumont's necklace becomes snatched by two unscrupulous theives, Penelope and Harvey Yates. They get on the case, find the necklace, and try to keep Polly Potter, Dumont's character's daughter, and hotel clerk Bob Adams together. This is a perfect Marx masterpiece.

When I say &quot;safe&quot;, I mean where Elvis does not killed in the end like in &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, and &quot;Flaming Star.&quot; This something that's much better and I prefer a whole lot. Elvis has not one but three female costars: Hope Lange, Tuesday Weld, and Millie Perkins. I don't know about you but he gives an equal amount of attention to every one of them except near the end when he focuses more on Hope Lange. I love the songs which are: &quot;Wild In The Country&quot;, &quot;I Slipped, I Stumbled, I Fell&quot;, &quot;In My Way&quot;, and &quot;Husky Dusky Day&quot;. My favorite line is when Elvis as Glenn Tyler says &quot;This routine of yours could stagger a billygoat.&quot; That's one of his best lines. All Elvis fans should see this once in their lifetime. It's a must!

"American Graffiti" is great inspirational classic that can really grab your attention. Not only are the great cool-looking cars great, and the top soundtrack is, too, but the storyline is great. Set on a late summer night in 1962, four high school friends, two of them are graduates, spend their last night together before the two leave for college. At first at the beginning with that timeless "Rock Around the Clock" playing over Steve's (Ronny Howard) car radio in his marvelous '58 Chevy which I adore, the four friends meet at the local drive-in called Mel's. There is Curt (Richard Dreyfuss, Steve, John (Paul Le Mat), and Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith). They are all uncertain of their futures. Curt and Steve are the ones leaving for college, but Curt doesn't know for sure if he's going. Steveis raring to go at first. As the night progresses, they split from Mel's. Curt goes wth his sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Steve to the hop. John goes looking for s good time, and on the lookout for a could-be-next-drag-racing champ in a black '55 Chevy. The Toad is just out cruising around like everybody else on the main strip. Later, he meets Debby (Candy Clark), a sort of mixed-up girl who puts Toad in the wrong direction almost. John gets an unexpected surprise from a Studebaker when a 15-year old girl named Carol (Makenzie Phillips) cruises around with him. John's not thrilled at first, but Carol eventually grows on him, when they both flatten the tires and spray shaving cream all over a white '59 Dodge, and when John finally meets his maker in the '55 Chevy called Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), or when John goes to the a junkyard filled with old cars as he shows Carol who was the best of the best in drag-racing. Curt gets mixed up with a non-threating but cool gang called the Pharaohs led by Joe (Bo Hopkins). These are crazy and funny, and I love that maroon '51 Mercury. Steve and Laurie try to figure out what to do with their lives once Steve leaves, which causes them to break up. Curt meets Wolfman Jack who plays the great songs over the radio as they both try to find out who the mysterious and beautiful blonde is in the white '56 T-Bird. This and more all leads up to the race between John and Bob Falfa. This moment is stunning and a keep-you-on-the-of-your-seat moment. Could Falfa be the new champ? Both race fast down the road, when Falfa's Chevy spins off the road and topples over into falmes. Falfa and Laurie, who gets picked up earlier that night make it out okay as Steve and John try to tear them apart.Steve and Laurie happily runite, and John wins the race but losing his crown as champ. Curt meanwhile gets in touch with the blonde, but her identity is still mysterious. The end is at the airport, where they all meet again. Curt decides to go, bidding his friends and family good-bye. As he is on the plane, he looks out the window and sees the white T-Bird going down the road. After this shot we see the pictures of the four guys and the following:John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada.A true must-see coming of age story that everyone should see.

A fine feel-good rip-roaring musical that is too god to resist. Doris Day is perfect as Calamity Jane as she thinks that even a cowgirl can get her ways, too. Even though she tries, she can't get her &quot;secret love&quot; Bill Hickcock (Howard Keel) out of her mind. Rowdy, rambunctious, funny and full of wonderful musical and highly entertaining song and dance numbers, &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; is a winner! They sure don't make them like that anymore.

Tommy James &amp; the Shondells are one of the best bands of the '60s no doubt! If you want to get the sheer and best songs they ever recorded, every single one you could get, this is it! Make no mistake about it. With over 70 minutes of music, this album will have you rockin' and rollin'. So what if you're 15 like me, and your friends say that you listen to out-of-date music? Let it go in one ear and out the other. Music of the '50s, '60s, and some '70s (early in the decade mostly) is all I listen, too. Tommy James and the Shondells &quot;Anthology&quot; is a definitive part of your oldies CD library.

&quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; can be enjoyed even by someone who's not a fan of big band or jazz music. It's for everyone especially music lovers of all tastes. Jimmy Stewart is cast superbly here and at times you're thinking you're watching the actual Glenn Miller himself and not the actor. The music of Glenn Miller is brought to life so magically with its captivating soundtrack filled with his most memorable tunes and melodies like &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot; and the one everyone knows: &quot;Moonlight Serenade.&quot; The colors on this film are vivid and make you wish you'd want to be there. It was indeed tragic to lose such a great musician all too soon. You still hear his music in movies, nightclubs, theaters and more. All in all, it is a neat movie to look at and to hear remembering the trombonist who became the leader of the band: Glenn Miller.

&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; wins hands down as Elvis' best '60s musical comedy. Elvis singing the title tune which is my favorite sequence in the picture along with &quot;I Need Somebody To Lean On&quot;, &quot;If You Think I Don't Need You&quot; and more. Ann-Margret is so good-looking in this picture. She and Elvis should have made more pictures together and sooner, too. A treat for every Elvis fan everywhere and great addition to one's Elvis movie library!

"Elvis and Me" is ony of my favorite books I'v ever read simply because he's my favorite singer and my favorite person of all time, and because it's a great one-in-a-million book. This touching and moving story is told neatly and accordingly by Priscilla who experienced her life as the King's love interest, and later becomes his wife, and become unfortunately separated but they've never lost contact with each other. There are a lot of things about Elvis I never knew before that are in here: His total disinterest in making "G.I. Blues" (I can't imagine why other than he just returned from the Army), and his addiction to prescription drugs staring before the end of his life. It was the Army that got him started on prescription pills. Not because he felt like it, people. Read this wonderful page-turner and see what you think. You'll find out a lot of information. One other thing, Elvis swears in this book several times, but don't let that stop you from loving him.

Wonderful portraying by Clifton Webb. No other American musical comes close to &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever.&quot; If you've watched this film and enjoyed it, you'll love &quot;The Music Man&quot;. No musical holds a candle to these two! If you're proud to be an American, like me, you'll be entertained by this movie every time you see it. The way the marches are played in this film is extraordinarily exuberant. Treat yourself to a outstanding biography that is Americana at its best!

This was made by the makers of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;: Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass. In this show, we find Santa who has become to tired to make his annual trip around the world, an also he fears that the Christmas spirit is gone. Mrs. claus sends two of the elves, Jingle and Jangel out to Southtown to see if the Christmas spirit is still around. Along the way, Santa, in search of them and Vixen, makes a family there believe in Santa again. Then, a deal is made with the bickering Miser brothers about if it can snow down south, and if it can have a spring day up north. The deal is made, but all the children want Santa Claus to make his trip. He's finally convinced, holds a meeting and has a big parade in the middle of town before taking off. At the end, it looks like the whole thing was a dream. Was it? I couldn't catch on with it. Still, it's a wonderful holiday film for the family!

"Hairspray" captures early '60s life in Baltimore as Tracy (Ricki Lake) a young and chunky fan of a local dance TV show makes her way to become the star of it. Though she is poked fun at, nothing stops her including winning the heart of another dance regular on the show. The action of the story is centered around her as she also tries to have the dancing show entirely integrated. This movie is a very cheeky one that also adresses some very important social issues like civil rights. Tracy and her friends discard the snobbish attitudes towards minorities and strive for integration for everyone. It's a very cool flick filled with great early '60s rock'n'roll and R&B classics. There is a soundtrack, but sadly not all of the 30-some songs heard in this movie are there. It'd be nice to have all the songs though like "American Graffiti." There is an all-star cast including Sonny Bono, who stars as the father of Tracy's rival on the dance floor, rhythm & blues legend Ruth Brown as the town dee-jay, Motormouth Maybelle, and Divine as Tracy's Mother. All you MPT viewers from Baltimore, look for Rhea Feiken in a cameo role as Tracy's geometry teacher. It's also interesting that once the parents each get a good look at what their kids are into, they become hip like them. You've got to see this movie to know what I mean. Not only is it great for the music, the dancing, the nostalgic feel and the familiar faces, but also because of the righteous message that we learn...as well as doing the "Madison Time." Hit it!

Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, Dee Dee Sharp, the Orlons and the Dovells became major stars on "American Bandstand" in the early '60s. What did they all have in common? They were local Philadelphia acts, yes, but were all working for Bernie Lowe's local Cameo-Parkway record company. This label was rather unique in the fact that it presented a vast variety of styles during its 10 year existence in the popular music scene. As far as different genres go, it was like having the ultimate record collection with every genre imaginable and the collector would have the widest tastes and was open to just about anything. That was the principle behind Cameo-Parkway: record just about anything if it was felt to have sale potential. That seemed to be the theme of this more than overdue collection honoring this unique company finally getting its due. Record collectors and those who can remember these golden days vividly will associate Cameo-Parkway with all the dance crazes that the stars presented: Chubby Checker gave us "The Twist" followed up by "Let's Twist Again", "Limbo Rock", and "Pony Time" among others; Dee Dee Sharp had "Mashed Potato Time", the follow-up "Gravy", and "The Bird", the Dovells had "Bristol Stomp", "Do the New Continental" among others, and the Orlons with "The Wah-Watusi", "South Street", and "Crossfire!" among others. These of course were the label's principal stars and like any box set honoring a certain label, along with the hitmakers you get all these other lesser-known artists and just plain unknowns. It's done for reasons of balance as well as space alone. Each disc clocks in under 75 minutes, though technically all could have reached 80 if possible with a few noteworthy tracks that are not present like Chubby Checker's "The Fly", "Dancin' Party", and "The Hucklebuck" (a personal favorite), as well as the Dovells' "Hully Gully Baby" and even "Stop Monkeyin' Aroun'" (another favorite). So, in short, the big stars could have had a significant amount of more of their hits, but room had to be left for obscurities worth discovering if it's a first for you. 115 songs across 4 discs is plenty enough though with 25+ on each disc in superior sound. If this being played on a stereo, any sound anamolies are barely audible, but the sound is nonethless very satisfactory.Recommended listening? Absolutely. Recommended buying? It depends.Those who can remember some of the Wyncote reissue albums that featured the major acts and their hits large and small shouldn't expect a big elaboration on that. There was more to Cameo Parkway than the dance crazes and Chubby, Bobby, Dee Dee, etc. As mentioned before, they recorded just about anything from rockabilly and doo-wop (first part of disc 1) [check out "Memory Lane" by the Hippies/Tams/Stereos; very vintage sounding], to pop and rock, to novelty and even some country/western (Clint Eastwood singing???)and British invasion as well as later to R&B;/soul and garage band rock. Artists like Patti LaBelle, Bobby Marchan, Eddie Holman, the Five Stairsteps, and even Bob Seger show up revealing their brief stints with the company during it's waning days when founder Bernie Lowe lost interest and faith in his company since the British Invasion swept the country and as a result, companies like his got lost in the shuffle. C-P tried to catch on to the craze, but wasn't so successful. Their hit-making roster's hits dried up as well as the relocation of Bandstand out west and no longer giving C-P the big boost. That being said, if you like a particular genre, it's meshed up in the mix somewhere, and if you listen to it for the first time, a lot of patience is required. It seems that its focus becomes, if not satisfying everyone's taste, lost or skewed. One minute you're listening to doo-wop, the next you're up twisting and stomping, then you're groovin' to the British beat, and then slow-dancing to R&B;/soul ballads. So, the feel of the collection jumps around a lot. If you want to relive these days as closely as possible, all of this music does the trick as much of it is some of the most dated music you'll ever encounter. Many of the obscure singers and their songs especially sound that way and the lyrics may seem rather dire, ridiculous and silly to those first discovering it or can't remember them at all, since it's been so long and now it seems like another and almost "lost" dimension. Years ago, a Baltimore radio station featured a program called "Forgotten 45s" and a lot of these songs sound like eligible candidates. The nostalgia and time machine-like trip back in time though the sound of the music never fails to permeate the air; it's like watching old TV commercials. It isn't timeless (they were no Motown, and definitely no Stax/Volt), but it is very enjoyable.Nevertheless, this set is interesting, if nothing else. It has been a long time coming, but this is as closely as possible, the story of Cameo-Parkway. The liner notes for this collection are in a CD-sized 40+ page booklet complete with track listing, chart and release info, as well as musician credits all arranged alphabetically and not under each track. It definitely could have been packaged with a lot more care including way more photos aside from the ones of the company bosses and record labels, an LP-sized box to make it more outstanding rather than in a small paper one. The CD's look like little records and the bottoms are black, and the sleevs are apparently supposed to be like record sleeves, so that's a clever facet about it.If you just like Chubby, Bobby, Dee Dee, the Orlons, the Dovells, ? & the Mysterians only, you're better off picking up the CD's just of them that have also arrived in the wake of this collection. But if you like to get into popular music history and want to hear some vintage-sounding golden oldies (like discovering a malt shop jukebox) in the original hit recordings (that means no cheap re-records that we've been stuck with for so long), this serves as a very nice, if not quintessential pick.

"Charro!" is an okay film. Elvis plays a reformed outlaw who decides to go straight. But his former gang won't let him. They put an ugly scar on his neck that marks him as a killer. He then takes on his former gang members to try to make them return a stolen Mexican war cannon. All they do with it is frightenthe townspeople. Now, the bad-gone-good Elvis can save the people and stop the gang in its tracks. If you see, and don't enjoy it because there's a lot of violence, I don't know what to say. Very far from "Loving You", that's for sure.

"Uncle Buck" is a great family comedy that finds John Candy in the title role who is reluctantly called upon in a family emergency: he's left in charge of taking care of his brother's three children. As he holds down the fort, Uncle Buck displays rather unusual habits like cooking a very weird breakfast, and also jumbo sized pancakes for one of the children's, Miles (Macaulay Culkin), birthday [sweet], doing the laundry like hanging the clothes from a rotating ceiling fan as a blowdryer blows in their direction, facing off verbally with the school principal, keeping a young girl-crazy dude in check, and somehow managing to keep his smokebomb, backfiring car intact. It's indeed silly. All the while, even with his lovable bizareness, the children learn important life values, particularly the eldest and rebellious neice (Jean Louisa Kelly). Buck manages to pull it off impressing everyone from the children's returning parents to his girlfriend (Amy Madigan). It's an outrageously funny picture. There's something for everyone of all ages though not particularly aimed at a children's audience, but they'd enjoy it too.The DVD picture looks quite colorful and sharp and so's the surround sound. About the widescreen picture is what I have a quibble over. I saw the VHS version some time ago, and I remembered how certain parts of the movie looked on that in comparison to this DVD. It looks like the VHS picture was taken and the top and bottom were cut off to get black bars there to make it look like widescreen. For example, when Buck is in the kitchen singing "Tweedlee Dee" with the radio, there's a shot of him from the back. The floor was in the shot, but on the DVD it looks as if it was cut off. You can still enjoy the movie for this is only a minor quibble. Another may be the limited special features, not even a theatrical trailer. The production notes about the movie are very informative, I must say. The different language soundtracks cannot be changed while the movie is playing; you have to press the menu button and change it there if you desired to suddenly hear it in the Spanish or French that's provided. This DVD release was from back in the day when DVDs were relatively new so maybe that kind of adjustment where languages could be switched over while the movie was playing came later. That's what's on my copy at least. In any case, a great enjoyable movie, great performance by John Candy, and a fairly decnt DVD treatment. If you're not meticulous about these widescreen notices, good for you. Enjoy "Uncle Buck". Admit it; who wouldn't want to have this guy for an uncle?

"Mr. Holland's Opus" is, in my opinion, one of the greatest contemporary classics. This film shows how a teacher can have a tremendous impact on years' worth of students. Richard Dreyfuss is a struggling composer and musician who is "dragged into" teaching music at a high school. He's filled with hopes and dreams of his own, but the realities of life, large and small, affect him. Even though he has such a passion to strive for greatness of his own through composing and being a musician, his true passion comes out through his teaching. Again, truly how a teacher should be. Mr. Holland not only taught the values and essence in musical education, but the everyday, importnat values in life. He taught the values of determination and courage, like a shy and quiet girl trying her heart out to be great at playing the clarinet, or a distressed ex-football and ex-wrestler student how to play a bass drum. Simple little stuff; well, maybe not little, because as he syas "It takes a lot of work to learn a musical instrument." However, a little confidence and determination can go a long way. The different characters of certain students depicted in the film are just examples of how effective this teacher was. A great example is the senior girl who dreams of going to New York to become a famous singer. Mr. Holland realizes that there was truly someone who was passionate about something he could relate with. If it hadn't been for his confidence he instilled, she never would have gone on and pursued her dream. (It would have been nice to have known if she made it or not. Then again, I don't know if it's a true story, but we got to have a little imagination.) It's sad to know that because of some rotten budget, he was cut from his job along with the entire music and arts programs in the school near the end of the story. Still, even though we start to feel that it was all for what, his is a success story, as the generations and years of students who respond to his retirement, particularly the clarinet girl as she became the governor! It seems like all that drive and confidence to get to something like that all lead back to Mr. Holland. To me, there should be so many more teachers like that. Yes, "life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,"; it's true. It was in the students that he inspired and lead to success.

This two-disc set features two different versions of the '68 comeback special. Disc One offers the actual comeback special itself. Think of the televised special, if you've seen it, and remember how it was. This is the audio version. Disc Two is another show that was part of the special. If you've seen the &quot;One Night With You&quot; VHS or DVD, this is the audio version of it. Recommended if you enjoy this celebration of amilestone inElvis' career. It was called a &quot;comeback&quot; becuase he came back to live performances and television and trying to break away from making so many films in Hollywood. Here is the King at his prime, regaining the full attention of the world. This was only a precursor to &quot;Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite.&quot; The leather-clad King lives on!

"Tickle Me" might be underrated by movie censors, but it's funny, full of good songs, beautiful women, and some good fight scenes. Elvis is singing rodeo rider Lonnie Beale who, until the next rodeo season starts, is hired by Vera Radford (Julie Adams) who owns a spa/dude ranch called "Circle 'Z'". Lonnie takes an interest in the aerobics instructor Pam (Jocelyn Lane). Pam has a will that thugs are looking for because it is linked to $100,000 in gold left to her by her grandfather that is stored in a nearby ghost town. Lonnie is caught kissing the boss which upsets Pam. The next rodeo season begins. Lonnie can't keep it straight. After a long rodeo season, she still isn't speaking to him. Lonnie, Stanley (Jack Mullaney), and Pam end up at the ghost town and have to spen the night in the hotel. All night guys in goon masks, beast masks, a ghost in a rocker try to frighten away the hapless trio. They soon take down these thugs and learn they were from the ranch and were the suspicious ones. They find the money, and take down the sheriff who was behind it all. Lonnie and Pam marry in the end...with Stanley accidentally getting a free ride in the back of the jeep in the washtub. Elvis looks handsome and tough in "Tickle Me" and something you should see at least once. Go for more if you enjoy it!

This a smart marketing decision for RCA/BMG. Since the 25th anniversary of Elvis' death, a CD ought to be released. Now that it is, that was fantastic. This is a good starter for those discovering Elvis' music. I know this just came out and I don't own it (because I own all of these songs on separate CDs), but I predict this is going to sell big time! Sure, you can say that they're trying to copy "The Beatles 1". I really don't think. I'm not a Beatles fan. That CD had 27 songs, "ELV1S 30 #1 Hits" has got 30 plus the new remix of "A Little Less Conversation" which was a worldwide #1 hit. Elvis rules, and this CD shows why.

&quot;The Curse of the Pink Panther&quot; is not, by popular opinion, the best in the series. You can restrain yourslef from watching it. It'll probably make you feel better. Still, I could get a laugh or two out of it. Ted Wass as Clifton Sleigh is an exact repeat as Sellers as Clouseau. Interesting fight scene in this picture. David Niven as a better and larger role in this movie than in &quot;Trail&quot;. Him and Capucine return, along with arch-nemisis Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk as Cato. Harvey Korman returnsas well as Robert Loggia. If you have seen &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;, you could say that Ted Wass was retracing the steps of Joanna Lumley in &quot;Trail&quot;. Interesting part is in this picture is Clouseau's apartment has been turned into a museum. The &quot;Salty Sea Dog&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and all the other costumes and disguises Clouseau wore are on display. There is also a very wacky and hilarious car chase scene. You'll get the most laughs out of that sequence, because the taxi car rides upside down and skidding along down the road at one point. If it sounds interesting, go ahead and see for yourself. If not, don't bother.By popular opinion, it's not the greatest because Peter Sellers is missing. The man who &quot;supposedly&quot; plays Clouseau hiding-out is not very good. His accent is good, but he has no moustache and doesn't look a think like Peter Sellers. Herbert Lom even says near the end. &quot;Then that settles it. Clouseau is dead.&quot; Then, that raised a question to me: Is he or isn't he? Yeah, it's confusing. Not the greatest, but you can get a few laughs out of it.

"Ernest Saves Christmas" is one film I can't understand why is so underrated, and overlooked. TV Guide gives it one star which means poor. That's not right. Some film critics they are. I find this film very enjoyable and a must-see holiday film. Ernest (Jim Varney) with the help of Harmony Starr/Pamela Trenton (Noelle Parker) help retiring Santa (Douglas Seale) get beloved former kids' TV star (Oliver Clark) become the new Santa Claus before 7:00 PM on Christmas Eve. Ignore the underratings and take a shot at this beloved and cherishing film that remains timeless. MERRY CHRISTMAS!

"Bugs Bunny's Howl-Oween Special" is one hilarious cartoon telvision program. Great treat for young and old alike who love Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety, and that hair pin-losing witch Witch Hazel. I own it, and must have watched it over 40 times in the last 3 years. Hilarious when Witch Hazel turns into a vampire and Bugs says "Abra Cadabra" and the vampire becomes a bat, and Bugs doesn't realize it. Bugs is sitting up in bed, and sees the bat flying across close by. He says, "Golly! What big mosquitoes they have around here. Hold still, you little devil." He smashes it on the floor. The bat manages to get up and fly out of the window. Bugs, reading the book on magic words and phrases, says "Hocus Pocus". The bat transforms back into the vampire and falls into the water below. This is just a sample of the hilarity in this video. Sounds good? Why not? You'll be spooked up in far amounts...in hilarity, that is. HAPPY HALLOWEEN!

"A Day At The Rcaes" is excellent, and sometimes I enjoy it more than "A Night At The Opera". It has funny dialogue given, especially by Groucho, when he does the hilarious sequence with Chico as to what race horse he should bet on as he keeps buying more and more code books for a dollar to crack the code. When Chico places $6 on a particular horse, he's overelated. (He's supposed to be selling ice-cream). He's calling out "Get-a your tootsie fruitsie ice cream." When his horse wins, he collects a pile of money. The reason being is that he works at the Standish Sanitarium, run by Judy Standish (Maureen O'Sullivan), and the sanitarium is deeply in debt. Plus, Chico and Gil Stewart (Alan Jones) owe over a hundred dollars to the sheriff for a feed bill. It's up to Groucho, Chico, and Harpo to save the day despite many hystericaltwists and turns along the way. You'll enjoy it a lot, especially when Harpo begins to play the piano and bangs so hard on it he wrecks the whole piano piecemeal, and uses the strings of it to make himself a harp. He plays excellently as you see him take the music seriously until he goes back to acting crazy again! Cream of the crop classic!

Little Richard will always be the architecht of rock'n'roll! Alongside Elvis, Little Richard is at the top. I'm a teen and this is just about all I listen to with other 50s and 60s singers and groups! It starts it all off with, &quot;WOP-BOP-A-LOO-BOP-A-WOP-BAM-BOOM!&quot; Tutti Frutti, Long Tall Sally, Lucille, Good Golly Miss Molly. You name it, it has it. Great 20 songs from a pioneer who helped form rock'n'roll!

&quot;Trail&quot; is a whole mish-mosh of things. Including outtakes which are pretty hysterical. Peter Sellers was a master. Quite disapointing that this was the first Pink Panther film I saw. The first half of the film was all right, but the second half it's kind of bland. David Niven's role has been reduced to almost a cameo part. He's so old, and Rich Little is dubbing his voice. A little on the bland side at some points, but I can get a few laughs out of it. We'll miss you, Peter!

How do you cover an artist with nearly 50 years worth of recorded materialon one disc? Use this as an example. With so many different collections of artists like Ms. Etta James out there, it can be a complicated task of what to choose. Others may focus on one particular area of her recording career, but this one goes all the way back to her 1955 smash of "The Wallflower (Dance With Me Henry)" all the way up to a 2004 recording of a blues recording "The Sky Is Crying" in which her sons take part in the production. Many of the well known Argo/Cadet sides from the '60s are represented like "At Last", "Something's Got A Hold On Me", and "Tell Mama" and then moving on to her gutsy and gritty rendition of "Take It To The Limit" from 1978, which was so chilling and moving, and ending up in the '80s and '90s with some Nashville recordings containing a country tinge to them as well as a Gershwin tune "The Man I Love", and Otis Redding's "I've Been Loving You Too Long." Etta had such a versatile style from cool, refined, and seductive to passionate, gutsy and rollicking. If only some young female singers today could take a lesson from her; she could do it all, and is still doing it today. That's why this package can do wonders for somebody who wants to know which great artists from the past are still performing today and wants to see a dynamic balance and mix of different material in a career-spanning perspective. This one certainly has it. With so much material from her earlier years, some things may be missing, but as stated before, with one disc in a complete career overview theme in mind, the debate rests on what really is essential in representing the artist's entire career. All 23 tunes are very enjoyable. If you're new to Etta, this a great place to start.

Sidney Poitier is outstanding and this is one of his best movies. The music is excellent, the acting is excellent, and the storyline is excellent. &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot; looks and sounds great in this remastered edition. This is calling to all of you people who haven't seen this picture in ages. I know you'll still enjoy it.

"Knock On Wood", "Soul Man", "Gee Whiz", "Green Onions,""Last Night", "Hold On I'm Comin'", "Walkin' The Dog" and"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay." What do all these songs have in common? Sure, they're great soul and rhythm & blues tunes, but something more. What do Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Sam & Dave, Eddie Floyd, Otis Redding and Albert King have in common? Rhythm & blues and soul superstars, yes, but that same something is also true. These songs and these artists all recorded for the "little label that could": STAX. In the '60s, Stax became a local R&B; music giant in Memphis. The company was founded and ran by Jim Stewart, a country fiddle player and former banker, who was first exposed to R&B; when he recorded a local doo-wop group called the Veltones with their song, "Fool In Love." As Rufus Thomas a local disc jockey heard the song, he and daughter Carla cut "Cause I Love You", a great R&B; gem for Jim. When the record got out, Atlantic Records heard this fresh new sound and got in on the distribution deal with Stax that would exist as a handshake deal to a documented deal up until May 1968. What also happened during that time? Musical history.At nine CDs, this set offers the complete history of what made Stax absolutely phenomenal. As you listen all the waythrough, hopefully not all in one sitting since it's quite exhaustive unless you end up loving it that much, you'll notice as you start from disc one the experimental stages at trying to find and develop a distinct sound and progressing towards it. Some of the songs on disc four display it and from there on all the way to disc nine, it's there and ever-driving as can be. This is the ultimate example at what a box set is all about: covering as much material as possible. That doesn't even begin to describe what's presented here; it's too good because it is what it is: complete. There are 244 tracks in all and each CD has 25+ tracks clocking in with 70+ minutes of music on each.It's complete all right for it features every A-side released by Stax and the subsidiary Volt along with a few well-known B-sides. That means every Stax or Volt record released by the stars like Rufus Thomas, ("Walkin' The Dog", "Can Your Monkey Do The Dog", "Jump Back", "Sophisticated Sissy", etc.), Carla Thomas ("Gee Whiz", "B-A-B-Y", "Stop! Look What You're Doin'", "Pick Up The Pieces", etc.), Otis Redding ("These Arms of Mine", "Mr. Pitiful", "Respect", "Try a Little Tenderness", etc.), Booker T. & the MGs ("Green Onions", "Jelly Bread", "My Sweet Potato", "Hip-Hug Her", etc.), Sam & Dave ("You Don't Know Like I Know", "Hold On! I'm Comin', "When Something Is Wrong With My Baby", "Soul Man", etc.), Eddie Floyd ("Things Get Better", "Knock On Wood", "Raise Your Hand", "Big Bird", etc.), William Bell ("You Don't Miss Your Water", "Never Like This Before", "Share What You Got", "Eloise Hang On In There", etc.), Albert King ("Laundromat Blues", "Crosscut Saw", "Born Under A Bad Sign", "Cold Feet", etc.) plus so many, many more. So if you know that those artists who were very consistent at Stax, there's pratically a full CD's worth of their songs here spread throughout the nine discs. Whether they were hits or not, everything is here including some unusual numbers that seem to break the normal Stax scheme like Macy Skipper's "Goofin' Off" which is humorous dee-jay kind of track, Cheryl and Pam Johnson's "That's My Guy", which sounds like a show-bizzy, TV commercial kind of tune, Nick Charles' "Sunday Jealous" and "The Three Dogwoods" which sound like soft, dry pop songs of that era,and the Del-Rays' "Don't Let Her Be Your Baby" which tries to emulate the Beatles or the Dave Clark Five. This has got everything, so calling all collectors! It comes with a little 80-page book that could be worth about $15 separately so getting this with music is a bargain. The book has liner notes about the artits, the music, some real nice photos of the stars plus a track by track listing including the original catalog number and chart position (for those applicable) for each song.Is it worth it? Absoultely. Pricey, but worth it. Finding this kind of music is getting rarer and rarer. Especially considering that about less than of these tracks didn't chart at all. Sure, the well-known hits can be found on smaller collections. This is the only collection that I know that has all the other stuff with it. Don't worry about parting with that kind of money. Being a musician and music fan, I can't think of a better investment, and if it's something you really enjoy, that makes it even more worthwhile. Here they are preserved on CD forever.It's more than music to listen to. It's music you can dance to and groove to. Just listen to the sizzlin' guitars, the deep, pumping bass, the tight drums, the soulfulness of the vocalists and just the whole formula of each song. The sound quality is not good...it's perfect! Though everything is in big fat mono, since these were from the master tapes used on the original 45s (hence "singles" in the name), the sound is crisp and crystal clear. It sounds amazing on a system with adjustable bass output. Just crank that bass up, baby; it's practically what makes R&B.; Every song is worth listening to for they help tell the story of Stax. They are all little gems. If a record didn't chart at all or it charted very low, so what? These people made music at leisurely paces and were great improvisers and just wanted to get out there, jam and do their own thing. If it sold and it was a hit, fantastic. If not, well, it was worth a shot. There is a good balance of the fast songs as well as the slow ballads. These are practically the unsung heroes of soul music; absoultely raw, gritty, rock-solid, vital and energetic they were. It was the opposite of Motown, their seemingly unbeatable giant of a competitor that was more slick and stylized in soul music. What's important lies in the musicality of the musicians and singers. Truly, this is what soul music is all about; it tells a story and expresses every human being's innermost and outermost feelings. Musicians can learn so much from this, for everyone involved here shows true musicianship. The thing was to make people appreciate and, yes, make them move to it. You can laugh with it, cry with it, and feel absolutely "soulified." It could make everyone, young and old, black and white, get up and dance and throw their cares away. It didn't matter what they were singing like Rufus Thomas on songs that have silly-sounding titles or lyrics like "Somebody Stole My Dog", or "I Think I Made A Boo Boo", you can just get up and let the driving music move you. You can laugh, but you'll find that you're laughing because it makes you feel good. So, they weren't Dylan or Lennon & McCartney. One listen to this entire set is all it takes, and you're hooked. Give this to a six year old and he or she will be a fan for life. Really, you'll never get tired of this music. The '60s were a time of social change and civil rights awareness. If only this music could have been more well-known and all these songs could have been hits, this would have brought everyone together to dance the day and night away. There's nothing like soul music. What more is there to say except that if you would like to have just one box set for your music collection, you just found a gold mine. That being said, if American music was the equivalent of a jewelry collection, all these songs would be the rare, precious and priceless gems.So, to quote from a Mar-Keys' song, "grab this thing" because you'll want to keep it forever. It is thee essential and complete relevance of why Stax was the "little label that could"...and did!

You know, every Christmas, we often think we're going to hear the same stuff cranked out every year; same traditional pop Christmas numbers. That's all well and good, and I've nothing against it, but why not put a little soul into it? This is quite an interesting album that features the all-time classic "White Christmas" of Clyde McPhatter/The Drifters. Plus, among the others are cuts from the original 1968 "Soul Christmas" album like Carla Thomas' "Gee Whiz, It's Christmas" and "All I Want For Christmas Is You", Clarence Carter's super-grooving bass-heavy "Back Door Santa", Booker T. and the MG's "Merry Christmas Baby (Otis Redding's is here also and with his soully impassioned version of "White Christmas"), and "Silver Bells". There are also some cuts from another album from 1976 called "Funky Christmas" that includes Luther Vandross' "May Christmas Bring You Happiness" and a remix of it (love both), the Impressions' gospel-like "Silent Night" (wonderful; one of the best I heard), and Margie Joseph's little gem "Christmas Gift." Other tracks here and there include Donny Hathaway's groovy horn-driven "This Christmas", Joe Tex's organ-drenched ballad "I'll Make Every Day Christmas For My Woman", Brook Benton's soulful "Soul Santa" as well as the Sweet Inspirations' gospelly "Every Day Will Be Like a Holiday." Looking forward to New Year's is taken into consideration with Otis & Carla's "New Year's Resolution" as well as King Curtis on "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?" Every bit inspirational and every bit of fun with a whole lot of soul to make your holidays shine.

...the Blues Brothers! Well, here they are showing you what they can do best and what they love most: keeping alive forever the legacy of blues and soul music. John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd tooktheir Saturday Night Live skit and turned it into an actual bandbacked up with some of the most revered horn and rhythm section members ever from guitarist Steve Cropper and bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn of Booker T. & the MG's (no wonder it sounded so good), Matt "Guitar" Murphy, who often gave Chuck Berry a hand, and a knockout brass section with Alan "Mr. Fabulous" Rubin on trumpet, sax player Lou Marini, and trombonist Tom "Bones" Malone. The disc is like one unforgettable concert spawning tracks from their two albums and the movie soundtrack.Songs like their opening "I Can't Turn You Loose", "Rubber Biscuit" with Elwood on lead vocal (hilarious), "Soul Man" "Who's Makin' Love", "Everybody Needs Someone To Love", "Sweet Home Chicago", "Expressway to Your Heart" among others. You'll really enjoy how the band performs the songs andhow together the sound is. These guys had it! Also in the mix you'll find the two songs from the film backed up by the band: "Shake Your Tailfeather" with Ray Charles, and "Think" with Aretha Franklin. If there was one great blues revival band, the Blues Brothers were it.

"Clambake" was a film that Elvis had total disinterest in doing. Actually, this film is fun to watch and every Elvis fan should take the time to watch it. Probably the only reason was that the ever-lasting chain of musical comedies was getting tiresome and old. Bill Bixby is Elvis' rival. Elvis delivers him with a sucker punch and Bixby is out cold. Elvis is an unhappy-with-money millionaire's son who switches places with Will Hutchins, a poor water-skiing instructor. Elvis takes interest in third-time Elvis costar Shelley Fabares. If you want to see a zany Elvis picture, this is the one.

&quot;Love Me Tender&quot; was a complete success when it first came to theaters November 15, 1956. The love triangle in this story is one-in-a-million! Elvis does such good acting in this picture that some fans could consider it his finest acting...and it's only his first movie! Elvis does four songs in the picture: &quot;We're Gonna Move&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, &quot;Let Me&quot;, and &quot;Poor Boy.&quot; Although &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; is set after the Civil War the songs Elvis sings are closely related to rock'n'roll. Very disappointing when Elvis' character dies near the end. Elvis' mother did not like that at all. I cried when Elvis' character dies, and after the family walks solemnly away from his grave there is a ghostly close-up of Elvis singing &quot;Love Me Tender.&quot; I was shocked, and cried at this! Elvis fans, if you want something a little more uplifting, try &quot;Loving You.&quot; Elvis didn't like when he did the songs in &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; because his band wasn't there with him on-screen.

Imagine what Howlin' Wolf was thinking when Koko Taylor came along and just belted out the Willie Dixon-penned classic that he once had done himself. Her take on it was obviously without peer as it has gained legendary status and became her signature tune. It was all thanks to Willie Dixon, the blues master at Chess Records, who turned Koko Taylor into the Queen of Chicago Blues by providing with her excellent material (his songwriting credit dominates this album) and even backing her up vocally on "Wang Dang Doodle" and the wailing, heartfelt "Insane Asylum".Those who dismiss the blues as music that just brings you even more down in the dumps than you already are should give Koko Taylor a try. You'll soon be pattin' your feet or even dancin' around soon enough. She just roars with a fire in her voice through each of these songs so that you can't help but be entranced by it, if not also by the phenomenal group of backing musicians like Buddy Guy, Matt Murphy, Sunnyland Slim, Daddy G, as well as Willie Dixon. Koko Taylor got her start at the perfect place and was already on her way when she departed from Chess, and Willie Dixon seemed to be the one person who was the biggest help as he wrote most of the songs here, played bass, sung some duets and not to mention produced this album. What a great mentor!This is a reissue of the 1969 album that comprises all of Koko's best material from '65-'69. Two never-before released tracks ("Love Sick Tears" and "He Always Knocks Me Out") are presented to extend the album...somewhat. It would have been even more impressive if there 20 here and include famous tracks not present like "What Kind of Man Is This." So this album might be too short for numerous-song enthusiasts as it clocks in just under 40 minutes. It seems though that this is the only album that contains the material from that era.If you're looking at the original album without the bonus tracks, don't be misled with the link to the "Chess Years" compilation; it took me back to Amazon's home page, so apparently that album is not available anywhere on here. However, this a decent set showing how Koko Taylor got to be Queen of Chicago Blues at no better place and with no better musician: Chess and Willie Dixon.

Stax Records had such an incredible history in one of the most important eras of 20th century popular music in America. Starting out as a country/pop oriented label by a country fiddle player turned into an R&B powerhouse. Located in Memphis, Tennessee, it was ripe. Artists such as Carla Thomas, Rufus Thomas, Otis Redding, Booker T. & the MG's (the Stax house band along with the Mar-Keys), Albert King, Sam & Dave among others recorded with the label during the '60s when Atlantic distributed the label. Those were the label's glory days and had they continued with Atlantic when that company was bought by Warner in 1967/8, Stax could have lasted much longer. From 1968 to 1975, the second half of Stax's history saw drastic changes in the activity at Stax, both musically and personally. Johnnie Taylor, the Staple Singers, the Soul Children and Isaac Hayes and many others thrived on the music charts. Other than Volt, Stax spawned more subsidiary labels like Enterprise, Partee and Truth. The label with a new logo was being distributed at first by Gulf-Western, then bought back and then finally with CBS which led to Stax's ultimate demise. Much financial difficulty too long to get into brought Stax's downfall in 1975. It's such a shame that Stax is seeming to get less and less attention, partcularly nowadays as this kind of music is increasingly disappearing from oldies and mix radio stations. Motown was practically the big competitor for Stax. Motown had a polished sound, while Stax had a more tougher and freer sound. It seemed that during Stax's golden days, they made such quality-filled music though their record sales couldn't fully complete with Motown. If the attitude of making good music up front would have been held first and foremost, Stax could have lasted so much longer. This book is an in-depth and very informative read about the history of Stax.

What can be said about the dynamic (big understatement) impact that Aretha Franklin has had on not only R&B;/soul music but music in general? Words simply cannot express what music can in every essence. In her recordings, both in the studio and live, her story was told. With an inherent gospel fervor, she had brought the Church mainstream to make what Al Green refers secular music as "people's music," and like many before and since her, Aretha had topped them all. The bedrock of R&B; is gospel and Aretha had never let that aspect be skewed. With her gospel piano-playing and musicianship backed by the mighty Muscle Shoals band, every ingredient was there to present that down-to-earth yet gutsy and soulful southern R&B; sound. That was Aretha in her prime at Atlantic records.Spanning four discs at 86 tracks, this may as well be THE Aretha set to own. All of her hit songs are here, plus many great album cuts and B-sides. Naming songs here is not essential, because if you can think of one or a few, they're likely to be there. Like all box sets, the material thins out somewhat at the end so that the latter end of the era covered is close to being scant. The last song is "Something He Can Feel" recorded in 1976, yet Aretha was with Atlantic for three more years. By that time, however, her records were charting lower and lower and were not altogether that memorable. Nevertheless, this is a very strong set complete with what'd you'd expect from a decade's worth of Aretha's prime material.Included is a great booklet with great liner notes, numerous photos, quotes, discography, chart information, track by track annotation featuring recording and release dates and sessionography.Anybody who is at least 10 years of age should know about Aretha Franklin and perhaps be encouraged to investigate further into this superb musical genre. Having recently seen her in concert three months ago in Baltimore, it can be said that she is still going strong and still does not fail to wow and engage an audience in such a captivating manner.There will never be another Queen of Soul; it is only Aretha Franklin!

...which is where most of the film is set, but, hey, I'm not complaining. Funny all over, and full of pranks, gags and numerous punchlines. Although this film does not fature Chico and Harpo displaying their musical talents, it still gets a lot of laughs the way they scheme to get the play at the hotel theatre together. This is a great classic!

It was indeed tragic that we lost Otis at such a young age and at the height of a dynamic career. It's another shame, as I've read in the liner notes, that when he died the pop audience hardly knew him. It was that same old "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay" that kept getting played and played. That's now his singature song for pop fans. For R&B fans, it's either "Try A Little Tenderness", check that out: starts real low and smooth and then builds and Otis really cuts loose, or there is the original "Respect". That song is hot stuff; it has a jumpy beat, dynamic bass and sax spots yet this song is so criminally ignored. Sure, Aretha hit it big with it, but let's give credit where it's due. The rest of this album rocks with a lot of soul. His duet with Carla Thomas on "Tramp" is here also with Carla criticizing Otis of his hobo looks. They should've done more duets together like Marvin and Tammi. Too bad the duet of "Knock On Wood" isn't on here, but on this it looks like the bigger of the two hits was chosen. Just hearing Otis will make you a soul/R&B fan instantly.

&quot;Harvey&quot; is one of THE best classics made. Great and superbcomic acting from Josephine Hull. She is wonderful. No wonder she got the Academy Award. Jimmy Stewart is marvelous. What would have been great was at the end, when Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd walks away from the sanitarium gats and down the road on the hill, they could have shown like a ghostly image of a rabbit to show the audience that the rabbit was there all the time. I was waiting for that to happen when I first saw it, but never did and I thought &quot;Gee, that's disappointing.&quot; That didn't stop me from watching it countless times. I love it, and it's a greatway to relax from a hard day.

If you have bought &quot;Only Rock'N Roll: 1955-1959 #1 Radio Hits&quot; and thought it was the best, (so do I), why not get this one as well. On this CD are some of the best selling songs of the '50s. All of them made the Top 20 and many reached #1. Such hits like &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; (25 weeks at #1 in 1955), Maybellene (#2 in 1955), Peggy Sue (#3 in 1957), The Great Pretender (#1 in 1958), Wake Up Little Susie (#1 in 1957), Donna (#2 in 1958), and At The Hop (#1 in 1958) will have you rockin' and rollin' all day and all night, baby! I highly reccommend this one to '50s rock'n roll fans, and to people who are my age that love this as well. I'm only 14 but I think this is tops! This rocks all the way, baby!

Before I start commenting on this item, I have to disagree to the title ... gave it. It's not "Should be #1 Radio Hits" it's "Definetly #1 Radio Hits". This CD rocks big time, baby. You'll never grow tired of it once you first listen to it. It's filled with chart-topping rockin' and rollin' songs. Play this music along with the other "Only Rock 'N Roll" titles at dance parties, family reunions, wedding parties, in the car, or anywhere. I'm 14 years old and this is before my time, but I love it. I sing along with it every time. I don't care if my classmates say I'm livin' in another era. All they listen to is that goofy rap music with inappropriate lyrics. This is pure music. If you love oldies and early '60s music, you're gonna love this. I definetly gaurantee it!

If you are a rock fan, and you love '50s rock'n roll, I highly recommend this CD. You'll be rockin' and rollin' yourself to death, baby! If you'd like, buy the other Only Rock'N Roll '50s CDs. Just type in Only Rock'N Roll: 1955-1959 (Series) and buy that one as well. This is the best, man! I'm just nearly 14 and this music is way before my time, but I love the '50s music. Face it, I was born too late. This is a whole lot better than that trash and stupid stuff they're recording today. Who cares if someone thinks you are listening to &quot;out-of-date&quot; music? This CD rocks! Oh, mercy!

&quot;Elvis Presley&quot;. A simple title to a distinct and unique first album hit #1 in 1956 and remained in that position for 10 weeks! The first LP to go gold, also. This is an absolute essential gem from early rock'n'roll. Great upgrading from RCA by adding &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and its B-side top 20 &quot;I Was The One&quot;. &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, &quot;I'm Counting On You&quot; (nice sounding), &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, and more! A mix of rockabilly and ballads, but still sure is fantastic. I highly recommend this to any Elvis fan!

&quot;Animusic&quot; stunned me the first time I had seen it! I kept seeing the &quot;Future Retro&quot; being shown over and over on TV along with the &quot;Aqua Harp&quot;. I was amazed. My favorite music video on this DVD is &quot;Stick Figures.&quot; There is the bass guitar with arms playing itself as you see on the front cover. It makes an awesome sound. As Wayne Lytle said in the commentary on this DVD, at first you might laugh and then say &quot;Wow, that's pretty neat.&quot; He also said that some people called that &quot;Mr. Bass Man.&quot; It's more than neat! It rocks all the way baby. Such neat details in all instruments. The instruments play themselves with such unbelievable realism. Neat colors, lighting, score, rhythm, and syncopation all the way! Here is how I rank the music videos with 1 being the best:1. Stick Figures2. Future Retro3. Drum Machine4. Pipe Dream5. Acoustic Curves6. Aqua Harp7. Harmonic VoltageIf you agree with me or not on my choices you will agree they are all splendiferously superb! I reccommed this to anybody who loves computer animation and music, and to the people who don't and see what they think! This needs more recognition. Thank goodness for Animusic!

This is another installment in the releases of the Garfield TV specials onto state-of-the-art DVD. This an absoulte must for collectors and Garfield enthusiasts, no doubt. "Garfield In The Rough" find the fat cat, Odie and Jon out camping where they encounter a hungry panther. Check out the literally "colorless life" of Grafield at the beginning. That's kind of neat. Next, is my personal favorite: "Garfield in Paradise." The trio are on an all-gone-wrong vacation until they rent a hot '57 Chevy convertible, meet the tribe that worships the car, headed by a Chief voiced by Wolfman Jack, and the car's legend that can appease the island's volcano. "Garfield Goes Hollywood" finds Jon, Garfield and Odie as Jonny Bop and the Two-Steps when they win a local talent contest and then hit the big time in Hollywood where they meet some stiff competition. What more is there to say? I'm personally glad "Garfield in Paradise" is back in print and on DVD. That one is probably the best of the three.It's a must! Forever Garfield!

Garfield has made me laugh for years. I was so glad that this show aired again a few years ago, because since then it hasn't been on TV since. Garfield gets his Halloween inspiration to trick-or-treat from that "awful clown" Binky. The next morning he wakes up saying, "Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY, CANDY! Hello, Halloween! What a glorious day and a glorious night to go trick-or-treating...for candy, candy, candy, candy, CANDY!" He and Odie, who gets the inspiration passed from Garfield, pick out their costumes for the night. They dress as swash-buckling buccaneers. After a sucessful night, they discover a dock on a lake with a small lifeboat attached to the boat. They sail across the lake. After sialing into a patch of fog, Garfield realizes they're lost and wants to go back home. Suddenly, land ho! They discover a rickety old mansion. As they quietly make their way inside and sit by the fire, they turn around and see a spooky-looking and mysterious old man seated in a chair. He tells them of an old pirate legend about how 100 years ago on that night they buried treasure somwhere on that island, and 100 years later they would return to get it...even if it meant returning from the grave! Garfield and Odie decide to leave and notice the man is gone. Out of the house they run and see the old man stole their boat. At midnight, an eerie looking ghost pirate ship arrives. Close-ups with pirate ghosts and escaping adventure as Garfield and Odie evacuate the mansion, swim the lake back to the other side. They see their boat, and leave with their candy. Back home , they each get their share of the candy. Garfield turns on the TV and sees the old man saying in an Alfred Hitchcock voice, "Good evening, and welcome to the all-night pirate movie festival." Garfield turnd it off saying, "Boy, am I tired." He lays down and says in his pirate voice "Arrr..." It's no trick, but it's one Halloween treat. "Garfield's Halloween Adventure" will spook you, make you laugh, and you'll never regret seeing it.

I have watched "Garfield's Thanksgiving" every year at Thanksgiving and I never grow tired of it. It's funnier than any other Thanksgiving cartoon show ever. Here in this cute and top-notch cartoon show, Jon and Garfield have a successful shopping trip to prepare for Thanksgiving. Then they have to go to THE VET! Garfield is so tensed up, that Liz, the vet, says that Garfield has to go on a diet while Jon tries to break a date with Liz in an unusual way: he holds his breath until she says she'll go out with him. He held out pretty long. The diet is torture for Garfield, but Jon can't wait for the next day. Get this. When he's about to pull everything he needs the next morning, he takes out everything from underneath the counter including the turkey itself. That counter must have a miniature fridge and everything down there. He sets the oven at 500 degrees. That's broil! It all turns out well, before Jon ruins the whole meal, but it's Grandma to the rescue. Jon tries to stall Liz off by telling her about what countires call their Thanksgiving and the whole history. Grandma is busy in the kitchen and ready to preare the table. That is quick work. It's a nice dinner scene in there, and it sort of warms you. Don't miss this Thanksgiving treat that should include a stuffed turkey. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

Ray Charles at Atlantic is where it all began in the recording career. These songs are mixtures of jazz, blues, jump blues, and R&B. Listen to "It Should've Been Me" and "Greenbacks" and you'll hear Ray talk the lyrics with the band responding after each stanza before he'll sing the chorus with the band backing him up. "This Little Girl of Mine" is peppy and will put a smile on your face: "...and that's why I, I, I, I, ohh, love that little girl of mine." Classic stuff, indeed. Get bluesy with "It's All Right", "Lonely Avenue, and "That's Enough". Of course there are the immortal "I've Got A Woman" and "What'd I Say." Pop fans beware because this was the part of Ray's career where he was hitting big on the R&B scene but yet to get attention from pop audiences. You won't find "Hit The Road, Jack" here. Look elsewhere. If you're willing to give this a try, you won't be disappointed. Long live Brother Ray!

Atlantic Records was one of the country's leading record companies in rhythm & blues and soul music. Here, in collaboration with Rhino Records, 16 rare tunes are presented froim artists like Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, Donny Hathaway, Arthur Conley, plus some rarely heard artists as well. Some of these songs have never made it past being only released on the original 45, and others have never been heard before, period. These songs come from about 1967-1974; one of the last of the golden ages at Atlantic. This disc runs about 50 minutes, but is very enjoyable. Definitely worth hearing, because it's not something you'd hear every day. One listen to the whole thing, and you'd be asking why some of these songs never saw the light of day again...until now!Wilson Pickett: Can't Stop a Man In LoveLots of energy and a good beat in this one. The background vocalists are good.Bobby Womack: How Does It FeelThe organ and bass make this song; good beat to it.Sam & Dave: You Left the Water RunningGood funky stuff from these guys; great drumbeat.Arthur Conley: Rome Wasn't Built In A DaySeminal track featuring a sharp horn line at the beginning and near the end of the song.Percy Wiggins: Book of MemoriesThis would have been a good hit; nice easy soul ballad with a very audible classic sounding bass line.The Soul Clan: That's How It FeelsDynamite soul talents Arthur Conley, Ben E. King, Solomon Burke, Don Covay and Joe Tex team up to deliver this very heartfelt song.Otis Redding: I Love You More Than Words Can SayWhat's a soul collection without Big O? There'd be something wrong with any woman who can't feel this guy's heartwrenching plea.Percy Sledge: Baby, Baby, BabyPercy does a beautiful job with this organ-drenched rendition of the Aretha Franklin ballad. It features a good horn part in place of the backing vocals.James Carr: Hold OnHis only Atlantic single is a moderate tempo ballad that is as every bit as touching.Otis Clay: Pouring Water on a Drowning ManHave mercy! This guy's telling it like it is; passionate soulful performance on this one.Mighty Sam: LovebonesStill has that Johnnie Taylor spirit about it. Great organ parts and solos. Listen as he compliments his fellow Atlantic artists near the end.Darrell Banks: The Love of My WomanConfident sounding uptempo number from thsi rarely heard artist.Walter Jackson: Coldest Days of My Life:Beautiful slow, soul ballad that features a great bass guitar part especially during the chorus part. Love how the backing vocals spice up this song well.R.B. Greaves: Whiter Shade of PaleNeat B Major-keyed rendition of this classic song featuring a terrific organ part and backing vocals.Carl Hall: Change With the Seasons.Can this guy belt it out! As ultra-soulful as it get can possibly get.Donny Hathaway: What A Woman Really MeansSounds very modern and really way ahead of its time. Listen to Donny's vocal stylings and how the male backing vocals sound and you'll know.Be sure to check out the "Soul Sisters" volume as well. For fans of classic soul, it's a must!

Atlantic Records was one of the country's leading record companies in rhythm & blues and soul music. Here, in collaboration with Rhino Records, 16 rare tunes are presented froim artists like Aretha Franklin, Barbara Lewis, Margie Joseph, Doris Troy, The Sweet Inspirations, Jackie Moore, plus some rarely heard artists as well. Some of these songs have never made it past being only released on the original 45, and others have never been heard before, period. These songs come from about 1964-1973; one of the last of the golden ages at Atlantic. This disc runs about 50 minutes, but is very enjoyable. Definitely worth hearing, because it's not something you'd hear every day. One listen to the whole thing, and you'd be asking why some of these songs never saw the light of day again...until now!Aretha Franklin: My WayWhy this was only issued overseas is anybody's guess. She wasn't trying to put Frank Sinatra to shame; just her own personal take on it...and a mighty dang good one!Margie Joseph: It's GrowingA nice, easy-tempoed drum and bass-laiden cover of an early Temptations' record. She adds a cool touch too it with her silky-smooth voice.Patti LaBelle and the Bluebells: Count the DaysA solid track; could have been a great hit because it sounds like it had some potential. The bells and piano at the beginning set the stage before the bass and drums come in with a solid groove.Doris Troy: Please Little Angel"Just One Look" wasn't all. This cute-sounding number is quite enjoyable. Very dated, I must say; has a good '60s feel to it.Mary Wells: Hands Off My BabyMary Wells after Motown continued to sing and be around Motown-like material. Somehow it just didn't quite cut it with her at Atlantic. This would have made a nice hit for her; love the congas and vibes at the beginning.Dee Dee Sharp: My Best Friend's ManEven Miss "Mashed Potato Time" got to work with Atlantic. In this sentimental-sounding track, you can't help but have pity on her.Dee Dee Warwick: Rescue MeThis cover of the Fontella Bass classic has a great rhythmic drive too it, but somehow that same energy just isn't there. It sounds good in its own respect, but isn't quite the same.Baby Washington: What Becomes of the BrokenheartedThis cover, on the other hand, rivals Jimmy Ruffin's original closely. She has a good contralto tone.Irma Thomas: Full Time WomanThe melody felt like it existed forever; a real poignant-sounding ballad.Judy Clay: I've Got To Love Somebody's BabyIt sounds like something you'd hear in one of those late-night dimly lit blues clubs. Johnnie Taylor originally did it at Stax some years before; exquisite cover.Esther Phillips: Cheater ManDefinitely, could have been a huge hit. Esther's nasally voice, a rock solid groove and some great lyrics made a perfect combination. The producrs on this track are the same ones who worked with the blue-eyed soul group, the BoxTops.Laura Lee: What A ManIt has a lost classic touch to it. The horn section and backing vocals reflect that. Laura Lee was a gospel singer, and she carries that over fully in this upbeat number.The Sweet Inspirations: Ain't Nothing Gonna Change MeThis is every bit of a gospel-like number. Everything they do in here is so cool from singing in unison to the call and response with the lead singer. Very righteous!Jackie Moore: It Ain't Who You KnowListen to the first few notes that Jackie sings, and wonder where else you've heard a similar sounding melody. A great, easy to listen to number. Backing vocals are silky-smooth.Bettye Swann: I Ain't That Easy To LosePerhaps a perfectly produced and orchestrated record. From the wah-wah guitar to the rapid-fire drums to the added effects with the woodwinds and strings and to the call and response backing vocals at the chorus with Bettye's mellow voice.Barbara Lewis: Thankful For What I GotIt's just how you will feel after absorbing these lost treasures. This track has an easy yet bouncy swing to it, and the backing vocals are fantastic sounding at the end of the chorus when they're basically saying "Ditto what Barbara says."This compilation, along with the "Soul Brothers" volume, makes a great addition to any soul music lover's library.

&quot;Pot Luck&quot; is an Elvis CD I've been playing constantly and is great to listen to. More romance than rock, Elvis can still prove he has that great talent. &quot;Kiss Me Quick&quot; is the best of the whole package. If you're a fan, it's a must.

This was Elvis' second album that was released. It went to #1 on the album charts, and went gold. Now that RCA has brought it back and added extra tracks, it's better than ever! I fell in love with these songs ever since I first heard them! I'm 14 and love Elvis, and this is part of Elvis' definitive music! I know you'll love this CD too when you hear it.

If you love oldies music and you love rock 'n roll and dance music, get this great album. You'll play this over and over once you hear it. It starts with Fats Domino's "I'm Walkin'". Boy is that fast. Another one of my favorite songs on hear is "Short Fat Fannie". You'll never get tired of this! ....If any of you younger people out who are something like 14 like me and if you love this kind of music, even if your friends think it's what one of my classmates call it "ancient" or "out-of-date", get this album and show your friends what real music is. I hardly think this music is ancient. All songs are digitally mastered. You're gonna love this, man!

What is Motown all about? The answer lies within the music of this rather impressive line-up of songs on "Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection 1959-1971." It's the story of how a gifted songwriter, Berry Gordy, Jr., makes his way on up the ladder of success spearheading one of if not the most successfulof all R&B-based; record companies during the golden age of American popular music. Detroit, Michigan, known as the Motor City, gained yet another nickname: Hitsville USA. Everyone referred to it as Motown. In this collection, all of the well-known groups (The Supremes, The Temptations, The Four Tops, The Miracles, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, The Jackson 5) are represented as well as the known solo artists (Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Mary Wells, Brenda Holloway). Included also are some wonderful one or two-shot wonders (Shorty Long, Brenda Holloway, Eddie Holland [of Motown's hit-making songwriting trio H-D-H], The Velvelettes, The Elgins, The Monitors, The Contours) and more. What's interesting about this set is that there are many of the well-known songs along with some songs that you probably just don't hear anymore or weren't that well-known. So you get your fair share of both like the Supremes' well-known "Baby Love" and Shorty Long's rare but wonderful "Function at the Junction." The downside of this set is nothing too alarming. Not all the artists' hit songs, big and small, are included and I think that's done so that other little-known-but-definitely-worth-discovering are given a chance at spin time, too; even some from the top artists, too. Think about it: if every single Motown record that made the charts was included, this collection would just balloon up, and there'd be no telling how far. So this is a very nice general overview of those first 12 and golden years of Motown. That's what this is all about: the general overview. Granted, if you want to investiagte further about a certain artist's music, there are numerous collections out there devoted just to them like the single "Ultimate Collection" CDs, or box collections of the artist. But, back to this one. Included within is a very nice 68-page booklet containing essays and phots of ALL the artists, plus musician credits, the track-by-track listing of the whole set, including original release date, label, and chart position.In the middle of the book the different 45s are pictured all together on a two-page spread which was neat, and on the cover are the picture sleeves. It was an unusual move to put no artists and only songs on the back of the individual discs. The same goes for the back of the box. The paper inserts of the CD cases are record labels that have just the label name: Gordy, Soul, Motown, Tamla. Still, out of all the Motown best of various artists collections, this is the big one! It's great party music and dance music. People young and old will love this. The sound on here is terrific and powerful, but, yes, it is in mono. If you look in the back of the booklet, there is noted that the original single masters were used (the 45 RPM versions), so what does that tell you? Nevertheless, the sound is strong for 1992 remastering. Together, this set is living proof that Motown wasn't just a hit-making machine of a record-company, it was a feeling!

This case reshapes the lives of Macy's employee Maureen O'Hara and daughter Natalie Wood. It is a truly magical and inspiring Christmas film that never ages which is perfect for future generations.

Gary Busey fantastically portrays Buddy Holly and about his unfortunately short but super-incredible career. Some of the charcter's names and some events have been cahnged, but that's n reason not to enjoy this wonderful story of a rock'n'roll legend.Busey recreates Holly's greatest hit songs such as &quot;That'll Be The Day, &quot;Rave On&quot;, &quot;Rock Around With Ollie Vee&quot;, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, &quot;Oh Boy&quot;, &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Words of Love&quot;, and &quot;True Love Ways&quot;. The final moments are chilling, but the storytelling is incredible. Buddy Holly is gone, but not forgotten and Gary Busey proves that here in &quot;The Buddy Holly Story.&quot;

Hmm...where to begin? The concepts behind this set come from a wide array of viewpoints. OK, so this was going to be a collection of some of the finest examples of `60s soul music; that decade in mind was and still is, to soul fans and historians alike, the heyday of that genre. The `60s was a time of radical revolution in both social and musical aspects. Socially, the civil rights movement as well as the youth of the country crying out to be heard in favor of peace and justice, and the simple yet individually complicated love lives and other emotions of everyone. Musically? That's where all the aforementioned could be expressed with such true-to-life depth. Soul music did all that; every emotion and feeling that the whole population, young and old, black and white, could be felt in this, one of the most dynamic impacts in all of popular music. These song choices, debatable for many collectors, seem to fit the bill.So what makes this collection so special? Well, giving the above mentioned plus taking to mind presenting a product that should really take the listener back in time to capture that era in every single essence; packaging included. If you heard a great tune on the radio, you knew you had to have the 45 at the least knowing you could do without an album. If you had some hot 45s and wanted to take them to a party, you needed a carrying case to take them in. Aha! That's the design of this box, handle and all. Unlatch the lid, and you'll discover what might have been in a typical record collection. At least one picture sleeve (Beg 1; full reproduction of Atlantic's only "Soul Clan" record from `68), a plain white sleeve (Beg 2), sleeves that displayed different record companies and the like (Scream 1, Shout 1 & 2), and perhaps a brown sleeve for good measure (Scream 2). Yes, there are seven-inch cardboard mock sleeves that are individually labeled at the top with all individual disc track information on the back, that contain the CDs. The CDs are cleverly disguised as 45 RPM records. The storage trays for the discs in the place of conventional jewel cases are plastic/cardboard 7-inch"records". On the back of each is the same artwork that appears on the CD which looks just like a record label from that period. So it's a record all around. "RHINO" replaces the name of the label names displayed. Beg 1 is Atlantic; Beg 2, Goldwax; Scream 1, Cadet; Scream 2, Tamla; Shout 1, Stax (Atlantic era); Shout 2, Motown.So as retrospective as it all is, the idea comes to mind of an all-night or all-day `60s soul music party. It's like a once-in-a-lifetime gathering of so many different stars. Sure, you'd want to hear as many different artists as possible, right? That's just what is provided. In fact, a fair balance of top stars and one-hit wonders are given and what's even more interesting is...no artist appears more than once. Exception: an artist may reappear in a group or duo if he/she was a solo before and vice versa. 144 tunes from a vast parade of more than 6 dozen labels are spread across 6 discs. Each contains a generous offering of at least 22 tunes and 60-73 minutes of music in incredible sound.Not all are in single mono mix, and at times the remastering reveals sound limitations inherent in the recordings. They're broken down into categories by what the title suggests: Beg 1 & 2 are mostly ballads with an occasional upbeat number that has a sense of a plea within; Scream 1 & 2 as well as Shout 1 & 2 are the party and feel-good songs; some, not all contain elements of screaming and shouting. As far as song choices go, given the criteria stated, top stars are not given their biggest hits nor is a "hit" being ignored altogether (a tune that doesn't get a whole lot of attention is presented), and one-hit wonders and obscure artists are given their only hits, obviously. Depending on the size of your collection prior to having this set, be in store for a mixture of emotions. Plenty of hard-to-find and obscure gems are in store, but on the other hand, do you really need a third or fourth copy of the Mar-Keys' "Last Night", Arthur Conley's "Sweet Soul Music" or Sam & Dave's "When Something Is Wrong With My Baby"? Don't let that turn you off though, because where else could you find together rare wonderful ballads like Toussaint McCall's "Nothing Takes the Place of You" (BTW: If you saw the first "Hairspray", it'll be hard not to think of that movie), Jay Wiggins' cheer-up message in "Sad Girl", O.V. Wright's idea of a "jury of love" called "Eight Men, Four Women", a very rare early effort from Aaron Neville called "Wrong Number (I Am Sorry, Goodbye)" (sigh with relief; it's not "Tell It Like It Is" for once), or perhaps the most heart-wrenching, get-down-on-your-knees-crying-uncontrollably-and-pound-the-floor-with-your-fists passionate plea from Lorraine Ellisoncalled "Stay With Me"? Alongside the ballads, where else can you get these instrumentals together like the Meters' ever-funky "Cissy Strut", Alvin Cash's bass-heavy "Twine Time", Booker T & the MG's timeless "Time is Tight", the Young-Holt Trio's cool and jazzy "Wack Wack", or Cliff Nobles' pulsating "The Horse" and great party songs like the Five Du-Tones' original "Shake a Tail Feather", the Esquires' "Get On Up", Shorty Long's tale of a colorful cast of characters at the "Function at the Junction", Shirley Ellis' "The Real Nitty Gritty", or another rare original kicking classic "Some Kind of Wonderful" by the Soul Brothers Six? How about acknowledging future `70s stars who had a noteworthy record in the `60s like Al Green (Back Up Train), the O'Jays (Lipstick Traces), the Intruders (Cowboys to Girls), or Eddie Holman's "Hey There Lonely Girl" that often falls in decade limbo (recorded and released in late '69 and still on the chart the following year)?Answer? You'd be very hard-pressed. No matter where you'd look, you'd see some of the same tunes pop up again, only showing what legendary status they have gained. However, no matter how many times you hear them, they never fail to grab hold of your senses; you just can't hear this kind of music in this quantity and quality on predictable oldies radio stations anymore...if that's what they're still called today in 2007, 10 years following this package's marketing debut. Rhino has considered in some cases to offer different takes or mixes of some songs you know or may already have. Solomon Burke's "Got To Get You Off My Mind" is longer and his vocal line is noticably different and the horns on Aretha's "Since You've Been Gone" are louder. Hey, if the Beatles, Bob Dylan, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix were so great, then so are these fine ladies and gents. Every major soul performer has been included, except for Sam Cooke and Sly & the Family Stone for reasons of licensing alone. More might have made it on here as well, but this is generous enough. It is very ideal for someone who is new to soul or who is into record collecting. Classic soul collections you see on TV churn out far more overplayed classic songs than this one, and they don't have such cool packaging as this. With so many different releases out there to choose from, why should this be any different?Something else that makes this so unique is that this might be the only collection that contains a photo of every single artist; others can't give more than 40, but 140 for this? Whew! The photos are in the form of baseball cards (another hobby of the day) which display track information and numbering in case you mix them up, that displays the artist and their represented song on the front with a trivia question at the bottom. On the backs are the peak chart positions and year for the song as well as mini-essays provided by the various project staff members. There are two exceptions with the photos: Jay Wiggins' photo is dubious as there are no photos of him on record, and whoever is in the photo is facing away. The Starlets, not the Blue-Belles, recorded "I Sold My Heart To The Junkman". Though this is correctly acknowledged, there is no photo of the Starlets available, and the photo is of the attributed group. A booklet is provided and the liner notes are very entertaining and informative with an inclusion of the complete track listing, songwriter and producer credits, as well as label name, catalog number and chart positions. 15 given "real-deal" labels don the back of the booklet as well as the inside of it.Having said all that, the worst news is that it is sadly out-of-print. Rhino has considered bringing it back, but there's no telling when that might be. They make amazing products and this is one of their most attractive. They went all-out on this one, but if it took so much effort to come up with amazingly creative packaging, how many would likely be pressed? So it's no wonder. If you're reading all of this...thank you if you are...and you checked out the sound clips, particularly the ones you may not know or haven't heard in ages and they sound pretty catchy, you're thinking of going for it anyway. My only advice is to get whatever might be reasonable for you. You not only get 6 hour-long discs of unbeatable music in any day and age along with some neat, colorful and authentic looking packaging (won a Best Packaging Grammy; surprised?) and an in-depth and entertaining history lesson. "Beg, Scream & Shout" is the most fun and diverse collection of its kind, but don't keep all this great stuff to yourself. It ain't nothin' but a party; that's what it's all about. CAUTION: This music is highly addictive...so turn it up loud!

&quot;A Garfield Christmas&quot; is a treasureable Christmas animated film that should be enjoyed by kids everywhere. Garfield has really lost a lot of his popularity. The current sales rank of this video shows why. It shouldn't be that way! I love Garfield and so should everyone else. He's a fat cat, but a cute one at that. This is something that is unlike any other Garfield program. It toches your heart at times. Merry Christmas!

&quot;Being There&quot; is a bittersweet, dark comedy about Chance the Gardener (Sellers) who is secluded all of his life in a D.C. townhouse, until it is condemned by suspicious attorneys, Chance experiences life in reality compared to what he thinks it was by watching the everyday programs on TV. &quot;I like to watch.&quot;, he often says. Chance, an illiterate as he is, is hilarious, yet as time goes by he touches the lives of everyone around him, including the politics with his witty stories about gardening. Excellent classic that is highly recommended.

That New Orleans and Mardi Gras feeling is all around when you slip this into your machine. New Orleans native Dr. John does a once-in-a-lifetime project paying tribute to his hometown and the colorful customs and lifestyles of the magical town. Every year when Mardi Gras comes around, New Orleans comes alive, and that's where a real celebration happens. That same spirit is as every bit as alive in this masterfully created album. Dr. John covers the entire New Orleans musical heritage in these 18 tracks that re-create that authentic sound so well. Listen to the horn and the rhythm sections and you'll feel it. He takes a nod to all the legends like Leadbelly ("Good Night Irene"), Fats Domino ("Blue Monday"), and Louis Jordan ("Do You Call That a Buddy"). He even takes you back to 1850 with the Gris-Gris chant of "Litanie des Saints." Legendary performers took part in this album like the Neville Brothers, Al Hirt, and Pete Fountain. That detracting factor is that a handful of these songs are a bit pessimistic in subject, but the music is very exquisite. A true landmark album from Dr. John, a very unique artist who paid a great respect and tribute to his hometown in these arrangements of such timeless classics. It makes it a perfect soundtrack for a Mardi Gras celebration, too.

The Marx Brothers, with no character names, play stowaways on board a cruise ship and turn business on board into a game full of tricks. They get involved with unscrupulous gangsters doing dirty deeds. Knock-out laughs in this one. Harpo has a great moment of physical comedy in one part where he becomes involved at a puppet show on board the ship where a hilarious mix-up occurs. Great chase scenes! Something you really need tosee if you really want to laugh.

&quot;Follow That Dream&quot;, believe it or not, was the first Elvis movie I saw. I first saw it about 10 years ago and own it. I watch it occasionally from time to time. This isn't a real top-notch Elvis film for me since because Elvis constantly looks tired and looks disinterested. It might have been the heat since it was done in the summer in Florida and temperatures went above 100. Elvis had to change his shirt constantly in one day. My mama loves this one. She's the one who started me off with my admiration of Elvis and everything about him. Now I'm a bigger Evis fan at the age of 15. This is something Elvis fans have to see at least once. You won't regret it. It gives you a down-home laid back country feeling as a rural Southern family settles on a &quot;public-settled&quot; beach, run a fishing equipment rental business, and try to keep gangsters from taking over.

I have recently seen &quot;The Lords of Flatbush&quot; on an older VHS copy which started out in widescreen until the opening credits were done. I wish I would have seen this widescreen DVD here. It probably looks spanking good. Stanley (Sylvester Stallone) is at a crossroads with his steady girl who feels they should get married. Bike-riding Chico is at odds with the new girl in town, Jane. Henry &quot;The Fonz&quot; Winkler makes his pre-&quot;Happy Days&quot; appearance in this film. He is the man! His voice sounds kind of funny at times. In one shot it looked like his dialogue wasn't matching his mouth movement. Was his voice dubbed? The soundtrack consists of songs written for the film that sound like typical '50s songs.If you like films of this genre like I do, go for it, dude!

If you're going to watch one Marx Brothers movie, pick this one. An exception to it would be "A Night At The Opera"! These two are excellent four-star cinema-classics! The popuularity of this film has grown compared to what it was in 1933 when it was first released. It was a commercial failure and one of the biggest flops for Paramount. Paramount would later drp the brothers for the bad business "Duck Soup" did. This film has Groucho giving many of his best one-liners, zingers, and puns. Chico, although giving no piano performances, has excellent scenes, too, with taht excellent mock Italian accent. There is a brilliant comedy sketch in which Chico and Harpo disguise themselves as Groucho in order to fool Margaret Dumont to get ahold the plans for war with a rival country. There is a neat mirror sequence where no one spekas for about five minutes. Magnificent, triumphant, and neatly shot war sequence which is the climax of the picture in which Groucho appears puzzingly in so many uniforms. Top 10 funny film of all time!

The Marx Brothers are the best comedy team ever. &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; is on of their very finest. Listening to Groucho singing &quot;I'm Against It&quot; is extremely funny. It's a shame this movie isn't longer. This kind of film will cheer you up if you had a bad day. If you ever do, watch this film. It's bound to make you chortle. However, in one part of the movie, when the brothers go over to Thelma Todd's house, the film in various points jumps ahead. For instance when Groucho and Zeppo are going to leave Todd's house (Groucho stays), Groucho kicks Zeppo, than the next frame Groucho runs to the window. Try to keep up with it if you can at that point. Than there are all of these film scratches and huge bars on the screen on every frame at one point. Universal did a pretty sloppy job at trying to remaster this movie. Other than that, this film will make you split your sides laughing.

I know this movie doesn't hold a candle to"Duck Soup" and "A Night At The Opera", but don't judge this film too harshly. Watch the movie, see what you think, you're entitled to your opinion. I think this movie is pretty good. Harpo has center stage instead of all of them, mainly Groucho, in the spotlight. Groucho only has a secondary role and appears in about 1/3 of the film. Harpo as himself is kept an eye on by Ilona Massey as she tries to get her greedy hands on a diamond necklace. This becomes unoticingly passed through a group of actors rehearsing a show. As Chico gets in on the action and Groucho steps in on the scene, the chase is on when the diamonds are hunted down...almost. Give this a try. You're going to laugh at a few parts, but again it isn't tops, but it's worth watching. Groucho's part is in 1/3 of the film as he delivers only one or two one-liners, but Chico and Harpo still display their musical talents. There is a hint of them sluggishingly getting through the film, but don't let it detract you from seeing the brothers' final film together.

This second installment of the Animusic video albums is freakin' cool. It is definitely different and innovatively more stylized than the first. What's interesting is that every object designed to play the instruments are all supported by levers and strings, in other words there are no floating sticks or mallets anymore.These are the eight different animations not in video order but how I rank them:1. Starship Groove (definitely kickin'; come on, how could you not like the sweet robots playing drums and little electronic pads on themselves on an open space freighter; love the design on the spaceship)2. Gyro Drums (it's the new "drum machine"; robotic arms and attached to rings fly all around on this scientific module lined with all types of drums and cymbals; love the part where the drummer in the center and the drums surrounding turn upside down and the electronic drums play; neat sound; very, very rhythmic)3. Cathedral Pictures (the only one not containing original music; just interestingly arranged by Wayne Lytle, the creator; I like the rotating drum set with two sets of arms playing it, the one string bass, the hammered string instrument (like in "Acoustic Curves", the big organ pipes, and the firework-like thing near the end) (It's "Pictures at an Exhibition": Promenade; Hut of Baba-Yaga; Great Gate at Kiev)4. Pogo Sticks (It's no "Stick Figures" but still cool. Mr. Bass Man, the stick, returns with two strings, and on wheels bouncing up and down, and brings in his distant cousins which are a higher sounding string instrument, two percussionists, and two mallet instruments)5. Fiber Bundles (Whoa, this is flashy. Give a listen to the different mixes in the special features section. You'll hear one group of instruments playing separately on three different mixes, plus a fourth one which contains all instruments playing. It's freakin' cool, there's all this buzzing and beeping, it's insane!)6. Pipe Dream 2 (You kind of know what to expect from the first. Except the music's slightly different. It has almost the exact same intro. The chimes on the ceiling have more on-screen time. It's interesting seeing an older animation with a new piece of music being programmed into it. The set also looks as if it has a used and dirtier look, plus the lighting is a bit different.)7. Resonant Chamber (Kind of like the "Aqua Harp", except this is indoors in the center of a room. It's one giant instrument with numerous parts to it. It's kind of bizarre-looking. The music changes from being mellow to having a groove to it. Each of the windows of the room have different phases of the moon for some reason.)8. Heavy Light (A bit too spacey sounding. It's still cool though. The structure is outdoors and looks like ancient ruins. Light projecting instruments pop up out of the structure and flash all these lasers everywhere. The music's definitely out there.)Nothing short of aamzing, proving yet again, that Animusic is a feast for the eyes and ears.

Looking for something that contains just about all of Franz Joseph Haydn's named symphonies? Look no further, you found it. Sadly, I don't own this box set (wish I did), but it's probably the best one that shows what Haydn's symphonies were about. What a talent this man had to write 104 symphonies, and have nearly 30 of them given nicknames (mostly of the nicknames were given by the general public at the time rather than the composer himself.) A perfect ensemble and conductor is picked: the Acaademy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields led by Sir Neville Marriner.Completely essential, except for one flaw. It's missing two named symphonies: No. 30 in C Major &quot;Alleluia&quot; and No. 64 in A Major &quot;Tempora Mutantur&quot;. That shouldn't dissuade you from purchasing this excellent set. I've never heard how they're played by this orchestra. I've heard other orchestras play these symphonies, but not by ASMIF and Sir Neville Marriner. Take my advice and get this set. You're getting your money's worth.

I've enjoyed "The Night They Saved Christmas" ever since I was 3. It still remains an essential Christmas film up to now, now that I'm 15. Jaclyn Smith is wonderful in this picture as the mother. Art Carney is Santa Claus, Paul Le Mat (American Graffiti) is the father, and June Lockhart (Lassie) is Mrs. Santa Claus). The North Pole City scenes are unbelievably beautiful and breathtaking. This was probably an expensive project. It has a very cozy setting. "The Night They Saved Christmas" is an essential family holiday movie to enjoy for years!

Ever wondered how much one of those 45s you have is worth? Here's the place to look. Not every artist is listed but with every new edition, more are added. I have a first edition which contains over 30,000 or so entries. The reason why I asked what I did above is beacuse if your collection contains older records or records that look just like the day they were first sold, you could probably have a collection worth thousands of dollars. Some songs are available on different labels, ones that are easy to find rather than ones that are rare on other labels. I saw that a near mint copy of &quot;For Your Precious Love&quot; by Jerry Butler and the Impressions on the Vee-Jay label is worth $10,000. A very good codition of that record is over $1,000. If someone has something rare like that or colored vinyl, they are lucky!! If this is your hobby whether you've started or it's been with you all your life, you shouldn't be without this book. RECOMMENDED!

Obviously, many other orchestras have recorded Beethoven's nine symphonies over the years and there are some digital recordings now of them. This is a c.1960 stereo recording released on CD in the '90s of Josef Krips and the London Symphony. The main complaint about this set, of course, is the weak sound. After listening to the entire set, the sound is a bit thinner than a digital recording would be, but it isn't bad. Of course, analog transfers to digital may not produce the strongest of results, but in this case, the sound is quite exceptional. The stereo is nice and even, and there is very little in the way of distortion. You can hear about every instrument (particularly the razor-sharp brass) so nothing is lost. The only bad thing about the sound is some slightly audible background noise and hum only heard during soft passages and does not in any way overpower the music nor should destroy your listening enjoyment. The ninth symphony (on disc 5) is the sharpest sounding, and sounds very clear. As far performance goes, Krips and the LSO perform with lots of energy and gusto and pour a lot of power into the pieces. The players, when handling solos do very invigorating jobs. The vocalists and chorus on the finale of the ninth symphony do rather impressively well; the soloist doing the introductory recitative as lots of vibrato in his voice. On the downside, some tempos in some sections are a little fast, but it isn't that noticeable and is not a big deal; every conductor as their own interpretation, and as I've mentioned earlier, numerous recordings were made of Beethoven's nine symphonies, so it shouldn't matter a great deal what you choosel; it's still the same great music.Now about the music: Nine of the greatest symphonic works in musical history. You can really hear how Beethoven came such a long way from his first to his ninth in a period of about twenty-five years as the era of revolutionary social change called romanticism was ushered in. Beethoven was the people's composer and did not work directly for royalty. He kept up with the changing times and expressed it in his music. His increasing deafness did not stop him from composing, and his true triumph over it and life-long quest for joy is the ninth symphony, more specifically the choral finale containing Schiller's immortal text of universal brotherhood. How could you not feel even the least bit touched after hearing it? The "Ode to Joy" theme is something that will live in your memory forever, as well as the first eight notes of the fifth.Overall, this is a good budget package. The other downside is that there are no liner notes, no CD case paper inserts, so all that's listed on the box are the total times for each symphony and which disc they appear on. So, yes, it could have been packaged with a lot more care. Other than that, it's a very good buy.

I love &quot;Garfield's Halloween Adventure&quot;. I read it around Halloween every year. I've read the book more than I saw the TV program. Garfield and Odie do the town going trick-or-treating and are thrilled with every moment getting candy left and right. Then, things aren't so thrilling as they wind up in a real-life very scary and frightening ghost story and experience pirate-ghosts up-close. Young and old readers who love comics will be thrilled about this! HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

This relaese, originally released in 1985 to commemorate 50 years after the birth of Elvis Presley, went double platinum a short while ago. Each song on this fantastic release is quite a gem. It gives a little variety of Elvis' musical talent. The rocker, &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, the romantic, &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, from the heart, &quot;If I Can Dream&quot;, the love songs &quot;Can't Help Falling In Love&quot;, the movies, &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;, and so much more! I was excited to get this years ago. Excellent song choices with very poor packaging. On a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best): Packaging = 2, Sound Quality = 4. It might be a little poor in those areas, but a must-have to start your Elvis collection.

Buddy Holly is another one of my favorite 50s singers.This here is a great basic album filled with Buddy's greatest songs. &quot;That'll Be The Day&quot;, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, &quot;Maybe Baby&quot;, &quot;Rave On&quot;, and more! It's a shame Buddy Holly didn't live longer to give us more great tunes. He'll always be remembered, and is a true Rock'n'Roll Hall of Famer.

"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World", in my opinion, is the funniest film ever created. I don't see why anyone would want to refuse watching this film. Over 30 years worth of comedians and top movies stars are in it including Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers, Dick Shawn, Terry-Thomas, Johnathan Winters, Edie Adams, Dorothy Provine, Peter Falk, Jimmy Durante and so many others. This is a quintessential motion picture comedy masterpiece about a police chief (Spencer Tracy) chasing after a group of crazed vacationers on a wacky and loony search for buried treasure of $350,000. This is something that you'd want to watch again and again. It's a very productive way to kill 3 hours. If you are a movie fan or you just love to laugh, this is it. "It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The TV specials &quot;Here Comes Garfield&quot;, &quot;Garfield On The Town&quot; and &quot;Garfield Gets A Life&quot; are finally on DVD. The TV specials were originally on short videotapes released in the early '90s and we rented just about all of them several times.Now after all these years, they have been discovered again due to the popularity of the new movie, these three original 24 minute TV specials will now be preserved forever because you can't find these anywhere else unless you own the old tapes and they're worn out. The picture quality is very sharp and rich in color. Garfield's TV specials as well as the aimated series was always a very colorful show. The sound, although in mono, sounds better than ever an is more crisp. The DVD quality far exceeds the VHS quality. Also available on this disc is a fantastic Spanish language track (great if kids want to learn another language), plus there are Englsih and Spanish subtitles. As a bonus, there is a short &quot;Inside Look&quot; on the new Garfield movie.Within the packaging of this DVD is the listing of the programs and the chapter stops, and a little booklet promoting Garfield's website, the three TV programs in their comic book editions fitted into a &quot;fat cat 3-pack&quot; comic book called &quot;Garfield As Himself&quot; with the same design as the DVD. I grew up watching Garfield and was practcially raised on Garfield. I'm glad to see he has regained enough popularity again to be preserved on DVD. &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; was on different stations, but on the station I used to see it on it had been taken off the air. Disappointing! However, with this 3-disc set of volume 1 of the animated series coming out soon, you can finally see them again.I can't wait! In the booklet for &quot;Garfield As Himself&quot; it says to look for more TV specials on DVD. How does this sound for the next disc: &quot;Garfield Goes Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Garfield In The Rough&quot; and &quot;Garfield In Paradise&quot;? I would love to see it soon. For now if you love Garfield, this is the first DVD available so act now!HERE COMES GARFIELD!

I've had this book with me ever since I was a child. The reason being is because I listened to a lot classical music as a kid. In this book there are dozens of composers listed from Bach to Webern and it tells you about their lives, shows some of their greatest compoistions, when they were written, published, written for, and how long they are and tells stories about each composition, too. This is what the bulk of the book is. It also includes musical theory, the proper behavior and apparel for a concert and some famous orchestras and conductors. This is something you must have if you're a big classical music fan. The only flaw this book has is not every composer is listed, for example Fernando Sor and the ones who didn't compose numerous pieces like Haydn, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and the countless others. Definitive!

This is a terrific compilation from probably the best Motown act ever! Yes, there are few errors here: songs like &quot;Beauty Is Only Skin Deep&quot;, &quot;I Could Never Love Another After Loving You&quot;, &quot;Loneliness Made Me Realize It's You That I Need&quot;, and &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot; are missing. I think I can understand why Motown did what they decided to do with this. The Temptations were a really special group, and their musical output was beyond vast, both with their hits and misses. A wide overview of this output was given and not just stuck to the same era. That's why songs like &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady&quot;, which is from the '80s, and &quot;Error Of Our Ways&quot;, from the '90s is on here.I don't why an a capella version of &quot;My Girl&quot; is here, though. If the four songs mentioned above were on this disc, it would be perfect running at nearly 80 minutes. Things were done to preserve continuity. All in all, you can't resist the temptation of purchasing &quot;The Temptations: Ultimate Collection.&quot;

Stu Hackel says in the liner notes, &quot;They stayed united for 43 years. No one in music ever did that. No one.&quot; Indeed, so true, and they're still together as an act today. It's now wonder with a great voice like Levi Stubbs leading them off, great songs from a great song-writing team, and the Motown magic provided by the Funk Brothers. &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; is an in-depth look at the Tops' years at Motown. Just about every record they released with Motown is on here with some very good B-sides like &quot;I Got A Feeling&quot;. It's got ME rockin' and a-reelin', I must say! Don't look for &quot;Keeper of the Castle&quot; or &quot;Ain't No Woman Like The One I've Got,&quot; for those were from their ABC/Dunhill years, since this is a MOTOWN collection. Personally, I feel that &quot;Something About You&quot; is one of their all-time best. You'll agree once you'll hear that infectious beat. The reason the sound quality might not fit your expectations is beacuse all the recordings were the original masters used on the 45 RPMs. There are many pros and cons about this. The pros would be that if anyone owned any of these 45 RPM records from back then can now hear exactly as they sounded. It sounds like remastered 45s! The cons would be that if one hears a song like &quot;Reach Out I'll Be There,&quot; or &quot;It's The Same Old Song&quot; on the radio it sounds different than the 45 and may not be what you're used to hearing. Reverb may be deleted and an instrument may not be as loud. These are such details you shouldn't worry about. Other great tunes are &quot;Ask The Lonely&quot;, &quot;Still Water&quot;, &quot;Shake Me, Wake Me&quot; and &quot;I'll Turn To Stone.&quot; They are all superior. If you're looking for a defenite worthwile compilation of the Four Tops, look no further; you hit the jackpot.

This CD is missing nothing. Every one of the Supremes' hits you can think of are here. Over 70 minutes of music and 25 songs fits the whole package perfect. The Supremes were one of the biggest-selling Motown groups. There might be a CD out there that features the Supremes hits without Diana Ross. However on here, are all the songs that feature Diana Ross on lead. The sound is amazing, the beat is infectious with that Motown sound produced with the background of the Funk Brothers. This IS &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;. I hear a symphony whenever I hear the Supremes.

Junior Walker, as was stated in the liner notes, never considered himself to be a star. Humility gets you places and with a wailing saxophone sound like this; mmm, man! To Motown fans, Junior Walker rarely gets the full spotlight. This completely flawless 25-track set shows you what this guy could do. Not only with that sax but the rest of the band delivering that hot, gritty, get-down sound! "Shake and Fingerpop", for oneexample, is a dance classic that deserves more attention. Opening with drums and a prolonged high-pitched vibrato note. The beat, the rhythm and the bass just makes you "get out on the floor and dance like you never could before." Another hot example, "(I'm A) Road Runner"; that's right up there with "Shotgun." This wasn't your typical, stylized Motown soul; this was soul to the nth degree. I hope it won't be too hot for those expecting typical Motown sounds. You've just found one of the most satisfying of the Motown Ultimate Collections.

It always seems that Diana Ross and the Supremes are always given so much credit to their contribution to the Motown sound.On some oldies stations, a lot of their stuff is just seemingly worn out. Hearing Martha and the Vandellas is like a breath of fresh air. I feel they would have been an even bigger success. This perfect 25-song set features their well-known hits like "Heat Wave" "Dancing in the Street", "Nowhere to Run", and"Jimmy Mack" plus well known B-sides like "Motoring" (fun song),"Darling I Hum Our Song" and "Third Finger, Left Hand." Motown was definetly not untouched by the Vietnam protests as heard in "I Should Be Proud" and "I Promise To Wait My Love." All the songs are good have lots of raw energy. The bass is strong on here like all the Motown Ultimate Collections. Yet another great Motown package. Martha Reeves was a live wire!

Certainly, a fitting compilation of the group's best songs! These aren't all in chronological order like some of the other &quot;Ultimate Collections&quot; are. That shouldn't detract from your enjoyment, though. That matters the least. I don't thank Motown missed anything when this was being put together. For someone young, I know Smokey and the Miracles well, and there are some songs I never heard of. Those were remarkable, too. It felt like the disc was never going to end. 25 songs is a perfect line-up. This is certainly one of the best Motown &quot;Ultimate Collections.&quot; Second my emotion, for it's worth your while!

Ever notice that you're seeing more and more of these "best of" collectons out there now? Now there is UMVD's "The Definitive Collection" of numerous artists from that same unforgettable era featuring 20 or more top tunes of the featured artist crammed onto one disc. Sometimes these single-disc collections fail to make the grade because of so much essential material that ends up being left off for reasons of space alone and the rest of it is the same predictable fare. An exception in this case would be this: Muddy Waters' Definitive Collection. This collection runs through Muddy's premiere years featuring his swampy, slide guitar sound and musical style then continues through the '50s and early '60s when he began to make his significant impact on blues music and eventually would be regarded as one of the most highly respected names in blues music. So many of his best tunes like "Hoochie Coochie Man", "I'm Ready", "Forty Days and Forty Nights" and "Got My Mojo Working" were covered by so many bands so many times that these tunes are really timeless and have becomes standards in blues. You really do get and stay interested for the entire length of the album. It is a little slow to start, but it picks up quickly and the bulk of the action happens with tracks 8-18. "Crosseyed Cat", recorded in 1976, is something you really got to hear. It is swampy, raw and tough. A 6 minute jam session, basically. This "Definitive Collection' lives up to its name overall, and is absolutely essential for the blues fan if the 2-disc anthology is a bit much.

Philadelphia has always been the City of Brotherly Love and it took two musical geniuses like Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff to compose the songs and arrangements that would reach out to all listening audiences letting them know that that phrase was more than just a phrase. In that classic O'Jays' hit of which this boxed set is named, all the nations of the world from England to Russia, China and Africa are connected as the "Love Train" comes "ridin' on through." The phrase "People all over the world" from the same song is later duplicated in MFSB's chart-topper "TSOP: The Sound of Phildelphia." MFSB, standing for Mother Father Sister Brother further emphasizing the Philadelphia spirit of unity, is the studio band that Gamble & Huff assembled to play behind the artists they wrote for and produced and was the sound they had bumpin'! All around they were one tight outfit. Going further with the subject of the need for positive social awareness, it could be heard in songs like the O'Jays' greasy and funky "For The Love of Money", Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes' "Wake Up Everybody", "Put Your Hands Together" from the O'Jays again, as well as McFadden & Whitehead's latter-era classic "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now." Yes, indeed: the Love Train was making its impact on American popular music and it was rollin' straight out of no other righteous American city than Philadelphia.This brand new edition of Gamble and Huff's Philly Soul contributions to R&B; music from 1967-1983 is a definitive portrait of their labors of love that started from their first chance meeting inside an elevator. From there to the recording studio and to the music charts, they cranked out one hit after another for various artists signed to their Philadelphia International label. The first half of disc one are the seeds that got the ball rolling with hits from Jerry Butler, the Delfonics, the Stylistics, Joe Simon, Wilson Pickett as well as Dusty Springfield. The second half of disc one and onward is where the Philly sound grew, developed and progressed encompassing the many phases that defined what '70s R&B; was all about through funk, smooth soul, quiet storm and ultimately disco. None of these songs are really pure disco although, Philly In'tl played the huge part in contributing to how disco evolved.All the hits are here and some have extended versions such as "I'll Always Love My Mama" and "I Wanna Know Your Name" from the Intruders, "Livin' For The Weekend" and "I Love Music" from the O'Jays, plus "I Miss You" and "The Love I Lost" from Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes. Those longer cuts are what made Philly In'tl what it was and, as stated before, because of their dancability and or seductiveness if it was a ballad, this lead to disco, the 12" single and to the only majorcomplaint about this set. Because of the lengths of many songs, it leaves little room for other artists to have significant spotlight time. For instance, artists like Lou Rawls, The Jacksons, Dee Dee Sharp, Bunny Sigler and Joe Simon could have had more hits provided as they had their fair share on the label as well. The O'Jays and Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes seem to dominate this set, and in a way they were synonomous with Philly In'tl, but the balance could have been a bit better. Then again, the purpose of box sets is to provide as thorough of an overview as possible without turning anything into combine mini-greatest hit collections. If you want to investigate further on an artist, you're welcome to, as their music is readily and separately available. If more songs were provided along with the 71 on here, this could have easily spawned a fifth disc. Two other minor quibbles is that this did not include the collaboration of artists as the Philadelphia International All-Stars' "Let's Clean Up The Ghetto" and the Ebony's "It's Forever" does not have the extended ending, but yet just about everything else does. Hear that one elsewhere in its 7 minute glory.Other non-Philly label artists include The Spinners (I'll Be Around, The Rubberband Man) and the Manhattans (There's No Me Without You, Kiss and Say Goodbye). Finally, Teddy Pendergrass, Deneice Williams, the Jones Girls, and Patti Labelle round out the set that carries the glossy and glittery quiet storm and dance sounds into the '80s as Philly In'tl leaves behind its glory days.The songs were as recognizable as their very own sound, and just as Motown and Stax had their own distinct sounds during their heydays, as did Philly In'tl. In fact if any two labels had their heydays during decades it would be Motown and Stax in the '60s and Philly In'tl and Hi for the '70s. With positive messages as well as the down-to-earth heartfelt emotions on life and love in the lyrics, Philadelphia International and their creators Gamble and Huff were the symbols and personifications of Brotherly Love and promotion for unity. Get ready to start and evening full of get-down dancin' and romancin' as you take a ride on the Love Train!

A lot of times these single disc collections try so hard to offer as much as possible the best of a certain artist. Too many times so much essential material is left off, and the same predictable fare is churned out, that it seemed effortless and pointless for the most part. That isn't necessarily the case with someone like John Lee Hooker, whose career spanned some 40-50 years on a variety of more than 20 some labels like Modern, Chess, Impulse, Vee-Jay, ABC-BluesWay and so many others. That's where it becomes very problematic and debatable as to what counts and what doesn't. Every label in every tiny aspect of his career couldn't be represented, of course, so balance becomes an issue, too. Another thing is that a handful of these approach or are over 5 minutes in length. It may sound like this is very picky, but for a single CD, this is a rather noteworthy representation. Early classics like "Boogie Chillen" and "I'm in the Mood" are represented as well as timeless upbeat tunes like "Boom Boom" and "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" which is blues at its very best. The latter part fo his career is represented with his collaborations with Canned Heat in 1970, and Carlos Santana and Bonnie Raitt in 1988. Other than those mentoned, "Dimples", "I'm Bad Like Jesse James", and "Think Twice Before You Go" are also definitely worth checking out as well as the three final tracks featuring the collaborations. "The Healer" is the most different of the three, and has a slicked, synthesized Latin-tinged groove. Overall, a fair enough representation is made proving how John Lee Hooker was successful with each generation he played for and encountered during his mammoth career, and is still appreciated with many new fans and bands today.

So says Chuck Berry in Little Queenie, &quot;Let's shake it! Let's get with it!&quot;. This is the best Chuck Berry album out there. 28 great songs on one CD. This is rock'n'roll at its best among the best! Chuck Berry knew how to play that guitar! Great carefree songs, very simple melodies, driven by the great bluesprogression mixed with a great driving beat! This how rock'n'roll was and should be! People who want to know what early-rock'n'roll sounded like should consider this a great pit stop. People my age think all that was back then was thanks to the Beatles. Uh-uh! Chuck Berry was among the many that inventedrock'n'roll and should be given more recognition. Teenagers should realize THIS is the good stuff! Forget the Beatles. Chuck Berry's got it and knows how to get with it!

Charlie Brown, with the help of Snoopy and Woodstock, prepare quite an unusual meal for his friends before him and his family leave for his grandmother's house. "Over the river and through the woods to Grandmother's house we go!". Charlie Brown is a real American cartoon icon. What the heck can you expect from the Peanuts gang? They're kids. Give it up for Charlie Brown even though he's missing the turkey, but who cares when you see it?

"Road to Singapore" is the first of the "Road" pictures starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. They are all wonderful, crazy, silly and just plain fun films as Bing and Bob wreak havoc along everything they encounter. In this first film, plenty of that is done, probably more likely in any other 'Road" picture as they head for Singapore and rescue the fair Mima from a bullwhipper. Some of my favorite sequences are the "patty-cake, patty-cake" scenes in which it becomes a running gag in every "Road" film, especially this. Filled with crazy antics, hilarious crack-ups, exotic dance numbers and s omuch more to enjoy even though the film is quite underrated and a bit quirky.
