Ghostface has delivered an album to remember with his latest release "The Pretty Toney Album" (2004). The first cut "Biscuits" is excellent , backed by some first class piano beats Ghostface and Trife rip this one up, delivering a blazing hot collabration that this reviewer will be bumping for a long time to come. Early tracks like "Hunta Fly Sh**" and "Beat The Clock" flow through well, then Ghost hooks up with Styles and Sheek on another standout the grimey "Metal Lungies". Ghostface reminisces about a special lady and love, backed by some oldschool soul sampling (You Got What I Need) on "Save Me Dear". Another outsanding track is "It's Over", Ghost talks about his hustling days backed by some very sick beats and a nice chorus. "Tush" feat. Missy Elliot is one of those harmless somewhat funny commercial cuts, that will hopefully earn Face some more well deserved sales. Ghostfaces gets introspective talking about himself on the relaxed soulful "Holla" and the fastpaced "Ghostface". Ghost's lyrics and flow are addictive on yet another standout "Be This Way". Upbeat "Tooken Back" feat. Jackie-O is a nice laidback track. Jadakiss and Ghost drop a banging cut with some memorable verses on "Run". The final track with Musiq is amazing, you can feel the "Love" that Ghostface shows for his loved ones and those that have passed and this track makes me really appreciate life and my loved ones. The production, lyrics, sampling found throughout this album are all excellent. Definetly feeling the "The Pretty Toney Album", recommend getting this one for the collection.

R Kelly's TP-2.Com (2000) is a memorable R &amp; B album. The moving single &quot;I Wish&quot; attracted me to getting this right off. Its an exceptional tribute song that some of us can relate to, the &quot;I Wish Remix&quot; is just as good for me, deep track that makes me remember a friend who died to young. R Kelly truly is a gifted singer, when he does songs like those two I appreciate his music even more. Early tracks that stand out me include the laid back loving song &quot;Greatest Sex&quot;, memorable &quot;I Don't Mean It&quot; - really like the chorus and lyrics to this track about trying to be a better man, apologizing and being there for ones future wife. &quot;Just Like That&quot; is another track not to be missed. Love ballads like &quot;Don't You Say No&quot; &amp; &quot;One Me&quot; follow through nicely. &quot;A Woman's Threat&quot; is powerful, the track about what happens when things go wrong. Upbeat &quot;All I Really Want&quot; flows through smoothly, and &quot;Feelin' on Yo Booty&quot; is a slow jam to enjoy. &quot;Storm is Over Now&quot; a positive feel good track closes off the album well. &quot;TP-2.Com&quot; is another impressive release from R Kelly, one that I would recommend for the collection.

Lauryn Hill's (AKA L Boogie) debut Grammy award winning album "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" (1998) is an excellent release which continues to vibe well many years later. My introduction to Lauryn Hill came on the Fugee's second album "The Score" (1996) another great album. As a lyricist L Boogie drops on point rhymes on "Lost Ones", then lights up the track singing. A passionate sounding Hill sings soulfully on the strong "Ex Factor". The smooth upbeat "To Zion" flows through nicely and leads up to the album's first single the outstanding "Doo Wop" (That Thing). Lauryn Hill then contemplates what an artist and music should be on "Superstar" while talking about making paper on "Final Hour". Sad sounding cuts follow in "When It Hurts So Bad" and "I Used to Love Him" feat. Mary J. Blige. Hill and D'Angelo deliver an impressive duet with the mellow "Nothing Even Matters". Lauryn Hill shines again on the exceptional "Everything is Everything". L Boogies rendition of "Can't Take My Eyes Off" is memorable, and Hill takes her audience to new heights on the closer "Tell Him". "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" is an album to have in any collection.

Jack Whyte's "The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis", sixth book, and 2nd in the series is excellent. Once again we follow Caius Meryln Brittanicus, in his quests, and watch an older Arthur becoming a leader, and in time the high king of all of Britain and wielder of Excaliber. In this novel we are brought back to Camulod, and now Meryln serves as a leader of colony alongside his brother Ambrose. Not to give away story, but tragedy will strike, and through this Meryln makes the change from leader of men, to Sorcerer- friend of few, feared by many, a powerful transformation. Evil always dwells, and this 2nd book in series has alot more action then previous. Once again the characters are descriped in great detail, and we get to know them through Merylns narrative. I in particular like the Pendragon descriptions, characters like Huw and Lyewelln are nice to follow. The only downside I can see at moment, is that there has not been a real follow up to this as yet, as the next book follows Arthurs father, hopefully in time Whyte will deliver more books for this series. Highly Recommend the "The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis", an entertaining and enjoyable read.

Rap Veteran Masta Ace has delivered an excellent release with his fifth album &quot;A Long Hot Summer&quot; (2004). This is actually my introduction to Masta Ace, who has been in the Rap game for over fifteen years. After listening to this one through and through I really feel I have been sleeping on a very underrated talented MC, and I know I am not the only one.After the first track which is more of an introduction, Masta Ace delivers the goods on the fastpaced &quot;Big City&quot;, talking about everyday people trying to make it anyway they can, Ace basically says don't just survive, thrive. 9th Wonder produced &quot;Good Ol Love&quot; is simply off the hook, backed by an ill beat, Masta Ace drops memorable rhymes while showing that he's still hungry. My favourite track is &quot;Da Grind&quot; feat. Apocalypse, love the beat, chorus and concept to this track, Ace talks about the ups and downs of the Rap game, what being an MC is really about at the same showing alot of love and relating with everyone who is working hard and trying to make it. Masta Ace tells it how it really is for many with the &quot;H.O.O.D.&quot; a track about the streets and poverty. Backed by an addictive beat Ace brings another outstanding cut with &quot;Beautiful&quot;, Ace inspires on this track promising to bring terror to the bling era and he does by delivering introspective positive first class music. An MC named Strick drops in for &quot;F.A.Y.&quot;, a track about being angry with those who want to see you fail. One of Rap's most skilled female MC's Jean Grae then collabs with Masta Ace on &quot;Soda & Soap&quot;, feeling the way Ace flows over this beat. Ace gives Mobb Deep associate Big Noyd a chance to shine on the thugged out &quot;Do It Man&quot;. On Brooklyn Masala Feat. Leschea, Ace appreciates a unique beautiful Pakistani woman. Punch & Words talk about all the women they hooked up with while traveling on &quot;Travelocity&quot;. &quot;The Ways&quot; is about the violent flipside of the Rap game. Edo G. pays a visit on &quot;Wutuwankno&quot; clearing up some misconceptions. Ace then does a multi collab with The Beatnuts and Rahzel on &quot;Oh My God&quot;. Masta Ace returns on solo with the introspective &quot;Revelations&quot;, which is really a track about being a madly slept on artist who's going to make it.Masta Ace has an ill flow, provides impressive lyrics and production is tight from start to finish. Originally an 80's MC, Ace shows his longevity providing music that new and old Rap fans can enjoy. In his own words this is his last album, making it all the more valuable. I have a feeling a lot of people with sleep on this one, which is unfortunate but those who get it will appreciate it. &quot;A Long Hot Summer&quot; in an exceptional album, which I highly recommend for the collection.

Jadakiss second solo album "Kiss of Death" (2004) is off the hook. It has been almost three years since "Kiss tha Game Goodbye" dropped, and Jada has clearly progressed since then. That said this ones clearly been crafted to sell, and Jada comes out less grimey then his mixtapes. "What you so mad at now" gets things started off, this one sounds like it could be a club banger. Next DJ Quik and Snoop Dogg drop in for the laidback "Shine", I like this collabration as its unique. The first real standout for me though is "Bring You Down", this track is excellent, backed by an addictive beat, and a premium chorus, Jada drops a very memorable track with ill lines like "You know the word anger is just one letter short of the word danger". Nate Dogg hooks up with Jada for the single "Times Up", Kiss rips up a nice beat with some more impressive lines. My favourite track this year is the next single "Why", Jada kicks alot of knowledge on this one, and will have his audience listening to his every line while Anthony Hamilton delivers a soulful chorus to rememeber. Rewind. Jada then speaks about the ladies on the relaxed "You Make Me Wanna", and grooves with Pharell on "Hot Sauce to Go". Then its Lox collabration time, first with Sheek on the fastpaced "Real Hip Hop", then with Styles on the banging "Shoot Outs". This second track is another one of my favourites, Jada and Styles kill this cut. Jadakiss excels on "Still Feel Me", an introspective track where Kiss talks about his life and making it in the rap game. "By Your Side" is another sick track, like the chorus and Jada's verses. Kayne West and Jada collab with "Gettin It In" another track about the ladies. Jada has a way of ripping tracks up no matter how mellow the beat is, "Air It Out" being a good example. "Welcome to D-Block" feat. Sheek, Styles and Eminem is a decent track, though that title name makes you think it would be pure D-Block track. Jada gets a bit more grimey on the title track then closes off the album on an upbeat note with "Im goin back". Beats, production, and lyrics are all on point throughout this release. "Kiss of Death" is easily my favourite album to come out this year, highly recommend this one for the collection.

Dru Hill's (Sisqo, Woody, Jazz, Nokio) sophomore album &quot;Enter the Dru&quot; (1998) is a good follow up to there first self titled debut. The &quot;5 Steps&quot; video was my introduction to Dru Hill and ever since then I have enjoyed this quartet's work. &quot;Enter the Dru&quot; consists of fifteen tracks(+ 3 Interludes) and is executive produced by Hiriam Hicks, Dru Hill, Kevin Peck, Kenneth Crear &amp; Haqq Islam. Guest appearances are limited to Chinky Brown Eyes and Method Man. First stand out track for me is &quot;How Deep is Your Love for Me&quot;, a fastpaced track, highlight of this one is a simple but nice chorus. Next three tracks are not that memorable for me, then we come up on the impressive &quot;You are Everything&quot; a track about appreciating ones loved one which has been remixed over the years. Soulful slowjams &quot;Ill be the One&quot; and &quot;One Good Reason&quot; succeed in being love ballads to remember. &quot;What Do I Do With The Love&quot; is a track about heartbreak (something many people can relate to). My favourite track is the Babyface/Damon produced lead single &quot;These are the Times&quot;, an uplifting positive love song. Album finishes off strong with the deep &quot;The Love We Had (Stays on My Mind)&quot; and even deeper &quot;What are We Gonna Do&quot;. Though some tracks standout more then others for me, there are no tracks that I dislike, making this an album with great continuity. On this release Dru Hill delivers smooth soulful music, backed by sick instrumentals making &quot;Enter the Dru&quot; an album for the collection.

Mos Def's latest album is "The New Danger" (2004). Sometimes I enjoy it when artist's experiment and get creative delivering music that is memorable. Other time's I feel like the artist has moved in a direction I am not interested in. This is one of those cases, I could give Mos props for all his past work and say this is a good album but I would not be expressing my true feelings. I am not feeling the rock based tracks, Mos's singing, rhyming, choice of beats and this album on a whole. To me its like Mos pushed himself to much trying to deliver many musical influences and remain orginal and ended up not shining in any of them. Part of my problem may be I came looking for Mos the MC, and found his presence limited and not nearly as impressive as his past work. My advice to people who are interested in this, listen to it with an open mind, if you have a broader sense of musical taste then this reviewer and are willing to give it more time then I did you may enjoy it, then again you may come to the same conclusion.

Common Sense's 2nd release "Resurrection" (1994) is without a doubt a classic Hip Hop album. Album starts with the track that shares it name, a relaxed laid back track with a jazzy beat that Common freestyles over. This is followed up by one of my all time favourite rap songs "I Used to Love H.E.R.", first time I heard this was loving the beat and flow to this track, but not yet understanding the true meaning of the song. Common tells the story of a womans plight which is actually a metaphor for the state of hiphop, and the downward direction it has taken since it became mainstream. Amazing song. "Book of Life" has Common getting introspective talking about himself talking about his ups and downs, love it. "In my Own World" (Check the Method) Common talks about being an MC another memorable track. "Nuthin' to Do" has a sick beat, and has Common talking about life in Chicago and giving shout outs to friends and fam, while Mista Sinista scratches. "Communism" has Common repeatly using "Com" you think that this repetive use of a word might get boring, in fact has opposite effect, and a mellow start/stop beat make it a nice track. "This is Me" is a feel good track, where Common talks about himself dropping lines like "No one can tell me how to be, because I am going to be me", upbeat positive track, lot of love in this track, Common ends track with showing love to his mums, and his music. What other rapper has tracks with names like "Orange Pineapple Juice", Common drops Pun after Pun on this one. Common collabs with Y-Not on "Chapter 13 (Rich Man Vs. Poor Man)" and tells a story about money. "Maintaining" has Common dropping nice verse after verse and "Some S*** I Wrote" is another nice track. Album closes off with Commons father on "Pop's rap" talking about his son, a original way to end an excellent album. All throughout the album Common blesses his listners with entertaining creative intelligent lyricism, backed by tight production from No I.D. and Y-Not. Common's "Resurrection" is reality rap at its best, definitely an album to have.

After years of struggle, Cuban Link drops his official solo debut "Chain Reaction" (2005). I have followed Link since his Terror Squad days, seen him lose his best friend, get blackballed and have his releases pushed back and back. Over the years Cuban Link has delivered a lot of memorable music, and 24-K was a great album, which never got distribution. I am more then happy to see this release. Cuban Link opens the album up sounding hungry on the intro "My Story". Link then proceeds to rip up the next two tracks with a strong flow on "Chain Reaction" and the deadly "No Mercy". Singer Avant makes the album's first guess appearance on the laidback "Comin' Home With Me" a track for/about the ladies. Cuban rhymes with a fast flow on "Riderz" feat. Cap-1. Don Omar drops in for a reggaetton collaboration on "Scandalous". I think "Sugar Daddy" will be a single; it has the makings of one as Mya and Cuban Link team up for a smooth winning collaboration. Couple of average tracks follow then Link drops "I Need To Know" , a very real cut about loyalty. Link brings the reggaetton flavor on "No Falla" feat. Zion. Cuban shows more hunger and ambition on the "Shakedown" then team's up with the Lox's lead man Jadakiss on the grimy "Talk About It". Cuban Link then shines on "Life Goes On", putting mad heart into this cut, while the talented Syleena Johnson provides a deep chorus. Cuban Link kicks some knowledge on "Prison Wisdom", which is followed up by the powerful dedication closer "Letter to Pun" an exceptional track. I would of liked to see a few less commercial tracks, but I understand why there here, this album was crafted to sell and hopefully it will. Cuban Link provides an impressive variety of music on "Chain Reaction", an album I highly recommend picking up.

After a three-year hiatus Roscoe returns with his second solo album "I Luv Cali" (2006). Roscoe's debut album "Young Roscoe Philaphornia" was one of my favorite releases of 2003, and the song "Smooth Sailin" off that album was a memorable summertime anthem. I am sure Roscoe is happy to be alive yet alone releasing another album as he was almost killed last year when a car he in was hit by a drunk driver. Roscoe was actually pronounced dead at the scene but miraculously woke up. The album's first full length track and a likely single is "Summertime Again", Roscoe provides a laidback cut celebrating his love for California and the summer on a feel good head nodder. The decent "That's Wassup" follows, and has Roscoe showing his appreciation for one night stands. Roscoe reps himself and his squad on "Get My Grind On", remembering how his older brother Kurupt always encouraged him to get his hustle on. No West Coast Rap album would be complete without a weed song Roscoe's is "Get High Like An Eagle". After the single the next real standout for me is "Rain and Shine", Roscoe goes deeper with his lyrics on this laidback love ballad. Roscoe grooves through "I Feel Like" and talks more to the ladies on "Flip Flop". Roscoe provides yet another sex based track with another single "F*** Buddy", the title to this track explains what its about. Roscoe needs to work on his thugged out cuts, he comes across half-hearted and lacking intensity on cuts like "Gangsta Gangsta Riderz" & "You Don't Know Me". Some girl's clearly got Roscoe twisted as he drops another love cut with "She's On My Mind". The album's closer is "Easy Come Easy Go", Roscoe gets more introspective on this cut talking about his life, property, paying respect to notable politicians and musicians and giving thanks to those who supported him. Standouts on this release for me are "Summertime Again" & "Rain and Shine". Roscoe's got a great remake joint called "Sometimes" on his myspace page which I would love to see drop. I feel like Roscoe provided less variety with this release, whether it is the lyrics, production (heard Roscoe's getting some Scott Scorch production on next album) or lack of notable guest appearances (EG Sleepy Brown) this joint's a step down from the last one. All the same "I Luv Cali" is a decent release, which I recommend checking out.

Outkasts(Andre Benjamin & Big Boi) third album "Aquemini" is a classic. Love the innovation, entertaining lyrics,and sick beats on this album. Executive produced by ONP, A. Reid, K. Edmonds and Outkast. Guest appearances come from: Raekwon, George Clinton,Cool Breeze,Lil Will, P.Brown,J.Gillian, D.Killings, Witchdoctor T-Mo, Big Gipp, Khujo, Cee-Lo (Goodie Mobb)and Erykah Badu. Album starts off with "Return of the G" a banging track where Outkast talks about what they represent, and what they have faced. "Rosa Parks" is the track that got alot of radio play off this album, funky track with a funny hook, with use of Haromica. "Skew it on the Bar-B" feat. Raekwon is a nice adrenaline laced track. The title track "Aquemini" is a sad track where Outkast goes deep while talking about their hometown. "Synthesizer" Feat. George Clinton is a funkified track, with a whole different feel to it. "Slump" is a sick track, where Outkast talks about the Cops,Drugs and representing the South. Big Boi comes out solo on "West Savannah" a track where he talks about growing up, and his roots, love it, and the hook on it. "Da Art of Storytellin" (Part 2) uses sick background beats, and Outkasts flow is deadly and banging on this one. "SpottieOttieDopaliscious" uses trumpets, mixed in with impressive R&B vocals from P. Brown, relaxed track, which like its name is dope. "Y'All Scared" feat. Goodie Mobb, is a dark track, about Drugs and Death. "Liberation" feat. Cee-Lo is a soulful track, Outkast comes out deep and memorable on this one. Album ends with "Chunkyfire" a strong closer, to a great album from Southern Raps best rap group. Like all there releases, "Aquemini" is definetly an album worth getting.

The Pharcyde's second album was "Labcabincalifornia" (1995). The Los Angeles group consisted of Derrick "Fatlip" Stewart Tre "Slimkid" Hardson, Imani Wilcox, and Romye "Booty Brown" Robinson. Pharcyde, Slum Village's Jay Dee, M. Walk and Diamond D produced this 17 track release. The albums opener Jay Dee produced "Bull****" is a dope track which was an immediate head nodder. My favorite track on this release is "Runnin", a smooth track, the Pharcyde drop some memorable lyrics and a chorus to remember. On "Something That Means Somethin" the Pharcyde drops some conscious lyrics, while ripping up "Drop" with fast paced rhymes. "Y?" has the Pharcyde talking about betrayals and the ups and downs of life. A short interlude follows, then Slim Kid shines on the premium M-Walk produced "Moment In Time", a track dedicated to those who died to young. The Pharcyde talk about their ambitions to make it on "Hustle". Backed by some heavier sounding beats, Pharcyde then deliver "Devil Music". The album closes off with the "The E.N.D.", a track, which has the Pharcyde giving thanks, Kamau delivers a memorable on point guest verse. The Pharcyde delivered original and memorable music with their last major release "Labcabincalifornia".

The Rascalz (Red 1, Misfit, Kemo, Zebroc, Dedos) dropped "Global Warning" there third album in 1999 (Previous Albums: Really Livin (1993) Juno Award winning (Cash Crop), later albums: Reloaded (2002). "Global Warning" was a momentual album as it helped put Vancouver on the hiphop map, and was widely popular in Canada and became well known internationally. I remember watching some of these guys play ball back in the day, and years later seeing them, at a local restraunt/bar, it is always good to see people from around your way make it. Guest appearances from artists like KRS-ONE, The Beatnuts, Choclair, K-OS, Barrington Levy, Kardinal Offishal and more, helped promote this album alot as well. Twenty tracks total some of the ones that standout for me are: "Top of the World" feat. reggae singer Barrington Levy, a melodic track which benefits from Levys sick vocals, "Fallen" Feat. Toronto mc K-OS, a song where the Rascalz reminisce, and K-OS drops addictive vocals, favourite track on this album. "Priceless" feat. Esthero has got a sad feel to it, and Rascalz kick some important knowledge: like theres more to living then money we have morals, love, hope, peace, so even though song has a sad feel to it, there are positive messages within. Beats throughout the album are fairly good, and theres variety in the music dropped, however there are some songs that just dont cut it, and others that are average. Noticeably some of the best tracks are the ones with guest appearances. Another thing I do appreciate about this album is the Rascalz willingness to diversify there music whether it has west indie flavour, Wu-Tang Sampling on "C-IV" or simply using concept of getting a WWF wrestler on the track "Sharpshooter". All though this wont go down as a great hiphop album, it did have an important effect on Canadian Music, and for that Canadian Hiphop Fans should be very grateful, hiphop in Vancity went from relatively unknown to mainstream thanks to pioneering groups like the Rascalz. 3.5

Nas's 8th album (including Lost Tapes) "God's Son" is a nice followup to Stillmatic and a worthy successor to any of his good albums. Two albums in one year, and both of them nice, very productve year for Nas. Actual album is 14 tracks, with bonus cd with 3 tracks. Executive produced by Nasir Jones and Steve Stoute. Track production comes from: Salaam Remi, Eminem, Ron Browz, The Alchemist, Claudio Cueni,Michael Herring, Alicia Keys, Chucky Thompson and Agile. Guest appearances include Bravehearts, Kelis, Claudette Ortiz, 2pac, J. Phoenix, Alicia Keys,Jully Black and Lake. Album opens with "Get Down", using samples from James Brown, really wicked start to the album, and just a starter. Next comes the Eminem produced track "The Cross" a track where Nas talks about his enemies. Next comes the albums first single "Made You Look" (Salaam Remi), a grimey memorable track with sick beats. This is followed by "Last Real N**** Alive" this is a deep track where Nas talks about the game, rivals like Jay-Z, loss of close friends. "Zone Out" feat. Bravehearts is a skippable track. "Hey Nas" feat. Kelis and Claudette Ortiz of City High more relaxed track where Nas talks about the ideal loyal woman. "I Can" is a positive track with piano background beats where Nas talks to the young, lets them know that with hard work and perserverance they can become anything they want. "Book of Rhymes" and "Thugz Mansion" Feat. 2pac, J. Phoenix folllow, the first is nice relaxed track, second is alternate version of track that appeared on the latest post-death 2pac release, is out of place on this album. Nas follows this up with hardcore banger "Mastermind" produced by Alchemist. Nas and Alicia Keys collabrate for "Warrior Song" another entertaining track. Nas teams up with QB rapper and much respected Lake on "Revolutionary Warfare" a nice short track. In the album cover theirs a picture of Nas's late Mom Ana Jones and "Dance" is a deep tribute to her and uses horns from his pops Olu Dara. Agile produced "Heaven" feat. Jully Black closes off the album strong. Bonus tracks are decent though it would have been nice if it could all be on one disc. Lyrical mastermind Nas's "God's Son" is definetly an album worth having with exception of a few filler tracks album is real nice. 4.5

Tupac Shakur's 4th album "Me against the World" released in 1995, is arguably the illest rap album ever. When Hiphops most loved, most controversial legendary MC dropped this album, he showcased to the world more than ever his intellectual and poetic ability. The media liked to portray him as a violent thug, but in truth it was never like that, first and foremost Tupac was a musician with a message for the world, who never held back from displaying emotion whether it be anger, love, sadness etc, even if it meant he was going to be hated for it. Every track on this album is nice, some of my favourites (among many) include "Me against the World", "So Many Tears" and "Dear Mama" one of the realest tracks Pac ever wrote. Pac seemed to know that death was in his cards, and he gives indication of this on some of the tracks, throughout this album. Music on this album covers many different topics and many different emotions, as one person wrote "If there's a facet of the human experience that's left uncovered on this release, I can't think of it". It wasnt just Pacs lyrics, beats, versatility or production that made him the best, it was that real raw emotion, he put into his works that made him Hiphops most loved. "Me against the World" is one of the best albums of the 90s, essential for anyone who loves good music.

Dead Prez (M-1 & Stic) third release "RBG: Revolutionary But Gansta" (2004) is a short but impressive fourteen track release (two hidden cuts). I first got into Dead Prez with there debut album "Lets Get Free". Bought this album two days ago, and have been bumping it on the regular since. Production comes from Dead Prez, Tahir, Sean Cane, the downbeat production collective, while guest appearances and vocals are limited to Krayzie Bone, Blue, Aisha Mic and Jay-Z. The case insert contains Dead Prez "RBG Code" which is: No Snitching, Protect Self, Family and Community at all Times, Each One Teach One, Be Organized and Be Productive. The album opens with "Don't Forget Where you Came From" where Dead Prez talks about living right, and follow it up with the eerily powerful "Walk Like a Warrior" feat. Krayzie Bone. The next track "I have a Dream, Too" has Dead Prez, talking about police murder and corruption, and giving shout outs to there people. Next Dead Prez lay down what being "D.O.W.N." means, and follow it up with the outstanding "Hell Yeah" (Pimp The System), this cut is laced with a deadly chorus. Another excellent track is "W-4" , easily the most chilled out sounding track on the album, this one features the smooth background vocals of Aisha Mic, and has Dead Prez rhyming some deep lyrics about being poor and trying to make it, while singing a memorable chorus. Next Dead Prez recommends turning off the bull**** with "Radio Freq", while "F**ked up" is about alcholism. Another standout is "50 in the Clip" a banging track, find myself motivated to do pushups when I listen to this one. The lyrics to "Way of Life" are sick, a track about dedication, training, hunger, and the seperation between fake and real. "Don't Forget Where u Goin'" takes thing back to the beginning. "Hell Yeah" (Remix) feat. Jay-Z closes off the album strong, or so I thought at first, except there are two more solid hidden cuts found on the this release, one of these being an extended guitar backed version of "Hell Yeah". What I like about Dead Prez is they create unique music, have some core beliefs and are not afraid to drop there views (which are controversial and could be found offensive to some). While this release is short, I find the quality of the music makes up for it, and I recommend "RBG: Revolutionary But Gansta" for the collection.

It's hard to believe that its been more then ten years now since Tupac Shakur died. I have been a fan of his music since "2Pacalypse Now", whether it be classic Pac material, post-death material, remixes or rare unreleased music - I have always wanted to hear it. Watching movies like "Resurrection" gave me some more insight into what the man was really like and where he came from. Pac's music has touched million's of people worldwide, and will continue you do so for a long time to come.Tupac Amaru Shakur - (June 16th 1971 - September 13th 1996) R.I.P."Pac's Life" (2006) is the sixth post-death studio album and has numerous guest appearances from Krayzie Bone, Ashanti, T.I., Hussein Fatal, Papoose, Carl Thomas, Keyshia Cole, A3, Jay Rock, Young Buck, Chamillionaire, Nipsy Hussle, Young Dre, Lil Scrappy, Nutso, Yaki Kadafi (R.I.P.), Stormy, Ludacris, Keon Bryce, Big Syke, E.D.I., Young Noble, Snoop Dogg, Chris Starr, Gravy. Having heard some of the original unreleased material, which was used for this album, I can agree with the reviewer who would of liked to have seen it be released as is. A good example of that would be the unreleased original cut "Play Your Cards Right" which has Pac and KC & Jojo delivering a very memorable track. Another misstep is having the "Dear Mama" (Bonus Remix) appear on only the UK version of this release. Anthony Hamiliton appears on this exceptional remix, of one of the all time great 2pac cuts. "Soon As I Get Home" is the most authentic, unaltered Pac track on the new album. The addition of singer Keon Bryce and Ludacris on the male version of "Play Your Cards Right" works well, Ashanti and T.I.'s inclusion on "Pac's Life" is not bad either. I find some of the production, beats and guest appearances on other tracks to be lackluster or not fitting. I don't feel like "Pac's Life" measures up to do some of the other post-death album's, all the same I can understand the material being more and more limited.

The post death release of Notorious B.I.G.'s(Christopher Wallace) 3rd album "Born Again" (1999) may be disappointing to some, not this reviewer though. When this album came out I was just happy to hear ANY new Biggie material, I consider him one of the best Rap MC's ever to come out and I love his music,the classic "Ready to Die" is like an addictive drug, an album I always have and "Life After Death" is ill as well. Executive produced by Sean Combs, Voletta Wallace & Faith Evans, guest appearances are numerous (with reason- a very limited amount of Biggie material) and come from: Lil Kim, Puff Daddy, Eminem, Hot Boys, Big Tymer, Mark Curry, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Junior M.A.F.I.A., Redman, Method Man, Too Short,Sadat X,G. Dep, Craig Mack, Missy Elliot, Mobb Deep, Joe Hooker, Black Rob, Ice Cube, Beanie Sigel, KCi & Jojo, Nas and Lil Cease who appears solo and with his group. Note- Album Insert/tracklisting when turned around is a nice poster. This album would be better off named Notorious B.I.G. Collabrations or something like that as that essentially is what it is, Biggie only being on two tracks solo altoghether. "Born Again" opens with Biggie talking about where he would like to be in ten years, and is followed up by "Notorious B.I.G." feat. Lil Kim & Puffy, basically upbeat tribute of a track. Eminem's guest appearance on the wicked "Dead Wrong" is okay though not needed. Next two tracks are bunk then we come to "Biggie" feat. Junior M.A.F.I.A., and though Biggie is limited to a few lines on the track, it is a genuinely nice banging tribute from his peoples. "N****s" has the Notorious on solo and is off the hook, nice lyrics from Biggie combined with a sick beat make it a memorable track. "Would You Die for Me" feat. Lil Kim & Puffy and "Come On" feat. Sadat are decent. DJ Premier produced "Rap Phenomenon" feat. Redman and Method Man uses a nice repetitive beat. "Tonight" feat. Mobb Deep & Joe Hooker which is reworked version of "Long Kiss Goodnight" is banging,the combination of one my fav MC's with one of my fav groups make a highly enjoyable track. Deric Angelettie produced "If I should Die before I wake" feat. Black Rob, Ice Cube & Beanie Sigel is blazing hot, sick beat, and all the guest appearances are really good. Next comes the other Biggie solo track "Who Shot Ya" which is excellent. "Can I get Witcha" feat. Lil' Cease is a laid back track where the Notorious talks to the ladies and drops some funny lines. This is followed up by "I Really Want to Show You" feat. Nas and KC & Jojo a track which contains Biggie lines from "Everyday Struggle", the brother duo come thorough with some smooth soulful vocals, and Nas storytells. The album ends with "Ms. Wallace", Biggies mom talking about her son- Christopher Wallace and what he was like growing up and the man he became. This does not compare in any way to Notorious B.I.G.'s previous two, and it should not be compared as those two albums had far more Biggie material to them. "Born Again" is somewhat of a tribute collabration album which unfortantely got promoted as a full biggie album. On reflection I agree with other reviewers in that this could of been made into a better album. If your new to him, definitely check out his other albums first, but if your like me and love Big Poppa you may want to add "Born Again" to your collection. 3.5

Until recently I have enjoyed Coldplay's music from a distance, listening to the radio tracks, watching the videos. I generally listen to different music genres, but Coldplay's music shines through and is deserving of the vast musical audience it has gained. I bought "A Rush of Blood to the Head" (2002) a few weeks ago and have been enjoying it ever since. With almost 800 reviews written on the album, theres not much if anything to expand on. The singles "In My Place", "The Scientist"and "Clocks" are excellent. I like the fastpaced "Daylight" and "Warning Sign" goes deep. The opening and ending tracks, "Politik" and "Amsterdam" are two more of my favourites. This is one of those albums, I can listen to and enjoy through and through at any time of the day. The variety of sounds Coldplay provide are addictive, and Chris Martin's soulful vocals are impressive. Albums like this make me appreciate other music genres, definitely one for the collection.

First heard Telepopmusiks &quot;Breathe&quot; on local radio station, missed the name of the song, but then while watching televisionI heard the song again in the Mitsubishi commercial and got the name. Love the relaxed chilled back sound of &quot;Breathe&quot; the smooth background beats, and simple repetitive vocals create an enjoyable listening experience, track vibes positively. A nice background track for a commerical, however I wont be going out and buying a Mitsubishi any time soon!

Nas (Nasir Jones) 3rd LP "I Am..." (1999) came out after a three year break by Nas following his first two albums, I was really happy when this came out as I had been waiting for a Nas album for a long time, and in 99 I had this album on regular rotation. Nas uses reliable production getting tracks from L.E.S., Trackmasters, Timbland and two tracks from DJ Premier- in my opinion the best producer out. Guest appearances from from DMX, Aaliyah, Puff Daddy and Scarface. DJ Premier produced "New York State of Mind, Pt. 2" starts the album strong, a great track like the original. The powerful "Hate Me Now" feat. Puff Daddy follows, the booming beat and Nas lyrics on this are excellent. Even Puffy the shiny suit man (I think of Diddy as more of a CEO then a rapper) provides a solid background chorus. Scarface drops in for the collabration track "Favor for a Favor", I like NY/Texas connection. Nas pays his respects to the late greats: 2pac and Notorious B.I.G. on "We Will Survive" and though he may not have had greatest relationship with them I think this is a genuine tribute. Nas talks about politics, religion, death, jail and poverty on "Ghetto Prisoners". "You Won't See Me Tonight" feat. Aalyiah (R.I.P.) is a good rap/r&b collab. Right around the time this album came out, the movie Belly which stars Nas and DMX came out so it makes sense that X drops in for "Life is what You Make It". "Nas Is Like" is another standout track, Premo provides a dope beat and Nas drops some memorable lines. Sad sounding R. Kelly background vocals are used on the decent laid back "K-I-S-S-I-N-G", where Nas talks to a special lady. Album finishes with "Undying Love" a narrative about finding out ones love is cheating, and the tragedy that follows. I enjoyed "I Am..." and recommend it as an album for the collection.

Jelleestone first album "Thirteen" (2001) is a nice first release from a talented up & coming Canadian rapper. Party track "I Dont Care" starts off the album with a repetitive beat. Next comes the album leads single the upbeat "Money (Part 1)" the track most people would associate with him if they know him at all. To be honest Jelleestone comes across more as a singer then a rapper on this track, but I like it, he has a good voice and the simple concept of trying to live the good life is one many can relate to. "Once was Young" has Jellee talking about growing up, and is followed up by my favourite track on this album the dark "U R The New Messiah" a track where Jelleestone talks about the streets and hustling, while dropping his own deep chorus inbetween lines. Laid back "How You Do It" deals with the strains in relationships, and the abuse that can happen within them. Main message behind this track is treat your loved ones right or you may lose them. Powerful "We Da N****s" follows, and Jellee reps himself, Rexdale (Toronto) and his crew well. Jelleestone experiments on "High" spitting fast, backed by a simple R&B chorus, not big into this track. "Rex Ent Inc" is about repping his hometown and Rexdale the area he grew up in, and is followed up by the fastpaced "Inner City Pressure" which is all about the game. The albums closer is the long "Root of All Evil" a track where Jstone uses a variety of vocal tones. What I like about Jelleestone is he shows his talent as an artist by rhyming, singing and doing alot of his own chorus's while keeping his music for most part introspective,creative and entertaining. There are a few tracks I am not big into, like "TFL" and "Black Sex", however there are a number I like- it would of also been nicer if this album was a bit longer. I am looking forward to checking out his next album to see how he has developed as an artist. Relatively unknown "Thirteen" is a decent first release worth checking out. 3.5.

The Roots have returned with there sixth effort &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; (2004) a short and enjoyable release. It usually takes me time to absorb the Roots music this album being no different. The opener &quot;Star/Pointro&quot; get the album off to a strong start, a feel good track which grows on you. &quot;I Don't Care&quot; feat. Dom vibes smoothly and would definetly be a better first commercial single then the current pick in my opinion. &quot;Guns are Drawn&quot; is a memorable oldschool sounding track, favourite part of this one is Aaron's chorus. The Roots drop a track to groove to with the lighthearted &quot;Stay Cool&quot;. Another standout track for me is the original &quot;Boom&quot;, Black Thought kills it while delivering Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane like flows and rhymes. Devin the Dude and Jean Grae contribute nicely on &quot;Somebody's Gotta Do It&quot;, while Black Thought tears into the lack of innovation in todays Hip Hop scene. The closer &quot;Why&quot; (What's Goin On?) flows through really well and is my favourite track at the moment. Some might wonder why I am giving this one four stars instead of five, for me it comes down to them not surpassing some of there past albums in originality, depth and production, all the same this one is not be missed for Roots fans. Widely acclaimed as today's best live Rap act the Roots continue to impress delivering quality music with &quot;The Tipping Point&quot; an album I recommend checking out.

Guerilla Black's debut album is "Guerilla City" (2004). I remember a few years ago when Shyne dropped people were comparing his sound to the late great Notorious B.I.G., Guerilla Black is clearly the closest likeness though, in sound, rhymes and looks. Guerilla Black chooses to briefly mention this matter on the opening track "Hearts Of Fire" while talking about how he made it into the game. The next track is my favourite, titled "Guerilla City", GB reps Compton while singing the chorus. Next he hooks up with Beenie Man on his first single "Compton", its on this track that you can really see Guerilla is trying to sound like the Notorious in the way he rhymes and it sort of works, Beenie Man adds some Jamaican flavor. The next track which will probably be the 2nd single is the laidback "You're the One" feat. R & B singer Mario Winans. Guerilla Black raises the tempo to fast paced "Trixx" and "Guerilla Nasty" feat. Jazzy Pha and Brooke Valentine, not feeling either of these. Guerilla Black talks more to the ladies on "Sunrise" then hooks up with Nate Dogg on the decent "What We Gonna Do". GB dedicates "Say What" to Eazy-E, repping his hood backed by a repetitive chorus. Next couple tracks are really more of the same to me, none standing out, then Guerilla Black closes off the album with "My First" a deep track dedicated in memory of his young wife who died of meningitis. I mentioned earlier that Guerilla Black sounds and looks like Biggie Smalls, but don't confuse that as me saying he is near in skill to the late great Notorious. Some might say comparing the two is unfair, but when Guerilla Black try's to sound like Biggie using similar rhyme schemes, I think its fair to judge, he has a similar flow but lacks the wordplay, charisma and lyrical content of the Notorious. Having a Biggie like sound has helped Guerilla Black get some attention, but I think he is best off when crafting his own style and not trying to sound like the Notorious as a lot of people feel that is biting. End of the day though he is just another rapper trying to eat, in his own words he is trying to stay humble. Guerilla Black does stand out at times on this release, making "Guerilla City" an album worth checking out.

Thug Life (Tupac, Big Syke, Macadoshis, Rated R, Mopreme) released there only album Thug Life Volume One in 1994. Tupac who had two solo albums under his belt at this point led the group, and would appear on nine of the ten tracks. Big Syke taught Pac about the streets and Pac taught Syke how to rap. Morpeme aka Komani (Maurice Harding) is Pacs half brother and made his musical debut on Tony! Toni! Ton&eacute;!'s &quot;Feels Good&quot;. Guest appearances include Y.N.V. and Nate Dogg. Album starts off with &quot;Bury Me A G&quot; and has background vocals from the Isley Brothers, an ill track and crazy beats that continue all through the album. &quot;Dont get it Twisted&quot; is the only track without pacs presence, and its a good one, Morpeme,Rated R and Macadoshis lay nice verses to sick background beats. &quot;Pour Out a Little Liquour&quot; is the albums first single, and is my favourite track on the album. Another nice track in &quot;Stay True&quot; followsand Tupac and Mopreme stand out the most on this one. &quot;How Long will they mourn me&quot; was made for Big Sykes lost friend &quot;Kato&quot; and Big Syke drops deep and memorable lyrics, Nate Dogs vocals work perfectly with this track. &quot;Cradle to the Crave&quot; and &quot;Str8 Ballin'&quot; are powerfull tracks and close the album well. Its too bad that Thug Life never got a chance to make more music toghther, because &quot;Thug Life Volume 1&quot; is an amazing album, and things would only be bound to get better. Anyone with misconception that its solely a Pac album, only needs to pop it in, and listen to four other artists dropping ill music. Album was meant to be longer but Interscope cut out alot of the tracks saying they were too &quot;hardcore&quot; and did not think they would be marketable. The ten tracks that make up this album however make it a classic not to missed.

Tupac Shakur's first album "2Pacalypse Now" (1991) marked the public debut of an artist whos name will now forever be associated with Rap. Prior to this release he was a member of a group called "Digital Underground". Back in 91 he was young man wanting to share his views, and all throughout this album he does: whether addressing police brutality, discrimination, poverty, street life and politics. Tupac always delivers alot of emotion in his music, whether it be deep anger,sadness,calmness or happiness . "2Pacalypse Now" has thirteen tracks (55 Minutes long) and is Executive Produced by Atron Gregory and came out on Interscope. Guest appearances come from Shock-G, Strech, and Raw Fusion. No tracks of blatant self promotion, lots of conscientious thought provoking music. Warning for those who know the Tupac of later albums on this one: Tupac's flow is far less developed, and the albums beats are oldschool. His lyrics and ability to convey emotion are solid though. "Young Black Male" starts the album off, a track with 2Pac flowing fast and with several other people talking in background and laughing, you can not help but find this track amateur sounding, all the same I like it. "Trapped" is about being young and black and having to face discrimination, police brutality among other matters, Pacs lyrics on this one had me listening to every word, and I liked the simple chorus of "Naw they cant keep the black man down". "Soulja's Story" is a dark track where Pac talks about you have to be hard to survive. "Violent" has Pac talking about the police and uses a brief sample from Public Enemy's Chuck D. "Words of Wisdom" is a highly political track, which has Pac talking about everything from drugs, the government, the United States and dropping lines like "No Malcolm X in my history text, Why is that? Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek" lines that you can understand coming from the son of black panther. On later albums you will find less and less tracks like this. "If My Homies Calls" is one of the first real upbeat songs on this album and is a track about being there for ones boys, like the background beat used on this. The track that stands out the most on this album for me is the incredibly deep "Brenda's Got a Baby" , which has Tupac telling a story about the downward spiral a twelve year girl takes after becoming pregnant. "Rebel of the Underground" has Pac talking about himself and is followed up by the albums closer "Part Time Mutha" where Pac puts himself in the place of a part time mother and a track which also features a lady telling a story of abuse, a strong closer to a powerful album. I dont recommend this album to people who are looking for hot beats or the Tupac of later albums, or to people who hold very specific politcal views. I recommend this album to dedicated fans, and to people who are intrested in hearing a young more political Tupac. "2Pacalypse Now" introduced the world to a young emerging artist who would become one of hiphops most prolific and loved rappers, glad to have this album in my collection.

50 Cent's 2nd album "Get Rich or Die Trying" is worthy of all the hype surronding it. Finally 50 has got the backing (Aftermath/Shady), and the beats needed to make an excellent album. 50 has come a long way since "How to Rob", remember first hearing him on "In Too Deep Soundtrack" and I knew then he would blow one day. Underground for a long time, nice to see him drop an album commerically, and see that he hasnt sold out on anything. Executive Produced by Dr.Dre and Eminem, with guest appearances coming from Em, G-Unit members- Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lyoyd Banks, and the king of sick R&B hooks Nate Dogg. Ninteen tracks total including intro and 3 bonus tracks. Standout tracks for me at the moment are: "Patiently Waiting" Feat. Eminem, "Many Men", lead single "In Da Club", "High All the Time", "If I can't" and the relaxed banging "21 Questions" feat. Nate Dogg" and the adrenaline laced "Gotta Make it to Heaven". The 3 bonus tracks "Wanksta" (8 Mile soundtrack), "U Not Like Me" and "Life's on the Line" close off the album well. Full of tight Production, entertaining lyrics and blazing beats "Get Rich or Die Trying" is one of those albums people are going be bumping for years to come.

Tupac Shakurs second album "Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z." (1993) contrasts with his first in which he was more poetic, in this album he applies more of a gangster rap feel to it. Pac confronts alot of people including Dan Qualye former vice president of U.S. who was trying to get pac's music censored at the time. "Holler if you hear Me" the lead single starts off the album strong, then interlude has Pac rejecting authority, stating hes going to do whatever he likes, a concept he carried all througout his career. "Last Wordz" Feat. Ice Cube and Ice-T, had three of hiphops biggest names, collabrating, its a good track, and Pac lays the nicest verses. "Souljahs Revenge" continues the hardcore pace set. "Strugglin" feat. Live Squad is one track never felt. The most upbeat track which almost seems out of place on an album that had been full hardcore to this point is "Keep Ya Head Up" this is a preview of what Pac would would be dropping on later albums, as he developed as an artist. Tupac comes across really strong and positive on this strong while talking about difficult real life problems. Would call it a Classic pac track and it would later start off his greatest hits album. "I get Around" feat. Digital Underground is one of pacs earlier tracks where he talks to the ladies, its kind of silly, but its upbeat, and relaxed. "Papa'z Song" is about growing up without a father, which was Pacs situation and many peoples situations. Very powerfull track, which is not hard to relate to when you grew up like that. "5 Deadly Venomz" feat. Apache, Treach and Live Squad closes off the album. This was one of the early albums I got, and though its not a classic like his later works, it is a really good album, and back in 93 it was one of the best. Still like to pop it today almost ten years later, and listen to a younger Pac, because even then he was starting to display the potential which made him a legend.

Warren G's "Regulate..G Funk Era" is a classic and the best of all his releases. Its in no way a one track wonder as some people have stated. Album is full of positive vibes, and every collabaration and appearance is memorable and ill. Album starts off with the now classic song "Regulate" feat. Nate Dog, toghther they create an amazing track, the beat is crazy, and Nate and Warren create what is in my opinion the best collabration track ever. "Do you See" has Warren G talking about life, and transition. "Regonize" and "So Many ways" lead you to "This D.J". This track is my favourite of Warren G solo, the beat is crazy, and Warren G drops ill verse after verse with chorus: Its kind of easy when you listen to the gd up sound pioneers speakers bumping as I smoke on a pound..The next track "This is the Shack" featuring Dove Shack, and has a nice R & B blend. "And you Dont step" and "Running Wit no breaks" complete this album, both are nice smooth and soulful tracks. Newer Cds, now contain a bonus track a remix of regulate which is good, and the video. A very nice album, should be in every hiphop collection, also Warren G at his best.

The first Above the Law (Hutch, Cold 187um, KMG and Total K-Oss) release I came across was the groups fifth album "Legends" (1998). Los Angeles' Above the Law are one of those slept on groups that never got the attention that other groups of their time did. One track, which I consider a classic cut on this one, is the memorable "Deep AZ The Root"; love the lyrics, beat and especially the chorus to this one. On the dark "Set Trippin", Above The Law kick some killer rhymes over an ominous sounding beat, and come on point again on the powerful "Promise Me". Rhyming over an upbeat sounding instrumental ABL shine again on the smooth "The Streets". The laidback "Summer Days" is a distinctively West Coast sounding cut which flows through well. Above the Law take their listeners to another place on the slow introspective "Soul Searching". ABL closes off the album strong with "In God We Trust", a track that gradually builds up. "Legends" is a solid album worth having in the collection. 3.5.

A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg) debut album "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990) is an outstanding release. Q-Tip and Phife deliver intelligent rhymes, while Ali Shaheed Muhammad provides impressive production. The albums opener is the seven-minute "Push It Along" a track where the Tribe MC's deliver memorable and insightful rhymes backed a solid production (feeling the Jazz Guitar). "Luck of Lucien" flows through well, then Tribe shines again on "After Hours", love the scratching and lyrics to this cut. The smooth "Footprints" and dope "I Left My Wallet In El Segundo" follow. The laidback "Bonita Applebum" is a beautiful track, which has the Tribe talking to the ladies. "Can I Kick It" is a distinctive Hip Hop anthem in itself and Tribe keeps it moving on "Rhythm (Devoted To The Art Of Moving Butts)". The tracks that follow are all unique in their own way. When people talk about Tribe they often mention their classics "The Low End Theory" and "Midnight Marauders", they sometimes forget about the dope album that preceeded those two releases, "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" is an album to have in the collection.

A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg) "The Low End Theory" (1991) is a Hip Hop album to have, a very nice blend of Hip Hop, Jazz & Funk. Written, produced (+Skeff Anselm) and arranged by the tribe with appearances from Ron Carter (Jazz Bazz), Ms. Vinia (Vocals), Diamond D, Lord Jamma,Sadat X, Charlie Brown, Dinco D and Busta Rhymes. From "Excursions" to "Scenario" the tribe drops music to remember on this 14 track release. Ali Shaheed Muhammeds beats are ill, and Q-Tip and Phife Dawg come across with introspective, thought provoking & intelligent lyricism. To be honest it took me a look time to absorb this album, its not exactly a joint you blast while cruising in the ride, to me its more an album to listen carefully to through and through. Some of the tracks that stand out the most for me are the sick "Verses from the Abstract", a track about the game called "Show Business", the controversial "The Infamous Date Rape", and "Check the Rhime" which is about being .... over for a record deal. Jazz (We've Got) is my favourite track love the way it flows. A Tribe Called Quest comes out innovative and memorable on "The Low End Theory" an excellent release from one of Hip Hops most talented groups.

A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Phife Dawg) third album "Midnight Marauders" (1993) is a Hip-Hop classic. Two of the early Rap albums I got as gifts, were this release and Tribe's previous album "The Low End Theory" (1991). Being [..]back then I did not really absorb the lyrics till years later, what I loved then and still love today was the production, the way Tribe infused an unforgettable blend of Rap, Funk and Jazz. The short intro "Midnight Marauders Tour Guide" echoes in my head years later, which is followed up the upbeat "Steve Biko" (Stir It Up). "Award Tour" is simply outstanding; love the beat, chorus, and lyrics to this cut. The beats get darker and the topics more substantial on cuts like "8 Million Stories", "Suck N****" and "Midnight". Then Tribe flips it back to more laidback tracks starting with the party cut "We Can Get Down", which is followed by the excellent "Electric Relaxation" a track that has Tribe talking to the ladies backed by an addictive beat. The Tribe continued to shine on "Oh My God", the smooth "The Chase Pt 2" and "Lyrics to Go". The closing track "God Lives Through" finishes the album off on a high note. Reflective, fun and intelligent lyricism matched with Ali Shaheed Muhammad's out of this world production make "Midnight Marauders" an album I recommend for every collection.

Little Brother's debut album "The Listening" is off the hook. Right now this remains my favourite album this year, the combination of memorable and entertaining lyricism, sick beats, smooth background vocals and tight production make this an album to have. The North Carolina trio of MC's Phonte, Big Pooh and producer 9th Wonder deliver music to remember. After a short intro, "Groupie PT. 2" gets things started, a track with an insanely nice background beat, and humorous commentary from Cesar Comanche. Little Brother rep themself well on "For You", which is followed up by the exceptional "Speed" a calm track where Little Brother talk about rapping dropping lines like "I write rhymes to incite minds" while mentioning other rappers like Brand Nubian and Hi-Tek. "Whatever You Say" and "Yo-Yo" have LB's talking to and about the ladies, both are decent, I like the chorus on the first. "Shorty on The Lookout" is a laid back positive track to nod to. "Love Joint Revisted" is a track where Little Brother show mad love. Next track "So Faboulous" has vocals from L.E.G.A.C.Y. and Stacy Powell, and vibes well. My favourite track at the moment is the standout "The Way You Do It" which has a memorable mellow beat, and a excellent chorus. Another outstanding track is "Away from Me" a song where Little Brother goes real deep, talking about going seperate ways with friends and loved ones. Upbeat "Nobody But You" which is about real love follows, and benefits from impressive vocals by Keisha Shontelle. "Midnight Maneuvers" is decent and is followed up by the albums closer and title track, a track where Little Brother talk about how some rap fans do not value good music. Chances are you will not find this album at your local music store, I could not- so I got it here and I am more then happy I did. This reviewer highly recommends adding Little Brother's "The Listening" to your Hip Hop collection.

DMX's fourth album "The Great Depression" (2001), continues the saga of Yonkers MC Earl Simmons. Alot of rappers fall off, but X is still keeping it real and surviving and thriving three years after his first album. Album begins with "School Street" a shoutout/dedication track to fallen friends. Next comes "Who we Be" which uses a repetitive heavy bass beat, while X talks about his trials and tribulations. Next comes "Trina Moe", another banging track, where X talks about how alot of rappers talk about nothing important (cars,hoes,watches), and are not real with there people. The lead single "We Right Here" is another banging hiphop album which brings back the X we all know and love from past albums, dark and memorable. "Shorty was Da Bomb" continues X's pattern of dropping at least one track about the ladies, its entertaining,funny and X sings on it which surprisingly sounds good. "Damien III", has X facing Damien for the first time, and asking for the lords help for first time, another good track, kind of shows how X is progressing, love the way X sounds on this one. "When I'M Nothing" feat. Stephanine Mills, starts off real well, and X drops real nice verse on it, but Mills messes track up, with annoying vocal sound. "I Miss You" feat. Faith Evans is a powerfull track dedicated to X's grandmother, family, and religon. P. Killer produced "Ima Bang" is a blazing hot track, good track to bump in the ride. "Minute for your Son" closes off the album, with X thanking the lord, and all though it might not be the entertainment some want, it is a really positive track, and a rarity in hiphop, a track that is REALLY dedicated to God, X talks about being very happy for the first time in years. What I like about this album is DMX stays real, he doesnt just follow the same boring format some rappers do, never changing there styles, never taking the risk, and in the end just selling out to sell more, instead he changes up and stays real to himself, even if its not the commerical or pure hardcore album some want. End of last track is extended, and displays artists from X's bloodline label. Not a classic album, because it does have some weaknesses, and at times is slow, but overall its another strong effort from one of Hiphops best.

Erykah Badu's "Baduizm" (1997) is a strong first debut from a talented singer. I came across this album by accident, a friend borrowed my ride while I was on vacation and left the cd behind. Some of the tracks that stand out for me include: "On & On" a relaxed soulful track with a mellow beat, Badu's vocals are addictive, the slow moving and powerful "Other Side of the Game" a track where Badu talks about a boyfriend whos in the game, and drops chorus of what you going to do when they come for you- they being the boys in blue. Really like both of these tracks, favourite goes to the first. Some more tracks I like include "Next Lifetime" where Badu addresses temptation, the simple but nice "4 Leaf Clover" and the somewhat sad "Drama". No tracks are bad on this release, though I would of liked to see some more tracks on it, considering I stumbled upon it I am glad to have it.I enjoy listening to "Baduizm" when I am kicking it with my girl. Recommend it to R & B lovers.

1999 saw the release of Tupac Shakur's 3rd post-death release "Still I Rise" and first album featuring the Outlawz offically though they had appeared on many of his previous releases individually. The Outlawz consist of Young Noble, E.D.I., Kastro (Pacs Cousin) Kadafi (R.I.P.) and Napolean. They were his real life boys who grew up with him and who he brought into the game. Albums begins with track "Letter to the President", nice banger and good track to star the album. "Still I Rise" is a powerful track, where Pac talks about his father, the darkness of the world, and growing up hard. "Baby Dont Cry" (Keep Ya Head Up II) was the lead single on the album and is an important track with a message: keep on trying no matter what, never give up no matter how hard the road is. "As the World Turns", "Black Jesus", "Hell 4 a Hustla", "High Speed" follow and are all nice memorable tracks. "The Good Die Young" talks about life and death, and the Outlawz give shoutouts to lost friends, and family and remember. This track is relative, Tupac was only 26 when he died, and Kadafi was 19. "Killminati" is an upbeat track, and brings you back to nicer times. "You can be Touched" is a real powerful track, and the Outlawz come powerful, each one dropping nice verses including Hussein Fatal, a former member of the Outlawz who fell out of grace. "Y'All Dont Know Us" closes off the album and reminds the world that Pac may be gone but the Outlawz are going to continue his legacy. Overall this album is full of ill tracks, and I think Tupac would be happy with the way his boys represent for him. This is definetly an album to have in the collection if your a Pac fan.

DMX aka Earl Simmons album &quot;And Then There Was X&quot; continues his run of dropping banging albums. In this case it was his third album in under two years. Prolific. &quot;One More Road to Cross&quot; is laced with nice beats, courtesy of Swizz Beats, and X drops raw lyrics, with an addictive chorus. &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Here we Go Again&quot; follow. The first has X talking about fame, and coming up, the second has X talking about a street dilemma. &quot;Party Up&quot; is another nice track, with beats provided again from Swizz. &quot;What these Bitches want&quot; feat. Sisqo brings one of the nicest blends of hardcore hiphop and R&amp;B. &quot;Whats my Name&quot; produced by Irv Gotti, shows DMXs ability to work with any beat and do it well, to the background of grand piano chords, DMX rhymes with an ill flow and gets the listner pumped. &quot;Dont you Ever&quot; and &quot;Comin for You&quot; continue the pace set by &quot;Whats my Name&quot;. &quot;D-X-L&quot; feat Dragon and Lox, is one of the tracks that could of been left off the album another is the closer &quot;Good Girls,Bad Guys&quot; which is a garbage track. &quot;Prayer III&quot;continues X pattern of finishing album with a prayer. &quot;Angel&quot; feat. Regina Bell (Irv Gotti produced) is the 2nd to last track and would have been a good closer, its about classic good evil/battle and God. Memorable track with good replay value. X's first two albums were classics, this third album could been a classic if more time had been spent on production, and a few tracks could of been left off. All the same its not an album to miss if your an X fan, has hot beats, tight production, memorable lyrics and DMX's classic flow.

In all honesty Nice &amp; Smooth were really before my time, I was ten when there second album &quot;Ain't a Damn Thing Changed&quot; (1991) dropped. What drew me to this album over a decade later is the hit single &quot;Sometimes I Rhyme Slow&quot; which I had the pleasure of hearing awile back. Nice &amp; Smooth created a very memorable track with this one, blending smooth lyrics and an addictive chorus with the end result being a track you never get tired of hearing. One thing I realize when listening to this is that some oldschool hip hop was more relaxed and friendly then what we are hearing today, the opening track &quot;Harmonize&quot; being a good example of that. Nice &amp; Smooth soulfully sing and rhyme over a chilled out beat on the outstanding &quot;Cake &amp; Eat It Too&quot; a track about a woman who needs to choose between two men. They then pick up the pace on fastpaced tracks like &quot;Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Paranoia&quot; while dropping upbeat jams on cuts like &quot;How to Flow&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. I also have to say I am impressed by the beats. I think another reviewer has a good point in saying that artists like Gregg Nice and Smooth Bee helped pave the way for rap to enter the mainstream by delivering music with crossover appeal. While they dont have the impact on Hip Hop of Rakim, KRS etc they did play a role. Recommend checking out this album if you appreciate the oldschool.

Mystic's debut album "Cuts for Luck and Scars for Freedom" (2001) is an impressive not to be slept on release. Mystic is a female Rapper/Singer hailing from Oakland, California. Mystic reminds me of other talented female MC's like Lauryn Hill & Jean Grae. Mystic keeps her audience listening throughout from the laidback intro to the closing bonus cut "Destiny Complete this is an MC who has deep and relevant music to deliver. Over some ominous sounding production Mystic drops thoughts on corruption and the ghetto environment many people live in. My favourite track on this release is "Neptune's Jewels, Mystic delivers a refreshing love ballad, with on point rhymes and soulful singing. On "The Gotta's" Mystic paint's a picture of a young street soldier and the life he lives, in pursuit of money, sex, love and respect. The following track is the upbeat "The Life", Mystic sings soulfully providing another memorable joint. Mystic flips the script on "Once A Week", being the women who's looking for a casual relationship no strings attached. Mystic slows things down with another love ballad in "Forever and A Day", while taking the perspective of a hustler/killer on "D Boy". "You Say, I Say" is another track about relationship's. Throughout this album Mystic delivers deep track's, "A Dream" is one of these, Mystic's lyrics/singing are outstanding on this sad cut about struggle and overcoming. Mystic collaborates with Planet Asia for "W", in a track about their home state California. Powerful is the best way to describe "Fallen Angel's", a track about death dedicated to those who have lost people to violence, domestic abuse, drugs and murder. Mystic talks to the women who find love in the wrong places on "Girlfriend Sistagirl". Mystic reflects on her life, getting raped, remembering her drug addict father who abandoned her on "Fatherless Child", nothing's simple in this track about love and pain. Mystic talk's to people who have suffered in life on "O.K. Alright", while dropping some introspective words's on "Spoken Words". Mystic provides conscious and quality music on "Cuts for Luck and Scars for Freedom" a album which I recommend checking out. I think women will especially enjoy/relate to this release.

Naughty by Nature's (Treach, Vinnie, Kay Gee) third album "Poverty's Paradise" (1995) is an banging underated release that still vibes very well many years later. Executive production comes from Naughty by Nature, Sha-Kim & Queen Latifah. Guest appearances come from Road Dawgs, Cruddy Click, Rottin Razkalz, Chriss Webber, Gordon Chambers. On the insert to the cd there is a comment I like from Treach which runs as "You could Leave the Ghetto, But the Ghetto Ain't Gonna Leave You. It's in you forever, If you keep in touch". The albums title track, is a one minute track which has Naughty by Nature reminding there fans that they will always remember there roots, and stay grounded, and that they will represent for those who dont get a voice out there. First tracks that standout for me are upbeat party tracks like "Clap Yo Hands" & "It's Workin" feat. Rottin Razkalz tracks which have nice choruses and are entertaining. On "Chain Remain" NBN goes deeper showing there social consciousness, talking about incarceration, and dropping lines like "Jails aint nothing but the slave day sequel". The lighter "Feel Me Flow" follows, a very nice laid back party track. "Craziest" has NBN showing love to people from city's from NJ to Boston. Another track follows in "Sunshine" which has an addictive beat, and is a track about showing love to the shortys, and getting laid. "World Goes Round" is a track about the youth, cops, media, and the streets. Naughty by Nature shows there harder side on "Klickow-Klickow" feat. Rottin Razkals, Cruddy Click, Road Dawgz while paying some respect to the oldschool. The albums longest track is the seven minute "Shout Out" feat. R&B singer Gordon Chambers a track by Naughty by Nature in which they thank the radio programmers, video shows, DJ and fans that supported there music and helped them make it, while also thanking individuals like Funkmaster Flex, DJ Premier, and many many more. I like this, never have seen a track where a group shows so much love to those who helped them make it and to other artists, while getting specific and being genuine. Next comes outro, which you would think would be closer, cept it isnt as the hardcore "Connections" closes the album off well. "Poverty's Paradise" has music to party to, music that makes you think, and music that goes deeper then the average. Beats, production and lyrics are all solid making this an album to have if you like Naughty by Nature like I do.

Its been four years since Gang Starr (Guru, DJ Premier) dropped an album (Full Clip 1999), and five since they dropped an album with completly new material (Moment of Truth 1998). I keep "Moment of Truth" and "Daily Operation" on regular rotation as they are two of my favourite group hiphop albums, and in my opinion classics. I have been looking forward to there seventh album "Ownerz" ever since I heard the track "Skillz" on the radio. Over the years DJ Premier has established himself as one of the best if not the best producer in the game doing tracks for many artists. Guest appearances come from Krumbsnatcha, Smiley, Jadakiss, Boy Big, Fat Joe, M.O.P., Big Shug, Freddie Foxx, NYG'z, H.Stax, Snoop Dogg and Uncle Reo. Premier handles production from start to finish. Standout tracks for me include "Werdz From The Ghetto Child" Feat. Smiley a short track, where Smiley (an arist I have not heard before) rips the track, "Right where you Stand" Feat. Jadakiss the best collab track on the album, love the way Guru and Jada flow toghether, the Jazzed up "Deadly Habitz","Peace of Mine" a dark track where Guru kicks some insightful knowledge and calls out fake mcs, the banging "Playtawin", pumped up "Riot akt" and "In This Life" feat Snoop Dogg & Uncle Reo- funny never thought I would see Snoop collabing with Gang Starr but I like it, Uncle Reo comes across nice on the hook. One thing I felt about this album is it did not start or finish as well as it could, "Eulogy" has the same sound as "Moment of Truths" last track "In Memory Of". Also some of the guest appearances like Fat Joe, Krumbsnatcha, Freddie Fox and Big Shugs were dissapointing for me. "Nice Girl Wrong Place" feat. Boy Big is the albums R & B/rap collab track and I dont feel it like I did "Royalty", it would of been nice to see KC & Jojo drop in for a reunion track, I guess Gang Starrs staying original though and giving a new artist a break. Overall "Ownerz" has alot of banging tracks, production is tight as usual and Guru drops some memorable verses, its nice to see one of hiphops illest groups dropping there seventh album, on whats been an amazing fourteen year run, and its not over yet.

50 Cent's debut EP &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot; (2000) is ill. You know 50 Cent has so much overexposure these days, and with that one cannot help getting tired of hearing tracks like &quot;In Da Club&quot; when they are played excessively on the radio. One of the things I like about 50 is he came up from nothing and made it big, listening to his past work was refreshing. I only came across this release after 50 Cent blew, the first time I heard 50 was on &quot;How to Rob&quot; which was featured on the &quot;In Too Deep Soundtrack&quot;, back then my first thoughts were this is most likely a talentless cat just trying to get his fifteen minutes by creating controversy and tearing into other MC's. Since then my view has changed ,50 Cent does create controversy but at the same time he is an entertaining, hard working, talented and at times humorous artist, who deserved to blow and made it on his own when the record executives turned there back on him. This EP has a hungry 50 dropping some memorable rhymes, backed by some impressive production. 50 starts the album off strong with early tracks like &quot;The Hit&quot; &amp; &quot;Good Die Young&quot;, the later has 50 talking about how close death can be, its all relative especially considering 50 got blasted and almost died just before this one was supposed to drop. &quot;Your Life's on the Line&quot; is another standout, and 50's collabration with Bun B &quot;As the World Turns&quot; is a good cut. Laidback &quot;Ghetto Quaran&quot; flows through smoothly, 50 takes things back in his day talking about life in his hood, giving shout outs, and paying tribute to those who passed. 50 reps himself cockily on &quot;Da Repercussions&quot; and drops another solid cut with &quot;Make Money by Any Means&quot;. 50 then addresses the ladies who are in it for the money on &quot;Material Girl&quot; and collabrates with Destiny's Child on the laidback &quot;Thug Love&quot;. &quot;Gun Runner&quot; is a grimey track where 50 kicks some gun knowledge and finishes the track with a jack. My favourite track on this album is the excellent title track &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot;, the beat, 50 lyrics and chorus all make this a cut to remember. 50 drops some of the rules of the game on &quot;I'm a Hustler&quot;, while using Jadakiss and Jay-Z samples. The album closes off with &quot;How to Rob&quot;, nowadays I feel this track more, maybe because I know what 50's about. Overall I highly recommend &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot; to 50 Cent fans, and to those who want to see what 50 Cent was like before he exploded on the Rap scene.

Bob Marley was long before my time, he died when I was one week old, but that really does not matter, his music is classic and timeless. This was the first Reggae CD I had ever bought and I think it will probably be the best one I ever get. Fourteen tracks total "Legend" has a nice mix of songs, love songs, songs about poltics and and oppression, and songs about empoyerment. "No Woman No Cry" really stands out for me as one of the nicest tracks on the album, a political song about oppression with a powerful chorus that makes you sing along, with a good message which is something along lines of never give up, keep your faith, keep your hope. "Three Little Birds" has a similar message, and is a melodic feel good song. "Buffalo Soldier" is a song about slavery and black men fighting for American Independence", Bob Marley is dropping some history knowledge on this one, songs got a really catchy sound. "Get Up Stand Up" uses a heavy bass groove, and is a fast paced track that is about fighting oppression. "Stir it up" is a relaxed slow love track, which has nice grooves and rhythm."One Love" combines piano and guitar, and is a positive feel good song about loving the lord, loving each other. "I Shot the Sheriff" is a powerful song about oppression in Jamaica, first heard this song remixed by Warren G, like this original alot more. "Redemption Song" is a sad and wonderful song, about fighting for freedom, Marley uses Acoustic Guitar, and though the song has a sad sound, its deep and moving. "Exodus" uses organ, continous guitar rifts, and horns, and is a fast paced track. "Jamming" is a great track to close off the album, a relaxed track with a laid back groovy sound too it. "Bob Marley's "Legend" is an excellent album, and if you are to buy just one Reggae album get this one.

Boyz'N the hood is a very memorable movie, remember watching it when it first came out, recently I decided to add it to my DVD collection. Actors Cuban Gooding J.R. (Trey), Lawerence Fishburne (Furious), Ice Cube (Dough Boy), Nia Long, Morris Chestnut (Ricky) deliver a very moving and powerful movie. John Singleton gets directing credit for this amazing movie. As some have already said this is not a gangster movie, this is a movie about growing up poor in South Central LA, and the survival needed to make it, its also about the relation between a father and his son (Trey &amp; Furious), and about two of Trey's friends who have no father, brothers Ricky and Doughboy- one the rising football star, the other the local hood. To there mother, one can do no wrong, and the other is always in the wrong. Movie has some really positive moments, one of my favourites is when Trey and his pops are riding in the car, and listening to Five Stairsteps &quot;Ooh Child&quot; a classic soul song. Another thing that makes characters stand out is watching them develop from boys to men. Tragedy strikes in the movie, and Trey goes to look for revenge, then stops himself coming to realization that thats not the choice he wants to make in life. &quot;Boyz 'N the Hood&quot; is a good movie, that will keep you captivated from start to finish.

Tupac Shakurs latest post-death album "Better Dayz" continues the legacy of hiphops most loved MC. Another double album, twenty five tracks in total with guest appearances from well known artists like Trick Daddy, Nas, Mya, Tyrese, his crew the outlawz, Big Syke, and more appearances from less artist like T.I., B.D.I., Kimmy Hill, Nutso, A.Hamilton, Mr. Biggs, Buckshot, and BB brothers. Executive produced by Afeni Shakur and Suge Knight, some of the producers include 7 Aurelius, Johnny J, DJ Quick, BRISS & Jazze Pha. 1st single is "Thugz Mansion", second is "My Block" (remix). Recordings from this album come from the period 1994-1996, the last two years of Shakurs life. As a Pac fan who is followed him from the beginning, been waiting for this album ever since his last recording "Untill the end of Time". Album starts with raw thugged out tracks like "Still Balling", "When we ride on our Enemies", "F**K em all", classic pac emotional, angry in some cases and always entertaining. On "Mamas Just a Little Girl", Pac shows his softer side, with inspirational thought provoking music. "Street Fame" is another hardcore track, next comes "Fair Exchange" an upbeat track, where Pac talks to the ladies, "Late Night" is a laid back mellow party track. "Ghetto Star" and "Thugz Mansion" feat. Nas Acoustic close off disc one well. These 13 tracks alone could make a complete album. "My Block" (Remix) the albums second single is a track about the ghetto, and growing up poor, track is thought provoking and reflective track, one of those tracks you can replay over and over again. Next comes "Thugz Mansion" that track you will hear on the radio, produced by 7 Aurelius, another nice track. Next comes "Never Call U "B**** again" feat. Tyrese, nice Rap/R&B collab track. This is followed by the title track "Better Dayz" which uses Isley brother vocals, which at the moment is my favourite track. "There you Go", "This Life I Lead", "Who do you Believe In" all standout on Disc 2, and the album is closed well with "They dont give a F*** about us". Beats, Vocals, Lyrics, and Production tight all throughout, making "Better Dayz" another classic from raps legendary MC.

A Tribe Called Quest's (Q-Tip, Phife, Ali Shaheed Muhammad) fourth album was "Beats, Rhymes & Life" (1996). Following the release of three albums I consider classics ATCQ dropped this solid fifteen-track release after a three-year hiatus. Jay Dee (R.I.P.) teamed up with Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhamammad for "The Ummah" and helped with production on this release. My favourite track on this one is "Stressed Out", ATCQ and Faith Evans collaborate for an outstanding track. Faith Evans really impressed me on this cut, her soulful singing is excellent. Backed by some sick production ATCQ shine on cuts like "Jam", "1nce Again" and "What Really Goes On". Overall their is a notable change in production (more hard, less upbeat) and lyrics, less Jazz oriented cuts (the type I love), and more serious lyrics in my opinion. I don't consider "Beats, Rhymes & Life" to be among ATCQ's best work, it does however have some memorable moments, and some impressive production, which makes it a keeper for any big ATCQ fan. A Tribe Called Quest 1988-1998.

R. Kelly's "I Believe I can Fly" (1996) is an amazing song. One of the most powerful, memorable and inspiring tracks I have come across. To me this track is a motivator- that one can overcome anything that comes there way, and excel to reach great heights. Recognized as a hit globally, this song is definitely one of R. Kelly's best if not his best. Replay value remains strong as ever years later. Performed and Composed by R. Kelly for the Space Jam Soundtrack, this is a truly exceptional song which can also be found on his 1998 album "R.".

Tupac Shakur's "R U Still Down? (Remember Me)" came out in 1997, one year after his passing. Production could of been better on this album, but lyrics and 26 tracks definetly make it an album for the collection if your a pac fan. Nice tracks on disc one include the title track "R U still Down?", "Hellrazor" a powerfull track with sick beats as an angry Pac lays down memorable lyrics. "I wonder if Heaven Got a Ghetto" is an upbeat track where Pac talks about growing up, making money, and thug life. "Nothing to Lose" is another ill track, Pac verses "Walk a mile in my shoes and you would be crazy too". "Im getting money", [and other songs] close off disc one well. Disc 2 comes next, third track "Hold on Be Strong", is an upbeat track sort of like "Keep Ya Head Up". "Do for Love" feat. Eric Williams (of blackstreet) is a deep and memorable track about love. "16 on Death Row" is a powerfull harcore track. "When I get free II" and "Only fear of Death" are both nice tracks and close off the album well. "R U still Down" is really an album dedicated to thug life, and Pac comes across powerfully, hes less poetic and less philosophical on this album then previous and later releases, this album is gangster rap at its best. What makes some of the later post-death albums (Untill the end of Time, Better Dayz) better in my opinion is they cover the time period (1994-1996) right before his death, while this album covers music from 1991-1994 period, when he was still progressing as an artist. "R U still Down" may not be for everyone, but if you love Pac like I do, you will appreciate this album.

Guru, half of the legendary duo Gangstarr delivers his own independent solo album "Version 7.0. The Street Scriptures" (2005). Guru teamed up with Solar for production on this album. Guest appearances come from Doo Wop, Styles P, Jaguar Wright, Jean Grae, Talib Kweli and B Real. After "No Time", Guru proceeds to call out "False Prophets" backed by an ominous beat. Lox rapper Styles P and Guru team up for the grimy "Don Status" which is followed up by the short "Hood Dreamin". The single "Cave In" follows, Guru rhymes over a fast paced frenetic beat. Guru reminisces on the standout "Surviving Tha Game", telling a story of survival, while dropping some introspective lyrics. Jaguar Wright provides some smooth vocals for the laidback "Talk To Me", while Guru talks to the ladies. One of my favorites is the sentimental "Too Dark To See", Guru tells his own story of being down and making it back. Cypress Hill's B-Real drops in for the decent "Real Life". I have always respected Guru's social conscious, "Feed the Hungry" is a track dedicated to helping the poor and hopeless. On the other hand he doesn't shun the glamour life and getting paid, as he shows on "Open House". Guru closes off his album on a strong note with "What's My Life Like?". Guru the MC hasn't changed that much to me, he still drops insightful rhymes, and he is still cocky. Production is stellar, nothing groundbreaking or particularly gripping, nothing to disappointing. One can't really compare anyone to Premo in my books, but like Guru said in a recent interview they felt it was time to move on. Happy to see Guru still at it, recommend checking out "Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures". 3.5.

It took me five years to get this album, and now I am definetly glad to have Gang Starr's &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; in the collection. DJ Premier for years has laced many an album and many a track with sick beats, this album being a perfect example, nobody does beats like Premo. Guru drops memorable, meaningfull, thought provoking lyrics all throughout this album, making this a quality joint and in my opinion a Classic. From the first track &quot;You Know My Steez&quot; to the last &quot;In Memory of..&quot; Gang Starr drops twenty sick tracks. From the start tracks like &quot;Robin Hood Theory&quot; has Guru kicking knowledge to the youth about the youth, with ideas like young ppl need the right education, freedom, and to follow religion whatever religion you choose, and that there needs to be more equality in this world, that something is wrong when so many people are poor. &quot;Royalty&quot; feat. KC &amp; Jojo is a blazing hot Rap R &amp; B collabration about showing love to real women. &quot;Above the Clouds&quot; feat. Wu-Tangs &quot;Inspectah Deck&quot; is another crazy track. The albums title track &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; is well chosen as it is one of the best, Premier drops a sick beat, and Guru drops deep and memorable lyrics. &quot;What I am here for&quot; is a timeless song, full of positivity. &quot;She knows what She Wantz&quot; has got a sick beat, and Guru drops some thought provoking lyrics about the ladies, that a lot of young guys should listen to,always think of the one before the two, unless its real. &quot;New York Street Talk&quot; is a track about coming up small time and making it in the game. &quot;My advice 2 you&quot; is about making the right choices, another sick track. Album closes off with &quot;Next Time&quot; a track reminding other MCs that Gang Starr will take out all contenders, and &quot;In Memory..&quot; is a track dedicated to lost family and friends, those in jail, to those in the streets and to fallen MCs. In there cd inset Gang Starr shows alot of love to new and old mcs, friends and fam, good to see, just another example of how grounded they are. Gang Starr's &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; is classic hiphop, an album for anyone who loves Hiphop at its best.

Menace II Society is the story of Caine (Tyrin Turner) a young man living in Watts, Los Angeles. From the very beginning of the movie we follow Caine with an early flashback to his childhood to start . Caines narrative voice is found all throughout this movie. Things start off violent, and never really stop, from beginning to end there is bloodshed, but theres alot more than just violence in this movie, Caine lives a day to day existence, and its only in the end that he realizes whats important to him- Ronnie (Jada Pinkett), her son, his family and living. Other main character is Caines best friend 0-Dog (Larenz Tate) who is young, black and doesnt [care], his presence in movie is really a powerful one, and his lack of conscience contrasts with Caines. Movie also stars Vonte Sweet, Samuel L. Jackson and Glenn Plummer. Produced by Darin Scott & the Hughes Brothers. Tyrin Turner a still virtually unknown actor is excellent in this movie, and in my opinion deserves alot more credit than he has gotten.To say this movie is just powerful is an understatment, and to compare it to Boyz N the Hood is wrong too. There are some similarities, but Menace II Society is alot darker, and wasnt made to please the masses. Maybe thats why I like it so much, because the story is realistic and the makers dont play down the violence to get mainstream appeal. Would like to talk about some of key scenes but you dont do that when writing a review for people who havnt seen the movie, all I will say is this movie is definetly worth watching, and if your like me and really enjoy it, its worth having in the collection.

Twista's latest album is "Kamikaze" (2004). Hailing from Chicago, Twista is a Rap veteran who has finally managed to get the support of a label (Atlantic) that can market him properly to the mainstream. Guest appearances come from: 8 Ball,Too Short,Ludacris, Kayne West, Jamie Foxx, Jazze Pha, Freeway, Bennie Franks, Danny Boy, T.I., Liffy Strokes, Cee Lo, Anthony Hamilton, Memphis Bleek and Young Chris. Twista tears up the opening track "Get Me", showing his hunger for the game, love for his city while facing his haters. Next he takes things back to his Adrenaline Rush days with "Kill Us All". The lead single is the standout love track "Slow Jamz" feat. Kayne West and Jamie Foxx. It was good to see this cut explode on the radio, its a memorable collabration, what surprised me most about it was that Comedian/Actor Jamie Foxx can sing well. Next two tracks "Get That Doe" (Ain't It Man) and "Still Feels So Good" flow through nicely. Can't say I am really feeling "Drinks" or "Badunkadunk", both seem like filler. Thankfully "One Last Time" picks things up again, Twista's fastpaced flow and chorus shine on this cut. Freeway and Beenie Franks drop in for another good cut with "Show's Over". Ludacris distinct drawl mixed with Twista's trademark flow makes "Higher" an intresting collabration, whether you like this one or not you most likely will remember it. "Snoopin" feat. Danny Boy is a chilled out Rap/R & B collabration. Twista gets reflective on the substantial thought provoking "Hope" feat. Cee Lo, the messages within this track are very positive, this tracks special because Twista absolutely takes things to another level with real and relevant lyrics and Cee-Lo delivers a memorable chorus. Twista and R&B singer Anthony Hamilton drop a nice rendition of a well known track with the upbeat "Lovely Day" (which takes me back to the hit "Player Holiday"). Twista is on good terms with Dame Dash and Rocafella (who want to sign him) so it makes sense that he link up with Rocafellas Memphis Bleek, Young Chris and Freeway for "Art and Life". I have to say I am impressed by this one, it's good to see that Twista is getting the chance to get the commercial attention he deserves after years of being in the background. There are a few tracks I dont feel on this IE "Like a 24", however the majority are good giving this album continuity. The mix of diverse musical cuts make "Kamikaze" a refreshing album which I highly recommend for the collection.

50 Cent's latest musical release is the "Get Rich Or Die Tryin'" (2005) Soundtrack. 50 (AKA Curtis Jackson) enlisted the whole G-Unit Family for this one with Lloyd Banks, Spider Loc, Young Buck, M.O.P., Olivia, Tony Yayo, Mase and Mobb Deep all making appearances. R & B hook singer Nate Dogg also makes an appearance. I feel like 50 Cent & Co dug deep when creating this release, almost like he rewound the clock some years back to when he was an unknown delivering raw music. The album's opener "Hustler's Ambition" is blazing hot, 50 rhymes with hunger, while lacing the track with his own impressive chorus, the end result is a premium cut. The follow up track "What If" is a more laidback, 50 lays questions down while talking about other rappers and singers, a minor snub is sent AZs way. Lloyd Banks and Spider Loc then team up with 50 Cent for the grimy "Things Change". Backed by a pounding beat 50 then collabs with Young Buck and Banks on "You Already Know". 50 teams up with M.O.P. for the outstanding, "When Death Becomes You" one of those tracks that you blast in the whip. Next two cuts are average and have 50 collabing with Mobb Deep and Olivia, and then Young Buck delivers a standout on solo with "Don't Need No Help" dropping his opinion of the law. I am not a big Yayo fan, but he surprised me delivering an excellent track with "Fake Love", feeling the lyrics and beat to this cut. 50 provides another solid track with "Window Shopper", some people may have heard an unofficial version of this one which has 50 calling out Ja Rule, Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe. Lloyd Banks provides another thugged out track with "Born Alone, Die Alone" while Havoc and Prodigy collab with 50 again for "You a Shooter". The album's biggest collaboration has 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Prodigy, Spider Loc and Mase working together for "I Don't Know Officer". 50 then puts himself in the perspective of people (enemies, relatives, his son) he knows or knew delivering their opinions on him with "Talk About Me". "When It Rains It Pours" is laced with a sad sounding beat, and has 50 talking to a lil homie. The upbeat "Best Friend" follows, 50 sings to a lady on a smooth track that reminds me of past ballads of his. The album closes off with another banger as 50 and Young Buck tag team "I'll Whip Ya Head Boy". My favourite tracks on this one are "Hustler's Ambition" and "When Death Becomes You". Overall I think the "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" Soundtrack will accompany the movie well; I recommend this release to fans of 50 Cent and G-Unit.

After six albums Ja Rule has released a eighteen track compilation of his hits with "Exodus" (2005). Three new tracks are included. The opener "Exodus" (Intro) has Ja Rule recollecting on years past, talking about his rise in the rap game and the ups and downs his label has experienced, Irv Gotti finishes off the track with some words of his own. "Me" has Ja Rule addressing the haters, and artists who hated on his style then copied it, while talking to the ladies. I remember when Rule dropped his debut album "Venni Vetti Vecci", loved that album, the banging "Holla Holla", "It's Murda" and heartfelt "Daddy's Little Baby" feat. Ron Isley are included on this release. All are good tracks, though that release has ones I like more. Ja Rule's first real commercial album was "Rule 3:36", hits "Put It On Me" feat. Vita, the deep "I Cry" Feat. Lil Mo and "Love Me, Hate Me" (a track that some fickle fans should listen to) are included. The feel good "Livin It Up", smooth "Always on Time" and dark "Never Again" are three additions from Rule's 3rd album "Pain Is Love". The first Ja Rule release that I was not impressed with was "The Last Temptation", "Thug Loving" feat. Bobby Brown and "Mesmerize" feat. Ashanti were to typical for me at that time, while the rest of that album was forgettable. Rule made a return to making less commercial music with his fifth album "Blood in My Eye" which was really a reply to all the hate he was experiencing, the single "Clap Back" is a solid track and the only track from that album that made this release. "R.U.L.E." had Ja Rule back in good form, the blazing hot "New York" had Rule, Jadakiss and Fat Joe bringing the heat while R Kelly and Ashanti helped deliver the smooth "Wonderful". As far as I know "Ain't It Funny" did not end up on any Rule albums, its similar to Rule's other collab with J.Lo, and includes an appearance from Cadillac Tah. Rule closes off this release with "Exodus" (Outro), talking about being who he is, the hate he experienced, and the case the feds have been pursuing the Inc on. Last week the Gottis, founders of Ja Rule's label Murda Inc were aquitted in that money laundering case. Fans can expect to see Rule with a new name (Loki), new distribution deal and new album next year.

Big Pooh's (AKA Thomas Jones) debut album is "Sleepers" (2005). Pooh is one third of the North Carolina group Little Brother. The albums first standout track is the laidback single "Strongest Man", Pooh rhymes well over an ill beat, providing his own chorus. Big Pooh then tells a story of the streets on "Heart of The City". Pooh's LB rhyme partner Phonte drops in for the decent "Every Block", which is followed up by "Just Friends" a track where P talks about the ladies, remaining uncommitted and having fun. O-Dash and Darrien Brockington drop in for the smooth "In My Mind", this is my current favourite track, Pooh drops some deep lyrics backed by a memorable chorus. The pace picks up a bit on "Scars" a track which features appearances from Joe Scudda and Median. Pooh tells a hood story of child neglect, jealousy and murder on "The Jungle". The albums closing track has Big Pooh repping himself on "Fever". My thoughts on this album range- I enjoyed the production throughout, and from time to time Big Pooh shined (Strongest Man, In My Mind), at other times his content was forgettable, lacking in verses. I enjoy Phonte and Pooh more as a team, and am looking forward to "The Minstrel Show". Overall "Sleepers" is a decent debut album, which I recommend to fans of Little Brother.

ATB's (Andr&eacute; Tanneberger) sixth album is "Trilogy" (2007). As a reviewer I mostly write Hip Hop reviews, as a music listener I like to listen to music of all different genres. Like a lot of people I first came across Germany's ATB when he dropped his debut album "Movin' Melodies" (1999) which included the hit single "9 PM" (Till I Come). My favourite Trance artist is Tiesto though I have only really skimmed the surface of this particular music genre. My favourite track on this release is "The Chosen Ones" a track with a excellent vibe to it, singer Jan Lochel shines on this feel good melody - great lyrics, memorable vocals, while ATB's is production subtly outstanding. I have been getting a lot of play out of track's like the exceptional "Alcarda" and somber "Trilogy" (The Final Chapter). Female singers Jennifer Karr & Karen Ises deliver on point vocals on the album's opening track's "Justify" and the single "Desperate Religion". Heather Nova, who provides a number of contributions steals the show for me though on the deep "Stars Come Out" singing with passion on a track which may produce some tears from your girlfriend. Both disc's are full of laid back track's, and while this may upset those who are looking for more fast paced hard hitting production, I find that this release is solid throughout. This is not an album for those looking for dance track's. The second disc in particular has more chill music, instrumental's which have grown on this reviewer more with additional listens. "Trilogy" is a release I would recommend for the collection.

Commons 4th album &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; is another nice album from one of hiphops most insightful and deep storytellers.Full of Jazzy and soulful music, with commons distinct flow and lyrics. Guest appearances include Mos Def, The Roots, Slum Village, Bilal, Jill Scott, Mc Lyte,Roy Hargrave, Femi Kuti, D'Angelo, Cee-Lo, Lonnie Lynn. Production comes from ?uestlove, D'Angelo, James Poyser, Jay Dee, DJ Premier, Karim Riggins and the Roots. &quot;Dooinit&quot; is a powerfull track where Common talks about commericalized hiphop, unintentional or not this song was so contreversial it got Common banned NY Hot 97. &quot;The Light&quot; is a deep love song, alot of hiphop disrespects women today, Common really comes real when he talks about relationships and love, rap would be much more loved if more mcs followed his example. Mos Def and Commons &quot;The Questions&quot; is the nicest collab on the album, and both artists shine on this track. Favourite track on the album is the DJ Premier produced track &quot;6th Sense&quot; meaningful ill track, remincent of my all time favourite Common track &quot;I Used to Love H.E.R.&quot;. Tracks that follow like &quot;Thelonius&quot; , &quot;Payback is Grandmother&quot;, &quot;Song for Assata&quot; feat. Cee-Lo (A Cee-Lo I havnt seen before, very nice)to &quot;Pops Rap III&quot; continue the pace set nicely, and you dont want this album to end. You know an albums good when you can pop it in, and listen to it from start to finish without skipping anything, and thats the case with &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot;. Production, Lyrics, Guest Appearances, Beats are all excellent, a real enjoyable listening experience. Recommend this album to anyone that loves hiphop at its best.

Common's (Lonnie Rashid Lynn, Jr.) seventh album is "Finding Forever" (2007) a twelve track release from the Chi-Town MC. I have been a Common fan since I first heard "I Used to Love H.E.R." Guest appearances on this release come from Kayne West, Dwele, Lily Allen, Will.i.am, DJ Premier (scratches), Bilal, D'Angelo, and Common's old man - Lonnie "Pops" Lynn. Kayne West provides the majority of the album's production (8 tracks), with some additional contributions from Derrick Hodge, Will.i.am, Dilla & Devo Springsteen. A wide variety of sampling is found throughout this release. The album opens with a laidback instrumental intro, Common then gets things going with "Start The Show". The album's first single "The People" follows, Common drops a joint about himself, people on the everyday grind to make a living, singer Dwele provides some smooth background vocals. "Drivin' Me Wild" features an appearance from British Singer Lily Allen - not feeling this track - Common's lyrics are on point, Lily Allen's repetitive chorus gets old quick. Will.i.am drops in for the mellow "I Want You", then Common reps his city with pride on "Southside" feat. Kayne West a track which they debuted at Super Bowl XLI. Legendary producer DJ Premier scratching is borrowed by Kayne West on the album's second single "The Game". Common talks about the challenges/stereotypes Black people face on "U, Black Maybe". Those familiar with J Dilla's instrumental albums will recognize the "Bye" beat to the standout "So Far To Go" which features some soulful vocals from talented singer D'Angelo. Common speaks to the ladies again on "Break My Heart". Common shines on the Devo Springsteen produced "Misunderstood", providing a memorable track. My favourite track on this release is the closer "Forever Begins", which features an appearance from Common's pops Lonnie Lynn, and on point production from Kayne West. The UK version of this album features a great track called ""Play Your Cards Right" feat. Bilal, I would of liked to seen it provided on all versions. Another standout track not included is called "A Dream" feat. Will.i.am, which was used for the Freedom Writers soundtrack. Common provides another substantial album with "Finding Forever", recommend it for the collection.

In 1995 Brooklyn's AZ (aka Anthony Cruz) dropped his debut album "Doe or Die". A short twelve track release this is an excellent album full of memorable lyrics, beats and production. After the intro a hungry AZ rips up "Uncut Raw", a grimey track about the streets. The next two cuts are more laidback and both are outstanding, AZ rhymes over an ill beat on "Gimme Your's" then talks about money hungry women on "Ho Happy Jackie". Az excels in lyrically repping himself on "Rather Unique", then rhymes over a crazy beat on "I feel for You". AZ talks about life, death, his plans and ambitions backed by some smooth female vocals and an addictive beat on the sick "Sugar Hill". On "Illmatic" AZ and Nas dropped a classic collabration with "Life's a Bitch", on this album they drop another amazing track with "Mo Money, Mo Murder Homocide", both rhyme and AZ drops a premium chorus. The chemistry these two have is incredible and I am still waiting for that collabration album, hopefully that will happen one day. Az continues to shine on the title track then takes a change going political on the dark "We Can't Win". AZ then talks to and about incarcerated prisoners putting himself in there role on "Your World Don't Stop", to me theres a hopeful message behind it which is basically keep on going. Sugar Hill (Remix) closes off the album, its a good track but theres no way you can make the original better in my opinion. AZ lyrically shines on "Doe Or Die", this to me is his greatest album and one that I would recommend for any Hip Hop collection. People who love "Illmatic" should also love this album as its off the hook. AZ continues to be slept on by mainstream audiences but real fans appreciate gems like this release.

D'Angelo's (A.K.A. Michaela Eugene Archer) debut album was "Brown Sugar" (1995). D'Angelo is a multi-talented musician- singer, song writer pianist, guitarist and record producer. This short ten track release is an impressive groundbreaking album full of excellent music. The album's opener is the smooth title track "Brown Sugar", a feel good love track with a great vibe to it. The laid back "Alright" follows, D'Angelo laces the track with some soulful vocals. "Jonz In My Bonz" was composed by D'Angelo and his former girlfriend Angie Stone, who is also the mother of his son. One of my early favourites is "Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine", D'Angelo croons away. D'Angelo sings about the scenario of finding his best friend with his wife on "Sh*t, D***, Motherf**ker". "Smooth" is just that, while "Cruisin" has D'Angelo doing a cover on a Smokey Robinson classic - delivering another highlight track. Soulful ballads follow in "When We Get By" & Lady". My personal favourite track on this album is the closer "Higher", D'Angelo does take his audience higher with this exceptional song. It would take D'Angelo, five years to deliver another album, with Voodoo (2000) a solid album worth checking out. D'Angelo has dealt with some battles in recent year's whether it be with drugs and rehabilitation or nearly dying in a car crash, heard hes working on a new album wish him all the best with that. "Brown Sugar" is definitely the D'Angelo album to have, full of soulful feel good music, D'Angelo took his audience on a journey to remember.

Talib Kweli's latest release is "Right About Now: The Official Sucka Free Mix CD" (2005). I am happy to have his last three solo albums in my collection, as well as the Black Star album. Standouts on this release for me include "Ms. Hill", a powerful tribute to Lauryn Hill, the upbeat "Supreme" (Side to Side) where Mos Def and Talib reunite for yet another hot cut, and "Where Ya Gonna Run" - Jean Grae delivers. My favourite track is the laidback "Two & Two" where a reflective Talib opens up, talks about the industry and creates a memorable cut. I don't feel like Talib is getting the production he deserves, its simply lackluster and in some cases some of the beats are second rate. Remember what Hi-Tek did on Reflection Eternal? Now that was real quality production. On "Quality" and "The Beautiful Struggle" Talib got some premium beats. I also have a difference of opinion about an artist everyone is claiming to be next, Papoose ("The Beast") to me isn't anything special, he rhymes with a fast flow but is basically just a punch line MC, and not on the level of the likes of other up and coming MCs like Ali Vegas and Saigon. Anyways "Right About Now:The Official Sucka Free Mix Cd" should provide Kweli fans with their necessary fix for now, maybe I have unrealistic expectations but I expect more from Kweli, and look forward to him getting the support of a record label that can properly promote him and make sure he gets the support he deserves. 3.5.

Fans of hip hop have a wide range of opinions about Ja Rule, some like him and always have, some never have, some hate him for his beef with 50 Cent &amp; Co, some feel like he has not dropped an album worth paying attention to since his debut &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; (1999). Others feel that he sold out by doing R &amp; B collaborations and became the mainstream rapper they hate, whatever the case people know him. For a long time now fans of Ja Rule have been waiting for him to drop a hardcore hip hop album with no R &amp; B collabs, and he has delivered the goods with &quot;Blood In My Eye&quot; (2003), a fourteen track release which is really eight full tracks, two freestyles, one Intro, and three skits. Guest appearances come from Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah, James Gotti, Sizzla, Do Cannon, Big Remo, Black Child, Young Merc, Shadow &amp; Sekou 720. Most of these artists are Murder Inc related, with a few exceptions like Hussein Fatal (a former member of 2Pac's group Outlawz) making the most appearances. I would have to say Ja Rule has probably been the most hated rapper of this year, artists like 50 Cent, Eminem, Busta Rhymes,Obie Trice, DMX, and even Dr. Dre have dissed him over the last year. I enjoy music from all of the above artists, and dont let there beefs change how I feel about there music. This album is essentially a collection of tracks where Ja Rule is dealing with his beefs. Some of this material has been circulating for some time on mixtapes but this is really the introduction of it to mainstream hip hop audiences. All that said I have to say I am enjoying this one, Ja Rule's lyrical content is entertaining to me, production is solid, and I like the heavy beats and some of the guest appearances. After the intro, &quot;The Life&quot; Feat. Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah, &amp; J.Gotti is a decent track, like the piano and heavy drum beat. First real standout for me is the single &quot;Clap Back&quot; a sick track, with a memorable beat, actually first heard this when I saw an uncut version of the video. The follow up track &quot;The Crown&quot; is excellent, lyrically Ja Rule tears into 50 Cent, backed by a pounding piano beat and Sizzla's reggae chorus. Rule widens his scope from 50 Cent to G-Unit, Em and Dre on the powerful diss track &quot;Things Gon Change&quot; feat. Black Child, Young Merc &amp; Do Cannon, Black Child comes across rawest on this one for me. The last real standout is &quot;Race Against Time&quot; (Part 2) which is like the original exceptional, musically this is my favorite track on this album, love the horns, drums, and Rule's singing/rhyming works well. With the exception of the nice collaboration title track &quot;Blood In My Eye&quot; feat. Hussein Fatal, the tracks that follow range from average to skippable for me, more diss tracks with a lower level of quality production. &quot;The Wrap&quot; has been popular on mixtapes, but I have to say I like the &quot;Burn&quot; beat best when Mobb Deep is on it. A short release, &quot;Blood In My Eye&quot; is really more of an EP, I find it an improvement over his last album and recommend it to Ja Rule fans. As for others I would recommend giving it a listen first. One.

Encore second album "Layover" (2004) is a memorable release. This is the first first work I have heard from him, and I find that Encore delivers a unique album definetly worth checking out. Lyrically he is a good MC, who drops grounded intelligent lyrics, backed by some impressive production (Jake One, Vitamin D, Architect). At thirteen tracks (plus 1 skit) this is a short release, with a number of standout tracks. After intro the pumped up title track "Layover" has Encore waking people while talking about the rap game. Next comes "Break Bread", a track with a laidback beat, and a hungry determined Encore. My personal favourites come midaway and later in the album. The first of these is "The Schizm" feat. R & B singer Nathan Thomas , an outstanding track about love and a lady. The beat and concept to "Home" are just ill, Encore delivers a premium talk when talking about his genuine love for his parents and giving thanks. Encore's duet with the tight (hot) sounding Ladybug Mecca on "Real Talk", is just one of those chilled out cuts that makes me think of my woman. The fastpaced "City Livin'" feat. Pep Love is another decent collabration. Encore hooks up again with Nathan Thomas on the excellent "Faithful" an upbeat feel good track, on which Encore drops some addictively nice introspective lyrics. I would not really regard any tracks as weak on this, though a few do fall under skip material for me. Encore does shine on a number of tracks , making "Layover" an album I would recommend getting if your looking for more then the ordinary, and appreciate an MC who can deliver the goods while simply being himself.

After a five year hiatus Terror Squad returns with there second album &quot;True Story&quot;. The group has changed since its last album, tragically losing its most established and in my opinion most talented artist Big Pun (R.I.P.). The other change is two original members Cuban Link and Triple Seis have parted ways and are pursuing solo careers. In Cuban Link's case there is bad blood between him and Fat Joe as most people who follow the group know. The group now consists of four original members Fat Joe, Armageaddon, Prospect, Tony Sunshine and one new addition in female MC Remy Martin.The album opens with Terror Squad leader Fat Joe letting it be known Terror Squad is still holding it down on &quot;Nothings Gonna to Stop Me&quot;, singer Tony Sunshine drops in halfway and in a role reversal, Sunshine rhymes while Fat Joe drops a chorus. Remy Martin who has made a name for herself through winning some battles leads the way on &quot;Yeah Yeah Yeah&quot; and &quot;Hum Drum&quot;. Fat Joe and Remy Martin hook up again for the lead single &quot;Lean Back&quot; which has become a summertime anthem that has been exploding on the radio for weeks, its a catchy track that is bound to help the squad sell units. This track has spun off a number of remixes and has more on the way. Tony Sunshine then tones things down and adds diversity to the album with two laidback R & B tracks &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Streets of NY&quot; feat. Remy Martin. Big Pun is resurrected on &quot;Bring Em Back&quot;. I am not impressed by &quot;Yes Dem to Def&quot; which states Fat Joe as &quot;the true king of New York&quot;, and has Joe rhyming with a poor Jay-Z imitation like flow. Thankfully Armageaddon drops &quot;Pass Away&quot; which is easily my favourite track on this release. Delivering introspective lyrics Geddy brings mad depth on this cut, backed by a sick beat and some smooth Tony Sunshine vocals this is a track to remember. Gotta say Armageaddon is now my favourite TS MC, and I hope to see a solo album out from him in future. The next track is the pounding &quot;Let Them Things Go&quot;, not really feeling it. Prospect gets his chance to shine on &quot;Thunder in the Air&quot; and then &quot;Terror Era&quot; closes things off.Overall this is a decent album, its good to see Terror Squad back at it. The production from the likes of Scram Jones,DJ Khaled, Scott Storch, Streetrunner and Lord Finesse is stellar. On the rhyming side I have to admit I miss Big Pun and Cuban Link, who were my favourite MC's of the group and the ones who stood out the most for me on the first album. No real point in dwelling on past though, Fat Joe has brought his squad back into the game by delivering a short but solid summertime album. Terror Squad fans can expect to see solo albums from Remy Martin and Tony Sunshine. Recommend checking &quot;True Story&quot; out, and if your new to Terror Squad I highly recommend checking out there first album as well.3 1/2

Never bought a Jay-Z album since Reasonable Doubt, got the double album "Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse" as a present this christmas. Executive produced by Jay-Z, Dame Dash, and Kareem Burke. Track production comes from The Neptunes, Kayne West, Guru, Just Blaze, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, No I.D., R. Feemster, Heavy D, Charmalane, Digga. Like the first track "A Dream" Feat. Faith Evans and Notorious B.I.G., has Biggie verses from my all time favourite Biggie Track "Juicy". Next comes "Hovi Baby", the female hook on this track is wack. This is followe by "The Watcher" feat. Dr. Dre, Rakim and Truth Hurts and all I can say is it made me look forward to Rakim's next album "Oh My God". "03 Bonnie & Clyde" is a remake of Pac track, have to say at first I was annoyed with this release, so much Pac biting ("Me and My Girlfriend") , but Jay-Z pays tribute as seen in the video, and Beyonce comes out nice as well. Next comes "Excuse Me Miss" a relaxed track with nice beats. "All Around the World" feat. Latoya Williams, is similar relaxed track where Jay-Z talks to the ladies. A few less than memorable tracks follow then "I did it my Way" comes, a good closer to disc one. Disc Two opens with "Diamond is Forever" a blazing hot track, where Jay spits some nice verses, with phat background beats. "Guns and Roses" feat. Lenny Kravitz brings another feel to the album, never thought I would see these two on the same track, decent track. "U dont Know" (Remix) feat. M.O.P. is a nice banging track from Rocafellas newest additions. Jay-Z drops tragic story on "Meet the Parents". Favourite track is "Some How Some Way" feat. Beanie Sigel and Scarface, sad track, where Jay talks about getting out of the ghetto,losing friends, changing ones ways. "Some People Hate" is a banging track produced by Kayne West where Jay-Z talks about haters and the game. The title track "Blueprint 2" is a memorable one, Jays flow on this one is deadly. Last track "A ballad for the Fallen Soldier" is chilled out track, where Jay-Z talks about life, love this track. The three bonus tracks are alright, though not needed. No "Reasonable Doubt" but a good album, with some real banging tracks, an album you can bump for some time. Recommend it for the collection. 3.5

About six years ago I got Jack Whyte's &quot;The Fort at River's Bend&quot; as a gift along two other books in the Camulod series, recently I decided to reread this one, the fifth book in the series. This was actually the first book I read in the series, and for me it really took me too another place, another age, another time. On rereading this I found that there are some dry areas, where there is far too much description for the average reader, for example maybe somebody with real intrest of swords would like all the description, but pages of description on the same topic can be too much. For those sections I found myself scanning them, till I came to other areas of more intrest. I really like the characters in this book, they really grow on you like Connor Mac Athol, Derek of Ravenglass, Ambrose and of course the main character Caius Meryln Brittanicus who we get to follow intimately in the narrative. We also get to follow a young Arthur, I find this particularly intresting as I think its important to follow characters as they grow, and once you have read the follow up book to this the second in the Sorcerers series &quot;Metamorphsis&quot; there is much more continuity. I Also like the settings of Ravenglass and Mediobogdum, there is something that appeals to me in the idea of a very small community up in the hills in an old roman fortress living in temporary peaceful isolation. I guess some readers also thrive on continous action, and this book has less then others in the series, however I found the limited battle scenes in this book captivating. I have noticed some other reviewers have felt differently about this book, I guess it all depends on how familar you are with the genre and the series, being relatively new to it, I thorougly enjoy it.

Juelz Santana's debut album "From Me to U" (2003) is a late summer banger. I first noticed the Harlem MC on Camron's last joint and thought he came out well on the Diplomats album earlier this year, so I have been looking forward to this release. Juelz is an up and coming rapper and has got that nice fresh vibe to his music some artists get on there first release. I like the fact that Juelz kept his guest appearances limited to his Diplomat family (Camron, Jim Jones Freekey Zeekey)Monique Garnett,Mike Powers, T.I., JR Writer. Some new artists make the mistake of having too many guest appearances with the end result being forgettable albums. Production comes from: Heatmakerz, Charlemagne, Self, Chad Hamilton and Jazz Pha. Album intro is the "Champ is Here" a track to hype listner for whats to come. Gotta say I love "One Day I Smile", which starts with Juelz talking about Aaliyah, Notorious, Pac, Big L, Shyne, Easy-E, JMJ which leads into Juelz taking an introspective look at himself. Juelz comes out blazing on "Okay Okay" & "Back Again", both fastpaced tracks which have Santana repping himself in a braggy way that still comes across as entertaining. On the standout "My Problem" (Jealousy) Juelz apologizes for treating his lady wrong, a rapper that can show regrets is more entertaining and real to this listner then a rapper who thinks showing this side looks bad. Juelz gets deep on the mellow "Why" dropping an autobiographical story. Juelz reps his crew on the powerful "Dipset" (Santana's Town)feat Camron. Not big into "Squalie" feat. JT Writer, the beat to this track sounds too similar to a recent Joe Budden track. Another nice track is "Rain Drops" a laid back track, with a calming R & B chorus, a joint where Juelz talks to and about his family. Juelz and Camron team up well once again on "Let's Go". "This is for My Homies" feat. Jimmy Jones closes off album strong. There are a few tracks I found average and not worth mentioning. Altogether though Juelz Santana delivers a good solid first release with "From Me To You" and shows that he can more then hold his own as a solo artist. Recommend checking this album out if you like following up and coming MC's, if your a diplomats fan (of course), or if you are just looking for something new to bang to.

Snoop Doggy Dogg's solo debut album "Doggystyle" (1993) is without a doubt a Hip Hop classic. A few months from now this cd will officially be ten years old and in my opinion it still has great replay value and remains Snoop's best album. Guest appearances and vocals which are excellent on this release come from: The Dogg Pound (Daz & Kurupt), Nate Dogg, Warren G, The Dramatics, Dr. Dre,D.O.C. RBX Lady of Rage & Nancy Fletcher. Executive produced by Suge Knight, track production which is phenomenal is looked after by Dr. Dre. I like every joint on this thirteen track release, some of favourites include the laidback timeless party/cruise tracks hits "Gin & Juice" , the funkified "Who Am I (What's My Name)?" memorable "Doggy Dogg World" & the getting laid song "Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Can't Have None). Snoop and Company come harder on the street classic "Murder was the Case", deadly 4 way collabo of Snoop, Daz, Kurupt and RBX on "Serial Killa" and the standout piano based "Gz and Hustlas". No doubt that the guest appearances are good, however Snoop really is the star of the show dropping rhymes to remember, with a flow that is truly addictive to listen to. Snoop's "Doggystyle" (as well as Dre. Dre's Chronic)has been like a Blueprint for many West Coast rappers often imitated never duplicated. Another thing that makes this album great is that anyone can enjoy it whether they be a Hip Hop head or someone new to the genre. This is a very good example of original West Coast Hip Hop: full of excellent beats, tight production, memorable lyrics, an album for anyone who loves quality Hip Hop.

Stic.Man (A.K.A. Clayton Gavin) of Dead Prez & Young Noble (A.K.A. Rufus Cooper) of the Outlawz collaboration album is "Soldier 2 Soldier" (2006). While the Outlawz/Dead Prez collaboration album "Can't Sell Dope Forever" got some recognition, this release flew under most people's music radar. Stic.Man to me is one of the Rap games' slept on MC's - a gifted lyricist/singer who has delivered memorable album's as one half of Dead Prez. I have followed Young Noble's music from the multiple Outlawz album's and his appearances on 2Pac's (A.K.A. Makaveli) "The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory" and watched him grow as an artist. The album's introduction is a "Soldier's Prayer AM" - two minutes of substantial words about living life in a productive way - staying true, loyal, keeping one's respect, looking after one's family, staying fit, having beliefs, values and character, overcoming obstacles and being humble. The opening full length track is the single "Runaway Slave" - Stic.Man and Young Noble rhyme back and forth backed by some simple production. The follow up cut is a street banger "Young Black and Just Don't Give A ****", Noble and Stic lace this cut with some raw, grimy lyric's with a guerilla state of mind. Stic.Man & Young Noble remind their audience of the nation's dark past - slavery, corruption, injustice, racism while asking "How U Like That". A short interlude follow's in which Stic.Man talks about the importance of educating the children so they can overcome life's obstacles, which leads into the outstanding "Daddy's Love You" - a track where Stic.Man and Young Noble show their love for their children, giving them advice for the future. Both MC's provide memorable lyrics, while Stic.Man's simple soulful chorus is on point. "Soul Music" is an upbeat feel good track which appreciates the soul classic's of the past, this one vibes well. "Tryin' 2 Make a Livin" is another standout joint, about the struggle to survive. My favourite track on this release at the moment is "Time" - substantial lyrics with a concept that applies to us all - We need to make the most of our lives, because life is short. We have got to appreciate every day like it's our last, because any day it could be. "4 Life" is a track dedicated to that special one of a kind women who is down to ride to the end, once again Stic laces another joint with some soulful vocals - I like how the let one of the album's better beat's run at the end. Stic and Noble then appreciate chronic on "Kali4nya" while stating what it takes to be a soldier on "Like A Soldier Wit It". The album closes with another positive prayer in "Soldier's Prayer PM". The only negative of this album for me is production which is generally sparse, at times lacking and feels unfinished - It would be good to see these two get the production they deserve. Both MC's make up for this by delivering on point lyrics throughout. I would like to see more Dead Prez-Outlaw collaboration projects in the future. Stic.Man & Young Noble provide a quality release, with "Soldier 2 Soldier".

Mobb Deep's fourth album "Murda Muzik" (1999) marked the return of the Mobb three years after there last "Hell on Earth" (1996) four years since the classic "The Infamous" (1995), and seven since they debuted with "Juvenile Hell". Prodigy and Havoc stay consistent once again delivering another memorable album. Guest apperances come from Raekwon, Nas, Lil Kim, Lil Cease, Cormega, Kool G Rap, Eightball, and the Infamous Mobb. Album opens with, "Streets Raised Me" and like Havoc says this is something you feel- laced with a sick beat, memorable verses and good background vocals this is a very nice starting track. On "Spread Love" Mobb promotes love over war. Mobb is in regular form on "Allustrious" a track where they rep themselves and let it be known that they will take on all challengers. Another good track is "Where Ya From" which has the Mobb and Eightball repping from NY to Memphis. "Quiet Storm" is a classic Mobb track, Prodigy and Hav drop ill lyrics to an insanely ill beat. Somber "Where Ya Heart At" is my favourite track on this album, Mobb goes very deep on this one. Infamous Mobb shows potential on "Thug Music" and Mobb comes through strong on the title track. Next two collabration tracks are excellent, "Realest" feat. Kool G Rap & "It's Mine" feat. Nas, both standout cuts. Remix of "Quiet Storm" feat. Lil Kim is ill like the original (though I like original a bit more). There are no tracks I dislike on this though a few early ones I skip over now. "Murda Muzik" is another standout Mobb album, definetly one for the collection. 4.5

More then eight years have passed since Tupac Shakur died, and in that time we have seen many post-death 2Pac releases. Fans of his music hold many different opinions on how his legacy should be handled. Personally I am almost always happy to see revised Tupac material, as long as that material is carefully looked after. From the producers I don't expect miracles; I do however want some quality and diverse beats. Afeni Shakur tried something different by giving Eminem sole production on "Loyal to the Game" (2004). Guest appearances are different then past albums as well as they come from a group of artists who with the exception of the Outlawz, Big Syke and Nate Dogg never collaborated with 2Pac in his lifetime.The album opens with "Soldier Like Me", a thugged out track, which has Pac telling a story of confronting the cops, Eminem appears midway to deliver a chorus. E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz drop in for the solid "Uppercut". The next track "Out on Bail" starts off with Pac saying "drop that s*** Em", an unlikely occurrence as he never knew Eminem, the rest of the lyrics are fine but the beat to this cut is below average. Thankfully things pick up with the albums first outstanding track "Ghetto Gospel", an impressive Elton John chorus helps enhance some very real Pac lyrics. Young Noble, Kastro, and Eminem appear on the lengthy "Black Cotton". The title track "Loyal to the Game" features G-Unit members 50 Cent, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks- how people feel about this track will probably generally be based on how they feel about G-Unit. I like 50's chorus, Buck's lyrics are decent, while Banks are forgettable. Nate Dogg was one of the early R & B singers to collaborate with Pac so "Thugs Get Lonely Too" a track where Pac talks to the ladies has a bit more of an authentic feel to it, I like Nate Dogg's chorus. Jadakiss is a rapper I like, but N.I.G.G.A. (Never Ignorant About Getting Goals Accomplished) suffers from some lackluster production and Jada ends up sounding out of place. Another standout track is the fast paced "Who do You Love?" which has Pac on solo, doing his own chorus backed by a beat that works well. The next track "Crooked Nigga Too" has a youthful less developed sounding Pac flowing at a rapid pace. I am feeling "Don't You Trust Me", the lyrics, production and Dido appearance are all premium and result in a track to remember. The next two tracks are below par to me, I really don't know what Obie Trice is doing on "Hennessy" as he brings nothing to the track; "Thug 4 Life" also falls under skip material. My favorite track is the excellent "Po Nigga Blues" (Scott Scorch), which is laced with some soulful vocals from R & B legend Ron Isley. E.D.I. and Sleepy Brown hook up for the Red Spyda rendition of "Hennessy", I prefer this version to the earlier cut. Same thing goes for the Raphael Saadiq remix of "Crooked Nigga Too" which is far more enjoyable then the earlier version. The album closes off on a good note as DJ Quik and Big Syke bring a different version of "Loyal to the Game" to life.Some people may feel my five star rating is too generous. After all some of the production and guest appearances are lackluster, in my opinion Eminem either seems to hit or miss, and for every miss one may think of what the track could have been like if another producer handled it. More variety in production would of likely have led to a better-produced album. I think a lot Pac fans would have also preferred to see artists Pac actually collabrated with back in the day instead of people he did not know (to me its about whether the guest enhances the track). I don't condone or appreciate the way Eminem changed Pac's vocals to mention himself and G-Unit. On the other hand Eminem seems to generally have a lot of reverence for Pac's music, and this release would not have come about it Afeni Shakur felt otherwise (read the notes). My perspective though is to appreciate what I got instead of focusing on negatives. Pac was one hell of a talented and prolific artist, happy to see that his music continues to be released. Like all reviewers I am biased, and in this case my bias comes from being someone who will take a revised Pac album over 99% of the releases out today. My favorite tracks on this release are "Po Nigga Blues", "Ghetto Gospel", "Uppercut", "Who Do You Love" and "Don't You Trust Me". "Loyal to the Game" is an album I highly recommend for the collection.

J Dilla's "Donuts" (2006) is an impressive creative thirty-one track instrumental album. It's not very often that I review instrumental albums, but I am glad I took the time to check out the last album released in Jay Dee's life. May he Rest In Peace. Every track is unique on this release, and Dilla takes his listening audience through a distinct, soulful, entertaining and memorable musical journey. The third track "Waves" is dope, as is the Jazzy "The New". Backed by a brief Jadakiss sample, and some smooth singing "Stop" is one of my early favourites, love this instrumental. Definitely feeling the upbeat piano based "Mash", and soulful "Time: The Donut of the Heart". On "One Eleven" Dilla elevates his audience to another place all together, production on this cut is off the hook. The second longest track is "Don't Cry", which samples an old school song, I don't think the singer's lines are coincidental, I think Jay Dee was thinking of his loved ones in particular when he made this cut. More impressive tracks follow, those who listened to Ghostface's new album "Fishscale" will be familiar with "One For Ghost". Laidback standouts like "Dilla Says Go" & "U-Love" are excellent. Another favorite of mine is "Bye", a sad memorable sounding track. The "Last Donut Of The Night" and "Donut" (Intro) close this release off well. Reviewer Jerkstore made some interesting insights in regards to the significance behind this album and describing the way Dilla kept battling on making music into his last days. Another major loss for Hip-Hop, J Dilla will not be forgotten.

The latest 2Pac release &quot;Resurrection&quot; (Soundtrack) is another memorable post death joint. Executive produced by Afeni Shakur this runs in at fourteen tracks. The three revised unreleased tracks were the highlight of this soundtrack for me. Like most people the first of these that I heard was &quot;Runnin' (Dying To Live)&quot; feat. Notorious B.I.G., I like Emimem's production and the Edgar Winter sample to this track, adding Biggie and Pac voice samples really gave it a sense of realness and this one track got me hooked. Another of the unreleased tracks is &quot;Ghost&quot; the album opener, with Pac coming across thugged out, backed by another nice beat. &quot;One Day At A Time&quot; feat. Outlawz and Eminem is decent, its good to see Pac's boys still riding for him. 50 Cent's appearance on &quot;Realist Killaz&quot; did not do much for me, though its not a bad collabration and provides something different. Having followed Tupac since back in the day I have the other nine tracks on past releases. I like all of these tracks, my favs though are &quot;Rebel of the Underground&quot; from his debut album, &quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot; from his 2nd album, and &quot;Bury Me A G&quot; from group album &quot;Thug Life: Volume 1&quot; . I am happy that they included some of his older material, some classic cuts that some people have yet to hear. Looking forward to seeing the movie in a few days, recommend checking out the soundtrack.

Styles (Holliday Styles, Styles P) Gangster and A Gentleman, is the summer album of 2002, and is bound to be one of the best releases of the year. Styles a member of the trio the Lox, follows Jadas solo Album "Kiss the game Goodbye" with one of his own. The tracks that stand out the most for me off this album are "Good Times" which talks about getting high, "Black Magic" feat Angie Stone, "My brother" which is a dedication for Style's fallen brother and probably the deepest track on the album. However my favourite track, is actually a bonus track called "The Life", Styles and Pharoahe Monch collab in what has to be one of nicest collabs in long time, both artists shining. The album does have some more gems, and also has a few tracks that are less than memorable. However on the whole, the album has good production and ill beats, and Styles shines while Solo. What I also like about this album, is unlike Jada, Styles keeps his guest list short, and on no track does he get outshined. Having followed the Lox from "Money, Power and Respect", to their ruff ryder albums, I have to say I enjoy their albums more when they come out solo, so far they are 2/2 in my books in this department. To sum up, Style's "Gangster and a Gentleman" is straight blazing, an album to enjoy.

The Fugees (Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Pras) sophomore album "The Score" (1996) is a first class album and deserves all the recognition it has recieved. Musically and lyrically the Fugees dropped a gem with this release, delivering an album to remember. What I appreciate most about this album is the variety of musical influences the Fugees use in there music whether it be Hip Hop, Soul, Reggae, Gospel or Blues. The Fugees do justice to the originals on there covers for "Killing Me Softly With His Song" (Roberta Flack) and "No Woman, No Cry" (Bob Marley), both of these songs are off the hook. I wont front either, I had never heard the original versions back in 96, but have since listened to and enjoyed them and become a Bob Marley fan, thanks to this album. Love the instrumentals, Fugees rhyming and Lauryn Hill's outstanding vocals on "Ready or Not" and "Fu-Gee-La". The Fugees rip "Zealots" warning other MCs not to mess around, and talk about police discrimination on "The Beast". The darkly deep "Family Business" with Omega and Forte is another sick track. Both the "Fu-Gee-La" mixes are good, I especially like the "Refugee Camp Remix". Individually and collectively the Fugees shine on the "The Score" an album for every Hip Hop collection.

Mobb Deep return with their sixth album "Amerikaz Nightmare" (2004). Having followed the duo of Prodigy and Havoc for over ten years I have to say I am really happy to see another release from them. It has been three years since they have released a full-length group album (not including Murda Mixtape) and they are now with a new label Jive Records. I am still bumping their previous albums on a regular basis, and consider "The Infamous" & "Hell on Earth" to be Classic albums. Mobb Deep has always excelled at delivering reality street Rap and continue to do so with this long awaited release.The albums opener, which shares its name, has a hungry Mobb Deep providing a grimy track showing that they're still holding their spot down. Mobb Deep then deliver an excellent track with "Win or Lose", feeling the lyrics and background chorus to this cut. Havoc leads the way on the hardcore "Flood the Block". The first guest appearance comes from Nate Dogg on "Dump Dump", feeling this collaboration. By now most people have heard the hit single "Got It Twisted" which has been getting a lot of play in the clubs and surprisingly the radio. I find that I am not feeling a lot of lead singles these days because artists change their formats to get that commercial appeal, Mobb Deep does not do that at all on this joint and end up providing an outstanding track. Long time Mobb beat provider Alchemist laces "When you Hear the" with a sick beat which P and Hav kill. Mobb then breaks things down on thugged out tracks "Real N***az" and "Shorty Wop". Not a Lil' Jon fan and not feeling his trademark yeah's which are featured on "Real Gangstaz". Jadakiss on the other hand is an MC I appreciate so it's nice to see him on "One of Ours Part II". Not to forget it was Havoc who provided the addictive beat for Jada's hit lead single. Mobb come hard with "On the Run" and follow it up with the banging "Throw Your Hands" (In the Air), which is my favourite track on this album. Kayne West provides an insane beat for this cut, Prodigy shines lyrically while Havoc provides a memorable chorus. Fellow QB MC's Littles and Noyd hook up with Mobb on the decent "Get Me". Mobb Deep then supply two more impressive tracks with the dangerous "We Up" and sick "Neva Change". Twista has finally gotten the credit he deserves this year so its good to see him hook with P and Hav on the remix of "Got it Twisted".Nothing can surpass the original Mobb Deep albums for me, all the same this one easily gets five stars as it's a complete album with a number of outstanding tracks. Mobb follow their winning formula and provide the hardcore tracks Rap fans have come to love them for. Although both Mobb Deep MC's impress on this release, I really feel Havoc shines, and I hope he follows this up with the solo album many of us have been waiting for. Mobb Deep has succeeded in creating a first class album with "Amerikaz Nightmare". This is easily one of my favourite releases of the year and I highly recommend checking it out.

Jin's (Jin Au-Yeung) debut album is "The Rest is History" (2004). Up until recently I have followed Jin's music from a distance, watched him win a number of freestyle contests and establish himself as an up and coming rapper. Being the first Asian MC to get major mainstream attention must have its ups and downs, Ruff Ryder's Jin has proven he deserves that chance to shine. After the introduction, Jin shows some hunger on the standout "Here Now", rhyming and delivering his own chorus. Fastpaced Swizz Beatz produced "Get Ur Handz Off" follows, a decent cut. Next couple tracks fall under skip material for me, then Jin hooks up with Kayne West on "I Got a Love", a track that flows smoothly. Jin reps his roots on "Learn Chinese" with Wyclef. Another single off this album is "Senorita", a dance track where Jin talks to the ladies, not feeling it. Jin shines on "Love Story", delivering a genuine track about his own love story, while Aja Smith provides some soulful vocals. On "Cold Outside" feat. Lyfe , Jin opens up, and gets instrospective talking about who he really is. The albums last real standout track for me is "Same Cry", a track where Jin goes deep talking about Tiananmen square, SARs, and how the Chinese only allow one child per family, while L.T provides a memorable chorus. I like it when Jin talks about relevant issues. I do not like the overly pop club friendly tracks though. Sure, they may help an album sell, but really have no long term value. "The Rest is History" is a decent debut album, with a couple of standout tracks.

D'Angelo (A.K.A. Michael D'Angelo Eugene Archer) sophomore album was "Voodoo" (2000) a thirteen track release from the talented Neo Soul singer. The lead single and my favourite track on this release was the DJ Premier produced "Devil's Pie", I first heard this track when watching the Hip Hop movie "Belly". This is one of those track's that sticks with you and has great replay value. D'Angelo's attention winning single for this release was the outstanding love ballad "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", which was written by Raphael Saadiq, featured an effective video for the ladies, and made in tribute of singer Prince. Method Man & Redman were enlisted for another single in the lukewarm "Left & Right", while the fourth and final single was a feel good sleeper track called "Send It On". Elsewhere D'Angelo sings about sticking to his guns and putting it all on "The Line", reflects on missing a past love on "One Mo'Gin", while looking to get free on "Spanish Joint". Laidback lengthy tracks like "Playa Playa" & "Greatdayindamornin'/Booty" worked well, and D'Angelo sat back at times letting the instrumentals do the work. On the album's closer "Africa" D'Angelo uses minimal vocals, acknowledging his homeland. Overall "Voodoo" was a very solid release which is worth adding to the collection. New fan's should check out his classic debut album "Brown Sugar". It's been over seven years now since D'Angelo dropped an album, he is now a father of two. His most recent appearances have been on Common's new album "Finding Forever" on a track called "So Far To Go" (remake of J Dilla cut) & a collaboration with Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre for a tight joint called "Imagine" which appeared on Snoop's "Tha Blue Carpet Treatment". D'Angelo is currently working on his third release tentatively titled "James River".

Scarface's (B.Jordan) seventh album "The Fix" is one of the nicest to come out in 2002. Thirteen tracks with guest appearances from: Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, Kelly Price, Nas, Faith Evans,R.Flack, D. Hathaway and W.C. Executive produced by B.Jordan and J. Prince. Track production comes from M. Dean,C.Black, Kayne West, N. Myrick, Nottz,T.Mix,T.Pizzaro,Flip and the Neptunes. Album starts with track called "Safe" which uses nice piano instrumental , short track and good intro to the album. Scarface collabrates with Jay-Z and Beanie Siegel on "Guess who Back" produced by Kayne West one of this years hottest producers, the track is nice, and Scarface and Jay-Z flow well toghther. "On My Block" is the lead single on "The Fix" and its good one and has great replay value. "What Can I Do" feat. Kelly Price is a powerfull track, and face drops deep and memorable verses. "In between us" feat. Nas follows and is another nice collabration. Neptunes one production contribution to this album is track called "Someday" feat. Faith Evans and its a good one. Scarface talks about life and death on "Heaven" feat. Kelly Price, and this continues Faces run of nice Rap/R&B collabration. W.C. drops in for the album closer "I aint the one" a nice banging track. Scarface has lived alot of the stories he tells, so he comes across real, rugged and memorable. Southern Rap at its best, an album definetly worth getting. 4.5

&quot;You got me&quot; is one of those tracks that really stands out, very powerfully. The Roots and Erykah Badu drop a memorable rap/r&amp;b collabo. Black Thought is on the mic on this one, and drops some very memorable verses. Really this is a love song, somewhat sad, and very moving. Also recommend watching the video for it, where Black Thought is walking down streets, full of people that are out (dead/sleeping?) and near the end he settles down besides his woman played by Eve. This single can be found on the Roots album &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;. This track also helped give The Roots some more mainstream appeal, which is good to see, as the Roots in my opinion are one of the nicest, most original rap groups out there.

Outkast's (Andre Benjamin &amp; Big Boi) 2nd album &quot;Atliens&quot; (1996) is in my opinion a Hip Hop classic. This is a fifteen track release, which is executive produced by A. Reid, K. Edmonds &amp; Organized Productions. This album is amazing in that Outkast goes real deep, gets real innovative and really takes there listners to another world with addictive insightful lyricism, memorable beats which are enhanced by excellent background vocals from the likes of: D. Killings, EJ tha Witch Doctor,Joe,Whild Peach,Trina,Dawn,Tracy,Arylnn, Sleepy Brown, A. Martin, Cee-Lo Green, Khujo, T-Bu, Cool Breeze, Big Gipp, Tamara &amp; S. Edgill. Never seen a Hip Hop album cover/insert like this one, very unique like Outkast's music. Album opens with the calming &quot;You May Die&quot; ( Intro), which is followed up the less than calm &quot;Two Dope Boys&quot; (In a Cadillac ), which has the dynamic duo talking about wack rappers, rides and more. This is followed up by the albums title track a wicked track, with an addictive chorus from Andre. Guitar backed &quot;Wheelz of Steel&quot; is about learning life's lessons, child birth, and Aids. &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot; is laced with some very nice background female vocals, and has Outkast talking about the ladies, its really about the downfall *some* woman go through. Next comes the albums lead single &quot;Elevators&quot; (Me &amp; You) a track where Outkast reminiscence about growing up, getting blunted and making it in the rap game. &quot;Babylon&quot; is another memorable track. The albums shortest track is &quot;Wailin&quot; and I recently realized where Prodigy got the beat for one of his tracks on his album H.N.I.C., needless to say its a ill beat. Outkast gets deeper on the &quot;Mainstream&quot; feat. Goodie Mob, and mention how they strive to be innovative on &quot;Millenium&quot;. Andre and Big Boi each drop excellent verses on &quot;E.T.&quot; (Extraterrestrial). Big Rube does the intro on &quot;13th Floor/Growing Old&quot; a very deep sad sounding track, where Outkast take there listners to new heights and Debra Killings drops a beautiful chorus. The ONIP BG Mix of &quot;Elevators&quot; finishes the album off. Outkast have never disappointed me, &quot;Atliens&quot; is a gem to enjoy, an album with a very memorable vibe from start to finish, a release for any Hip Hop collection.

It has been almost ten years since Outkast dropped there debut album &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; (1994). Since then Andre and Big Boi have delivered another five great albums and are widely respected by many as the most consistent Rap duo of all time. Simply put there ability to diversify, experimentand deliver original music time after time make them great. Organized Noize production is tight on this release. Outkast make there introduction on &quot;Myintrotoletuknow&quot;, and rep there hometown on &quot;Ain't No Thang&quot;. The title track &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; is a laid back cut to groove to. The highlight of this album for me is without a doubt &quot;Player's Ball&quot; an amazing single, one of those excellent tracks with a never ending amount of replay value. Another of my favourites is the deep &quot;Claimin True&quot;, a track about the streets, making money and paying dues. Outkast bring some melody with the love track &quot;Funky Ride&quot;. They then collabrate with Goodie Mob and deliver &quot;Git Up, Git Out&quot;, a first class track full of meaningful, introspective and positive lyrics. Pimped out &quot;Crumblin' Erb&quot; and &quot;Hootie Hoo&quot; keep things going nicely and the short &quot;Player's Ball&quot; (Reprise) closes off the album on a high note. Like all there albums &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; is one for the collection.

The Ruff Ryders return with "Redemption, Vol 4" (2005). The years have gone by, and the crew has had its ups and downs but remains strong. The Lox, who have all dropped solid solo albums in recent years, start the album off strong backed by a banging beat on "Ruff Ryders 4 Life". The next track "If It's Beef" has Jadakiss collabing with some of the Ruff Ryders up and comers Flashy, Infa.Red and Kartoon. Drag-On & Choclate Ty deliver another banger with "Knock Knock". Cross, Styles and Infared team up with reggae artists Snypah & Bunny Wailer for "Ghetto Children". Noreaga & Pirate bring "Dame Reggaeton", then Scarlett, Kartoon and Aja provide the laidback "What Ryders Do". Flashy drops some very real lyrics on "Stay Down" while Akon provides a heartfelt chorus. My favourite banger on this release is easily "Get Wild", DMX, Jada, Kartoon and Flashy rip up this cut. It's good to see X at it, looking forward to his upcoming sixth album. "Aim For the Head" has Cassidy, J-Hood and Jin collabing, I prefer the original unreleased version with Game. Jada hooks up with Flashy, Infa.Red and Flashy again for the thugged out "Keep the Gunz Cocked (If It's Beef... Remix). Two more average tracks follow then female singer LT closes off the album with "So Serious", my first impression when I heard this one was this track seems out of place, don't mind it though. What you notice listening to this is that this release is more a display of Ruff Ryders new artists then it is of its established ones. Eve's presence is missed, DMX makes one appearance (guess he is saving it for the album), while the Lox appear on a couple of tracks. This new generation of Ruff Ryders has some potential but will have to do more if they want to become recognized in a flooded Hip-Hop scene. Overall "Redemption, Vol 4" is a decent release which I recommend to Ruff Ryder fans. If your like me though you will be looking out for DMX's next album "Here We Go Again".

Group Home's (Melachi Da Nutcracker and Lil Dap) debut album "Livin' Proof" (1995) was an impressive first release. Produced by one of my hip hops most established producers DJ Premier of Gang Starr for MCs that appeared on his projects(Melachi and Dap appear on Daily Operation, Hard to Earn) this album is laced with excellent first class beats to remember. While Melachi and Lil Dap are not great MC's I feel that they hold there own on there first release, though I do agree lyrical content is limited. Singles "Suspended in Time" and "Supa Star" are two of my favourite tracks on the album, I like the later where Group Home goes deep while talking about the streets and giving shoutouts at the end of the track. The title track "Livin Proof" has an insane beat as does the grimey sounding "4 Give My Sins". "Baby Pa" picks up midway and Group Home is smart enough to let the beat do the work. Backed by a dope piano beat, Melachi and Lil Dap's simple rhymes work well on "2 Thousand", 95 is yours 2000 is mine. "Up Against Tha Wall" and "The Realness" close off the album strong. Some people may get bored of the repetitive use of lines like "such a pity that livin in the city is like livin in the times of Frank Nitti", for some reason this appeals to me, both MC's have distinct flows which blend well with Premos beats. "Livin' Proof" is an album I would recommend checking out, a unique and memorable release.

Jay-Z's first album "Reasonable Doubt" (1996) is a hiphop Classic and is his best album to date. What makes this album great is the rawness Jay-Z had then, coming out powerfully in this debut. This is the cat that went from selling cds out of the back of his car, to hiphops most well known name today. Production comes from Ski, Clark Kent, DJ Premier, among others. Album opens with "Cant Knock the Hustle" feat. Mary J Blige, Jay spits sick lyrics on this one, and Mary J does not dissapoint on the hook. This is followed by "Politics as Usual" where Jay talks about street life. The Late Great Notorious B.I.G. drops in for "Brooklyn's Finest", and Jay and Biggie drop an amazing track. Next comes "Dead Presidents II" a more relaxed track, where Jay talks about where he wants to go, where hes come from, to this sick sad background beat. "Feelin' It" is a track about living the good life. Chilled out DJ premier produced "D'Evils" is a track about the danger of money power and fame. "Can I Live" which samples Isaac Hayes flows smoothly. "Aint No N****" feat Foxy Brown is more of a filler track, kind of funny too though. "Coming of Age" Feat. Memphis Bleek, in his debut with Rocafella, track is about coming up in the game. Premier produced "Bring It on" feat. Big Jaz and Sauce Money, is yet another nice track. Album closes off with "Regrets" a song with a tragic yet very real story about survival, a very memorable and powerfull track. Long before Jay-Z went commerical and became a household name, there was "Reasonable Doubt" a hiphop classic, a banging album from start to finish, recommend this for anyone that loves hiphop at its best.

Ja Rules &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; was his first album, and so far his best. On this one Ja Rule comes drops some of the deepest,darkest, illest hiphop in years, non commerical for the street hiphop. Anybody that thinks Ja is simply a rapper who does R &amp; B collabrations needs to check this album. &quot;Worlds Most Dangerous&quot; is a hardcore track which uses a fat baseline, and thick drum beats, and is a strong start to the album. The next track &quot;Lets Ride&quot; is ill and grimy, and Ja shows his hunger for the game. &quot;Holla Holla&quot; and &quot;Kill Em All&quot; follow, and are laced with ill beats, followed through by Jas distinct gruff sound. &quot;Suicide freestyle&quot; has Ja repping ... throw the 9 and Blaze my niggas to an addictive beat. &quot;Story to Tell&quot; continues the hardcore theme set all throughout the album, as Ja talks about coming up, and dealing with your enemies. &quot;E-Dub and Ja&quot; is a nice collabration track. Next track &quot;Murda Life&quot; feat. Memphis Bleek is a high tempo adrenaline laced track. &quot;Daddy's Little Baby&quot; feat Ronald Isley shows a sofer side of Ja, that we see more on future albums, soft or not its deep and memorable. &quot;Race Against Time&quot; and &quot;Only Begotten Son&quot; finish off the album, both tracks are examples of hardcore hiphop at its best. &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; is that hardcore hiphop album that people sleep on.Those who have it though, have a gem, and in my opinion one of the best hiphop albums in many years. &quot;Venni Vetti Vecci&quot; is deep,dark,powerfull and was not made for the commerical audience and thats what makes it so dam good.

Avril Lavigne's first album &quot;Let Go&quot; is nice. This is *really* not my typical kind of music to listen to, but after hearing some of her songs on radio, I decided I should try listening to something different, and was suitably impressed. So why write a review when 1400+ other people already have, just to show my appreciatioin of a good work (Best Album of Year- Junos). Not a punk album, somewhat of a pop album, but not the typical pop bs. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; starts off the album powerfully. Lead and hit single &quot;Complicated&quot; follows, and though the song has been killed on radio its good, positive upbeat track, the first time I heard it, knew I was listening to something different. Next come two more songs that have been made into videos &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; and &quot;Im With You&quot;. First songs alright can see the appeal it has for some, the second however, &quot;Im With You&quot; is my favourite song on the album, standout song, about being alone, and reaching out, song really is related to the feeling many young (and all) people feel, trying to make it on there own, Avrils vocal tones on this are amazing, love the way she expands and lowers tones. &quot;Tommorow&quot; is a kind of sad slow song which has main message of tommorow is another day, kind of gives hope that the future can be bright, to keep your head up.&quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot; is a introspective song, which makes you feel different emotions from sad to happy, but is essentially upbeat. &quot;My World&quot; is about Avrils life, growing up in a small town and wanting to get away. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is a song about being real with one's self and not giving into others pressure.Albums closing track is &quot;Naked&quot; a slow melodic song. &quot;Let Go&quot; is a memorable album from a talented young artist.

Kayne West returns with his second solo album "Late Registration" (2005). To say Kayne West has made an impact on the music and entertainment world is an understatement, simply read the latest copy of Time magazine and you will see what I mean. Kayne West's production skills are definitely on point as beats throughout this album are excellent. The albums single's "Gold Digger" feat. Jamie Foxx and "Diamonds From Sierra Leone" are both distinct tracks, I prefer the later. My favorite collaboration on this album is the first track "Heard Em Say", Kayne West and Maroon 5's Adam Levine team up for a memorable cut. Some production help comes from Just Blaze who sampled Curtis Mayfield "Move On Up" for "Touch The Sky" an uplifting track, which has West and Lupe Fiasco shining. The next couple of tracks are good, though in all honesty I find myself listening to the beats/samples more the lyrics. The Hank Crawford sample used on "Drive Slow" reminds me of the one used on a track off 2Pac's All Eyes on Me. Kayne West helped Game out on "Dreams" so it makes sense that he return the favor on "Crack Music". Brandy laces "Bring Me Down" with some smooth vocals, while Kayne West talks about the haters. The remix of "Diamonds From Sierra Leonne" feat. Jay-Z follows. Hov's former rival Nas drops in and provides some substance on "We Major". Kayne West praises and shows his love for his mom on the dedication "Hey Mama". Consquence and Cam'Ron hook up with Kayne for "Gone" another standout, which samples Otis Redding's "It's To Late". Production wise this album is impressive, West samples and innovates well. Lyrically I find Kayne West to be hit or miss, shining on some tracks while barely leaving an impression on others. That said he remains the same rapper, and I respect him for not trying to take on another persona as some do. I recommend picking up "Late Registration" its an album that vibes well, one which fans of many different musical genres will enjoy.

Gang Starr's third album &quot;Daily Operation&quot; (1992) is a memorable release. I got into Gang Starr late, starting with &quot;Moment of Truth&quot;, which to this day remains my favourite album of there's. DJ Premier and Guru are an excellent duo. At more then a decade old this is a first class oldschool Rap album. Throughout this one Guru's lyrics are on point and make you think, while Premo's beats were before there time and ill. Some of my favourite tracks on this one include:&quot;Soliloquy Of Chaos&quot;- Love the beat to this cut, a track where Guru talks about going out with the Crew.&quot;Take It Personal&quot;- Was watching the video to this track other day, Guru drops some Grimey lyrics, talks about the Rap Game, fake MC's and haters, backed by anothers stellar beat.&quot;No Shame in My Game&quot;- Gang Starr has always kept there music real, basically this ones about Guru repping that, and talking to those who don't.&quot;Conspiracy&quot;- This track just goes deep, Guru talks about alot of things including racism towards blacks, genocide and widescale corruption.&quot;The Illest Brother&quot;- Guru talks about streetlife, death, and lets it be known he will take on all contenders.&quot;Take Two And Pass&quot;- just a ill track about getting blunted, which is backed by a chilled out beat.&quot;Daily Operation&quot; is an album I would recommend for the collection for Gang Starr fans, and those who enjoy quality oldschool Rap. Another thing I enjoy about listening to there music is watching there development, listening to Guru's substantial lyrics, and Premo's trademark beats its nice to see that they are one of those rare groups who evolved there styles and never got played out over what has been an excellent fifteen plus year career. And it is not over yet.

Its rare that I find need to review a single as alot of the great ones can be found on albums. However "Flowers for the Dead" is one of the nicest tribute songs ever to come out. Felix Delgado aka Cuban Link drops his realest track ever for his best friend Christopher Rios aka Big Punisher who was also his half-brother from another mother. The track is actually the lead single for Cubans album 24k which never made it onto the market because of record company problems. Cuban describes watching his friend dying, praying and being unable to help him, while flashing back to their past. Then Pun is dead, and Cuban describes how he keeps on hearing his brothers voice. Remembering how talented his friend was, and how Pun was always there to look out for him and how he would make sure Puns wife and kids would be taken care of. All throughout the song, chorus of flowers for the dead is sung, Domingo provides additional vocals for the track. With this single, Cuban expresses his feelings of losing a brother, on behalf of the entire Terror Squad Family. Cuban and Pun were best friends, so it was only natural that when Pun died Cuban unleashed his pain on the mic, letting the world know just how much his brother will be missed. Tracks like this are what make hiphop great. Hopefully the world will wake up soon, and realize that Cuban Link is a worthy successor of his lost friend. Since Puns death, Cuban has left the Terror Squad (not by his own choice) and is currently looking for a record company to produce his next album. Two important things to say, first is R.I.P. Big Pun, second is dont sleep on Cuban Link he is a very talented artist, who just needs the right promotion.

G-Unit member Tony Yayo delivers his first solo effort with "Thoughts of a Predicate Felon" (2005). In almost every rap group there is a weak link, in my opinion Yayo is G-Unit's. He lacks 50's charisma, Buck's flow and Bank's punchlines. He tries to make up for it some by embracing the role of the group's black sheep. After the intro Yayo opens the album up with a thugged out story on "Homicide". Two forgettable tracks pass by then 50 Cent drops in for the album's first single "So Seductive" a decent collaboration. Two solid cuts laced with banging beats follow on "Eastside, Westside" and "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem & Obie Trice. 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks and Olivia drop in for the collabo cut "We Don't Give a F***". A bunch of hurting commercial cuts follow, these are really half assed efforts, Yayo hooking up with the likes of Jagged Edge and Joe has zero appeal for this reviewer. Yayo delivers a semi-decent thugged out cut with "G-****". Maybe "I Know You Don't Love Me" and "Dear Suzie" are supposed to be amusing, but I honestly don't give a flying f*** about G-Unit talking about their groupies and other artists. Yayo closes off the album with one of his better tracks "Live By The Gun". Two things helped this album from being a complete write off, some impressive production and some stellar appearances from Yayo's Aftermath family- sadly every guest artist outshined Yayo. Yayo and Jim Jones are similar to be me; both lack the flow, lyrics, delivery and charisma needed to entertain an audience for a whole album. While I like G-Unit, I do not recommend picking up "Thoughts of A Predicate Felon".

Singer & Songwriter Ne-Yo (A.K.A. Shaffer Chimere Smith) sophomore album "Because of You" (2007) hit stores last month. Guest appearances on this twelve track release come from Jay-Z & singer Jennifer Hudson (Of American Idol Fame). The lead single is the Stargate produced title track "Because of You", which features a crooning Ne-Yo telling a story of being with two women at the same time and loving sex. This track has numerous remixes (not on the album), the most well known ones featuring appearances from Rappers Joe Budden, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Kayne West (official Remix). It's a catchy upbeat tune, which generally vibes real well. The album's first guest appearance comes from Jay-Z on "Crazy", not feeling this cut, Ne-Yo sounds like Michael Jackson, while Def Jam President Jay-Z short verse does not do much for the track. A happy sounding Ne-Yo sings to his woman paying tribute to her, on the laidback "Can We Chill". The album's second single "Do You" follows, and is made in the same format as "So Sick" which was on his debut album "In My Own Words", Ne-Yo sings to his former love. Ne-Yo's crooning about his sex life on "Addicted" results in a lackadaisical track. Singer Jennifer Hudson drops in for the duet "Leaving Tonight", a slow ballad - in which Ms. Hudson shines providing some outstanding vocals. The next two fast paced contributions from Ne-Yo fall under skip material for me. Ne-Yo deliver some soulful vocals for a stellar track in "Angel" which leads up to "Make It Work". The later track is another of my favorites on this release, an introspective Ne-Yo delivers some on point and realistic vocals for this joint. Ne-Yo looks to fufill his woman's deepest desires on the creative "Say It". Norwegian production duo Stargate reunite with Ne-Yo for another track on the album's closer "Go On Girl" - a tale of being played by a bad girl and learning from it. For me "Because of You" has it's high's and low's but is generally a solid release. I think that Ne-Yo avoided the sophomore slump, at the same time I know he can elevate his game more. At twenty-five years old he has lots of time to do that. Recommend this release to long-time fans and newcomers alike, feel good music.

8 Mile Soundtrack, has to be one of the nicest soundtracks out in a long time. In the movie Eminem is the the main actor, and the story is similar to his life story, and his long rise in the game. The soundtrack is laced with loads of rap talent, old and new, with Ems group D12, 50 Cent, Nas, Jay-Z, Young Zee,Gangstarr, Freeway, Macy Gracy, Boomkat, Obie Trice and the legendary Rakim all making appearances. The album opens with the lead single "Lose Yourself", Eminem verses.. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow; this opportunity comes once in a lifetime.. to the background guitar riffs which gradually rise throghout the song. Eminem is passing the message, when the opportunity comes, you better dam will grasp it, track is very powerfull. This is my favourite track on the album."8 Mile" and "Love Me" Feat. 50 Cent and Obie Trice follow and are nice tracks. On "8 Miles and Running" Jay-Z and Freeway drop a deadly combination. Macy Gracys "Time of Your Life" brings about a change in sound, produced by Dante Ross, as does Nas "U wanna be Me" another blazing track where Nas kicks insightful knowledge. Hiphop Legend Rakim who is making a commeback appears on "R.A.K.I.M" and flows nicely, letting you know he is still very much in the game. Gangstarr appears on "Battle" produced by DJ premier. 8 mile soundtrack is really a show of Shady Records talent and Eminems beats but succesfull tracks by big names like Nas, Jay-Z and Rakim all raise the quality of the album. Blazing soundtrack, worth checking out.

Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth's &quot;Mecca &amp; The Soul Brother&quot; (1992) is an excellent album. I have always found that this duo was ahead of there time, and on there first full length release they delivered with an album full of memorable tracks, great beats and impressive lyrical content. First track &quot;Return of the Mecca&quot; has C.L. kicking some knowledge backed by some impressive beats. Next two tracks are nice and lead up to the the relaxed oldschool sounding love song &quot;Lots of Lovin&quot; which is followed up &quot;Act Like You Know&quot; which has C.L. talking about the ladies. The instrumentals (like drums and horns) enhance &quot;Straighten It Out&quot; a track that flows smoothly from start to finish. My favourite track on this one is &quot;They Reminisce over You&quot; (T.R.O.Y.), just love the horns and C.L.'s flow and lyrics on this one. On tracks like &quot;On &amp; On&quot; the duo basically just let the beat do the work and since the beat is great, it works. Another standout out for me &quot;Can't Front On Me&quot; a track where the duo come a bit harder backed by a pounding beat to remember. My only regret about this album is that I did not get it sooner, listening to it back in 92 must of been pure pleasure. Highly recommend &quot;Mecca &amp; The Soul Brother&quot; as an album for the collection.

Dead Prez (Stic.man, M-1) & the Outlawz (E.D.I., Young Noble, Kastro) deliver a short mix tape with "Can't Sell Dope Forever". Being a fan of both groups I have been anticipating this one. Outlawz affiliate (sometimes credited as a member) Stormey makes a number of on point performances on this release. The Outlawz, Dead Prez and Stormey get things started on a strong note with "1 Nation" and the title track "Can't Sell Dope Forever" - both cuts have the team looking for better ways while kicking street knowledge. One of the things I like about Stic.man, is he is a gifted lyricist who can sing to, and remains very much in touch with the streets. Stic.man tells a sad and powerful story of drug addiction on "Like A Window". The Lawz, Dead Prez and Stormey take their audience through the daily grind on "Thuggin' on the Blokkk" and then M-1 & Messy Marv collaborate over a laidback beat on the solid "U Aint The Only 1". Stormey, Scott Lo & Erica shine on "Searchin", outstanding lyrics and a smooth chorus from Erica make this cut a track with replay. Tha Outlawz, Stormey and Malachi provide another standout with "Fork In The Road", 2Pac's vocals are sampled very briefly at the beginning of the track, and the Lawz & Co do him proud on this cut delivering introspective lyrics. Stic.man & Ms. Nora (Stic's Mama) then drop "Believe" which is a follow up lyrically to "Like A Window". Young Noble, Layzie Bone and Stic.man drop some tight verses on the album's closer "Came Up". Dead Prez & Tha Outlawz provide a quality release with "Can't Sell Dope Forever", I will look forward to seeing these two groups collaborate again.

Mobb Deep's seventh album is "Blood Money" (2006). The duo of Prodigy and Havoc have released some excellent albums over the years, my own favorites being "The Infamous" & "Hell on Earth". This is also Mobb Deep's first release since they signed with 50 Cent and aligned themselves with G-Unit. I think this disturbed a lot of old time fans- and maybe with good reason. My opinion has always been it doesn't really matter where Mobb Deep is at as long as they are making quality music. Guest appearances on this release come from G-Unit's: Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, with Mary J Blige and Nate Dogg also providing contributions. After the intro Mobb Deep get things going with the single "Put Em In There Place", it's a decent track but the beat and hook are the type that I find to get repetitive real quickly. "Stole Something" and "Creep" fall under skip material for me, Lloyd Banks is especially bland on the first cut, both tracks have all parties sounding sluggish. Mobb Deep step things up a little bit for the ominous "Speakin So Freely". "Backstage Pass" is hurting, why would anyone care to hear about Mobb Deep talking to their groupies. Young Buck and Tony Yayo do little to elevate the next two cuts. The hardest hitting track on this release for me is "Pearly Gates", 50 Cent laces this cut with an impressive chorus, while Havoc lays down the first two verses and Prodigy finishes it with his own anti religious thoughts (which may piss some people off). "Daydreaming" is a sort of rags to riches joint where Mobb relish the fact they have made it, the next tracks are really the same format in that they are about getting paid. "It's Alright" has the makings of a commercial single, Mary J Blige and 50 Cent drop in on this cut, I have never really been a fan of Mobb Deep love related cuts don't feel its a genre that works for them. "Have A Party" was used on the Get Rich or Die Trying Soundtrack, not a track I like at all. The "Outta Control" (Remix) was the first 50 Cent/Mobb Deep collaborations I heard, it is a feel good track and my favorite on this release. Standouts for on this release include the remix closer and "Pearly Gates", I am not impressed by the majority of G-Unit contributions found throughout this release although 50 does help out on the standouts. Maybe a new generation who never listened to the early classic Mobb albums can pick this one up, and love it. And their will be some long time fans who will feel the same way. Personally to me, Mobb Deep seem watered down, and simply tired lyrically for the most part. That raw street hunger that I loved about them has now been replaced with the: we are getting paid, and own this etc. I am happy to see Mobb Deep is making money but I don't need to hear about it for a whole album. I heard that the Mobb will be helping produce Sam Scarfo's debut album I am looking forward to that one. I think opinions will vary a lot on "Blood Money", this is one of those rare cases where I recommend people give it a full listen and judge for themselves.

Group Home's second album is "A Tear for the Ghetto" (1999). Four years after there first this is another strong release from the duo of Lil Dap and Melachi. There last album was fully produced by DJ Premier, this time its only got one track from Premo (The Legacy) and lesser known producers like 8-Off, Rad, Buggy Eye,Maratta, Jiv Pos and Lil Dap looking after alot of the production which was surprisingly good. "Da Real Ghetto", track two vibes well, and Group Home comes positive talking about educating and looking after the children. My favourite track on this one is "Street Life", just one of those ill cuts I can play over and over. Next two tracks feature Guru of Gang Starr, both are decent. Some of the middle tracks dont really stand out for me, street tracks like, "Keep Rising" "12 O'Clock" and "Oh Sweet America" pick things up again. Altoghether this is another good album, Group Home benefits from some solid beats, and have improved there content on this one. A good example of this for me is "We Can Do This" where they drop some positive lyrics and a memorable chorus of "there aint no limit to life". Group Home most likely will never be one of those groups to blow, over the years they have some dropped memorable cuts, recommend checking out "Livin Proof" if you liked this album. Havnt heard of any new music coming from them as a group lately , though I have found a few Lil Dap solo appearances which are good.

Bought the special collecters edition of &quot;Tupac Resurrection&quot; (2003) earlier today. I am very impressed by the way this movie was put together, to have everything in his own words was a real highlight and this is by far the most comprehensive release about him. This movie really gives people an idea of who Pac was, and how he came up while also showing his motivation, struggles, ambitions and influences. I liked the numerous pictures of Pac at different stages of his life and the fact that his own music serves alot of the movies background. The special features menu is full of gems, my personal favourites are the never before seen interviews, and the section entitled &quot;Remembering Tupac&quot; which has music artists, family and friends recollecting. Today (June 16th) is the day Tupac was born, highly recommend getting this DVD for the collection whether your new to Pac or have followed him since his first album like myself. Gone, but never forgotten. One Love.

Big Punisher aka Christopher Rios (1971-2000) dropped his debut album "Capital Punishment" in 1998. Executive produced by Pun, Fat Joe, and Matt Life, with guest appearances coming from Black Thought of the Roots, R&B singer Joe, Miss Jones, Wyclef, Funkmaster Flex, Dead Prez, Noreaga, Prodigy, Inspectah Deck, and Busta Ryhmes. As well as appearances coming from Puns, Terror squad family (Fat Joe, Cuban Link, Prospect, Armageddon, Triple Seis). This is excellent album, and in my opinion the best latin hiphop album ever, and one of the nicest albums of the last decade, every track is entertaining, Puns flow and lyrical ability is amazing, and production is tight all throughout. "Beware" and "Super Lyrical" feat. Black Thought start the album off real strong. Next comes "Still Not a Player" feat. Joe, lead single to album, and the song that blew up on the radio, positive upbeat song that became a memorable hiphop anthem. On the next track "Dream Shatterer" Pun comes out hard, and flows well. "Punish Me" feat. Miss Jones is a relaxed track, where Pun talks about the strains of relationships, and his dedication to being a father no matter what. Next comes the banging track "You Aint a Killer". "Glamour Life" features all of Terror Squad and each one of them drops memorable verses to sick background beats. Dead Prez drop in for the short interlude "The Rain and the Sun" which has Puns best friend and half brother Cuban Link showing love.Some more nice tracks follow and then Noreaga drops in for the hook on "You Came Up", my favourite track on this album which uses horn loops and a sick bassline. Track has Pun talking about coming up in the game, and paying tribute to his Terror Squad family as well as Tupac, while celebrating making it in the game. Prodigy of Mobb Deep and Inspectah Deck of Wu-Tang drop in for "Tres Leches" (Triboro Trilogy) and album ends with "Parental Discretion" feat. Busta Rhymes. Big Punishers "Capital Punishment" is a hiphop classic, best latin hiphop album of all time, essential for every hiphop collection. R.I.P. Christopher Rios.

The "Barbershop 2: Back in Business" (2004) soundtrack is a decent fifteen track release. Mary J. Blige and Eve start the album off strong with "Not Today" a nice collabration. Next Outkast hook up with Sleepy Brown and deliver the upbeat love song "I Can't Wait", good to see Andre rhyming again, though its Sleepy smooth vocals that are the highlight of this cut for me. Chingys cut is skip material for me, then the Clipse deliver "Pussy", a decent track with a banging beat. Eve and Keyshia Cole deliver an upbeat R & B/rap collabration with "Never". G-Unit's "Unconditionally" comes next, not really feeling the hook to this track though 50,Banks and Buck come across okay. Olivia sings over a Lil Jon beat on "All", not really feeling this cut, maybe cuz I like the original more. Mos Def and floetry deliver a laidback cut with "Wanna B Where U R". I was looking forward to Mobb Deep's "One of Ours", but Mobb dont come through with anything special on this one (hopefully there saving those cuts for there album). I had never heard of the female rapper known as Morgan Smith up until this release, her collabration with 3LW is good. Spitfiya and R & B singer Anthony Hamilton deliver a standout collab with "Make it Home", this ones my favourite track at the moment. This is actually first time I have heard Spitfiya, what I like is he shows hunger in his rhymes. Keke Wyatt and Avant close off the album with the calm "Your Precious Love" which sounds like one of those old love songs from the past. I am looking forward to watching the movie, the soundtrack is worth checking out and will accompany the movie nicely. Whether its worth purchasing on its own is debatable, overall its decent musically but I think in the long run it will have limited play value.

The soundtrack for the upcoming film "Daddy's Little Girl's" (Febuary 2007) is a solid release which features appearances from a number of established singers: Anthony Hamilton, Jaheim, Musiq Soulchild, R Kelly, Tamika Scott, Adrian Hood, Whitney Houston, Cissy Houston, Dionne Warwick, Yolanda Adams, Brian Mcknight, Beyonce, Governor, Charles Moore. The album's opening track is the heartfelt "Struggle No More" (The Main Event) is an excellent collaboration between Anthony Hamiltion, Jaheim and Musiq Soulchild. I am a fan of all three singers, and am impressed by this substantial contribution which is about overcoming financial struggle, and living a better life - one of the themes of the upcoming film. This release also marks the return of Whitney Houston who delivers "Family First" a collaboration with her Mom Cissy Houston, cousin Dionne Warwick, daughter Kristina & the family. Beyonce provides a tribute to her pops on the smooth "Daddy", while gospel singer Yolande Adams "Step Aside" is about faith and god. Anthony Hamilton original "Struggle No More" is strong cut like the remix. I have not heard of Governor before (an artist signed to T.I.'s Grand Hustle Label) but was impressed with the powerful "Blood, Sweat & Tears". Charles Moore cover's Sam Cooke's a "A Change Is Gonna Come" well. "Daddy's Little Girls" soundtrack is a release worth checking out.

Common's third release was "One Day It'll All Make Sense" (1997). Chicago's own Common hooked up with some very talented artists for this one, with the likes of Black Thought, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Cee-Lo, Canibus, and De La Soul all making contributions. Common though was without a doubt the star of the show, delivering quality raps, spoken word and taking his audience to new places. Common introduced himself on "Introspective", which is followed up by the impressive "Invocation". This album is full of deep tracks "Retrospect For Life" being a good example, Common and Lauryn Hill make an excellent collaboration, Common tells a story of life and death (abortion) while Lauryn Hill delivers a moving soulful chorus. Another outstanding track is the spiritual "G.O.D." (Gaining One's Own Definition), Common elevates with some help from Cee-Lo delivering some very real messages. Common rhymes well on "Hungry" then hooks up for a solid duo with Erykah Badu called "All Night Long". Common and Black Thought deliver a killer collaboration on "Stolen Moments Pt. II", backed by No I.D.'s premium beat. Canibus makes an appearance on "Making A Name For Ourselves", and both MC's drop some quality verses. Common's father closes off the album on "Pop's Rap Part II Fatherhood". Deep is a fitting way to describe, "One Day It'll All Make Sense", the real deep tracks are the ones I enjoy most. Not to say I like every track on this album, but the majority of them are good. Recommend this release to people who like Common and enjoy deep and introspective lyrics.

Wu-Tang Clans 1993 debut group album "Enter the Wu-Tang" is a hiphop classic. How many nine member groups drop classics other than Wu, Zero. Wu-Tang consists of: RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard Raekwon, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Masta Killa. Ten years later all of these artists are well known- some more then others, there have been four more group albums, and all have dropped solo albums. "Enter the Wu-Tang" remains there best collective work in my opinion. A short but substantial twelve tracks with all production coming from RZA. First track "Bring Da Ruckus" starts off with a Kung Fu sample which leads into a distinct hardcore grimy track. "Shame on a N****" introduced me to ODB who comes across crazy on this one. "Clan in Da Front" is an introduction to all the Wu members, and the Wu's extended family, midway GZA drops killer verses. "Wu-Tang: 7th Chamber" is a six minute track which features all nine members, never had seen so many mcs on one track before with a simple dark background beat. "Can it all be so Simple" uses a more relaxed beat, and some distant background female vocals. "Mystery of Chessboxin'" is a fast paced track where the Killa Bees come out on attack, with dope choruses like "my people's are you with me where you at..". "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta F' Wit", name of track is also the chorus, the beat which rises is sick, and has the Wu giving shout outs to all there peoples. "C.R.E.A.M." is one of my all time favourite Wu songs, Method Man drops the deadly addictive chorus of "Cash, Rules, Everything, Around, Me C.R.E.A.M. Get the money Dollar, dollar bill y'all" while Raekwon and Inspectah Deck lace the track with memorable verses about growing up poor, prison, drugs and survival. "Method Man" is the albums only solo track, use of a sick piano loop combined with Meth's chorus of his name make it a very nice track. "Protect Ya Neck" is the track that helped the Wu become well known, features all nine members, not my favourite cut but like every track on this album very nice. "Tearz" is a sad track which has GZA and RZA talking about the wrong routes two young men take, samples a soul song. Albums closer is "Wu-Tang 7th Chamber Part II" a remix of earlier track, with an accelerated beat. Album's continuity is excellent, every track has alot of replay value. Highly recommend "Enter the Wu-Tang" a superior album worthy of every hiphop collection.

Mobb Deep's 2nd album "The Infamous" (1995) is excellent. This was the first Mobb Deep album I got and to this day remains my favourite Mobb Deep album, though there next album "Hell on Earth" is not to be missed either. Mobb Deep (Prodigy & Havoc), Matt Life & Schott Free executive produce, with additonal track production coming from Abstract (aka Q-Tip). Guest appearances come from: Nas, Raekwon, Big Noyd, Q-Tip, Crystal Johnson & Ghostface Killer. Thirteen tracks plus three preludes, album starts off with "The Start of your Ending" a track where Mobb Deep represents Queensbridge and the 41st side. The next track is "Survival of the Fittest" a truly banging track with P starting off with "There's a war goin on outside, no man is safe from You could run but you can't hide forever..." and in between verses the addictive chorus of "Yo, yo We livin this til the day that we die Survival of the fit only the strong survive(We still livin it)", track has wicked piano rifts, and P & Hav drop memorable verses. This is followed up by "Eye for an Eye (Your Beef is Mines)" Feat. Raekwon and Nas, everyone comes out well on this one. Mobb Deep comes out hard on "Give up The Goods" Feat. Big Noyd a track about moneymaking and survival. "Temperature's Rising" is a more relaxed track which features R & B chorus from Crystal Johnson, and a story about a man on the run. Next comes "Up North Trip" which is about getting locked up, beat to this song is sick. Followed up by two grimy tracks, "Trife Life" a story of a setup and "Q.U. Hectic" an even darker track about streetlife. "Right Back at You" feat. Big Noyd, and Wu-Tangs Ghostface & Raekwon is another good collabration track. Q-Tips produces "Drink Away the Pain" a more upbeat track where P and Hav show love for the shorties, Q-Tip drops in for a verse too, and the background use of saxophone sample makes this another standout track. "Shook ones PT. II" which is the albums lead single,is a banging hardcore track, where Mobb Deep comes out blazing, this track really turned heads, no surprise that its been remixed and sampled many times over, I love the chorus of "they shook...'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks, scared to death and scared to look". This track never gets old for me. Albums closes with "Party Over" feat. Big Noyd a track where Mobb Deep talks about taking out and taking on all contenders. Unique, Dark, Grimy, Jazzy (yes jazzy check track 1 & 14) Real, Hardcore, Memorable a few words that come to mind when I think of this album. What makes this album real to me is Mobb Deep drops thirteen tracks dark & grimy (for most part) about street life, while doing it in a way that keeps the listner entertained throghout. Theres no Collabs with 112 (Infamy), no R & B hooks on lead singles, just hardcore hiphop at its best. Highly recommend Mobb Deep's "The Infamous" for the collection.

Xzibit's debut album "At the Speed of Life" (1996) is an impressive first release, it remains my favourite of his four albums out. Executive produced by Xzibit and E-Swift this is a fifteen track release (4 Interludes). Track production comes from E-Swift, Muggs, Diamond D, Craig Sherrard, Saafir, DJ Pen One and Thayod Ausar. Guest appearances come from: Hurricane Gee, King Tee, Catashtrophe, J-Ro, Ras Kass, Tash and Saafir. Album opens with "Grand Opening" a sick instrumental which is followed up by the title track the intense banger "At the Speed of Life". Next comes "Just Maintain" a track where X rips into fakes, and the hardcore "Eyes May Shine". King Tee drops in for "Positively Negative" a nice collabration track. On "Paparazzi" Xzibit takes things to a whole new level talking about the rap game backed up by some very nice instrumentals and background female vocals. My favourite track comes is "Foundation" which has a remarkable background piano beat and Xzibit talks to his baby son about life, the police, the streets, loyalty, guns and women. Xzibit goes deep on "Carry the Weight" a track about growing up poor, death, juv detention, street life, and having alot of anger. "Plastic Surgery" feat. Ras Kas and Saafir is a track that makes reference to a number of people from Michael Jackson to Jackie Chan. Xzibit closes off the album strong with the grimy "Enemies and Friends". Xzibit successfully delivers an album to remember with "At the Speed of Life". Highly recommend this release to anyone who enjoys quality West Coast Hip Hop.

Ghostface Killah & Trife Da God deliver a grimy slept on album with "Put It on the Line" (2005). Ghost and Trife open the album up strong dropping some raw lyrics on the thugged out "Cocaine Trafficking". Trife then shines on solo talking about his life and love for Hip Hop on "Put It On the Line". Ghostface Killah then talks about his own life on "Struggle", reminiscing on years past. "Hustle Hard" samples "Paid In Full" and uses a 50 Cent chorus, Trife rhymes about his own hustle and dealing. Backed by a deadly beat, Trife delivers another standout with "Event". Trife and Ghostface team up again providing a blazing hot collaboration with the outstanding "Fire". Kryme Life and Tommy Whispers collab with Trife on "Project Soap Operas" a cut about the drama that goes down in the hood. Ghostface Killah collabs with Wigz on "Out Da Way", first time I have heard of Wigz not feeling his rhyme style. Trife talks about the cops and the criminal justice system on "Drugz", a track about being arrested for a crime he didn't do. A hungry sounding Trife rips up "Game Time", then Ghostface and Raekwon team up for "The Watch". Kool G Rap makes an appearance on "Ghost & Giancana", and Rap legend Slick Rick and Ghost's fellow Wu members Rza and Raekwon collab in paying tribute to "The Sun". The DVD is a cool bonus which adds value to this release. This is really a display of Trife's talent, and its good one, but having the support of a rap veteran like Ghost helps to. I recommend "Put It On the Line" to people who enjoy raw reality Hip Hop.

The soundtrack to "Hustle & Flow" (2005) accompanied the movie very well and is a solid release. P$C does not disappoint on the albums opener "I'm A King" (Remix). The Oscar winner "It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp" written by Three Six Mafia and performed by Terrence Howard (AKA DJAY) is a great track. I was really happy to see a Rap group win that award. Next up Eightball & MJG deliver the smooth "Tell Me Why". DJay's "Whoop that Trick" is a banging fight cut, the kind you blast in the ride, or listen to before hitting the gym. Boyz N Da Hood provides another good track with "Carbon 15's, A.K.'s & Mac 11's". A number of average tracks follow then Terrence Howard impresses again on the albums title track "Hustle And Flow" (It Ain't Over). I can't say I am much of a Mike Jones fan, but "Still Tippin" is definitely one of his better tracks and the (It's A Man's World Remix) works. P$C provides a hardcore banger with the grimy "Murder Game". The man behind the rhymes Al Kapone adds his own musical contribution with the stellar "Get Crunk Get Buck". Terrence Howard closes the album off with a skit in "Man Ain't Like A Dog". I hope Terrence Howard gets the credit he deserves in the years to come, good acting, impressive rhyming from an actor, two thumbs up for the "Hustle & Flow" Soundtrack.

K-OS (Kevin Brereton) debut album &quot;Exit&quot; is one of the nicest Canadian hiphop albums out. What I really like about his music is that it is conscientious, thought provoking positive original hiphop. K-OS goes his own way, writes and produces his own music and stays real throughout. First track &quot;Fantastique&quot; starts off the album with K-OS confronting the current state of hiphop. &quot;Call Me&quot; is my favourite track on &quot;Exit&quot;, K-OS lyrics and singing ability really shine on this track, instrumentals are addictive, this is one song I keep on regular rotation. This is followed up by &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; another nice track, which would be remixed for a hidden track at end. &quot;Superstar Pt.1&quot; is a Reggae like track, dont have much attachment to it, but I like how K-OS experiments. &quot;Freeze&quot; has K-OS dropping a story, tracks got a deep and dark feeling to it, while kicking some knowledge like hiphop is about more than the money. &quot;Higher&quot; is a relaxed soulful song, &quot;Follow Me&quot; feat. Red One (Rascalz) is a solid collab, love the way K-OS uses his vocals on this track the simple repetive &quot;He told me son follow me and I will come to you&quot; keeps you nodding. &quot;Superstar 2&quot; has K-OS singing to a pop sounding background, this was surprising to me, what was even more surprising was I liked it. &quot;Superstar Part Zero&quot; closes off the album well. K-OS &quot;Exit&quot; is a throughly enjoyable album which has alot of variety: Hiphop, R&amp;B, Pop, Reggae and even classical , definetly worth having in the collection though it will be an album thats slept on. Don't Sleep.

James Blunt debut album was "Back To Bedlam" (2004). I recently got the chance to check this one out and I was highly impressed. "You're Beautiful" got a lot of Radio play where I live, and I have never gotten tired of listening to this smooth ballad (which also has a highly unknown Hip Hop Remix). People I know generally tend to love this one or hate it! - I personally find Blunt's singing to be soulful and memorable. The album's first track & single is "High", an upbeat rock soul cut, where Blunt appreciates the early morning dawn, talks to a love and provides a powerful opener. "Wisemen" is another solid single while the sad "Goodbye My Lover" is a very powerful track where Blunt reminisces and says goodbye to a past love who has moved on. Blunt continues to sing with passion on tracks like "Tears and Rain" and "Out Of My Mind", while "So Long Jimmy" is a dedication to Jimmy Hendrix and Jim Morrison. I love the instrumentals to "Cry", while Blunt's lyrics and singing about War is on point on the closer "No Bravery". Reading some of the other reviews, I see people bashing this for being "sappy", or hating it from overplay - while everyone is entitled to their opinion I don't agree. I see Blunt as someone who values life, based upon his own life and soldier experiences. "Back To Bedlam" is an album I recommend for the collection.

Chilling in the late night now listening to Anthony Hamilton's sophomore album "Comin' From Where I'm From" (2003). Listening to this release is a pleasure, Anthony Hamilton laces this record with soulful vocals, taking his audience through an enjoyable journey. I became familiar with Hamilton a few years ago, when he made a memorable guest appearance on Jadakiss single "Why". North Carolina's Anthony Hamilton opens this release up with a heartfelt tribute to his mother on "Mama Knew Love". My favourite track on this release is the sensational single "Charlene", Anthony Hamilton shines on this joint about losing one's loved one. I especially like the chorus to this memorable joint. On the follow up track "I'm A Mess", Hamilton mourns the women who walked out of his life without an explanation. Another single on this release and highlight is the title track "Comin From Where I'm From", Anthony Hamilton recalls how life can be away around his way, while singing about more heartbreak on "Lucille". Latoya Williams and Anthony Hamilton provide a duet with "My First Love". I appreciate the passion/realness Anthony Hamilton puts into his music, the end result is substantial music, that will stand the test of time. I recommend "Comin' From Where I'm From" for the collection.

Outstanding. Outkast have done it again. On there sixth release they have delivered a excellent double album, this time doing it individually on two discs: Antwan &quot;Big Boi&quot; Patton presents &quot;Speakerboxxx&quot; &amp; Andre &quot;3000&quot; Benjamin delivers &quot;The Love Below&quot; (2003). Executive produced by Outkast and Antonio &quot;LA&quot; Reid&quot;. Like the coverart and insert to this album, original as usual. Both Big Boi and Andre take things to a whole new level on there respective albums providing extraordinarily creative and original albums to enjoy. Beats, lyricism (Big Boi), singing (Andre), guest appearances and production are tight on both albums. Five of my current favourite tracks from Speakerboxxx include (by order of appearance):1. &quot;Ghettomusick&quot;- Crazy sounding first track love the way it alternates speeds. Great starting track.2. &quot;Unhappy&quot;- For me this is a profoundly deep sounding track, smooth background vocals by Sleepy Brown and Debra Killings are very nice.3. &quot;The Way You Move&quot; feat. Sleepy Brown- The albums first single is excellent. Sleepy Brown's vocals excell and the use of horns work very well in creating a memorable track.4. &quot;Flip/Fop Rock&quot; feat. Killer Mike and Jay-Z - My favourite rap collabration track on this release is this track. Never thought I would see Jay-Z on a track with Big Boi, the end result is a fastpaced banger.5. &quot;Reset&quot; feat. Khujo Goodie and Cee-lo - I have always enjoyed Goodie Mobb appearances on Outkast albums, this track being another one.When I bought this I knew Andre would be mostly singing as opposed to rhyming on &quot;The Love Below&quot;. This may disappoint some Hip Hop heads. I thought I might feel like that, till I remembered what a gifted artist Andre is, whether singing or rhyming his music is music that I enjoy. With Big Boi looking after rhyming, Andre is free to experiment a bit more. I very much prefer him as a rhymer but I appreciate his orginality and willingness to go out on limb on this one. The end result is an easy listening cd to chill too which will have less appeal for some rap fans and more for people who enjoy creative experimentation. Five of my favourite tracks from &quot;The Love Below&quot; include (by order of appearance):1. &quot;Spread&quot;- One of the tracks where Andre rhymes a bit, between a memorable chorus he sings.2. &quot;She Lives in My Lap&quot; feat. Rosario Dawson- The beat that comes and goes on this love dedication is insane, a real standout track which only gets better and better.3. &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;- relaxed track, with a completely different sound to it. Sort of sounds like some kind of oldschool track.4. &quot;Pink &amp; Blue&quot;- At first I thought this track was for younger women, buts its actually for the older ladies. Nice instrumental.5. &quot;A Life in the Day of Benjamin Andre&quot;- Andre finishes off the album by rapping introspectively.It has been almost been ten years since Outkast dropped there first album. Many of there albums that followed are now regarded as Hip Hop classics. Whether that will be the case with this release is to be seen. Highly recommend getting Outkast's sixth release &quot;Speakerboxxx: Love Below&quot; an exceptional double album definetly worth having in the collection.

Akir's (Always Keep It Real) debut album "Legacy" (2006) is a slept on gem. This album was executive produced by Immortal Technique and quietly dropped in March with little fanfare. It's great to see this release available on Amazon now. Guest appearances come from Jean Grae, Immortal Technique, Abiodun Oyewole, Hasan Salaam, Akua Wilder, Kyrystl Yardon, Mas D, Veks One and Poison Pen. Listening to Akir throughout this album I was impressed with his on point rhymes, this cat is truly a gifted MC - his lyrics are deep and meaningful. Exceptional production is another highlight of this release and comes from Southpaw (Akir's Brother and Business Partner) who produces seven tracks, R'sonist, DJ Static, Dada, Y.G., Fyre Dept, Illastrate, Den'D Productions, DJ N'finit and Apex. This is one of those album's that I can pop in and listen to from start to finish without hitting the skip button, my favorite cut's are "Legacy" an exceptional and beautiful collaboration about life between Akir, Mas D and Vek's One, the blazing hot "Mood Music", "Treason" with Immortal Technique and the outstanding "No Longer My Home". Akir's "Legacy" is a release I highly recommend checking out.Track Listing:1. The Initiation2. Rites of Passage3. Mood Music4. Grind5. Treason - Immortal Technique6. This Is Your Life Pt. 27.

Daz Dillinger (A.K.A. Delmar Arnaud) released "Don't Go 2 Sleep Ep" in 2001, which features material from 1995-96 when 2Pac and Daz Dillinger were label mates on Death Row. Pac's mom Afeni Shakur would go on to sue Daz for this unauthorized release and use of Pac's name, stating she had never been informed/given consent. The "Wake Up My People" (Intro) has Pac laughing and telling his enemies to go to sleep, the follow up title track "Don't Go To Sleep" has Pac kicking some thugged out rhymes, while Young Gotti (better known as Kurupt) drops some of his own. "First 2 Bomb" features the background singing of Tanya Herron, while Dillinger and Pac drop lyrical bombs. Pac and his brethren the Outlawz provide an outstanding cut with "They Don't Give a Fucc About Us" (a track found on the better dayz album) - Pac's hunger and raw emotion are definitely evident on this cut. "Let's Fight" & "I'm Dumpin" are similar thugged out track which lack decent production. "Only Move 4 Tha Money" is the Ep's last standout track, good lyrics, solid production. This release was shelved and has been released with different versions over the years. Rest of album consists of mostly originals and mixes (depending on which version you have). I posted the album cover, as well as the original picture which influenced the artwork. The "Don't Go 2 Sleep Ep" is a decent release, which die hard fan's (like myself) of Pac's music may want to check out. 3.5.

The Regulator returns with his new album "In the Mid-Nite Hour" (2005). I have always appreciated the smooth G-Funk melodies Warren G has provided over the years, the album opens with the laidback "We Need Each Other" feat. Chevy and Bishop Lamont. The next standout and my personal favorite is "I Need A Light", Warren G and Nate Dogg deliver another impressive collaboration, Warren reminisces while Nate Dogg laces the track with a chorus. The album's first single "Get U Down" has Warren G, B-Real and Side Effect delivering an inspirational/semi-political track about staying up and positive no matter what's going down, I am feeling this cut. Not feeling the weird sample used on "Wheels Keep Spinning", Warren G's lyrics are on point though. 213 reunite for the smooth "PYT" (Pretty Young Thing) then Raphael Saadiq makes an appearance on the positive "Walk These Streets". "Turn It Up Loud" feat. Chuck Taylor vibes well, Warren G rhymes with confidence, in another upbeat standout. The title track "Mid-Nite Hour" feat. Nate Dogg is a track about hitting ones ladies up late night; "I Like Dat" is more of the same. My favorite instrumental on this one is "Ahh" Warren G collabs with Bishop Lamont, Frank Lee White and Chuck Taylor in a deep standout. Warren G closes the album off on a good note with "All I Ask For You" feat. Frank Lee White, Bishop Lamont and Chevy and the remix "Get U Down Part 2" feat. B-Real, Side Effect, Snoop and Ice Cube (who drops a tight verse). Overall "In the Mid-Nite Hour" is another solid album from Warren G, one I recommend picking up. 3.5.

The soundtrack for the 1999 Columbia movie "In too Deep" is a good one, with an assortment of Rap and R&B tracks that keep the listner entertained throughout. Executive produced by R. Spendlove and F.Fitzpatrick, with more production coming from Poke, Tone and Marc Jordan. Nas and his prodigy Nature start the soundtrack off with the title track "In too Deep" a strong track with violin background. Wu-tang members Method Man and Redman drop "Tear the Roof off" next an upbeat track. Up and coming rapper Ali Vegas drops "The Specialist" and does not dissapoint. This is followed by R Kelly track "Use to me Spending" feat. Nokio and Jaz-Ming. 50 Cent comes out hard on "How to Rob" and its surprising to see a track like this on soundtrack. 50 tears into alot of big name rappers, not the best way to make friends. All the same its entertaining. Next comes Trick Daddys "Thug Money" and Jagged Edge and J. Dupri on "Keys to the range". Mobb Deep come through on "Where Ya Heart at" and this is the nicest track on the soundtrack in my opinion. David Hollister drops a classy R&B track called "Give Me A reason" and Jill Scott follows through with a nice relaxed track called "Dreamin'". Relatively unknown teen group Imajin drops a track called "Something about Love", and Mobb Deep closes the album powerfully with "Quiet Storm" (Remix). The movie was good and so is the soundtrack. Its not amazing, but you enjoy it, and the variety of artists ranging from household hiphop names like Mobb Deep and Nas, and up and coming (at the time) artists like Ali Vegas and 50 Cent make it a good hiphop album. Same thing goes with R&B side to it R Kelly, David Hollister, Jill Scott hold it down. There are alot of bad soundtracks out these days but occasionally a decent one comes out and impresses like "In Too Deep".

Westside Connection's (Ice Cube, Mack 10, WC) second album is &quot;Terrorist Threats&quot; (2003). Believe it or not it has been seven years since there last album &quot;Bow Down&quot;. This release is 14 tracks long with two multimedia additions. After a short intro, &quot;Call 9-1-1&quot; gets things started well, like the chorus says this ones a banger. Awile back first track I heard off this album on the radio was &quot;Gangsta Nation&quot; feat. Nate Dogg, this is a memorable cut and my favourite at the moment. Westside Connection and Nate Dogg collabrate well on the lead single. Next couple of cuts dont really standout that much for me, maybe with more play they will. &quot;So Many Rappers in Love&quot; definitely does standout though, this a track where Westside Connection tears into MC's who used to act gangsta, fake thugs, and those who overuse R &amp; B collabrations. While some people might think this is hating, I see it just as them expressing there views on how the games changed and how some rappers change there styles to get mainstream appeal. Westside Connection is basically sick of the never ending amount of R &amp; B/Rap collabrations out these days on the radio and are speaking out about it. Backed by a nice beat and a exceptional chorus Westside Connection delivers a great track with &quot;You Gotta Have Heart&quot; a cut about surviving and thriving in the game. The title track &quot;Terrorist Threats&quot; has the connection dropping some more hardcore rhymes backed by a pounding beat. The closing track is &quot;Superstar&quot; (Double Murder = Double Platinum), a track where Westside Connection talks about the industry, media and how being shot or having a criminal record can make selling units easier regardless of actual skill. By dropping some bangers and not holding back on there opinions on &quot;Terrorist Threats&quot; Westside Connection have delivered a strong album worth checking out.

Kayne West's debut album &quot;College Dropout&quot; (2004) is good but not deserving of all the hype it has received. Kayne West production skills have been excellent, so I was interested in seeing how his MC skills are. The problem I find when listening to him, is he is not a gifted MC, his lyrics are for the most part average, and the way he curls his words can at times be annoying. The high number of skits and filler don't help either. That said there are some highlights to this album, for me they are for the most part well chosen collaboration tracks like: &quot;All Fall's Down&quot; feat. Syleena Johnson, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; feat. Jay-Z, &quot;Get Em High&quot; Feat. Talib Kweli/Common and the hit single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; with Twista/Jamie Foxxx (which was already released on Twista's album). By teaming up with some of Rap's talented lyricists Kayne provides some memorable tracks. One track that Kayne does shine on solo is &quot;Family Business&quot; an outstanding cut- deep, introspective, real and uplifting. Kayne comes off best on tracks like that , because he is providing something different, more then the typical cut you here today.End of day this is an album worth checking out if your a Rocafella fan, from Chicago or just looking for some fresh music. 3.5.

On "Stillmatic" Nas drops a gem, which brings you back to the days of "Illmatic". "Stillmatic" his fifth album is in his own words his rebirth. "Ether" has to be the strongest diss track ive heard since Pacs "Hitemup" so it only makes sense that it has the vocals of 2pac and Nas lyrically kills his foe Jay-Z on this track. "Got Yourself a Gun" is laced with sick beats, and uses the sopranos theme music. The illest track on the album though is without a doubt "One Mic" a quiet groove that steadily increases in energy and intensity, untill Nas lets out his fury, then reverses this formula on the final verse. Lyrically its ill, as Nas talks about his thoughts on media, and his haters. The next track is called "2nd Childhood" produced by DJ Premier, and showcases Nas storytelling skills to laid back beats. "Destroy and Rebuild" is another diss track, this time aimed at Nature and Cormega and Nas delivers it deeply. A rebirth album, needs to have AZ and it does, as Nas and AZ come toghther to drop "The Flyest", a dope track with both MCs dropping knowledge, and of all their collabrations I have to say this is nicest successor to "Lifes a Bitch". On "Rule" feat. Amerie, Nas goes deep, talking about the world, struggle, peace & hiphop and comes out with a very memorable track. "My Country","What Goes Around" and bonus track "Every Ghetto" finish off the album perfectly, as Nas talks to you about what is important in reality. Nas rebirth on "Stillmatic" is a major success, laced throughout with memorable beats, ill lyrics, and overall tight production. Classic album from one of hiphops best.

Robin Thicke's second studio album was "The Evolution of Robin Thicke" (2006). I only recently came across Thicke's music and have been really impressed. This sixteen track album features guest appearances from Faith Evans, Lil Wayne & Pharell. The album's opener is a soulful duet with the talented Faith Evans on "Got 2 To Be Down". Thicke then looks to change, find a lost love and overcome his blues on another standout in "Complicated". "Would That Make You Love Me" another solid track leads up to Thicke's second single "Lost Without U" an excellent track which vibes real well. The upbeat "Ask Myself" follows, then Thicke provides something different collaborating with Rapper Lil Wayne on "All Night Wrong". Thicke then changes things up providing the refreshing and creative "Everything I Can't Have" backed by some distinct instrumentals. Slow ballad's follow in "Teach U A Lesson" & "I Need Love". The first Robin Thicke track I ever heard was "Wanna Love U Girl" a memorable collaboration with Pharell, backed by a bouncy beat the two provide an enjoyable track. The album's third single is "Can U Believe", Thicke sings soulfully to his love backed by some laidback production. Thicke's second collaboration with Lil Wayne is "Shooter". Found it interesting that Thicke delved into R & B/Rap collobarations. I recently watched a youtube video which had Thicke collaborating live with 50 Cent for an outstanding track called "Follow Me Lead" which will be featured on 50 Cent's upcoming solo album. Thicke keeps things moving providing the upbeat "Cocaine" and elevates with "2 The Sky". This album is full of highlights, the substantial "Lonely World" is yet another, Thicke sings with passion, telling different people's stories while lacing the track with some smooth vocals. The album's closer and longest track is "Angels" an exceptional slow jam. The variety of quality music that Thicke provides throughout "The Evolution of Robin Thicke" makes this one a keeper for newcomers and dedicated fans alike.

Chicago's own Common returns with his sixth album "Be" (2005) a short release full of conciseness feel good music which is backed by impressive production from Kayne West & Jay Dee. Common starts the album off strong rhyming with hunger on the title track, backed by some memorable production. The album's first single is "Corners" feat. The Last Poets, a very non-commercial cut where Common reps the streets. Common then rhymes about the ladies on the laidback "Go". An early favourite of mine is "Faithful" a collaboration where Common, Bilal and John Legend shine. "Love Is" is simply outstanding, Common delivers some very on point rhymes about love and life. Kayne West and Common team up for the premium "The Food", then meet up again for "They Say" which features some smooth vocals from John Legend. The albums closer and longest track is "It's Your World, Pt. 1 & 2" feat. Bilal, Common's pops also makes an appearance once again delivering some words of wisdom. This whole album vibes well, Common seems to be in an especially good place these days and he has taken his audience along for a refreshing ride delivering insightful and positive lyrics backed by the production he deserves. Highly recommend "Be" to Common fans and to people who enjoy music with substance.

Tupac Shakurs 5th album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; is one of his best. 1996 was a busy year for Shakur, this would be the last album he ever saw come out, and his only double album while he was alive. Two discs, with a total of 26 tracks. Disc one is full of tracks that would become party anthems tracks like &quot;California Love&quot; feat Dr. Dre, &quot;How do you want it&quot; feat. KC and Jojo, and &quot;2 of Amerikaz most Wanted&quot; feat. Death row labelmate Snoop. &quot;I aint Mad at Cha&quot; was a dedication track to fallen homies, with background pianos beats. Best track on this side though for me was &quot;Life goes on&quot;, one of my all time favourite tracks, where Pac talks about a lost friend, remember when they bumped it on the locals news after his passing, its one of those tracks where Pac goes incredibly deep. &quot;Heartz of Men&quot;, &quot;Only God can Judge Me&quot; are two more memorable tracks on this side. Disc two starts off with the powerfull &quot;Shorty Wanna be a Thug&quot;. Tracks like &quot;Holla at Me&quot;, and &quot;Wonder why they Call you B****&quot; follow and are memorable. &quot;Thug Passion&quot; is a track for the ladies, with and Pacs Outlawz make a good guest appearance. &quot;Picture me Rolling&quot; is one of the nicest tracks on this side, laid back track, where Pac talks about cruising, the police, and living thug life. &quot;Run Tha Streets&quot; and &quot;Heaven Aint Hard to Find&quot; close off the album well. Tupac seemed to know how close death was, and some of the tracks on this album, and of course his next one show this. Also he never hesitated to show his emotions, and after being locked up for a year he was not only angry but ready to take the rap game on lock once again which he did. &quot;All Eyes on Me&quot;, classic hiphop album for every collection.

I also only recently came across Lyfe Jennings "268-192" (2004). This album really impresses me; Lyfe's a gifted singer, with a story worth listening to. After a short intro and interlude, Lyfe delivers the goods with the outstanding "Must Be Nice", an addictive melody that this reviewer can play over and over. The follow up cut "The Way I Feel About You" is smooth and vibes well. Lyfe delves deeper on tracks like "She Got Kids", "Hypothetically" and "Smile" providing substantial & heartfelt music. "Greedy" is about a woman who uses her own seed, to gain revenge while "Stick Up Kid" has Lyfe recalling his days of being a thug. Lyfe challenges the myth that men shouldn't "Cry" with a deep slow track. On the upbeat "My Life", Lyfe sings about being poor and happy during the toughest of times and ends this track with some inspirational words. The closing track is my favourite, in an album full of memorable tracks "Let's Do This Right" a dedication to the incarcerated stands out the most for me. Lyfe knows what its like to be locked down, and shines like the sun while singing this one. I respect how Lyfe has turned his life around and come up on top, and in turn inspires other people to through his singing and spoken word interludes. I highly recommend adding Lyfe's diamond "268-192" to the collection.

Lyfe Jenning's sophomore album is the "The Phoenix" (2006). Like many others I was really impressed by Lyfe's debut "Lyfe 268-192". Everything about that album made it one of my favorite R & B/Soul releases of recent years. I don't think this album has the continuity of the last, far to many interludes, and I am not impressed by the first two track's, Young Buck (who I am a fan of) seems who out of place on "Slow Down" while "Goodbye" is a bit to lengthy for my liking. The first track I am feeling is "Let's Stay Together", Ohio's Lyfe sings with passion in a track about overcoming and staying with one's love. Lyfe then provides something different with "Biggie *****" comparing himself to the late great Notorious B.I.G. in a track which is humorous. Lyfe shines on the outstanding rags to riches "Ghetto Superman". Lyfe talks about young women discovering their sexuality on "S.E.X." feat. LaLa Brown. The slow "Down Here, Up There" has a soulful Lyfe having a conversation with god. Lyfe then hits all the right notes on "The River" paying tribute to God while recalling his life. The album's second Rap/R&B; collaboration is better then the former, as Lyfe teams up with Project Pat and Three 6 Mafia for the positive "Still Here". My favorite track on this album is easily "Radio", Lyfe delivers an exceptional soulful and feel good joint. Lyfe does his own rendition of Tupac Shakur's "Keep Ya Head Up" then closes the album off on a strong note with the powerful "I'll Always Love You". While "The Phoenix'" does lack some continuity Lyfe delivers a number of outstanding track's making this one a definite keeper for fans.

Saigon's "Warning Shots" (2004) is a release I highly recommend checking out. For the last couple of years New York's Saigon has been tearing it up on mixtape scene and will be making his major debut soon. For now he has delivered the goods with a collection of his best work. "Favorite Things" gets things started. First real standout and my personal favourite is "Let A Nigga Know", a hungry sounding Saigon rips up a sick beat with some raw lyrics. This is followed up by another excellent track, the banging piano laced "Come Again". Saigon continues to impress dropping more grimey and memorable premium tracks with "Stocking Cap" and "NY Streetz". Saigon takes a minute to talk about "L.O.V.E." a track about the ladies. Laidback "Huh Mama" has Sai asking women if they will be down for there men when there down and out and in jail. Mekka Millz and the still slept on Ali Vegas drop in for another banger called "We Want In". Saigon goes political on the powerful "Kiss the Babies" a track about war, poverty, drugs, and corrupt government. Sai then gets innovative on the unique "Pop Quiz (Multiple Choice)". "Yes" is another ill track, love that Alchemist beat. "If (My Mommy)" goes real deep this a track dedicated to his mom, where Sai talks about growing up, struggle, jail, the ups and downs of life and love. Saigon then closes things off strong with some well chosen freestyles. Of all the up and coming MC's I have to say Sai has impressed me the most. Saigon excels at delivering reality rap with "Warning Shots", this ones for the collection.

Philly's own Cassidy (Barry Reese) returns with his second album "I'm a Hustla" (2005). Unfortunately he won't be out and about celebrating the release of this album as he got locked down over a week ago and is being charged with homicide, conspiracy and weapons violations. Cassidy's lawyer stated these allegations are not true, and evidence will show he was not involved. I hope this is the case.Cassidy begins his album with "The Problem vs The Hustla", he takes on two personalities and battles himself, in what is a unique track and a good way to start the album. Cassidy then rips up "I'm a Hustla" sampling Jay-Z vocals (Dirt Off Your Shoulder) love this cut. Next up are two impressive street banger's "On The Grind" and "Crack". The single "B-Boy Stance" follows, more of a club track that I am not really feeling. Cassidy gets back to his hustling with "A.M. to P.M.", lines like "Hop out the bronco and O.J. him" are memorable. The album's first guest appearances come from Nas and Quan who hook up with Cassidy for the smooth "Can't Fade Me", Quan provides a first class chorus, and all three rhyme well. Cassidy then switches things up dropping five tracks for/about the ladies and partying. While there not bad, they don't grab my attention, seen this formula to many times before. Things pick up when Cassidy collabs with two more of Rap's relatively young guns Lil Wayne & Fabolous on "Six Minutes of Death". Cassidy then takes some time aside and enlists Dr. Daniel for "The Message", a track about the challenges of being black, racial and Hip-Hop profiling, incarceration, segregation, and the million man march- Cass and Dr. Daniel kick some knowledge on the albums most conscious track. Mary J Blige is an R & B legend, and the remix to "I'm a Hustla" is off the hook, Blige's singing and chorus enhance an already great track. Cassidy provides an entertaining release with "I'm a Hustla", a must have for his fans and an album I recommend checking out.

Trae's latest album is "Restless" (2006) a seventeen-track release. I have listened to Trae on collaborations with Z-Ro but this is the first album of his that I have come across. Repping Houston Trae provides a solid release, which is laced with impressive production and has numerous guest appearances. Trae remains the star of the show. Trae rips up "Real Talk" rhyming with a fast flow. One of my favourite tracks on this album is the title cut "Restless", Trae and Young Noble of the Outlawz deliver an excellent collaboration. Trae shines again when delivering "The Truth" with Billy Cook and then provides the powerful "Song Cry". The later cut is off the hook, Trae puts made heart into this cut while taking his audience through his life. Trae delivers excellent on point lyrics rhyming with a lot of hunger on these tracks. Trae sings on the laidback "Quit Calling Me" while telling a lady to leave him be. Another exceptional track is "No Help", cousins Trae and Z-Ro deliver a memorable joint, about riding solo and not needing anyone to make it. The highlight of this track for me is the chorus. Trae brings some more variety to the album by enlisting R & B singer Mya for "Matter of Time", Trae rhymes with confidence while Mya delivers a strong chorus. Southern catz may enjoy the bangers more then myself, what I really liked about this release though is Trae's genuine introspective cuts. Like Z-Ro he remains slept on. I am impressed by this release; Trae delivers quality music making "Restless" an album worth looking into.

Guru (A.K.A. Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, Keith Edward Elam) returns with "Jazzmatazz, Vol. 4: The Hip Hop Jazz Messenger: Back to the Future" (2007) a sixteen track release which features guest appearances from Slum Village, Common, Bob James, Damian Marley, Kem, Vivian Green, Raheem DeVaughn, Bobby Valentino, Ronnie Laws, Dionne Farris, Omar, Shelly Harland, Brownman, Blackalicious, Caron Wheeler & David Sanborn. As one half of the groundbreaking group Gangstarr, Guru released many memorable albums, he has also succeeded in delivering memorable solo releases in the Jazzmatazz series. At fourty year's old, Guru is one of the Rap game's veteran's who continues to deliver relevant music, that old and new fans alike can enjoy. This release opens up with "Cuz I'm Jazzy" which has Guru teaming up with T3 & Elzhi of Slum Village. Next up is a highlight track in the single "State of Clarity" - Guru, Common and Bob James (Jazz Keyboards) deliver a substantial track about being true to ones self and avoiding the trife life. Guru tag teams "Stand Up (Some Things'll Never Change) with Damian Marley who provides the chorus. Guru rhymes about change and creating a better future on "Look To The Sun". Guru shines on the introspective "Connection" feat. Kem- delivering more substantial lyrics like "Its so real when it comes from the heart, from deep down inside". Guru flipts the script some and slows things down with "Fine and Free" which features some soulful vocals from Vivian Green, rhyming with confidence - Guru show's his love for Hip Hop and the ladies while repping himself and giving his opinion on sell out MC's. Up and coming soul singer Raheem DeVaughn makes an appearance on "Wait On Me", while Bobby Valentino & Guru travel worldwide on "International". Guru kicks some on point rhymes backed by the sounds of Jazz, Funk & Blues musician Ronnie Laws on "This Is Art". Guru rhymes about a woman whos after him on "Fly Magnetic" backed by some vocals from Dionne Farris, then colloborates with British Singer Omar on "The Jazz Style". Guru takes a trip looking for a special lady on "Follow The Signs" backed by smooth vocals from Shelly Harland. My favourite track at the moment is the deep "The Universal Struggle" feat. Brownman, Guru delivers some excellent lyrics on this conscious track about how people worldwide face the same struggles, talking about showing resilience in the face of danger and overcoming. Guru then collabs with Rap duo Blackalicious on "Infinite" - letting it be known he won't be leaving the game anytime soon and that the music he delivers goes beyond simple rhymes to deep thoughts. Guru provides another international collaboration this time with female British Singer Caron Wheeler (hook) on "Kissed The World" a track about George Bush and the War. Guru closes off the album with "Living Legend" backed by the sounds of Saxophonist David Sanborn. It's refreshing to listen to a grounded MC who has a significant social conscious, and drops positive on point rhymes. "Jazzmatazz, Vol. 4: The Hip Hop Jazz Messenger: Back to the Future" is a strong release worth checking out.

Almost ten years after O.C.(Omar Credle) debuted with &quot;Word...Life&quot; (1994) he still remains very much an underground artist. Whenever I hear people talking about slept on MC's, O.C.'s name usually comes up. I think he has maintained this status by always staying real to himself, and while this may not sell records I appreciate it. &quot;Jewelz&quot; (1997) is his second of three albums, his first is another album not to be missed. O.C.'s lyricial ability shines through on this release, production is tight and comes from established producers DJ Premier, Lord Finesse OGEE, Buckwild, Da Beatminerz and the Show. Guest appearances come from MCs I like: Big L (R.I.P.), Organized Konfusion, Freddie Foxxx (Bumpy Knuckles). After intro, DJ Premier produced &quot;It's My World&quot; starts things off very strong, O.C. spits ill verse after verse, backed by an eerie beat to remember. Next comes the Piano thumping &quot;War Games&quot;, which is followed up with a deep tribute by O.C. to his wife on &quot;Can't Go Wrong&quot;, and a surreal representation of himself on &quot;Chosen One&quot;. &quot;Dangerous&quot; feat. Big L and &quot;Win the G&quot; feat. Freddie Foxxx are solid collabrations, both these artists are similar to O.C. in a way, in that they may never blow up but have definite underground followings. Big L only became more known to the mainstream after his death. &quot;Far from Yours&quot; feat. Yvette Michele is a relaxed Rap/R&amp;B collab which works, I like the storytelling at the end of this track. Freddie Foxxx makes another good appearance on &quot;M.U.G.&quot; and O.C. follows through with more memorable tracks , two that really standout for me include the dedication track &quot;You and Yours&quot; and the albums closer the title track &quot;Jewelz&quot;. This album gets five stars from me as I get alot of enjoyment from listening to it and still listen to it alot many years later. O.C. is a talented &amp; underated lyricist, who has a memorable flow and &quot;Jewelz&quot; is definetly an album to have if you enjoy O.C.'s music like I do.

Bubba Sparxxx (Warren Anderson Mathis) third album is "The Charm" (2006). Georgia's Sparxxx provides a short eleven-track release, which has guest appearances from Killer Mike, Cool Breeze, Petey Pablo, Sleepy Brown, Scar, Frankie J, Mr. Collipark and the Ying Yang Twins. Bubba opens the album up with "Represent", talking about where he stands - don't push the country boy around to much, he states that most people were not paying attention to the Notorious B.I.G. till after he died. Backed by a laidback beat Sparxxx then drops a party track with "Heat It Up". Killer Mike and Cool Breeze make the albums first guest appearances on the standout "Claremont Lounge", Bubba Sparxxx does the chorus, while all three tell the story. "As The Rim Spins" is a bland track, then Sleepy Brown laces "That Man" with some smooth vocals, Bubbas rhyming gets a bit monotonous on this one. The albums second single is "The Otherside", Bubba teams up with Petey Pablo and Sleepy Brown for an outstanding cut, Sleepy provides some exceptional singing, while Petey Pablo and Bubba tag team this joint dropping some on point lyrics. Up and coming singer Scar one of Big Boi's Purple Ribbon crew drops in for the decent "Ain't Life Grand". My favorite track is the deep "Run Away", Bubba delivers memorable lyrics while Frankie J provides some smooth singing for a masterful track. The upbeat yet lengthy "Wonderful" follows. The albums first single is "Ms. New Booty", its a radio hit at the moment so it obviously has appeal to a lot of people, skip material for me though, I am not a fan of the Ying Yang Twins or this type of joint which I consider garbage. The albums closer is "Hey! (A Lil Gratitude)", Bubba wants some gratitude, in other words he wants to make some paper, he also reps being a country boy with pride. I preferred Bubba's last album, as he went a lot deeper (unfortunately he did not get the sales he deserved), "The Charm" is a solid release, with a variety of cuts that are radio and club friendly, hopefully Sparxxx will get the gratitude he has been looking for. 3.5.

DMX's fifth and possibly last album is &quot;Grand Champ&quot; (2003). Executive produced by Earl Simmons (DMX), Darrin &quot;Dee&quot; Dean and Joaquin &quot;Waah&quot; Dean the album runs in at twenty tracks (+3 skits). I have always enjoyed DMX's music, and have followed him through every album starting with &quot;It's Dark and Hell is Hot&quot; (1998) to this release. Album starts off strong with the piano laced &quot;Dog Intro&quot; and introspective &quot;My Life&quot; feat. Chinky. First real standout track for me is &quot;Where the Hood At&quot; the blazing lead single a hardcore street banger to get pumped up to. This ones been on the radio for awile, still loving it. &quot;Get It On The Floor&quot; feat. Swizz Beatz is a party track, definetly club material, fastpaced with a crazy beat. 50 Cent and Styles P drop in for the hardcore &quot;Shot Down&quot; a strong three way collabration. DMX comes out hard backed by a heavy banging rock beat on &quot;F*** Ya'll&quot;, X's lyrics and the chorus to this track make this another standout track for me. Jadakiss and Eve drop in for &quot;We're Back&quot; another nice track. Diplomat's Cam'ron collabos with X on the rugged &quot;We Go Hard&quot; and bloodlines Big Stan makes a good appearance on &quot;We 'Bout to Blow&quot;. My favourite track at the moment is the DJ Scratch produced &quot;The Rain&quot;, DMX goes real deep on this one dropping memorable lyrics and the simple addictive chorus of: &quot;Now I know, only I, can stop the rain&quot;. &quot;Don't Gotta Go Home&quot; is a relaxed R &amp; B/Rap collabration, Monica's smooth and soulful vocals are very impressive. DMX pays tribute to a friend who died on &quot;A'Yo Kato&quot; Feat. Magic &amp; Val another deep standout track. DMX's evolution from a guy who did not really believe in god, to one who loves him now is displayed on &quot;Thank You&quot; feat. Patti Labelle. I think its important to find that happiness in life and though this may not be the kind of track hardcore Hip Hop heads like I enjoy this track and the prayer that follows. Bonus track &quot;On Top&quot; feat. Big Stan is okay though not really needed. The addition of the DVD &quot;The Dog is Out&quot; made this purchase even more worthwhile. On the DVD X goes over his five albums, meets his grandfather for the first time, and has some live performances. Although most of the guest appearances are good on this, I would have liked to see some more tracks with X on solo, having six artists on &quot;Untouchable&quot; seems to many, though I like X and Sheeks lyrics. I would of also liked to see better track placement, as the album might have more continuity, and I have never been a fan of any skits. DMX's first two albums will always be by favourite ones, the next three are all keepers for me too though. &quot;Grand Champ&quot; is another solid album, recommend it for people who enjoy DMX's music like I do.

&quot;The Diary&quot; (1994) is one of Scarface's best albums. A short release at 13 tracks (including intro,interlude and outro), I first got this album almost ten years ago as a gift. Sometimes a short release pays off as this one does, the first thing that grabs me on this is the intro which was original to me at the time, and the way it ended in gunfire. Scarface comes through strong on the next track &quot;The White Sheet&quot;, I like the chorus to this track. &quot;No Tears&quot; is about looking for revenge on a friends killer. Face tells a story of murder on &quot;Jesse James&quot;. The only guest appearance comes from Ice Cube on &quot;Hand of the Dead Body&quot; a dope hardcore collabration track. I have two favourite tracks on this one, both exceptional classic Scarface tracks &quot;I Seen A Man Die&quot; and &quot;Mind Playin'Tricks&quot;. Both are excellent for there own reasons, both have Face exhibiting his premium dark storytelling skills. Scarface to me is definetly the best Southern solo rapper, and &quot;The Diary&quot; is an album for everyone who enjoys his music. People who are new to his music may want to start off with his best work of recent years &quot;The Fix&quot;.

Wyclef Jean's fourth solo album is &quot;The Preacher's Son&quot; (2003). First track I heard off this was &quot;Industry&quot; two months ago, when the video for it was being played, this track really impressed me, I liked how Wyclef dedicated it to everyone who loves Hip Hop, and remembered rappers, singers and the Princess who have died while talking about some of the current issues/events that have gone on, and are going on in Hip Hop. I also like the memorable chorus Wyclef sings on this one. Another single is going to be the party track &quot;Party to Damascus&quot; feat. Missy Elliot, fairly sure this is going to be one to blow up on the radio. &quot;Celebrate&quot; is my favorite track at the moment, Patti Labelle's appearance is excellent, making this a very memorable collabration and props to Wyclef for giving up and coming rapper Cassidy an appearance. &quot;Baby Daddy&quot; feat. Redman is about trying to be a father to another man's son, which is followed up by &quot;Three Nights In Rio&quot; feat. Carlos Santana. Another real standout for me is the deep &quot;Class Reunion&quot;, Wyclef and Monica singing duet is soulful and impressive. Clef experiments with his vocal tones on the slow &quot;Baby&quot;, and then the pace picks up &quot;I am Your Doctor&quot; feat. Wayne Wonder &amp; Elephant Man a track for the ladies, while &quot;Linda&quot; is about a woman on the warpath. Wyclef seems a happy man on tracks like the love ballad &quot;Take Me as I am&quot; and comes real on &quot;Grateful&quot;. Scarface and Rah Digga drop in for &quot;Next Generation&quot; another memorable collabration. &quot;Rebel Music&quot; is decent though I would of liked to see a longer appearance from Prodigy of Mobb Deep. Buja Banton drops in for next two tracks, which are followed up by the remix closer. Of these three the reggae based &quot;Who Gave the Order&quot; stands out the most. &quot;The Preacher's Son&quot;, is one of those chilled out albums full of diverse and refreshing music, that a wide variety of people who listen to different music genres can enjoy. Recommend this one for the collection.

The Roots delivered an excellent album with their 4th release "Things Fall Apart" (1999). The Philadelphia group at the time consisted of Black Thought, ?uestlove, Hub, Kamal and Malik B, Dice Raw, Rahzel who are no longer members. Listening to this album and its predecessor "Illadelph Halflife" it's clear to see why the Roots are heralded as one of Hip Hop's most innovative and unique groups -dope instrumentals and on point rhymes are found all throughout this release. The Grammy Award winning collaboration "You Got Me" feat. Erykah Badu & Eve is the most well known cut off this album, a deep love song which is simply off the hook - Black Thought shines on the MIC, and Badu's singing is outstanding. The Roots go without guest appearances on the early part of the album delivering some memorable cuts my favorites of these are "The Next Movement" & laidback "Dynamite". "Ain't Saying Nothin New" vibes well, another exceptional track has the Roots and Common collabing and paying tribute to Hip Hop on "Act Too (The Love of My Life)". Black Thought and Malik B tag team "100% Dundee", then collab with Dice Raw and Beanie Sigel for "Adrenaline". Black Thought is my favorite Roots MC, Malik B presence is missed on later releases, and I heard that he might be appearing on their next album, which is dropping later this year, hopefully that is true. "Things Fall Apart" is a great album for anyone who enjoys creative and quality Hip Hop.

Dr. Dre's (Andre Young) &quot;The Chronic&quot; (1992) is a classic West Coast Hip Hop album. Primarily a party album this one has been often imitated, never duplicated. My favourite track on this one has always been Dre &amp; Snoops collabration the now famous &quot;Nuthin' but a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot;. I enjoy every track on this release, some more favs for me include: Grammy award winner &quot;Let Me Ride&quot;, &quot;Lil Ghetto Boy&quot;, &amp; &quot;Stranded on Death Row&quot;. Snoop Dogg's appearances definetly helped make this a great album, back in 92 he was just another young cat on the rise, a year later he blew up. Dre delivered music to party to while not hesitating in getting controversial on tracks like &quot;Bitches Ain't S**t&quot;. This album appealed to both the mainstream audience and hip hop heads alike. Dr. Dre's excellent production, memorable lyrics, choice guest appearances and sick beats all helped make this a classic. &quot;The Chronic&quot; is an album I would recommend for any rap collection.

Chamillionaire delivers an impressive album with his major release debut "The Sound Of Revenge". Banging beats and on point lyricism leads to a entertaining album. A hungry sounding Chamillionaire opens up the album with a solid intro, hyping up his audience for whats to come. Houston's Chamillionaire delivers a outstanding banger with "In The Trunk", reppin the South with pride, while calling out the industry for being on Hovs ****, giving shoutouts - all the while rhyming with a addictive fast flow, and delivering his own chorus. Lil' Flip drops in for the next track, "Turn It Up" a club banger, while Krayzie Bone makes an appearance on "Ridin". Killer Mike & Pastor Troy collab with Chamillionaire for "Southern Takeover", all 3 MC's do well. The next track "Frontin" is dedicated to the fakes and haters and is laced with a nice beat. Chamillionaire switches things up by singing about the ladies on "Grown And Sexy" then hooks up with singer Natalie for "Think I'm Crazy". Another standout has Chamillionaire teaming up with Southern Legend Scarface and the talented Billy Cook for the deep "Rain". Chamillionaire delivers some heartfelt and real lyrics on "Void In My Life" while shining once again on the "Outro". I recommend Chamillionaire's "The Sound Of Revenge" for the collection.

Ambitious, progressive and experimental are a few words that come to my mind when describing Nas (AKA Nasir Jones) latest effort, the new double album "Street's Disciple" (2004). Running in at a total of twenty-five tracks, this has easily been one of the year's most anticipated Rap albums.Disc 1:Nas follows a strong intro up with "A Message to The Feds, Sincerely We The People", backed by a banging beat Nas rhymes with hunger addressing the Feds, while paying tribute to the streets, incarcerated and the oppressed. Nas reps himself with a fast flow on "Nazareth Savage", then hooks up with wife to be Kelis on the political "American Way" dropping some strong opinions. The beat to "These Are Our Heroes" is mellow, but the content is not, Nas rips up Kobe Bryant, fake rappers, snitches, bad role models while giving praise to people he thinks are good role models, the track ends on a humorous note. Nas rhymes with attitude on "Disciple". Nas then gives relatively unknown female MC Scarlett a chance to shine on "Sekou Story" and "Live Now". The first track of these is decent, while the later is outstanding, Nas pictures his last days, and reminds people to live for the moment. Nas then reflects on some of his life events with "Rest of My Life". Another excellent track and one of my favorites off this album is "Just A Moment", Nas & singer/rapper Quan deliver a very memorable collaboration. Emily provides a smooth chorus for "Reason" a track where Nas goes deep telling real life stories. Nas then closes off the first disc with "You Know My Style".Disc 2:The second disc opens up with the powerful "Suicide Bounce", Nas delivers some memorable lyrics while Busta Rhymes laces the track with an impressive chorus. This disc features a introspective maturing Nas, who is sharing more of himself then on past releases. In this sense its experimental to me, past fans may or may not like it, I enjoy the majority of it though. Nas collaborates with his father Olu Dara on two tracks on this disc the first of these is the title track "Streets Disciple". A whole generation of Rap listeners have grown up and missed one of the rap games greatest MCs- Rakim, Nas pays tribute to Rakim on "U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography of Rakim)". Ludacris and Doug E. Fresh drop in for the throwback like "Virgo". An intro with Kelis leads up to the explicit "Remember the Times" a track where Nas reflects on the past woman in his life, followed up "The Makings of A Perfect B****". Nas then talks about being happy about his upcoming marriage to Kelis on "Getting Married". "No One Else in The Room" is upbeat dance track, which features R & B singer Maxwell, a track for Kelis. The single "Bridging the Gap" follows, its sort of groundbreaking in that its the first time a rapper and his father have hooked up to deliver a commercial single, while Olu Dara has had presence since Illmatic, the two of them have never collaborated like this. This track has grown on me. On "War" Nas reflects on his growth and family while Keon Bryce sings a soulful chorus. "Me & You (Dedicated to Destiny)" is a real deep track, which Nas created for his daughter, the genuine love he has as a parent shines through. The bonus track and banging single "Thief's Theme" finishes the album on a good note.Nas has lived up to this reviewer's expectations with "Street's Disciple" delivering an album to remember. Nas got innovative with this album, and more personal. Collectively the album flows well. The young man, who released the classic "Illmatic" ten+ years ago, is a grown man now progressing in life and music. Whether people will give him the credit he deserves remains to be seen. Highly recommend "Street's Disciple" for the collection.

Warren G's (Warren Griffin III) 3rd album "I Want It All" (1999) marks the return of a creative Rapper/Producer who is best known for his debut album the triple platinum "Regulate...G Funk Era". Coming across this album was a nice surprise, I had missed his 2nd album and really not heard anything new from Warren G in five years. This release runs in at 16 tracks (including intro/outro and a remix) and is executive produced by Warren G. Guest appearances are numerous and come from: Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, Nate Dogg, RBX, Crucial Conflict, Mack 10, Jermaine Dupri, Snoop Dogg, Phats Bossi, Reel Tight, El Debarge, Val Young, Eve, Drag-on, Shadow, Neb Love, K-Bar, Slick Rick, Memphis Bleek & Tikki Diamond. Warren G looks after the majority of the production on this album(13/16 tracks), while Priest does "My Mamma (Ola Mae)", and Vada Nables does "We Got That" and "I Want It All (Remix). After a short intro the album starts with "Gangsta Love" feat. Kurupt, Nate Dogg & RBX, a track laced with a laid back beat, some nice verses, and a tight chorus by Nate Dogg. "Why Oh Why" feat. Daz & Kurupt flows well and is followed up by the standout "Dollars Make Sense" feat. Kurupt & Crucial Conflict. Warren G & Mack drop a g-funk collabration to remember on the albums lead single/title track. "Havin' Things" feat. J. Dupri and Nate Dogg, flows nicely, though in my opinion there was no need to add J. Dupri on it. "You Never Know" feat. Snoop Dogg, Phats Bossi, Reel Tight is about death & living life to the fullest, Snoops appearance is a good one, Warren shines, and I really like the outstanding soulful background R & B chorus. Warren G drops a deep dedication track with "My Momma" (Ola Mae) a track for his mums who passed away. "G-Spot" feat. El Debarge and Val Young is a nice Rap/R&B collab about the ladies. Ruff Ryders Eve & Drag-on as well as Shadow drop in for "We Got That" and though the track is not bad it seems a bit misplaced for this album, guess its about Warren G showing love for the East Coast. Warren G goe solo on "Dope Beat" a track where he talks about the game and mentions other MC's like Jay-Z. Relaxed "World Wide Ryders" feat. Neb Love & K-Bar of 5 Footaz runs smoothly. Warren goes back to his roots uniting with 213 members Snoop and Nate on "Game Don't Wait" a track that makes me look forward to there 213 album which is supposed to be dropping sometime in the next year. Oldschool UK rapper Slick Rick makes a nice appearance on "If We Give You a Chance". I thought Vada Nobles produced "I Want It All" (Remix) feat. Memphis Bleek, Drag-On & Tikki Diamond, was going to be a filler track instead it turned out to be a decent closing joint. Warren G's "I Want It All" has got an upbeat relaxed vibe all throughout, lots of good guest appearances and some tight production making it a album to enjoy.

Big Boi, one half of the legendary Outkast delivers an impressive release with "Got Purp? Vol. 2" (2005). While Andre has hit the acting scene, Big Boi has created a label with a roster full of talent. The lead single "Kryptonite" (I'm On It) is off the hook, Big Boi, C-Bone, Rock D and Killer Mike provide a track to remember - its no surprise that this one is becoming a club anthem. Singer Sleepy Brown shines on solo delivering the smooth "Me, My Baby And My Cadillac" while Killer Mike leads the way on the banging "Body Rock" feat. Lil Co & Donkee Boy. Young singer Scar holds his own on the upbeat "U Got Me". Bubba Sparxxx, Cool Breeze and Killer Mike then take their audience to the "Claremont Lounge". Goodie Mob's "Hold On" is excellent reality rap, love the lyrics and beat to this cut. Scar and Cee-Lo provide a laidback track for the late night with "What Is This". Konkrete deliver the albums last standout for me with "Lovin This", feeling the lyrics, hook and beat to this one. Purple Ribbon has a label full of established artists and newcomers with a lot of potential, looking forward to future releases, Big Boi has succeeded once again. This is not a release to be slept on.

Ali Vegas Mixtape "The Rebirth of A Prince" (2004) - Hosted By DJ Big Mike, is one of my favorite underground releases. Ali Vegas in my opinion remains one of the Rap Game's most slept on and talented MC's. I am looking forward to the day he gets an official studio album out, hopefully his latest venture with his own record label Rich Soil Entertainment pays off. South Jamaica, Queens, New York city MC Vegas has a wealth of Mixtapes and an unreleased album called "Generation Gap". His newest Mixtape is "Wait Till They Get A Load Of Me" (2006) Hosted by Super Star Jay. This Mixtape remains my overall favorite - Vegas delivers the good's with on point freestyles and outstanding full length tracks like "Rags To Riches", "Problems", "My Life" feat. Leeia, "Feel Like A King" and "Nuthin But Gangsta". These tracks's never grow old on me, and will continue to get play for many years to come.1. Intro2. Words From Prince3. Victory Feat. Pbs4.

Akon's debut album &quot;Trouble&quot; (2004) is decent. As an artist he brings something different with a somewhat unique voice that can catch your attention. The first track &quot;Locked Up&quot; has a soulful Akon telling a story of being in jail and wanting to get out and move on, I am sure some people who have strayed on the wrong paths in there life can relate with this one. Akon addresses the life of a convict who is trying to make it on the title track &quot;Trouble&quot;. Not much into, &quot;Bananaz&quot; (Belly Dancer) a track about the ladies, find it bland, also feel same way about the next one. Akon drops a standout sad sounding cut with &quot;Ghetto&quot; a track about dealing with self destructive street life and finding a better way. &quot;Pot of Gold&quot; is an upbeat track, where Akon talks about being strong and overcoming lifes obstacles. &quot;Lonely&quot; is about losing a special girl and wanting to get her back, the background sample is funny. Akon travels on &quot;Journey&quot;, which is followed up by the relaxed &quot;Dont Let Up&quot;. The album closes off with the bonus track &quot;Locked Up&quot; (Remix) feat. Styles P of the Lox. This is actually the track that drew my attention to this album, like this collabration. Akon to me is clearly a R &amp; B singer even though this album has been mislabeled as a Rap album. The difference with him is he talks about some topics your average singer does not and brings a different sound while handling the majority of production himself. That said theres alot of tracks I skip over, but a few do standout making &quot;Trouble&quot; an album I recommend checking out. I think R &amp; B fans will appreciate it more then Rap fans.

Detroit rapper Proof (AKA Deshaun Holton) died early this morning in a club shooting. May he Rest in Peace. One of the main members of D12 Proof, played a big role in the Detroit Hip-Hop movement and was respected freestyle MC. While I checked out Proof's second album "Searching For Jerry Garcia" (2005) last year I never got around to reviewing it. This was his first commercial album; prior to this he had an EP and his debut album "I Miss the Hip Hop Shop" (2004). After the intro the album opens with "Clap With Me", Proof rhymes backed by some upbeat production and a nice sample. The next standout track is "Forgive Me", Proof rhymes about his dysfunctional upbringing and talks about his life past and present, backed by a familiar 50 Cent hook (Ghetto Quran). B.R. Gunna produced "Purple Gang" & "Gurls Wit Da Boomis" are club party type tracks. Cypress Hill's B-Real and the Wu-Tang's Method Man drop in for the solid collabration cut "High Rollers". A number of experimental tracks follow, and then Obie Trice and J-Hill team up with Proof for the thugged out "72nd & Central", dropping rules on a track about Detroit's grimy street life. Proof, singer Nate Dogg and D-12's Swifty Mcvay then talk about snitches on "Sammy Da Bull", a track which is named after John Gotti's former underboss Sammy "Da Bull" Gravano. The album's closer is the outstanding "Kurt Kobain", Proof puts his heart into this deep cut, reflecting on his life backed by some tight production from Emile. Proof's lyrics on this cut are especially hard hitting today, "Sometimes I wish for my demise, so I can kick it with Bugs I wish it was real between us all In the past, you should of seen us dawg I die for Em and save Haley, brave maybe But just let them tears remove my grave Shady". Another sad day for Hip-Hop. R.I.P. Proof.

Terror Squad's first and only album is a gem worth having in the collection. Terror Squad at the time consisted of rappers Fat Joe, Big Punisher, Cuban Link, Prospect, Armageddon and Triple Seis. This release came out in 1999, and since then Big Pun has died (R.I.P.), and the squad has split up with some members going different routes (Cuban Link starting his own label CLK Entertainment, and Triple Seis has left as well). Fat Joe continues to lead Terror Squad but its a much different group, and so far the only music out from it in the last four years has been Fat Joe solo albums. TS member and R & B singer Tony Sunshine is also featured on this release, and drops some nice vocals and chorus'. Fat Joe, Rob Tewlow, Greg Angelides & Craig Kallman handle executive producion. Alot of the beats on this are excellent with production coming from the likes of Alchemist, Buckwild, Young Lord, Jugrnaut & Yogi. Albums first track is the piano laced "In For Life" a powerful thugged out track where the TS comes out raw. "Pass the Glock" features all six members in a deadly collabration. Fastpaced "99 Live" has Prospect leading and is banging. Big Pun comes across very nicely solo on "Whatcha Gon Do?". Triple Seis comes out hard on "War" then Fat Joe tears it up on "Bring It On". My favourite track is without a doubt "As the World Turns" a track where Cuban Link absolutely shines and one where Tony Sunshine drops an exceptional chorus. This track opened my eyes to CL's lyrical ability, and now with his half brother Pun gone he is in my opinion the best latin hip hop rapper out. A hungry Armageddon comes out nicely on "Gimme Dat". "All Around the World" has Cuban talking about the ladies, drugs and street life. "Tell Me What U Want" is a laid back R & Bish track. Buja Banton drops in for "Rudeboy Salute" and having never heard Banton before I was surprised by his vocal tones. The Mellow "My Kinda Girls" has CL & Tony Sunshine talking about a hot lady, on a humourus track. Keith Nut & Armagageddon drop a decent collab on "Paying Dues" and "www.Thatsmysh-T.com" closes this sixteen track album off. Big Pun and Fat Joe keep there appearances limited as there goal I think was to showcase the skills of the lesser known MCs in the group. Of these MC's Cuban Link stands out the most for me, followed up by Prospect, then Armageddon and Triple Seis, all of them deserve to be on this release.Highly recommend this release for those who like latin Hip Hop, there will probably never be another Terror Squad album, and if there is it most definitely will not be like this one.

Tupac Shakurs fifth post death album "Until The End of Time" is excellent. Executive producers Suge Knight and Afeni Shakur really got the production formula right on this one in 2001. Track production comes from Johnny J, QD3, LT Hutton, M.Mosley, Big Simon, T. Wrice, K Coulthon, Cold187um and DJ Quik. Guest appearances include: SkG, Big Syke, Outlawz, KC & Jojo, R.L., Lil Mo, Thug Life, Above the Law, Left_Eye (R.I.P.), J. Valentine and Richard Page. Music comes from the time period 1994-1996 and this is the first of two double albums, the second which was released just recently is "Better Dayz". Album consists of 28 tracks. Disc One starts with "Ballad of Dead Soulja" and Pac comes out furious, background beats and vocals are sick. "F*** Friends" continues this hardcore pace set by the first track, and Pac talks about women and calls out Jay-Z. "Lil Homies" comes next and Pac talks about broken homes and shattered dreams, and the result a misled youth who is ready to take on the world. "Let Em Have it" feat. SKG is a track about the ladies,sex, and partying, and is a more upbeat track. "Good Life" and "Breathin" are hardcore bangers where Pac talks about enemies, making money and surviving in the game. "Letter to My Unborn Child" is one of the deepest tracks, inspirational as Pac goes deep talking about life, god, and writes to future children who he feels he may never see. "Happy Home" is a beautiful track dedicated by Pac to his half sister Sekyiwa Kai. Track is about love, children, family and the good life. "F***** with the Wrong N***a" is another track where Pac talks about riding on his enemies, cept its got a very mellow background beat, that is addictive to listen to. Next comes the title track and lead single "Until The end of Time" feat. R.L , very nice track where Pac flows classic verse after verse. "My Closest Roaddoggz" starts off disc two, and is a nice strong start track. "N***** Nature" (Remix) feat. Lil Mo is a track about the ladies, party life, sex, has got a positive upbeat feel to it. On "When Thugz Cry" Pac comes out dark while talking about lost friends, lost souls, and the downfall of the community. Tracks that follow continue this dark pace, and Tupac's flow is deadly on them. Outlawz appear on eight tracks in this album and one of the tracks where they come out strongest is "Lastoneleft". "When I get Free" and "Until the End of Time" (Remix) close the album off powerfully. Of all Tupac's post-death albums this album really stands out as it brings back the Tupac many of us came to know and love. Another classic album from one of raps legendary mcs, who no longer lives with us in physical form but always in memory.

Jadakiss 2001 release "Kiss tha Game Goodbye" is a good album, not a classic, but not an album to ignore either. The album starts off with "Jadas Got a Gun" which has a dope beat, the next track "Show Discipline" is a harcore track featuring Nas, "Knock Yourself Out" then comes a track for the ladies. Next track Jada and Styles drop a lox track to be remembered in "We gonna Make it" still loving this track a year later. What follows is a few forgettable/average tracks and then "Kiss is Spittin" featuring Nate Dog. This track is my favourite on the album, just a chill track, with a dope beat, loving cruising to it. DMX drops in for "Un-Huhn", another hardcore track. The final track "Keep your Head up" ends the album on a positive note, and leaves the listner waiting for more. I see two things holding Jada back from dropping Classic albums, one being, his featuring too many guests on his albums, sure Nas and DMX and Nate Dog are nice, but Dragon, Fiend, Yung Wun add little, if not taking away from the album. The other being Jadas choice of lyrics, his flow is crazy nice even addictive, his tone is good, but sometimes his lyrics just stray right off, and make him sound like just another average NY MC. Regardless Jada still comes out strong solo, and if you love the lox, you will enjoy this album.

In December of 1998, DMX (Earl Simmons) dropped his second album &quot;Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood&quot;, just eight months after his first release. You might think that such a quick release would result in a weak album, but instead in this album we get another Hiphop Classic. Intro track &quot;My N....s&quot; starts the album off powerfully, and sets the tone for whats to come, one of the best intros I have ever heard. &quot;Bring your Whole Crew&quot; is a hardcore banger, followed by the Swizz Beats produced &quot;Ain't No Way&quot; another banger, X comes across rugged and memorable on both of these. Guest appearances are nice on this album. Jadakiss of the Lox drops in for &quot;We Don't Give a f..k&quot; and this is followed by another sick track &quot;Keep Your S..t The Hardest&quot;. R &amp; B queen Mary J Blige drops in for &quot;Coming From&quot;. DMX talks about the ladies in &quot;Its All the Good&quot;. The best track on this album and my all time favourite DMX track &quot;Slippin&quot; comes next. DMX goes deep on this one, talking about growing up, becoming a man, and making it through the hardest of times, thug life, hitting rock bottom, while repping hook &quot;I am slipping, I am falling, I cant get up..&quot;, as well as thanking the people who helped him make it. Message in this track is no matter how far you go down, you can always make it back. More memorable banging tracks follow like &quot;No Love 4 Me&quot; ,&quot;Dogs for Life&quot;, and &quot;Blackout&quot;. Album ends with &quot;Ready to Meet him&quot; a prayer. &quot;Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood&quot; is excellent from start to finish, classic album for anyone who loves hiphop.

G-Unit's &quot;Beg For Mercy&quot; (2003) is a solid eighteen track album. G-Unit consists of long time friends 50 Cent, Llyod Banks, Tony Yayo and a fourth newer member Young Buck. Yayo's contribution on this one is limited to two tracks, as he is currently locked up. By now everyone knows 50 Cent, this album is really about introducing his crew to the mainstream audience. G-Unit has come a long way, from working there way up in the mixtape circuit to now reaching the forefront of mainstream hip hop. Executive Produced by 50 Cent &amp; Sha Money XL, track production comes from: Hi-Tek, Dr. Dre, Scott Scorch, Thayod Ausar, DJ Twinz, Denaun Porter,Eminem, Luis Resto, Red Spyda, Dirty Swift, Bruce Wayne, Fusion Untld., Nottz, No I.D., Megahertz, 7th EMP, Black Jeruz, Khali, Needlez and Sam Sneed. A number of samples are used throughout the album, and Joe, Butch Cassidy each make an appearance. &quot;g-unit&quot; intro starts things off, and is followed by the exceptional single &quot;poppin'them thangs&quot;, 50's addictive chorus, solid lyrics and great production courtesy of Dr. Dre &amp; Scott Scorch make this a track to remember. Next track is &quot;my buddy&quot; which samples from the movie Scarface, G-Unit drops some good verses, and 50 sings well on this one and &quot;i'm so hood&quot;. Lead single &quot;Stunt 101&quot; follows, a track where G-Unit reps there new found wealth and success. The album's first laid back track is the nice &quot;wanna get to know you&quot; feat. R &amp; B singer Joe who drops a soulful chorus as G-Unit talks to the ladies. Next couple of tracks are average for me then, Hi-Tek produced &quot;eye for an eye&quot; picks up the pace. Another standout for me is the No I.D. produced &quot;smile&quot;, backed by a chilled out beat Lloyd and 50 talk to their women. This is just one of those love based cuts to play with your lady, and in my opinion would of been a better choice for a single then the next track &quot;baby u got&quot;. G-Unit talks about their loyalty to each other on the short &quot;salute u&quot; and drops some indirect disses on the title track. Have to say the two tracks Dr. Dre produces on this are my favorites, the second of these is &quot;g'd up&quot; a hardcore track which G-Unit rips up. G-Unit talks about other rappers, the game and the media on &quot;lay you down&quot;, and come hard on the fastpaced &quot;gangsta s***&quot;, found that both these tracks got better with more rotation. &quot;i smell p****&quot; closes off the album with all four members on the track, starts by tearing into Murder Inc members, and leads into G-Unit talking about a lady. Like most new releases today I found that this album had a few cuts that fall under skip material for me, though they are a minority. Thankfully there are no skits, which are found all too often nowadays and really hold little value after the initial listen. Solo projects are planned for each of the members, of these Llyod Banks album is getting the most hyped and is the one I am looking forward to. The software on the disc which allows buyers to watch videos, get updates and go behind the scenes is a nice bonus. Overall &quot;Beg For Mercy&quot; is a impressive release, which I recommend for the collection. One.

Tru's debut album "True" (1995) opened some eyes back in the day when No Limit was just another unknown record label to many of us. While Master P had been in the game for a number of years, he combined forces with his brothers Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder and collectively they would release three group albums as Tru. This was the first No Limit release I came across. Executive produced by Master P, guest appearances come from Mia X, King George, Mo. B Dick, Tobin "TC" Costen, Big Ed, Uhuru Wright and C-Bo. After the intro, hardcore "Last Dance" feat. Mia X starts things off, a track where Tru talk about murder, drugs and life and death. "That's How We Break Bread" feat. C-Bo is laced with a killer beat. Tru talk about the hustling life on "Living that Life" and "Another Day, Another Dollar" has a laid back beat and is about getting money. "I'm Bout' It, Bout It" is that track that blew up and made people pay attention to Tru, laced with a sick background beat, this is one of those cuts that became an anthem. My favourite track on this album is "Ain't No Glock" a track where C-Murder excels and P drops a nice chorus over an addictive beat. "Would You Take a Bullet for Your Homie" feat. Big Ed is anothers standout track about loyalty and death. The second to last track "Keep It All Good" is a nice feel good track to bump. The album ends with Tru giving shoutouts to fam, friends, industry peoples and God. I enjoyed alot of the production on this release, and while Tru's lyrical content is limited and there is some skip material, overall they came out well on "True" delivering some real standout cuts that still play well many years later.

Almost a decade ago rap legend The Notorious B.I.G. (Christopher Wallace) dropped a Hip Hop classic with &quot;Ready to Die&quot;. Biggie was a very talented, versatile Rapper who brought the East back into the limelight with this release and whos influence still exists today (Just look at the rappers who have followed in his footsteps). The remastered version (2004) features two first class bonus tracks in &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; and &quot;Just Playing&quot; (Dreams). The DVD contains the Notorious music videos for this album (Big Poppa, Juicy, Warning, One More Chance) and a live performance of &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. This album is a masterpiece that should be in every Rap collection, full of tracks that became anthems to a whole generation. I have listened to thousands and thousands of songs and have many favourites but &quot;Juicy&quot; is without a doubt my all time favourite Rap track. One thing I like about this being rereleased, is that hopefully a whole new generation of Rap fans will pick this up and appreciate. One Love

Brother Ali's "Shadow On The Sun" was one of the most slept on albums of 2003. I was guilty of sleeping on this album to, only picked it up recently and have been very impressed. After hearing the opening track "Room with a View" I knew I was listening to something special. Brother Ali is a skilled lyricist and Ant delivers premium production throughout this album, there musical chemistry together is exceptional. Brother Ali backed by some sick beats, lets it be known that he will take on all contenders with early tracks "Champion" and "Star Quality". Next comes "Prince Charming" a relaxed track where Ali talks to a honey, while singing his own chorus. Brother Ali rhymes about getting jumped on "Win Some Lose Some", and tears into fake rappers who don't pay tribute to the founders on "Pay Them Back". Slug and Ali drop a decent collabration with "Blah Blah Blah" and then Brother Ali rips up the title track "Shadows On The Sun". Brother Ali's entertaining introspective lyrics are found all throughout this release, upbeat "Forest Whitaker" is an especially good example, a track where Ali discusses personal appearances, addresses being an Albino, and talks about saying what one feels without holding back and being happy with who one is. (...) Brother Ali does not hesitate to show his scorn for some other rappers on battle tracks (...) "When The Beat Comes". With "Dorian" Brother Ali tells a story of taking on a wife beater, my favourite line in this track "It seemed that he invited my right fist to a party on his left cheek". Brother Ali goes deep when talking about the pains of growing up and being the black sheep of his family on "Picket Fence". This release ends strong with the powerful "Victory! (Come Forward)" a raw track where Brother Ali delivers alot of hunger and confidence. Highly recommend "Shadows On The Sun" for the collection.

Infinite &quot;360&quot; is the first album dropped by Infinite aka Dale Francis. Its short, however every track on the album is classic.360 Degrees is a wicked track about a killer, the beat is just sick. Its also included as a instrumental at the end of the album, have to say I keep replaying it over and over. &quot;Take a look&quot; has Infinite introducing you to his world, as he drops a wicked narrative. &quot;Wise Guys&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get Mine&quot; follow they all have the quality of 360. The production on this album, is crazy nice, the beats are ill, but its really Infinite who makes the album, hes got nice lyrics, nice flow, and his sound is addictive. After that its mixes and instrumentals, their good. Sure 5 tracks is short, but ill take quality over quantity any day. Its been a few years now, and its rumoured his next album is coming out soon, if you havnt heard this one you really have been sleeping. Infinite can also be found on collab tracks with Maestro &quot;We came Wid It&quot; and with Tragedy and Capone on &quot;98 Thug Paradise&quot;. Infinite is without a doubt Canadas best rap artist, and just wait till he comes out on U.S. Scene. 360 Degrees an essential album to have.

Nas &quot;Illmatic&quot; is a classic. One of those cds that you can pop in years later, and enjoy like you just got it. All of the ten tracks on the album shine in what is definetly one of the best hiphop albums ever released. &quot;N.Y. State of Mind&quot; produced by DJ Premier has crazy beats, with piano tinges, and is a killer start to album. Next Nas and AZ collabrated on &quot;Life's a Bitch&quot; one of the illest collabs ever to come out. Next track is &quot;This World is Yours&quot; (Pete Rock produced), has Nas dropping Raw Lyrics, with crazy background beat. &quot;Halftime&quot; follows then another Primo track &quot;Memory Lane&quot; has Nas reminescining on growing up. &quot;One Love&quot; has Nas giving shouts out to lost/Jailedfriends. The album finishes with &quot;One Time 4 your Mind&quot; (Large Professer&quot;, &quot;Represent&quot; (Primo) amd my favourite track off the album &quot;It aint hard to tell&quot; has Nas dropping lyrics to Jazzed up version of &quot;Human Nature&quot; by michael jackson. Illmatic is truly one of the best hiphop albums ever to come out, as a young Nas spits mad poetry, and keeps his listner addicted throughout. An album for every Rap Collection.

Canada's own K-OS (A.K.A. Kevin Brereton, Knowledge of Self) returns with his third solo album "Atlantis: Hymns for Disco" (2006). The award winning rapper, singer, songwriter and producer provides a thirteen track (+ 1 Bonus) release which has guest appearances from Sam Roberts, Kevin Drew & Buck 65. This album came out in October in Canada and will be on sale globally Febuary 2007. My favourite track on this release is the powerful "The Rain" an exceptional joint where K-Os takes his singing to new levels. Another off the hook track is the feel good single "Sunday Morning". The album's biggest collabration has K-OS teaming up with Kevin Drew and Sam Roberts on the fast paced "Valhalla". K-OS sings more on this album then either of his previous releases, on the distinct "CatDiesel" he drops the occasional rhyme. The upbeat "Black-Ice- Hymn For Disco" follows, feeling K-OS melodic chorus on this cut, which is followed up by Slick Rick sounding rhymes. K-OS slows things down for "Highway 7", soulfully singing to God. "Ballad of Noah" has K-OS collabing with fellow Canadian artist Buck 65 for another memorable track. K-OS delivers another great album with "Atlantis: Hymns For Disco" - substantial music that vibes well, don't sleep.

After a three-year hiatus DMX (Earl Simmons) returns with "Year of the Dog...Again" (2006). At thirty-six years old, Yonker's DMX is an established veteran in the Rap game delivering his sixth solo album. As X likes to remind his listeners the previous five (It's Dark and Hell Is Hot-Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood-And Then There Was X-The Great Depression-Grand Champ) went platinum/multi platinum, and I have no doubt this one will to. In the last couple of years DMX has been fighting some battles, whether it be with the law, record companies, or other issues. Being a long time fan I am really happy to see him back making music again. After the short intro DMX and long time collaborator producer Swizz Beatz deliver a fast paced banger with "We In Here", X rhymes with hunger and pride while repping himself and talking about the state of the game. DMX then provides "I Run S***" letting it be known that he's back and not going anywhere, Bloodline's Big Stan makes a brief appearance. With "Come Thru" (Move) X and Busta Rhymes deliver another track to blast in the whip. DMX's Ruff Ryders brethren Jadakiss and Styles P of the Lox drop in for "It's Personal", all three come on point delivering raw thugged out lyrics. X then flips the script providing a different kind of track with "Baby Motha", rhyming about relationships, loving X's own chorus to this one. "Dog Love" is a joint strictly for the ladies, R & B singers Janyce & Amerie collab with X on a laidback cut. X gives Bloodlines Rock act Bazaar Royale a chance to make an impression on "Wrong or Right" (I'm Tired) - I am not really impressed. The only other track I feel the same way about on this release is "Walk These Dogs" feat. Kashmir, just not feeling it. DMX delivers another quality banger with the single "Give Em' What They Want" rhyming over some blazing Scott Scorch production. My favorite track on this release at the moment is "Blown Away" an exceptional cut where DMX shines while taking his listeners through his early life, singer Janyce deliver smooth background vocals and MC Jinx makes a late appearance. A reflective DMX rhymes and sings on the outstanding "Goodbye" reminding his audience that any day can be our last, while remembering friends who died to young. X continues the introspective journey and provides another excellent cut with "Life Be My Song" - sometimes our worst enemy can be ourselves, DMX's lyrics and chorus are hard hitting and relate to many people on some level. For every album DMX had done he has made a prayer, he keeps the tradition going with "The Prayer VI", and follows it up with the single "Lord Give Me A Sign", loved this cut since the first day I heard it a few months ago, X delivers memorable lyrics and an outstanding chorus while talking to God. X keep his album diverse ranging from cuts to blast in the ride, to deep introspective joints that make you think. DMX delivers another quality album with "Year of the Dog...Again" this a release I highly recommend adding to the collection.

English Singer and Songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's self titled debut album "Corinne Bailey Rae" (2006) is a memorable twelve track release full of feel good music. Corrine Bailey Rae is a gifted singer who's soulful singing, and beautiful personality shine through on this release. In addition to singing Bailey Rae plays the acoustic, electric and spanish guitar, percussion, bass, piano and keyboards. Not to be forgotten is group of background personnel who provide some exceptional and outstanding instrumentals and production. My personal favourites on this release are: "Call Me When You Get This", "Like A Star", "Enchantment" and "Butterfly". Bailey Rae takes her audience through an enjoyable journey on this album, covering many different aspects of life and love. "Corrine Bailey Rae" is an international release I recommend to anyone who enjoy's quality music.

John Legend's "Get Lifted" is one of 2004's last major releases. Legend (Aka John Stephens) originally of Ohio is a gifted artist, who got his chance to shine commercially courtesy of Kayne West. Like another reviewer I first learned of John Legend when I heard his impressive chorus on Talib Kweli's "Around My Way". After the prelude Legend takes his audience to another place with the smooth "Let's Get Lifted". The album's impressive lead single "Used to Love You" follows. Kayne West makes an appearance on the upbeat "Number One", while Snoop Dogg drops in for memorable "I Can Change". My favourite track is "Stay With You", Legend sings a beautiful story of everlasting love with the end result being an excellent track. Two more of my favourites include the outstanding "So High" and "Refuge" (When It's Cold Outside). "Live It Up" with violist Miri Ben Ari closes the album off well. John Legend's "Get Lifted" is the kind of release, which appeals to a wide variety of different types of music listeners, I recommend checking this one out.

The Geto Boys (Bushwick Bill, Scarface, Willie D) return with their latest offering "The Foundation" (2005). At fifteen tracks long (including intro/outro) this is a relatively short release. GB start the album off strong, getting grimy on "Declaration of War". This is followed up by the albums lead single the banging "Yes Yes Y'all" which all three members shining. Another standout has the Geto Boys lighting up "When It Gets Gangsta" with some thugged out lyrics. The Geto Boys take things to another level with the outstanding "I Tried", a sentimental track, which have the trio analyzing life, and the struggles they have gone through. My favorite track at the moment is "G Code", love the beat and lyrics to this cut. More reflection follows on the laidback "Leaning on You" a track which have the Geto Boys opening up, giving praise to god with the end result being another impressive track. More grimy tales follow on cuts like "Nothin' to Show" and "Real N**** S***". "In The End" The Geto Boys recommend the secret of winning is to find a way out of the game. Bushwick Bill does well on solo with "Dirty B****", telling a story of love and betrayal. I can honestly say I am really happy to see the Geto Boys back at it, "The Foundation" is a definite pickup for fans of the group.

The Roots (Black Thought,Malik B., Hub, ?uestlove,Rahzel,Kamal) third album "Illadelph Halflife" (1996) is one of those good albums that is bound to be slept on. My introduction to Philadelphia's best came on there 2nd release "Do You Want More?!!.." an album I got from a friend on my birthday. I really enjoyed that album as I enjoy this one, though I missed out on "Illadeph Halflife" when it dropped originally (in my defense 96 was a year with a lot of good music, making it easy to miss out on some albums). Executive produced by Richard Nicholas this comes through as an eighteen track release excluding intro/outro that is. Guest appearances come from the likes of Common Sense, Dice Raw, with vocals from several performers notably Raphael Saadiq & D'Angelo. "Respond/React" gets things started with a lyrical barrage, a strong track. This is followed up by tracks like "Section" a more mellow low key track with a dope beat and "Panic!!!!" a track about street life and the ominous sounding "It Just Don't Stop". Track eight "What they Do" is my favourite joint on this release, a very impressive soulful combination of R&B/Hip Hop which runs at just under six minutes. Roots sound a bit crazy on "Concerto of Desparado" which is followed up by albums lead single "Clones" which has Roots coming out hard while representing themselves and talking about wack MC's. "Universe at War" features Common, and is a decent collabration track. "No Alibi" is another standout track I like. Laid back tracks like "No Great Pretender" and "The Hypnotic" follow and are enhanced by some nice smooth background vocals. Last standout track for me is "One Shine" an impressive jazzed up track, which features no lyricism, instead sampling a variety of intrumentals and vocals. The Roots "Illadelph Halflife" is another solid album from a Hiphop group that even now continues to be underated and slept on, highly recommend checking out this album it does not disappoint.

First time I heard M.O.P. was on there second album "Firing Squad" (1996). The duo of Lil'Fame & Billy Danzenie delivered a solid album full of hardcore tracks. DJ Premier and Big Jaz's production contributions to this album are memorable. Backed by a sick piano beat, M.O.P. rip up the grimey title track "Firing Squad", followed up by the deadly "New Jack City". Next Rap legend Kool G Rap drops in for a rugged collabration on "Stick To Ya Gunz" another sick track. "Anticipation" embodies part of KRS-One's "MC's Act Like They Know" and is another blazing track. M.O.P. represent on "Born to Kill" love the keyboards to this one. Big Jaz's beat to "World Famous" was reused last year on Scarface's hit single "My Block", its a sick beat and I like the M.O.P. version. On "Lifestyles of a Ghetto Child" and "Illside of Town" M.O.P. deliver dark hardcore tracks of Murder, loyalty and survival. The next cut "Nothin 2 Lose" is outstanding, M.O.P. get more personal talking about themselves, fallen friends and family, jail and the streets. "Dead & Gone" is another standout, sampling portions of Curtis Mayfields "Let's Do It Again" and featuring background vocals from Battle, Tanya Ray and La Shonda Middleton, M.O.P. pay tribute to fallen friends while addressing death and the afterlife. Album closes off well with "Born 2 Kill" (Jazz Mix). M.O.P. deliver genuine grimey streetlife music with "Firing Squad" an album I would recommend to anyone who enjoy hardcore Hip Hop.

Bad Boys II Soundtrack drops three days prior to the movie. I remember enjoying the first movie's action packed sequences, and finding Will Smith and Martin Lawerence an entertaining duo, so I am looking forward to going to the movie in a few days, as for the soundtrack its decent. Soundtrack comes out on P. Diddy's Bad Boy Records, it makes sense for Bad Boy Records to deliver this soundtrack which shares the labels name. Sean Combs (P. Diddy) executive produces this release. After a short intro from the movies co-stars, the first track is the Neptunes produced &quot;Show me Your Soul&quot; feat. P.Diddy, Lenny Kravitz, Pharrell Williams and Loon, a unique collaboration. Jay-Z comes out solo on the next track &quot;La, La, La&quot; a track with a nice beat which is the first of two tracks that has been made into a video. The second being &quot;Shake Ya Tailfeather&quot; feat. P. Diddy and the St. Lunatics Nelly and Murphy Lee drop an upbeat party track, not huge into this one, though its going to be one of those tracks that blows up on the radio. &quot;Girl I'm a Bad Boy&quot; feat. Fat Joe, P. Diddy and Dre is a hot Rap/R&amp;B song, Dre's vocals are very impressive, and Diddy &amp; Fat Joe come out well. Destiny's Child Beyonce delivers a strong soulful performance on the upbeat &quot;Keep Giving your Love to Me&quot;. The &quot;Realest ...&quot; has this years most popular artist (50 Cent) and the late great Notorious B.I.G. toghether. On one hand its nice to hear the Notorious on the other, just reminds me what a great rapper the hiphop world lost in 1997. Rocafella's Freeway comes through on &quot;Flipside&quot; a fast-paced track. My favorite track is called &quot;Gangsta ...&quot; feat. Snoop Dogg and Bad Boy Records artist Loon. Snoop is usually always good at collab tracks, this track being a fine example of that, Loon is memorable as well.&quot;Pretty Girl Bullshit&quot; feat. Mario Winans and Foxy Brown falls under skip material for me. Next comes the first of in my opinion three pointless interludes, combined with the albums intro, this makes "Bad Boys II soundtrack a fourteen track work. So what do you do when you want a soundtrack to have even more mainstream popularity? You get teenage heartthrob Justin Timberlake on your soundtrack. Timberlake does a good job on &quot;Love Don't Love Me&quot; a catchy song about a girl he is infatuated with. Loon who has three appearances on the soundtrack leads on &quot;Relax your Mind&quot; a laid back track where Loon talks about his rise in the game, which has Diddy repping Bad Boy in the background. The next track &quot;Didn't Mean" comes courtesy of R &amp; B Queen Mary J. Blige, like the beat and Bliges vocals. Da Band a collection of artists from Sean Combs MTV show &quot;Making the Band 2&quot; are next on &quot;Why&quot; a song about the devil and player hating. Not big into this track but it is nice to see new artists getting a break. M.O.P closes off album with &quot;Wanna be G's&quot;. P. Diddy shows his influence by getting some of the biggest artists in the game on his album, artists that are selling the most today. Personally I would of liked to see some more talent from Bad Boy Records on this album artists such as Black Rob, G-Dep and some of the established R &amp; B acts signed to the label. Soundtracks that do well commericially usually offer a wide variety of music, from well known artists (Justin Timberlake, Mary J. Blige, Nelly, Beyonce etc), and &quot;Bad Boys II Soundtrack&quot; achieves this. For the most part this is a good soundtrack with some nice songs, recommend this release to those who like the artists featured on it.

Bubba Sparxxx (Warren Anderson Mathis) second album &quot;Deliverance&quot; (2003) is an excellent release. I missed out on Bubba's first album and only heard a few songs off it. I was listening to the radio a month ago when I heard his single which shares the album title of &quot;Deliverance&quot;, I knew as soon as I heard this that it would be a hit single everything about the track is ill- beat, Timbaland chorus and Sparxxx lyrics make it an outstanding song. Timbaland's beats/production shine throughout this release. Bubba starts things off with the single &quot;Jimmy Mathis&quot; a track he named after his father and one where he gets introspective. &quot;Coming Around&quot; has Bubba talking about family to an upbeat beat and country chorus, which is followed up &quot;She Tried&quot; a sad track about losing ones woman. Bubba addresses the problems and hardships all people deal with on the deep &quot;Nowhere&quot; - beats to this track are phenomenal, and Kiley Deans vocals impressive. Bubba says he wants to be viewed as something special on this track, and he deserves to be for this is first class music. Horn backed &quot;Overcome&quot; has Sparxxx promising to make it through anything that comes his way, followed up by the rock based &quot;Warrant interlude&quot;. &quot;Warrant&quot; and &quot;New South&quot; follow both are nice, the first is about being on the run and the later has Sparxxx repping his southern roots. More decent tracks lead up to another song that really stands out for me called &quot;My Tone&quot;, love the crazy beat to this one. Fast paced closer &quot;Back in The Mud&quot; is another memorable track, on an album full of memorable tracks. I have been very impressed by Bubba Sparxxx latest album &quot;Deliverance&quot;, Bubba delivers unique Hip Hop music staying true to his roots while dropping a highly enjoyable album to listen to: full of entertaining lyrics, standout choruses and exceptional beats. Highly recommend checking this release out.

Ghostface Killah (AKA Tony Starks) provides a quality album with his fifth solo release "Fishscale" (2006). I have been bumping this album since I got it, from the opener "The Return of Clyde Smith" (skit) to the albums closer "Three Bricks" feat. the late great Notorious B.I.G. & Raekwon, Ghostface takes his audience through a memorable & original journey on this twenty four track (including skits) release. Ghostface delivers raw fastpaced rhymes on "Shakey Dog", and hooks up with his Cuban Linx brethren Raekwon for "Kilo". One of my early favorites is "The Champ", love the intro to this cut, hypes up a track which Ghostface kills. The whole Wu-Tang clan reunites for a banger "9 Milli Bros", love hearing them back together, even ODB (R.I.P.) is included on this cut. Some entertaining skits follow, and then Raekwon and Ghostface team up again for more thug stories on "R.A.G.U.". Backed by a distinctive sample from J Dilla (R.I.P.) Ghost then delivers "Whip You With A Strip" remembering being a bad kid who got beats. I saw the video for "Back Like That" the other day, Ghostface and up and coming singer Ne-Yo collaborate for another outstanding track. Ne-Yo's sings soulfully and Ghost's lyrics on point, making this cut the lead single makes sense. Ghostface delivers an upbeat & funny cut with "Be Easy" which features his "Put It On The Line" rhyme partner Trife. Grimy street cuts like "Clipse of Doom" feat. Trife & "Dogs of War" feat. Raekwon & Theodore Unit follow. His son "Sun God" is included on this cut. This whole album is full of creative concepts, "Underwater" being another good example. "Momma" is a heartfelt cut, backed by some smooth singing from Megan Rochell, Ghost drops some deep rhymes. The albums closer, which I previously mentioned, is another standout, Biggies verse is dope and Ghost and Raekwon hold their own alongside him on "Three Bricks". For some people who are new to Ghostface it may take you awile to get used to his flow, I recommend taking that time and listening to this album fully. Ghostface Killah takes his listeners on an entertaining and creative ride, providing a memorable album with "Fishscale", recommend checking it out.

Canadian Pop group Brand Van 3000 dropped an addictive song with &quot;Drinking in LA&quot;. Dont know why but this song keeps on going on and on in my head. Ofter hear this song late night on the the local radio stations on the way home from the club years later after its original release. This Song is about being young, wasting time, and having fun- a good party track. To call Bran Van solely pop is wrong as they combine soul, hiphop, rock, reggae and metal in their music. &quot;Drinking in La&quot; can be found on there album &quot;Glee&quot;. Bran Van 3000 is led by Jamie Di Salvio, and has about twenty members, based in montreal. This diversity of different artists is in intresting mixture and &quot;Drinking in LA&quot; is a fun song, enjoy.

Jay-Z second album "In My Lifetime, Vol 1" (1997) is a solid release. I liked the way Hov used Scarface samples in his intros, he started this joint off on a good note with "A Million and One Questions/Rhyme No More", which benefits from some deadly premo production. Jay-Z then delivers a standout cut with "The City Is Mine", the Blackstreet hook, and the track beat is ill. The next two tracks fall under skip material for me, and then Hov drops some on point rhymes on "Streets is Watching"- don't know why this was censored. Jay-Z shows some heart on the laidback "Lucky Me", rhyming well backed by a smooth female chorus. The album then hits a low point for me, not feeling the next three tracks at all, find them to be weak in lyrics and production. Jay-Z picks things up again for two more standouts: "Real N****z" feat. Too $hort and the albums closer "You Must Love Me". Its an artist gift and curse to deliver a classic, because later albums often get compared I won't lie though after "Reasonable Doubt" this was a disappointment for me, while there a number of standouts, there is also a lot of skip material. What I really missed was the consistency in production found on his first album, I wasn't interested in buying into Jay-Z claim of the throne being his, was bumping Big and Pac (and missing them big time) classics and wondering where Hip-Hop was going. 3.5.

D12's second album &quot;D12 World&quot; (2004) is a decent release. To be honest I have never been big into there work, I remember copping there first album and only liking a few tracks. Maybe this comes from me genuinely finding them to be a bit to out there using controversial lyrics to get attention and sell records. I generally dont care if millions buy a record, what matters to me is can I feel it, can I relate to it on some level, and can it get play in the ride. The lead single &quot;My Band&quot; is a somewhat funny track, Eminem's chorus and D12's lyrics make it a different but entertaining track. The video for this cut had me laughing...I think one of the good things about Eminem is he doesnt mind making fun of himself. Alot of early tracks just dont do much for me and fall under skip material, though there are definetly some standout tracks and for me they are &quot;How Come&quot;, the pounding second single &quot;40 Oz&quot;, and the grimey Dre produced &quot;American Psycho II&quot; feat. Breal of Cypress Hill. My favourite track is the deep &quot;Good Die Young&quot;, D12 drops an excellent cut while talking about life and death, appreciating each day and remembering those who have past. Maybe this one is my fav because D12 deliver some real relevent lyrics and take things to another level. &quot;D12 World&quot; is a release I would recommend for D12 and Eminem fans. 3.5.

Talib Kweli returns with his third solo album "The Beautiful Struggle" (2004). I like many others have been anticipating this release for a long time. Brooklyn's Kweli has delivered three great albums in "Black Star", "Reflection Eternal" (a classic in my opinion) and "Quality". The album's opener is the fast paced banger "Going Hard", a track that Kweli lyrically lights up. Hi-Tek provides the beat for "Back Up Offa Me", a track where Kweli demands some space. On "Broken Glass" Kweli talks about a girl who took the wrong path, the Neptune's provide an instrumental I am still getting used to. The albums first guest appearance comes from Faith Evans, who delivers some soulful vocals on the laidback love track "We Know". The albums first single is the well-chosen "I Try" feat. Mary J Blige, Kweli rhymes with hunger while Mary J sings well over a Kayne West beat which is similar to "Get By". The first track that really made me be like Whoa, is "Around My Way" feat. John Legend, this is an exceptional track where Kweli shines delivering some very real heartfelt lyrics. This is easily one of my favourite songs of 2004. Res then drops in for the rock based "We got the beat", a unique sounding track. My favourite collaboration on the album is "Ghetto Show", Common and Anthony Hamilton help make this an outstanding track; these three capture Ghetto life and represent their music in a positive way making this a very memorable track with great replay value. Talib and Jean Grae deliver a powerful tribute to women on "Black Girl Pain", which is followed up by the chill "Never Been In Love". Hi-Tek provides a premium beat for the title track, backed by an ill hook, Kweli drops some more on point rhymes. Talib Kweli has succeeded in delivering another excellent album with "The Beautiful Struggle". Kweli shines delivering insightful and substantial music that sticks with you. Highly recommend this release for the collection.

The second Notorious B.I.G. post-death release "Duets: The Final Chapter" (2005) dropped a few days ago. After listening to this one thoroughly I will be honest in saying I am not feeling it on the whole. Recycling B.I.G.'s old rhymes, and jazzing it up with new beats, and combining him with artists he never worked with does not really appeal to this reviewer. I still get play from "Ready to Die" and "Life After Death", so I know Biggie Smalls lyrics well. To make something clear I don't have anything against post-death albums but do believe they should be handled properly. I feel like a lot of the production is sub par (and does not fit with B.I.G's style), verses/choruses are not blended well at all, and guest appearances are average/weak. Another disappointing thing about this is very few of B.I.G.'s former Bad Boy label mates, and friends are included on this release. Their are also no new B.I.G. verses. Also whats up with the artwork, there is a lot of better images then this one that makes B.I.G. look bloated. Tracks that I thought were good: "It Has Been Said", Eminem and Obie Trice pay tribute to B.I.G. well, "Whatchu Want" feat. Jay-Z - a track to bump, "Hold Ya Head" feat. Bob Marley - combination of two legends from two different music genres is worth hearing. I think people who are new to Notorious may appreciate "Duets: The Final Chapter" more then those of us who know his lyrics by heart.

Ja Rule's sixth album is "R.U.L.E." (2004). To say Ja Rule has been through some controversy over the last couple of years would be an understatement. It's also a well known story that does not need to be told again. Ja Rule gets back to the basics with this latest offering, for him that means making records that sell, and I believe this one will. Rule shows he is still hungry on "The Last of the Mohicans", while Black Child delivers an on point chorus. R Kelly and Ashanti hook up with Ja Rule on the commercial single and chart hit "Wonderful". The albums other single which features established MC's Jadakiss and Fat Joe is the blazing hot "New York" which has deservingly blown up. Rule sings well on the smooth laidback "Manuel". First track I have no caring for is "Get It Started" feat. Ciara. The Inc's newest member, R & B singer Lloyd drops in for "Caught Up" a semi-decent track which may be more appreciated by R & B fans. Things pick up again with the standout "Gun Talk", feeling the lyrics and beat to this cut. Ja Rule then hooks up with Giselle on "Never Thought", a decent collaboration. Ja Rule, Trick Daddy and Chink Santana pay tribute to those who have died on the impressive "Life Goes On". "Where I'm From" is an excellent track, Ja Rule goes deep talking about the ghetto, poverty, prison and death, while Lloyd provides a memorable chorus. The albums closer and longest track is the 8 minute "Passion", a track where Rule reflects on the events of the past year, delivering a powerful chorus while finishing his track by doing shout outs and giving thanks. Ja Rule has succeeded in delivering a solid album, following the formula of some of his early albums, I find this album to be step up from his past commercial releases (Pain is Love, Rule 3:36, Last Temptation). My favourite tracks are "New York", "Gun Talk" and "Where I'm from". By an artist's sixth album people should know what they feel about his work, I recommend "R.U.L.E" to those who appreciate his music.

Pete Rock &amp; C.L. Smooth's second album &quot;The Main Ingredient&quot; (1994) is an underated slept on gem. Pete Rock's amazing production matched with C.L.'s addictive and intelligent rhyming make an album to remember. Beats are excellent from start to finish on this sixteen track release, cd has great replay value and music sounds ahead of its time which it was. My favourite track is &quot;It's On You&quot; love the verses, beat and background chorus on this one. Love the way &quot;I Get Physical&quot; flows and the outstanding guitar &amp; piano backed &quot;All The Places&quot; has C.L. talking about where he has been- a very memorable track. Relaxed tracks like &quot;Carmel City&quot; , &quot;Searching&quot; and lead single &quot;Take You There&quot; create a feel good album. Music on this is substantial and relaxed at the same time. Every track on this is nice to me, and &quot;The Main Ingredient&quot; flows concurrently throughout with the end result being a highly enjoyable and memorable album which I would recommend for any Hip Hop collection.

Four years after the original "Nu-Mixx Klazzics" Koch Records provides a followup in "Nu-Mixx Klazzics Vol. 2: Evolution: Duets & Remixes" (2007). Being a dedicated fan of 2Pac's music I have to say it was a nice surprise to come across this release. I am not a fan of the original Nu-Mixx Klazzics a project which faltered badly. The production is on point throughout this release, as are the guest appearances which come from: Kurupt, Butch Kassiy, Fatal Hussein, Candy Hill, Dwele, The Outlawz, Styles P, Snoop Dogg, Boot Camp Clik, M-1 & Daz Dillinger. "Picture Me Rollin" is a timeless Pac track from the All Eyez On Me Album, and a good starting point for this release, the production remains the same, with the difference being a smooth hook from Butch Cassidy and some additional lyrics from Pac's former Death Row label mate Kurupt. "Keep Goin" is a rare 2pac track which originally appeared on the Tha Dogg Pounds "2002" titled as "Don't Stop" this version includes an appearance from Pac's homeboy and original Outlawz member Fatal Hussein. The Illmind produced "Whatz Ya Phone #" follows, this version features some new production and an appearance from Los Angeles R&B/Hip Hop trio Candy Hill. "Staring Through My Rear View" is a classic Pac track which originally appeared on the Gang Related Soundtrack. This is a great track to include on this release as many of the newer generation may not have heard it. While the original featured an appearance from Phil Collins this one features vocals from Dwele. I like both versions. Next up is "Hail Mary (Rock Remix)" feat. The Outlawz, the change of themes to Rock production works. Kurupt and the Outlawz return for the laid back "Got My Mind Made Up". Another highlight of this album is the Remix of Pac's Above The Rim soundtrack cut "Pain", this version features another solid chorus from Butch Cassidy, and lyrics from Lox member Styles P who holds his own. I was happy to hear "Lost Souls" feat. Outlawz, a track I have not heard in a long time, originally made for the Gang Related Sountrack this is memorable track. Pac and Snoop's classic collabo is remixed with some harder production on "Wanted Dead Or Alive (Gangsta Party)", then veteran Rap group Boot Camp Clik- MC's who worked with Pac back in the day appear on "Initiated". I agree with the other reviewer who would of liked to see KC & Jojo appear on "How Do U Want It" as they did on the original - instead there is some mediocre production and a forgettable background chorus. The later version of "Picture Me Rollin" features some new rhymes from Pac's brethren the Outlawz. Overall "Nu-Mixx Klazzics Vol. 2: Evolution: Duets & Remixes" is a quality release which can be enjoyed by new and old fans alike.

2Pac's "Greatest Hits" (1998) is a excellent collection of twenty six Tupac Shakur tracks. I have all of Tupac's albums, and I have to say this is the one I recommend to anyone who wants a near quintessential collection of music from albums he dropped while alive. This is also the release I would recommend to anyone who is new to his music or for anyone who usually listens to other music genres but wants to see what Pac's music is about. I feel that there are some better tracks that could have been put on this album, and that is why I say "near quintessential", to decide what tracks to include and not include must of been a very tough process. Tupac was very prolific in his work, so prolific that I think he could have had a few Greatest Hits albums. Overall though the track selection is comprehensive and the album flows with impressive continuity. Executive Production credit goes to Afeni Shakur (Amaru/Interscope) and Suge Knight (Death Row Records), real credit for track production really has to go the many producers who produced Tupac's music over the years. Also props should be given to all the artists who appeared on tracks on this release. Artists like Snoop Dogg, Dramacydal, KC & Jojo, Outlawz, Digital Underground, Thug Life, Raw Fusion, Roger Troutman, Dre, Danny Boy, Syke, CPO, Nate Dogg, Val Young, Top Dogg, Dru Down as well as the many artists whose interpolations were used. Music on this release comes from the following albums:2Pacalypse Now (1991)- "Trapped" & "Brenda's Got a Baby" (2).Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. (1993)- "Keep Ya Head Up" & "I Get Around" (2).Thug Life Volume One (1994)- "How Long Will They Mourn Me?" (1)Me Against the World (1995)- "Temptations", "Me Against the World", "So Many Tears", "Dear Mama" (4).How Do You Want It LP (1996)- "Hit'em Up","California Love" (2)All Eyez On Me (Feb 1996)- "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", "How Do You Want It", "Life Goes On", "I Ain't Mad at cha", "Picture Me Rollin'", "All About You", "Heartz of Men" (7).Makaveli(Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory) (Nov 1996)- "Hail Mary", "Toss It Up", "To Live and Die in L.A." (3)"Greatest Hits" also has previously unreleased tracks: "God Bless the Dead", "Unconditional Love", "Troublesome 96", "Changes" (4). All four of these tracks are great, "Unconditional Love" and "Changes" are exceptional additions, both tracks standout out for me and are very moving and go real deep. Its 2003, and we are now coming up on seven years (Sept 13th 1996) since the Hip Hop world lost one of its most talented, loved/hated (by some) rappers & poets, a legendary artist whos music will remain classic and timeless. Highly recommend "Greatest Hits" for anyone who loves Tupac Shakur and Hip Hop music at its best.

CNN, the duo of MC's Capone and Noreaga made there name in 1997 with there best album to date &quot;The War Report&quot; which is highlighted by reality street raps from two hungry MC's, matched with memorable beats and quality production. Guest appearances come from Tragedy Khadafi, Imam T.H.U.G, Castro, Mussolini, Mendosa, Troy Outlaw, and Mobb Deep. After the intro the powerful &quot;Bloody Money&quot; gets things started, Capone and Noreaga rip up an echoing beat, showcasing two very distinct and impressive flows. Tragedy Khadafi who was a big part of this album drops in for the grimey &quot;Stick You&quot; and &quot;Parole Violators&quot; which also features Havoc of Mobb Deep. Things slow down and change with the standout &quot;Live on Live Long&quot;, this is a sad sounding track where Noreaga pays tribute and shows love to those who are in jail and those who have past. Nore shines on this one singing his own chorus. The ominous &quot;Neva Die Alone&quot; brings things back to pace and is followed up the well known &quot;T.O.N.Y.&quot; (Top Of New York) a track where CNN and Tragedy Khadfi talk about there ambitions backed by an ill beat. Next couple of tracks flow through well then Capone goes solo dropping a number of premium verses on the Marley Marl produced &quot;Capone Bone&quot;. I am still waiting for Capone to drop a solo album hopefully it will happen soon. There is no such thing as &quot;Halfway Thugs&quot;, CNN do a good job tearing into the fakes on this one. CNN then collabrate with Mobb Deep and Tragedy Khadifi on &quot;L.A., L.A.&quot; (Kuwait Mix Marley Marl) a response to Tha Dogg Pounds &quot;New York, New York&quot;, two tracks that are a reminder of the East-West beef which was still very much alive back then. Two more solid thugged out tracks follow in &quot;Illegal Life&quot; and &quot;Black Gangsta&quot;. CNN then slows things down for the upbeat &quot;Closer&quot; which features some smooth R &amp; B vocals from Nneka. Tragedy Khadafi deserves alot of credit, his strong presence is found all throughout this album whether it be on guest spots or production he helped CNN elevate there game. &quot;The War Report&quot; is an impressive album which I highly recommend for the collection.

Alchemist's debut album is "1st Infantry" (2004). A lot of people have been looking forward to this album, Alchemist has over the years established himself as one of Rap's talented producers. Does this live up to the hype? - Yes and No. Alchemist's delivers some standout production, but the MC's that are featured on this don't always deliver lyrically. The intro briefly showcases some excellent beats Alchemist has delivered in the past. Game and Prodigy rhyme over a repetitive banging beat on the grimey "Dead Bodies" while the Lox make a decent appearance on "The Essence". The single "Hold You Down" feat. Prodigy, Nina Sky & Illa Gee is the first real standout track to me, Prodigy rhymes well and Alchemists beat is sick. Not feeling Stat Quo on "Stop the Show" would of liked to see more of MOP. Next Havoc, Noyd, Jae Hood and Styles hook up for the hardcore "D-Block to QB. Lloyd Banks makes a solid appearance on "Bangers", feeling Alchemists beat, first heard this off a mixtape. One of two Southern Artists on this is Devin the Dude who makes an appearance on "Where can we go", to me the beat seems to strong for the laidback Devin. Over the years Alchemist has laced Mobb Deep with some memorable beats, "It's A Craze" though is rather average. Alchemist gives Chinky a chance to shine solo on "Strength Of Pain", she delivers some real lyrics and sings well over a distinct beat. Another real standout for me is "Tick Tock", its good to see Nas and Prodigy on a track together again, both rhyme well while Alchemist provides another good beat. Alchemist saves the best for last, my favourite track is "Different Worlds" where Alchemist and Twin rhyme back and forth about coming up from completly different backgrounds. This is the first track where Alchemist stands out as an MC to me, while Twin of Infamous Mobb grabs the listeners attention with his unique flow. My favourite tracks are: "Hold You Down", "Tick Tock" and "Different Worlds". On reflection I feel like Alchemist stayed true to his formula, making music for the streets, and while this one probably be skipped over by most mainstream audiences, underground heads will be feeling it.

The year is about to end and I have noticed no one has reviewed Hell Razah and 4th Disciple's "Freedom of Speech" (2004). I recently came across this highly slept on release. I have never followed Sunz of Man closely, having read up on them I learned they consisted of a number of different Wu-Tang affiliated rappers who have provided a number of group albums, this release however is a show of talent from two members- Hell Razah and 4th Disciple. The album starts off with powerful political cuts like "Rebel Music" and "Article One". One of my early favourites is "One Harmony", this cut is laced with a sick instrumental which Hell and 4th kill. More memorable tracks like "Oh Baby" and "Way of Life" follow, the duo lay it down whether simply entertaining the crowd or providing Hip Hop history. "Baby Girl" flows through smoothly, a memorable love tribute, which goes deep. My favourite track is the laidback "Take Ya Time" which has Hell Razah and 4th Disciple reminiscing on days past, the lyrics and chorus (Take your time young man I remember they used to say all that glitter aint gold..) to this track are off the hook. On the next track "Same Ol Thugs", Hell Razah and 4th Disciple talk to and about the ladies providing another track to remember. They shine again when rhyming about life on the streets on the excellent "Project Love" and eerie "Who Gonna Die Next". The rest of tracks lack some of the memorable production of the early part of album (maybe they ran out of money or choose a more basic production style) all the same they are decent enough. Hell Razah and 4th Disciple really represent underground Hip Hop well, their music is lyrically genuine, political and powerful and the sampling and production on the first 2/3 of this album is impressive. I recommend checking out this release.

Lost Boyz fourth album "Forever" (2005) quietly slipped under the vast majority of music fans radar's two weeks back and is bound to be slept on. With Freaky Tah dead (R.I.P.), and Spigg Nice serving a long jail sentence, I really did not expect to see another album from this group. Mr. Cheeks and Pretty Lou have made it happen though with some help from Slumlordaz, Jason, Van Dam, Ob the Cat, PMD, Lil Razz, Netty, Ruler Divine and Queen Josephine. Unreleased material from Spigg Nice and Freaky Tah is included in this release. Also included are classics "Jeep, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz" and "Renee".The album starts off with the Lost Boyz letting it be known on the intro that they are still holding it down strong ten years later. LB delivers an original track right off the bat with "Not a Test". A hungry sounding Mr. Cheeks leads the way on "Spit Flow" doing exactly that while talking about where LB's been. Slumlordaz and Jason make the album first guest appearances on "Shine Em Up". One of my early favorites is "Make Music", backed by a sad beat, Mr. Cheeks shines while reminiscing about days past and where Lost Boyz are at now. Another standout is the deep "Keep Ridin'", Freaky Tah's death is remembered, and the Lost Boyz promise to keep on going. Ob the Cat and Van Dam then drop in for the laidback "Basically", which is followed by the classic "Jeep, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz". "Still A Winner" and "I'm Coming" are decent tracks about the ladies. Some average guest appearances follow, and then the Lost Boyz shine again with two more outstanding tracks in "My Way" feat. Jason and "All I Know" feat. Ruler Divine. One of the things I have always appreciated about the Lost Boyz is the way the deliver heartfelt music; they do it all throughout this release and especially on "U R My Love" feat. Queen Josephine. "Renee" is a true Lost Boyz classic and the perfect track to finish off this release. In comparison to they're past albums "Forever" is more laidback, and there's far less fast paced tracks (which fans may miss). The more I listen to this one though, the more I appreciate it, happy to see the Lost Boyz back at it, highly recommend fans of the group check this one out.

Musiq Soulchild's (A.K.A. Talib Johnson) fourth album is "Luvanmusiq" (2007) a short twelve track release from the Philadelphia native. Musiq looks for some companionship on the album's opener and lead single "B.U.D.D.Y". Musiq sings about a beautiful lady on "Ms. Philadelphia". Musiq then looks for some help in overcoming trust issues and learning how to love on "Teachme", while paying tribute to a special woman who makes him want to be a "Betterman". The first track is interesting in that Musiq confront's a relationship issue which challenges many men who are taught to be stoic and keep their emotions in check. Musiq looks for "the one" on "The Questions". On the slow jam "Today", Musiq sings about the search for the love, and how we sometimes meet our loved ones when we least expect it. "Makeyouhappy" is an upbeat feel good joint, decent love ballads "Ridiculous" & "Millionaire" follow. Musiq slows things down some for "Take You There", and provides a laidback "Lullaby". The album's closer is "Greatest Love", a soulful Musiq finishes the album off on a good note. Musiq is happy on this release providing a lot of love ballads, and keeping his music genuine. I personally would of liked to see a larger album with more variety/guest appearances, example track's like "Struggle No More" with Anthony Hamilton & Jaheim. At the same time Musiq avoids some of the missteps of other artist's by keeping his release short. "B.U.D.D.Y." has about six different Hip Hop remixes, I am not a big fan of any of them, so I prefer the fact that Musiq kept them off the album. Overall "Luvanmusiq is a stellar effort which may satisfy new and old fans alike. 3.5.

Jaheim's a talented singer and he showed this at times on his debut &quot;Ghetto Love&quot; (2001). Blessed with a soulful voice, Jaheim delivers the goods on early tracks like &quot;Looking for Love&quot; and the hit single &quot;Could it Be&quot;. Jah then excels on the title track &quot;Ghetto Love&quot; a memorable smooth love song. Not really feeling some of the midway tracks, thankfully things pick up. &quot;Anything&quot; is without a doubt my favourite track on this album, Jaheim and Next hook up for a powerful love song, one that will echo in your head. Its a real track about love and giving everything you have for the one you love. The mellowed out &quot;Waitin' on you&quot; feat. Miss Jones flows through nicely as does &quot;Remarkable&quot; feat. Terry Dexter. &quot;Ready, Willing &amp; Able&quot; is a deep slow jam with an oldschool feel to it, while &quot;Love Is Still Here&quot; is a short track about lost love. One of the last tracks Jaheim drops is called &quot;For Moms&quot;, a tribute to his mom who past away. &quot;Could It Be&quot; (Anything You Want Remix) finishes off the album on a fastpaced upbeat note. Jaheim delivered a strong debut album with this release and though there is some filler, a number of standout tracks make &quot;Ghetto Love&quot; an album I recommend for R &amp; B fans. 3.5.

AZ (Anthony Cruz) continues to deliver the heat with his latest album "A.W.O.L." (2005). The first real standout for me is "Never Change" a cut where AZ reflects about a friend who died, delivering some memorable lyrics and a premium chorus. Wu-Tang's Raekwon and Ghostface then drop in for a solid collaboration repping their city "New York". Backed by a crazy beat, AZ rhymes with hunger on "Still Alive". My current favorite is "City Of Gods", AZ shines rhyming well and laces this one with another impressive chorus. One of the things I have always liked about AZ is he remains genuine. Half-A-Mil was murdered a few years ago, AZ brings him back for the sad and heartfelt "Street Life" feat. Begetz. AZ then tells a short "Bedtime Story" remembering past years. It's nice to see AZ getting the production he deserves, Premo hooked AZ up for "The Come Up" and AZ shines again. Not a Bounty Killer fan, so not feeling "Envious", while the title track is solid. The bonus material is decent, good to that CL Smooth is still around feeling "Magic Hour". I recently heard another new excellent AZ track called "Game of Life", wish that one had been included on this release. For years people have slept on AZ's music, I don't know if that will continue, I do highly recommend checking out "A.W.O.L.".

Young Noble & E.D.I. of the Outlawz deliver the goods on the fourteen-track duo album "Against All Oddz" (2006). After the laidback intro "Ride It Out", Young Noble & E.D.I. provide an anthem with the raw "Outlaw Pride", repping the Outlaw movement and being independent. The next track "Leave the Past Behind" is powerful, anyone that knows this group knows that they have been through a lot. On this cut Young Noble & E.D.I. reflect on how they came up and what they have been through in a track about moving on. The next cut "Clutchin On A 45" is fire, the Outlawz duo deliver some memorable lyrics while using turning their mentors lyrics into a dope chorus. "Pimpin In My Blood" flows through well, and then the Outlawz provide an outstanding track with "Make You Happy", a feel good love song with a lot of heart to it. My favourite track is the exceptional "Same Thang", backed by a tight beat Noble & E.D.I. shine on a track which I have on repeat. This upbeat cut is about coming out on top no matter what. The Outlaw duo then pays attention to the ladies on "Keep On Doing It" and "I Wanna Know". "All Family, No Friends" vibes well, as does the scarface sample used on the interlude "Big Time". The Outlawz talk about other rappers, and the rap game on the strong "Dont Change", a track about not forgetting ones roots. I can think of more then one rapper when listening to this one. Noble and E.D.I. close the album off with "We Outlawz" thanking their listeners, repping their movement and remembering all their friends and family that have passed. Young Noble & E.D.I. provide a release worth adding to the collection with "Against All Oddz", I personally think the Outlawz continue to get better on solo and as group with each new release and they are finally getting the production they deserve. I am looking forward to the next group album, for fans of the group this is definitely an album not to sleep on.

Eminem delivers "Curtain Call" (2005), a seventeen-track release, which contains twelve tracks from his previous albums; an intro, three new cuts and one live one. The three new tracks are "Fack", "Shake That" feat. Nate Dogg and "When I Am Gone". The first two of these are sub par cuts, the kind that made this reviewer hit skip as fast as he could. "When I Am Gone" is a quality track though and a good addition to this release, Eminem drops some very real lyrics about his life, while delivering his own outstanding chorus. I did not think much of Eminem much-heralded "Stan" duet with Elton John, this grammy collab is included. The older material contains a number of great Eminem tracks; some of my personal favourites are "The Way I Am", the original "Stan" feat. Dido, the amazing "Lose Yourself", impressive "Sing For Me" and heartfelt "Mockingbird". "Like Toy Soldiers" and Eminems personal dedication to his mom "Cleaning Out My Closet" is also well placed on this release. People reading this review will notice I left out a number of tracks when mentioning favourites, in all honesty tracks like "My Name Is", "The Real Slim Shady" and "Just Lose It" never had an appeal to me (no matter how many thousand times I heard them on the radio). I think everyone who enjoyed some of Eminems music would probably have a different listing of what tracks he or she wants on this. Those who love his music can look out for some new verses on a track called "The Most Shady" which will be on the upcoming Biggie Duet album. In a world where music is easily downloadable, I think artists should take things to a new level when providing releases such as this. I personally think greatest hits albums (if this is what it was supposed to be) should be a minimum two-disc release, jammed with the maximum amount of classic music (known hits, slept on hits) from that artist. People deserve more bang for their buck. Still this release will put a smile on many an Eminem fans face. 3.5.

Shynes (Jamal Barrows) 2000 self titled debut, was a good one. &quot;What'cha Going to Do&quot; opens the album powerfully, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;feat. Barrington Levy has got nice flavour too it, and the video brings you to Shynes home Belize. On &quot;Its Ok&quot; and &quot;Bonnie and Shyne&quot; Shyne comes through with his strong flow, and keeps the listner entertained. The later being a track for the ladies, feat. Barrington Levy once again. &quot;Get Out&quot; is my favourite track on the album, has a sick beat, and Shynes flow on it is addictive. &quot;The Commision&quot; is a blazing track,and Shynes delivery on it is ill. On this album alone, Shyne helped bring street credibility back to Bad Boy Records (following Black Robs Debut). Shynes vocalist tones are sick, and his punchlines keep you entertained. Beats could of been better on this album, they were either really good (for the tracks mentioned), and not so good on the ones not mentioned. Also his lyrical content needs some work. Now Shyne sits in jail for ten years, and the hiphop world has lost one of its future stars. However this loss is not indefinite, and I believe Shyne will overcome, and when he does come back he is going to change the game.

"Ultimate Aaliyah" (2005) is an impressive two disc release (+ Bonus dvd) consisting of twenty-five tracks from Aaliyah (Aaliyah Dana Haughton, January 16th 1979-August 25th 2001). Aaliyah's death at 22 years old sent shocks through the music world, a real tragedy - may she rest in peace. In her short lifetime Aaliyah was a prolific grammy winning artist, model & actress. This release opens with the exceptional "One In A Million", Aaliyah shines like the sun on this memorable love ballad. Next to this sweet cut, my favourite Aaliyah track is the outstanding slow jam "I Care 4 U", Aaliyah comforts a man who's women left him. I remember when "We Need A Resoultion" was blowing up on the radio, its a commercially friendly track which is relevant to the everyday relationship issue's real life people deal with. Another hit collaboration with Timbaland is "Try Again" made for "Romeo Must Die" a movie starring Jet Li and Aaliyah. "Rock The Boat" & "More Then A Woman" are to more memorable joints from her self-titled album. The "I Miss You" (Remix) is a moving and powerful track, Aaliyah sings soulfully about a lost love - Aaliyah really captured the feeling of a breakup and the longing people have on this premium joint. Disc two features bonus, soundtrack, and guest appearance/collaboration material. Timbaland & Magoo team up with Wyclef and provide a heartfelt tribute to Aaliyah on "Hold On" . "Ultimate Aaliyah" is a release for any R & B collection.

Talib Kweli & Hi Tek's "Reflection Eternal" (2000) is a very innovative and memorable hip hop album, one of the nicest I have come across in recent years. Executive produced by the duo, Hi-Tek impressively lead produces or co-produces every track. Guest appearances come from: Kool G Rap, Xzibit, Les Nubians, Mos Def, Rah Digga & De La Soul. Talib Kwelis lyrics all throughout are excellent, he keeps listners entertained by covering a wide variety of conscientious topics that really took this listener to another level. Listening to this album makes me feel good, lyrically Kweli goes far past the normal boundaries many of his counterparts do, providing positive and truly enjoyable music that left me more then content. Rumbling "Move Something" gets things started, and has Kweli challenging his listners to expand there horizons. Upbeat "The Blast" flows well and features nice background vocals from Vinia Mojica. Fastpaced "This Means You" feat. Mos-Def is sick, love the instrumental to it. "Memories Live" is a smooth track which has Kweli reflecting about days pasts, talking about how he found direction, and some of the rappers that inspired him like KRS-One and Common. "Down for the Count" opens with an intro from heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis and features Xzibit and Rah Digga, an intresting collabration track. "Ghetto Afterlife" opens with Talib talking politics, and features oldschool legend Kool G Rap another nice collabration. Relaxed "Love Language", opens with Talib line "the language of love can not be translated"- this rings true, as does another line "Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge so when we are arguing nobody wins", insightful commentary like makes listners think. More entertaining tracks like "Soul Rebels" feat. De La Soul & Eternalists follow and lead up to my favourite track the deep "Good Mourning" which features an addictive sad sounding beat, and has Kweli talking about life and death, and ends with a tribute to relatives, singers and rappers who have past away. Album ends with the powerfully profound "For Woman" track made for the ladies, relevant for many. Talib Kwelis lyrcism on this release is among the best I have ever come across. Hi-Tek's production is brillaint and in my opinion, he remains one of the most underated producers out even after this release. The term "Classic" is often over-used, in this case I find it fitting. I recommend "Reflection Eternal" to people who enjoy old school hip hop, to those who pay close attention to lyrics and enjoy hip hop music of real quality.

Black Dialogue's debut album "The Perceptionists" (2005) is a solid release from the Boston trio of Mr. Lif, Akrobatik & DJ Fakts One. The first real standout for me is Memorial Day- The Perceptionists talk to the President asking "Where are the Weapons of Mass Destruction?" while doing their own narrative of being soldiers in Iraq, calling out the politicians and dropping some very memorable lines. This track is powerful, and worth listening to whatever your stance on the war is. The Perceptionists then flip things delivering the laidback "Love Letters" an outstanding and intelligent track about looking for love. The Perceptionists shine again on the title track "Black Dialogue" getting political and repping black culture while calling out the fakes and talking about the ignorance they see in today's culture. Midway not feeling some of the tracks, two more standouts finish off the album the first of these is the exceptional "5 O'clock" feat. Phonte of Little Brother, an ode to enjoying life after work, making a plan about life and business, and focusing on where you want to be- this whole track is full of quotable lines. The album closes off with the chilled out "Breath in the Sun". Recommend checking out "Black Dialogue" if your looking for something different. 3.5.

Dilated Peoples latest album &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; (2004) is a solid fourteen track release. What first attracted me to this release was watching the video for the amazing single &quot;This Way&quot; feat. Kayne West, an exceptional cut dedicated to the late JMJ. This to me is one of the most powerful tracks I have come across this year, positive with first class beats, chorus and lyrics. Another outstanding track for me is &quot;Tryin to Breathe&quot;, the lyrics on this one go deep. Devin the Dude drops in for &quot;Poisonous&quot; a track about a woman on a rampage. On &quot;Reach Us&quot; Dilated talks about there craft, life, change, and there fans. Dilated Peoples show there love for there crew and family and dedication to stay focused on the memorable &quot;Love and War&quot;, then Alchemist laces Dilated with another standout beat on &quot;World on Wheels&quot;. The variety of memorable beats are a real highlight of this release, unfortantely I dont always find the Dilated MC's entertaining on the MIC, while there are no tracks I would label bad there are a number that fall under skip material for me. Overall though there are a number of premium tracks which make &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; an album definetly worth checking out for Dilated Peoples fans, and for those who enjoy a group that thrives on being experimental and innovative.

Akon provides an excellent release with his sophomore album "Konvicted" (2006). A relatively short diverse album, guest appearances come from Eminem, Styles P (of the Lox), T-Pain and Snoop Dogg. Eminem is featured on the album's first single "Smack That", while Snoop appears on the second single "I Wanna Love You", with both cuts getting heavy rotation on the radio and in the clubs. I prefer the later, Akon and Snoop provide a outstanding track. Styles P's lyrics and Akon's singing are on point on the grimy "Blown Away". Midway Akon slows things down putting heart into cuts like "The Rain", "Never Took the Time" and "Mama Africa". Akon shines on "Gangsta Bop", an excellent track; Akon's singing & lyrics are memorable. Akon goes real deep on the heartfelt and exceptional "Tired of Runnin", with on point lines like "I learned theirs no one to catch you when your falling, and their will be no one to hear you when your calling". Akon reflects on days past, and people's daily life and moral struggles on the powerful "Once in A While". "Don't Matter" is an upbeat love ballad, Akon sings soulfully about overcoming all the odds to be with the one you love. It's been awhile since I have bought a cd, which has quality music from beginning to end, without skip/filler material. Akon's "Konvicted" is definitely an album worth adding to the collection.

Tragedy Khadafi's fourth album &quot;Still Reportin&quot; (2003) is a excellent release. Alot of people dont know much about Tragedy originally known as the Intelligent Hoodlum a member of Marley Marl's Juice Crew who has released three previous albums (Intelligent Hoodlum 1990, Tragedy: Saga of a Hoodlum 1993, and most recently in 2000 Against all Odds). Running in at fourteen tracks, guest appearances come from Havoc,Littles, Christ Castro, Rashida, Sha Self Capone and V-12. Tragedy is one of those slept on MCs who never really get there due in my opinion, I like how he has gotten less known but talented producers Booth, Scram Jones, Dart La, Sha Shelf, Ben and Abe, Just One to handle the production on this, and there production is impressive. I also like the fact that hes back to working with CNN again. Got the first track and title track, &quot;Still Reporting'&quot; on regular rotation on the moment, Khadafis dedication track for all the fallen soldiers is a great starter to the album, like the beat and sample to this one. &quot;Code&quot; feat Havoc and Littles is a solid three way collabration, Dart La produced &quot;Hood&quot; feat. Christ Castro, is laced with a sick beat, and is another memorable track. I had never heard of Christ Castro prior to this release and I like his appearances on this. Tragedy calms things down a bit on the relaxed &quot;Hood Love&quot; feat. Rashida a track dedicated to a real love, some rappers try to make tracks like this one and come off sounding corny, Tragedy does not, keeping his lyrics simple and ending up with a smooth Rap/R&amp;B collabration track. Tragedy starts the &quot;The Message&quot; off introspectively by pointing out a fault of his in disrespecting some women in the past and leads into talking about the streets and industry. Tragedys lyrical content on Sha Self produced &quot;Walk Wit Me&quot; (911) is in depth, he talks about everything from the streets, to Hiroshima, Pearl Harbour, Geronimo Pratt, Bush and Bin Laden. &quot;U Make Me&quot; feat Capone, Littles &amp; V-12, uses some sick horns, and V-12 (an artist I have never heard of) sings well on this track and later on &quot;Can't Figure&quot;. Hardcore &quot;The Truth&quot; feat. Christ Castro is another good collabration, engaging to see fellow QB artist Nas lines mixed into it. Scram Jones produced &quot;Crying on the Inside&quot; closes off the album powerfully, a track Tragedy dedicates to his Mom who passed away. This is not an album to sleep on, highly recommend Tragedy Khadafi's &quot;Still Reportin'&quot;.

Red 1, one third of Vancouver Hip Hop group the Rascalz (DJ Kemo, Misfit, Red 1) provides his debut solo album with "Beg For Nothing" (2007). This album is released on Red 1's label Killawat and is being distributed by SonyBMG Music Canada. This twenty-track release features guest appearances from Afu-Ra, Barrington Levy, Concise, Cecile, Misfit, Saukrates, Fito Blanko, PJ Soul, Lamar Ashe, Heat Wave, Lamar & Jah Fus.Some Jamaican's get the audience hyped up on the "Live and Direct" (Intro), which is followed up by the banging "Dem No Worry We" a solid collaboration between Red 1 & Afu Ra. Saw the video for this cut a few months ago, and learned an album was on the way. Red 1 & Barrington Levy shine on the outstanding first single "No Fuss", a feel good party track, that this reviewer has had on repeat. This one takes me back to when the Rascalz collaborated with Levy & K-OS for "Top Of The World". Rapper Concise (The Black Knight), another Vancouver MC drops in for "Giving Up", a track which has both MC's letting it be known that they are going to stay on the grind. Red 1's kicks some reflective and introspective lyrics on the upbeat "Moment In Time", while repping the streets on another banger "Run Da Strip". Red 1 keeps things grimy on "Red Lite", dropping some thugged out lyrics. Red 1 talks to/with the ladies on "I Got It" feat. Cecile & "She Rude". I have not heard any new music from Saukrates in a long time so it's good to see him and Red 1's partner in rhyme Fit (Misfit) on "Reckless". Fito Blank kicks it with Red 1 on the reggaetown based "Mas Fuego" (Son Killa). Not feeling that collobration but the follow up track "Toppa Top" is a memorable reggae-Hip Hop interlude. On "Shanty" Red 1 tells of what he's seen on the streets of some of the world's most impoverished nations, reflecting on how no people and especially children deserve that fate. He keeps the conscious lyrics going on "Fantasy". "It's Over" is a ballad, Red 1 sings on this upbeat joint saying goodbye to a trife woman. The album's biggest colloboration "Say The Word" features newcomers PJ Soul, Heatwave & Lamar. "Plot Me" is a standout track about overcoming all the obstacles, and haters. Red 1 talks to a special lady on "Dat Girl" backed by some smooth vocals from singer Lamar, then rhymes alongside Reggae singer Jah Fuse on "Dead Again". The album's closing cut "What Have We Learnt" (Outro) does not feature Red 1 and has various voices (from some movie I don't know) kicking various thoughts on scarcity, control, secret societies etc.Red 1 delivers a diverse and impressive debut with "Beg For Nothing". My favourite track on this release is "No Fuss", hopefully this one will get the credit it deserves and blow up on the radio. It's hard to make it these days as a Canadian Hip Hop artist, it's good to see a MC from my city delivering quality music - recommend checking this one out. Two thumbs up, will be looking out for a Rascalz reunion album. 3.5.

"Thug Angel: The Life of an Outlaw" (2002) is a good soundtrack. Listed as 16 tracks here, its actually 22 when you include the intros/interviews which come from Fatal, Storm, and Mutulu Shakur. Music comes from the Outlawz, Trulife, Mack 10, Young Dre, G Money, Tech N9NE, Free Jack, Storm, Kumasi, Hope, QD3, Femi Ojetunde, Mac Mall, Big Syke, Ray Luv, Keplyn, Africa Heartbeat, Troy Horne, Hope Shorter, Stepchylde, and Johhny "J". Three of the Outlawz, Napolean, Young Noble & Hellraza start things off strong with the title track "Thug Angel: The Life of an Outlaw". Next TruLife, Mack 10 & Young Dre hook up for a banging collabration on "We Them Gangstas". Young Dre and G Money drop a real standout over some premium beats on "Heavenly Father". Tech N9NE then delivers another nice cut with "Keep on Keepin' On" which features vocals from Big Krizz Kaliko and Kutt. Storm's two interview's go deep, listening to her talk about Pac you can just feel the love. Then she hooks up with talented R & B singer Selena Johnson and delivers an exceptional track with "Pain". Kumasi & Hope deliver another decent collabration with "Soldier", then Fatal talks about when he first met Pac, and how Pac lifted him up. Young Noble, Napolean, Edi of the Outlawz then drop "Euphanasia" an unreleased cut from 1996. Mac Mall and Pac's boy Big Syke drop a grimey track with "Killuminati" and TruLife, Young Noble and Napolean murder the fastpaced "Life". Another standout is Ray Luv's "The Day the World Ended", impressive lyrics, memorable beat. Mutulu Shakur (Atlanta State Penitentiary) shares another side of Pac. Troy Horne and Hope Shorter drop a impressive duet with the positive "Champion" and producer Johnny "J" steps up to the MIC for a change with Stepchlyde on the moving "Thinking of You" (Tribute to Tupac). Fatal, Noble, Edi and Napolean of the Outlawz close off the album well with "Killaz in Here", a track dedicated to Pac and Kadafi. Inside the cd insert, many of the artists give there dedications to Tupac, and collectively throughout this release and the movie, you can feel the respect and love these people had for him. This is a soundtrack I would recommend to Pac fans like myself. One.

Canadian Hiphop Pioneer Maestro Fresh Wes (Wes Williams) is the man credited for helping make Rap music a business in the Canadian Music industry and paving the way for many Canadian rappers to come. In 1989 he released Symphony In Effect which went platinum and contained the hit single &quot;Let your Backbone Slide&quot; (the biggest selling canadian rap track ever on the biggest selling album), and in 1998 almost ten years later, his 6th album &quot;Built to Last&quot; came out. Nowadays he goes by Maestro. Guest appearances on this album come from Snow, Ghetto Concept, Michie Mee, Carla Marshal, and acclaimed R &amp; B singer Glenn Lewis among others. Production comes from of Canadians hiphops most well known faces: Saukrates, Kardinal Offishal, Solitaire, Jay-Rome, K-Cut, Tyson and Frankenstein among others. Seventeen tracks in total. The albums lead single is &quot;Stick to your Vision&quot; an amazing song which uses a sample from the Guess Who song &quot;These Eyes&quot;. This is wicked track where Maestro reminences, and talks about what he is seen over the years, hard times, good times, and about making it the game. There is a real positive vibe to this track, and has good messages in it,like keep on going, work hard, never give up: lyrics like of I seen a lot of valleys/ I seen a lot of peaks/ I take the bitter with the sweet/ victory and defeat make this class a track. Another nice track is &quot;Built to Last&quot;, Ghetto Concept drops in for &quot;Holy Water&quot; a dark track. &quot;416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)&quot; is an upbeat banging club track with an oldschool feel to it. On &quot;Verbal Exodus&quot; Maestro lets people know hes back and stronger then ever, and ready to take on all contenders. Album closes off with &quot;Make this City Stand Still&quot; feat. Snow, a track with an eery beat to it, where Snow drops a nice chorus. To say I feel every track on this album would be wrong, but I feel alot of them, I like the diversity of Maestros music on this cd whether it be deep and meaningful tracks, party tracks, or tracks for the underground. Maestros &quot;Built to Last&quot; is an album I would recommend, especially for fans of Canadian Hiphop.

I have never really paid much attention to Bubba Sparxxx's music aside from watching a couple of videos of his and passed on getting his first album &quot;Dark Days, Bright Nights&quot;. The new lead single for his next album-&quot;Jimmy Mathis/Deliverance&quot; (2003) is one of the nicest songs I have come across this year, beat, chorus (Timbaland)and bubba's lyrics are all impressive. Sparxxx drops lines like &quot;Then they start to question whether you a true talent Or just a redneck substance abuse addict So then you hide away just to try to find your way And now they back to callin you 200 times a day I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance&quot;. Whether he sells 10 mill or not, this track is bound to turn some heads. This first single has made me look forward to hearing his new album which shares same name as track, and checking out his first release.

Guru (AKA Keith Elam,), Gang Starr's MC delivered his first in a series of Hip Hop Jazz related releases with "Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1" (1993). I respect Guru's willingness and drive to provide "An experimental fusion of Jazz and Hip Hop" (as stated on cd). Guru's name is short for "Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal". This twelve-track release (including intro and interlude) is an early notable Rap/Jazz collaboration album. Guru gets things started rhyming on the smooth "Loungin", while Donald Byrd plays the trumpet and piano. Guru collabs with female singer N'Dea Davenport on the semi-decent "When Your Near", and then takes his audience on a "Transit Ride", highlight of this cut for me is Branford Marsalis on the Sax. The chorus and rhymes to "No Time To Play" is a bit to repetitive for my liking. Guru with help from Lonnie Liston Smith on the electric piano provides a standout with "Down The Backstreets", Smith's piano play is outstanding, and Guru's rhymes are grimy. With help from Roy Ayers, Guru then drops "Take A Look" (At Yourself), a track which has Guru kicking knowledge, advising his audience to be accountable, and make moves rather then wait for them to happen. N'Dea Davenport returns for another half decent collaboration with Guru on "Trust Me". Guru reps himself on "Slicker then Most" then collabs with French MC Solaar for "La Bien, Le Mal". The album's closer and longest track is "Sights In The City", backed by a soprano sax and flute Guru drops some on point ghetto stories. I agree with reviewer Ziontrain about Guru not yet displaying the lyrical talent (with a few exceptions) that would be found on the Gang Starr albums. Guru for me will always be best remembered for his work with Premo. Bottom line though I have to admit it is hard for me to have the same reverence for "Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1" as Jazz/Rap collaboration enthusiasts. I recommend checking out this release if you enjoy experimental albums.

Three years ago Rapper Shyne (aka Jamal Barrows) was sentenced to ten years in a state prison for his involvement in a nightclub shooting. At the time he was signed to Bad Boy Records, and P. Diddy who was also at the club the night of the shooting also went to trial, but was cleared of all charges. No possibility of parole till Shyne has served eight+ years of his sentence. Before all this went down Shyne was an up and coming rapper with one successful self titled album released. Although incarcerated Shyne is now signed with Def Jam and has his own label Gangland Records, "Godfather Buried Alive" is a collection of unreleased material Shyne had recorded prior to his sentencing.After a short intro, "Quasi O.G." starts the album off on a hardcore note, Shyne talking about the dark future he expects and his upcoming trial, he saves one line for the father who never acknowledged him a Belize politician. Next comes the album's lead single "More or Less" this is a first class banger which benefits from Kayne West production. Kurupt and Nate Dogg make an appearance on the decent "Behind the Walls" which is followed up by the thugged out "Shyne". Next comes a new freestyle from Shyne who speaks over the phone straight from prison, titled "For the Record" Shyne tears into 50 Cent who originally made a diss towards Shyne. "Martyr" is laced with a sad beat and has Shyne rhyming between his own chorus, while the answer to his question may seem simple to some, others who have hit rock bottom could easily relate to this one. "Jimmy Choo" has Shyne talking to the ladies backed by some soulful Ashanti vocals. Shyne reps himself on two more grimey tracks "Godfather" and "The Gang". Feeling the beat and Shyne lyric's on "Edge" another standout track. "Here with me" is more of the same. My favourite track at the moment is the last one, "Diamonds and Mac 10's" a sick track which benefits from Just Blaze's premium production.People who are interested in buying this album should know beforehand that this is previously unreleased work. Unlike other MC's Shyne does not have the opportunity to provide new tracks, or rework old ones. Because of that some could find that lyrical content is repetitive but its on point with where Shyne was at the time. Some MC's talk about how they live the crime life without actually doing it. Shyne seems the exception, as his life has shown. Overall I like "Godfather Buried Alive", while short it has some standout tracks making it an album I would recommend to Shyne fans.

Dead Prez (M-1 & Stic.man) first album "Lets Get Free" is really political rap, African rap and an album that is different than 90% of the bling bling albums that come out today. Dead Prez bring out meaning, and talk about important issues, you might not agree with some of there opinions and views but they deserve respect for dropping them. On "Im a African" Dead Prez represent their roots, drop their views, on "They Schools" Dead Prez confronts the problems with the Education system. "Hip Hop" is my favorite track on the album,a song to blast in the ride. "Behind Enemy Lines" is a track with a haunting storyline, talks about incarceration of the youth. "Mind Sex" is a love song, and it goes deep, unlike most tracks it appreciates women for the intellect and not just their physical beauty. "Be Healthy" has a wicked beat, and for a track about you are what you eat, its quite good. "Psychology" weaves a painful, sad story. "Happiness" takes you back to feeling good, and the use of acoustic bass, flute,drums add to it. "Animal in Man" is the converted story of the book "Animal Farm" with beats that are addictive. "Its bigger than Hiphop" is a remix of the earlier track, and its just as good if not better. After this theres a break which follows with hidden track "Propaganda" has intresting concepts (Terrorism, Assanitations, Conspiracy Theory) with background singing. In "Lets Get Free" Dead Prez talk about the legal system, the school system, love for women, and freedom and keep the listener entertained throughout....

K-Ci & Jojo's "Love Always" (1997) is a wonderful, memorable and soulful album from the Hailey Brothers. This twelve track release is one of my favourite R & B releases. Executive produced by Jeff Redd, K-Ci & Jojo and Damon Jones. The brothers have amazing vocal abilitys, and shine on there first album as a duo. The albums lead single "All my Life" is the song that sparked my intrest and led me into getting this album, a deep soulful love song about finding ones real love. This track has gotten alot of well deserved recognition, like the video to it as well. Some more love songs that standout for me include the powerful "Last Nights Letter", "Now and Forever"- true love is timeless, and the albums second single "Don't Rush" (Take Love Slowly). The Haileys talk about the other side of love on tracks like "You Bring Me Up" which is about getting played and lied to, "How Many Times" (Will you Let Him Break your Heart)" which has the duo advising woman who are neglected or abused to leave there relationships. The albums closer "How Could You" is the memorable opposite of "All My Life" in that its about losing ones real love as opposed to being with ones real love. It has been six years since I got K-Ci & Jojo's "Love Always, and I still keep it on regular rotation. This is an album I would recommend to anyone who enjoys R & B music at its best.

Da Backwudz debut album is "Wood Work" (2006). Da Backwudz consists of the Atlanta duo of cousin's Big Marc & Sho-Nuff. Da Backwudz start this release off with the bouncy upbeat "Welcome Da Backwudz". The album's first single "Your Gonna Luv Me" feat. Milwaukee Black, is a good track, the first I ever heard from this duo. The next track is the creative "Don't Like The Look Of It (Oompa)" feat. Caz Clay, which incorporates characters from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Killer Mike then drops in for a hustling song with "Gettin 2" which is followed up by the fast paced "Making Money Counting Hundreds". Da Backwudz then change up the formula delivering a smooth cut about a love story on "The World Could Be Yours". The cousins team up with Bohagon and Jeff B for another standout with "Fantastic", especially feeling the production on this cut. A getting laid song in "I'll Do" feat. Jasper follows, then Da Backwudz deliver a short interlude with "Wood Grain". "Whatcha Know' Bout My Life" feat. Goodie Mob's Big Gipp is one of the albums deepest tracks (and my current favorite), a track where Da Backwudz tell their story of growing up and doing whatever they could to survive. Talented singer Sleepy Brown then makes an appearance on "Mama Always Told Me". Da Backwudz then tell some sad stories of abuse, discrimination, suicide and disease on "Feeling Lonely". Da Backwudz shine on "Lock And Load", showing lots of hunger on a track about overcoming life's obstacles - talking on the end of this cut, and dropping some very on point thoughts. Da Backwudz sample soulful singer Sade (King of Sorrow) on "Same Song", a smooth cut about the Rap business, which keeps this reviewer nodding. The duo pay tribute to herb on the laidback "Smoke N Ride". Da Backwudz then close off the album with a great remix of "You Gonna Luv Me" which features appearances from Slim Thug and Nas. On point, deep lyrics, creative concepts, good guest appearances and some outstanding production make Da Backwudz "Wood Work" a strong album worth checking out.

West Coast Rapper/Producer Daz Dillinger delivers an album to checkout with "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta" (2005). The album starts off with the upbeat party track "Thats the Way We Ride" feat. Shorty B. Daz talks about the ladies on the smooth "Do You Think About" while Shelly provides some soulful vocals. George Clinton and Daz collabrate on the Funkadelic "Nuthin Can Stop Us Now", this takes me back to when Ice Cube and Clinton did "Bop Gun" (One Nation). Daz delivers some real lyrics on "Do You Know". The albums high point for me comes in the albums next two tracks. Daz shines on "F*** Dreamin' Tha Same Dream" backed by a strong chorus from Andrea Gray. One message in this track is to reach for your dreams dont expect other people to deliver them. My favourite track on this album is the outstanding "My Mama Said", backed by an addictive beat, Daz rhymes with hunger, providing his own impressive chorus. The fastpaced "My Ambitionz Az A Ridah 2005" follows, then Daz hooks up with Nate Dogg for "Come Close" a feel good love track which has the makings of a commercial single. Daz follows this up with another ballad to the ladies on "Rocc Wit Daz" and then gets sexual on "Bomb Ass Pussy 2005". Daz talks about the struggle to make money on another standout "N**** Gotta Hustle It Up". Daz reps himself and the West on the thugged out title cut "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta" and then closes off the album with his own version of "F*** The Police 2005". Overall "Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP" is a strong release which I highly recommed to Dillinger fans, and fans of West Coast Hip Hop.

Joe's 4th album &quot;Better Days&quot; is soulful and romantic, good for relaxing too. 14 tracks in total. Executive produced by Kedar Massenburg and Joe Thomas. Additional Track production comes from A.Gordon and The Neptunes. Guest appearances are limited to two and come from Shaggy, and Petey Pablo. &quot;Lets stay home Tonight&quot; is a relaxed track about spending alone time with somebody special. Title track is about a girl caught in a tough situation, Joe lays down the story, while keeping it positive. Track uses portion of compositon &quot;Ooh Child&quot; at beginning. &quot;What if a Woman&quot; is a track that puts male female relationships in perspective, concept being what if a woman was just like some men, restless, uncommitted, would you be able to hold it down like some women do. &quot;Alone&quot; is one of my favourite tracks, Joe really describes the feeling of emptyness one feels afer a long relationship. Neptunes produced &quot;Isnt This the World&quot; is another decent track, it doesnt sound like the Neptunes though. &quot;Ghetto Child&quot; feat. Shaggy is an uplifting track about turning a hard situation into a positive one. &quot;Lover's Prayer&quot; is a deep emotional track, and a nice one at that. &quot;Changed Man&quot; follows and is another nice track, where Joe talks about transition and change. &quot;I understand&quot; is about dealing with an abusive relationship and how a women should leave. &quot;World of Girls&quot; is a nice dedication to Women all over the world. Last track &quot;Lets Stay Home&quot; Remix is only track I really dont like on this album, Petey Pablo is not needed. Overall &quot;Better Days&quot; is a good album, and Joe comes across well on majority of tracks, delivering positive, thought provoking, relaxing music that has good replay value.

In may 1998 the then mostly unknown DMX (Earl Simmons)dropped his first album &quot;It's Dark and Hell is Hot&quot; one of the illest album in years in my opinion. DMX's gruff growling vocal flow is distinct, unlike anything I had ever heard before. A then unknown Swizz Beats produced the melodic &quot;Ruff Ryders Anthem&quot; which would blow, and become a common anthem in the hiphop world. Years later still bumping &quot;Let Me Fly&quot; one of my all time favourite hiphop tracks. &quot;How's It Going Down&quot; would also blow, another crossover hit, where X talks to the ladies. Hardcore tracks like &quot;Stop Being Greedy&quot; and &quot;Get at Me Dog&quot; where X talked about street life make this album a great album. &quot;Damien&quot; is an entertaining story telling track. Guest appearances are mostly good on this album, especially those from the Lox who would later sign with Ruff Ryders. DMX's lyrics and flow is exceptionally tight on this album, beats and production is excellent, with a few exceptions not being too par, most of these coming from producers outside the Ruff Ryder family like Irv Gotti. One of the reasons X comes across as strong as he does, is he is real, he isnt just talking about stories he has heard, he is talking about himself, and where hes been, and what he has gone through, this is what makes him one of the best in my opinion and its what makes &quot;Its Dark and Hell is Hot&quot; a Classic.

Tupac Shakurs Sixth album, and first post death album "The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory" was released in November 1996, just two months after his passing. Exit 2pac, enter Makaveli. The album is twelve tracks in all, and contains guest appearances from Makavelis group the Outlawz, Val Young, KC & Jojo, and Tyrone Wrice. Album intro...begins with Pac calling out names, other rappers he was beefing with at the time: Biggie Smalls, Nas, Jay-Z, Mobb Deep. Tupac really lets loose on this album, coming out intense,dark and angry on many of the tracks like "Hail Mary", "Blasphemy" and "Life of an Outlaw". "Toss it Up" feat Kc & Jojo is a nice rap/r&b collab. "To Live and Die" is another more relaxed track a dedication to L.A. and California, although Pac doesnt hesitate to call out his former labelmate Dr. Dre,... "Just Like Daddy" feat. Outlawz is a track about the ladies. "Krazy" is a deep track, where Pac talks about thug life, time passing and getting high. "White Man'z World" and "Me and My Girlfriend" follow and raise the albums tempo even more. "Hold ya Head" is another deep track about death, jail,money, lost homies, Pacs main message though is a positive one, keep yourself up no matter what. Album ends with "Against all the Odds" a powerful closer where Pac takes on all opposition and lets it be known he is ready for war. Tupac was developing more and more as an artist, and this music goes far beyond just anger and calling out names, into deep, powerful, music with an important message. This is definetly an album worth listening to and having in the collection.

Beanie Sigel's 2nd album is "The Reason" (2001) a fourteen track release executive produced by Rocafella's Shawn Carter, Damon Dash & Kareem Burke. Track production comes from Kayne West, Just Blaze, Rick Rock, 88 Keys, B.Parker, No I.D. & Sha-Self. Appearances come from Sigel's Rocafella family: Memphis Bleek, Jay-Z, Freeway, Lil'Chris, Sparks & Rell with additional guest appearances coming from Daz, Kurupt & Scarface. Album starts off strong with "Nothing Like it" a track where Beanie talks about himself, and is backed up by a sick background sample originally performed by the Dynamic Superiors (Ain't Nothin like the Real Thing) which is followed up by the fastpaced lead single "Beanie (Mack B****)". Just Blaze produced "Get Down" samples Quincy Jones "The Lost Man" and Blaze also scratches creating a decent sounding track. The album hits a lull at this point with the next five tracks not standing out, to me they range from average to wack. Then Beanie Sigel shines on the No I.D. produced "Man's World" a track which samples James Browns "It's A Man's , Man's, Man's World". "Tales of a Hustler" feat. Sparks is a deep standout track, about the streets, death and hustling. I like "Mom Praying" feat. Scarface, a track that samples Harvey Scales "It Ain't Gonna Rain On Nobody's Parade But Mine", Beanie Sigel shows alot of love for his Mom and Grandmom on this one. Next track"Still Got Love For You" has Jay-Z and Beanie talking to and about there fathers, parents who were not there for them, Rell also appears, once again another sample is used: Issac Hayes "Ikes Mood I". This albums closer is also my favourite track, the eery sounding "What Your Life Like 2", on this Sigel goes deep while talking about how messed life can become backed by a sample of "Quasimodos Marriage" by A. Costandinos and The Syncophonic Orchestra. I like the use of samples but feel that this albums over sampling (half the tracks) leads to a less original album. "The Reason" has a strong start and finish, some memorable tracks inbetween, and a high number of skippable tracks. Up till this review this cd was gathering dust so I can not honestly recommend it though I can understand why major Roccafella fans and Philadelphia natives would like this.

R & B singer Joe (A.K.A. Joe Lewis Thomas) returns with his sixth album "Ain't Nothing Like Me" (2007). Guest appearances include: Nas, Papoose, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Fabolous and Dre. Production on this release comes from Tim & Bob, Stargate, Ric Rude, Sean Garrett, Bryan Michael Cox, The Underdogs, Cool & Dre, The Beatsmithz & Joshua Thompson. Joe opens up the album with "Get to Know Me" a collaboration with veteran MC Nas, Hip Hop heads will recognize the beat to this cut as it was originally used on Nas album "Stillmatic" on a track called "You're Da Man". For the remake Joe delivers some soulful vocals while Nas drops a few verses, with both artist's getting their game on. Next up is the album's second single "If I Was Your Man" a feel good love track, which has Joe apologizing to a special woman, and making some changes. Joe delivers some impressive smooth vocals, backed by some on point production from Stargate. The next standout is the album's first single "Where You At" which features an appearance from Mixtape MC Papoose, I originally heard this track on a Papoose mixtape and enjoyed it then. Joe shines again once again on the vocals while Papoose makes a late and short appearance. Joe slows the album's tempo down with a slow jam in "My Love", then sings about being infatuated with a beautiful woman on "Go Hard". Joe has a history of collaborating with G-Unit in recent years, Tony Yayo and Young Buck drop in for the tite track "Ain't Nothing Like Me" which falls under skip material for this reviewer. The upbeat "Let's Just Do It" is a slightly better cut which features an appearance from Fabolous. Joe slows things down again on "Feel For You" another love ballad, then teams up with producer/rapper Dre (Of Cool & Dre) on the laidback "Just Relax" which borrows from A Tribe Called Quest. Joe then drops an ultimatum for a woman who thinks "Love is Just A Game" then recollects on another smooth standout in "Life Of the Party". Tim & Bob produced bonus track "That's What I Like" is not to be missed as it is an outstanding cut. Overall this is an enjoyable release, Joe has unique vocals, genuine lyrics and production is generally on point. Borrowing from Hip Hop does not hurt this album - can see that Joe is a fan of the genre. Joe provides a memorable album with "Ain't Nothing Like Me", recommend it to fans and those new to his music.

After a three year hiatus, Chicago singer Carl Thomas returns with his third album "So Much Better" (2007). After listening to R. Kelly's fiasco of an album this week, I was happy to come across this release and find an artist who know's how to make genuine grown up music - avoiding the missteps of his counterparts. Early highlights of this album for me include: the first single "2 Pieces" - which has a soulful Carl Thomas paying tribute to the love of his life and apologizing for past misdeeds, a smooth duet with Lalah Hathaway (Daughter of Donny) on "Thought You Should Know" & and an upbeat love ballad with Brandy on "Somethin' Bout You". "Late Night Rendezvous" is a track which has grown on me some with additional listens, while "So Much Better" is a somber track where Carl Thomas expresses regrets remembering how good life was before a break up. Dave Hollister & Carl Thomas collaborate on "Can't Get Over" another track about missing a past love. Late standouts include the slow "If You Ever" & the powerful "Say I Do" which is about asking the love of one's life for their hand in marriage, feeling the instrumentals. My favourite track on this release is the substantial "Home" - Carl Thomas shines on this outstanding ballad delivering heartfelt vocals, the inclusion of a conversation with his two young children provides additional depth. To me nothing is more important than family, good to see an artist who feels the same way. Bay Area Rapper E-40 & Reggae artist Baby Cham are featured individually on the Remixes of Late Night Rendezvous & Oh No (You Can't Be Serious). "So Much Better" is a quality R & B album worth adding to the collection.

Nas (A.K.A. Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, Nasty Nas, God's Son) returns with his eigth solo album "Hip Hop Is Dead" (2006). I always look forward to album's from Queensbridge's Nas, one of the Rap Game's most consistent and dedicated MC's - it's been twelve year's since he dropped "Illmatic", and I still get play from that album and many other releases in God Son's catalogue. Production on this release come's from L.E.S., Wyldfyer, Scott Storch, Salaam Remi, will.i.am, Stargate, Kayne West, Mark Batson, Chris Webber, Devo, Springsteen, Paul Cho & Dr. Dre. Guest appearances come from: Jay-Z, will.i.am, wife Kelis, Kayne West, Christte Michele, Mark B, Mayfield, Tre Williams, Snoop Dogg, The Game and Marsha Ambrosius of Floetry. My favourite cut on this album is the exceptional Stargate produced "Not Going Back", Nas collaborates with his wife Kelis who provides the the smooth hook, Nas shines like the sun on this joint kicking some real lyrics. The album opener's "Money over B*******" and "You Can't Kill Me" have a hungry sounding Nas on solo ripping up the Mic. The track's that follow have Nas analyzing the Rap game, paying tribute to past slept on MC's and kicking his thoughts on where the modern game is going. Midway some of these track's may not that be appealing musically to people, that was the case for me, partly due to the fact that I am not a fan of Salaam Remi and will.i.am production. The Mark Batson produced "Hold Down The Block" grew on me, and Nas is on point with his storytelling skills on "Blunt Ashes". Tre Williams is an underrated up and coming singer signed to Nas Ill Will imprint, he provides a soulful chorus for the upbeat standout "Let There Be Light". Backed by an impressive Scott Scorch beat Nas and Snoop Dogg deliver a laidback cut with "Play On Playa". Nas embraces getting old on "Can't Forget About You", reflecting on years past while Chrisette Michele sings the chorus. The album's closer has Nas freestyling on "Hope". I would have liked to see Nas "Shine On Em" included on this release, an excellent cut made for the film "Blood Diamond" - maybe it will come out on re-releases. Overall "Hip Hop Is Dead" is another strong release from Nas, one I recommend adding to the collection.

I only recently came across "The Rising Tied" (2005). Being a Hip-Hop fan I like to listen to all different varieties. So it's interesting to see Fort Minor AKA Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda delving into the field. The fact that Black Thought and Common are featured on this release made checking this one out all the more appealing. The album's first full-length track is a standout, Shinoda & Styles of Beyond collaborate well over a nice instrumental. "Right Now" follows, I like the conceptual idea of this cut, which has Shinoda, Black Thought and Styles of Beyond dropping rhymes and catching a moment in time. The show stealer for me is track six, up and coming singer Holly Brook delivers some exceptional vocals on the deep "Where'd You Go", while Shinoda drops some on point rhymes, creating a memorable track. Common and Styles of Beyond are featured on "Back Home", production on this cut is simply lackluster." Believe Me" feat. Bobo & Styles of Beyond is decent, while singer John Legend helps put some life into the "High Road". Kenna, Jonah Matranga and Styles Of Beyond team up with Shinoda for the solid "Red To Black". The album closes off on a decent note, as Kenna and Shinoda collaborate for "The Hard Way". What I enjoyed about this album is it's interesting to see an artist branching out into another field of music. It takes some guts to do that. I personally don't think Mike Shinoda is very entertaining as an MC, his forgettable lyrics and flow are very average and I found myself listening to the production more. On the other hand the guest spots and tight production made "The Rising Tide" worthwhile. 3.5.

A-Alikes debut album is "I Eat, You Eat" (2006). The A-Alikes duo of Ness (AKA Illuminessence) & K (AKA Karaam) originally met up in Florida, and live in Brooklyn. Affiliates of Dead Prez the duo provide a seventeen-track release with appearances from M-1 & Stic.Man of Dead Prez, Afayah, I.G., Bilal, Maya Azucena & Nimrod . After the intro A-Alikes open up the album with the strong "Greyhound", talking about being on the grind and evading the police. The duo rhyme about their nothing to lose outlook on "We Hungry" feat. I.G., while describing life on the streets. M-1 & Stic.Man drop in for "Till We Free" a track about doing whatever it takes to make it. Ness & K shine on "They Want To Murder Me" delivering a thugged out cut where A-Alikes rhyme about living a day to day existence where they have to watch out for trigger happy cops, making reference to people they know who have died at the hands of the police. "Protocal" is a track where the A-Alikes remind their audience to remember their rights and make the right decisions. Singer Bilal appears on "What You Give" , which is followed up by "What's Your Politic" a track where they ask their audience what's their take on the world while giving their own perspective. On "Our Story", A-Alikes talk about their ambitions and the road they have taken moving away from hustling to making music, and the love and respect they have for each other while singer Mary Azucena drops some smooth vocals. Backed by some memorable production the A-Alikes provide an excellent cut with "Share" feat. Afayah , a track where they pay tribute to each other and the friendship they have. Backed by some ominous sounding production A-Alikes drops a banger with "More then Music". Stic.Man of Dead Prez drops in for the last three tracks. These cuts are the highlight of the album for me as I am a big Dead Prez fan. A-Alikes and Stic.Man provide an outstanding track with "Diary of A G". My favorite track on this album is "Child Of The Street", Stic.Man laces the cut with a exceptional soulful chorus while the A-Alikes deliver some on point rhymes. The album's powerful closer "Heaven On Earth" has Stic.Man and A-Alikes appreciating life itself while dropping memorable lines like "Heaven is A State of Mind, Heaven is what you make it and Hell is what you are going to go through to get there". A-Alikes "I Eat, You Eat" is an impressive release, the duo provide a substantial album worth checking out.

Musiq Soulchild (A.K.A. Musiq, Taalib Johnson) debut album "Aijuswanaseing" (2000) is a solid release from a talented musician. After the introduction the Philadelphia singer opens up this release with a smooth cut in "Girl Next Door", Musiq and Ayana sing soulfully away in what turns out to be an excellent track. This is a feel good joint, with good replay value."You And Me" is about keeping a relationship going no matter what obstacles get in the way. Musiq keep things going well with another decent track in the single "Just Friends" (Sunny). Musiq then changes the scenario singing about losing a girl on "Mary Go Around" and reminisces on "143". Musiq provides an exceptional track while believing in "Love", and stating how the word is misused. The later part of the album has some skip material, though their are a few standouts. Musiq sings about avoiding a relationship with an under age girl on "Seventeen, while lacing the heartfelt "Popraratzi" with an addictive chorus asking for one more chance to make things right. Musiq Soulchild provides an enjoyable release with "Aijuwanaseing" (I Just Wanna Sing). 3.5.

Tupac Shakur will always be my favorite artist. I have followed his music from the very beginning, original albums, soundtracks, post death albums and now to "Nu Mixxx Klazzics". I have enjoyed all the albums, and have always found that any new music by Pac is music I want to hear and music that I will buy. Still I was skeptical about this, this is not new music at all- just remixes. In the end it comes down to me that this is still Pac lyrically (5/5) and when you have all his work like I do, you still check out the remixes. How I feel about them track by track:2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted Nu Mixx - Tupac & Snoop's classic collabo redone with Crooked I in Snoops place. Its not 1/20th as good as the original. I see potential in Crooked I as an artist not on this track though. The beat is worse. The question to ask Death Row is how long will Crooked I fans have to wait for his debut album to come out..(Crooked I is not the next Snoop or the next Pac, he is simply himself and his placement on his track was a mistake by Death Row in my opinion)How Do You Want It Nu Mixx - Featuring KC & JoJo- This remix is not near as good as the original. The beat and flute sounding instrument does jack for me.Hail Mary Nu Mixx - Featuring The Outlawz - You cant change that dope dark beat and replace it with this light one and expect it to be any better.Life Goes On Nu Mixx- The original is one of my favourite 2pac tracks. The beat to the original had more depth, the beat to this one does not. The remix is not as good, but its the first remix I enjoy on this.All Eyez On Me Nu Mixx - Featuring Syke- new beat is powerful and different, I like it.Heartz Of Men Nu Mixx- Another track where the remix does very little for me. Prefer the original by far.Toss It Up Nu Mixx - Featuring Danny Boy, Aaron Hall, KC &JoJo- Same goes for this one, this new beat is average, prefer the original.Hit Em Up Nu Mixx - Featuring The Outlawz- The beat is too light once again, the original dark beat works best on one of the biggest diss tracks of all time. Death Row should know better.Never Had A Friend Like Me Nu Mixx- The new beat for the song that was originally on Gridlock is decent. This may be one track that people who have not followed pac extensively have not come across before, so remixing it makes some sense.Ambitionz Az A Ridah Nu Mixx- I like this new beat, of course as with others I prefer the original.Part of me feels like giving this album a high rating because I love Pac's music, and even when they change the beats, lyrically (5/5) its still him. And I have also enjoyed his post death albums- even though they have remixes there has always been unreleased material, and the mixes have been crafted very carefully on those albums. But my rating is two, because Death Row does little to enhance his music if anything they provide beats which are for the most part average or low quality (with a few exceptions), in comparison to the originals. These remixes could have been alot better, there could/should of been more of them and there is still unreleased Tupac material out which should take precident to any remixes in my opinion. I would recommend purchasing any of 2Pac's previous work over this and then if your a big fan like myself decide for yourself by listening to it first. R.I.P. Tupac Shakur.

Recently reading an article on Bone Thugs-N-Harmony one particular line stood out "Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony are and will be the only artist in history to have collaborated with Big Pun, Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, and 2Pac". The prolific Cleveland group was formed in 1990, and discovered by by the late Eazy-E, and have a large discography including underground, compilation, solo and studio album's. In 2007 the group returns as a trio - Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Wish Bone (Bizzy Bone parted ways with the group, Flesh-N-Bone is an original member who remains incarcerated) with "Strength & Loyalty" a fourteen track release executive produced by Swizz Beatz which features guest appearances from: Akon, Swizz Beatz, Mariah Carey, Twista, Yolanda Adams, The Game, Will.i.am & Felecia. Bone Thugs-N-Harmony open the album up lacing "Flow Motion" with their trademark fast paced flow. Backed by some distinct production from Swizz Beatz the group then provides a cut to bang in the whip with "Bumps In The Trunk". The trio rhyme backed by some creative production/sampling on "Wind Blow", which lead's up the album's first single "I Tried" a collaboration with R & B singer & producer Akon. This is one of my favourite track's of this year, Bone Thugs shine on this cut delivering some outstanding lyrics backed by Akon's exceptional chorus. A quality track which any fan of Hip Hop can enjoy, and one of the few radio jams I like hearing over and over again. "Lil Love" is the album's second single, a commercially friendly track which features Mariah Carey and Bow Wow. "C-Town" is another standout, as Bone Thugs-N-Harmony team up with Twista who clears up any misconceptions of beef between Hip Hop's fastest flowing artist's while Bone Thugs provide an on point chorus. Gospel Singer Yolanda Williams drops in for "Order My Steps" (Dear Lord), in which an introspective Bone Thugs talk to and about God backed by Williams vocals. The Black Eyes Pea's Will.iam & Game appear on the bland "Streets" which is followed up by hard hitting track's "9MM" & "Gun Blast" which sound like the kind of material Bone Thugs delivered back in the day. Upbeat ride dedicated "Candy Paint" & "So Good So Right" follow. On the later track Bone Thugs-N-Harmony reflect on their musical journey, the departure of Bizzy Bone, backed by Felecia who provides the chorus. "Same Story" is a somber track, where Bone Thug's rhyme about the struggles people face worldwide. Akon and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony reunite for the excellent closer in "Never Forget Me" another quality track. To be honest I have never been a huge Bone Thug's fan but enjoyed this release. Bone Thug's willingness to diversify and collaborate with other artist's (Akon especially) definitely benefits this album. Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony provide an album that old and new fan's alike can enjoy with "Strength & Loyalty", recommended for the collection.

The special edition of Lyfe Jennings "268-192" (2005) like the original is excellent. This album really impressed me; Lyfe's a gifted singer, with a story worth listening to. After a short intro and interlude, Lyfe delivers the goods with the outstanding "Must Be Nice", an addictive melody that this reviewer can play over and over. The follow up cut "The Way I Feel About You" is smooth and vibes well. Lyfe delves deeper on tracks like "She Got Kids", "Hypothetically" and "Smile" providing substantial & heartfelt music. "Greedy" is about a woman who uses her own seed, to gain revenge while "Stick Up Kid" has Lyfe recalling his days of being a thug. Lyfe challenges the myth that men shouldn't "Cry" with a deep slow track. On the upbeat "My Life", Lyfe sings about being poor and happy during the toughest of times and ends this track with some inspirational words. The closing track is my favourite, in an album full of memorable tracks "Let's Do This Right" a dedication to the incarcerated stands out the most for me. Lyfe knows what its like to be locked down, and shines like the sun while singing this one. Bonus material, includes remixes of "Hypothetically" feat. Fantasia and "Must Be Nice", loving the Nas addition on the later cut, and the DVD is entertaining. I respect how Lyfe has turned his life around (ten years in prison) and come up on top, and in turn inspires other people to through his singing and spoken word interludes. I am really looking forward to hearing his next album, he appears on LL Cool J's new album on a joint called "Freeze" dropping next week. I highly recommend adding Lyfe's diamond "268-192" to the collection.

213 provide an entertaining album with "The Hard Way" (2004). The trio of Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg and Warren G have all individually been known for delivering some memorable collabrations over the years, so I have been looking forward to seeing what they would be like collectively on their debut full length album. Overall this is a strong album with a lot of standout tracks. The early tracks don't grab my attention that much, including the lead single. The first real standout for me is "Wait A Minute", all of 213 come through nicely backed by a unique and addictive beat. The next track is my favourite on this album the Kayne West produced "Another Summer", this really captures the feeling of this season, an excellent feel good track, I agree with Snoop this is a summertime anthem. 213 then talk about the "Ups & Downs" of the Rap game, and staying true. I think we can all relate with the standout "Gotta Find a Way", we all need to get paid. "Joystick" has an old school feel to it like the earlier "Sassy Ways", it has got an 80's sounding feel to it with a humorous sex concept. After a Rick James (R.I.P.) skit, 213 drop the laidback "Mary Jane". Another memorable track is the outstanding "MLK", love the way this one flows. 213 talk to and about some ladies on "Give It Up" while giving thanks and showing love to family and friends on the mellow "Appreciation". I first heard the beat to "So Fly" on a track from 50 Cent's EP "Power of the Dolla" and Monica used it later with her hit single. Usually I don't like it when beats get reused, primarily because artists dont always improve the track. 213 create the exception, delivering a premium track, Snoop and Warren G rhyme well and Nate Dogg shines on this closer. I like the chemistry that these three have and its nice to see a West Coast album getting some attention in a time where Rap seems to be focused everywhere else. I recommend checking this one out. 213 have succeeded in creating a nice late summertime with "The Hard Way".

Nas (Nasir Jones) "Lost Tapes" (2002) is a compilation album of eleven unreleased Nas tracks (+1 bonus track). The first thing I thought when listening to this album was why have these dope tracks not come out, after that my next thought was dam I am glad this album dropped. "Doo Rags" is the albums first track,and has Nas reminiscing about the 80s and showing he still has alot of love for life, track has a very nice piano-based loop. "Doo Rags" is a classic Nas track, one of my all time favourites now. Next comes the first of two alchemist produced tracks "My Way" which has Nas talking about making it in the game and uses simple but effective chorus "I did it my way", this is more of a thugged out track, which contains a recollection of the death of his close friend Ill Will. The other Alchemist track is "No ideas Original"."U Gotta Love It" uses a beat similar to another track off one of his albums and is a track about thug life. "Nothing lasts forever" is a track with the main message being enjoy life for the moment whoever you are, and Nas talks about the benefits of making it in the game, another blazing track. "Blaze a 50" and "Everybody's Crazy" have Nas thug storytelling, both are nice. Next comes another standout track called "Purple", I like this track because Nas from early on comes real with statements like "I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers" and follows it up by addressing the state of the hood, talking about all the men in prison,loyalty and treachery, to a sad beat, Nas goes real deep on this one. On "Drunk by Myself" Nas talks about losing close friends, having haters, and going solo, another ill track. Last tracks are dedicated to Nas's family, first is "Poppa was a Playa" which has Nas talking about his pops, and the life he led when Nas was growing up, another track with a sick beat. Bonus track is called "Fetus" and has Nas talking about his moms and growing up. This is one of my favourite Nas albums, really glad he did release this one as its a gem, bound to be slept on as it had less promotion then other albums. Nas drops original and memorable music on "Lost Tapes" highly recommend getting this album.

M-1 (AKA Mutulu Olugabala) delivers his debut solo album with "Confidential" (2006). I have been following Dead Prez since I heard their premium debut album "Lets Get Free". M-1 opens this release with the outstanding "One Side" (The Anthem). M-1 and his Dead Prez partner Sticman team up for their only collaboration with the solid "Early". M-1 excels on the exceptional "Land Bread and Housing" feat. My Momma & singer Raye he delivers some heartfelt lyrics. Scrap Daddy then drops in for the banging "For You". The albums title track "Confidential" is another excellent track, M-1 rhymes over a dope laidback beat, while singer Raye delivers some smooth vocals. M-1 enlists A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip & singer Cassandra Wilson for the beautiful standout "Love You Can't Borrow". "5 Elements" opens with M-1 quoting Bruce Lee, in a track about discipline, which is similar to "50 In The Clip", found on Dead Prez last album. "Gunslinger" is an interlude of sorts, a funny sounding one at that. M-1, Styles P of the Lox & Bazaar Royale hook up for the strong "Comrade's Call". Two experimental sounding cuts follow then M-1 & Ghostface tag team "Been Through", while singer Raye provides more smooth vocals. M-1 lyrics on the moving upbeat single "Til We Get There" are off the hook; he takes things to a whole another level, Somalian Rapper Knaan & singer Stori James shine. This track is full of positive messages and quotables, ultimately it's about being together, accepting each other's differences and realizing we all are human and are stronger when we accept and love each other and work together. In order to achieve that goal solidarity is needed. M-1 closes the album off with "Too Smart" kicking rhyme after rhyme backed by his own chorus, and then finishes this release off talking about Assatta Shakur & other revolutionaries and the politics and ideology of his movement. M-1 delivers an excellent album with "Confidential", full of memorable lyrics, premium collaborations and tight production. Highly recommend checking out this release.

Can't say I am impressed at all by "Bad Boy's 10th Anniversary: The Hits" (2004). Sure there are some memorable tracks here (Big Poppa, Whoa, I'll Be Missing You) but what relation do 50 Cent and Lloyd Banks have to a Bad Boy Anniversary album. What happened to Bad Boy's recent talent: Black Rob, G.Dep etc. These are the artists that deserve more albums, not wack acts like Loon and Da Band. In the end I guess its all about making money, this release being a fine example. P. Diddy chose to release it March 9th, which is also the day the late great Notorious was killed. A few Biggie tracks are on this release, but there not much of a real representation of his best work in my opinion. The Hits? hell no. This reviewer is going to calm down and listen to "Ready to Die" and "Life After Death" the two greatest releases Bad Boy ever made. Then I might hit up on some of Black Rob's "Life Story" and even Shyne's self titled album (yeah the guy P. Diddy left in prison) and remember what Bad Boy Records used to be.

A Tribe Called Quest's lead MC Q-Tip (A.K.A. Jonathan Davis, Kamaal Ibn John Fareed) has been working to get ownership of the masters for his unreleased solo album "Kamaal The Abstract" (2002). This one never made it to the shelves as a misguided Arista Records thought it was "un-commercial". While creating a catalogue of ATCQ's group & solo releases I was happy to find out about this nine track release, a 2001 advance/promo which I found could be listened to on the web. Listening to this album is a highly enjoyable experience as Q-Tip fills this release with a creative assortment of Hip-Hop, Jazz & Alternative Rock instrumentals which make every track distinct. Great music to chill too. Early track's like "Feeling","Do You Dig U?" & "A Million Times" vibe well, Queen's Q-Tip keeps his lyrical presence limited, instead letting the memorable instrumentals (live drums, guitar, organ, saxophone, electric piano, trumpets, flute) hold their own as they do throughout this release. Q-Tip sings away on "Blue Girl" which is laced with more on point instrumentals, guitar, piano etc. "Barely In Love" vibes with good intentions and hand claps. Q-Tip rhymes about one of women's most loved possessions on "Heels" & looks to raise the bar on "Abstractionisms". The short "Caring" features some smooth female vocals and chilled out piano beats. The highlight of this album for me is the closing track "Even If It So", Q-Tip shines on this joint telling the story of a single mum's hustle to make a living and create a better life, backed by some outstanding instrumentals - love the trumpets. Found myself bumping my Tribe album's more recently, the infusion of Hip Hop and Jazz has never been done so well, finding this short but sweet release was like a breath of fresh air. Q-Tip has another unreleased album "Live at the Renaissance", it's rumored to be released soon as "The Renaissance", hopefully "Kamaal the Abstract" sees the light of day soon too, highly recommend checking out this release if you can find it.

Outkast's fourth album &quot;Stankonia&quot; (2000) is yet another great album from Rap's most consistent duo. Andre and Big Boi continued in being experimental, while delivering music for people who enjoy many different music genres. &quot;Gasoline Dreams&quot; is a powerful track that starts the album off strong, and has Outkast dropping some dark rhymes. &quot;So Fresh, So Clean&quot; is an early light hearted track, while &quot;Ms. Jackson&quot; is an outstanding track, with meaningful lyrics and an impressive chorus that stays inside ones head. Definetly feeling &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;, the chorus, instrumental and Outkast rhymes are all on point. The fastpaced, frenetic &quot;B.O.B.&quot; (Bombs over Baghdad) is a unique track that blends some sick rhymes with some crazy beats. Soulful singer Erykah Badu drops in for another standout &quot;Humble Mumble&quot; and laidback deep &quot;Toilet Tisha&quot; feat. Goodie Mob flows through nicely. &quot;Slum Beautiful&quot; is another memorable track, on an album full of them. The album closes off with the albums longest track the title track &quot;Stankonia&quot;. I have to say seven skits is to much, but thankfully the music between those tracks makes up for that.

Prodigy's solo debut "H.N.I.C" is harcore hiphop at its best."Genesis" is a nice quick starting track where P spits to a dope beat, "What you Rep" has Nore of CNN, and is a nice collab which has P talking about QB and Nore Iraq. Next comes the title track of the album "Keep It Thoro" its straight solid and has a nice replay value to it. "Infamous Minded" featuring Big Noyd has got ill beat. On "Wanna Be Thugs" Prodigy and Havoc, come out strong, showing true mobb form. Next track is called "Three" feat Cormega, and is another ill collabo. In "Trials of Love" P takes a minute aside to talk about relationships. "H.N.I.C" and "Veterans Memorial" keep the album formula of ill beats, matched with Prodigys memorable flow. "Veterans Memorial" is a dedication to lost friends and family, and is deep. "Y.B.E." feat B.G is a smooth joint, with piano tinges. "Diamond" shows the potential of Bars and Hooks, the group that is signed on Mobbs label. The last track is called "You Can Never feel my Pain", on it Prodigy talks about his real life illness (sickle Cell Anemia) and life, and this without a doubt is Prodigy at his realist and deepist. H.N.I.C is classic, real and harcore hiphop at its best.

Busta Rhymes (Trevor Tahiem Smith, Jr.) seventh solo album is "The Big Bang" (2006) a fifteen track release which includes guest appearances from Q-Tip, Marsha, Missy Elliot, Swizz Beatz, Stevie Wonder, Rick James, Chauncey Black, Raekwon, Kelis, will.i.am, Nas, Mr. Porter and Latoiya Williams. Production comes from Dr. Dre, Mark Batson, Swizz Beatz, DJ Scratch, Sha Money XL, DJ Green Lantern, J Dilla (R.I.P.), Eric Sermon, will.i.am., Denaun Porter, Timbaland and Jelly Roll. Busta opens the album up collaborating with Marsha of Floetry and A Tribe Called Quest's lead MC Q-Tip on "Get You Some", all three come on point providing a stellar introduction backed by some tight Dr. Dre/Mark Batson production. First time I heard "Touch It" I knew it would be a club banger, Busta rhymes with a fast flow backed by Swizz Beatz distinct production. This cut has also spawned a popular remix, which has appearances from Mary J. Blige, Rah Digga, Missy Elliott, Lloyd Banks, Papoose & DMX. Next up Busta teams up with Missy Elliot for "This is How We Do It Over Here". Busta and Swizz represent their city with pride on "New York S***" a track which NY catz are bound to be bumping. One of the album's deepest track follows Busta takes his audience through his life talking about his parents, trials and tribulations on "Been Through The Storm", while Stevie Wonder soulfully sings, one of my favorite part's of this cut is when the orchestra drops in around the three minute mark to close off an impressive track. Busta Rhymes samples the late Rick James for "In The Ghetto" then hooks up with Marsha of Floetry again for the smooth "Cocaina". My favorite track on this album is "You Can't Hold A Torch", Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip and Chauncey Black collab for a quality head nodder about fronting MC's and how the Rap game has changed and is lacking love. One of the real highlights of this album for me is the return of Q-Tip, Busta and Q have a natural chemistry which goes back to the ATCQ days. The Wu's Raekwon and Busta provide another solid cut with "Goldmine". The albums second single "I Love My B****" has Busta, Kelis and the Black Eyed Peas will.i.am. dropping a relationship type cut which falls under skip material for me. Dr. Dre provides another excellent beat for "Don't Get Carried Away" a fastpaced cut, which Busta and Nas rip up. Denaun Porter (of D-12) produces and appears on the next track "They're Out To Get Me" a track where Busta talks about fake friends. Busta pays tribute to a fine woman on "Ill Do It All" while LaToiya Williams sings passionately. The album's closer is the ominous "Legend of The Fall Offs", Busta addresses what its like when stardom ends. Busta Rhymes provides an impressive album with his latest release "The Big Bang", tight and distinct production, good appearances and on point rhymes make this album worth checking out.

The soundtrack for the 2001 romantic movie &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot; which starred Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas is a good one. The songs flowed well with the theme of the movie, also showcased some of R&amp;Bs nicest singers. However the track that made me buy this album is not an R &amp; B track. Instead its a hiphop track, with R &amp; B Vocals and the albums theme song, this track is &quot;Ballad of Fire Starr&quot; by Fredro Starr (1/3 Onyx).This track is an amazing track about growing up hard, and making it through the trials and tribulations of life. The next standout track is KC &amp; Jojos &quot;Crazy&quot; this is an R&amp;B song to remember about love, that makes you sing along. Donnel Jones &quot;You Know whats Up&quot;, Kevin Edmonds &quot;Move it Slow&quot; and Montell Jordans &quot;Get it on Tonite&quot; are all good tracks that make this soundtrack an enjoyable listening experience. 112's &quot;Only You&quot; Feat. Notorious B.I.G. is another decent track, but not as good as I expected. There are some skippable tracks on this soundtrack, but there are skippable tracks on every soundtrack, so &quot;Save the Last Dance Soundtrack&quot; comes out as one of the nicer ones for me, reflecting the movie well.

A week after the 9th anniversary of Tupac Shakur's death we see the release of "Poetry and Music Vol. 2" (2005) a collection of songs made by artists who were inspired by Tupac's life and poetry. Bone Thugs and Harmony start things off with the strong "Power of the Smile", while Celina and Talib Kweli make their own contributions. The first real standout for me has Ludacris reciting an original Tupac Poem "In the Depths of Solitude" and giving his own interpretation of Pac's words. Talented singer Lyfe Jennings then delivers the deep "Movin On". Memphis Bleek appears on the one track, which features Pac vocals (a chorus) called "Life Through My Eyes". Pac's brethren the Outlawz provide "When Ur heart Turns Cold'. Another standout that I am feeling is Boot Camp Clik's "Where there is a Will" a positive track that vibes real well. Those who followed Pac's early days know he entered the rap game with the Digital Underground, the groups leader Shock G provides the heartfelt "And 2tommorow". My favourite track on this release is Dead Prez diamond "If I fail", love and relate to the lyrics of this track like "If I fail then I rise like a phoenix before your eyes out the ashes and from the dirt..." an exceptional joint. "Poetry and Music Vol. 2"is an enjoyable release worth picking up, a group of artists ranging from members of Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts to some of Rap's elite provide heartfelt and substantial music.

Wordsworth's debut album "Mirror Music" (2004) is a strong release which is bound to be slept on. Wordsworth shines lyrically throughout this album delivering music with substance and meaning backed by some solid production. Brooklyn's Wordsworth starts the album talking life in his hood on "What We Gon'". Words talks about how his view on women has changed and how he used to be with women on "Trust". Another early standout is "Be A Man", a track about surviving and growing up. Words former partner in Rhyme Punchline drops in for the albums first collabration "Not Fair". My favourite track at the moment is the outstanding "Shoulder", love the sad beat (Frequency), rhymes and chorus to this cut. Kenn Starr and Oddisee drop in for "Head High" a track about staying up and overcoming. "Guardian Angel" is about living life to its fullest, cuz like Words says there "aint no second chance for a first impression". Words continues to talk about real life situations on "Don't Go" which features a unique sounding chorus from Adanita Ross. One of the best albums of 2004 has come from Masta Ace (A Long Hot Summer) who makes an appearance with Justin Time on "Evol" a track about the love/hate relationship in the Rap Game and what sales mean in the industry. Another standout is "Run" a track where Words talks about running from the law. One of the deepest tracks is "Unity", Meleni soulfully sings and Words drops some memorable verses. On "Gonna Be" Wordsworth gets introspective, talking about touring and the struggle to make a living in the Rap game. Bonus tracks "On Your Feet" and "The Way" close off the album. I recommend this album to people who enjoy genuine reality rap, and introspective music from an intelligent MC.

Maroon 5 (Adam Levine, James Valentine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden, Matt Flynn) return with their sophomore studio album "It Won't Be Soon Before Long" (2007). The Los Angeles group propelled themselves to stardom with their groundbreaking studio debut "Songs About Jane" (2002). I was not surprised to see their cd being sold at Starbuck's. People reading this review should know I generally listen to different music genres. The first single "Makes Me Wonder" is an upbeat catchy tune which has blown up on the radio. My personal favorite Maroon 5 track is "She Will Be Loved" - this album does not have anything that can compare with the track. Attempts are made in decent track's like "Won't Go Home Without You" and "Nothing Lasts Forever" (which uses the same Adam Levine chorus from his collaboration with Kayne West on "Heard Em Say"). I agree with reviewer A.D.D. who stated "The new disc is washed, scrubbed and polished to the point where you just want to hear some raw emotion out of Levine's voice but you never do". This album has been crafted to sell, and has a lot of material which will appeal to mainstream audiences. I can see how some people would find it unfair to compare this album to the last instead stating that is the way musical progression goes. I personally prefer a more low key Maroon 5, without all the glitz and fine tuning - less Hollywood, more heart. Overall "It Won't Be Soon Before Long" is a decent release worth checking out.

The Lox (Jadakiss, Styles, Sheek) second album &quot;We are the Streets&quot; is another nice album from hiphops hottest trio. 2000 saw the Lox leave Bad Boy Entertainment and join The Ruff Ryders, and it was a good move. Executive Production comes from Dee &amp; Waah with track production from Swizz Beats, P.K., DJ Premier and Timbaland. Guest Appearances are limited to Kasino, Drag-on, Swizz Beats and Eve. After a funny introduction, album starts strong with &quot;F*** You&quot;, followed by &quot;Can I live&quot; feat. Kasino. &quot;Wild Out&quot; is the lead single for the album (Swizz Beats), and has the Lox spitting nice lyrics, while professing loyalty to there new crew. My favourite track is &quot;Regonize&quot; which is laced with ill beats courtesy of DJ Premier, Jada comes out really strong with lines likes &quot;Too hard for MTV, not Black enough for BET&quot;, Sheek and Styles follow through with ill lines. &quot;Yall f***** up Now&quot; and &quot;U told me&quot; feat. Eve follow and are nice banging tracks, with sick beats courtesy of Swizz. &quot;Ryde or Die B****&quot; is an upbeat track (Timbaland), has the Lox talking about the ladies. Album ends with track that shares title name, and has the Lox, giving their oath of loyalty to Ruff Ryders while putting Bad Boy down a bit. One year later, Jada and Styles have dropped banging solo albums, and Sheek has his solo on the way, things are definetly looking up for one of hiphops nicest groups. Production on this album was good, Swizz beats does well on beats, and Premiers touch is golden. &quot;We are the Streets&quot; shows that the Lox have made alot of progression from &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot;, and leaves you looking forward to there next album.

Jaheim's (J.Hoaglan) sophomore album &quot;Still Ghetto&quot; (2002) is an uplifting album to enjoy. Jaheim is blessed with a wonderful, soulful voice which shines through on this release. Jaheim has shown alot love for Hip Hop so it makes sense that he have Kay Gee (formerly of Naughty by Nature) looking after alot of the production on this. The lead single is the inspirational &quot;Fabulous&quot; which is about staying positive and making it through the hardest of times. I like this track, The Rayne's guest appearance is good and having the children sing the chorus adds a different feel to the track. Next two tracks are standout, &quot;Diamond In Da Ruff&quot; and &quot;Put that Woman First&quot; are about appreciating ones lady. Other early songs like &quot;Me and My B****&quot; and &quot;Let's Talk About It&quot; follow through well. &quot;Long as I Live&quot; is about real love, marriage and commitment. Jaheim goes real deep on &quot;Everywhere I Am&quot; a beautiful tribute to his mom, a song where you can really feel his genuine love. Mary J and Jaheim drop a memorable collabration on &quot;Beauty and a Thug&quot;. Slow love song &quot;Special Lady&quot; is another track I like. A few tracks particularly the ones at the end- are more filler material for me. However the majority of the tracks are memorable with good reply value. &quot;Still Ghetto&quot; is another Jaheim album to enjoy, one I recommend checking out.

The Outlawz (Kastro, Young Noble and E.D.I.) latest release "Outlaw 4 Life: 2005 A.P" is an album worth checking out. Having followed these rappers since the days they were youngsters making appearances on Pac albums, I am happy to see them back at it delivering quality reality rap and growing as artists. Production is stellar throughout. The albums opener is the strong "Real Talk", a track that lives up to its name as the Outlawz deliver some memorable lyrics. More solid tracks follow with "Can't Turn Back" and "Celebrate" feat. TQ, cuts about overcoming life's challenges. Bun B brings some southern flavor on "Big Ballin'" while honorary Outlaw Stormey makes his first appearance. Another standout track is "These are the Times" feat. Khujo & Malachi, a track about love, family and looking out for those close to you. The Lawz go deep on the outstanding "Ghetto Gospel Pt. 2" and "Smilin Faces" feat. Lana. The Outlawz shine again on "Don't Get It", like the way the beat and vocals rise on this cut. On "Listen to Me", the Outlawz reflect on their youth and deliver a positive message for those who are coming up now. My favorite track is the album's closer, "Losin My Mind" feat. Stormey is an outstanding cut, the kind of track you blast in the ride. This is my favorite Outlaw album since "Still I Rise" and I feel it's there most complete effort. The Outlawz have grown as MC's, and developed more distinct identies and flows, what really stands out for me though are there lyrics which are on point, substantial and heartfelt. Being an independent label is hard, but I respect the Outlawz all the more for going this route and recommend this release.

Puff Daddys first album "No Way Out" was a major commerical success. So What? you say, and I agree with you, just because an album does well commercially doesnt mean its any good. However in this case I have to say this is an exception. Album starts with "Victory" feat. Notorious B.I.G. (R.I.P.), and is a strong wicked introduction. "Been Around the World" feat. Maseis that commerical track thats really for the ladies, maybe the kids, but not the hardcore hiphop heads. On "What You Gonna Do"Puffy talks about Death. "Do you know" has Puff talking about his life, rise in the game , and has a dope relaxed beat, mixed with nice female vocals. "I love you Baby" was one of the first introductions to Black Rob and its a good one. Black Rob has got this grimy ill sound, and toghther with Puff makes this a ill track. "Its all about the Benjamins" (Remix) is an adrenaline laced track, that gets you pumped. On "Pain" Puffy talks about the death of his father, shysty women and Pain that you wouldnt wish on anyone. "Ill be Missing You" feat. Faith Evans (Wife of Notorious) is a deep song made in memory and tribute of his close friend, and legendary MC Biggie Smalls and also dedictated to anyone whos ever lost someone close. This track is beautiful, any yeah I know thats not a hiphop word, but its the best description I can give it. Album ends with another energetic track "Can't Nobody Hold me Down" feat. Mase which is alright but probably should of been placed earlier in the album. There is truth in that Puffy, these days known as Pdiddy is that cat people love to hate, all the same you have to respect what hes done, whether you like him or not.

The Lox's debut album "Money, Power & Respect" (1998) introduced the Hip Hop world to the Yonkers trio of Jadakiss, Styles & Sheek. Nowadays everyone knows the Lox of Ruff Ryder acclaim, artists who have dropped a solid follow up album, nice solo albums, and made numerous guest appearances on some of the biggest rap releases in recent years while maintaining there street crediblity by dropping regular mixtapes. Back in 98 they were far less known and were just trying to make it in the game. "Money, Power & Respect" is executive produced by Sean Combs (Puffy, P.Diddy) and has guest appearances from DMX, Lil Kim, Carl Thomas & Kelly Price. Puff Daddy makes appearances throughout album usually talking more then rapping. Album has intro and four interludes, making it a sixteen track release. First track "Livin' the Life" is good starter, has a hungry Lox talking about street life. Albums title track and first single is blazing, laced with a sick beat, Lox members drop some ill verses, and guest appearances from Lil Kim (chorus) and DMX are excellent. Another standout track is "Let's Start Rap Over" feat. Carl Thomas, a track that has the trio reminiscing and talking about the Rap Game, over a sick beat, with very nice vocals from R & B singer Carl Thomas. On "I Wanna Thank You" feat. Kelly Price, Lox talk about life,death and street life to a sad sounding beat, while Kelly Price and P. Diddy thank god. Jadakiss and Styles display there storytelling skills on "The Heist" to a decent background beat which would be altered and used again on Black Rob album. Dame Grease produced "Not to be F**ked With" uses memorable piano keyboards, and the Lox delivery on this one is excellent. "B**ches from Eastwick" has lox reminding there listners that females can be as deadly as males. Swizz Beatz produced "All for the Love" is about making money. "So Right" feat. Kelly Price is an upbeat track, that benefits from Kelly Price's smooth and soulful vocals. My favourite track is the albums last, "We'll Always Love Big Poppa", a deep moving tribute to the late great Notorious B.I.G., which has a children's choir repeating tracks title, while Lox drops verses to remember like Style's line of: "Nearly broke down four times writin this verse/Filled with wild madness and sadness it hurts/But ain't no need to cry, cause right now, where you at Is more laced than any place a millionaire lived at/But it's sad that it takes that for us to unite/The only time you see your family is funeral night". Overall this is a good album, two tracks that I did not like are "If You Think I am Jiggy" and "Can't Stop Wont Stop", tracks designed more for a Mase album then a Lox album. As another reviewer mentioned Puffy's interruptions are not helpful, no good for the most part but not real disturbing. I am glad the Lox moved labels, as I think they fit better with Ruff Ryders by far, but this album should not be put down just because it has a different feel to it, the group are on point dropping addictive lyrics, and Bad Boy's production is up to par. This album's commercial success helped the Lox make it in the game. "Money, Power & Respect" wont be remembered as a great album, it was however a succesful debut from Hip Hop's illest trio, worth taking a look at if you enjoy there music.

DMX (Earl Simmons) latest venture &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; soundtrack is decent. DMX produced the soundtrack, and appears on four of the tracks as well as co-stars with Jet Li in the upcoming movie. The first track and lead single is &quot;X Gon'Give It To Ya&quot; a hardcore banging track, X comes across raw and hungry on this one, took me a few listens to get hooked on this track, but when I did really enjoyed it. This is followed by&quot;Go To Sleep&quot; - DMX feat. Eminem &amp; Obie Trice, EM comes out strongest on this one. Bloodlines Bazaar Royale drop in for nice anthem &quot;What's it all for&quot; and bring a memorable distinct rap/rock sound. Hiphops hottest artist at the moment, 50 Cent &amp; G-Unit crew come through on &quot;Follow me Gangster&quot; another ill track. Tempo changes a bit with the relaxed &quot;My Life&quot; Foxy Brown feat. Althea, a Rap/R&amp;B track. Clipse come out grimy on &quot;I'm Serious&quot; a banging track with a sick beat. Favourite track though on this album is DMX's &quot;Right/Wrong&quot;, love the way X comes out across on this one, and the way this track flows. Bloodlines Jinx &amp; Loose come next with &quot;It's Gon' Be What It's Gon' Be&quot; a decent track followed by Big Stan's &quot;Hand that Rocks the Cradle&quot;, both these tracks nicely display some of Bloodlines talent. All the rest of tracks after this are subpar, non memorable tracks with maybe exception of Profit's &quot;Slang Dem Thangs&quot;. Tracks that could of been left off this album for sure: &quot;C2G&quot; (Fat Joe), &quot;Wont be Coming Back&quot; (Baby) and &quot;Focus&quot; (Kashmir). Overall &quot;Cradle 2 Grave Soundtrack&quot; is a decent album, with some nice tracks, and a show of some of X's label (Bloodline) talent. If the movie is as good as soundtrack, then DMX will be getting some more well deserved shine. Most of all though looking forward to X's fifth album coming out later this year.

Bang`Em & Domination debut with "God Giveth God Taketh Away" (2005). Although they are a duo, Domination is the MC while Bang'Em Smurf is the man who had the connects that made it happen forming "Gangster Flip Records" and setting up a distribution deal. Unfortunately Queen's Bang'Em is incarcerated until 2007, so Domination is left to hold things down and he has providing a great album. The album opens with the outstanding "Ill Be Around", Domination provides a powerful dedication to Smurf, which has the makings of a Hip Hop anthem, Domo delivers exceptional rhymes and a chorus to remember while recalling what led to Bang'Em's incarceration. The follow up track is "I Can't Lose", a hungry Domination rips up this cut backed by a pounding beat. Domination then lays down what life in the "Ghetto" is like, which is followed up by "Misery" a track about the struggle to make it. Kurupt makes the album's first guest appearance for an East - West collaboration "Stay Down". "We Just Friends" is a smooth standout; Domo shows love for a shorty who is down. Domination then gets introspective while talking to and about his "Mamma". The banging "We Got Those" follows; Domo shows his dislike for gold digging women while giving Young Dice a shot in the spotlight. Domination talks about politics and dirty cops on the deep "On My Side" feat. V. Alias Khrist. Domo then reps his squad the Silverback Guerillas with the thugged out "Rowdy". On "When You Was Down", original G-Unit member Bang'Em's vocals are used while recalling what happened with his former friend and business partner 50 Cent who left him out in the cold when he caught a case. Domo talks about a variety of ladies on "Love Triangle" and continues to rep for the streets with the "Struggle". Domination then takes a minute to tell a heartfelt story of a woman caught in abusive relationship with "It Won't Stop". Domination dedicates the next track to his fallen comrades including his cousin Lost Boyz member Freaky Tah with the deep "What Does It Take". The final track "Holla My Name" is an outstanding banger where Domination lets it be known that they are ready to take on all competition. Domination delivers an impressive release with "God Giveth God Taketh Away" providing a variety of tracks to enjoy that range from joints that you can bang in the ride, to those substantial ones that make you reflect on the struggles that everyday people face. That said Domination still has room to grow, look forward to seeing that growth and while production was solid it could be better hopefully more producers will step up for future albums. I wouldn't be surprised if this album is slept on, due to underexposure, blackballing etc, it is definitely one of my favorites of this year though highly recommend adding it to the collection and supporting quality music.

Nature's (Jermaine Baxter) debut album "For All Seasons" (2000) is a slept on gem, maybe not a diamond- more like a ruby. It took me awile to realize what a nice album this is, and what a talented rapper Nature can be. Throughout this album he masterfully drops some memorable reality raps while showing impressive skills at storytelling, coming across like an established rapper on his first release. I first heard this Queensbridge rapper on the title track for the soundtrack "In Too Deep" with Nas. He was also a part of the Firm. The powerful "Man's World" has Nature dropping three ill verses inbetween an outstanding chorus. This is followed up by the memorable "We Aint Friends" a track about being betrayed by someone close to you. On the upbeat "S*** Like This" Nature drops some nice rhymes and reps himself. Nature and Nas deliver the goods on "Ultimate High" a wicked collabration track that will make you nod. Nature's storytelling skills shine on "Young Love" a track about having two loves, backed by an accoustic guitar Nature rhymes and at briefly sings, delivering another nice track. On "Nature's Shine", Nature talks about who he raps for and kicks some street knowledge. "Remember" is another standout track which has Nature reminiscing from 83 onwards. Two decent tracks follow then "Don't Stop" closes off the album. There really are no bad tracks on this though a few could have used better production and therefore fall into filler material for me (Go Ahead, Talking that S***) . Nature's lyrics do not dissapoint and his flow is memorable. The fact that he keeps his rhymes realistic and his ego in check enhance his music. I was also impressed by how this album has just one guest appearance (Nas). Nature keeps his listners entertained rhyming creatively, and by doing his own hooks and chorus's and even occasionally singing a line or two. Highly recommend checking out Nature's "For All Seasons" a strong first effort from a still relatively unknown rapper.

Eminem's latest project "Eminem Presents: The Re-Up" (2006) is a solid release. The highlight of this release for me was Eminem's exceptional closer "No Apologies", a powerful cut where Shady shines dropping some on point lyrics matched by an addictive beat. Eminem lets the critics know what he thinks of them, and shows that he can still rip up tracks with the same hunger he had as a young MC. Another favorite track of mine is the single "You Don't Know", 50 Cent, Ca$his,Lloyd Banks and Eminem deliver a killer collaboration, a cut to blast in the ride. Another memorable collaboration is an older released Eminem/Proof (R.I.P.) collab on the grimy "Trapped". The album's Remixes are decent but are not much different from the original tracks (IE Pistol Pistol, Ski Mask Way, Smack That). I am not that impressed with some of the up and coming MC's Shady is bringing in: Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater, Cashis. All the same Eminem, and 50 provide highlight track's making this Mixtape a release worth checking out. 3.5.

The Roots (Black Thought (MC), ?uestlove (Drums), Hub (Bass), Kamal (Keyboards), Knuckles (Percussion), and Captain Kirk (Guitar)) keep things moving delivering their seventh studio album "Game Theory" (2006). Former member Malik B returns for this release appearing on three tracks. Fellow Philadelphia native Peedi Peedi (AKA Peedi Crack formerly of State Property) appears on one track, and it is rumored he will be joining the Roots. Overall this album is laced with darker production and has the Root's talking about more serious issues - like politics, war and the state of the world. The album opens with "Dillatastic Vol Won(derful)" a short instrumental and ends with "Can't Stop This", both a tribute to the late great producer J Dilla aka Jay Dee (R.I.P.). The eight-minute closing track is my favourite on this album, Black Thought rhymes over J Dilla's excellent production providing an outstanding track. The album's first full-length track is "False Media" an ominous sounding track; laced with a dark chorus (Wadud Ahmad), Black Thoughts rhymes are on point. Black Thought reunites with Malik B and both flow fast over the title track "Game Theory". The first single "Don't Feel Right" is a powerful cut, which has Black Thought talking about the problems of the world. The production to "In The Music" is deadly and the highlight of that cut for me, Black Thought continues to drop thought provoking rhymes backed by some words from Wadud Ahmad on "Take It There". John-John provides the chorus to the more laidback sounding "Baby", and the three MC's who have rhymed for the Roots over the years - Black Thought, Malik B and Dice Raw triple tag team "Here I Come". Black Thought, Peedi Peedi rep Philadelphia and talk about their beginnings backed by some feel good production on "Long Time". Black Thought reflects on years past, broken friendships and regrets on the exceptional "Clock With No Hands" backed by some soulful singing from Mercedes Martinez. The Roots shine again with "Atonement" feat. Jack Davey (Brook D'Leu and Jack Davey), Brook's chorus is outstanding. Black Thought never fails to impress me, seems like he gets better and better as time goes by like good wine. The Root's Crew provides outstanding instrumentals and production - I would love to hear them live. Short, memorable & potent "Game Theory" is another keeper for Root's fans.

Choclair's latest album is &quot;Flagrant&quot; (2003). I noticed in the editorial it mentioned this as being his second, it is actually his third (Ice Cold, Memoirs of of Blake Savage). Choclair releases this on his own label Greenprint through EMI. Executive produced by Kareem Blake (Choclair) &amp; Lee Fredericks this album runs in at twelve tracks and has appearances from: Big Black Lincoln, Solitair,Saukrates, Ro Dolla, Andreena Mill and Niya Melodie. &quot;All I Need in This World Is You&quot; starts the album off, with the track title being sung in a chorus. The first song I heard off this cd was the single &quot;Back Where I Stayed&quot; which got a lot of play on local radiostation 94.5 here. This is an exceptional song where Choclair gets introspective about himself, his younger days, growing up and where he is right now. The beat and background chorus are excellent on this track. This is followed up by another outstanding track called &quot;Skyline&quot;, Choclairs lines on this memorable as is the beat and chorus to it. This track also has a nice video. I am not really feeling majority of the rest of the album, lyrically the content does little for me, talking about girls, dropping snoop sounding lines or other lines like &quot;I sent you walking with your Walkman&quot; (Fire) are unentertaining and I personally dont find them worth listening to. One exception is &quot;Watchu Go'n Do&quot;, I like how Choclair shows love to different cities from his hometown Toronto to Montreal to Van to NY. Really there are a limited amount of Canadian Rappers out these days, so I always enjoy checking out there albums, I hope that other members of the Circle will get there own albums out soon, artists like Solitaire &amp; Saukrates (who's Def Jam release is being looked forward to by people on both sides of the border). Choclairs third album &quot;Flagrant&quot; is decent, highlight being the albums two singles.
