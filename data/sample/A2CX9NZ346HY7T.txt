For a movie that was probably made for next to nothing this is really a pretty good crime/sci-fi programmer. Director Edgar Ulmer is famous for making good looking low budget films and this is one of his best.Douglas Kennedy is bank robbing safe cracker Joey Faust sprung from prison by James Griffith(usually a bad guy in b-Westerns and tv shows of the period)to steal radioactive isotopes. Of course to do this Faust has to become transparent and is subjected to radioactive bombardment himself...talk about Faust selling his soul!Corny, insane, implausible. Yet it somehow works! The acting is top-notch for this kind of stuff and the direction is sure-handed. It's under an hour and ends in a big explosion!The ALPHA dvd is very good offering a clear picture at a bargin price. Marguerite (FLIGHT TO MARS) Chapman, Red Morgan (he's in Ulmer's BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER, probably shot around the same time) and Ivan Triesault(the mad scientist here) co-star.Wonderful, whacky fun, a bit sleezy and well made!

I first saw this movie on tv sometime in the 1970's. I'd previously seen several Sam Fuller films, MERRILL'S MAURADERS in the theater; STEEL HELMET, FIXED BAYONETS, BARON OF ARIZONA and 40 GUNS on tv. I liked them all, very much. So when the magazines FILM COMMENT and SIGHT AND SOUND began running articles on "Film Noir" at this time I started scanning the TV GUIDE for such films, catching D.O.A., THE BIG COMBO, and, of course, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET.Now maybe my hopes were too high based on my viewing of past Sam Fuller films but, hyped up as I was, I found this film to be somewhat average, better than most, but nothing really great. I thought the "commie" stuff rather dated. I thought this a lesser Fuller film and filed it away in the backlog of my memory.Flash forward into the 2000's. Film Noir has gained a reputation and lots of attention. It has a big following and many films of the "genre?" are seeing pristine dvd releases. I've been buying them up and enjoying them, bathing in the fatalism that reflects my own life...and yet, always putting off the CRITERION dvd of PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET. After all, I've seen it before and know it's some dated commie movie of no great shakes.Then the local BORDERS announced that it was closing it's doors and I went in and couldn't leave PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET on the shelf at 60% off. So I bought it, took it home and let it sit in a stack for months. Then I got the Film Noir urge, and what the heck, popped it into the dvd player...WOW!!!It was like I had never seen this film before! The image was so crystal clear with such great depth range! Better than it probably appeared in theaters. I sat rivited. I was mesmerized. This was indeed Sam Fuller's greatest film. Widmark was in top form, matching NIGHT AND THE CITY. Thelma Ritter should have won an Oscar. The film should have won several Oscars. Everything was flawless; direction, acting, cinematography, music score.What happened?Was this the same film that I saw on tv 40 years ago?Back then I saw something a little above average.Today I saw a visionary work of art.Maybe I've changed, but most of what I liked or disliked 40 years ago pretty much holds true today, and yet...Maybe it's CRITERION's flawless print of this film that has me seeing this film really for the first time ever, seeing it as it was meant to be seen and experienced....all in all, this is the perfect example of a truly talented director taking pulp fiction material and turning it into a work of art.All I can say in conclusion is that this CRITERION dvd presentation looks better than the day the film was released. If you've seen this noir classic in the distant past then you've never really seen it at all. Buy this dvd and experience PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET again, for the first time ever...Super-Highly recommended!

Right off let's just say that this release from VCI is nothing short of excellent, a nice widescreen transfer with bold colors, a visual treat for Spaghetti Western fans. That alone makes this a must-buy, but there are others reasons, some good, despite the bad and...THE GOOD: A proto DJANGO as if Corbucci were just warming up. But really more like an American Western of the 1950s, just before the "Spaghetti Style/Look" was fully developed by Leone, Tessari, Corbucci and others. The Italians loved American Westerns as the death scene of a henchman in this film, paying homage to Ford's STAGECOACH, testifies.Mitchell is just great as the well-worn Minnesota Clay. He's always been an underrated actor who can do this stuff in his sleep.Fernando Sancho delivers what is to be expected of him, over the top, scenery-chewing histrionics. No one does it as well or is as enjoyable.Lots of familiar gang members, making one of their first go-rounds, in multiple death scenes.High body count.Lots of gunplay and violence.THE BAD: Not the best dubbing, acceptable, but often awkward. Better attention to dialog translation (not VCI's fault) would have made this a much better film.The crappy, cop-out uncut Italian ending which is pure hokum (in Italian with English subtitles) that appears tacked on as if a last minute afterthought. The American release ending, assuming that Clay may be dying, is more in tone with the mood of the film.THE UGLY: Clay's befuddled daughter and twit boyfriend are annoying to no end. They both have far too much screen time. I believe that if they were killed off in the first reel then this may have become a major rather than minor classic.However, we do have Corbucci's FIRST maimed hero, preceeding Django and Silence (THE GREAT SILENCE) who despite physical handicaps fights back to overcome overwhelming odds. Django won, Silence lost...Minnesota Clay???Watch it yourself, whatever ending you prefer.I really liked it. I hope you will too.It's simply a must-see from the early years of the Spaghetti Western, conventional to American standards yet still surprising in sheer European style.And, really, Piero Piccioni's soundtrack is also quite fetching, a mix of the two cultures seemlessly blending as one.For Spaghetti Western or Cameron Mitchell fans, this is essential viewing.

Astounding; words can't describe what a wonderful collection of themes from the Hal Roach LITTLE RASCALS films this is! If you were a kid watching THE RASCALS on tv in the late 1950's to early 60's then this music is forever embedded into your subconscious and this cd is an awakening you'll cherish always. Just when I think one particular tune is the defining theme of the series then another replaces it and yet another and another...right on down to tune #15, then #22, #30, #37, then #40, etc, etc...the whole cd is amazing! I didn't realize that so many different bits of music were associated to these Hal Roach shorts; I would have guessed 5 or 6, but not 50!!! And over 40 are instantly memorable, like I just heard them a month or so ago, not 40 years ago! Composer LeRoy Shield and The Beau Hunks are geniuses. BUY THIS AT ALL COSTS!!!

Just so you know what you're getting, the ALPHA version is very watchable, quite clear, a little soft but a very good buy for the price. I see no need to upgrade.Price is Dr. Wells in this inferior re-make of Roland West's 1926 classic. Most of the atmosphere of West's film is gone, especially missed are the William Cameron Menzies set designs and the rodant-masked thief/killer. However, this version boasts wonderful performances by Vincent Price and Agnes Moorhead with lots of barbed wit and banter. What's weird here is that the actor who played Dr. Wells in the silent 1926 version looks JUST LIKE Vincent Price!!!!!! I saw this 1959 version first on tv in the early 1960's after it was featured in a popular Monster Magazine of the time (no, not FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND) and was completely taken by this adaptation of Mary Roberts Rinehart's novel/play. So, I have the same soft spot in my heart for this Price epic as I do for HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. Both would make a great Halloween double bill, as I've presented them on occassion in the past and will probably do so again this October.Yeah, you can search around for who has the best public domain version of THE BAT, but I'll tell you here and now that the APLHA dvd for the money is probably your best buy, and even better than that, the ALPHA dvd of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is exceptional, clear, pristine, sharp, a remarkable buy at a budget price!!!Shop wisely friends, and enjoy.

I remember when I was too young to see this movie when it was first released and how an older (by 2 yrs.) boy in the neighborhood was telling everyone that this was the scariest movie ever made and how skeletons came out of the movie itself and attacked the audience!!!I wasn't too sure that I wanted to see HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL just quite then...However, I will always think of this film as being very frightening!Watching it again the other day I'm amazed at how really well-made it is and how well it still holds up. Price is just priceless and the acting is fine all around. A good fun time at the old haunted house!The copy I viewed was put out by ALPHA dvd, a hit or miss company on quality transfers. But I will say that their version of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is excellent!!! Very clear with no jumpy splices. It was like watching a very expensive dvd. Don't hesitate to purchase this version as it's the best bargain in the lot!

I'm not sure what it was, but when I first saw this film on TV in the early 1960's I was prepared to like it. At that time I was hooked on steamy studio jungle sets & lots of stock footage. All the local TV stations were playing Tarzan, Jungle Jim and Bomba movies in some sort of JUNGLE LARRY(?)THEATER type program. It was great & all the kids loved it!Now BRIDE OF THE GORILLA comes along with much of the same mix but with a more adult/slanted agenda. Yes, the familar stock footage was there, the fear of a gorilla monster, a witch/voodoo woman, Lon Chaney Jr. and a deadly curse made this absolute viewing, but...this B-horror/thriller had something else going for it: BARBARA PAYTON!Even as a kid I knew she was much much more.., than Maureen O'Sullivan (Jane/ June Cleaver of Tarzan fame)!BRIDE OF THE GORILLA is probably Payton's most memorible camp classic, and she's very good in it. She draws sympathy in a role that twists and curves from cheating wife to loving, devoted wife. Raymond Burr (pre Godzilla & Perry Mason), Tom Conway & Lon Jr. are also very good as is Siodmak's pacing & direction. He directed Chaney 10 yrs. eariler in THE WOLFMAN!Alas, poor Barbara...Her life tumbled downhill...I won't dwell on all the sleaze, you can look it up.However, this is just one fun chiller/thriller, a few curses, a monster thrown in, some good acting and even a bit part by a young Woody Strode.As for the whole gorilla thing...I believe it was all in Barney's head, always have, always will.The ALPHA dvd is pretty good. Quite clear with good audio. Very watchable. I was happy with it.So for a good time in the jungle you really can't go wrong here.Recommended to all lovers of fake jungle sets!

Excellent low-budget film-norish nightmare. Leslie Brooks defines femme- fatale and Russ Vincent, Michael Whalen & Robert Paige are all victims of her desire to rise to the top. MILDRED PIERCE she ain't, but she's what Veda could've been...No need to give away any plot here, but just a note to let you know that the ALPHA dvd is quite acceptable, very clear picture image with minor audio distortion, a good buy...Highly recomended.

The story...Strange deaths, animals, humans, ripped up...Hero is suspected because he trespassed on victim's land. Scientific-type & daughter arrive looking for vanished conquistador & befriend hero. Buried conquistador revives & goes on killing spree...Great location ( Big Bear, Ca.) shooting, PRISTINE PRINT that looks as though it were shot yesterday, & former cowboy hero Bob Steele as the top law officer make this a MUST-HAVE for 50's Horror/Sci-fi fans!!!!I enjoyed this...my wife enjoyed this ( & she's not partial to this stuff...).The end scene at the "mill" was shot at the same location used for so many Roy Rogers, etc. B-Westerns...Republic Mountie Serials & others...GREAT STUFF...NOT TO BE MISSED!!!

SINISTER, the dvd source of RED FORK RANGE, is pretty much noted for their quality releases of early B-Westerns, in fact, they corner the market for providing the best available source material for forgotten and obscure rare films from the 1930s thru the 1960s.The print for RED FORK RANGE suffers. Soft, blurry at times, voice and framing off-kilter, an exceptional reel thrown in the mix, this is a very rare Wally Wales low budget gem from the early days of sound Westerns, and after purchasing SINISTER B-Westerns for countless years, I can truthfully say that this is probably the best version of RED FORK RANGE that you're ever going to see, unless a major re-mastering (highly unlikely) is in the works sometime soon.Yeah, most out there could care less, so what? Some creaky old b&w; oater bites the dust. So what?I beg to differ.I like Wally Wales and try to see as many of his available films as I can. He has a simple charm, much in the Ben Johnson fashion, and his bad man characters (as Hal Taliaferro) also recall Johnson's characters from ONE-EYED JACKS & THE WILD BUNCH.And I also like creaky old B-Westerns from the early 1930s sound era. There's a certain nostalgic charm present, especially when cheap, low budget stunts are performed "as is" without fake computer generated hi-tech cheats.Somebody actually jumped onto those runnning stagecoach horses for probably next to nothing. And the beauty of it all (poor print withstanding) is that IT'S REAL!!!...Computer generated stunts can never replace the feel of real action!And so, in closing, I recommend this version from SINISTER.Soft, yes.Low sound , yes.Great, low-budget B-Western entertainment that simply cannot be copied or re-done today, YES, YES, YES!!!No re-mastering here, just historical significance for those who care....What a great shot as Ruth Mix drives the stagecoach in the climatic race and the camera spots Wally Wales on the nearby hill and follows him as he descends the hill and races alongside and boards the stagecoach. Such stuff dreams are made of.

Love this movie, truly the transition Western between stagey Hollywood productions and the more realistic 60's Westerns be they American or Spaghetti. ONE-EYED JACKS is as stylish as it is exciting and Brando's performance and direction is top-notch despite some critics' claims of egotistic self-indulgence and an inflated budget and shooting schedule. Karl Malden should have won an Oscar and Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens shine in supporting roles. A very rewarding viewing experience. And I just finished watching it now.Bad Blue-Ray? Full Frame? Sick and tired of this film looking like crap. Feel like Ben Johnson complaining, " Get that stinkin' fish outta here."?The dvd I just watched was the DIGIVIEW slim case version, the one with Brando's face in the top corner, with below him Malden and Pellicer and then a group of 5 ruales. It was wide-screened with exceptional color and sound. You'd really have to be nit-picking to hate this version. I enjoyed it very much and can recommend it to all. At least give it a try. You've got little to lose as it's readily available from many Amazon sellers for almost next to nothing.Until a major studio release gives this film the CRITERION treatment it deserves, I'm very pleased with this DIGIVIEW version. It's the best I've seen, and believe me, I've seen a lot of rotten copies of this Western classic.

When you talk about silent comedy it's usually all about Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Arbuckle, they were, after all, the geniuses. But what about the working class comedian? The guy who just went in there and plugged away, being funny because that's just what he did for a living. That's what this collection is all about...SUPER, PRISTINE 35mm prints featuring working-man comics Ben Turpin, Snub Pollard, "Poodles" Hanneford, "Hairbreadth" Harry, Jimmy Aubrey and Izzie & Lizzie. Great treatment for the second tier comic, films that look better than the day they were released, giving us a rare, beautifully packaged example of silent film comedy from others than the "masters". After all you can only watch Chaplin's THE KID so many times without wondering just what else may be out there in the golden age of silent comedy. Well, this is it. Very funny stuff, a magic portal to the 1920's. And the outstanding condition of the prints is truly like stepping back into the past, it's even kind of spooky.This is a great collection that you just have to see for yourself. Super highly recommended.

This is by far the best Roy Rogers film ever made and Roy's own personal favorite. It covers the period of about three years and tells the story of how Trigger came to be. Heartfelt and emotional, not a standard shoot 'em up, but a simple, poetic story of a man and his horse. The acting is outstanding all 'round with an especially good performance by "Gabby" Hayes as a man consumed with hatred of Roy because he thinks Roy is responsible for the death of his great horse, The Golden Sovereign. Jack Holt and Roy Barcroft are the bad guys and Dale Evans and the Sons of the Pioneers round out an exceptional cast. A fine film, an A+ B Western...And the ALPHA dvd is of highest quality, a remarkable transfer, crisp and clean image. Most highly recommended!

Loved this LP . Got the cd right away, and am somewhat befuddled. If they would have only presented the LP AS IS instead of mindlessly repeating tracks (takes) over & over & over &..well, you get the idea..,it gets repetitious & distracts from the impact of the original. A classic case of where MORE is not BETTER! 5 takes of DOWNSTAIRS, 5 of BREADWINNER, 4 of TERRACE THEME... Is this really neccessary?... TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING!!!

This is a GREAT BARGAIN PACK of Image 1950's sci-fi dvds...The transfers are wonderful! COSMIC MAN looks just like it did when I saw it at the theater eons ago!!!...& it is my favorite of the three. FLYING SAUCER is a little slow with not much happening, but this is a VERY EARLY entry into the sci-fi genre & STRANGER FROM VENUS is kind of a remake/take-off on THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, as is COSMIC MAN!...So if you want to see some very good invader-friendly 1950's message oriented films in beautiful condition then this is your ticket! The source material is exceptional!!! & you couldn't get a better introduction to 1950's sci-fi.BUY THIS.

Each and every film here a classic. I have most of them on bad vhs transfers from the 80's, MILIAN CALIBRE, MANHUNT, SCARFACE. All of the films presented here look absolutely GREAT!!! Widescreen, sharp, crisp, clear!!! If you're thinking about purchasing these gems of sex and violence, please go right ahead. Each and every film is a masterpiece in exploitation cinema. No one can or would even dare to make films like these today. No computer generated images of heroes flipping and swinging from high rises here. Down and dirty action and violence on the gut level only. Real action at real time! BEAUTIFUL!And all films have BEAUTIFUL transfers! My God, what are you waiting for, an invitation from Ugo Piazza? Tip the hat and buy.It's truly the best out there of this kind of stuff.Even more than HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Every selection here is a winner, beautifully sung by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. Tallis's Lamentations of Jeremiah set the tonal mood, followed by mostly English composers, William Horsley, John Taverner & Thomas Morley. My favorite is the choir's rendition of the Dutch carol JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN TODAY. I've never heard so beautiful a rendition!!! This Easter Hymn I believe is the need to purchase this particular cd, though all else is SHEER BLISS!!!You simply can't go wrong, wonderful religious music on all counts!!!

Top-notch PRC povery row horror film from the mid-1940s directed by the prolific Sam Newfield, best known for his hundreds of B-Westerns, especially the Billy Carson series starring Buster Crabbe and Al "Fuzzy" St. John.In this one a mad scientist falls in love with a concert pianist's daughter, inflicting acromegaly upon the pianist and promising a cure in exchange for the daughter's hand in marriage. It really plays better than it sounds with good acting from J. Carrol Naish (Markoff,the scientist) and Ralph Morgan as the victim. A few surprises too as things didn't quite go as I assumed they would, in terms of certain characters getting knocked off.Still, despite the usual: a mad scientist, his pretty female assistant/secretary, his giant helper and the old ape in a cage routine, this one delivers the goods and keeps one's interest throughout. And for once, the mad scientist's name is Igor, not the giant helper's.As for Albert Glasser, this has got to be one of his first film scores, and as such adds greatly to the viewing enjoyment. Glasser is one of composers who defined the sound of 1950s sci-fi/horror films with scores to such classics as THE CYCLOPS, THE BEGINNING OF THE END, THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, EARTH VS THE SPIDER and ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE among countless others. It's Glasser's music that makes many of these films so much fun, and while not as pounding or as driven as his later work, his score for THE MONSTER MAKER perfectly sets the tone for what follows. A real treat.And the ALPHA DVD is just excellent with great clarity and sound, looking more like a product you'd expect to pay much more for. A great buy for one of the better PRC releases.

If you're a fan of Tex Ritter movies then this is the cd that you want. It covers Tex's early years and is chock-full of tunes from his Western features; unlike other releases that feature much from Tex's later Country-Western years.This one has SING,COWBOY,SING...SAM HALL...HEADIN' FOR THE RIO GRANDE...ARIZONA DAYS...RIDE,RIDE,RIDE..,& many other movie gems!I play this often & know that you will too!So, if you're a fan of Tex's films, or just like good-early (1935-1945) Western movie music then this one is your meal-ticket!Believe me...you can't go wrong.Recomended.

Important for being the first of the Monogram ROUGH RIDERS series, ARIZONA BOUND (1941) sets the stage for those that followed, in that each Rough Rider arrives on the case in question seperately, and apparently unknown to each other until it's time to play their hand. Buck Jones is retired marshal Buck Roberts, Tim McCoy plays lawman Tim McCall (usually mistaken for a "sky pilot"), and Raymond Hatton rounds out the trio as peace officer Sandy Hopkins, a character he would continue to play in Johnny Mack Brown's NEVADA JACK MCKENZIE series which followed the ROUGH RIDERS after Buck Jones died in the tragic Coconut Grove fire of 1942.ARIZONA BOUND is a good start to the series as the boys solve a series of stagecoach robberies in Mesa City, breaking up bad guy Tris Coffin's gang. Tim McCoy , holding everyone at gunpoint in the saloon and forcing all to sing a song is a classic scene! However, the print used by ALPHA dvd is quite shabby, dark and well-worn, hence a much lower rating than this oater deserves. Five star movie, two star dvd.

If you're planning on purchasing a dvd of D.O.A. (1950), then go ahead with this budget release. The picture is sharp and clear with great depth of background. I was amazed at just how good this dvd was because ALPHA is such a hit or miss company. This has to be one of their best releases ever. Edmond O'Brien runs up and down the streets of San Francisco and L.A. looking for the person who murdered him (by slipping him a "micky" laced with luminous poisoning) at a San Francisco night spot. Lots of great early 1950's on location street shots make viewing all the more interesting. This is Beverly Garland's first movie, and also Neville Brand's as he plays a whacked out psycho hit man. Priceless!Edmond O'Brien really proves just how good shape he's in by doing several long tracking shots, running the busy city streets and sidewalks at a pretty good clip, and less than a mere 20 years later he is barely recognizable as Old Sykes in Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH (1969).D.O.A. is one of the great classic film noirs and this is a great dvd effort from ALPHA. Do not hesitate because of the bargain price. Buy and enjoy.

Good mystery yarn that keeps you both involved and entertained as reporter Mary Roberts (Mary Anderson) uncovers a strange tale of murder and mayhem after interviewing a dying actress. Well plotted little suspense film has the novelty of being filmed in Old Quebec by Russian director Fedor Ozep. The locations are beautiful/striking/haunting, as is this wonderful city.Yes, the print source is poor, but I'm not sure if any other dvd company has yet to offer a better print. This said, the ALPHA dvd is watchable and did not distract from my enjoyment of the film. Helmut Dantine is very effective as the troubled composer as is Mary Anderson as the Nancy Drew type reporter who is old enough to become involved with the male lead. Paul Lukas is exceptional as the lawyer/guiding friend who is much more than what he seems.A very good film of it's type, low-budget noir.This is one you'll enjoy.

Good entry in this series with our 3 heroes tracking down vetern stage robber Black Bart who has disappeared since being paroled 10 years ago. It seems he's back in the business, but is he? Fans of this stuff will easily guess who Black Bart really is while bad-guy George Chesebro commits the robberies. Good banter between John Dusty King and Ray Crash Corrigan, especially when trying to gain female attention. Max Alibi Terhune and his dummy (who's really smarter than most of the cast) Elmer are also on hand. The print quality on this Alpha release is quite good, very clear and much better than some of their other Range Buster films. All in all, an enjoyable B-Western experience. Enjoy.

I really don't get it. This is THE classic Sci-fi TV series of all time. Why 2-sided flipper discs, especially discs that freeze and won't play? Bottom of the barrel ALPHA puts out crappy copies of hard to find movies/tv shows, but at least they're on single-sided discs that play! Why can't this very important series that has countless followers and fans be given a presentation on freeze-free single-sided discs? This is an historically important tv series featuring quality writing, directing and acting. Is someone just being stupid here or are we all re-living a lost episode?If this series was ever re-issued properly on SINGLE-SIDED discs that actually play, those knuckleheads in charge of this fiasco would be surprised by the amount of sales that would be generated. I just can't believe that this is really happening. It just has to be the biggest dvd release screwup of all time!I really don't get it.

This odd story of strange circumstances wrapped around a nifty little tale told on a train is certainly true to the spirit of the INNER SANCTUM radio show of the same period. The ALPHA dvd is really quite good and all involved in this TWILIGHT-ZONISH nightmare turn pretty good performances...Highly recommended for fans of bizarre fiction/film, and a bargain to boot!...just don't go too near the river!!!

Yeah we all know this isn't THE BIG G. He has personality, a soul. This thing is just a special effect run amuck. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? Why violate Godzilla? All they had to do was change a few scenes around and call this the remake of BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, which this movie is actually closer to than GODZILLA. So trash NYC! Let it end in Disney World atop the most current ride attraction...& have a worker dressed in a Mickey Mouse costume fire the radioactive isotope!!! Now it becomes another Tim Burton remake, but that may be good.I saw this film when it hit the theaters and have it on vhs & dvd. I enjoyed it (and still do) a whole heck of alot. It's fast-paced & action-packed! It's exciting & funny! It's a good time for all & a very fine giant monster on the loose film...but it just ain't GODZILLA!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?

MILL CREEK constantly puts out these budget sets of varying quality. Some films here look great, others barely watchable. But that's ok, especially for the price paid, and this is a great way to fill in your Spaghetti Western library along with those excellent releases from WILD EAST. The films in this set are public domain transfers which give genre fans a chance to experience many films at a very low cost.My major gripe is not how poor some films may look, but that they are on flipper discs which are easy to scratch. I'd rather see 22 movies on 11 single-sided discs than 44 on double-sided discs. But that's just my preference. Don't let it prevent you from purchasing this or any MILL CREEK set. Every one is a great value.Some highlights on this set include THE MAN FROM NOWHERE aka ARIZONA COLT, BEN AND CHARLIE and PRICE OF POWER, all starring Giuliano Gemma who in his easy going manner and athelitic ability reminds me alot of Burt Lancaster. Other harder to find (on a budget set) Spaghetti classics include Franco Nero in KEOMA and Maurizio Merli in MANNAJA, so there's lots of good stuff to be had here. And some really good prints too....Just a request to MILL CREEK for future releases. Now that you've covered Spaghetti Westerns I would really like to see box-set releases of the following:1. Euro War movies; THE LAST PANZER, FIVE FOR HELL, DESERT BATTLE, HELL IN NORMANDY, there's many out there.2. Euro Crime/Police/Spy(especially Spy) movies; LIGHTENING BOLT, SPY TODAY DIE TOMORROW, PASSPORT TO HELL, there's tons of 1960's Bond take-offs out there in public domain!...and,3. Euro Sci-fi/MAD MAX rip-offs; ASSIGNMENT OUTER SPACE, BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, FINAL EXECUTIONER, ENDGAME, BLASTFIGHTER, certainly enough to make up a nice set.I always look forward to new releases from MILL CREEK...but please, single-sided discs. I know you can afford it.

The GENEON DVD is the one you want...a beautiful widescreen print of an often put-down Spaghetti Western. Along with CAPTAIN APACHE, A TOWN CALLED HELL [...],BAD MAN'S RIVER & SAMURAI (THE WHITE,THE YELLOW & THE BLACK)this is one of the most shunned of the genre.Am I the only person who likes these movies??? Each one is a STRANGE/UNIQUE look at American/standard Westerns, deserving of critical attention...Yeah,OK...It's not Sergio Leone, and it's not even Giuseppe Colizzi or Sergio Corbucci...but this is a well-directed (Eugenio Martin of BAD MAN'S RIVER),well-produced non-historical account of Villa's slam-bang Spaghetti Western raid on Columbus,N.M...Relax & enjoy...the camera work is great, the acting top-notch(Chuck Conners is a standout!!!)and the overall production values are better than most...so buy this at such a bargain price, buy a six-pack of your favorite Mexican beer, open the taco chips & join Pancho's bandidos/soldiers in their quest for Spaghetti Western political un-correctness...VAMOS A MATAR COMPANEROS!!!!!

Watching TV in the early to mid 1960's I classified everything I liked into the MONSTER MOVIE catagory, being the SHOCK THEATER package featuring all the UNIVERSAL monsters, Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, Man-made monsters, etc. or local TV's 5:00 SHOWTIME which spotlighted TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE, KILLER SHREWS, BEGINNING OF THE END, ATTACK OF THE 50FT. WOMAN, etc..,and of course FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine lump-summed it all together as just simply MONSTER MOVIES, period....yeah, Phil Tucker's ROBOT MONSTER fits neatly into that catagory & I liked this movie alot when it reappeared again and again on local TV. I guess it sorta appeared to be an INVADERS FROM MARS type movie in which..." is it happening, or is it just in the kid's imagination?" type movie. ROMAN and his inability to conquer a few bad actors in Bronson Canyon provided more than his share of classic bad lines in a pretty enjoyable sci-fi no-budget bubble-poppin' cosmic adventure. My life is better for watching this movie. I can't say that for HIGH NOON (yuck) or LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (double yuck).Buy, enjoy...you're as young as your mind forgets you are.

The dvd cover illustration shows the bad mock-closeup (minus drool) used several times too often in this 1957 b&w; giant monster classic. It gives the unwary viewer the false idea that one is in for an unintentional laugh-fest. Quite the opposite! This is an extremely well made stop-motion Willis(KING KONG)O'Brien animation masterpiece! The giant scorpions (and there are many!) move quickly and attack violently, stinging human victims as well as themselves. And the acting, photography and location shooting are all top-notch making this a must see and one of the top three of it's kind along with BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and THEM!So don't be swayed by the cover into thinking this is just some lame grade Z cheepie. It's really ONE OF THE BEST!!!

This is a review for the St-Clair Vision version. Several other versions are available, many with more attractive packaging. However, this version is very watchable, some jump-cuts and splices, a little hard to hear now and then, but for your money this is a pretty good buy for what you get. The visual image is mostly decent and does not hinder the film's impact. I enjoyed watching it and would recommend viewing this film as a double bill with Steele's CASTLE OF BLOOD (1964), or better yet with THE BLANCHVILLE MONSTER (1963) in which co-star Helga Line plays literally the same character.

Quite possibly the greatest silent film of all time. It's right up there with Gance's NAPOLEON & Eisenstein's POTEMKIN. Better than anything Griffith ever did. Pulp fiction for the masses, yet an artistic masterpiece! Closer to Keaton than Chaplin. Not to be taken seriously, but should be taken seriously...I love this film & recommend it to all.Certainly one of the TOP 25 GREATEST FILMS ever made.

This release of Andy Sidaris exploitation gems featuring the ample Sybil Danning among others in plotless, mind-numbing sexy thrillers can't be found elsewhere for this price. There's guns 'n gals galore. Sex and explosions and bullets and death and boobs. What more can an exploitation junkie wish for? You certainly get your dollars worth here, hours of sleazy entertainment for mere peanuts. This is a really good buy for fans of 1980's drive-in fare, though most of these were released directly onto video.However...I'd be more than happy to pay the listed price for fewer movies if only they'd be on single-sided discs, or even double the listed price for all of these movies on single-sided discs. Double-sided discs tend to get scratched easier and there's usually problems with freezing, skipping, and unreadable coding when so much is crammed onto double-sided discs.Still, this is one of MILL CREEK's better sets. A great time can be had here with some pals and a keg of beer. I just wish that these movies were on single-sided discs, even for double the bargain price!

Let me say right off that these two Tex Ritter films offer exceptional prints, clear and sharp with excellent audio as well.And this is a fantastic buy for B-Western fans especially since ROLLIN' WESTWARD (1939) is very hard to find in any format and once thought to be a lost film. Charlie King starts this one off seeming like a good guy but we've all seen too many oaters not to know that he'll be getting bounced around by Tex before the end credits roll. Nice to see a young Hank Worden ('Ol Mose in Ford's THE SEARCHERS) as a not too bright crooked sheriff. Worden I understand was somewhat responsible for Tex and leading lady Dorothy Fay getting hitched in real life.ROLLIN' HOME TO TEXAS (1940) has Tex and sidekick "ARKANSAS SLIM" Andrews busting a bank robbery gang involving escaped convicts from the penitentiary run by Tex's uncle. With Eddie Dean along as the sheriff there's plenty of good songs in this one. Tex and Slim sing one duet, "...I'm Tex...I'm Slim...I'm me...I'm him!". Western Swing star Cal Shrum and his Rhythm Rangers (they're pictured on the cover of the dvd) also get to perform several songs, so if you're a fan of Cowboy/Hillbilly/Western Swing music then this is one movie that you really need to see!!!And as I mentioned, the ALPHA dvd is just great, looks great, sounds great...Get this one.

I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE ON A LOCAL TV PROGRAM CALLED 5:00 SHOWTIME IN THE MID-1960's & BEING A YOUNG LAD AT THE TIME FOUND THE MANSTER SOMEWHAT UNSETTLING, MORE ADULT-THEMED & LURID THAN THE USUAL BRIDE OF THE MONSTER/COSMIC MAN STUFF... WHICH IS WHY IT BECAME AN INSTANT FAVORITE!YEAH IT'S KINDDA HOKEY & CHEAPLY MADE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY ENTERTAINING AND STILL FUN TO WATCH. THE HERO ISN'T REALLY A HERO (AN ALCOHOLIC SCUMBAG PERHAPS ) & THE MAD DOCTOR ISN'T REALLY ALL THAT MAD (HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD WITH AN ARMY OF MANSTERS ).WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A LOW-KEY NOIRISH MASTERPIECE OF NIGHTMARE PROPORTIONS...OR JUST A GOOD TIME AT THE SAKI BAR. THE MANSTER STALKS HIS VICTIMS IN JAPANESE BACK-ALLEYS & THE KILLINGS ARE STRIKING & WELL DONE. AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE EYEBALL ON THE SHOULDER SCENE. IT'S ALL SO TERRIFYING & BLEAK YET FASCINATING & INANE. RECOMMENDED.I VIEWED THE ALPHA DVD & IT PLAYED FINE...NO SKIPPING, NO FREEZING...& THE PICTURE QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD,CLEAR & QUITE WATCHABLE MAKING THIS DVD AN EXCEPTIONAL BARGAIN. AS WITH THE FILM ITSELF, THE ALPHA DVD VERSION IS RECOMMENDED.

This is definately a mixed-bag of Roy Rogers films, but really worth checking out. As stated in a previous review, LIGHTS OF OLD SANTA FE is a heavily edited version, however, UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS appears complete and is 20min. longer +2songs than the Roy Rogers Authorized HAPPY TRAILS THEATER release...& it looks great too!20 movies here for under ten bucks...& they all are in decent shape (visually), some edited for TV consumption, some complete.All in all, a good value for your hard earned cash.Buy this as a starter pack and then look for complete versions of your favorites...& this could be a hard task since Roy's movies were cut for TV eons ago. However, complete versions are out there.Mill Creek has great packaging and a pretty good product.20 Roy movies. Under 10 bucks from AMAZON...It's a good value!

As the alien in PLAN 9 said, "...Idiots, you're all idiots!"...Hoping not to lose a few sales to PC consumers the manufacturer dubbed Charlie's oriental voice into proper english thereby losing thousands of sales to customers like me who want the real thing. And now it's probably not profitable to re-issue the cartoons correctly. And the PC people aren't going to buy Magoo anyway, or just complain about poking fun at the visually and/or hearing impaired!!!! Somebody needs to be fired... IDIOTS!!!!

Director/star Allen Baron's skill as a comic book artist shines through on this remarkable no-budget noir masterpiece about hitman Baby Boy Frankie Bono just in from Cleveland for a bad Christmas in the Big Apple. Baron's film does have the look of a living comic book with Frankie moving from panel to panel, well-framed and perfectly composed, each shot almost a drawing. I can even imagine the thought bubble above Frankie's head. In fact, a little comic book illustrating this very concept comes packaged along with the dvd.Bleak, existential, realistic...we watch as Frankie sets up his hit and kills time in NYC. Fate, the leading character in so many noirs like this one, steps in at the end to deal with Baby Boy Frankie. Well made and very well acted by mostly unknowns, this is one not to be missed. The extras, including a trip with director Baron back to the NYC locations 30 years later are fantastic.I can well recommend this tight little classic to all lovers of the noir style, especially those who love French gangster films/ New Wave being produced around the same time. Definately 5 stars!

When ALFREDO first came out (...being a Peckinpah WILD BUNCH fan) I took my then spouse (great date flick) to the Salem, Ohio twin-cinema to view this masterpiece. My jaw dropped. This was either the worse film I had ever seen or the greatest. High embarassment or true art. My God, what was going on here? Mass hysteria. Not ONE likeable character. Over the top violence in situations that seemed very real, yet surreal. Slice of life vs slice of death. And Oates, brain-fried in that dirty white suit, a looser who had hit rock bottom and the only way up was with a gun. Simply amazing, nothing ever like it, nothing again ever will be.Bottom line..., I liked it, even though my ex and I were the only two in the theater that afternoon... Then, later on that day, I told a buddy of mine of this film and the two of us went down for an evening showing. And again, we were the only two in the theater. It seemed that nobody cared at all about this film, which was somewhat strange because Peckinpah was just recently BIG BOX OFFICE with THE WILD BUNCH, STRAW DOGS and THE GETAWAY.Maybe I just missed the boat somewhere, I really don't know, but BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA is one of my all time favorite films. And Sam Peckinpah one of my favorite directors. Back in the mid 1960s as an impressionable teenager I found my truth and way of life not in the music of The Beatles but from watching Joel McCrea in the NBC Saturday Night Movie as Steve Judd proclaiming about "...entering my house justified."...from thereon a Peckinpah fan. Loved MAJOR DUNDEE (the new Ford?) and THE WILD BUNCH (the new God???)And now,...this.Great? Awkward? Overbearing? Redeaming? Art? Shit?Bottom line, again...I liked it.Draw whatever conclusions you must. Love or hate Peckinpah or this film, I will understand.This is Sam's most personal film. It's about himself, what makes him tick. It's about art and a film director's personal vision. And it's a Bloody-Good ride for all involved! ...Read the details (spoilers) from the other reviews, as though a plot synopsis is even relevent.Just buy this. Then sit back and enjoy the mayhem, an adventure on the outer edges of hell, where a man can talk earnestly to a decapitated head...and learn something.

If you like your Ballads with a sax, then, really, you need this cd...and the cover art work never reflected the mood/style of an album better than this!...Get this cd, I love it!!!

Pretty decent print of CALTIKI, especially since my vhs copy is so dark as to render viewing almost impossible. Now the voice sync is off a fraction of a second during the last third of the movie, but loving this kind of schlock it's no big deal, at least not to me.Fans of Euro-Trash cinema may identify Caltiki-crazed explorer Gerard Herter ( he's the guy who loses both his hand and his mind to Caltiki ) as a vetern of Spaghetti Westerns playing arrogant Prussian/German types in THE BIG GUNDOWN and ADIOS SABATA. He was also ( cast the same ) in the Steve Reeves adventure THE WHITE WARRIOR.This is great Blob-style stuff in b&w; from an era that produced so many enjoyable cheap thrills. The ending with Caltiki consuming the house, threatening the wife and child of the hero only to be destroyed by the Mexican army's flame-throwers is a very satisfactory example of classic B-movie Monster mayhem...it excited me when I saw it on tv in the early 60's and it brought back fond memories.You can buy this...it is very watchable, other than the slight sync problem. The disc does not skip or freeze. The image is a vast improvement over the vhs dupe I bought some 15 years ago.Also, as a bonus is a version of ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS, the Gamera fan favorite also known as GAMERA VS. GUIRON (1969) in which two boys are taken captive by alien space babes. It's a kid's film and is in color, and though the color isn't sharp and pristine, it's very acceptable and the little tykes in your household will love it...All in all, a very good double-bill buy!Both films are in full screen.I'm happy with this purchase.p.s.....just a reminder that the soundtrack to CALTIKI is available on cd through a company called SCREEN ARCHIVES. Check out their website if interested.

This is a review for the MIRACLE DVD of Samuel Fuller's semi-noir classic THE NAKED KISS. I'll skip the plot description and great opening with the bald prostitute Kelly beating up on her pimp...Memorize the cover, the one with Anthony Eisley's moustache that does not appear in the film. THIS IS THE DVD TO BUY...I own several Criterion dvds: NAKED CITY, RIFIFI, LE SAMOURAI, BRUTE FORCE, ALPHAVILLE...but not Sam Fuller's THE NAKED KISS...because I found a copy of the MIRACLE dvd in the discount bin at the local SAV-A-LOT for ONE BUCK!...and it is a VERY GOOD version (now, I have no idea how GOOD the Criterion dvd is...). However, the MIRACLE dvd is just as good as my VCI video tape, which is pretty dang good.SO... if you'd like to see this amazing film, but shelling out BIG BUCKS is a consideration...then please, MEMORIZE the cover of this MIRACLE dvd and order it thru Amazon or a seller...for under 10 bucks you're way ahead!...TOP-NOTCH DVD & FILM...5 STARS!!!...enjoy....

Roy (billed as Leonard Slye) and the Sons of the Pioneers (all appearing as the singing O'Keefe brothers) rob a bus??? in which sheriff Gene is transporting wife beater (in film only) Frankie Marvin. Also aboard is a girl (Hope Manning) fleeing Chicago mobsters after witnessing a mob murder. The destination is Turquoise City. Lon Chaney Jr. is a gangster, Smiley Burnette a deputy, Oscar and Elmer are gas station attendent/ rubes (think Goober & Gomer) and there are plenty of songs, fights, shootings, fast cars and even faster horses in this wild B-Western that defies reality and logic in this amazingly wonderful 1930's Depression-era escapist Extravaganza!!!Cowboys vs gangsters!!! Tommyguns vs six-shooters!!!Kind of like Al Capone comes to Dodge City.The Sons of the Pioneers sing SILENT TRAILS in jail. Gene pardons the O'Keefe boys if they join the posse. Gene gets the girl.GREAT STUFF all 'round!!!Buy this Alpha dvd, the image is very clear/sharp for a public domain issue. I keep it alongside my Image Gene Autry dvd collection.A great buy for the money and a great Gene Autry movie on so many counts!!!

I've been so tempted to purchase Sam Peckinpah's DEADLY COMPANIONS from overseas (Region 2) as both the UK and Germany releases offer widescreen prints of this Western. Here in the US all we've ever gotten is the chopped-up, faded, blurry pan and scan version offered by dozens of cheap public domain companies. Seeing this film newly restored and in a widescreen presentation from VCI will be like seeing it for the first time. I, for one, can hardly wait.UPDATE...The wait is over and this release from VCI looks just great in a stunning widescreen transfer with vibrant colors and a sharp image! I've always liked this movie, and now more so than ever. Great release VCI!

According to the Alpha dvd jacket sleeve Hoot Gibson "...considered his part in the fast-paced western WILD HORSE to be his favorite among all his starring roles." I would have to agree with the HOOTER. A HUGE star in the silent era, Hoot Gibson was one of the few cowboy heroes whose screen presence benefited from the arrival of sound, although his career did not. The major studios felt westerns had no place in talkies and Universal dumped Hoot forcing the star to hang on with poverty row studios. Ensuing court battles kept Hoot off the big screen for a couple years and by the time he was ready to hop back into the saddle singing cowboys were becoming the craze. Hoot, Ken Maynard, Tom Mix, Tim McCoy, Buck Jones & others were suddenly old-timers.WILD HORSE is one of the truly GREAT low-budget B-Westerns! And Alpha's dvd print is outstanding! Some minor speckling, some scratches, some noise distortion, nothing to distract from viewing enjoyment. This print is beautiful, especially for a film released in 1931. Sharp, crisp images with background depth, clear and detailed...a visual treat!Hoot and sidekick Skeeter try to capture the wild Devil Horse for the rodeo, but Edmond Cobb kills Skeeter and steals the horse leaving Hoot to be blamed for murder. This could well be Cobb's best preformance in a B-Western. He gets lots of screen time in a meaty role.Likeable Bill Robbins who plays unlucky Skeeter was unlucky in real life as well, being killed in an automobile accident shortly after this film was made.Stepin Fetchit's humor is embarrasing and could be done without.Hoot is simply great, as quick with his wit as with his gun. Silent films could never showcase Hoot's humor to such an advantage! And it's Hoot's humor and line delivery that make this film seem so fresh, even today.WILD HORSE is a must see for fans of B-Westerns and Hoot Gibson, and the Alpha dvd is the one to get.My HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!

I can only add to what others before me have already stated. I just spent the afternoon watching 4 Alpha dvd noirs and this is certainly the most bizzare/dreamlike noir of the batch ( BLONDE ICE, INNER SANCTUM, & WHISPERING CITY being the others ) and certainly the worse video transfer (though WHISPERING CITY is also pretty awful!!!). Jumps, cut-aways, splices, splotches, murky audio, etc., make viewing a challenge. I actually thought they had switched reels somewhere!!!I can only add (BEG!!!) that this unique noir someday gets the quality up-grade it really deserves. A top-notch noir classic with great performances by all involved! Robert Cummings has never been better.SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, SOMEHOW PLEASE RESTORE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!p.s.,.......the source material for both BLONDE ICE & INNER SANCTUM were QUITE GOOD, so if you're thinking of either of these two as possible purchases then go ahead, they're super bargains of very acceptable prints!!!

Two classic no-budget Monogram gems, Boris' THE APE (1940) & Bela's THE APE MAN (1943) are both released by ALPHA dvd, and both are good enough copies to add to your dvd library. The ALPHA packaging is always nifty and there's little difference in dvd quality to recommend any other public domain issue over ALPHA's.THE APE has Dear Boris as a kindly old doctor who needs to kill people in order to acquire spinal fluid to make a young girl walk again. THE APE MAN has Poor Bela as a kindly old doctor who needs to kill...,etc. Actually this is really two versions of pretty much the same movie, both by poverty row Monogram studios, made only a few years apart. The only difference is that Boris puts on an ape suit to kill and Bela actually becomes an ape.Both ALPHA dvds are better than average. Public domain issues vary in quality, and that said, these two releases by ALPHA, even though they're not remastered, are quite acceptable, pretty much the same as when I first saw them on tv back in the mid-1960s.As to which is the better film?...For me it's Dear Boris in THE APE MAN. Poor Bela's is ruined by the comic ending. But that's just me. Watch them both and judge for yourself. All said, this is B-Movie Heaven of wacky horror fun!

32JAZZ has put out some pretty good cd's and this is one of them. I play this often. If you like blusie-sax to mellow out to after a hard day at the grind or want that perfect invite-the-date over for a romantic supper music then this is the ticket. However, if you're just into great sax playing by one of the absolute masters of the craft, then this cd can also come highly recommended. Great sound! Great packaging! Excellent notes (8 page booklet) and all at a giveaway price! You can't go wrong here and you should pick this up before it becomes unavailable. Also check out 32JAZZ'S selection on Sonny Stitt: GIVIN' AWAY THE STORE...12!...THE CHAMP...GREAT STUFF!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

William Castle has got to be (hands down!) the best horror producer/director of his era. Roger Corman gave us trash on a non-existant budget that was fun. Mr. B.I.G., Bert I. Gordon gave us well,...BIG: AMAZING COLLOSAL MAN, CYCLOPS, GIANT SPIDER INVASION, BEGINNING OF THE END, etc., and again fun.William Castle is all together a different story. He had the ability to make a low budget go a long way and generate such classics as Vincent Price's HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THE TINGLER. Riding the crest of Hitchcock's PSYCHO and Aldrich's WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Castle placed Joan Crawford into STRAIT JACKET and Barbara Stanwick into THE NIGHT WALKER, both highly suspenseful, credible motion pictures on minimalistic budgets. And unlike Corman and Gordon, Castle's films had a real polish to them, a fine noirish feel with competent acting and production values.And so, HOMICIDAL, which I belive is Castle's best film by far. I truly liked it better than PSYCO, which outside the shower scene, is nowhere near as interesting and ultimately disturbing as HOMICIDAL. Jean Arliss, simply outstanding! I will not tell any of the plot for fear of being banished to the "coward's corner". You just have to see this film for yourself. I have already shown this dvd to a half dozen or so who have never heard of this film and they were all amazed and loved it! I think you will too...Enjoy.

Eugene Lourie made the same film three times and this one is the best of the three, though the other two: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH(1959) and GORGO(1961) are pretty good as well.When an atomic bomb goes off near the Artic Circle it unleashes a sleeping giant Rhedosaurus that soon begins moving south toward it's place of birth near NYC., destroying fishing boats, lighthouses or whatever is in it's path.Paul Christian plays a welcomed french-speaking scientific hero-type giving the role a more unusual slant. Kenneth Tobey (THE THING...FROM ANOTHER WORLD, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA)) plays his military role from memory as does friendly professor Cecil Kellaway who gets swallowed up in a diving bell. Other familiar faces abound including King Donovan (INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), Frank Fergeson (Mayberry's Foley the butcher), Jack Pennick (John Ford regular) and James Best (KILLER SHREWS) in one of his earliest screen appearences. Pretty Paula Raymond (HAND OF DEATH) is better than most as the female love interest.However..., even though the army can't kill the beast, it takes future Spaghetti Western superstar Lee Van Cleef just one shot to do him in! Sergio Leone must have been watching this one.A TRUE CLASSIC of 1950's sci-fi, right up there with THE THING..., THEM and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Not to be missed.

What a hit-or-miss this one is. Essential KRIMI, soft print (ALPHA DVD), yet alot of good-looking, sharp images, it varies from scene to scene. The STRANGLER is bumping off most cast members in pursuit of stolen diamonds, yet nobody trusts anyone in this fog-laden atmospheric thriller. An absolute MUST-HAVE to complete, or even just to start your collection of this stuff. This is VERY WATCHABLE, not SUPER-DIGITAL HIGH DEFINITION quailty, but you could wait several generations for that. You need to see this movie now, and this bargain dvd is that chance. It's VERY WATCHABLE (as I repeat)and affordable, the forerunner of the Italian Giallo. Buy this shabby, quirky yet quality dvd...hit or miss. I love this movie and support it's pre-Bond, pre-Giallo quasi-spy/killer/horror approach. Great stuff at a bargain price, buy, enjoy.

This gives those of you who are unfamiliar with Bill Cody a good chance to sample his work...and without spending much to do it.First up is the dvd cover selection THE VANISHING RIDERS (1935).The print used here is not very good; grainy and very choppy at times. The total running times is just 49min. COWBOY SHOOTING STARS lists it at 58min., so almost 10min. are missing. Right from the get-go, after the credits, we jump into action that's obviously missing the set-up. Maybe this is the best print currently available. I don't know, this is the first time I've seen this film.However, important issues aside, this is one heck of a fun movie! Bill and his adopted son Tim (played by Bill's real life son Bill Cody Jr.) drive all the bad guys out of ghost town Silver City by pretending to be ghosts. They dress themselves and their horses up like skeletons for one hoot of a haunting! If you're a fan of poverty row horror films of the 1930's (Lugosi, Zucco, etc.) you'll get a kick out of this.Wally Wales (former silent cowboy hero and fan favorite) plays Wolf Larson, the leader of the bad guys and he's simply great as usual. Bud Buster is around for comedy relief, but it's really the entire outlaw gang that supplies most of the laughs, especially when trying to sing some lame song early in the film.The second feature, FRONTIER DAYS (1934), is the one worth the 5 stars. This is one of the films in which Bill wears his famous 50-gallon white cowboy hat that easily looks 10 sizes too big for his small head and body stature. And he has a tough time keeping it on, especially when diving head-first through windows and such!The plots matter little with B-Westerns, it's the atmosphere and the wonders of low budget film-making that stand out...but in this one Bill is falsely accused of murdering a rancher and must clear himself and win the pretty girl.A really stand-out scene has Bill turning himself in for the reward money to pay off the ranch loan with.FRONTIER DAYS is an excellent, very enjoyable B-Western, sure to bring a smile to all. The Lone Pine locations are beautiful to behold!Bill Cody is not by any means a great actor, nor is his son Bill Cody Jr. who also turns up here, but that's part of their charm. Wheeler Oakman is excellent as the lead heavy bank manager; suit, pencil moustache and all. William Desmond plays a crooked lawman and Lafe McKee is around too.The Alpha dvd print here is very good with nice clear sharp image quality.They seldom come better than this and make the dvd a must!So, saddle-up with big hat Bill Cody and ride together through all those big rock formations saving ranches from evil bankers...a good time for all!

I really love watching B-Westerns!And this one is a real fan favorite as Bob Steele and Buck Conners help Roberta Gale bring her herd through the pass blocked by bad-guy Steve Clark. There's lots of side switching as Bob & Buck fistfight their way through hordes of henchmen. Bob dynamites the pass at the end, blowing Clark's gunmen to kingdom come!This one was directed by Bob's father, Robert Bradbury and features heavy Earl Dwire (pretending to be Bob's lost stepfather). Dwire cheats at cards and when he draws on Bob gets gunned down by Buck! This scene is fast and realistic and shows Buck to be more than the typical sidekick.Footnote: Buck Conners who plays Fuzz, a white-whiskered old timer, was (according to author Bobby Copeland in his exceptional book B-WESTERN BOOT HILL) buried behind a Chinese restaurant in Quartzite, Az.(1947). I'm not too sure I'd want to eat there...So if you like good action-packed B-Westerns then check this one out. The Alpha dvd is really pretty good for a 70+ yr.old movie...Good stuff all 'round!

The promo on the dvd reads " HALF MAN! HALF MONSTER! ", I thought that was THE MANSTER's line! However, this manster resembles nothing more than some big guy in a furry costume who gets captured during a Himalayan expedition then taken back to LA where he escapes into the sewers. This is one of those no-budget fun to watch 1950's horror films that keeps you smiling from reel to reel. Certainly W. Lee Wilder's best film next to KILLERS FROM SPACE.And as for the "noir" angle, in a couple scenes Paul Langton reminded me alot of William Holden in UNION STATION for some odd reason.And when we get to LA and the police put out a dragnet ( they even bring a net! ) the movie takes on a decidedly noir look with it's night scenes and chase sequences. When the cops go down into the sewers I half expected them to encounter Richard Basehart from HE WALKED BY NIGHT rather than some goofy yeti monster!So, maybe what we have here is another entry into the noir-horror genre alongside NIGHT OF THE DEMON, HANGOVER SQUARE, THE RED HOUSE and anything produced by Val Lewton. But then again, probably not.

Both titles for this movie are incorrect. CREATURE WITH THE BLUE HAND was a title given to the movie by U.S.A. distributor Roger Corman and THE BLOODY DEAD is a later effort with poor new footage intigrated into the original footage, to be avoided at all costs.The original title for this movie is simply THE BLUE HAND, directed by Alfred Vohrer and starring Harold Leipnitz, Klaus Kinski and Diana Korner. The official release date is 1967. It's about Klaus playing twin brothers, one, the elite Richard, baron of a gothic castle, and the other the deranged (or is he?) David, who is confined to an insane asylum for a murder which he suppossedly did not commit. David escapes (with mysterious help) and runs away into the night to his gothic home which appears to be about a mile or so from the asylum. Once there many hooded murders occur, committed by THE BLUE HAND and his razor sharp...well, you get the idea.Is Klaus really guilty? Will the brothers be happy together? Will the Scotland Yard detective solve the mystery? Will Sir John get a new secretary? I hope not. She's HOT!!!Lots of stuff going on here. Spooky gothic surroundings, twists and turns in a seemingly incoherent plot that only enhances the viewing enjoyment of this clever and witty German murder mystery.A lot of the actors and the characters that they play reappear in director Vohrer's COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS which was made at around the same time and is also available on dvd. I SUPER-RECOMMEND that you pick it up as well. This is really great stuff from the 1960's, generally classified as GERMAN TRASH CINEMA, meaning "pulp fiction" cinema at it's best!You've got a gothic castle, secret passageways, a demented doctor, a mysterious hooded killer, a butler that gives a great John Carridine performance, nice color, and a whacky mod score! A schlock fan's dream come true. But this film is no laughing matter, not in the Ed Wood fashion. It's played straight and it's pretty well done, a great example of 60's Euro pop culture & style. Highly recommended.

This is a review for the MIRACLE PICTURES dvd as pictured, with a bare-chested Steve Reeves w/the tag: "At the peak of the universe...at the pinnacle of the world stands...THE WHITE WARRIOR!"This is a widescreen version of Reeves' lesser known Russian(1840's)epic in which he rebels against the Czar's mighty army. Action, romance and sweeping grandeur...all on a budget!This is a great fun movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family, if the kids can sit through a no-effects extravaganza and use their imagination.I repeat: this is a widescreen version (Miracle Pictures).I bought mine at a discount store, so if you don't want to shell out the $17+ bucks & decide to go through a source other than AMAZON make sure that this is the version you'll be getting and not some fullscreen pan & scan copy.And if you're a fan of Reeves and this type of adventure/action then you know that a good copy of WHITE WARRIOR is a must!Buy and enjoy.

Lee J. Cobb has the lead role in this noirish nightmare of fate closing in. In the style of DOUBLE INDEMINITY, cop Cobb covers up for lover Jane Wyatt who kills her husband when he attempts to murder her. It seems that nothing can go wrong. The alibi is perfect, the witnesses are out in left field and a liquor store killer is ripe for the rap...However, in film noir Cobb doesn't stand a chance as his rookie cop brother figures things out. Fate, fate, fate...Great script, acting, and San Francisco locations circa 1950 make this a winner on all counts!...However, the film has fallen into public domain and although the visual is quite acceptible there are jumps and cuts/splices and the soundtrack is pretty shabby with hisses, pops and humming, though some scenes are really very good.So, if you're looking for a neat little noir then the price is right for this this mini-classic. Recommended viewing.

Sorry, but I've a much better print of this film on vhs, bolder, brighter colors. I bought this only because the SINISTER CINEMA catalog listed their version of this film as having " GOOD COLOR "......Maybe that means faded washed-out color is good, I don't know. All I do know is that if you already have this gem of an Italian Sci-Fi film on vhs then you're probably better off sticking to what you have then going here. Maybe, in the far distant future some dvd company will see fit to give this film the proper release it deserves, along with other Italian Sci-Fi classics like WAR OF THE PLANETS, WILD, WILD, PLANET, and SNOW DEVILS being offered by WARNER BROS. on dvd-r at far too much $$$...Give us fans of such stuff a break!!!Go to OLDIES.com, they often run WARNER BROS. dvds at a pretty good discount. That's where I'm ordering my copies of WAR OF THE PLANETS, WAR BETWEEN THE PLANETS and SNOW DEVILS.As for BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, I guess I'll just have to go on waiting until some major company steps up and releases this classic. Come on, it has one of Claude Raines best performances as well as being one of Giuliano Gemma's (PISTOL FOR RINGO, ARIZONA COLT) first billed roles.Sorry again, but even as this is a real miss from Sinister Cimema, go to their web site and order any Spaghetti Western title that's listed as 35mm/scope. They're ALL GREAT!!!! I finally got a chance to see BULLETS DON'T ARGUE, the Rod Cameron Spaghetti Western that was the main feature being shot with back-up money being channelled into the low-next to nothing budgeted A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. FISTFUL made history and BULLETS DON'T ARGUE is all but forgotten, 'tho is was destined to be THE MAJOR FEATURE.Let me tell you, it's really a pretty good movie and I enjoyed it a lot...looks as though it had been shot yesterday.So forget their crappy BATTLE OF THE WORLDS, my monotary loss, hopefully not your's, but check out their Spaghetti Western selection which offers some pretty great stuff.

With vetern actor John Lund in the Lee Marvin role, five death row convicts are given pardons to undertake a suicide mission behind Indian lines during the Civil War. Lots of endless riding and campfires later they finally come upon the stage stop run by Dorothy Malone and her old coot pappy where their ambush is to take place. Some girl squabbling later we get into the action as the convicts finally ambush a stagecoach and fall out among each other.Roger Corman's first feature is a pleasant enough Western, not a bad way to pass an hour or so. The MGM dvd is very good, offering a nice print, rich in color with much of the production being shot on location, though I did notice shadows reflected on studio backdrops several times.Along with Lund for the ride are Mike "Touch" Conners looking as if he's auditioning for the role of a long lost Maverick brother and Paul Birch, Mr. White Eyes from Corman's NOT OF THIS EARTH. Bob Campbell and Johnathan Haze do well as the psychotic Candy brothers. Haze, another Corman regular, is fondly remembered as Seymour, the lead in LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. Jack Ingram, vetern bad guy of Serial and B-Western fame, is also on hand as a hostage toward the end of the film.Not a bad debute for Roger Corman, actually pretty good for a no budget wonder. I enjoyed it especially for the Dirty Dozen angle which Corman used again for his WW2 pic THE SECRET INVASION, also made before THE DIRTY DOZEN. Did Corman hold the rights for this plot device?This movie also rides the range long before THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN which also features gunmen taking on a suicide mission, with much of the time spent on the mostly all male cast.Again, not great, but not bad either. Probably in my top 200 Western favorites.

I admit a fondness for this film having seen it countless times on tv in the early 1960's. Back then FAMOUS MONSTERS was THE magazine and Bela WAS Bela! I'm really glad that I was a part of such things, and so, hold this B-movie favorite on the HORROR/CAMP? pedistal.The plot?...Bela with help from dwarf Angelo Rossito capture would-be dead brides-to-be in order to extract fluids from them to keep his aging wife alive.The cost of the ALPHA dvd is minimal and the overall quality is quite acceptible, at least as good as I can ever remember it being on tv.This one is probably my personal Bela Lugosi favorite from his 1940's poverty row era, but don't let that influence your choice.Great low budget stuff here, played for gruesome horrors yet maintaining a sense of dry humor. Bela's off-kilter clan is kinda like the Adams Family without the jokes, yet comical in an insane way.Buy. Enjoy.

This dvd produced by Miracle Productions offers a pretty good version of this "old chestnut" concerning the life , career & death of Abraham Lincoln. The image is quite clear & the audio acceptable. This is a GREAT buy if you can pick one up at a local SAV-A-LOT or someplace similar (like I did) for a buck. The asking price of $17.98 is a bit steep for this NO-FRILLS release.Griffith did OK by this film but his style & method of film making was already being considered "old fashioned" even for the early sound era. And Griffith himself was easily a much more assured director in the silent era...just compare the assassination of Lincoln in this soundie to the superior version of the same incident in THE BIRTH OF A NATION. The tension, the dramatic...all gone. It really goes to show how the far the MASTER had fallen, or in all fairness, had been left behind.Now mind you, I'm not putting down this film or Griffith. I truly believe that this is an important film & needs to be seen...by YOU. And the version here presented by Miracle is quite acceptable, but you needn't pay the price when it can be had from Amazon dealers for a couple bucks. Please buy this classic & enjoy this slice of Americana, it's well worth the investment and a "keeper" to your dvd library.

I saw this on tv back in the 60s, maybe early 70s, as a teen, young adult. I remembered that it was about a bunch of old guys in suits who rob a bank then have a falling out. Nothing much.Since I've now been looking into Film Noir and re-discovering alot of gems, I thought I'd give this one another look, especially since it was put out by MGM and wasn't a public domain cheap job (hint...ALPHA).My God, what a great movie, delivering just like the dvd cover states, "A Tough and Taught drama, bristling with Suspense!". And the MGM dvd is a beautiful print, crisp and sharp, making for me a viewing experience akin to sitting in a theater in 1952. And how refreshing seeing REAL-TIME action from real men instead of some lame preppy-boy backflipping while firing pistols in both hands during a 30-story fall from some corporate building in Computer City.I was really amazed at just how good this little Noir crime thriller actually was! The acting, cinematography, direction, story-line, all top-notch. And for 3 henchmen we get Neville Brand, Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam all in the same movie! It doesn't get any better than that!...I wasn't expecting much and it floored me.They often say that you remember movies viewed in your youth with a certain fondness that rapidly dissolves into reality when rewatching that same film many years later. Well, the exact opposite is the case here. As an impressionable lad KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL left no enduring mark on my psyche. Viewing it many years later left me stunned that such a great B-film could be made in 1952, looking so fresh and "new", especially when compared against the current video-game action crap that we're forced to digest today.Buy this film, the MGM dvd only.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I know that alot of reviewers (myself included) have put down ALPHA dvds due to bad source prints and will continue to do so (myself included), however, quite alot of their dvds continue to amaze me...MY PAL TRIGGER, CAUSE FOR ALARM, IMPACT, D.O.A., and several others are really top-notch and super bargains!This BUFFALO BILL JR. (Jay Wilsey) double feature ranks in that super bargain range. Both features are very watchable quality wise considering the age of the source material, and are very interesting from an historical perspective.SUPER CHEAPLY made, that somehow, in a weird way adds to the entertainment value. So, if you're an old time fan of such stuff, or a greenhorn to the B-Western genre, then this is a really good buy. What we have here are two very very low budget westerns of the mid-1930's, they almost come off as home movies.1.)RAWHIDE ROMANCE(1934) directed by the infamous father of 1960's schlock Al Adamson, Victor Adamson, aka Denver Dixon. This stars Wilsey as ranch hand Buck Cartwright and Genee Bontell (his real life wife) as the spoiled brat Easterner who is won over by Buck as he saves the Dude Ranch she and her family are staying at while bandits sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes waiting for someone to rob. Bizarre...2.)THE TEXAN (1932) my favorite of the two as Wilsey is not the goody-goody hero, but rather a scam artist involved in Lafe McKee's plot to rig a horse race and make off with a bundle. Wilsey, or rather, Buffalo Bill Jr., sees the error in his ways and makes all right!All in all, a great look at super low budget Independent Film making for the B-Western film market of the 1930's.Great stuff, excellent source prints, great historical value for anyone concerned.I have to here and now congradulate ALPHA Video for making such stuff available for the home dvd/video market. I know of no other dvd company out there offering such a wide selection of B-Westerns for home entertainment that ALPHA does. They run the range from Bob Steele to Ken Maynard to Rex Bell to Hoot Gibson to The Range Busters to Tom Keene to Wally Wales to Tex Ritter to Bob Custer etc, etc.And in summation for this BUFFALO BILL JR. double bill; a MUST-HAVE for fans of these action programmers! Great product, Great packaging, Great fun! A Super Bargain purchase!!!

It doesn't get any better than this! Camp cult favorite John Agar stars in his best 50's sci-fi role ever, that of Gor-possessed Steve March! He's nice and bland and bad and dangerously over-the-top all in the same movie. He blows up planes and test sites laughing insanely to the delight of every hardcore fan of campy schlock!Produced by cinematographer Jacques Marquette this film has much in common with his ATTACK OF THE 50FT. WOMAN, produced the same year and no doubt shot back to back. Both feature the same locations, even the same shot of the car in the opening of 50FT. appears in BRAIN when Sally (Joyce Meadows) and her father drive into the desert to investigate where Steve and Dan(Robert Fuller) disappeared for a week. Both films were directed by Nathan Juran (as Hertz). And both films even feature some rather risky kissing, lurid and sexy!John Agar, my favorite 1950's sci-fi/horror actor (my God, he was in almost everything!)is perfect as the alien controlled victim, finally getting to play opposite his straight-arrow image in so many of these films (TRANTULA, MOLE PEOPLE, ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE,etc.), and he really appears to be enjoying it as well!A classic of it's kind THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS has to be seen to be appreciated...or at least believed.Once Gor is defeated and killed and Steve March reverts back to his good ol' self, he certainly has a lot of explaining to do to the Army brass who saw him destroy planes and kill people at random...." I really didn't do it, you see I was taken over by this floating alien brain from the planet Arous and he made me kill all those people!!!"...Great stuff.

The print used by ALPHA for KING OF THE WILD is quite acceptable, visually clear with decent audio, surprisingly good for a serial of this age (1931, one of Mascot's early talkies). The first chapter is somewhat misframed, heads chopped off while actors speak, but every chapter thereafter is very watchable with Mascot doing an exceptional job handling the transition to sound.Also doing a good transition to sound is main lead Walter Miller, the #1 male silent serial star, who along with Allene Ray, were the serial team of the silents, starring together in over a dozen of them! Miller, as the 1930's rolled on, moved into character and heavy roles in countless Westerns and sound serials. My favorite Miller role from this period was his potrayal of Johnny Mack Brown's compadre Deacon in RUSTLERS OF RED DOG. Miller died in 1940 as a result of staging a rough fight scene in a Gene Autry movie. He was hospitalized and died of a heart attack. He was only 49 yrs. old.Boris Karloff is featured quite prominently in this serial getting a lot of screen time and dialogue. He plays a renegade Arab looking for a diamond field. It's a good sinister role for Karloff and should please his fans.Former silent Western star/heavy Tom Santschi is badguy Harris framing our hero for a murder in India, the serial moving quickly to Africa for the remaining chapters. Santschi died in 1931, not long after appearing in KING OF THE WILD.As for the serial itself, it moves along at a pretty good clip, better than most due to the exotic locales, a neat "mystery killer", and being a fine example of an early sound serial.And as I mentioned before, the ALPHA source material is much better than expected and on 1 disc at a bargain price, it is certainly a bargain indeed!

First, congradulations on giving the fans a first-rate release on Season 1, pristine copies of an extraordinary tv series. Now, I'm not sure what the delay is in releasing further installments, but I, for one, am chomping at the bits for Season 2!And from reading other other posts on AMAZON, I'm not alone.Perhaps other things have come up and delays have put SEASON 2 on the back burner, I don't know. However, ALPHA DVD has a bazillion of their poorly produced, faded, splicy prints available, so there must be a "market" for this outstanding program....I really want you, Paramount, to please release the remaining ONE STEP BEYOND episodes in the same SUPER-QUALITY packaging as you did with Season 1....and if you don't, well, I do have certain paranormal connections that...Let's just leave it at that.

Just finished watching this 15-chapter five hour serial and boy did it pass quickly! That's because it's action-packed and filled with interesting characters. Johnny Mack Brown made several of these UNIVERSAL serials in the 1930's and they're all very good and you should try to get as many as possible as they're mostly offered from VCI ENTERTAINMENT (OREGON TRAIL, RUSTLERS OF RED DOG) and look just perfect. FLAMING FRONTIERS has great definition, background depth (you can see the river shimmer and flow in the background as badguy Charlie King ponders the next outlaw move) and a general overall sharpness and clarity that is really quite outstanding for a 1930's serial!...No plot synopsis here for a 15-chapter serial. All you need to know is that the VCI version is THE ONE to get. Great serial, great product.

I saw this as an impressionable young tyke & it's gastly images still hold root.Played in a pretty straight-forward sombre tone this sci-fi thriller shocked me right off in the opening sequence when the Navy diver...well, no sense spoiling anything... And a wife's loss of her husband is certainly more touching than most of what this genre offers.And it's these little touches that make this offering somewhat more realistic than let's say, THE GIANT CLAW.Good acting, good direction and an interesting story keep this moving right along. Hero Tim Holt is not your ordinary military type; he's revealed to be more humanistic, awkward at times, uncomfortable in the romantic situations, unsure of his actions yet determined to put an end to THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD!I fondly remember Holt with actor Richard Martin in an earlier series of B-Westerns in which they usually played Tim & Chito respectively. These were lots of fun and should be checked out by those who may be interested.THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD is a very well-made example of 1950's Horror/Sci-fi.,competently made and executed on all levels.And the MGM print is EXCELLENT!!This is a must-have.

This is the one you want! A complete un-cut extremely good looking print of the Roy Rogers classic. Yes, all the songs are here including several variations of the main title. I've seen other versions of LIGHTS/SANTA FE running under 60min. and they're missing chunks of storyline!!!Roy & The Sons of the Pioneers sign on with Dale & Gabby's rodeo which is plumb out of playing dates due to competitor Richard (former cowboy star Tom Keane) Powers' rival rodeo. Roy saves both the rodeo & Dale from marrying the crook! Roy Barcroft is great as the lead henchman and Shug Fisher is around for the laughs.So, if you want a clear/sharp intact version of LIGHTS OF OLD SANTA FE get the ALPHA dvd, the one with ALL the songs. Complete. Period.ABSOLUTE NECESSARY VIEWING.

Three of the most notorious, (hard to find on vhs) sci-fi camp classics from the 50's packaged together in one set makes this purchase an absolute neccessity for baby boomers who grew up on this stuff and lovers of low-budget trash!Saw 50 FOOT WOMAN at the theater and as a child believed that the transparency of the spaceship and the alien was on purpose to show how he can disappear into the desert at will and that Nancy Archer became the same due to radiation! This one is my favorite of the three.Saw GIANT BEHEMOTH at the theater and thought it very well-made with good acting, interesting locations and scary situations. Certainly not as juvenile as to what I was used to at the time. It's still the best of the three.Saw QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE on tv a bazzillion times during the 60's and still love it's wackiness and lack of logic. The color here is just great and the film comes off like a poor Star Trek episode. This one is certainly the most fun of the three.Great prints, great packaging and a great bargain!Buy and enjoy...You really can't go wrong here.

If you're just starting out into COOL JAZZ then there is no better place to begin than here! Mancini defines the genre through PETER GUNN, MR. LUCKY, CHARADE, & THE PINK PANTHER, wonderfully GREAT film (TV) music that reflected the mood & feeling of the WEST COAST jazz scene. Yeah, it's neat, it's cool, it's MANCINI!!!...Go on to Stan Getz, Mulligan, Brubeck,etc...but begin the journey here, with something that you're familiar with, outstanding film music that leaves you craving for that OH SO COOL sound that only fantasy alone can successfully transport you into...into the realm of TV detectives , spy-types, etc...into the world of Henry Mancini & the COOL SOUNDS of a long lost era....

One reviewer, Dave, wonders why episodes featured only one of the main stars each week; a Virginian episode with no Trampas, followed next week by a Trampas episode with no Virginian, etc. This was mostly because of mounting costs to produce a weekly 90 minute color tv series that attempted to be as close to a feature film as possible. Stories featuring singular stars were shot at the same time so that a product could be delivered for weekly broadcast in a timely fashion. Somtimes a star would pop in briefly at the beginning or the end of the other star's episode or Judge Garth would be there to tie it all together. Many shows of that time did the same, including NBC's THE NAME OF THE GAME and ABC's COMBAT and MAVERICK. It not only gave the networks a chance to showcase it's stars individually, but more importantly it enabled the studio to shoot two episodes in the same time it would take to do one.As for the series itself, THE VIRGINIAN was always one my favorites. I liked the idea of a 90 minute movie-like format. James Drury was perfect as the title character and my favorite of the show, though I remember the rest of my family preferring the Doug McClure Trampas episodes. The stories and guest stars always made the series " movie quality ", a fine example of television's Golden Age.Series regular L.Q. Jones does an interview for this set. He was a fixture in Western tv shows and films especially during the 60's and it's always great to hear his comments. I met L.Q. briefly in the early 1970's when he was in Youngstown, Ohio premiering his own produced film THE BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN at the Boardman Plaza theater. He was staying at the Voyager Motor Inn in downtown Youngstown and a friend and myself went over to get an autograph. L.Q. invited us to dinner, during which he explained how Sam Peckinpah shot the Battle of Bloody Porch ending to THE WILD BUNCH. He also talked about Sam's insistence on proper uniforms in MAJOR DUNDEE, Strother Martin, Warren Oates and filming THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE. L.Q. picked up the tab for the meal and I still have my autographed copy of THE WILD BUNCH paperback which he signed for me. A class act if ever there was one, and a special treat to have his interview on this set.

I recently purchased several " HAPPY TRAILS THEATER " Roy Rogers movies on dvd & I'm now doubting my better judgement. It was the AUTHORIZED BY THE ROY ROGERS ESTATE & DIGITALLY RESTORED statements that motivated my purchase...PLEASE, DO NOT FALL for this gimmick advertising. Maybe THE ROY ROGERS ESTATE doesn't know any better...but it should!!!This is an extremely heavily edited version of a very good Republic Western. The dvd case states approx. 65min. Roy & Dale yak with director William Whitney for at least 10min. of that time cutting the film length to under an hour.Now I have nothing against Roy & Dale recalling old times, actually I like it, but not if it means I have to watch a choppy version of UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS to compensate for time loss??? on a dvd???GOODTIMES VIDEO/DVD took an old TV-edited version of Roy & Dale's HAPPY TRAILS THEATER PROGRAM and slapped it onto a dvd without restoring all the missing parts that had been cut out for commercials...you can easily spot the commercial " fades ".The cuts & jumps were jarring & confusing...Luckily I have a 20-MOVIE PACK of Roy Rogers films on 4-dvd's from MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT that has a version of UNDER WESTERN STARS listing at 70min. I put this version on right after watching the HAPPY TRAILS version and I must say that results were astounding!!!MILL CREEK's is most likely as complete a version as you will find. Right from the BEGINNING...HAPPY TRAILS jumps into Roy fighting make-believe on a movie set...MILL CREEK starts the picture off with a great establishing shot of what is most likely REPUBLIC STUDIOS before Roy's intro...& all through the MILL CREEK version you catch a second here, a minute there, several complete scenes here and there. All the songs are intact as well including Roy & THE PIONEERS singing " DUST " at Roy's coming home party ( Roy ends the song with his great line " ...and may the good Lord take a likin' to you."...which, of course is all missing from the HAPPY TRAILS version ). Another missing song, the theme title " UNDER WESTERN STARS " sung duet by Roy & Jane Frazee also appears in the MILL CREEK version. To cut the title theme song is a statement in itself as to HAPPY TRAIL's lack of care in product presentation!!!As for what version " LOOKS & SOUNDS BETTER ", you would have to be nit-picking to favor HAPPY TRAILS...both look fine for a Tru-Color film & the MILL CREEK version is just as acceptable.For money value, the MILL CREEK 4-disc set is worth it alone for a MUCH MORE complete version of " UNDER WESTERN STARS " by about 20min & 2 songs.However, MILL CREEK's version of " LIGHTS OF OLD SANTA FE " runs under 60min & is a cut version...so this is not a perfect world.HAPPY TRAILS VERSION: 1 star.MILL CREEK VERSION: 5 stars.Compare them yourself, you'll see.

Along with THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., this is probably my favorite TV show from the 1960's. The print source here is much better than I remember it on our family consol; vivid, clear, bright, sharp...maybe we just had a bad tv set??? This is great period sci-fi & lots of fun(especially spotting the guest stars!). However, I'm not a huge fan of double-sided dvds as they tend to wear & skip when played often...but for VOYAGE, I guess I'll make an exception. SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

A wonderful collection of Russian Easter hymns, bells chiming the introductions! Beautiful, earthy. I've played this every Easter for the past 10 years, along with Glazunov's KING OF THE JEWS (CHANDOS cd)...tradition.As to why Russian music I have no answer except that this is very Holy music in setting and feeling and seems so very fitting of the occasion...I enjoy it and feel that you will too.EMI CLASSICS offers MUSIC FOR HOLY WEEK by the Choir of King's College, Cambridge which features an outstanding version of the beautiful hymn JESUS CHRIST IS RISEN TODAY, and is perfect as a sort-of set-up for this Easter Day recording.So, if you're exploring options for sacred Easter music for the Holy Day/Week then please consider the selections I've offered.One doesn't have to understand Russian to experience the power of this musical offering. It's all part of having a wonderful Easter season.

A RANGE BUSTERS masterpiece? Like in MASTERPIECE THEATER? Not likely, but then again, that depends on the viewer. Stacked up against all of the other RANGE BUSTER films this is certainly one of my favorite ( masterpieces )!It seems that shortly after the Civil War banking speculators are attempting to corner the gold market. President Grant, to prevent such a fiasco, commandeers the Range Busters into looking into such illegal doings. So they ride off to some low-budget studio backlot and take matters into hand.What's really great here is that Max Terhune gets quality screen time, as he rides off ahead of Crash and Dusty to scope things out. Traveling as a peddler gives Max and Elmer, his puppet, ample opportunity to strut their stuff, meaning jibs 'n jabs back and forth that are really quite witty and very funny.Needless to say, the Range Busters uncover the underground tunneling attempt to steal the gold and arrest Tom London, Steve Clark and other well-loved henchmen and bosses.The ALPHA print used here is really quite good. There are some cut/splices, but the overall image is very clear with exceptional sound.So if you love the Range Busters like me, then this is a MUST HAVE. For fans of Elmer, he should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor by a puppet in a dramatic, but not very serious, role.Great viewing pleasure, enjoy.

This is why I buy movies, two somewhat obscure yet competently made thrillers of the PSYCHO-era (late 1950's, early 1960's) appearing on dvd together from out of the public domain netherland!Though STARK FEAR mentions that some picture anomalies are present due to the rarity of the film source I was quite pleased with overall product and didn't find myself disturbed in any way by a dark/light, jumpy/splicy print. The picture image and sound quality seemed no worse than any other public domain release and I didn't even notice the so-called "warning" until after I had seen the film and was then reading the box art.Both films in my opinion (not that that's worth much) are gems of low budget film making, and as I stated above, that's exactly why I search out such things as this double bill dvd.Imagine...FRIGHT being made by a major Hollywood studio at the time. I'm sure that's what the screenwriter had hoped for. And it would have worked if Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward had been cast in the lead roles with Hitchcock directing. I'm just suggesting that this could have been a very well known film and possible classic under the right circumstances. Eric Fleming and Nancy Malone are quite exceptional in their roles, much better than one would or should expect from a low budgeted film. And I've seen director Wilder's KILLERS FROM SPACE and PHANTOM FROM SPACE and though I like those films in a schlocky kind of way, I must say that his direction here seems much more polished and on a more professional par as he's able to draw good performances from all cast members.Eric Fleming, a psychiatrist, becomes involved with Nancy Malone, a woman who may or may not be possessed by the spirit of an 19th century Austrian baroness. But then again it just may be a case of multiple personality disorder. Or is it really reincarnation? You have to see it to find out for yourself, though I will say again that handled by a major studio this has all the makings of another MARNIE or something similar.As for STARK FEAR, this is another winner. Beautiful and talented Beverly Garland who should have been a major actress of her day is the abused suffering housewife of psycho hubby Skip Homeier (one of the classic psycho/killer types of his generation), who after Skip skips, goes looking for him back in his old home town only to get raped and abused by a really frightening lowlife. There's lots of gritty realism and sadism in this one but it's all very compelling, and once again, if only a major studio had taken on this property this may have become a well known classic, but for now it just has to settle for being a minor somewhat lost film.So what you have here are two minor low budget lost films seeing the light of day on a double bill dvd release. They both, given proper treatment, could have been major motion pictures. They certainly have the potential. I strongly urge that you buy this dvd and see exactly what I mean. The cost is low, the entertainment value is high. I really enjoyed this dvd alot. This is exactly what I look for and hope to find, the rare and obscure, that which has now become almost unheard of yet deserves attention...by someone.If you're a fan of PSYCHO, MARNIE, ...BABY JANE, THE THREE FACES OF EVE, etc. then you should enjoy these two lost minor classics. You at least deserve to see them.Buy & enjoy.

I've been so tempted to purchase Sam Peckinpah's DEADLY COMPANIONS from overseas (Region 2) as both the UK and Germany releases offer widescreen prints of this Western. Here in the US all we've ever gotten is the chopped-up, faded, blurry pan and scan version offered by dozens of cheap public domain companies. Seeing this film newly restored and in a widescreen presentation from VCI will be like seeing it for the first time. I, for one, can hardly wait.

...confusing, jarring, mind-numbing...existing in a dream-like state.PHANTOM OF THE WEST, filmed in 1930 & released in 1931 is perhaps the classic example of the motion picture serial in transition from silents to sound...it's images & characters like Phantoms themselves projected onto some giant movie screen in your mind...weird.It's as though someone with a home-movie camera went out and filmed these events, capturing a realistic look at the American West. But realistic this is not...It's more of a fantasy dream world.For example, when hero Jim Lester (Tom Tyler) is ambushed by a couple of thugs in Chapter 1, he fights it out with thug #1 (Joe Bonomo) and brings Bonomo in to the sheriff for questioning. When Bonomo is forced to reveal the secret identity of THE PHANTOM he is shot from ambush. Now, in the very next chapter Bonomo reappears in the bar fighting with a drunk & appears in all of the following chapters even though he has already been killed off...and he doesn't even bother to change his shirt or add a moustache...as if in a dream.Also, when THE PHANTOM is finally revealed we all know his identity cannot possibly be true because the character in question was seen in the company of others (earlier) when THE PHANTOM struck.Now, I'm not criticizing this creaky serial, I love this film!This was the first of the Mascot PHANTOM/MYSTERY/VILLAINS and/or SECRET/CLOAKED/NIGHT-RIDERS to come...THE VANISHING LEGION(1931), THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR(1931), FIGHTING WITH KIT CARSON(1933), MYSTERY MOUNTAIN(1934) & Gene Autry's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE(1935) folowed.And it's really great to catch a glimpse of the 1930's American West before urban sprawl...Most of these Poverty Row Productions could not afford expensive sound stages to shoot on and so they had to make due with the real thing, actual location shooting!I have both the VCI videotape and the ALPHA dvd and I compared them side-by-side and have come to the conclusion that both were taken from the same film source. All the scratches, wash-outs, jump-cuts, etc. are the same. However, this is really a great visual treat. Remember, this serial is from a cheap studio, but most images are sharp and surprisingly clear! I was amazed at the quality of this serial.If you are just starting out on serials then go first with the Republic classics from the late 1930's-early 1940's: DICK TRACY(1937), DAREDEVILS OF THE RED CIRCLE(1939), MYSTERIOUS DR. SATAN(1940), JUNGLE GIRL(1941), SPY SMASHER(1942)...there are lots to choose from.But if you want a classic example of the early roots of the sound serial, then this is your baby...& it's all just a dream...

Really good looking print of some really good looking German college girls being knocked off one by one! This has the feel of a James Bond movie; gadgets, bizarre deaths, mad scientists and a criminal mastermind. But perhaps it's Bond here who is the copycat, being himself influenced by the father of German Krimis, Dr. Mabuse, Fritz Lang's original Criminal Mastermind who set-up the plot standards for Bondish adventures and these German-made Edgar Wallace thrillers of the early to mid 1960's.The plot of COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is too outlandish to give any spoilers, yet is an oft repeated scenario, so much so in that the Chief inspector Sir John asks Detective Higgins about a similar past case to which Higgins replies, "...yes, the Sinister Monk.", the title of a previous entry in the series of Wallace Krimis...you REALLY need to see as many of these wonderful films as possible!Just don't take this too seriously. Keep an open mind to the body count and daft humor. This isn't GET SMART by any means but it isn't THE IPCRESS FILE either. It's just a good old fashioned murder mystery loaded with exploitation value. A good time can be had here for fans of Euro-mystery-trash. Great color, great soundtrack, lots of sexy girls in bathing suits, nice locations, abundant fog, dead bodies galore, mindless killings, and a red-hooded whip-brandishing maniac!....What's not to like?

I have a fondness for Tim McCoy's Lightin' Bill Carson westerns, especially when Tim goes undercover using a disguise to solve the case.This time the case takes 6 years as Tim/or Lightin' Bill becomes El Puma, a Robin Hood-like Mexican bandido. It seems Lightin' Bill was framed for a murder actually commited by Bad-Guy Link Benson (the great Ted Adams). So Bill goes undercover for 6 years...no matter, to get the goods on Benson in a 52 minute slam-bang, hard-ridin' fun-for-all action classic!I'd rather watch a quickly made no-holds-barred action western like THE FIGHTING RENEGADE any day over a so-called "classic" like HIGH NOON which has way too much talking and way too little action.McCoy is just great as usual! Ben Corbett plays his old partner "Magpie". Bud Buster plays "Old Dobie", Ace-heavy Ted Adams is perfect as Benson, Joyce Bryant is the heroine and dependable Dave O'Brien is her love interest. O'Brien (Texas Rangers series, CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT serial, DEVIL BAT etc.) always seemed on the verge of hitting it big and moving on to leading roles in A-features. He was charming, witty and had a winning "common-guy" appeal. He will always be one of my favorite low budget heroes!The ALPHA dvd is acceptable. Some scenes are a tad too dark but over-all it really looks pretty good with lots of sharp images.Remember,it's directed by penny-pinching cheapskate Sam Newfield, which means tons of low-budget action fun!!!Enjoy.

This review is for the Sept.25,2012 re-release of KINO's SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA. Reviews before this date are for the KINO product, this review is for the IMAGE re-release of the same material which is no longer available from KINO.This is really great stuff and needs to be made available, and IMAGE, as well as KINO, offers a superior product as noted by all of the other reviewers (pre 9-25).The bargain is that you get over 50 classic comedy shorts (over 18 hours!) on 5 dvds, and the price for this amounts to only a few bucks per disc, as AMAZON is currently listing this set at around 10 dollars. And the shorts look pretty good too! For years I've suffered with poor copies of these films on vhs with no or poor musical tracking. And with David Shepard and Joe Adamson involved, along with musical soundtracks by Robert Israel and others, you know you're in for a good ride.So far, so good...Then some bad news...Despite handsome packaging in a 3-part fold-away, the discs themselves are inserted into slits, which upon removal can cause damage and/or scratches to the dvds. I carefully removed mine without incident and put each disc into a seperate case to avoid future damage. None were scratched during the process.And despite a nice permanently-affixed booklet written by Joe Adamson on silent film comedy, no listing of any film or timing is ever given, on the product packaging or in the booklet. I guess you have to already know what KINO had previously released. Here, you just pop in a disc to see what comes up.Still, all in all, a GREAT SET at a GREAT PRICE and this one is very, very highly recommended.UPDATE*UPDATE*UPDATE* (11-7-12)With several reviewers citing defective discs I became concerned about mine as I've yet to encounter any problems. True, I have not yet watched every short here, but I did put in each disc and watched a short or two and they all played fine.One reviewer made special issue with disc 2, HIS MARRIAGE WOW stopping and ALL NIGHT LONG appearing as a blank monitor. So I played disc 2 completely through to see if it was indeed defective and it played just fine. HIS MARRIAGE WOW and ALL NIGHT LONG both just fine, no skipping, stalling, freezing, stopping or blank monitor.Got my set from Amazon when it first became available, so it was probably from the same batch as the other reviewers' sets.Because silent comedy shorts are not the most popular viewing subject in my household, I've been quarantined to watching these on my emachines computer which I bought at Walmart 14 months ago. Maybe that has something to do with it.All I know is that my set appears ok. Maybe for once I just got lucky.

I'm not putting down this book as it's one of my favorites, yet I've always wondered "...what it could have been..." given proper treatment. The book in question here is small and limited, though many locations are well represented, not only LAUREL & HARDY sites, but also LITTLE RASCAL/OUR GANG sites as well. The author did an outstanding job and this book is by my side when watching L&H and LITTLE RASCALS films, and I recommend it to all fans who don't already have a copy. Photos of sites and maps of locations, yet lacking the polished delivery that OUR BOYS truly need; more photos, better maps, expanded text and better paper quality....John Bengtson are you listening!!! With the (FINALLY) release of L&H's Hal Roach sound shorts & features to dvd this year a truly quality book of this type is sorely needed. Please, someone, make all of our wishes come true!

Love Roy & Dale and all their films, but I just can't stand it when my favorite cowboy films get all butchered up!... For some reason the song SUSANNA PASS went buzzing through my head the other day so I reached for this newly bought set to enjoy the movie. Now, the dvd states the running time as 67 minutes which is the correct running time for this movie. However, during the first 10 minutes I noticed that things just didn't seem quite right. Too many quick splice/cuts. And then when Roy arrives at the jailhouse early on after chasing an escaped convict I remembered that a song seemed to be missing. So when I pulled out my old REPUBLIC PICTURES vhs double bill of this film along with SONS OF THE PIONEERS I not only noticed that the video tape print was clearer with better color contrast, but also that there were no early splice cuts, snipping a couple seconds here and there. And best of all, as Roy arrives at the jailhouse, Estrelita Rodriguez is singing the song TWO GUN RITA which is not on this dvd version!!!Now I know that those in charge of marketing for the Roy Rogers estate claim that the songs were cut for tv release way back when and are now lost on the cutting room floor... So how come my old vhs tape from REPUBLIC PICTURES has the same movie intact running also at 67 minutes?It seems to me that the missing time ( cut songs ) were done so that Roy & Dale could host their HAPPY TRAILS THEATER on tv and talk to guest stars, in this case Gene Autry & Pat Buttram. I have nothing against yackin' about old times and kindda like seeing it as a bonus feature...but when it means cutting the songs out of a singing cowboy movie, it grates me somewhat!After all, according to the promo blurb for Roy & Dale's 4-disc cd collection of their movie songs "...It was always the music."!!!Then, if so, why cut the music?This film,and others, THE BELLS OF ROSARITA, UNDER CALIFORNIA STARS, etc are available uncut with all songs intact on cheap public domain lables, many of which offer better looking prints.Shop wisely and avoid any release that is tied into the ROY ROGERS HAPPY TRAILS tv product. They're all cut versions! They're all missing the songs!I love the songs and I love my movies uncut and I'm sorry to see such wonderful packaging wasted on such an inferior product.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!

ZUCCO LIVES!!!...AT LEAST AS A VAMPIRE, FOR A FEW DAYS.THIS IS A TOP-NOTCH PRC HORROR FILM ABOUT TWIN BROTHERS, ONE GOOD ONE BAD, AND BOTH PLAYED BY GEORGE ZUCCO, WHO HAS, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION, ALWAYS ADDED A TOUCH OF CLASS & SOPHISTICATION TO ABYSMAL POVERTY ROW DREK. IN DEAD MEN WALK ZUCCO PLAYS ELWYN CLAYTON, A SORTTA LOVECRAFTIAN TYPE WHO READS MYSTIC BOOKS OF FORBIDDEN LORE AND BECOMES A VAMPIRE AFTER HIS DEATH. ZUCCO IS ALSO DR. LLOYD CLAYTON, RESPONSIBLE FOR ELWLN'S DEATH & NOW HAS TO PAY FOR IT. DWIGHT FRYE SHINES AS ELWYN'S EVIL ASSISTANT & AL "FUZZY" ST.JOHN EVEN POPS IN AS A LOCAL RUBE. HAL PRICE PLAYS THE LOCAL LAW AS HE DID IN LUGOSI'S THE DEVIL BAT...CERTAINLY A FUN TIME FOR FANS OF LOW BUDGET 1940'S HORROR FILMS!!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.THE ALPHA DVD VERSION IS PRETTY GOOD, A NICE CLEAR PICTURE EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF OUTSIDE NIGHT SHOTS WHICH ARE A TAD TOO DARK, BUT THAT'S PROBABLY THE FAULT OF PCR'S SHODDY PRODUCTION VALUES. ALL IN ALL A GREAT BUY CONSIDERING THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE ALPHA PRODUCT.

Director Ty Garnett (THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE) makes the most of an almost no-budget situation and manages to turn out an amazingly well made neat little thriller... Yes, it has all the noir plot devices going for it, yet this film is LIGHT, filmed in broad daylight with sharp, crisp images! Loretta Young has probably never been better, and Barry Sullivan is as good as always! He has her post a letter accusing her of murdering him. He then dies trying to kill her...and now she must get back that damning letter!All I need to add is to insure you that the Alpha dvd is indeed TOP-NOTCH!!! Crisp, clear...as tho-it-had-been-shot yesterday quality!So, if you want to add this movie to your noir/mystery/murder catagory, do not hesitate to purchase this beautiful dvd!Super nice print, super affordible, SUPER RECOMMENDED!!!

...and so has my opinion. I purchased Weisser's book when it first came out in hardback, library-like binding, before McFarland went cheap in quality but not in price. Yes, this was the greatest read alongside Weldon's PSYCHOTRONIC ENCYCLOPEDIA for my hopes of searching out and finding tons of obscure movies. I made lists upon lists, visited mom & pop video stores and ordered through catalogs and magazines, no computer just yet. After collecting and viewing more and more Spaghetti Westerns I realised that I simply could not count on Weisser's information. He most likely never saw a great deal of the movies he reviewed because so much from cast listings to titles and even plots were incorrect. I was very disappointed with my nicely bound 500+ page encyclopedic tome......As I said, times have changed. Alot of Spaghetti Westerns are now becoming available with companies like WILD EAST offering great prints.A book like Weisser's needs to be re-done. Someone out there needs to do a massive comprehensive film guide. Maybe it's already in the works, I hope so.I really would like to have the book I thought I bought back in the early '90's.

This is just fantastic if you're a fan of B-Westerns. They're all here, all the stars of the old Cowboy Movies of the 1930's-40's. Buck, Tim, Roy, Gene, Lash, Hoppy, Hoot and the rest of the gang band together via film clips to destroy MYSTERY MOUNTAIN's super villain The Rattler. You get to see 'em all ride into town alone, meet at the saloon together, and engage in one of the best bar-room brawls ever commited to stock footage. This is only topped by the BIG running gunfight throughout town and the rounding up of all the badguys, including several Charlie King appearances!There's nothing quite like this. It just has to be seen to be appreciated. Super Highly Recommended!

...At least I thought so when I first saw this MASTERPIECE at the Colony Theater in Shaker Heights (Cleveland), Ohio back in the early 1980's ( I still have the program guide ). It ran nearly 4 hours!!! I was mezmorized. It was presented by Francis Ford Coppola of GODFATHER fame. The score was by Francis's father Carmine Coppola, which I thought was fantastic!!!Please, Francis...if somehow you are preventing the future release of a superior version of this great masterpiece simply because of legal rights pending your father's score, then shame on you many times over!!! Get it done!!! You've got the money, you've got the fame...I've even enjoyed DEMENTIA 13!!!! & I want to see as complete a version of this film as possible!!! I loved your father's score. I bought the album. I bought the cd. It will probably always be THE NAPOLEON SCORE to me as well as to others!!!Francis,...I really want the most complete version of Abel Gance's NAPOLEON as possible...Don't screw this up.

KRONOS is presented here in a really outstanding (Wade Williams IMAGE version) dvd, with crisp, sharp detail. This is a 1950s must have, as the huge energy sucking monster from outer space simply cannot be stopped!...or can it? This is indeed one of the better examples of the era. Better than THE GIANT CLAW (what isn't?), though not as good as FORBIDDEN PLANET (what is?). On par with EARTH VS FLYING SAUCERS, and that means pretty good! And if you check out the SCREEN ARCHIVES web site you can now purchase the Paul Sawtell soundtrack to this classic.

Absolutely the the most complete book of it's type available, and a definate must have for fans of 1960's Euro-spy flicks. The authors have tracked down and reviewed countless examples of the genre. You'll get reviews of such classics as FROM ISTANBUL, ORDERS TO KILL; FX 18 SUPERSPY; KISS THE GIRLS AND MAKE THEM DIE; LSD, HELL FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE; LUCKY THE INSCRUTABLE; MARK DONEN AGENT Z7; MISSION BLOODY MARY; THE SECOND BEST SECRET AGENT IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORD; and YPOTRON aka MISSION SECRETE POUR LEMMY LOGAN, among many others. You'll meet all the top agents of their time; Jerry Cotton, OSS 117, Lemmy Caution, Joe Walker, Francis Coplan, Charles Vine, The Monocle, Agent 3S3, 077, The Tiger and James Tont. The plots are over the top, the soundtracks groovey and the scantily-clad Euro-spy babes beautiful and deadly. This is entertainment value at it's highest "cheese" factor. And speaking of cheese, if you were one of the lucky few to have read author Matt Blake's outstanding Eurotrash fanzine CHEESEPLANT then you know what a great time you're in for.Both Blake and co-author David Deal take turns reviewing the 150+ mostly low (to no) budget spy films presented here, offering tons of info and personal observations. Their writing style is intiment, down to earth, as though a friend were telling you of some must-see movie, or warning you of bad trash. You also get a listing of the series films, a spy biography, an actors, directors, composers cross reference and top ten listings of spies, films, villains etc. And it's all well illustrated with many poster and lobby card photos.This is one of the best film books I own, and if you (like me) can't get your fill of Euro-spy/police/horror/giallo/trash then you're definately in need of this book too!

This set contains 1/2 of the listed episodes on the 20 dvd package featuring the same cover artwork from Brentwood. However, if you're like me and prefer your stuff on a single-sided disc then you will be happy with this set. I strongly recommend this set. Most episodes are extremely watchable on pretty good transfers. I really don't think that there is a better value out there (quality wise) for fans of old Dragnet (the b&w; stuff) episodes. AND IT'S ON 2 ONE-SIDED DVDS!!!!!!Buy & enjoy!!!

Some have called this the worst B-Western ever made. It's pretty bad, but like most of these early 1930's no-budget talkies, it has a strangeness about it that I like. It's kind of like watching a home movie featuring grown-ups playing cowboys.The acting is either very broad or nonexistent, with Pat Carlyle's Irish Gringo performance being very much the former as he hams his way to the point of annoyance. The "make it up as you go along" plot has to do with a map of the Lost Dutchman gold mine being drawn onto a shirt that a little girl wears when grandpa gets shot and she wanders off only to come upon The Irish Gringo and his pals who save her. Lots of riding and chases take place to fill in the rest of the short running time.The director is credited as William C. Thompson (his only effort) being best known as cameraman on Ed Wood Jr's many terrible films (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, among others). This film has the look and feel of an Ed Wood movie, though Pat Carlyle himself may have directed some of it. Carlyle doesn't give himself billing credit in this or the earlier CALL OF THE COYOTE (1934) in which he pretty much plays the same character, Don Adios. Too humble or too embarrassed?However, I did enjoy watching this mish-mash for whatever insane reason that I just cannot explain. And I especially enjoyed the final gunfight between the Irish Gringo and the leader of the badguys. They back away from each other, counting, poised to draw, when...No spoilers here. You've got to sit through this thing to find out, but I'll tell you this: it's one of my favorite scenes in B-Westerns.

Yes, two Sartana movies on one single-sided dvd. And boy do they look great! Both features are uncut widescreen anamorphic presentations with bold crisp colors that just pop off the screen.SARTANA'S HERE... is by far the better of the two and is a kind of send-up on Spaghetti Westerns in general, Sartana in particular. This is a light hearted movie with plenty of violence and killing. It's played straight, but with tongues planted firmly in cheeks. Not a comedy, but it'll have you laughing as Sartana and Sabbath perform impossible feats of gunplay while making it all seem so everyday commonplace. George Hilton and Charles Southwood are perfect in the leads for director Anthony Ascot and all three made another film, GUNS AND DOLLARS, which is pretty much a continuation of the same.DJANGO AGAINST SARTANA is the more serious film and as such it's laughs are unintentional, but they're there. The plot involves Django going after his brother's killers and he wrongly believes Sartana responsible. Django and Sartana then team up to set things straight. Not really a bad movie, but not very good either. When Django and Sartana go into their macho posturing they're more funny than threatening, the complete opposite of SARTANA'S HERE...when Sartana and Sabbath do it, LOOK OUT, they're gonna kick butt and you believe it, they're just too cool.So, all in all, this is really another great release by WILD EAST. A double barrel blast of Spaghetti Westerns. Great looking releases that are a must have for all collectors of this stuff. Get it now before this one goes out of print because WILD EAST doesn't seem to reissue their past releases once they're sold out.Lots of killings, great music, five stars.

BOY, THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT DOUBLE FEATURE WITH " THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE " !!! BOTH FILMS (IN BLACK & WHITE) FEATURE DISEMBODIED HEADS RESTING ATOP TABLES PLEADING TO BE TERMINATED. BOTH FEATURE CRAZY, WACKED OUT OVER-THE-TOP MAD SURGEONS THAT VISIT STRIP JOINTS IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT BODY. BOTH LAY THICK THE SLEAZE, THE SMOKY NIGHTSPOTS, THE MOODY/JAZZ UNDERBELLY OF SOCIETY...DISGUSTING, DEPRAVED,...JUST WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A TRASHY 1950/60'S ARTSIE EUROPEAN SCHLOCKER!!! WITH SET DESIGNS BY HERMAN (DR. CALIGARI) WARM THAT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING FROM "DR.MABUSE MEETS FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT".STAR HORST FRANK WOULD GO ON IN THE 1960'S TO BECOME A MASTER VILLIAN/SCUMBAG IN EUROTRASH, ESPECIALLY SPAGHETTI WESTERNS (VIVA DJANGO/GET THE COFFIN READY; BIG SHOWDOWN; MOMENT TO KILL; ETC...)AND THE HEAD HIMSELF, MICHEL SIMON IS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS ROLE AS THE STUBBORN OLD TRAIN ENGINEER WHO GETS SHOT BY THE NAZIS IN JOHN FRANKENHEIMER'S "THE TRAIN" (1965).THE ALPHA DVD IS VERY ACCEPTIBLE, QUITE CLEAR WITHOUT ANY HARSH AUDIO NOISE...A FEW SCRATCHES, SPLICES, NOTHING ANNOYING OR TO GET WORRIED ABOUT...A PRETTY DECENT TRANSFER OVERALL.

Quite surprised with this obscure Russian Christmas/Fairy tale which features a witch and the devil causing mayhem during the holiday season. The witch captures stars from the night sky and the devil has it in for the local blacksmith who has painted a rather insulting image of the devil being made to look ludicrous by the church. In order to gain approval and win in hand the young maiden, the blacksmith must procure a pair of royal slippers/shoes to present to his beloved, who appears a bit standoff-ish if you ask me!All in all, a whimsical Christmas (in color) fairy tale for the entire family to enjoy...odd and enjoyable, strange yet familiar. Recommended.

Young, innocent sweet Emily De Blancheville returns home to her creepy family castle to celebrate her 21st birthday, which, unknown to her, is destined not to happen. A family curse has driven her disfigured father insane and he plans to murder Emily, hence the plot which I won't give away.This film was shot (in b&w;) during the fall/winter (no snow yet no leaves). It's cold, creepy & very gothic with lots of artsy camera shots, especially during the premature burial scene, reminiscent of Dreyer's VAMPYR.The acting is very good with both the brother and the doctor giving their best Vincent Price impersonations. And the maid is the real hottie, in a perverse sort of way.A very nice entry into the Euro-Gothic-Horror genre, well done and very enjoyable, and the ALPHA dvd is quite good as well, very watchable and most likely a complete print.You even get to see brother Roderick play Bach's Toccata and Fugue during one of his moodier moments. Now what can be more gothic than that?Recommended viewing.

This review is posted to serve as an alert for potential buyers of this new release. The 5-star rating that I've given this product is for VCI's past record in bringing us QUALITY dvd restorations of beat-up serials, especially UNIVERSAL serials, of which many have had poor vhs releases or no release at all. I'm sure that this release will meet all of VCI's excellent past standards.PAY NO ATTENTION to any review posted before Feb.14, 2012, the release date of this NEW version. Those reviews are not for this product. Those are reviews for bad vhs releases of questionable quality.Having a nicely restored version of DON WINSLOW OF THE COAST GUARD can turn a badly beat-up serial into an entirely new viewing experience. And I'm sure that VCI will not let us fans down. They have a track record for excellence.***UPDATE***UPDATE***UPDATE***EXCELLENT RESTORATION!!! as expected...This is definately a keeper for your serial library. GREAT JOB VCI!!!

Another outstanding ROUGH RIDERS adventure as our heroes avenge the murder of marshal Gordon and recover the stolen Garcia jewels while redeeming bad guy Dennis Moore. Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton shine as usual as U.S. MARSHALS, Buck Roberts, Tim McCall and Sandy Hopkins. They drift into town alone as strangers, interact on the sly with one another, then come together to close the net on the bad guys in the final reel. This is the set-up for all entries in this outstanding series, and BELOW THE BORDER is one of their best, with supporting help from a fine cast of outlaws including Roy Barcroft (boss heavy), Charlie King, Bud Osborn and Kermit Maynard. Jack Rockwell plays his sheriff routine down pat.I played the ALPHA dvd on my pc and it appeared somewhat soft, but when I minimized the image it really looked pretty good with good contrast. Not too many splices and/or glitches, which is good. I can recommend this version to fans. The price is right and the entertainment value here can't be beat, even by the ROUGH RIDERS!!!

I'm not sure what a previous reviewer was watching, but this ALPHA release is just great; a nice crisp, clear print in sepia tone, which doesn't bother me as long as the image is sharp! Lots of gunfights and chases, great stuff! And Denny Moore gets to star!!! He reminds me alot of Kermit Maynard; straight and narrow guys who had a brief fling at starring roles but always seemed to end up as some third henchman in an outlaw gang with little or no lines, let alone anything to do, other than to get shot and die before 60 minutes are up. However, here Moore holds his own and proves himself to be a capable leading man, easy-going yet tough, delivering his lines well with some sense of wit and charm.So if you like Universal or just plain Western serials you can't go wrong here. And Lionel Atwill, Regis Toomey, Joe Sawyer, and Jack Ingram are on hand to provide action and thrills...Love it!!!

Who, you may ask, is Ben Corbett? Well, he's a character actor that's appeared in countless B-Westerns on both sides of the law. He's probably best known as "MAGPIE" in a series of Tim McCoy's LIGHTENIN' BILL CARSON oaters. He's the second bananna/sidekick who holds his own and helps things along. He's middle-aged, rather dumpy with a potbelly, but manages to get things done.In the first movie here, Bill Cody's BORDER MENACE (1934), Ben plays the guy in the cell that relates through flashback how Bill Cody set him up in order to infiltrate the gang. Ben escapes in enough time to expose Cody as the two-timin', back-stabbin' hero that he is. George Chesebro shines as chief henchie Chuck Adams (there should've been an Academy Award for guys like Chesebro!) And, YES, once again Bill Cody's hat is way-TOO BIG for his head. He even removes it in an action scene!In movie #2, CIRCLE OF DEATH (1935), Ben plays the chief henchman who, in a running gag, keeps getting tied up to his horse all the time. Ben Corbett is an ordinary average-looking kindda paunchy guy who is just plain likable. He just happens to be a dastardly thug in both of these films.In CIRCLE OF DEATH, Monte Montana, a somewhat wooden actor, does ok as a white child brought into adulthood by Indians who adopted him after attacking and destroying a wagon train heading for the promised land. I liked this one better, but that's really just a personal preference.In the world of B-Westerns, plot matters little. What you need to know here is that both (ALPHA dvd) movies look pretty good, are somewhat clear with an audible track that doesn't sound as if it's been submerged under the Atlantic ocean. The usual scratches, jumps, cuts, etc., exist.A TRUE Ben Corbett film-fest double feature!Buy this affordable treat and experience Ben Corbett in two high profile roles. 5 STARS, for content and bullet count!

Saw this at the drive-in when it first came out and remembered it as being a somewhat sub-standard Western, kind of a Spaghetti Western/Sam Peckinpah wannabe, and though that may be true, THE WRATH OF GOD does have a few slight merits of it's own.First is Robert Mitchum's performance as the sleepy-eyed priest who mows 'em down Django-fashion with a hidden machine gun. He scoffs the Lord, swears, drinks whiskey, smokes cigars and kills. Back then, I thought it just a ruse, now, I'm not too sure. Is he taking this "Fatherhood" seriously, or is it all just part of the scam? Certainly one of Mitchum's best roles, though not nearly as great as his other heavenly outing in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Still, food for thought.Secondly, Victor Buono finally gets to play a somewhat good-guy, or at least be on Mitchum's side. He's a likable lout in the George Sanders fashion, a con man who is always looking out for himself, yet leads a courageous attack on the enemy stronghold, driving a battering-ram car while machine-gunning the fodder that stands in his way. He actually has voice-over thoughts to justify his actions.And thirdly, we get some social comment throughout the film on third-world oppression. Executions are abundant and viewed with disgust. The masses are left with no meaning to life..., that is until Mitchum rebuilds the church and gives strength, support and dignity to the downtrodden, then defends it all with a machine gun.Strange, weird.Rita Hayworth is wasted as the mother of Frank Langella, who likes to kill priests. Also lots of familiar Peckinpah faces here, Aurora Clavel, Jorge Russek and even that old man with the white beard that appeared in THE WILD BUNCH and was mowed down by Gig Young and Robert Webber in BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA is on board.And nudity...two scenes bare-assed, but not of a woman. Co-star Ken Hutchinson, who gives a pretty good performance in yet another complex role as a lout who re-thinks his situation (this movie is full of 'em) does the nude scenes. No nude women? Like I said...Strange, weird.All in all, certainly not as bad as I had remembered it to be, actually quite good and really quite entertaining. And the wide screen dvd from Warner bros. offers a nice transfer, great color & sound. So if you need to fill in that gap between Spaghetti Westerns and American Westerns influenced by Spaghetti Westerns (EL CONDOR, BARQUERO, etc.) then this is certainly a must have for your collection. The perfect example of a movie taken for granted when first released.Also, Lalo Schifrin's offbeat soundtrack is currently available at the SCREEN ARCHIVES website.

I thought I was in for another exploitation laugh-fest but this little swamp gem caught me off guard. The lead characters are all interesting and somewhat offbeat, as is the setting, a small Louisiana parish nestled in the bayou, making this one fun to watch. If this film had taken place in some small California town, it would lose much of it's unique low-budget charm.The Guillot brothers, suppliers of fish, fur and moss (as posted on their shanty) are at each other's throats because the younger, Pierre (Robert Richards) is marrying the pretty girl (Betty Lynn, Thelma Lou of Mayberry) that both he and his brother Jacques (Peter Coe) are in love with. Pierre scrubs down for his big event by jumping into the swamp next to the shanty for a bath and shave. No running water here. When he asks Jacques to please attend the ceremony he receives a solid punch to the jaw. Jacques and the brothers' old helper/employee go moss gathering on their barge/boat instead. Out in the swamp they come across unconscious Minette (Nan Peterson, THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON's piano playing nightclub singer) who has been found by some old swamp crone, who steals Minette's rings which have been stolen by Minette herself. Anyway, they take Minette back to town just as the wedding service is ending in front of some church about the size of a garage. Most of those in attendance are wearing wrinkled skirts, flannel shirts, ballcaps etc. It's decided that Minette should stay with the newlyweds (no one else offers) until she recovers. The doc, not the police is sent for.While unknown to Thelma Lou (I'll call her that because I can't recall her name in the film, besides, I swear she wears the same dress that she did on THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW!) Minette seduces Pierre, as witnessed by Jacques who is watching through a window. The brothers squabble again, after all Jacques found her first. Minette goes to live with Jacques at the shanty while Pierre who suspects something is afoul stays in Thelma Lou's house. She owned her own house in Mayberry too, but maybe Pierre is helping with the payments.So Pierre and Jacques gather more moss and fight some more. Jacques throws their FISH, FUR AND MOSS sign into the swamp and dissolves their partnership as Minette has moved-in, dancing, seducing Jacques and bathing in the swamp.Minette wears the same clothes all week(s?) a momogramed M.L. blouse that arouses both Jacques' (who also wears the same black t-shirt with a slight tear above one shoulder) hormones and Pierre's suspicion. Pierre goes to Doc, not the police, and by going through some old newspapers they discover that Minette is either dead or posing as a dead woman. Pierre and Thelma Lou, not the police, decide to investigate and boat to the mainland. At a cemetery they find the real Minette's grave and her drunken, wealthy, sobbing husband who passes out. They then take the husband (Harry Lauter, once a Republic serial star) to his mansion where they learn the real story of Minette through a flashback!I'll let you take it from there, not to give away the ending or what happens next. But I will say that Minette does get back her stolen rings.Hitchcock, with a big budget and Tippi Hedren could have made this film a classic, but instead we get Lee Sholem, Nan Peterson and no budget at all. Still, I found this to be pretty decent example of a super low-budget exploitation/mystery yarn that boasted an interesting setting (you DO get to see how swamp moss is collected!) with a cast of ordinary looking people that fit right in with the locals. Everyone seemed to do a good job and even Peterson was much better than she was in SUN DEMON.SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for those who like this kind of stuff (POOR WHITE TRASH,etc.). You're certain to have a fun time on the bayou.p.s., Peter Coe who played Jacques is also known as the person who took in exploitation director Ed Wood (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, GLEN OR GLENDA)and his wife Kathy when Wood had no money and nowhere to go. Wood died at Coe's house in 1978.

Yes, I bought the TOPPS "MARS ATTACKS" trading cards when they first came out...and I still have them! So when this movie came out I ran to the theater to see it, expecting to be disappointed. Not so. I found Tim Burton's film to be both funny & scary, true to the spirit of the original cards & a great send off of 1950's sci-fi flicks. I consider MARS ATTACKS a classic of the genre. This is a great treat for sci-fi fans!...and I'm partial to Tim Burton's "ED WOOD" as well. Enjoy.

Not that I recommend forgetting JAKE BLUES, but I do think that it's about time to really give some deserved recognition to Jim Belushi as a legitimate Blues singer. This is GREAT STUFF in the Chicago Blues tradition...My packaging is of a somewhat sexier cover of a tatooed Oriental vixen boosting her ...well, I honestly believe that if you like your blues in the Buddy Guy/ Junior Wells scheme of things then this is a must-have. Keep up the good work Jim, I look forward to future projects...As for the rest of you (reading this review), get this cd before it becomes hard to find...you'll never regret it, I promise!!!

The Platinum dvd (2-disc set) featuring all 10 Hal Roach produced episodes is by all standards the ONE to get!Beautiful, crystal sharp b&w; episodes!!! No scratches, no audio hiss, no murky visuals...this is an exceptional bargain, if not the best bargain out there for lost tv episodes (the series was never released to commercial tv). Production, script and acting top-notch, totally enjoyable. Shot on film and not on video tape. Too bad those involved just couldn't get it going as the series has all the marks of being a true winner...a couple of the stories have left lingering impressions a year after viewed!!! I can't praise this set enough!!! Please buy and enjoy, especially if a fan of TWILIGHT ZONE, ONE STEP BEYOND, etc.

Pretty much a textbook example of what a great 1950s action-Western should be. Jeff Chandler steals the show as well as Kansas in one of his best ever performances (and he's had so many) as a Quantrill type ransacking Kansas towns, then reappearing with his private "army" to liberate the downtrodden offering protection, promising the Perfect Empire in exchange for support and loyalty. His methods prove to be very popular and our Napoleon of the plains is winning over the territory from the governor and his troops.One BIG mistake. Chandler's Darcy is responsible for the death of Parker's Cam Bleeker's wife while Cam was away in prison. Cam escapes and he wants vengence. Soon re-captured by the governor, he's offered a clean slate if he'll join the Jayhawkers and set Darcy up for capture.From here on it gets involved and plays out differently then might be expected...This is an important and must have release from Olive Films. It's a beautiful VistaVision print in glorious Technicolor, a sheer joy to watch and behold! Everyone involved is outstanding with an especially nice turn by Henry Silva as a demented psycho gunslinger, you know, just exactly what you would expect from him....Saw this on tv in the early 1960s in b&w; and liked it alot, so I was expecting to be disappointed, but this time the movie was actually far better than I had remembered it being. I was just a kid back then and so I only remembered the vague outline of what the film was about, as it was a film that somehow always escaped me throughout the years. So while watching this film anew I found myself in for a bonus.For 50 years now I had been haunted by a screen image. That of a little girl running out into the dusty street only to be run over, trampled in the frenzy by the bandits' countless horses. I couldn't remember the movie from which the scene had come from. I asked my Western film friends, but they didn't know. I actually thought that maybe I had imagined it, or that it was from some tv show. Then, it unfolded before my eyes and as it was happening I knew that this was it, the image reappeared, the horses came trampling down upon the little girl.Does she live or die? I won't say. I couldn't remember what her fate was, only the image.Finally, the Jerome Moross score. It's rousing, exciting, befitting of such an action-packed Western. And it's available on Amazon! Buy both the dvd and the cd, I did. One of the minor themes throughout is the WAGON TRAIN theme, subtle at first, then more noticible.This is one of my top purchases over the past year and I can't do better than to urge you to add this keeper to your dvd library. It's certainly one of my favorite Westerns from the 1950s.

Bobby and Jimmy are two eagle scouts who, through acts of bravery, win trips to South America to visit fellow scouts there. So how do they get there? Aboard Mr. Mac's little bi-plane in which they have to share a cramped cockpit seat while encountering a fierce storm and then running out of gas until they crash in the Amazon jungle. Mr. Mac has a bad foot sprain and Bobby and Jimmy set out for help. The serial follows our two heroes and their stowaway dog "Johnson" as they battle natives, bandits, wild animals and the elements while Mr. Mac contracts a fever and stumbles around aimlessly for most of the remaining chapters.This serial was lots of fun to watch especially since the main leads are two rather ordinary kids. Bobby (Bobby Cox, not the Atlanta Braves manager) is a chubby little tyke who always wants to eat but is very smart and can get out of any jam, and Jim (Jim Vance) is a tall skinny kid who is likewise with the smarts, and the two make a great team whether foiling a native sacrifice or blowing up a bandit hideout.I have both available editions of this serial and I will say that the re-mastered version is generally cleaner, however the version offered by ALPHA isn't too bad either. Both have alot of the same flaws, contrast issues most noticible. I sometimes alternated dvds for chapter comparison and forgot which one I was watching. So I would say you can purchase either and enjoy it, though I would recommend the 2-disc restored version if you don't mind spending the extra bucks.

Yes, I was hoping for some sort of in-depth tell-all... However,what I came across was a pretty good read and better than most(of this type) overview of a record company. Blue Note certainly deserves MORE...and it will come. But I must say that I did enjoy the book and that it was both entertaining and informative. The author does "intrude" with his own personal taste as to let's say Dexter Gordon's works...but heh, I agree with him on this...& I found his observations on the many other STARS: Art Blakey, Horace Silver, Lee Morgan...etc, to be pretty much ON TARGET....according to ME...but I'm no expert. I will say that reading this book has encouraged me to seek out certain composers/leaders & their works & has helped in building a jazz collection of Blue Note classics...& after all, isn't that what it's all about.....

...This is one of my favorite serials.And I agree, it may not be one of the best (or even better) serials to come out of the 1930's-40's, but it really has me hooked! Why?, I really can't explain it. Perhaps it's because I finally enjoyed seeing "poor Bela" starring as the action hero, or maybe it's even the Oriental mysticism that was so popular during this era. Or was it just the slow-moving, murky cinematic images that grace the screen. The musical score is one of the best ever for a serial, almost grand in conception, evoking the allure of Oriental mysticism while providing both tension and excitement.The VCI release is the best out there. A couple of early chapters look a little shoddy, most likely due to source material, grainy, with lines, etc. But, overall, the print is quite clear and rather impressive with sharp contrast and good audio. It's probably never going to get any better than this any time soon. This IS THE dvd to buy if you want to see Chandu battle the infamous Ubasto Cult and ultimately save Princess Nadji from certain "sacrificial" death.As mentioned above, this is one of my favorite serials. I love the slow pacing. It enhances the mood and plot development. The serial moves along more like a feature film than a cliffhanger. And Bela is just in SUPER BELA mode, a series should have been born from out of this!Orientalism! Mysticism! And a primer for INDIANA JONES!This is must-see pulp fiction at it's best. I'm surprised they didn't hand this one to Fritz Lanz...only dreaming there.

Interesting entry to gothic/Euro/vampire series of the 1960's, this b&w; little gem has alot going for it such as odd characters: mute menace, weird village doctor, amiable/alcoholic tavern keeper, black man-servent of great strength; a breezy jazz soundtrack; some outstanding set design (caveren/tombs) and nice camera work.It seems there has been a number of deaths (6 young women in the last 6 months) in this tiny village in the middle of Yugoslavia and Inspector Doren (Adrian Hoven...catch him in the Jess Franco RED LIPS films!!!) is sent to get to the bottom of things. He ends up battling vampires of course! When the young tavern maid is killed we see shadows of Nosferatu all along the walls. You've just got to love it! You have gothic castles, scantly clad Euro-babes, a gypsy witch-woman, Wolfgang Preiss (Dr. Mabuse himself!) as a bizzare scientist living high a-top the village in rotting splendor, and those wonderful on location Yugoslavian village shots which are probably exactly the same today, white-washed simple structures 100+ yrs. old! You can smell the decay of vampires! You can see everyone's breath in the cold dampness! Lots of candle-light and crackling fires!This is certainly an underated little treasure of a vampire film and I would urge any lover of such horrors to snatch up a copy before this one goes out of print. Great (AND FUN!) stuff.

This is one Franco film that has everything going for it. Excellent (CRISP/CLEAR) b&w; photography gives a chilling low-key gothic feel to the going's-on, a bizzare mixture of artsy murders and kinky nightclub routines. Dr.Z (Strangelove?) hangs around for only a few minutes and then it's his daughter that revenges his death by brainwashing an exotic dancer to dispatch those who ridiculed Dr.Z. With poisoned tipped finger nails, bodies thrown from trains, slammed through windows, etc...you will most likely enjoy this eurotrash classic. Franco regular Howard Vernon has a small role and Franco appears as a police inspector.Great stuff. Enjoy.

Joel McCrea could do this stuff in his sleep but always manages to bring a sense of conviction and sincerity to his Western characterizations. McCrea's judge Thorne is a mature, level-headed man up against impossible odds yet goes about his job as though it were daily routine. One could see why McCrea wanted Jacques Tourneur to direct as his character is similar to the one he played in Tourneur's STARS IN MY CROWN, a man of deep convictions who straps on his guns only when there is no other way.Surprisingly, this film actually has the feel of an early Spaghetti Western, in that our hero faces several situations in which he is vastly out-numbered (as in DJANGO) yet easily deals with the situation. The photography and locales (Sedona) greatly enhance the experience. As for odd touches, I personally like the wide-angle shot in the marshal's office with the cat just off to the right cleaning itself while important dialogue is being discussed...you're focused on the cat until you realise that you'd better pay attention here.It seems that Tom Bannerman (well played by Kevin McCarthy) has shot and killed an innocent man who objected to Tom molesting his wife. The Bannermans run the whole valley (much like the Barkleys, only they're not as nice) and Josiah Bannerman (another great John McIntire performance) doesn't want his only son standing trial for murder and he sets his minions against McCrea's Thorne, a man committed to uphold the law and bring Tom to trial at all costs. This plays like RIO BRAVO before RIO BRAVO, with touches of GUNMAN'S WALK and Burt Lancaster's later (1970's) LAWMAN thrown in.Emile Meyer also gives an excellent performance as the Town Marshal who sides with McCrea. It's a nicely played low-keyed role of a complex character on the fringe of things. And Miroslava just overflows with sexuality in a striking (OUCH!) performance. I had never heard of her and sadly the extras on the dvd tell of her committing suicide shortly after making this film.I won't give it away, but the final confrontation is no less than outstanding. A superior Western all around, a classic example of quality 1950's Western fare, a keeper to your dvd library. The color process was a cheap Technicolor substitute (Anscocolor) but the restoration has brought us a vivid, quality presentation with many scenes looking just fantastic. It's mostly the night scenes that don't fare as well, the fault of the Ansco process, not the restoration. So for those of you who are going to nit-pick about Technicolor imperfections, just be glad that this rarely seen (almost lost forever) and important McCrea Western is now available for us to enjoy. And it's a good one, one of Joel's best, maybe a belt notch below FOUR FACES WEST and RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, but that alone is praise enough.

BLACK RAVEN IS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF A POVERTY ROW OLD DARK HOUSE MURDER MYSTERY. STORMY NIGHT, WASHED-OUT BRIDGE, WEIRD ASSORTMENT OF ODDBALL CHARACTERS WITH SHADY PASTS, SPOOKY WAYSIDE INN, SECRETS TO HIDE, AND THEN THE MURDERS BEGIN...EVERYONE IS A POTENTIAL SUSPECT OR VICTIM.GEORGE ZUCCO IS A MASTER AT THIS KIND OF STUFF & IS GREAT TO WATCH AS ALWAYS, SECOND ONLY TO LUGOSI FOR SHEER ENTERTAINMENT VALUE IN THE LAND OF PRC/MONOGRAM. A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF THE GENRE!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.HOWEVER,....THE ALPHA DVD VERSION COMES FROM NOT THE GREATEST SOURCE MATERIAL. THE PRINT IS RATHER DARK MAKING IT HARD TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON IN SOME SCENES & THAT'S WHY I KNOCK OFF A STAR IN THE OVERALL RATING OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A MUST FOR ZUCCO FANS.

This is a complete uncut version of a great Roy Rogers film, in which all of the REPUBLIC FILMS cowboy stars join Roy to help Dale and Gabby save Dale's ranch for orphaned boys. They're all here: Sunset Carson, Wild Bill Elliot, Alan Rocky Lane, Bob Livingston, and Don Red Barry. And the songs are all here too! Lots of footage had been cut to fill tv time slots in the 1950's, and the first stuff to go was always the songs in order to keep the plot as intact as possible.However...although the good news is that this is possibly the best version available, it's still in need of some serious restoration. The print, while free of awful splice cuts, is dark and murky and could use a good digital cleaning. The night scenes are so bad you can hardly make out who the characters are. Some scenes appear to shift from washed out to somewhat clearer. The audio could be spruced up too.But still, if you want an uncut print with all of the songs intact, then I can still recommend the purchase of this dvd from ALPHA. I just hope that some company out there (ROAN? They've put out excellent Roy Rogers restorations in the past) can clean this film up and release it properly. After all, this was one of REPUBLIC's premier features, and one that all fans of Roy, Gabby and Dale would love to add to their collections.P.S.....Just to see what I was missing I pulled out my Platinum/Echo Bridge ROY ROGERS VOL.1 which has 5 movies on one single sided disc. BELLS OF ROSARITA is listed here as the 54 min. cut for tv version. Boy was I surprised!!! It's the complete 68 min. version and unlike ALPHA's dark and murky copy this one is super clear, sharp image with great background depth!!! This is the one to get, PERIOD!!!However, on the same dvd, HANDS ACROSS THE BORDER is listed at it's full running time of 72 min. and is a badly cut 52 min. version. Go figure.

BEAUTIFUL prints of this B-Western series that used and re-used locations, stock footage and actors and actresses over and over again into one bundle of very good-looking dvd releases! Amazing for what it is, no sense at all in trying to relate plot lines and such as most of the fun here comes in spotting character changes and oft used location sites. However, this does not mean that the series is poor, unwatchable, or a forgettable laugh-fest. Quite on the contrary, this is a HIGHLY enjoyable series, very well-made on a next to nothing budget. I know of nothing else like it! All involved are to be commended!......and it's really great seeing baddies Tom Tyler, Dennis Moore, etc., being killed over and over, again and again, movie after movie, with hardly a change in clothes!!!A GREAT example of such stuff, probably the best to date. Super, super low budget film making at it's finest! For B-Western fans, 5 STARS as a rating can't do this release justice...You need this collection.

Many thanks to V.C.I. Entertainment for releasing a super quality restoration of a serial that I've owned on several inferior video tapes, including V.C.I.'s own 2-tape set. Prints were splicy/jumpy, the image not too clear and the sound horrible.All that has changed!!! This is a swell looking version and the audio is much improved even for my deaf ears, though some minor audio distortation is still present but does not distract to the overall enjoyment one bit. It's just that some things can't be fully fixed and I can live with that.Harry Carey is fantastic as Hawkeye, solid, stalwart guardian of the New York frontier as he attempts to retreive stolen dispatches meant for the British at Fort William Henry. The French and their Indian allies, the Hurons, continuously re-capture Col. Monroe's daughters on their way to the fort. Hawkeye, the Sagamore (Hobart Bosworth) and Uncas (Frank "Junior" Coughlan), the Last of the Mohicans intervene. Lots of great outdoor scenic shots make this eastern Western something special. We get a real feel for the French and Indian (1750's) War with lots of neat period uniforms and frontier costumes. Carey even tosses in some bits of period dialogue with a few "yon" and "yonders".This is a fun serial, of course loosely based on James Fenimore Cooper's famous novel, and is a real treat for all fans, one not to be missed, a keeper for the collection.And I would be amiss not to add that this serial presents Bob Kortman's best ever role as renegade Huron Maugua, and he certainly makes the most of it. A performance worthy of inclusion in something more like John Ford's DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK!!!Again, thanks galore to V.C.I. for restoring one of my favorite serials, a job well done.

You get 321 action-packed pages here! And I do mean "packed"!There are 754 actual entries here, so the print is small, but quite readible on good quality paper stock. And there's nothing wrong with my binding as this book has been getting frequent use on a daily basis for several months now.Author Rainey gives us a complete alphabetical listing of all known silent and sound serials made throughout the world circa 1912-1956. Most (85%,guess) were made in the USA. Series are also included. Not series like the B-Western Range Busters, but those (usually silent) which were serial-like in format and ran mostly 2 reels with continuing characters and/or plotlines, but with no cliffhangers at the end of each episode.This is the perfect reference book, period. While most serial books concentrate on a selection of serials with the author commenting on his choices, Rainey's listing is complete with all production notes; year, producer, director, cast, chapter listings, plot summary,etc., etc. Weiss' book TO BE CONTINUED (1972) attempted the same but was far too sketchy and incomplete on several entries.So for action fans of the old time movie serials I can't recommend this book enough. It's about as complete a book of this type as you'll ever see, and it's also loaded with hundreds of rare photos of lobby cards and serial scenes, all of which are nicely reproduced, most of which I haven't seen before.A definate armchair companion. Buy, enjoy.

This is most likely the best Roy Rogers dvd on the market today. 3 restored movies from ROAN GROUP ARCHIVAL ENTERTAINMENT ( on one disc ) and they're all winners!DAYS OF JESSE JAMES (1939) directed by Joe Kane has Roy & Gabby siding with Jesse played by Don "Red" Barry.ROLL ON TEXAS MOON (1946) directed by William Whitney is one of my personal favorites as Roy tries to clear up a scrap between the sheepmen and cattlemen. I like when Gabby ( a cattleman ) is always being followed by Dale's pet lamb. He yells, " ...quit follerin' me ya walkin' lamb chop! "...This is the uncut theatrical version.KING OF THE COWBOYS (1943) also directed by Joe Kane is the big WINNER here. Combining several source prints this version runs longer than it's original theatrical version & also includes alternate scenes as a bonus.All 3 films LOOK GREAT & it's a real treat to watch them presented as such.Another great bonus is a Trucolor short of Roy welcoming Roy Rogers Riders Club members to this weeks movie at the local theater.All in all this dvd is A MUST for all Roy Rogers Fans!!!As Gabby would say," That's the ticket by crackie!".BUY THIS.

Anticipating the Giallo and the Bondian/AVENGERS spy style with hooded killers, jazzy bombastic scores, decapitative heads (female), flashing blades, whacked-out sex killers and super criminal masterminds the German Krimi films of the early 1960s must have certainly seemed fresh and exciting, yet as familiar as a visit to Fritz Lang's original silent masterpiece, DR. MABUSE, THE GAMBLER.My favorite scene in FELLOWSHIP OF THE FROG (1959) is when master criminal, the Frog, flips out at the whining babe he has strapped to a chair, and instead of torturing her with a red hot poker opts for grabbing a machine gun and emptying it into her helpless body, steadily firing long after her limp form, still strapped to the chair, has hit the floor, ranting on about his criminal superiority. It's just so sudden and over the top! And this was 1959!...And this is in no way a spoiler to enjoying this weird b&w; stylistic thriller as the scene holds no key to giving away the plot development.The better film, though not by much, and only in my humble opinion, is THE MAD EXECUTIONERS (1963), about a Scotland Yard investigator trying to unravel the mystery behind a secret hooded organization that captures, tries and executes criminals who are beyond the reach of the law for crimes against society. It's one of the better, if not the best, in the entire series of around 30+ films roughly covering 1959-1969. This one is presented in wide-screen and has a very "modernist" look to it with a sex killer who lives in an artistic (morbid paintings, modern sculpture) bachalor pad, complete with basement lab for easy decapitation.These two films teamed together are a pretty good example of what is going on in the Krimi genre, one early and one in the Edgar Wallace series prime, though Edgar's son, Bryan Edgar Wallace is responsible for THE MAD EXECUTIONERS. And the prints are in pretty good shape as well, and though scratches appear on both films, the images are for the most part sharp and very watchable.Very entertaining stuff that really needs to be seen and appreciated by a wider audiance.Give it a try.

John Payne's Eddie Rice (aka Riccardi) got some shrapnel embedded into his head during WW2 and now he can't remember anything about his past or who he even is. All that he knows is that he's from L.A., and that turns out to be far more than he bargained for. As soon as he arrives in town he's pegged by the cops. It seems that his pre-war years were somewhat shady. Payne is befuddled and determined to sort things out, and it all soon spirals downward in true fatalistic Noir fashion.Thanks to John Alton's camera and Robert Florey's assured direction THE CROOKED WAY is a textbook example of the Noir look/style. Scene after scene, image after image. Great on location shots of L.A., day and night, a true historical time capsule. Lots of shadows and neon. And it's really a pretty good film as well as Eddie Rice finds his true self and even his wife! Top-notch directing and acting by great cast...and the dvd by GENEON is excellent for a low budget label, with a beautiful, crisp transfer. A super buy for all Noir fans. 5-STARS.

Lots of Spaghetti Western action for not much investment. Do the math, 3 dvds at around 10 bucks = 9 movies, so a dollar or so per movie or $3.33 per disc. And yes, these are public domain releases, so quality & content varies per movie. However, the deciding factor here is that all 3 discs are SINGLE SIDED!!! No scratched up flippers!And there's lots of enjoyable Spaghetti action here. DEATH RIDES A HORSE is the most widly known offering, but ANY GUN CAN PLAY, Corbucci's THE HELLBENDERS and MINNESOTA CLAY and THE GRAND DUEL and THIS MAN CAN'T DIE are some of my favorites. Recommended especially for those who want a taste of Spaghetti...you get alot of bang for your buck!Single sided discs with 9 Spaghetti Westerns. A super value. Take the plunge, after all you can only watch John Wayne's THE WAR WAGON (a great Western!) so many times without wondering what's being done over in Italy and Spain at around the same time. This set is probably the best sampler out there. Quality-wise, hit or miss, but the value here more than compensates for any shortcomings... and again, these are single sided discs. Go for it.

Tim goes undercover (as usual) to get the goods on a counterfeit ring who has kidnapped an engraver to produce phoney bills. In fact, Tim McCoy seems to go undercover to trap the bad guys more than any other B-Western star. This time, as Tim Hayes he pretends he's an outlaw and robs a couple gang members of their bogus cash which he starts spreading around. There's a great cantina scene in which Tim grooves to the dancing of heroine Suzanne Kaaren who's also undercover trying to rescue her dad, the kidnapped engraver. Tim gyrating to the rather dull dance routine is a real hoot! Karl Hackett is great as usual as the gang leader, a position he's played countless times with slimy ease. John Merton and good ol' Charlie King are the top gang members and usual badguy Tom London is a peace officer this time around.This is sure-fire entertainment on a decent looking disc from ALPHA DVD!The image is pretty sharp and the sound is excellent. Highly recommended!

"MR. JIM", another reviewer, indicates that these films are fully restored with digital dolby sound. Please do not purchase these films for that reason because it's not true. "MR. JIM" must front for V.C.I. ENTERTAINMENT because every Western or serial dvd that company releases has a 5 star rating for it posted by "MR. JIM", insisting that the V.C.I. product is also fully restored with digital dolby sound. "MR. JIM" it seems has never seen a bad B-Western or serial that hasn't been fully restored with digital dolby sound no matter what company puts it out! We should all be so lucky!!!Now I buy a lot of the V.C.I. product and they put out quality material, though it would be unfair to say that all of their releases have been given the full restoration treatment. So how can we accept "MR, JIM" 's evaluation of quality if he feels the same even about the ALPHA dvd product which is no more than whatever print they can find slapped onto a dvd, some excellent, many good, a lot very poor, none fully restored to any degree. His reviews have lead customers into buying something other than what they thought they were getting.This particular Tim McCoy double bill is only so-so quality wise but still a good buy for fans of public domain B-Westerns. Both films star Tim as F.B.I. undercover agent Lightning Bill Carson. Bennie Corbett is his assistant/helper Magpie in both films, who, despite the corny name, is a pretty competent assistant. Both films were produced by the same company (VICTORY), and made by the same director (Sam Newfield) in 1939. Lots of the same cast members and locations were used for both films. Budget film making at it's best!STRAIGHT SHOOTER is the worst of the two. Quality wise it's a much worn print, dark and fuzzy. The story involving missing bonds that were stolen then hidden on the deceased outlaw's ranch offers little thrills and too much talking and plotting. Ted Adams is fine as usual as the badguy and Julie Sheldon is spunky enough as the dead man's niece but it takes forever for things to get going and when they do nothing much happens.The second film, TRIGGER FINGERS, is the real winner here and makes the dvd worth purchasing. A much nicer print, clear image with good sound.Ted Adams is back again as a badguy but this time he has quality help from Carleton Young as the crooked sheriff and Ken Duncan as a cronie. Cattle rustling is the gimmick this time and Lightning Bill, Magpie and Bill's female assistant Maggie (lovely Joyce Bryant) all disguise themselves as gypsies in order to get the goods on the baddies which they somehow manage to do in one short afternoon. I just love it when Tim McCoy puts on a disguise and goes over the top in character! His Mexicans and gypsies are his best disguises and this performance rivals all others!And to boot, Magpie and Maggie are gypsies too. Great stuff!The Walker and Jauregui movie ranches were used in both films as ranch houses and hideouts. They can still be visited today and are part of the Placerita Canyon State Park about 25-30 miles north of Los Angeles. Lord knows, Tim McCoy, cast and crew certainly visited them enough times!

Mascot made such wonderful serials; surreal, dream-like, yet having an almost documentary feel to them, as though you're right there, mixed into the bizarre goings-on. When the mysterious VOICE is unmasked in the final chapter it just can't be that person because he was present several times in the presence of others when the voice would broadcast over shortwave!!! An error in plotting? Nah, it's just Mascot being Mascot and such things are of no matter in the Mascot universe of things.Harry Carey plays Happy Cardigan, oil rigger trying to bring in a well and battling both The Voice and The Vanishing Legion at the same time while helping Jimmy Williams clear his father Jed Williams of a murder charge. Edward Hearn plays Jed, sexy Garbo-ish Edwina Booth is heroine Caroline Hall, the best child actor of the time Frankie Darro is young Jimmy, former silent Western star William Desmond is the sheriff, and Rex, King of the Wild Horses is, of course Rex. The usual posse rounds out the cast of henchmen and others: Bob Kortman as The Voice's right hand man, Joe Bonomo, Yak Canutt, Dick Dickinson as The Vanishing Legion. Old timer Lafe McKee plays Hornbeck, an attorney and Olive Fuller Golden (Harry Carey's wife) plays Miss Lewis a suspicious nurse.The Alpha dvd is watchable, dark in spots, soft and fuzzy in others, poor sound in general, quality varying from chapter to chapter. Serial Squadron (you have to go to their web site to order) put out an excellent re-mastered version, the picture image being generally clear and sharp. The audio is also light years better than Alpha's however sprocket noise is unavoidable. My problem with Serial Squadron is that their menu is difficult to access and their discs don't always read. I had to keep trying to get things going. Also the image froze a couple times but then played fine when I reversed play then went forward again.All in all I'd recommend buying the Serial Squadron version. The problems were minor and the difference in quality is astounding!A previous reviewer listed some VANISHING LEGION trivia...I'd like to add some more:1)According to his wife Olive Carey, Harry Carey could not drive a car and never did learn. All his driving scenes were faked. She used to drive him to work every day, hence her casting in VANISHING LEGION.2)Edward Hearn who plays Frankie Darro's father Jed, the accused murderer on the run, was a known homosexual. His constant hugging and kissing of young Darro must have raised some eyebrows at the time.3)Silent Western star William Desmond wore the same clothes as he did in his two silent classics THE RIDDLE RIDER (Universal 1924) and THE RETURN OF THE RIDDLE RIDER (Universal 1927). Desmond also starred in THE VANISHING RIDER (Universal 1928).4)When Voice henchman Bob Kortman (he's the real ugly guy) is seen in a pin stripe suit Olive Carey tells the story, "...Bob Kortman needed a buiness suit. He'd forgotten to bring one with him. The scene had to be shot. Nat (Levine, the producer) jumped into a rain barrel, took off his own pin stripe, and gave it to Kortman."All the above info is in Jon Tuska's wonderful book on Mascot Pictures, THE VANISHING LEGION!If you like this serial you may want to try Mascot's THE PHANTOM OF THE WEST (1930) starring Tom Tyler. The Alpha dvd of this one is EXCELLENT! And it also has mystery riders in it!...the Voice has spoken!

I almost did not buy this movie because some of the reviewers ranted about the improper aspect ratio resulting in missing heads and badly framed compositions...Sorry, but I thought the image looked great, better than to be expected for a 50 year old Italian vampire movie of such a low budget. The b&w; photography was crisp and clear and the estate and sets appeared wonderfully gothic and romantic. Walter Brandi could have been playing Lord Byron having one hell of a tragic nightmare!I won't go into story detail as I never really like to tell too much to anyone who may want to watch this film; only to reassure you that the DARK SKY print is exceptional and the overall viewing experience was enjoyable. Dieter Eppler made the most of his vampire presence, and Graziella Granata is one of the most beautiful, sexually alluring women to ever appear in a vampire film. Aldo Piga's score was very effective, haunting and romantic and hopefully will one day be available on cd.I also purchased the RETROMEDIA version as well. I figured that since I wasn't going to purchase either, I'd just go ahead with it and get both for comparison. The RETROMEDIA version is just awful compared to DARK SKY's. It looks like something ALPHA VIDEO would have put out for around 5 bucks. So if you're considering purchasing a copy of this film then please, go with the DARK SKY dvd. It's a great buy for this enjoyable vampire film.

This is for the APLHA DVD version.Very good looking print of what is considered one of the cult classics of B-Westerns, mixing elements of sci-fi, horror and shoot'em ups. This starts off like a Tailspin Tommy aviation movie with hero Tim McCoy (G-Man) flying over an area where aircraft have been reported missing, going down and crashing. He's to find out first-hand why? Sure enough Tim's plane gets the fits and Tim has to parachute to safety. It's because cowboy outlaws have kidnapped a scientist and are using his invention to carry out their evil scheme by bringing down aircraft transporting valuable bonds. We get lots of lab stuff here with crackling strobes of electric lights all buzzing and hissing in the true Frankenstein manner.Time passes, but not too much. One of the outlaws (3 STOOGES foil Dick Curtis) goes into the big city to deal some bonds, gets shot and winds up in the hospital. The gang thinks he's dead. His assassin is caught by the G-Men, the bonds recovered and Tim McCoy then takes the assassin's place and tries to infiltrate the gang. During this period of the movie and henceforth Tim discards his aviation gear and dons his cowboy outfit as he picks up the kidnapped scientist's daughter (he's driving an 1880's buckboard and she's hitch-hiking) on his way to the ghost town. There's lots of neat interplay between the two as they ride along trying to check each other out. Tim's sidekick (he's hidden in the back of the buckboard) tries to show our hero a newspaper clipping about the missing scientist he's found amongst the heroine's luggage.We arrive at the ghost town. Tim upstages the gang. Lots of secret panels and shifty goings-on. Wheeler Oakman is great, as usual, as the gang leader and the always outstanding Walter Miller is the big boss. Claudia Dell is fiesty and pretty. Things seem to be going Tim's way...until bad guy Dick Curtis is released from the hospital and shows up at the ghost town.This is just great stuff! We get aviation thrills, a mad scientist lab in flashing splendor, a ghost town, cowboys and outlaws, an insane plot involving stolen bonds, and all played straight! If you're a fan of Autry's serial THE PHANTOM EMPIRE then this will be familiar territory. One word to describe it all: Whacky!And pay no attention to ALPHA's dvd cover illustration. Tim DOES wear his famous BIG white cowboy hat in this film, not the little brown one on the dvd. It may not mean much to some, but it means a lot to me, as I always identify Tim with that BIG WHITE 50-GALLON HAT!!!One of Tim McCoy's best B-Westerns. One of the best B-Westerns, period. A super nice print from ALPHA dvd...Go for it.

The above line is actually uttered by James Coburn in Sam Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID, however it seems more than appropriate in describing this Audie Murphy oater. Made at the same time as Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, APACHE RIFLES is definately a throwback to 1950's American Westerns, not that that's a bad thing, it's just that times have definately changed, perhaps not for the overall good, but changed they did. And this "old" style of Hollywood Western is about to morph into something far more cynical, with less emphasis on moral values and entering houses justified. The anti-hero has just been given birth and the true "hero" as savior has just been shattered. THE EXORCIST is only a few years away.Had APACHE RIFLES been made in the 1950's it would have been given a decent budget and high profile director, and most likely would have been an important entry into the genre. This is by no means a criticism toward director William Whitney, who in my opinion was one of the best directors of the 1930's-40's. It's just that he's associated with low budget serial fare even though he could direct circles around the high profilers.The plot is pretty straight-forward. The Apache have left the reservation because greedy miners led by L.Q. Jones (in one of his great as always roles) have encroached upon their given lands, killing Indians to line their pockets with gold. Nothing new here, but with a bigger budget it could have been. Audie, however, is spot-on as Jeff Preston, cavalry officer given command of the situation. He's hard as nails, a known Indian hater, yet he commands the respect of his troops. He sees the error of his ways and comes over to the Indian's point of view. It's a complex character that Audie handles skillfully. Unfortunately, Audie always seemed to get better, more assured of himself as an actor, honing in his acting skills to perfection as the budgets and market for his product lessened. Audie Murphy became a great actor when there was nothing left for him to act in. Very sad.As for the dvd itself, my God, buy it.Nice clear transfer. Another outstanding job from VCI. I could actually imagine myself in the the theater watching this.YOU NEED THIS MOVIE if you are a serious fan of Western films. It's TRULY one of the last of it's kind, a dying breed. Times ARE changing and this type of Western film was soon to be no more. No more heroes, only cold blooded killers pretending to be heroes. This is one of the last true Westerns.

PHANTOM RANCHER (1940) is from Ken Maynard's wide-waist era and is one of his last starring films in a Western series. Produced by ultra low-budget Colony Films the cheapness really shows. Bad film stock, bad stock footage inserts, bad scripting, acting and direction...just downright bad all-around!However, Ken still has that appealing charm, that winning persona, that likable character presence that can shine above any amount of badness to be dished out. And Tarzan is always a big help as well!In this one Ken must disguise himself as the Phantom Rancher in order to secure money to be payed back to himself to prevent the foreclosure of rancher's loans. It seems all the ranchers think Ken is the one out to get them when in reality it's really ace bad-guy Ted Adams (in a suit this time) behind all the murderous scheming.Usual heavy Tom London is the lawman and usual good guy Dave O'Brien is the top hench/ heavy. Once again O'Brien (DEVIL BAT, CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT, etc.) shines in a poverty row production! He could have been a leading man in A-productions...their loss, our gain.This is certainly a good, slam-bang B-Western with likeable Ken Maynard in a Lone Ranger type role, some great baddies and some awful production values...still, fun can be had here.Pop open a beer (...err, carton of milk), pour out a bowl of nacho chips, sit back and enjoy the mysterious PHANTOM RANCHER riding at night to right all wrongs and save the valley from...himself!Enjoy.

Likeable Western star Tom Tyler stars in this ultra low budget(Reliable Studios)oater as a cowpoke returning home only to find himself caught in the middle of a family fued. His family is on one side of the river (which we never see)and the family of the girl he loves is on the other side. It turns out that some ranch hands hired by Tom's father are really behind the cattle rustling and murders, but Tom sorts it all out in 55 minutes and gets to marry the girl(Geraldine Greer aka Joan Barclay) reuniting the two families.This film is certainly a passable way to kill an hour, but you've seen it all before, and done much better. The first 45 minutes are spent riding around dusty roads, up and down various hills and in and out of sagebrush. Several potshots are taken at Tom and gunfire is exchanged from behind the few rocks available. Continuity is nonexistent.The big climax in the last 10 minutes moves onto a town set where everyone scrambles about and sometimes we're not really sure who just shot who, but Tom rides for help and the good guys win.The Alpha dvd is choppy, but not too bad, and has audio hissing and sprocket noise at places...but let's face it, it hardly seems likely that this little B-Western will ever be restored and so we must be thankful for Alpha actually making it available for viewing in the first place.Recommended for fans of Tom Tyler and really cheap cowboy movies. Others may be disappointed.

Enjoyable mid-1930's Bob Steele B-Western has our hero posing as an escaped convict to get the goods on an outlaw gang and their hidden loot. Directed in fine form by Steele's father, and often director, Robert N. Bradbury, this is the movie with the famous chase scene in which Bob beats the badguys back to the hideout by jumping off his horse, grabbing a nearby stick, and riding this stick down a mud sluice!!! Fantastic!!!Also of note: I just went on a binge watching a half dozen or so B-Westerns from the mid-30's featuring Ken Maynard, Tex Ritter and several others as well as Steele and noticed that badguy Charlie King was in ALL of them, getting pummelled and killed over and over again and again!!! He would just get up and come right back for more of the same. Movie after movie. Just like Wile E. Coyote in a Roadrunner cartoon!!! And for a heavyset man he could really throw a punch and take a pounding. It's amazing how this guy got around so often. He had to have been making three movies at the same time!!!

Perhaps this should have been scored by J. Strauss; THE BAT, Roland West's silent film from 1926, is a very good old spooky house thriller from the past. The Menzies set designs are astounding! The ALPHA print is extremely clear and very watchable! You don't have to be a fan of silent movies to enjoy this one, it moves along at at quick pace and all actors are interesting enough to keep any viewer interested. This is the Mother of all SPOOKY HOUSE thrillers so popular in the 1930-40's. This is also the source inspiration of Bob Kane for his BATMAN strip!A hidden bank robbery fortune with a mysterious bat-like killer under one roof with all the usual suspects. Way ahead of it's time, yet still an old chestnut when it was made!Buy the ALPHA version. It's cheap, it looks very good, and if you're worried that you can't set through a silent movie but want to give one a try, then worry no more, this is THE ONE!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

An alphabetical listing of all known Silent Western films. Thousands listed, with cast, crew, etc. Great to match up early films with later sound era productions of B-Western stars Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Bob Steele, Tom Tyler; and B-Characters Charlie King, Tom London, George Chesboro, Ben Corbett, Wally Wales, etc.Invaluable information, a must for all serious Western film fans/ historians. A much-needed addition to any serious Western film library, and just a really fun reference guide for all the rest of us.Buy this, you need it.

You've seen it all before and often better as cowboy star Ken Maynard as Ken Clark pretending to be Frank Gordon saves Kay Burke's ( Eleanor Stewart ) ranch from being taken over by the bad-guys. Tom London plays a crooked horse buyer and gets into a pretty good knockabout fistfight with Ken at the climax and more than holds his own considering his advanced age! John Merton plays a nightclub owner in Chicago during the film's opening sequence and also gets into a fight with Ken but doesn't fare as well as old Tom. Dave O'Brien plays drunken Frank Gordon in both Chicago and out west. He doesn't have a sober line and O'Brien while quite amiable as a cowboy hero and/or team member ( Texas Rangers series ) is really embarassing when he gets carried away playing a drunk or a drug addict as in REEFER MADNESS.This film was made in 1939 during Maynard's last go-round as a cowboy star. He's put on considerable weight ( poor Tarzan ! ) and comes off more like a likable oaf rather than his unassuming shy hero type. The film is also padded with stock footage of cowboys falling from horses during the gunfight scenes. It's grainy and doesn't really match the action.The overall ALPHA print is ok. Not the greatest, but not bad either, a pretty good buy for the money. The ALPHA product is hit or miss on quality, but they do offer a vast selection of B-Westerns and other hard to find public domain gems that major companies stay away from releasing. Their price is right and their packaging always attractive! I used to pay ( 20-25 yrs.ago ) 10 to 15 bucks for B-Westerns on video tape from private sources that weren't any better quality-wise and happy to get them! You probably did too...So, with times so bad in today's economy you can still see a passel of ALPHA cowboy movies pretty cheap. It's like going back to the movies in the 1930's when we had that other Depression.

Robert Clarke has got to be the forgotten star of 50's sci-fi classics! John Agar and Richard Denning are the big two, and even Peter Graves is quite noticible. But Robert (MAN FROM PLANET X, ASTOUNDING SHE MONSTER, BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER) Clarke seems to go unnoticed as a major star of the genre.THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON should have propelled Clarke right to the top! It's certainly his CITIZEN KANE as he produced, directed and starred in this prime example of low budget b&w; 50's sci-fi drive-in fare.And a classic it is! Clarke plays Gil the stumble drunk atomic scientist who drops his radioactive isotope and becomes exposed to it's effects, which now means that whenever Gil steps out into the sunlight he becomes Gil-man the reptilian monster who likes to crush rats and kill dogs and make love to a big chested blonde who sings in a dubbed voice and plays a wicked piano!Lots of cool noirish night scenes, cigarette smoke, sleazey bars and a fierce beating. Lots of blazing sun, sweaty rubber suited monster scenes and a tragic ending for Gil.The Image dvd has a few scratches, some speckling, but is quite clear, some shots looking as though they could have been filmed yesterday...and all those 50's cars and street scenes!Again, a great example of this kind of stuff! Some funny moments, but mostly pretty effective. A great looking dvd and a good buy.And if you're like me, you've probably watched or will watch THE HIDEOUS SUN DEMON far more times than CITIZEN KANE.

...At least according to me, and if you're wondering if it's possible for The Range Busters to actually have a "BEST" film, then this is most definately the one I would nominate. The dialogue is quite good, playing up the Western genre with stylized, snappy one-liners, sort of reminding me of Spaghetti Westerns, only 20+ years ahead of it's time, especially in the early scenes that have Crash Corrigan meeting with and exchanging machisimo shooting skills with I. Stanford Jolly, who, himself, looks as though he just rode in off a Cinecitta sound stage.The film itself is usual Range Busters fare, rounding up the bad guys while Crash and Dusty compete for the fair maid. Yet this one rises above the usual with good performances from George Chesebro, who starts off as kind of a good guy for once, which threw me off track briefly, but reverts back into his comfortable self becoming the chief foil for puppet Elmer Sneezeweed's barbed banter. And this is one of the episodes where Elmer, left on his own, actually moves by himself as though alive,...kindda creepy.And speaking of creepy, Glenn Strange reprises his Monsterous Halfwit Idiot character from PRC's George Zucco horror film of the same year, THE MAD MONSTER. John Merton and Steve Clark also appear doing what they do best, boss heavy and elderly sheriff respectively. Jean Brooks has little to do as the female lead, but does it well enough.The ALPHA DVD source print I found quite acceptible, clear with good audio, especially for my deaf ears. So many Range Busters dvds are so dark and choppy with bad audio, but not this one. I actually enjoyed the scenery of Crash Corrigan's ranch for once! So rest assured, this is a good one to pick up if you're a fan of such stuff. I really liked it a lot and consider it to be my favorite Range Busters movie...maybe.

Saying that UNDER TEXAS SKIES (1930) is a weird Western is indeed an understatement.Cowboy Star Bill Cody, on his way to buy cavalry mounts for the government from Natalie Kingston, is captured by the badguys and thrown into a shack guarded by a mute brute called "DUMMY". Tom London takes his place as Captain Hartford in an effort to swindle Kingston out of the horses. Cowboy Star Bob Custer shows up as Rankin a suspicious character suspicious of London's ploy. Kingston suspects Custer and signs with London. Cowboy Star Lane Chandler shows up 30 minutes into the plot looking for Cody who has by now been tossed around several times by hulking DUMMY. There's also something about twin pinto horses and we're never really sure who knows who or what exactly is going on. Done on a fifty dollar budget there's lots of neat "camera in your face" shots especially of slobbering DUMMY dragging around Bill Cody. It all doesn't make much sense but I'm not sure if it's because the movie is under or over plotted. It all looks like a home movie of sorts but is rather fascinating to watch. Some shots are out of focus, some are visually stunning. Tom London gives the best performance here with lots of dialog. Bob Custer stands around looking about as confused as I was watching this. Natalie Kingston (TARZAN THE TIGER, silent serial)appears as ditzy as Lane Chandler appears confident, in his sharp suit singing to himself as he ties up gang members. And Bill Cody spends most of his screen time being knocked out or dragged around by DUMMY, played by one Bill Roper who appears to be playing himself. I heavily recommend this strangeness to all takers. It's directed by prolific B-Western actor/director J.P. McGowan......as was the second Bob Custer feature on this ALPHA dvd, RIDERS OF THE NORTH (1931), made a year later with none of the weirdness that oozed from UNDER TEXAS SKIES. This rather routine tale has Mountie Sergeant Stone (Custer) after the killers of a fellow mountie. His girlfriend's brother thinks he's the killer but it's really the evil French Canadian trapper LeClerc. Enjoyable but uneventful. And the print for Riders OF THE NORTH is watchable but not as nice as UNDER TEXAS SKIES.This is really a pretty good double feature to pick up. I was more than pleased watching these two J.P. McGowan directed Bob Custer B-Westerns. A very good buy for fans.

There seems to be some confusion here concerning the print quality of the ALPHA dvd release version of this 1913 German film. ALPHA is not a restoration firm, ALPHA releases public domain films on dvd for fan/collectors of the obscure and hard to find. And yes, the source for STUDENT OF PRAGUE may very well be an old vhs dupe, but I for one am thankful that I can now finally see this film (and for about 5 bucks) on the home dvd format. Lotte Eisner in her excellent book, THE HAUNTED SCREEN notes that the first 1913 version, "...has survived, and this film, coming six years before CALIGARI, already exhibits many of the properties which one finds in the so-called classical films of the twenties...Nowadays the photography of what is probably the only copy to have survived seems rather grey. One has to remember that the contemporary prints, toned in brown, green or (for night sceens) dark blue, were more subtle."So, like how many great looking prints of this 1913 film are available for release on dvd today? Quite possibly, this is the only one, shabby as it is.Sure, I would like to see CRITERION or KINO come up with a major color-tinted restoration, but who knows how long I'd have to wait for something that may or may not happen in my lifetime. In the meantime I'm really happy that for a very low cost I'm able to view this particular film in it's current state, which is very watchable. The 100yr. old scenes of the characters filmed on the pre-WW1 streets of Prague is alone worth the small asking price of this dvd.Now, I like silent films and have many titles issued by CRITERION, KINO and IMAGE. They all do a wonderful job and are responsible for promoting silent films to today's viewers, making great viewing readily available.ALPHA, however, is a different story. Not a restoration company, they slap an available public domain source onto a dvd for general viewing. Yet ALPHA needs to be commended, because they are indeed the front runner for this sort of thing, and they do bring us some of the most sought after lost classics out there...sticking with the silent/early sound era they've released onto dvd G.W. Pabst's THE MISTRESS OF ATLANTIS(1932), Lubitsch's THE EYES OF THE MUMMY(1922) and Henrik Galeen's 1926 version of THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE...And yes, you can quibble and fault the non-restoration qualities of these films, but until a major restoration firm releases these films I'm just happy to be able to see any of them in my lifetime...but then again, I used to screen silent films on an 8mmm projector on my basement wall accompanied by classical music played on a phonograph. So maybe that's why I'm more acceptable of this version of STUDENT OF PRAGUE, which brings us in a round about way to the actual movie itself, which is about a young man who makes a deal with a mysterious older stranger. In exchange for great wealth the older stranger can remove anything from the younger man's threadbare apartment. The younger man agrees and so the mysterious stranger removes the young man's image from the mirror, hence the story...THIS IS A WATCHABLE FILM, not restored, but certainly watchable. The "new" soundtrack provided comes off like out-takes from a rejected Philip Glass score, and I chuckled when another reviewer noted the same.If you have any interest in silent German Expressionist Film then this is certainly a must buy. Forget those who condemn it for not being restored. That's no reason for not spending a couple bucks to see something you may never get to see in any restored version. And you can always buy the NEWLY RESTORED version later, whenever it becomes available.This is truly a piece of cinema history. Do not deny yourself the chance to witness it...Buy and enjoy.

Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson look as though they were really enjoying themselves during the making of the TRAIL BLAZERS series at the end of their careers as there are lots of quips and good natured ribbing here...This is certainly a pretty good example of just what Monogram studios could offer as B-Western fodder; lots of action, shootings, chases, wild Indians and double-crossing bad guys mixed in with a tinny, pounding musical score.The ALPHA dvd is no way as bad as some of the other reviewers make it out to be. Yes, there were some scratches here and there and a splice or two, nothing to be concerned with. The overall picture was nice and clear and alot better than some other ALPHA releases, especially their Roy Rogers' BELLS OF ROSARITA and ROMANCE ON THE RANGE.No need going into the basic plot. We don't watch these movies for such unimportant things. All you really need to know is that the movie presented here is very watchable, the image is clear, the audio is fine and Hoot and Ken's charm and wit win it all over...I really enjoyed this one and recommend it to fans of such stuff.

This is probably the best, or at least the fan favorite ROUGH RIDERS entry of the series. We have Buck Roberts, Tim McCall and Sandy Hopkins ( our heroes ) drift into town seperately, as usual, to interact with the other cast members in order to solve the mystery killings and goings-on at the ghost town/ abandoned mine. Lots of cobwebs, hidden passages and a spooky old gothic mansion highlight the proceedings. It really has the feel of a 1940's Monogram horror film and one half expects either George Zucco or Bela Lugosi to be the mastermind behind it all. Lots of old time movie fun here with action-packed gunfights and fistfights as well. A great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. And the ALPHA dvd is one of the best I've seen for a ROUGH RIDERS feature, nice and clear, easy to watch......major bad guys to watch for include Tom London, Ben Corbett and of course, everybody's favorite, Charlie King, who gets whupped on good by Buck!

Early (1960) Italian horror film has it all down pat; effective b&w; photography, dark, creepy corridors, stormy nights, gothic castle, mysterious host, age-old vampire curse and naked playgirls! What could possibly be missing? Nothing that would leave me wanting. With the bridge washed out our cuties are trapped inside a decaying castle until they are able to leave, warned not to leave their rooms at night.So what do the playgirls do when one of their own waunders the castle that very night and is brutally murdered, then buried the next morning, wrapped up in a burlap bag and dumped into a shallow grave? They go inside the castle and rehearse their striptease numbers! The show must go on!One of the playgirls resembles a dead 1600's countess and another becomes a vampire. There's a secret lab with bubbling chemicals and some also secret passageways with lots of cobwebs, heavy on gothic charm.When it's all said and done, most of the girls live, and by that time we've seen all of them in various stages of undress, which is a big plus as they're all rather good looking.Nothing meaningful here, just a good time at the vampire's castle. It's all rather well made and not at all embarrasing, even if a tad bit silly at times. I really enjoyed this one and if you're into Euro-Trash cinema, especially gothic horror, then you'll probably like it too.

This is a review for the dvd as pictured which is presented by MOVIE VENTURES. BOOTS & SADLES is an acceptable version; a little grainy, a little soft, but still pretty good overall. The real deal here is a PRISTINE, LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WERE SHOT YESTERDAY version of RIDERS OF THE WHISTLING PINES! This one is as good as the re-mastered Autry-authorized films (from IMAGE)!Now, I got mine in a discount bin & the $17+ bucks being asked here seems a little steep. So if you go through another source be sure you're getting the version as pictured above as MOVIE VENTURES PRESENTS.This is a GREAT buy that can probably be had for peanuts. Shop wisely.

I SAW THIS ON TV BACK IN THE 60'S & REMEMBERED IT BEING PRETTY SCARY WITH A COOL VAMPIRE/WEREWOLF/WHATEVER? TRANSFORMATION SCENE...A STRIPPER HAS HER FACE DISFIGURED (IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD) IN A CAR ACCIDENT & THE ATOMIC VAMPIRE DOCTOR KEEPS HER BEAUTIFUL BY KILLING OTHER WOMEN (IT'S A GLAND THING) INCLUDING HIS ASSISTANT (SHE'S THE HOT ONE OF THE TWO) WHO REALLY LOVES DR. JEKYLL/ MR. ATOMIC VAMPIRE. CRAZY, TRASHY, DEMENTED, SEXY, SLEAZY, FUN !!!THE ALPHA DVD BRINGS THIS RATING DOWN A NOTCH OR TWO. THERE IS A CONSTANT HUMMMMM THROUGHOUT, LOTS OF JUMPS & SPLICES & THE IMAGE ISN'T ALL THAT SHARP AT TIMES. IT SEEMS TO BE MISSING SCENES AS WELL, MAKING VIEWING THIS NEAT LITTLE SCHLOCKER SOMEWHAT CONFUSING...TO ME THIS IS STILL A FONDLY REMEMBERED SLICE OF TV TRASH & I RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL, REGARDLESS...

Both of Sun Records Rockabilly sensations were grinding out films in the early 1960's. However, while Elvis was appearing in Technicolor extravagances and singing of Blue Hawaiis and Kissin Cousins, Johnny Cash was appearing in this b&w no-budget gem as a psycho looser holding a housewife hostage while crooning to her that she's got "FIVE MINUTES TO LIVE"!...weird, it's kind of like Johnny Cash comes to Mayberry to rob the bank, flips out and ends up using Opie as a shield as he attempts a backyard escape through the neighborhood. Actually, that's pretty much what happens. Vic Tayback co-stars as Cash's partner in the bank robbery gone wrong and there are unpredictable jolts of violence and mayhem from Johnny to keep things interesting. Offbeat and strange and a little unsettling at times. Cash is quite good as are most of the other actors in this bare bones production. And Opie is...well, Opie. So even if you buy this one for the novelty, you won't be disappointed because it's really a pretty good movie, and the Alpha dvd print is quite acceptible too.

2 early Roy Rogers films on a one-sided dvd, and 2 good ones they are!First, in THE ARIZONA KID (1939) Roy and Gabby join up with the Confederate Army and have to go up against Confederate renegade Val McBride. Roy's best friend rides with McBride, but Gabby takes care of things.Next, in BILLY THE KID RETURNS (1938) Roy impersonates the famous outlaw and helps Pat Garrett clean up the territory. Smiley Burnette is Frog Millhouse and Fred Kohler is the chief henchman. Both films were directed by action ace director Joe Kane, and the visuals are stunning!Both films have strong plots and good acting all-round. These are 2 very well-made examples of the B-Western and may surprise those unfamiliar with the genre.The prints used appear complete and are clean and quite acceptable, especially BILLY THE KID RETURNS, which looks as though it were being shown in your neighborhood theater TODAY!...CRISP, SHARP, MINT!...And all of the songs appear complete & uncut in both films! So if you're a Roy Rogers fan, or just a fan of B-Westerns this is an absolute must-have! Don't put this one off, it's necessary viewing.

Jerry Warren is(in-)famous for taking bad foreign films, re-dubbing them and adding or re-shooting or re-arranging or whatever to produce a totally incomprehensible film that is always much worse than anything he ever started out with!!!That said, these films always have a brain dead fascination about them that leave your jaw dropping in amazement. Other examples are TEENAGE ZOMBIES, INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD, INVASION OF THE ANIMAL PEOPLE and CURSE OF THE STONE HAND. You've probably seen some of them, or all of them if you're a fan of bad cinema.TERROR OF THE BLOOD HUNTERS(1962) stars Robert Clarke (HIDEOUS SUN DEMON, BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER and MAN FROM PLANET X, the last two directed by cult favorite Edgar Ulmer) as a political/psychological writer/artist imprisoned on Devil's Island who escapes with the warden's daughter and a fellow inmate only to be tracked through stock-footage jungles by the guard who wants to marry the girl. It's all really pretty bad, yet still bad in a fascinating unexplainable way.For a Jerry Warren film this one makes more sense than most and even progresses in a somewhat normal fashion once the actual chase is on, but it's still a stinker.Buy this, it's real cheap, cheaper than that six-pack of beer you'll need to get through this, but by the fourth beer it'll all start making sense, at least it did to me....oh yeah, the print isn't too bad either.

He's just got to be one of the best actors of his time, and Earl Slater just may be his best role ever. It's the meatiest, most complex role in the film and I can't see anyone but Ryan pulling it off. Yes, he's a racist, bigot, yet we see how comfortable he is with his prejudice in his early encounter with the little black girl, a key scene to Slater's psyche, as is the elevator ride which immediately follows. His attitude toward women and relationships could use some work as well. So even though he's bigoted, his mental illness spans several levels, including male, as well as race, superiority. And Robert Ryan, with all the mental tics leftover from BEWARE MY LOVELY, should have garnered an Academy Award nomination here. His scene with Wayne Rogers in a bar is priceless. This is one confused, embittered character, hanging onto life and sanity and even the demise of classic Film Noir, before such a thing was ever known.As for the film itself, I won't give anything away. It's a heist plot devised by an vengeful ex-cop wonderfully played by Ed Begley. Along with Ryan's Slater Begley cuts in Johnny Ingram, a smooth nightclub singer up to his !!! in gambling debts. He's likeably played by Harry Belafonte who also turns in a strong performance and could have and should have made far more movies than he did. His is a complex character in his own right, a nice guy, a loving father who just happens to have a bad gambling habit and loves to party and spend money he doesn't have. He agrees to pull the heist in order to save his little daughter and his ex-wife from mob retaliation.Shelley Winters is great as always as Ryan's long suffering girlfriend who does her best to make him feel like a man, and even Gloria Grahame chimes in a whacky little bit part as the seductive neighbor down the hall in Ryan's appartment complex. But really, it's all Bob Ryan's show here. He steals every scene he's in. ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW may be one of the last great Film Noirs and Ryan holds on as if there were no tomorrow.BOB RYAN HEADS NORTH PART 2?He begins the movie deep within the foul inner city and escapes northward for breath of fresh bucolic air and a much needed second chance at life.This was not the first time...BOB RYAN HEADS NORTH PART 1 happened a few years earlier. Bob was a hard-bitten punk-beating cop in ON DANGEROUS GROUND, who was sent on assignment north of the foul inner city to escape for the first time to the land of clean snow and hunting caps, to clean up his act (and head), to find some sense of being and redemption. This first time around it worked for him. The second time...well I guess you just can't go home again.Both ON DANGEROUS GROUND and ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW are sterling examples Film Noir offering great Bob Ryan performances. Watch them both as a double bill on a winter's afternoon rather than shoveling out the driveway. There's a lot to be learned about life here.The MGM dvd is great. Sharp, clear picture. It's as though you were seeing it in a theater in 1959, maybe even better. I can't recommend this classic enough. Just buy it.

Reading the comments from other reviewers I expected to view a really crappy version of this Pabst oddity as presented by ALPHA DVD. However, much to my surprise and enjoyment, I found the image to be rather clear and quite watchable though the audio had some hiss noise. The awkward cuts and splices were most likely due to editorial decisions resulting in an incoherent plot but manageable running time.Legionnaire Captain St. Avit tells his tale of how he and a comrade were captured after a desert battle and ended up in legendary Lost Atlantis, ruled by the beguiling Queen Antinea (Brigitte Helm of Lang's METROPOLIS). Lots of strange arty photography, dream sequences/flashbacks and bizarre characters all add to the strangeness as St. Avit finally manages to escape and tell his story. He's taken as having a mental breakdown and then flees back into the desert only to be lost in a sandstorm.It looks like big chunks are missing from this very unusual film. Perhaps someday CRITERION can put together the definitive version. But for now, this is probably the best we're going to get. And as I said, the ALPHA print isn't really all that bad, at least not in my opinion. I've seen a lot worse from these guys. Classic German pulp fiction in the Fritz Lang (SPIDERS), Joe May (THE INDIAN TOMB) tradition. Not to be missed. Certainly to be enjoyed.

Even though he get's top billing on the dvd case and is listed as " special guest appearance by..." in the opening credits, Cameron Mitchell does not appear in this horrible movie, except mabbe as a "voice over the phone" appearance as Mr. Big, the crime boss we never see.Now I know that if you're looking for a Cameron Mitchell 1980's action movie you really don't expect much in terms of cinematic art, but you at least expect him to be in the movie!!And this film is truly wretched. The print used is washed out and jumpy. It's hard to see anything happening at night,though you're probably better off for that.Leo Fong, muscular, but somewhat out of shape and dumpy plays a wrongly accused death row convict who gets sprung by W.O.P. (World Organization of Peace) to eliminate a group of evil terrorist types that want to unleash a deadly virus on countries that won't meet their insane demands. They employ slow moving (not slow motion) ninjas that are also somewhat dumpy and very inept. Fong beats them up rather easily.There's a pretty bad helicopter/car rescue scene, some brief nudity, a rat eating out a guy's stomach, bad checkered and stripped threads, several beat-up old cars without hubcaps that get blown up and lots of ninjas running around in costume in motel parking lots in broad daylight! No cops are to be found anywhere. Mabbe they were with Cameron Mitchell in some other movie.Fong and Mitchell did appear together in the equally inept but pretty enjoyable KILLPOINT. Mitchell chews up the scenery pretty good in that one which features a remarkable scene where the bad-guy gun dealers bust in and machine-gun and kill every shopper in a supermarket!!! Lots of exploding shelf items.However, avoid ENFORCER at all costs. It's just a very bad print of a really lame movie. And did I mention that Cameron Mitchell is not in it (or at least not this version). One star is being generous.

Audie Murphy was irrate that this film was not in color and I can see his point. It's a solid Western from an era when color had become the norm in order to compete with television. And Top-Notch it is with excellent acting and direction from the likes of low-budget master Thomas Carr. This is a pretty slick A- Western with lots to like, just too bad, no color. Highly recommended for fans of quality Westerns & Audie Murphy.

I had totally forgotten that signature call sign, but it jumped out at me in a brain flash as soon as Tracy signed off his two-way wrist radio in this classic(???), offbeat cartoon series.Being nearly 50 years since I had seen any of this foolishness, what did I remember before viewing the dvds?1). That I didn't like this show very much, especially the talking dog and his Keystone Kops team. Even as a kid I wanted a more serious show.2). That Tracy appeared only at the beginning and end of each cartoon, dispatching some cartoon cronie to do the field work.3). That Tracy said at the beginning of each show, " Ok Chief, I'll get on it right away."4). That Go-Go Gomez and Joe Jitsu were regulars, rounding up Tracy villains such as Flat Top, The Brow, Mumbles, The Mole, Pruneface and others.After viewing more than my fair share of THE DICK TRACY SHOW, I will say that this show is not very funny. I didn't laugh a whole lot. But I did find myself thinking that these cartoons weren't too bad, at least not as bad as I thought they were going to be. I liked the modernist look and especially the opening credits as the squad car speeds along. And there's an abundance of well-timed quips from heroes and villains alike. Even the dog character, Hemlock Holmes, didn't really bother me now, and he and his Retouchables squad provided the funniest cartoons of the set, though that may be stretching it a bit.The one character that I had completely forgotten was the Andy Devine take-off, Heap O'Calory, but it all came back to me when he got his tips from the bongo playing beatnik, Nick.This is really a great set for what you get: 4 dvds containing all the TRACY cartoons ever made and a nice comic book! But it's hard to get through any more than a half dozen of these cartoons in one sitting, and although they're quick paced and contain some zippy one-liners, they're really not all that funny and are best enjoyed for nostalgic purposes only.

Yeah, these are two of Van Cleef's schlockier Spaghetti Westerns done when the genre was in decline. However, if you really need to see either (or both) of these two gems then this is the one to buy. It's put out by Digiview and is in a slim case as pictured. Both movies (...both of which I happen to like, especially GOD'S GUN) are in pretty good shape and are on a one-sided dvd which prevents scratches common in "flippers".This is indeed a great buy for any Van Cleef/Spaghetti Western fan!If it's still available and you need to see these films (you know you do) then make this purchase. Two Spaghetti Western oddities for peanuts!!! Buy and enjoy...mabbe with some Italian wine and/or beer...and especially CHEESE!!!GREAT STUFF, need more be said?

A lot of viewers dislike this film, and although it's rather slow and confusing I still find it enjoyable on several levels.1) The setting, WW1 Cambodia and the lost city of Angkor which holds the secret of Zombification. The sets look impressive being both creepy and appropriately mystifying.2) The love triangle. Usually I hate this plot device in which the hero wins back his girl after some cad has led her astray. But there are no heroes here. The shy hero-type becomes an egotistical power hungry maniac once he discovers the Zombie Secret. And his backstabbing, dirty, double-dealing girlfriend and best pal rightfully deserve whatever they get dished out. Sadly, it's not enough.3) The acting is pretty good all-round for such a low budget quickie, Dean Jagger being exceptionally good as the confused and betrayed Armond Lougue. You actually begin to feel sorry for the poor sap, until he snaps and becomes a control freak with his newly formed Zombie horde.4) The Zombies are not the living dead type that populated Victor Halperin's previous hit WHITE ZOMBIE(1932), but a sort of mesmerized lot that do one's bidding by mental suggestion via Bela Lugosi's superimposed eyes left over from the previous film. This leads to some tacky cheapness, but it's precisely that quality which makes these low/no budget gems so enduring. So, in a goofy sense, I actually found the film's many faults working in it's favor, enjoying a chuckle here and there, yet all too aware of what this could have been if just handled with a little more care and production value.All said, I enjoyed REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES. It was a pleasing hour or so of neat sets and Zombie nonsense. Just don't compare it to WHITE ZOMBIE or take it too seriously and you'll be ok with it.And the ALPHA DVD print is very good, nice and clear, one of their better offerings, a bargain at such a low price.

I like Buffalo Bill Jr.He looks good, not too handsome, stands tall, wears chaps and pretty much does his own riding, fighting and stunting. In super-cheapie productions like these you really had to be the whole show. His line delivery is awful. He often flubs his lines, but cutting him some slack, so do many of the others in this one-take-only double bill. Still, Jay Wilsey, aka Buffalo Bill Jr., has a habit of reading his lines off cue sheets just off the side of camera range. And still yet, he manages that same quiet, shy charm that made Ken Maynard so enduring to his fans.To put it bluntly, these two movies are pretty bad. They're poorly acted, directed and photographed. And the ALPHA prints are choppy/splicy early on for both features, but settle in and become stable for most of the running times. Both features are very watchable and maintain a sort of home movie quality that adds much to their charm and likeability.I will not go into plot details for either PUEBLO TERROR or WHIRLWIND RIDER, other than Yak Canutt is the lead heavy in one and the equally great George Chesebro is the main villain in the other. If you watch these things, it's not for the plot anyway. All you need to know is that these are two (many considered lost) examples of LOW-budget B-Western film making during that early 1930's sound period, before background music, before singing cowboys. These are cowboy movies of some historical importance. They're fun to watch and are a kind of time trip back to the 1930's. No expensive town sets were built here. They filmed around what was standing and made it fit in.Great stuff, love it.

Yep, that's where Tex & sidekick Chili (Syd Saylor) are headin' to clean up a cattle-rustlin' protection racket. There's lots of hard riding, blazing six-guns & of course, Tex singing. Tex's rough folksy vocals may take some getting used to. He's certainly not smooth like Gene or Roy but seems more authentic and truer to the Western spirit. A lot of Tex's songs seem depressing & sad, about drinking & dying and in this film is one (JAILHOUSE LAMENT) about being hanged that Tex sings as he and Chili sit in jail on a framed murder charge.This is really a great little B-Western, one of Tex's first films. It's directed by vetern Bob Bradbury (Bob Steele's dad) and features lots of familiar cowpokes. Even William Desmond pops up for a brief scene. But it's evil Earl Dwire (who appears in quite a few of Bradbury's films) & scruffy Charlie King who really steal the show, and the cattle as well!Syd Saylor makes a good sidekick here, able to throw a good punch and isn't too bumbling. He does get his standard bobbing adam's apple scene for fans of that kind of stuff.So if you love Cowboy Movies and enjoy seeing Charlie King being whooped-on by Tex then this is your ticket!HEADIN' FOR THE RIO GRANDE is a B-Western classic and a pretty good song too! Enjoy both.

This just may be the definitive recording...yes, others may sound better due to better recording techniques, but this just has that Something Special...the elite of the Nazi regime in audience?...the peak of Nazi power in 1942?...the powerful Furtwangler performance?...the cough that just may be Adolf's?...and all this at a super price!!! I have several 9th's, and some highly acclaimed ones, but this is THE ONE that I always listen to again & again...keep coming back to... like salmon swimming upstream... You just cannot go wrong here. Strongly Recommended!!!

Excellent action-packed 15 chapter serial from Columbia restored by VCI Entertainment. A sheer joy to watch as Buck Jones stars as the title character White Eagle, a white man raised by Indians since childhood. James Craven is at his back-stabbing dastardly best as Dandy Darnell, out to prevent peace between the settlers and the Indians...for his own greedy purposes of course! This role rivals his gang leader in THE GREEN ARCHER(1940) and like that role, is played to the hilt, pure evil interjected with sly humor and comic exaspiration at the failings of his minions!And what minions they are!!! A virtual Who's Who among B-Western cronies and henchmen, some of them even playing good-guy roles! I spotted Bud Osborne, Al Ferguson, Eddie Cobb, Roy Barcroft, George Chesebro, Charlie King, John Merton, Jack Ingram, Hank Bell, Kenne Duncan, Black Jack O'Shea and Edward Hearn. They pop in and out and most wind up pushin up daisies by the end!As with a Columbia serial (especially one directed by James W. Horne) you get lots of running about! Everyone's in a hurry! At times it seems comical with characters running hap-hazardly around and about, through doors, down streets, leaping onto horses!!! But that's what Columbia delivered, Fast-Paced Action! Non-Stop Thrills! And this serial really delivers!Buck is in fine form as White Eagle, mature yet still very atheletic. Raymond Hatton is side-kick Grizzly and does well boasting, providing laughs and even saving Buck on occasion. Dorothy Fay is the love interest and doesn't get in the way too much.The print is BEAUTIFUL!!! Sharp, crisp, clear! A joy to watch! Thank you again VCI for doing such an outstanding job!If you're a serial or Buck Jones fan this is an absolute must for your collection. I'm really glad I made this purchase!

Congradulations to VCI Entertainment for releasing BATTLING WITH BUFFALO BILL (1931) an early Universal talking serial. The print used is EXCEPTIONAL and makes viewing a wonderful experience.Tom Tyler is probably the best looking Buffalo Bill ever, complete with long hair, beard and buckskins! The action is fast and furious and serial fans should readily welcome this addition to their dvd libraries.Jim Rodney played by Francis (director John's brother) Ford is after the gold near Hard Rock and ignites an Indian war to get it. Buffalo Bill, Dave Archer (future cowboy star and lieutenant governor of Nevada, Rex Bell) and John Mills (William Desmond, vetern Western and serial star) are the main good guys thwarting Rodney and his henchmen at every turn. Giving them a hand are stuntman Yakima Canutt as scout Jack Brady and usually bad-guy Ed Cobb as a good townsman. Pretty Lucile Browne (MYSTERY SQUADRON, LAW OF THE WILD) is Dave Archer's sweetheart, needing rescued every now and then, mostly by Buffalo Bill.On the bad side of things Bud Osborne plays back-shooting Joe Tampas and George Regas plays a character named Breed, not unlike similar characters to appear in future Universal Western serials essayed by George Stevens (Snake-eye in WINNERS OF THE WEST,1940).All said, this is a fine example of an early all-talking Western serial, a little crude and disjointed, but quite enjoyable and certainly action-packed! You not only get to see the same Indian shot off his horse at least six times during the 12 chapters but even again during the previews for THE OREGON TRAIL (1939), a Johnny Mack Brown serial!!!This is really a fun time for fans, and again HATS OFF to VCI for releasing a great looking print of BATTLING WITH BUFFALO BILL!...Be sure to buy this one.

Though this may not be on anyone's top 10 serial list this is certainly a top-notch serial by anyone's standards!UNIVERSAL, a studio noted for overly-plotted serials trimmed down this one for fan consumption. Chapters 1-8 consist of finding a painting that holds the clue to a fortune in jewels! Needless to say, the painting switches back and forth throughout all 8 chapters. Then we get to the grist of things when chapters 9-12 deal with badguy Brenda trying to make his getaway with the booty, pirate booty, as much of the serial deals with a pirate ship attraction "THE JOLLY RODGER" as the hideout for the baddies.This is not a great lost serial. Yes, it's lots of fun in the traditional serial fashion. VCI's edition is OUTSTANDING!!!!! by all standards! However, if it only had Kane Richmond or Ralph Byrd or even Herman Brix as the star... but, Scott Kolk???...He's not bad, actually he's pretty good, but rather...forgettable.Monte Blue, Jean Rogers, Lon Chaney Jr., and especially Henry Brandon (who steals the show!!!)are all on hand throughout the UNIVERSAL stock footage and excellent location shooting!This is not a serial to be missed.A MUST-HAVE for fans of such things (like me) and a welcomed addition to the genre, especially in such a beautiful transfer!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!

ALPHA DVD releases a lot of these 1930's "old dark house" mystery thrillers aka Forgotten Horrors. They were made on the cheap to cash-in on the then popular combination of a spooky manor, suspicious guests and a mystery to be solved. They're usually pretty entertaining and fun to watch, and THE POINTING FINGER is no exception.John Stuart stars as Ronnie Rollestone heir to a centuries old manor and the Curse of the Pointing Finger. Ronnie, just wanting to have one last safari adventure before he settles in as the new Earl heads off to Africa, returning not quite the same...I'm grateful that ALPHA keeps releasing these old poverty row features of the early sound period. This one looks good for it's age and for not being restored. ALPHA releases public domain films onto dvd, meaning some may look great but others may look horrible. Most are usually above average, kind of how we saw them on tv in the 1960's. THE POINTING FINGER was very watchable, and very enjoyable as the mystery of the hooded abbot is solved.Great dvd cover too...

I'm giving this five stars sight unseen simply because RIO CONCHOS is finally getting a dvd release! This is one of the best 1960's Westerns and one of my all-time favorites. Richard Boone shines in one of his classic roles, stealing every scene he's in, rivaling his KREMLIN LETTER and NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY performances. Simply great two-fisted action for the Western fan as Boone, Whitman, Fanciosa and Jim Brown ( in his first movie role ) take on Edmond O'Brien's gun-running empire. RIO CONCHOS would make an outstanding double bill with John Wayne's THE COMMANCHEROS, which is pretty much the same film ( done earlier ), and I can't wait to watch them both on a lazy summer afternoon as an excuse to get out of yard work.The second feature on this disc is another Jim Brown Western, teaming Brown up with Spaghetti pro Lee Van Cleef under the direction of Antonio Margheriti. This one, from 1975, is somewhat offbeat as Westerns were looking for something a little different ( yet the same ) to keep the genre alive, and though it's enjoyable it just isn't in the same class as pre-1970 Westerns like RIO CONCHOS.So strap on the ol' sixshooter, fill the canteen and ride the trail down to the RIO CONCHOS. When you get there you'll be humming the Jerry Goldsmith theme for days!

GREAT DVD!!!Tom Tryon is absorbed by alien forces. Wife Gloria Talbott pieces it all together. Dogs kill aliens & save all humanity...That's all you need to know. This is a classic example of cold-war 1950's alien take-over!!!All you need to do is watch this CLASSIC!Don't let the title throw you, this is not some cheepie-hokum to be made fun of...despite the corny title.Tryon went on to author several novels including THE DARK SECRET OF HARVEST HOME (PLEASE RELEASE THIS COMPLETE ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!)I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE is an absolute 1950's CLASSIC & no collection should be complete without Paramount's version which is pristine...rainwater shimmers off pavement...BUY THIS!!!

An outstanding collection of 36 Spaghetti Western previews put out by WILD EAST PRODUCTIONS, a dvd company specialising in releasing eurowesterns, war films and peplums. I love these movies and have stacks of 'em in old large-boxed vhs format. WILD EAST products are offered through amazon and you, like myself, can load up on some off-beat fun films!This preview dvd is nicely produced. Each trailer is introduced by poster artwork which is then shot full of holes! Only a couple of the previews are oft-seen classics: ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE. Most are ones of films you're probably dying to see: RENEGADE GUNFIGHTER, 7 DEVILS ON HORSEBACK, THE DEVIL WAS AN ANGEL, SHOTGUN, A NAME THAT CRIED REVENGE, MAGNIFICENT TEXAN, KILL THE WICKEDS, BROTHER OUTLAW, I'LL DIE FOR VENGENCE, RIO HONDO, SAVAGE GUNS, BULLET IN THE FLESH, etc., etc.All in all, great viewing enjoyment! A nice selection of hard to find previews looking sharp! Highly recommended!

This ALPHA dvd has two nice looking prints of a Tex Ritter double feature. Western Swing giant Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys are featured in TAKE ME BACK TO OKLAHOMA (1940) as Tex and SLIM (Andrews) try to save the Pico Stageline from badguy Storm (Karl Hackett) and his outlaw gang. Tex needs help and sends for Bob 'n the Boys. They arrive singing atop a stagecoach and then perform several songs at a church benefit including the famous "TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA". Tex wins the stage race at the end and saves the stageline.RIDER OF THE ROCKIES (1937) has Earl Dwire and Charlie King leading an outlaw gang stealing cattle on the U.S.-Mexican border. Arizona Ranger Tex goes undercover and joins the badguys as sidekicks Doc (Horace Murphy) and Pee Wee (Snub Pollard) complicate things. Jack Rockwell is leader of the Rangers and Yak Canutt is second in command. This is a good ol' fun time of a movie, one that will certainly leave you with a smile on your face. Good stuff all 'round, good prints, good tunes. Enjoy!

The other reviewer to this Alpha dvd Bob Steele double feature lists these movies as being re-mastered with double dolby digital sound. Now I don't know what he was watching but it certainly wasn't this dvd as BILLY THE KID OUTLAWED is nearly unwatchable and for completest only, as it's the first in the BILLY THE KID series. This movie is so dark and "fuzzy" that it's really a strain on the eyes to try to make out what's happening. There are also alot of splices, drop-outs, cut scenes and a murky soundtrack. Alpha could not have found a print worse than this and it's one of their poorest efforts.As for SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, the second feature, the dvd wouldn't read properly and kept stopping so I couldn't watch it...Alpha puts out public domain films in nice packaging and I own many of their movies. Often these movies are hard to come by on dvd so I'm thankful for Alpha's output. Most of the time these movies are quite watchable, and as in the case of MOST DANGEROUS GAME, very good. It's hit or miss on quality and you take your chance because you want to see a certain film and it's really cheap (and did I mention the nice packaging?).This Bob Steele double feature, judging from BILLY THE KID OUTLAWED is quite bad quality wise. IT'S NOT RE-MASTERED. It's barely watchable, and the dvd didn't play...But, I'm still going to buy another copy because I want to see SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, hoping that it'll somehow justify the cheap purchase price.UPDATE, UPDATE...got a new dvd player and now SUNDOWN SAUNDERS plays perfect with no glitches whatsoever, so it wasn't a faulty disc, just the need for a new machine, 'though this is really the only ALPHA dvd that didn't read for the old player.As for SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, it's the winner I was hoping it would be. The print is very clear, a few audio dropouts early on, but really a nice copy of another great Robert Bradbury, Steele's dad, B-Western, with lots of gritty action and Charlie King, Ed Cobb, Jack Rockwell and Earl Dwire to boot! And yeah, Charlie gets whupped-on pretty good by Steele! Great fun.

Here's an excellent buy! Two Kermit (Ken's brother) Maynard " Mountie Films" from 1935 and both looking quite good for their age.In the opener, HIS FIGHTING BLOOD, Kermit covers-up for his sniveling younger brother Paul Fix (who made a career playing this particular role-type in 1930's B-Westerns) and takes the rap for a jewel robbery. Kermit is later cleared of all charges and becomes a mountie only to come up against...yep, his dirty dealin' more sniveling than ever brother! Kermit puts on several displays of fancy trick riding in this one showing off his talents. A highlight here has Western bad guy favorite Charlie King playing a mountie!?!In the second film, WILDERNESS MAIL, Kermit's twin brother(a mountie) is killed trying to bring in Fred Kohler and his henchmen and Kermit vows vengence. This film is shot on location (at Big Bear, I suppose) in a very deep snow. We get along here by dog-sled & snowshoes...no horses!!!This makes for very interesting viewing. And Fred Kohler is a pretty chilling cold-blooded killer, cracking jokes and even admiring himself on a wanted poster, yet brutal and quite deadly. Kermit goes a little crazy at the end trying to carry out his vengence scheme as the two duke it out in the snow as pictured on the dvd cover. Comic sidekick Syd Saylor plays it straight as one of Kohler's henchmen giving the role some depth, appearing more natural instead of your typical order obeying cronie. I don't even recall seeing Saylor's famous bobbing adam's apple laugh gag which was never really funny to begin with.All-in-all an excellent package for those of us who love this kind of stuff! The prints are nice and clear and very watchable and the audio is quite good as well. A bargain from Alpha Dvd. Highly recommended!!!

This is a really great fun read written by a lifelong fan of THE BIG-G. As a Godzilla fan myself, I find this book to be an insightful overview of not only the films but also of the times when these films were made. Tsutsui covers his subject with style and humor, informative without being academic. This is both a FRIENDLY read and a WELL WRITTEN history of Godzilla and his affect on pop culture then and now. Buy this book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

This is one serial that has it all...lost treasure, lost Indian tribe, lost ghost town!!! Jackie Cooper leads his troop in defeating gangsters bent on securing untold-of wealth! Great chapter endings...over the falls, collasping suspension bridge, mangled by stampeding hordes, etc...Family frendly adventure romp & a fun serial to boot!Sometimes the Universial serials get overlooked for being too plot-driven as opposed to the action-packed slick Republic product or the simplistic/cartoonish Columbia product...but, I will say that Scouts To The Rescue delivers on all cylinders!!!Just enough plot...enough humor...enough thrills to keep fans coming back week after week.A highly enjoyable viewing experience...Enjoy!!!

Great selection of B-Western gems, poor to so-so quality, and I'm cutting slack there.First up, DESERT MAN (1934) in which Wally Wales delivers the "tag line" and saves Peggy Djarling and her ranch from Yak Canutt and his gang. Pretty solid 2-reeler (20+ minutes) but horrible print, faded, splicy, etc.Next up, LOST, STRAYED OR STOLEN (1923), finally my first chance to see a Leo Maloney Western. Another 2-reeler, but in really bad shape. It's certainly watchable, however the print is well-worn to say the least. Famous grizzled bad-guy Bud Osborne (a 1930's-50's regular) is almost unrecognizable as a youthful ranch foreman, yet still as lowly as ever, out to do in our hero Leo, who has a place in B-Western history by producing the first all-talking B-Western OVERLAND BOUND (1929) starring himself, Wally Wales and Jack Perrin. Poor Leo did not live to see his film premier, having died during the promotional tour.Last, we have THE MASTER'S (D.W. GRIFFITH) THE SQUAW'S LOVE (1911) starring future Sennett bathing beauty and comedy star Mable Normand. This is the oldest film presented in this set, now over 100 years old!!! And it's also the BEST-looking film of the three offered. It's less than 15 minutes long, but seeing 100 year old images as a movie are kind of spooky, especially when they look this good.All in all, a recommended buy. Rare stuff here at a cheap price. If you love discovering this kind of entertainment and aren't too fussy about perfection then go for it! After all, what was the last 100+ year movie you saw recently?

I usually try to cut ALPHA dvds some slack because they deal with hard to find films and present them to the the consumer with great packaging at a very low cost. However, their version of THE WAY OF THE WEST starring Wally (my favorite) Wales is quite frankly, horrible. I knew I was in trouble when the opening credit photo shots of the cast began with the henchmen, leaving out the main characters! Jumpy, splicy, blurry, fuzzy, dark. VCI has this in their current catalog, complete and uncut with a Buddy Roosevelt second feature which is also in great shape. The VCI dvd is the one to buy here. Both features are clean, sharp, and bargain priced! ALPHA could have/should have come up with a better print, they're out there...By the way, did I mention how I loved the packaging, a great old poster shot of Wally duking it out with William Desmond...if only ALPHA would have searched as hard for a nice clean print of this movie as they did for the great packaging!

After guest starring in Ken Maynard's feature IN OLD SANTA FE (1934) and serial MYSTERY MOUNTAIN (1934) Gene was given the chance to star in Mascot's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE (1935) when the studio cut ties with the troublesome Maynard. And even though he sang a few songs as an entertainer in IN OLD SANTA FE and the setting for that film was a contemporary Dude Ranch, it's THE PHANTOM EMPIRE that really set up the AUTRY-STYLE as Gene hosts a radio show broadcast live from his own radio/guest/dude ranch mixing his action feats with popular Western tunes. Truly a milestone in B-Western history!TUMBLING TUMBLEWEEDS (1935) for the newly formed REPUBLIC PICTURES is Gene's first starring feature, and what a doozie it is, ranking as one of Gene's all time best, and rightfully so.Lazy and seemingly idle Gene just likes to sit around and sing while his father has to battle intruding nesters. But Gene is really on the ball and sticks up for the nesters only to quarrel with his father and be banished from the homestead. Gene joins a medicine show and returns five years later only to learn that his best friend has been blamed for the recent murder of his father...Gene and Smiley Burnette sort things out with the help of a pre-Gabby George Hayes.This is a GREAT REPUBLIC WESTERN skillfully directed by Joe Kane. The camera set-ups are outstanding, the photography crisp and inventive. It seems so modern for the 1930's. Few films today are so creatively made. Truly a joy to watch!And the IMAGE dvd from the GENE AUTRY COLLECTION is as noted on the cover: FULLY RESTORED! It looks as though it had been released yesterday! I really felt as though I were present in the theater in 1935 watching this gem....Just a side note here in that I want to mention B-WESTERN vetern Jack Rockwell's outstanding performance as McWade. Rockwell played in countless B-WESTERNS during his long career, often as a henchmen but also on the side of the law as well, and this is one of his better outings, if only a personal favorite of mine...All said, a fantastic start for Gene Autry on to a career that would make him perhaps the greatest Western film star of all time.SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!

THIS ONE WASTES NO TIME. WE'RE ONLY MINUTES INTO MAD MONSTER & WE GET TO SEE THE WEREWOLF TRANSFORMATION!!! GEORGE ZUCCO IS OVER THE TOP RAVING MAD IN HIS QUEST TO CREATE AN ARMY OF WEREWOLVES TO BATTLE NAZIS. THOSE WHO SCOFF & RIDICULE HIM ARE MARKED FOR DEATH. GLENN STRANGE PLAYS THE DIM-WIT TURNED WEREWOLF. HE'S GREAT FUN AS BOTH. SOME PRETTY NASTY POVERTY ROW STUFF HERE IN WHICH A CHILD IS MURDERED BY THE WEREWOLF...STILL, ALL IN ALL, THIS IS ONE LOW BUDGET CLASSIC & AN ENJOYABLE ROMP DOWN MONSTER LANE...RECOMMENDED.THE ALPHA DVD VERSION IS PRETTY POOR THOUGH VISUALLY QUITE CLEAR. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE AUDIO, AN ANNOYING HUMMMM....ON THE SOUNDTRACK THAT DISTRACTS FROM THE OVERALL ENJOYMENT...STILL, FOR THE BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS GEM. IT'S MY FAVORITE ZUCCO PERFORMANCE & FOR THAT ALONE A MUST!!!

Just finished watching ALPHA's new dvd of the uncut version (68 min.) of BELLS OF ROSARITA. It's dark and murky and some scenes (especially nightime shots) can't even be made out. Just to see what the actual difference was I pulled out this Platinum/Echo Bridge dvd which offers 5 movies for about 5 bucks on a single sided dvd. BELLS OF ROSARITA is listed here as the 54 min. cut for tv version. Boy was I surprised!!! It clocks in at the full 68 min., and to top it off, the print source used is super clear, light years better than ALPHA's. Images are sharp with good background depth. THIS IS THE ONE TO BUY, PERIOD!!!However, on the same dvd, HANDS ACROSS THE BORDER is listed at it's full running time of 72 min., yet is badly cut and comes in at a mere 52 min. Go figure.

TRAIL OF THE SILVER SPURS is a pretty good B-Western involving some ghost town doings and an on-going gun fight between baddies George Chesebro and I. Stanford Jolley. The boys save the day (and the town) of course. Varying print quality seems to change from reel to reel.I liked Tonto Basin Outlaws better as the boys are after horse rustlers back on Crash Corrigan's old home town turf. Here we find that as a kid Crash belonged to a secret club and was once known as Chipmunk Corrigan. His giving of the club's high-sign is a hoot! Tris Coffin plays his childhood pal who is really the top bad-guy behind everything. Ed Cobb is also on hand as a henchman. The print quality is better than ... SILVER SPURS making this one really enjoyable. So saddle up and ride with Crash, Dusty and Alibi, I'm glad I did!

And that's exactly how THE MYSTERIOUS RIDER (1942) begins. Ride, ride, ride as Buster ( Billy the Kid ) and Fuzzy ( err, Fuzzy ) are trying to outride a posse hellbent on capturing our two heroes, all to the tinny bombastic strains of PRC's stock music library. After fooling the posse with the old empty hat on a rock trick, our pals hide out in a ghost town only to be shot at by badguy Jack Ingram. It seems that Jack's boss , chief badguy John Merton is looking for a lost/hidden gold claim but needs the map he had murdered Old Man Kinkaid for. The map was hidden in Kinkaid's fiddle only to be discovered by Fuzzy after he accidently smashes the instrument. Kinkaid's son and daughter arrive and after Buster saves them and Fuzzy several times the badguys are defeated and our two heroes ride, ride...FUZZY SETTLES DOWN (1944) has Buster ( Billy Carson this time ) and Fuzzy ( err, Fuzzy ) capturing a couple bank robbers and getting a reward which Fuzzy spends at an auction on a newspaper business. It seems that Edith Martin's ( Patti McCarty ) father, newspaper editor John Martin ( John Elliott ) has been murdered by outlaws who don't like what he prints. Now Fuzzy, who just wants to settle down, is the next target. Charlie King, most everybody's favorite badguy, plays the Boss/Brains heavy and John Merton this time 'round is Pete the henchman. Buster again saves Edith and Fuzzy several times as he outwits the outlaws and saves the newspaper and telegraph line the paper was supporting. At the end Fuzzy decides he'd rather not settle down and scrambles after Buster to ride, ride...I'm not sure exactly what it is, but these old 1940's PRC and MONOGRAM B-Westerns sure have something going for them. Maybe it is that pounding soundtrack music, maybe it's just the comfortable familiar plot, or the same dusty roads, hideouts and towns we're so used to seeing time and again. But I think that it just may be all the old familiar faces that continually pop in and out of these things; Charlie King, Jack Ingram, Kermit Maynard, John Merton, Hal Price, Ted Adams, George Cheseboro, Glenn Strange, Karl Hackett, I. Stanford Jolley, Tris Coffin, Bud Osborne, Ben Corbett, Kenne Duncan, Robert Kortman, Tom London, Steve Clark, Slim Whitaker...well, you get the drift. Women didn't matter. They all were pretty much the same, interchangable, forgotten. The young cowboys in the theater identified with the heroes, sidekicks and especially with the badguys, perhaps because they knew they couldn't ever be that good, or maybe they liked being a little bad; it all seemed so daring. And badguys didn't have to worry about dressing up or having good manners, and they got to belong to a gang.But even when the heroes and sidekicks changed at PRC and MONOGRAM and became LONE RIDERS, RANGE BUSTERS, TEXAS RANGERS, whatever, there were always the constants; the tinny pounding music, those dusty roads, the town and hideout and best of all, the same BADGUYS, again and again and the kids loved them like old friends, even though they were bad!So, yeah these two BILLY THE KID/CARSON programmers may not be CITIZEN KANE or some other art film of the 1940's, but if you don't take them seriously and just sit back and enjoy them for what they are, I believe you'll really have some great fun here. Buy and enjoy. I did.

Though AMAZON lists this at 90min it comes in at 55 as noted on the ALPHA dvd packaging, so don't think you're finally going to get an un-cut version of this Autry classic!The LIGHT CRUST DOUGHBOYS and the JONES BOYS are even featured in the credits, but do not appear in the film. I really wanted to see them play and sing! The BEVERLY HILL BILLIES (the original ones) do show up early in the film before Gene attends the TEXAS CENTENNIAL disguised as cowboy movie star Tom Ford.I do think a lot of the scenes showing off the TEXAS CENTENNIAL have also been left on the editing floor along with some Max Terhune and Elmer (the puppet) Sneezeweed stuff.Still, all said, this is a very enjoyable Gene Autry western with clever (in show-biz) lines, great Autry songs and a glimpse of the 1936 TEXAS CENTENNIAL!!!I have this un-cut on vhs but that copy is unwatchable, a 20th generation copy that strains the eyesight...so I've never been able to watch it completely through.Oh well, maybe the people over at the Autry Museum will release a beautiful remastered complete version through IMAGE dvd as they have done with so many other Gene Autry films...we can only hope, and wait.

Both films on this ALPHA dvd HONOR OF THE MOUNTED (1932) and SILENT VALLEY (1935) are presented with nice clear prints, SILENT VALLEY the better of the two. This offers the viewer a good example of Tyler's starring era in the 1930's, when he was at the peak of his career as a leading man in sound B-Westerns.In HONOR OF THE MOUNTED, Tyler plays mountie Tom Halliday, suspiciously found at the scene of a murder (it looked like a case of self defense to me) with the murder weapon in his hand. He's given six months to find the real killer and as the climate moves from winter to summer Tom moves from Canada into the USA, so he must be nearing the end of his line. Posing as a fur trapper Tom soon (or finally) catches up with the culprit and solves the case. Usually bad guys, both Earl (billed here as William) Dwire and Charlie King wind up on the good side of the law for once, Dwire actually as a deputy!!!SILENT VALLEY has sheriff Tom making little progress against a cattle rustling gang headed by smoothie Al Bridge. Slim Whitaker is appointed as a deputy to help Tom when in reality he's a gunfighter/killer cronie of Bridge's.Charlie King is the lead henchman, just how we like him cast, and winds up dead as usual. Wally Wales is also on hand as the troubled brother of Tom's girlfriend, in with the gang, but coming to his senses, just in enough time not to be killed off, as is so often the case.So here's a nicely packaged Tom Tyler 2-fer of pretty good Westerns, both decent prints, and a great way to pass a snowy afternoon, which is what I just did.

First came across Al Clauser & his Oklahoma Outlaws while watching a Gene Autry B-Western in which he hires the boys as ranch hands based solely upon their singing & swinging abilities. I remember Clauser & company turning out to be Government Range Agents or some such stuff as Gene & Frog (Smiley Burnett) go after outlaws and save their ranch.As for this cd, it's great Western Swing, nice clear transcripts of very enjoyable, infectious music circa 1937-46, mixing both intrumentals & vocals. You just gotta love it. This is feel good music that more than grows on you. You may even run the risk of being obsessed by it and wanting to check out Bob Wills & The Texas Playboys, Spade Cooley, The Light Crust Doughboys or many others as their were many Western Swing/Cowboy bands from this era. And many have made it to cd for all of us to enjoy.Like I said, a great set of 33 Western Swing tunes just waiting for you to enjoy.., go ahead. You just can't help but to love it.

VCI offers a nicely restored version of the Johnny Mack Brown serial FIGHTING WITH KIT CARSON and this is the one to get, period.As for the serial itself, it's a good one. A shipment of government gold is hidden by Matt Fargo when attacked by Indians and Mystery Riders. Kit Carson is accused of treachery and must prove himself and uncover the real culprit, outlaw chief and scene stealing Noah Berry as trader Noah Kraft. Berry's son, Noah Jr. plays Carson's Indian sidekick and child trick rider Betsy King Ross is Joan Fargo, Matt's daughter, though he appears about 70 and she 10 , who for some reason disguises herself as a boy named Johnny and although everyone knows she's a girl they all refer to her as a boy. This is the most confusing part of the plot, even more so than where the gold is hidden.We get lots of hard riding and pitch battles between Kit's band, the Mystery Riders, who sing as they ride, the Indians, the cavalry, the pioneers/settlers and the regular outlaws. This is all fast-paced and fun, reminding us what a thrilling afternoon one could have at a 1930's movie theater!Johnny Mack Brown is a likeable hero and Betsy King Ross isn't obnoxious as the little boy/girl. But, as usual, the real treat always comes with the badguys. Noah Sr. is just great chewing scenery and spittin' it out as if he were in a Shakespearian play! And Al Bridge (Reynolds) and Maston Williams (Chuck) are in top form as the two top slimeball heavies. Lane Chandler, Tom Tully, Lafe McKee and lots of familiar faces abound.Needless to say, Kit is cleared of all charges, the gold is recovered and the Mystery Riders sing their last song. A great way to spend an afternoon, riding along in all that wonderful "shot on location" scenery featured in VCI's crisp, clear print!

Universal has the reputation of delivering plodding serials. I disagree. They just add more plot than Republic or Columbia, and in the strange world of serials, this seems to slow things down a little. But fans of Universal love their serials being treated in a more respectible fashion, more like an actual feature film.Addison Richards, usually a bad-guy boss, plays the falsely accused father of our mountie hero and Milburn Stone, usually a hero in Universal serials, plays the no-good bad-guy!!! Bill Kennedy is a bland hero-type mountie and George Dolenz plays his equally bland sidekick Frenchy!!!Character actor Paul E. Burns plays a shady character named Latitude Bucket. You never know for sure who's side he's on and he's fun to watch, pretty much stealing every scene he's in! Robert (KING KONG) Armstrong is another baddie and Ray Taylor, an old hand at these things, directs.All-in-all, this is an interesting, well-made romp down memory lane for vetern serial watchers. Good stuff all 'round. Recommended.

Outstanding early Republic serial! This one has it all: thrills, spills and action! action! ACTION!Robert Livingston stars as Don Loring/The Eagle, a masked avenger out for revenge against those who murdered his family who also happen to be linked with a band of Russian cossacks?!? out to conquer California in the 1840's. Loring returns from Fremont's expedition along with sidekicks Salvation(Guinn BIG BOY Williams) and Whipsaw(Raymond Hatton) just in time to thwart Jason (Fred Kohler) Burr's Napoleonic vision of absolute dictatorship. William Farnum potrays Father Jose who hides the Eagle's true identity and Kay Hughes provides the romantic interest getting kidnapped every now and then. John Merton is Burr's #1 henchman ordering about Bud Osborne and Jack Ingram among other familiar faces to the also familiar strains of Franz Liszt's Les Preludes. It doesn't get much better than this!The Alpha dvd is wonderful! Just as good as my Republic vhs and we all know what wonderful video tape releases Republic put out in the 1990's!So if you're looking for an excellent dvd of an outstanding serial than this is the one you want! And the bargain price seals the deal! Buy and enjoy!

A previous reviewer seems to keep posting reviews for VCI ENTERTAINMENT's products rather than the ALPHA titles listed. I noticed this on several B-Western and serial reviews. I like VCI and their product is very good, just don't get the idea that you're going to be watching a pristine mint LOOKS AS THO IT WERE FILMED YESTERDAY Bob Steele cowboy oater. It just ain't gonna happen. And don't get confused into thinking that what you're ordering is something other than the ALPHA product.As for ALPHA's print of this Billy the Kid series entry, it's so-so, a little faded, scratchy, the usual public domain quality, tho some scenes are nice and sharp and the running time is 61min., which is pretty close to complete.As for the movie itself; Billy (Bob Steele) and his two sidekicks Fuzzy (silent comedy star Al St. John) and Jeff (Carleton Young) come across baddie Al Ferguson trying to chase pretty Louise Currie and her father Karl Hackett off a dead man's ranch he'd sold them. Bob/Billy tricks Ferguson into buying the ranch back after several fist and gunfights with henchmen Charlie King, Rex Lease and Kenne Duncan. Usual heavy Ted Adams plays the sheriff this go-round.This is a very entertaining entry giving Bob every chance to throw many punches, shoot and ride! For the price you really can't go wrong...as long as you don't think you're getting some super dolby digital re-mastered crisp print of a PRC B-Western. It just ain't gonna happen.Buy and enjoy. Recommended for what it is.

For some reason this movie has alluded me over the years, and now I'm glad for the chance to see it. The ALPHA dvd is very good, or at least so by my standards, and I let you know if an ALPHA dvd is substandad (BELLS OF ROSARITA for example).Great, and I do mean GREAT direction by that un-sung master of the REPUBLIC B-Western Joe Kane, who comes off unduly as a sort of low budget John Ford. Wonderful composition shots, well-framed with an artsy feel. You have to admire the skill and workmanship that went into shooting this low budget programmer.As for the plot; like so many of Roy's by Kane from this era, it's almost surreal,or dreamlike with harsh reality mixing easily with cornpone humor and downhome songs.Roy is co-owner of a ranch with Milt Brower whose former badguy cronies show up one day and want to involve him in a grand cattle rustling scheme. Milt refuses, gets framed then captured, and needs to be vindicated by Roy.What we have here is Roy and friends singing carefree on a hayride, featuring songs by the then popular duo of LULU BELLE and SCOTTY, punctuated by the downright nastiness of actor Stanley Andrews (...later the TV old ranger on DEATH VALLEY DAYS) who would appear more comfortable in a Sam Peckinpah Western in the late 1960's. He's mean and nasty and chiding (as are his henchies) almost before his time in cinema. These are truly characters out of PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID or THE WILD BUNCH and they really offset the goings on with Roy and his picnic party crowd!!!However, when Roy later sneaks up on the outlaw camp, climbs up the rock wall and shoots several of the outlaw guards from ambush (without fair warning), this almost comes across as even more disturbing than the viciousness of Andrew's (Pa Jackson's) gang!So what you have here is probably something you've never really seen before (unless you're a fan of this stuff): comedy, songs, friendly down home people, murderous sadistic villians and cruel violence. Even vetern heavy Jack Ingram pops in for a few quick minutes as a paid bushwhacker out to shoot Roy in the back only to get blasted for his effort. Rather than bringing Ingram's body back into town Roy informs the sheriff that the body is lying back out on the trail.These were weird times, and this is an example of REPUBLIC STUDIO's great output in the B-Western field of the mid 1930's. Gene Autry and The 3 Mesquiteers also provided essential viewing from the same studio...Try any combination of these Republic Roy/Gene/3 Mesquiteers series and I'm sure you'll be hooked!......Light years better than anything being offered on TV today.

Here are two very rare early B-Western shorts. Jack Perrin's THE APACHE KID'S ESCAPE (1930) lasts 45min. and is in pretty good shape for one of the first cowboy talkies. It seems that bad-guy turned good, the Apache Kid, gives his pal his bandit's scarf to be given in turn by the pal as a present to the girl he loves. The pal (Fred Church), who is flat broke and can't afford to buy his girl (Josephine Hill) a gift, uses the scarf to rob from his own crooked father and of course, the Kid gets blamed. Perrin is a very acceptable and likeable cowboy hero and sorts things out in well under an hour. Bad-guy Bud Osborne plays an ex-partner of Perrin's who goes over a cliff in the final fistfight. Osborne is rather young looking here and has some good scenes as a back-stabbing snake. It's great watching these early circa 1930 sound Westerns, the images of landscape from a changing West that will soon give way to expansion of a rapidly developing Los Angeles.The second short runs about 15min. and is super cheap. It stars cowboy favorite Wally Wales (future henchman/sidekick Hal Taliaferro) and the film's director Victor Adamson (aka Denver Dixon) as sidekick Blister (I suppose because of his bothersome corns!). He's billed here as Al Mix and is also the father of future schlock director Al Adamson (BRAIN OF BLOOD, DRACULA VS FRANKENSTEIN) who was murdered in the 1990's.THE ADVENTURES OF TEXAS JACK (1934) looks to have been most likely part of an abandoned serial and although it is not in very good shape is a very interesting example of no-budget Western film making of it's time.Rossini's William Tell Overture appears here for the first time in a Western, long before THE LONE RANGER made it famous...and of course, Wally Wales was one of the original Rangers in Republic's classic THE LONE RANGER serial (1938, as Taliaferro).So a GREAT BIG THANKS!!! to ALPHA video for making this rare and quite enjoyable Western double feature available and at a very affordable price to boot!Buy and enjoy, super highly recommended!

Once thought lost, and maybe all the better for that, this is certainly a very poorly made film. But being a shoestring B-Western this clunker really holds one's interest, or at least it did mine. Somehow you just can't believe they're actually filming this and therefore it's inherent weirdness becomes fascinating, compelling you to become mesmerized by it's sheer incompetence as the film draws you slowly into it's web of bewilderment.Whew, that's saying a lot for so little. But I actually enjoyed watching this film and applaud those involved for making a movie with obviously so many budgetary constraints. It only lasts around 50 minutes and any attempt at plot and/or characterization is absolutely mind-numbing...But here goes the good, the bad and the ugly of it.The good:Nice location shooting at what appears to be The Grand Canyon.A Cisco Kid type bandit/hero who is appealing despite the bad accent.A rough, realistic look to the whole thing. No fancy set designs here.Charles Stevens, known to all B-Western fans for wearing the same clothes and playing a half-breed scoundrel in many Universal serials of the 1930's, going by names like Snake-Eyes, Breed and Puma, actually appearing here as a good guy, trusted friend to the hero. This is a refreshing change (of clothes) for Stevens and especially for his fans.Really great dvd cover artwork from ALPHA. They're especially good at this.The bad:No budget at all. This is really a shoddy movie, but that somehow seems to work in it's favor, adding to the overall charm of the whole thing.Some scripting confusion. Is a reel of this once lost B-Western still lost? If so, that may clear up some issues and push the running time closer to 60 minutes.Lots of viewers brought up on today's digital and technological standards will most likely hate this cheapie 1934 home movie, but that's where most of the film's unique charm derives from.The ugly:Poor print, jumpy and splicy, but certainly watchable. I don't think that you'll ever see a much better version than this around any time soon, as though you would ever care to.Missing chunks? Or just badly filmed? Who knows?The dvd bills Ken Thompson as the star. As far as I know, there is no Ken Thompson in this film . The lead, Don Adios, is played by Pat Carlyle who also directed. Merrill McCormick played the lead badguy Chuck Reynolds, and aside from the aforementioned Charles Stevens, there are no other major male roles in this film. Carlyle went on to play a similar Cisco Kid hero in 1935's equally inept THE IRISH GRINGO, but that's another story.One can laugh aloud at the goings on in this film, and would probably have every right to do so, but I found this film to be enjoyable in an odd sort of way, as though I were witness to someone's 1934 home movie of what they thought a B-Western should be.Bottom line:Highly recommended, you bet.

This is a pretty enjoyable curio for B-Western fans. Hero Rex Lease and co-pilot Clyde Cook (former silent comedian) force land their bi-plane below the border sometime during the Mexican Revolution and are captured by liberating bandidos. There's some humor poked at the "liberators" as they "viva" this and that, when all they want to do is rob and steal. Rex and Clyde are forced into the gang and made to take part in robbing the local pueblo. Later the good citizens identify our pals as bandits and they have to dig their own graves before facing the firing squad. They also manage to find time to save a pretty young senorita from a forced marriage to the jefe of the bandidos.I liked this early (1930) B-Western talkie for several reasons.1) I don't expect much from early sound B-Westerns, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well this film came off. For being shot outdoors and on location the sound recorded very smoothly and did not appear awkward.2) The opening scenes are of the U.S. Army border patrol at camp. We get to hear them sing "You're In The Army Now". You don't often see WW1 era soldiers on the Mexican border in B-Westerns. This was interesting.3) Lots of extras in this film. Street scenes, cantina, chase sequences all have lots of extras. Maybe they actually filmed in Mexico where extras were readily affordable. The location shooting looks good wherever they were.4) The dialogue has some wit and charm to it. I found it more natural than some early B-Westerns of the same period which usually have a stilted delivery designed solely to move the plot along.5) The two pals are likable and the senorita a real cutie, even though she can't climb out a window.6) ...and lastly, Clyde Cook. Never heard of him, never seen him before. He's supposed to be a former silent comedy star. I liked him and his "...hello, hello, hello" bit. A loser sidekick to be sure, but not a complete idiot or just downright annoying. He has a nice sense of timing, like a good silent comic. And he has a running routine throughout the film in which he attempts to change out of an oversized pair of baggy pants into a comfortable fit, but gets caught every time he drops his drawers, leaving him in an uncomfortable situation, as he then scurries off holding up the baggies. It reminded me of a Buster Keaton type routine and is done with excellent comic timing. I'd like to see some of this guy's silent comedies.So, if you don't expect too much, you'll come away from this all the better for the experience. It's a rare 1930 B-Western/Aviator/Mexican Revolution film with good sound, some interesting dialogue and nice location choices.And it looks good too. The image is quite clear for such an early film, though not restored. I was very happy with this purchase from ALPHA. Nice cover too.

Jack Perrin's best days as a cowboy hero were during the silent 1920's. He later appeared as the lead in several low budget early sound efforts but by the late 1930's had drifted strictly into supporting roles. The two features presented here are from Jack's last gasp as a cowboy star and leading man. He's not too bad, but hardly memorable, perhaps a tad too old for the roles he plays, but competent and somewhat likable. As for his acting ability, let's just say he's WAY better than Buffalo Bill Jr. or Bob Custer and just leave it at that.The two films presented on this ALPHA dvd are two of Jack's better outings, and I must say that they both look pretty good for public domain B-Westerns. I felt that both video and audio were above average and that actual film damage was minor with only a few splices or jump-cuts. The visual image for both films was better than acceptable.In the first, WILDCAT SAUNDERS(1935), Jack play a boxer who gets wholloped because he's out of shape. His manager thinks that Jack needs to get away from big city temptations and whisks our hero out west so can can re-train and get back into form. Of course Jacks immediately runs into a pretty girl and uncovers a jewel robbery. Tom London is the big galoot who keeps getting pounded by Jack in coyote/roadrunner fashion. A good enjoyable B-Western that does have some offensive racial humor, though it is "Snowflake"'s quick thinking that actually saves the day.In Wolf Riders(1935) Jack, as a child, is orphaned only to be raised by Chief Red Wolf who brings our hero up as a truthful, honorable man. When Jack reaches adulthood it's time to set things right. The always excellent George Chesebro plays badguy Al Pearce and old-timer Lafe McKee is the Indian Agent. Pretty Lillian Gilmore is the romantic interest. This is the more serious of the two films and I liked it the best, though they were both pretty good.Like I noted, the ALPHA dvd presents two really good looking Jack Perrin films at a super price. Let's face it, you just don't find this kind of stuff around much anymore. ALPHA is the only company I know of that constantly puts out tons of B-Westerns and other obscure poverty row features on a regular basis. And no, these films aren't restored to the digital quality of CITIZEN KANE or KING KONG, but they are actually there, these lost, low budget forgotten gems for fans of such stuff to finally get an opportunity to see and enjoy... And that's important.

So many sexy woman always manage to walk alone at night along sinister streets and alleyways when a mad rapist/killer is on the loose! They're just asking for it...and Franco films it all with stylish camera angles among gothic German locations!Great little horror mystery with a tight script and fine acting. Is the ghost of the sadistic Baron Von Klaus really reponsible for the gruesome killings or is it someone more human? The killer appears to have stepped out of Bava's BLOOD AND BLACK LACE, only Franco's film was made years earlier!The winter location shooting adds a nice touch, there's a rough nudi torture/murder scene and it all manages to come off as a stylistic art film. An absolute must-have for Jess Franco fans and lovers of b&w; Euro horror of the 1950's-60's.Highly recommended!

GREAT... WACKY... TRIBAL... PULSATING...MONDO...WEIRD...20+ minutes of VOODOO SUITE, kindda like Martin Denny lost in the Twilight Zone!!! ST. JAMES INFIRMARY is also REALLY STRANGE (unique).In fact, the whole DOUBLE-ALBUM cd rocks/swings/grunts/moans & hypnotizes the listener into craving more. This is REALLY a pretty good time & I loved every minute of it. Give it a try...just imagine Ricky Riccardo & Fred Mertz having the lead roles in the cult film FORBIDDEN ZONE...Oingo Boingo!!!

This is a truly wonderful set of all L&H; sound shorts and features from the Roach studios. They've never looked better, probably not even when they were first released! Watching a favorite like PERFECT DAY in such pristine condition is almost frightening considering that what we are seeing is now over 80 years old.This release was well worth the wait, and with so many positive reviews posted I wasn't about to chime in my two cents, except...It would be nice to some day see the Laurel and Hardy silent shorts being given the same quality treatment. I know that I'm not the only one out there that wants the silent shorts as well. Does anyone have any info on this? Will we have to wait another dozen or so years for this to happen? And PLEASE, if it does ever happen, NO manufactured-on-demand pricy dvd-R junk.For now, I'll just keep my fingers crossed.

AKA GAMERA VS. BARUGON THIS IS THE FIRST GAMERA MOVIE SHOT IN COLOR, BUT IT'S REALLY BARUGON WHO IS THE STAR OF THIS ONE! GAMERA APPEARS EARLY IN TINTED FLASHBACK SCENES FROM THE ORIGINAL B&W; GAMERA FILM & THEN QUICKLY RETURNS TO EARTH FROM THE COSMOS TO BLOW UP A DAM. NEXT WE GET A STORY ABOUT 3 TREASURE HUNTERS WHO THINK THIS BARUGON-EGG IS SOME GEM WORTH A FORTUNE. ONE TREASURE HUNTER DIES FROM A SCORPION BITE & THE 3RD TRIES TO KILL THE 2ND & MAKE OFF WITH THE GEM. ANYWAY, BARUGON HATCHES & GOES ON THE EXPECTED DESTRUCTIVE RAMPAGE. TREASURE HUNTER #2 & HIS ISLAND/NATIVE? GIRLFRIEND RETURN AS DOES GAMERA FOR THE FINAL MONSTER BATTLE!!! TREASURE HUNTER SCUMBAG #3 & BARUGON GET THEIRS & ALL ENDS WELL...PLAYED STRAIGHT, NO LITTLE KIDS TO GET IN THE WAY, THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD MONSTER BASH WHICH I'VE WATCHED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS...HOWEVER...THE ALPHA DVD IS REALLY PRETTY BAD WITH WASHED-OUT COLOR. I COMPARED IT TO THE EXTENDED PLAY VHS I HAVE " GAMERA VS. BARUGON " & THE VHS WINS HANDS DOWN. IT'S PACKAGED AS CELEBRITY HOME ENTERTAINMENT(1987) UNDER THEIR " CELEBRITY JUST FOR KIDS " SERIES WHICH FEATURES OTHER GAMERA FILMS AS WELL. THE COLOR HERE IS SO MUCH BETTER (AFTER I'VE ADJUSTED THE TRACKING). THIS IS THE SANDY FRANK EDITION WHICH I UNDERSTAND HAS AWFUL DUBBING( SEEMED JUST FINE TO ME-I LIKED THE INANE LINES ), BUT IS THE MORE VIOLENT UNCUT VERSION. WHATEVER...ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT MY OLD VHS WAS LIGHT YEARS BETTER THAN WHAT ALPHA HAS OUT THERE ON DVD.

This is an obscure 1935 no-budget gem. Buck Coburn aka Rocky Cameron was really stunt man and horse trainer Gene Alsace who got the lead in this forgotten oater when low class star Montie Montana was unable to sign on. The story is nothing special, the old sheep vs cattle range war, and even for a low budget effort this has got to be one of the lowest yet.However, this movie has more cowboy lingo and slang packed into it's 55 minute running time than any 10 other B-Westerns lassoed together. The good guys and bad guys exchange barbed colloquialisms at and with each other. Lots of this stuff is sharp and quite funny, especially lines coming from Bud Osborne (bad guy) and Ben Corbett (good guy) before, during and after gunplay, or just plain ribbing each other. Some of this dialogue appears downright mean spirited, except for being delivered with a sly grin. I find it all to be pretty refreshing stuff.No big sets here. Everything is shot on the cuff, giving the proceedings a realistic look and feel. And whatever town set they used, I must say that I've never seen so much horsecrap on the streets!!! Talk about realistic. I can image the flies and smell. And townspeople just sit there on the steps and walkways taking it all in. You won't see that on the GUNSMOKE tv series. As for the look of the film itself, there's even some modest camera movement, tracking in and out of several shots when a static set-up is what we're most used to. Not that this is some lost art film, it's still a pretty poor production, but I found it to be an interesting one as well.Coburn/Cameron/Alsace, though not the best cowboy hero to ride the poverty row range, wasn't too bad in the lead role, actually quite acceptable. The real stars are the bit parts played by Osborne, Corbett, Lafe McKee and several others. Yeah, they may muff a scene or two (one take only seemed the rule), but they all created memorable, well rounded characters out of their little screen time and limited lines.The ALPHA dvd is rather nice, a clear picture with good sound, better than usual.

I really like this one. There are 10 GREAT songs here & the sound is quite good. It's 30 minutes of just what I need to hear, Howlin' doin' the classics: I ASKED FOR WATER...HOW MANY MORE YEARS...MOANIN' AT MIDNIGHT...EVIL...HIGHWAY 49...If you're just starting out and want to sample CLASSIC Howlin' Wolf, or if you just want to sample rough down'n dirty blues then this is your ticket!!! And it's a bargain to boot!!!
