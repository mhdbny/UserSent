WW1 never seems to get much coverage in films... especially the early days of aviation portion.Most WW1 films focus on the horrors of the ground warfare.FLYBOYS deserved to do better at the Box Office.I confess, I had never heard of this film until I saw it on the shelves at Blockbuster, but am glad I grabbed it.Better than 90% of the films coming out these days.The romantic side story seemed a little awkward and forced in a "Titanic" sort of way... but I understand why it was added to widen the scope of the film.Also the CGI work on the air combat maneuvers was very good.I am considering purchasing this one for my collection.

It is great to finally see Hollywood stay pretty close to the actual darkness and storyline of a character as he was originally written.The Batman of the 1930-1940s was not the campy characters often seen in the 1960-1970s TV series.There are a few moments of humor in this movie, but not the usual comic farse Hollywood seems to throw into everything they make these days.This Batman is about as close to authentic as we can probably ever expect from any major studio.True, there are some minor complaints and areas where the film could have been improved upon, but this would be nitpicking.The one MAJOR NEGATIVE in this film is Katie Holmes !!!Ugghhh.... what terrible casting.It is hard to imagine how the Casting Dept chose her for this role.Her screen presence is bad, she does not fit the role, her acting is below par compared to other actors on the screen and there is ZERO chemistry between her and Christian Bale.An actress like a Naomi Watts or Kate Beckinsale would have been much better in that role !

Okay, okay I know there are fans of this movie that will want to make me walk the plank for this review...BUT...... I was unable to get interested in this movie in the least !!!!!I tried twice to sit down and watch this movie but each time my mind wandered to other things. The movie simply did not grab my interest or attention in the least.Naval battle.... get drunk and eat... naval battle... get drunk and eat... that got old real fast.I found myself grabbing magazines to read and other things to distract me while this movie played.The second time I turned to my wife and asked... "Do you mind if I stop this movie ?"Her reply.... "Go ahead. I'm not watching it anyway. I fell asleep first time and this time I'm doing needlepoint. This film is lame and boring."So we never made it past about 50 minutes before just giving in to pure boredom and the mental torture of dragging thru this bloated artsy-fartsy film.Great cinematography... great costumes.... great historical accuracy... but if I want a documentary I'll watch History Channel and actually enjoy a real history lesson.... not Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral or whatever.

Excellent job. It is easy to see the energy and effort put into remaking this epic.The only reason I go with 4 star instead of 5 is simply because somehow the blending of live action and CGI as good as it is, still seems to be missing some sort of realism I can't put into words.The original as crude as it may seem by today's standards still tugs at the emotions more than this hi-tech version.There is still something about CGI no matter how good it is that seems to emotionally seperate you from the character and not accept them as real somehow.But this IS the best CGI ever put on film hands down !!!This is a great film that will be added to my DVD collection.

I won't waste many words to describe this 147 minute long movie.One word says it all... HORRIBLE.This rates among some of the worst crap I have seen put to celluloid in years..... The cinematography and effects are top notch but like virtually every film adaption of a Steven King story ever done (except Shawshenk Redemption and Carrie) this movie is terrible.My wife asked if Ed wood was still alive while watching it.. that should say enough.Whew...... bad....bad ....bad.

It is somewhat amusing to read some of the criticisms of the movie on here.... some criticize Eastwood's "Right Wing Conservative politics" in the film, while just as many complain that he is pushing "liberal values"... makes you wonder how many people still form their own opinions and views on things today and how many are simply programmed by the media to express the views they have.The film was well done overall despite it's predictability and overshadows of "Shawshank Redemption" stylization.In fact is it interesting to see the same formula Clint has used in his last 5 films.... he has a certain 5-point formula he has used identically in Unforgiven and all his other recent films.But it is a formula that works for him.This is worth seeing but it not the sort of DVD I would add to my collection to watch over and over again.

Bruce Willis unfortunatley wastes his talents on 16 BLOCKS.Basically this movie is a rehash of Clint Eastwood's far superior THE GAUNTLET.Most annoying in this film is Def's character who speaks with such an exaggerated NASAL tone to his voice that you wish he would get shot just so you can stop listening to him and have the film end quicker.

When Hollywood makes a remake of a movie that was not good in the first place about a story that has in recent years been revealed as a hoax, I should have done a better job convincing my wife to pass this one over on the Blockbuster shelf.ANNOYING is the best word to describe it.As opposed to having any real sense of doom, fear or foreboding the film stoops to using LOUD SUDDEN spikes of music every 20-30 seconds to try and create suspense.The result is ANNOYING.... much like a neighbor playing his music too loud at a weekend block party.Every 20-30 seconds we seem to get a "TA-DA" full orchestrated chordal harmony in either Em-F or G#m-Aregardless of what is happening on the screen.Adding insult to energy is the music is 20X louder than the dialogue so it becomes an ANNOYING film to try and watch.Also..what is all this hype about "The mystery has never been solved and explained ?"It is pretty well established these days that the whole Ammityville House story was a hoax concocted by the family.Several documentaries have already covered this on TV over the years.... so what's they big mystery.I normally would not have written this review because I knew better to rent it in the first place... but the wife insisted and likewise regrets it now.

Simply stated this is the best Comic to Movie adaption ever produced yet.Usually Hollywood tries to re-create something that is already an established and popular media and ruins it in the process by changing the things that made it popular in the first place.Not here..... Sin City looks and feels like a comic come to life.Why only 4 stars you ask ?................WARNING VAGUE GENERAL SPOILER BELOW...........................................The only reason I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is the same reason I quit reading Miller's comics in the first place.In his dim "Sin City" world, the heroes rarely win the War, they only win the battles.Now I don't always want a cheery happy ending... but from time to time it would be nice to see a hero in Miller's world actually survive !

A well done movie that did not get the attention it should have.TIm Daly and Naomi Watts (how did they make her look so plain ?) do a fine job in this slightly cliched but still good story.BUT........ I must admit, I was wondering how much better this movie could have been if it was made back in Clint Eastwood's prime and the "gunslinger" recovered to be a bit more powerful and menacing than the character played by Daly.

I was surprised, but I liked this better than some of the Marvel Hero movies.Growing up, I was more of an Iron Man fan, the first film was pretty good but the 2nd Iron Man movie was horrible.I wish they had not screwed up Tony Stark's character and turned him into a sarcastic one-liner smartass instead of the troubled character he was in the comic.The Hulk movies were both pretty bad.Thor was OK.Ghost Rider was not too good.I liked the nostalgia of the 1940's Captain America.Some editing and story development seemed chopped and rushed even at over 2 hours.But they successfully integrated all the classic elements of the Captain America character.I wish there was a little less camp .... it went a bit into "cheesy" at times.This has nothing to do with the 40's time period ............ the cheese I refer to was an occasional tendency to get a little too carried away with witty humor and a "cuteness".So in the final analysis of Marvel hero films so far, I am adding the following to my DVD collection ........Iron Man # 1 (not # 2)Captain AmericaThorSpider Man # 1Not Ghost Rider, not Hulk.I don't have X-Men either. These were done Okay, but for some reason, I never was interested in X-men in comics or the movies.Not Fantastic Four.Not Daredevil

We had heard all the criticism of this film, but being lovers of 1930-1940 era stories, we decided to give it our own try.During the first 30 minutes, we were saying to ourselves.... "Hey this is really good, what is all the criticism about ?"BUT........ then it hit..... at the 31 minute mark the film hit a brick wall, fell apart and became a burden of chaotic boredom to watch.At 88 minutes we finally gave up and hit EJECT !Summary.. Excellent 40's era sets and costumes.... a great moody atmosphere.Weakness = story, pacing, character development.

Being almost 47 years old now, I can't remember the last time I watched a G-Rated movie that I enjoyed.THE FOX AND THE CHILD was a movie that I related to probably because of where my wife and I are in life.I call it coming "full circle".As a youth I grew up in a small to mid-sized town in Virginia.Whenever possible both as a kid and even as I grew up in High School or College I preferred to head out to the Mountains and Forest and spend time alone with nature as opposed to staying in the city and going to malls, nightclubs or parties.Some of my fondest memories are hiking to the top of waterfalls where I knew probably no other people were around for 6 miles and sit on a rock in the sun reading books or just watching black bear, deer and other animals.Like the child in this film, I remember 2 years that I kept running into the same few animals each Spring when I returned to the mountains.Until recently I had forgotten these old memories............. WHY ???25 years ago I moved to South Florida. I was a young man and I guess looking for a bit more excitement and job opportunities.Now I will confess, 25 years ago I thought South Florida was a tropical paradise and I would probably live there my whole life.I got into SCUBA diving, boating, beaches, the pool in the backyard , and the warm winters that make you forget Winter even exists. It's been great !But fast forward to today ..........Over the past year or two my wife and I agree something FEELS different.South Florida today does not feel like the same place we moved to 25 years ago.Yes, we all know nothing stays the same and everyplace changes ......... but the way this place has changed is Exponential.From population growth, demographic shift, traffic, urbanization, orange groves & farms eliminated and replaced with housing developments and over 240 new people PER DAY moving into the area, .................... We Came To A Sad Conclusion ....Our South Florida Is Gone !As a result, we recently purchased 120 acres of land in the Mountains up North only 60-70 miles from where we both grew up.It seems like coming full circle in life.I realize now the things we enjoy best are quiet seclusion and isolation out in nature and NOT the urbanized and mechanized world of zero lot lines, rude neighbors, light polluted night skies and a constant drone of ambient city noise.Now I know my personal story is of little interest to 99.9999% of you, but I told it only because it relates to the review of this movie.When watching this movie I started to think of how MOST kids grow up today .... Surrounded by tightly packed neighborhoods, I-PODS, Satellite TV and almost NO IDEA what nature is really like outside of TV shoes and the local park.Heck when we were kids, we ran around all day long on "Tom Sawyer - like" adventures and our parents did not know (or worry) what we were doing as long as we made it home by 6:30 for Supper.Now parents fear letting kids out of the yard for fear of pedophiles and other modern day social problems.Technological advances sure are great and wonderful -- but it does not always seem our Social, Moral and Ethical aspects of life keep progressing at an equal pace.So I watch this movie and wonder how few young people will ever understand this connection to nature in a world where the population seems to double every 10 years, it becomes harder and harder to escape Urbanization and people are forced to live on top of each other in tighter and tighter living arrangements.I can imagine a person born and raised in New York City who grew up to work on Wall Street, and with no life experiences outside the City seeing THE FOX AND THE CHILD and thinking it silly and childish.For somebody like me that has had the opportunity to live in both worlds, I found myself envious of the little girl in the film as it made me recall my earlier days.It also motivates me to work harder and faster to build a home on our recently acquired land so that I may be able to recapture some of that connection with nature I lost 23 years ago when I moved to the bigger, faster city way of life.I call it "coming full circle" and I hope I will be able to spend much of my last 20-30 years on Earth much like the story of nature depicted in this simple, well filmed, children's movie.A final note on the movie .... The ending (which I will not ruin with spoilers) teaches a lesson to younger children without being too dark and shocking.There is also a deeper symbolic meeting in the movie for adults.

This would have been OK as a made for TV movie, but it suffered from a story that was too predictable.Within the first 30 minutes you knew the ending, no surprises, no twists and it really kind of dragged along.A good movie to watch for 2 hours of entertainment, but probably nothing you will want to see again or add to your permanent DVD collection.

This could have been much better.By this I mean if you simply want a movie with several scenes of various "ways to kill/hurt you with a clever trap" storyline and you only care to see various ways to puncture skin and make blood flow, then you may really like this movie.Other than that, the silliness of it and the plodding, slow, kind of dim-witted killer do not really create much tension or suspense.Let's put it this way ... when half way thru the movie my wife comments ...... "Gee, what weenies. Why doesn't somebody just grab a steel bar or other random object and beat this $&%^$& over the head" ......... and then she absent mindedly watches the rest of the movie while she starts knitting ; you know the horror aspect is missing.It had all the right ingredients, but somehow the finished product just didn't come together convincingly.I confess, it did not hold my interest either. I started working on my laptop and only occasionally looked up during key scenes for the last 30 minutes of the film.

Man-Thing is among the weakest of the Marvel adaptions.The problem is NOT low-budget...The film had great locations and swamp settings... and the Man-Thing himself looked great (for the entire 4 minutes of screen time he got in the whole film !!).The problem that killed this movie is one that even big budget Hollywood misses today............ STORY, PLOT and PACE !!!With these 3 ingredients, a story is good even minus the special effects (look at STRAIGHT STORY, GET CARTER, DOOR TO DOOR, MY DOG SKIP, SLINGBLADE, etc..)What we get in Man-Thing is a story that almost completely ignores the origin and traits of the 1970s Marvel comic character, no clear story in regards to origins, motives, etc...ALl we get is 90 minutes of people walking around the swamp at night with flashlights looking for the infamous Man-Thing.Finally at 72 minutes we actually see the creature... we have no feelings for it or really understand it, but there it is just in time for the film to wrap up in the next 14 minutes.

We never read the original book upon which this film is based so I don't know how it compares or varies, but it started out pretty good until the Hollywood "anti-American" and "The USA is the root of all evil" subliminal suggestions started making the movie a political agenda film..........That's when we hit the eject button.I don't care to have a film try and cram a political viewpoint down my throat if it's not a documentary or paid political ad.Maybe McCarthy was on to something in the 50s..... maybe Hollywood is really filled with a bunch of unrealistic idealists who mentally live in "Candyland" and hate the very Country that affords them the ability to live as well as they do.

Although not perfect, this is one of the better and more original stabs at doing a low budget Zombie film today.Good tension scenes and a serious tone unlike the "witty and funny" zombie films that the independents seem to feel compelled to make these days.Much better than garbage like WICKEDS and FEEDING THE MASSES (these last 2 films were crap !!)

Last year we had RAMBO and this year we have TAKEN. In both cases some older guys show today's younger action heroes how it is supposed to be done.Sorry but Bourne holds no candle to Stallone and Neeson in these 2 films.But both TAKEN and RAMBO are more than just action movies... they also have a message about our world today.There is a difference between IDEALISM and REALISM and ignorance is not bliss.Especially in America today Political Correctness seems to have made a large part of our population oblivious to the fact that real evil exists in the world and has to be dealt with. Instead we have too many people turning a blind eye to so many bad trends and warning signs developing in our changing culture but they choose to stick their heads in the sand and think "everything will be OK, people are inherently good".With RAMBO it was the well intentioned missionaries who could not believe they would run into problems in Burma (But Rambo knew better).With TAKEN it is the naive, socially liberal family that thinks they can travel the world without a care (But Neeson's character knows better).In both films, our central character has to rescue our idealistic, naive victims from the harsh realities that truly exist in the world.I wonder how many viewers of these movies get the underlying message and how many only see these as tough guy action films ?

This movie was simply aggravating to watch.There was never any sympathy for the characters and in fact Moores character was simply irritating.As for the supposed surprise ending.... WHAT SURPRISE ?The whole storyline is clearly laid out in the first 10 minutes.... after that we sit thru an exaggerated backdrop of a ghetto racial tension and endless rambling from Moore's character jsut waiting for the end to some that we know is coming anyway.

My wife and I are big 24 fans and have long defended it as the best thing on TV. Even a weak season of 24 is much better than most other shows these days. Furthermore, we own all the Seasons on DVD.This will remain a classic TV series and deserves much praise for it's creativity.Having said that, all things have a lifespan and eventually come to an end.It seems that any series after 6-7 seasons begins to decline -- It can't be helped --- After 130+ episodes of ANY SHOW, what more is there to do or say ?It is kind of like life.... As we age there are fewer and fewer exciting "firsts" that we expererience and everday life becomes simple repetition of the same events with only minor variations.Season 5 was probably the last strong season.Season 6 was of course an "off-season" as most fans and viewers agree.The writer's strike seemed to kill the momentum for many shows.24 tried to bridge the gap with the African-based mini-movie filler, but that mostly fell flat for most viewers.SPOILER BELOW ....Season 7 seemed to start very good, but pretty much after the White House seige, this season seemed to just limp along with no real directon, consistency or pacing.By the time we got to the last 10 episodes, one was just hoping for the series to end and be done with it already.The 2 hour Season Finale may in fact be the worst and weakest single 24 episode ever as it was totally out of character, stiff, and apparently FOX felt some need to start shoving more and more political correctness into the show this season that went beyond neccessity.Will we watch next season ......... hmmm, Yes.BUT........ if Season 8 continues going in the direction that Season 7 ended, we may very well drop off and stop watching.This is not a nasty critique of 24 at all ........ as I said at the beginning, we have loved the show --------- but there comes a time for EVERYTHING (Cheers, Seinfeld, Wings, etc..etc..etc..)24 was a GREAT, GREAT show .......it's just that it feels as though it's time has come to end.UPDATE -Over the Memorial Day weekend we received Season 7 DVD in the mail and decided to watch it straight thru for a re-evaluation.I feel the need to update my earlier review.OVERALL, Season 7 was better than I remembered. I think my earlier tough rating was skewed by the most recently aired (final 5-6 episodes).I still feel the Season "fell apart" at the end and seemed to wander aimlessly and lose it's way at the very end.Watching Season 7 again non-stop two (2) things become apparent...(1) It seems that perhaps 10-12 episodes were filmed BEFORE the strike in Hollywood. I say this because the feel and vibe of the writing changes erratically around the 11th episode as though the writers and cast had been on a long break and had a hard time getting back in the vibe.(2) Depite item #1, the Season was really pretty good overall.... but something just derailed during the last 5-6 episodes and as mentioned before, I still feel the final episode was like a car with a blown engine just rolling to a stop.The feeling during the last 5-6 episodes is almost as though the writers ran out of story but realized they had another 6-7 hours to fill so they started "running out the clock" to fill the time void.All things considered, I feel my rating should be UPGRADED to a Four (4).

With this MI movie, all similarity to the original series has been offically lost.Sure the effects were 5 star rating.But the basic story and plot was a 0-1.In this movie, the MI crew basically find the hard and complex way to do simple things like grab a large scale arms dealer.Of course the movie loses 1-2 stars right off the bat for the simple reason that WE HATE MOVIES THAT SHOW THE ENDING FIRST, then flash back to show you how things led up to this conclusion...... HATE THAT !!!!Often we just eject movies at that point....after all... who cares about the steps along the way once you know the conclusion.This movie could have been a 3rd installment of the Bourne Identity and nobody would have known the difference as it does not have the "Mission Impossible feel" at all.Fair entertainment but quickly forgetable

This happens time and time again.........WHY DOES HOLLYWOOD MAKE DARK CHARACTERS AND STORIES GOOFY, CAMPY AND SILLY ?There is a logic flaw somewhere with Hollywood quite often when it comes to comic characters or legends that eludes me.........They take a dark character and turn it into a goofy spoof of itself with some generic "Hollywood formula" that usually damages the film with fans and loses the general audience because it changes the character that was apparently successful enough in the first place to be worthy of a movie.Consider for a moment with comic heroes........You have the comic fanbase who know the character and will be dissapointed if you tamper with it.Then you have the general public who knows little about the character and thus have no preconceived expectations.SO....If you make the character faithful to the comic, the fans will praise it and the general public who have no other expectation will love it also.Instead when Hollywood turns a character like Ghost Rider into a campy pale shadow of itself, the fans are turned off and the general public are left wondering... "Why is this character so popular" ?The end result ?Bad box office returns and the quick kill of a franchise before it can get started.Ghost Rider STARTED right on track, but once Cage entered and started his one-liner "Comedy Central" cracks and quirky sarcasm, the movie eroded quickly.Then try and forget the inconsistencies in story logic or even why an evil spawn with the power of Satan himself is affected by shotgun bullets, etc...The writers seemed to confuse Ghost Rider with the Hulk also........... Ghost Rider (original comic series) was articulate and spoke like a demon with long sermon like preachings when inflicting his wrath............. this movie version of Ghost Rider grunts and utters Hulk-like sentences like........ "Ahhhhh You Guilty"The effects department deserves great accolades for a fine job.They did their part to make a 5 star film.But that is a problem we see alot these days................ films focus on the effects but ignore the stories and character development.Is the General Public getting that dumbed down today -or- am I just getting to old ?People are razzle-dazzled by the eye candy and just ignore stories ?

MACHINIST is one of those pure art films that the makers must have known would be seen by very few people when they were making it, but they made it out of love of the film media and acting for it's own sake.The movie is great at what it is, but not something you will probably add to your DVD collection or watch more than once.I don't know to be impressed with Bale for having the discipline to starve himself to such a degree -or- question his sanity as an actor who apparently gets totally immersed in his roles.His physical transformation must have been a personal challenge for himself since the budget on this film could not possibly have made it finanically tempting to starve himself to the point of looking like a Holocaust survivor.

Okay, the film is not 100% faithful to Bradbury's story.. and like many lower budget films older CGI effects are all that can be afforded, but a film should not be graded for simple effects...but for STORY.The plot was tampered with enough to make the film less than perfect, BUT compared to the higher budgeted crap that Hollywood has passed off as sci-fi in the recent past, this was an enjoyable movie.

As everybody knows by now, Disturbia was pretty much a modernized remake of Hitchcocks 'Rear Window" for the teen scene.For all practical purposes nothing of substance happens for the first 50 minutes of the this film, thus suspense is never really built like in Hitchcock's work.When things start to happen, it does so in a largely irritating manner due to the two (2) criminal sins too many film makers commit today........1) Keeping the story going by having everybody do the dumbest actions possible.2) Ignore the laws of physics and reality.MILD SPOILER ALERT BELOW........................................If you are watching a murderer thru binoculars from across the street and the very moment you set them down, you turn and find that killer standing in your 2nd floor bedroom then somehow that killer is either magical or owns a molecular transporter.All thru this movie, the killer appears and dissapears instantaneously near our main characters even if they just saw the killer 100 yards away only 2 seconds earlier.I suppose this was done to "surprise" the audience, but it comes across quite silly.The young actors were actually very good and they could have done more with this movie........ it ends up just being a watered down teen flick that borrows heavily from a classic but misses the formula for what made the original Hitchcock film so good.

I give Season 4 of "24" four stars not rated relative to it's own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, "24" is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it's worse, "24" is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc..

I will keep this short...My wife and I gave up on the movie after 40 minutes and hit EJECT. We simply could not get into the story or stop laughing anytime BATMAN would talk in that strange digitally altered voice they tried to use.I am an old comics collector and love the whole Superhero universe but I don't see the cause for excitement over this movie. Pretty flat.BUT THE BIGGEST IRRITATION that most likely contributed to us not finishing the movie was the annoying sound and audio levels.We had to watch the movie with the REMOTE in hand because dialoque was almost impossible to hear yet sound effects, music and other audio effects were vibrating and overloading our speakers.The entire time watching the film was like a video game with the thumb RIDING THE VOLUME KNOB up and down and up and down, etc..Horrible.... sound and audio mixing that ruined the potential enjoyment of the film.

I used to own a copy of this book back in the 70s and I remembered it as being some dark, secret handbook of recipes and anarchy.Somewhere over the years I lost my copy and had totally forgotten about it.But at a recent gun show I saw copies for sale and being at the age where I am starting to get nostalgic for what I consider a "better time" (meaning the 70s and 80s), I picked up a copy to recapture some lost youth I suppose.Oh my... how 30 years can change ones perception.This book is interesting to read for its historical snapshot of late 60's drug induced hippy era idealism and anti-establishment rebellion, but otherwise THIS IS PRETTY DARNED FUNNY !!!!As a degreed Chemist myself, I will say that maybe 30% of the formulas will actually work IF (and I stress IF) you don't kill yourself first because of the inherent dangers and lack of safety instructions. The other 70% of the formulas are pretty much rubbish.As for the drawings and schematics for booby trap devices they are less detailed and about as useful as the pictures you see Wiley Coyote reading on a Road Runner cartoon.Finally the forward by Peter Bergmann is so off the mark and now proven wrong by history that it dates the book horribly -- but as I said earlier also makes it a fun "snapshot of late 60s- early 70s" mentality among the youth culture.It's a cute little relic and piece of "dark literature" from a simpler more innocent time in America --- but for those of you truly seeking to form your own world order, overthrow the government and let Anarchy run wild, you may want to look elsewhere for your motivation and education.SMILEI think it is VERY important to note that the original author of the Anarchist Cookbook has reportedly discredited this book publically and expressed his wishes that the book no longer be printed.His reasons being that he wrote it when he was only a teenager and was expressing outrage and anger at the Vietnam War in the best way he knew how at that young age with so much pain and violence around him.As with all of us who think we knew everything when we were 17 or 18 years old ------- WISDOM COMES WITH AGE AND EXPERIENCE. Mr. Powell has indicated he no longer supports the ideas expressed in this book and wishes it would dissapear so that hopefully no impressionable minds are influenced by it.I respect him for that position.

The studio took a big risk with this film.They have basically abandoned the slap-stick comedy that has plagued Bond for 2 decades and created a very close and accurate portrayal of James Bond as written in the original novels from the 50s.These stories were dark, gritty and serious in tone.Of course it is safe to say that probably 95%+ of Bond fans only know James Bond from the movies, thus THEY may think this movie is off base for the character when it is actually the closest we have seen since 1962's "DR NO" when Sean Connery played a more serious Bond in the firt film.I know this is true because many critics of the film have attacked it for being very "un-Bond-like" when in fact it is almost dead on.Okay... the criticisms...1)Since this film is intended to explain how Bond earned his Double-0 license to kill, it theoretically of course pre-dates DR NO.This presents a problem for the nit-picky "Bond World Historians" since Bond's first boss "M" was a man.Also Daniel Craig appears a bit older than Sean Connery was in the first film.2) About Daniel Craig... His acting and dedication to playing this part wins you over out of respect.... BUT............. James Bond is supposed to have a "dark and cruel look".Okay.... with that stare, Craig has the cruel part down, but why couldn't they have darkened his hair a bit to at least visually match the Fleming description of Bond since they did everything else so accurately ?In the end, as I said above Daniel Craig earns your respect with his acting ability (I was NOT originally happy to hear he won the role.... I was hoping for somebody like the dark haired actor from SIN CITY---forgot his name right now).But Craig does capture the personality of the "Fleming Novel Version of Bond", even if the physical appearance is slightly off.Sidenote: I have always seen Craig as a villian for some reason, not a good guy..... but again I repeat..... he earned my respect to the point I accept him in the role.I hope they keep him on a serious side though, I don't want him to start throwing out one-liner comedy in the future.Since I am a Bond fan for over 30+ years, I for one was happy to see the studio scrap the silly humor, the "Bond Formula" that was being used in almost everyone of the last 10+ films, and the overemphasis on special effects and stunts simply for the sale of "eye candy".Finally we have a more gritty, dark and dangerous spy-vs-spy world with a tough Bond and not pretty boys grinning and smiling as they toss out one-liners like they know their lives are never in any real danger.I think the success of "24" on Fox and The Bourne Identity taught the studios a lesson..... people want the serious spy stories again and NOT the comical romps and frolics thru over-the-top CGI-land with bad guys that look like they came out of a Marvel Comic Book.Bond is Back !I hope the general viewing public is sharp enough to know or educate themselves on some Bond/Fleming history to appeciate this film for what it is.

As an episode of American Justice with Bill Curtis on TV, this would have proven very good.After all, one of the worst things any of us can imagine is being wrongly imprisoned for something we really did not do.Documentaries that make us aware of this problem and how to improve accuracy of convictions with new technology is a good service.So why was this bad as a movie ?Perhaps it is our knowledge of the activism that people like Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover are often involved in that makes this feel less like a serious portrayal of these stories and more like the audience is being preached at.As an episode of Bill Curtis - American Justice, it would have been good.As a movie staged to look and feel like the stage play it was based on, this simply did not work as a movie.

It is always dissapointing to see what COULD have been a great film go down in flames....I have never read the Cussler novel so can only view the film on its own merit.The opening scenes in Richmond looked like this would be a great film........ then........UGHHHHHH it got real bad real fast.3 major problems....1) Penelope CruzShe is simply horrible and annoying in anything she does.2) Too much stupid humorWill Hollywood EVER make a straight adventure film again without it seeming like a big comedy romp ?It is so old seeing the straight guy and the goofy sidekick overdone once again.3) A soundtrack of classic songs which unfortunatley did not match the film at all !As a serious adventure this would have been a great 4-5 stars.... as it is, it was a bad waste of effort, ruined mostly do to it's overdone silliness and casting of the terrible Penelope Cruz.

HOUSE OF WAX 2005 could have been a great film..... it took the idea of the original House of Wax classic one step further... the sets were great.... the atmosphere was great... the props were great... the effects were great.........So why do I say... "What a Shame" ??It's a shame to see all the great things I mentioned above WASTED on the overused, predictable and pathetic horror storyline Hollywood seems stuck with these days.I have now made a promise to myself, that I will NEVER AGAIN pick up any movie that starts with a description like..... "6 teenagers out for a night of fun get lost in the wilderness near a deserted town....."I am FED UP with horror movies that always seems to revolve around six (usually silly or stupid) teenagers who get themseleves into trouble.In the case of HOUSE OF WAX, most of the cast were such irritating characters you actually HOPED they would get killed off early in the movie so that possibly some other group of charaters were the ones who would actually find their way to the House of Wax.Only Elisha Cuthbert was a well done character and stood out among the rest.If this movie had used all the great sets, effects, props and atmosphere with a more serious tone and "non-formulaic" storyline, it could have been a great film...... instead we get a twist on Scream, Blair Witch, and countless others of these films that always start with the premise..."6 kids on a camping trip find out they are not alone..."6 kids on a road trip get lost in a strange town...""6 kids take a drive to a lake, not suspecting what awaits them...""6 kids decide to have a party in an abandoned house.. but are they really alone ?...""6 kids decide to camp out in a graveyard for a dare.. but do the dead really sleep ?"etc....etc.....etc...etc..etc....etc...PLEASE Hollywood.... STOP making these "a group of stupid teens get themselves in trouble" type Horror movies and do something new and creative instead of letting all this potential be wasted.One last curious sidenote.... The kids are driving cars with FLORIDA plates, yet the House of Wax (literally a House of Wax in this film) seems to hold up quite well in that hot Florida Sunlight...hmmmmmm

Any movie that relies on a single "punchline" or a "One trick pony" for a full 2 hours usually wears thin and this is no exception.By about 55 minutes my wife and I were saying to each other..... "OK, this has gotten old already".I have to admit though we liked Brad Pitt in this movie which was surprising since we have never thought much of anything he has done since Interview with a Vampire.He is one of those popular actord who you always wonder why he is such a press magnet since most of his films have been medicore.

With twice the budget, this movie is only half as good as the original Resident Evil.The problem ?Resident Evil like most "Zombie"-related films get their appeal from the feeling of dread derived by being pursued relentlessly by massive hordes of living dead.In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we get about 8 minutes of zombies at the beginning and 2 minutes at the end.The rest of the movie revolves around our band of heroes fighting the Umbrella Corp. Security Team.Call it "Matrix Meets Resident Evil".Not as entertaining as the first by any means.

I AM LEGEND could have been a classic film.But it fell flat.... a terrible loss of potential.First the good....1) The scenery work making New York look like a wasteland deserves an oscar. Very well done.2) Will Smith has matured into a very good actor and did well in this film.3) The film borrowed heavily from the Vincent Price film version of this sci-fi classic which is a good thing.Now the BAD..........1) CGI "dark seekers".Hollywood needs to put away the "gee-whiz" gimmickery and sometimes focus on real film making again.These cartoon-looking "monsters" looked so goofy and like the Zombies in the old SEGA video game "House of the Dead" that any feeling of dread and gloom that were established by the great scenery was lost.CGI is still not to the level technologically where it can be used for humans or characters meant to strike a chord of reality or feeling.That's what killed the HULK, recent remake of KING KONG and some other recent films.You simply can't connect or feel "what I am seeing is real" when they are visually divorced from reality.Smith's other film "I-ROBOT" suffered that same problem.2) SPOILER ALERT -.....................When Sam, the dog dies...... so does the apparent pacing of the movie.Others have had the same comment on here.... It seems the 2nd half of the movie pales in comparison to the first.The plot device used to get rid of Sam, was too contrived.ie.... Smith's character get's snared in a trap.Then awakens just at sunset.When he gets down... you ask yourself ............... Okay Buddy why don't you hop on your one good leg ??But NO.... he drags across the ground until the dark seekers come out and attack them.... THEN afterwards of course when the damage is done, he is able to limp on that same leg and even carry Sam.My wife kept complaining.... "Great the dog dies because he is too stupid to hop on his one good leg and get out of there. They should have re-shot that scene differently".In summary it seems they had the budget to work with, but somehow the film fell FLAT and was OK..... but it is not memorable and will probably be forgotten with time.Even allowing for it's old age.... We feel the 1956 Vincent Price version of this film "Last Man On Earth" actually had a stronger feeling of pathos than this remake.But this new film COULD have been a classic if they maintained the mood of the first 40 minutes and did not turn the movie into a CGI fun-festPS...The ALTERNATE ENDING is FAR SUPERIOR to the theatrical "Happy Hollywood" ending and while not identical to the message of the novel, does both capture the general message best and also matches the mood of the rest of the film.The theatrical ending really weakened the film and seems like a mismatch tacked on at the end.The "alternate ending" alone boosts the rating of this film 1-2 stars.

I heard it said the makers of this movie were inspired by the success of SHAWN OF THE DEAD.Uhhmmmm ....... well......... they should have looked for more inspirationWhile SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent and sets the 5 Star Standard for a Zombie Spoof movie, this movie (Zombieland) shows glimpses of potential but falters and instead relies on too much simple stupidity to try and be funny.It fails to have the kind of creative wit and dark humor that made SHAWN OF THE DEAD so good.If you like people breaking things, cursing as much as possible and simply acting stupid you might like Zombieland ...... but if you only have enough time in life to see one Zombie-spoof movie, then watch SHAWN OF THE DEAD instead.

We hated to see such great actors in this annoyingly filmed and absurd story....... based on a "true story".Well thats a weak use of the English Language since the Bell Ghost of Tennessee "legend" is yet another of those urban myths that has pretty much been determined to be yet another hoax of history like the Ammityville house and scores of other "true haunting" stories.Even as fiction it is repetitive and annoying with the "flying demon POV" angles that become comical more than haunting.

As we all know the original RING was a remake of a Japanese film...and was pretty good.... (much better than the GRUDGE, which was also a Japanese film converted to USA film, but was lame).RING 2 feels like a Hollywood film thru and thru... or more exactly it feels like a "made for TV movie"............. slow, plodding and beyond boring.Simply put, RING 2 has big continuity holes and departures from the principles established in the original........... moves at a painfully plodding pace, and has ZERO moments of chills, suspense or anything for that matter.The tell-tale sign Hollywood was behind this movie are the moments of comic relief (Deers attacking the car and the Realtor).... oddly enough I don't think those were MEANT to be humor, but they were.The RING 2 is simply a snore and a bore no matter how you look at it.

Mean Creek is very much like that Stephen King film starring River Pheonix from some years back (name escapes me now), but has a very REALISTIC feel to it.Like all good films, you can forget you are watching a movie.I would have given it 5 stars but something happens at the ending as though they had to edit part of it or were trying to stay under a certain length because after a great build-up the end just simply ENDS without full development.But that is the only complaint for an otherwise well done movie.A LESSON HOLLYWOOD......... good stories don't need special effects and you can't make a lousy story interesting with $60Million worth of CGI graphics.Some of the best films of the last few years have been void of excessive "eye candy".

These Blackstone audio books are EXCELLENT readings of Ian Fleming's James Bond series.Like many people, I was first exposed to James Bond thru the Sean Connery movies.But as I got into my teens I was curious about the "real" James Bond and read all the Ian Fleming novels.I remember thinking the books were "cooler" than the movies in many ways.They had a dark, melancholy tone that the slightly comical action movies lost over time.The Fleming Bond differs quite a bit from the cinema Bond, with Daniel Craig actually being the closest to Fleming's Bond in the Casino Royale movie.Now almost 30 years later, I decided to get all the Bond books on AudioBooks and listen to them while I take long drives.It is funny how we see things a little different with age.At age 47, I can still say that Ian Fleming paints a very vivid visual image of the scenes he describes with his eloquent writing style.But now with maturity I can more clearly see some of the weak logic in some of Bond's missions ...For example ...In LIVE AND LET DIE, James Bond is sent after Mr. Big.Question - How smart would it be to send a white British agent into a 1950's Harlem district to hunt down a black crime boss ?Hardly a good "undercover" or "top secret" mission.Bond would stand out like Rush Limbaugh at a Democratic convention.Also in LIVE AND LET DIE, there is a lot of travel from New York to Florida to Jamaica but little real NEED for these travels.These trips serve largely as an excuse for Fleming to go into long descriptions of locations and foods that Bond experiences along the way.Fleming's description of tropical sea life is a bit overblown with Bond even being enveloped by an Octopus in 15 feet of water near a Coral Reef in Jamaica.Hmmmm ... I have been SCUBA diving since 1977 in the tropics and logged over 1300 hours underwater and have yet to experience 1/10th the dangers 007 faced on this mission.In the end, I still love Ian Fleming's James Bond --- but now I have to take some of the plots with a grain of salt and not take them too seriously.After all ... in LIVE AND LET DIE, the only real objective seems to be to kill Mr. Big and stop his coin smuggling operation that is feeding working capital to SMERSH.Would they really have a British agent come to the USA to do this, or would the CIA simply handle the matter themselves directly without all the traveling and fancy dinners ?

A word to all Hollywood directors, editors and producers....... STOP USING THAT IRRITATING CHOP MOTION DIGITAL EDITING FOR ACTION SCENES !!!!The new Dawn of the Dead remake started PERFECTLY with an opening that casts the proper sense of doom and rapidly escalating chaos.At this point I was thinking... WOW finally a remake that is great and in some ways may even surpass the original.Then as the film progresses, the inclusion of too many characters weakens the development and the movie begins to have a dragging feel that lessens your real interest or empathy for their plight.However, the REAL thing that killed my enjoyment for this film was the last 1/3 of the movie where the final action and resolution starts kicking into motion.The makers of the film chose to film this entire last 30% of the movie in that same irritating grainy, pixelated, choppy, skip frame, digital editing that I first remember seeing used in GLADIATOR'S opening battle scene.Since GLADIATOR this style of action film editing seems to have become the trend for editors and directors to use.It is supposed to introduce tension and energy but instead many people like myself find that instead it DETRACTS from the film as you really can't follow the action and it imparts a fake look to scenes.When you use it non-stop for 30 minutes or so like in DAWN OF THE DEAD's final scenes it becomes downright annoying and removes any feelings of terror or suspense that had been developed in the earlier portion of the film.Standard speed filming would have greatly improved the overall movie.Attention Hollywood..... drop the choppy digital action editing trend..... it's not an effective visual tool..... just visually annoying to try and watch !!!

One never likes to really criticize a creative work because it is difficult to create a song, or movie or other creative object.On the other hand it is easy to be a critic.BUT sometimes something is so bad you feel obligated to warn people away.This movie deserves such a warning.It looks like the kind of movies we used to make with our home 8mm film cameras in the 70s just for fun.Terrible film qualityBad lightingBad soundBad scriptBad actingIt is like a group of friends got together one day with no advance planning and said "lets just improvise on the spot and make a movie today. We will make it up as we go along".Horrible in all aspects.

I really , really tried to watch this movie, but I just could not stand to watch much of it.I found it annoying to try and watch.Now that I am older, I appreciate movies about life's experiences ....films like THE STRAIGHT STORY, DOOR TO DOOR, etc ...But somehow this movie seemed to abstract, incohesive and "artsy"It felt like well framed scenes pasted together in random fashion but the sum of the parts ended up less than the whole.Rather than get pulled in and compelled to watch, it was more of an effort to watch to the point it simply was not worth the effort -------- no care or concern for the characters at all.After a few attempts, I simply could not tolerate more than 30 minutes of it.The 2 people watching it with me were of the same opinion.Beautifully filmed scenes, but it just never came together as a compelling story.The background DRONING monotone music and heavy repetitive pedal points also were annoying

As a fan of both Sci-fi and pulps from the 1930s & 1940s, I was delighted by Sky Captain.Jude Law was probably not the most "authentic" choice for the types of heros in serials and pulps back then (think DOC SAVAGE and the SHADOW, FLASH GORDEN, etc...).. but did an OK job.The 99% CGI generated world with the Art Deco feel and atmosphere and color filters are fun.Like the Serials and Pulps of the era, the plot is kept simple, the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad... the action is the main theme.Basically SKY CAPTAIN is not to be taken too serious.... it is basically a comic book, Amazing Stories Sci-FI mag and/or a Golden Era Pulp from the 30-40s brought to life.For that I like it.

This was pretty good film.It is easy to see alot of work went into it....BUT... something just does not "click"....and I don't know exactly what it is.It almost feels like everybody is walking thru the scenes as visualized in the storyboards, but in a "mechanical" sort of way if that makes any sense.Unlike some DVDs you eiher want to buy and add to your collection, or at least talk/think about afterwards... X-Men 3 came across as 110 minutes of good entertainment that you forget about as soon as it goes back in the Blockbuster rental case.

Obviouly the CHUCKY series is not expected to be "great cinema".. but over the years it has proven very entertaining.In fact, BRIDE OF CHUCKY was a highpoint of camp, macabre humor and some slashing !!However, SEED OF CHUCKY is pure crap !Soap Opera storylines, too many jokes centered around bodily functions, etc...By the way.... is there a reason the "child" doll looks like David Bowie ?I suppose with the homage to Glen or Glenda, Psycho, Shining, etc... is was only appropriate to use the best known british accented androgenous character as a model.Not worthy of the CHUCKY name..... if the writing has dropped to this level, it' time for the Chucky series to end.

This film disgusted me when I saw it BEFORE 9/11 and disgusts me even more now as it is an obvious "Hollywood Agenda" movie trying to push this idealistic political view of "love the enemy trying to kill you fueled by their insane views and hatred of their own existence".With Annette Bening in it , is it any surprise this is a HEAVILY BIASED view of how to handle problems in today's world by avoiding to confront them and cover our eyes and ears to harsh realities.Hopefully the real events of September 11, 2001 will prove how ignorant and misguided this film was in its presentations and viewpoints !

I first read the Fleming Bond novels 25 years ago and found them better than most of the movies.Now I am revisiting Bond again by listening to them on Audio CD while driving.After listening to DR NO, LIVE AND LET DIE, the various short stories, it started to dawn on me ............What was Fleming's fascination with Octopi ?It seems every time James Bond goes underwater he is grabbed or otherwise fighting with an Octopus.Now I have been living and diving in the Carribean and Florida Keys for 30 years,You just don't see Octopus all that often and certainly not ones that attack you, try to grab you and pull you into caves, etc....This is a minor criticism of otherwise wonderfully written stories, but it is sort of strange the way Fleming seems to be obsessed with this 8 legged sea creature.

I can't say I support Bush on all his policies by any means... BUT... if you are going to criticize people at least be sure you do it based on actual facts and not just emotional or media-generated "bandwagon" frenzy.The problem with this documentary is kind of like doing a research study but only revealing the test results that support your view and tossing away the other results that cast doubts on your research.In this documentary, the producers try to keep hammering the message home that "Bush lied about the threat of Iraq. There were no Weapons of Mass Destruction, etc...."The problem with this often use criticism, is it assumes the American public is either stupid or has no memory.A quick review of video and news archives show Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore and other leading Democrats giving speeches as far back as 1999 criticizing Bush Senior for not being more forceful on dealing with Iraq and how the administration must be faulted for not dealing with the "growing threat of Saddam Hussein and his nuclear weapons program".In other words, it is clearly documented that virtually every politician on both sides was warning that the USA had to forcefully deal with Iraq long before Sept 2001.Now in hindsight, when an American President does in fact take that action and it goes screwy because of too much political correctness and a lack of devotion to hit HARD, FAST and ALL-ENCOMPASSING in a warlike manner ............. all these same politicians are hoping a short-minded American public will forget their call to arms 8-9 years ago and allow them to distance themselves from the responsibility today.Even sites like YOUTUBE for example, have some of the old news clips of Gore and Clinton banging their fists saying we need to stop Saddam growing threat of nuclear weapons and WMDs.What hypocricy.Now I am not defending Bush.... After his insane AMNESTY TO ILLEGALS ide this past month, he can fend for himself..............BUT.......For anybody, Republican or Democrat I simply say....Criticize based on reality and facts, and not just jump on a popular media led hate campaign and become one of their mindless followers or cattle.

I think DIO is among the greatest rock/metal vocalists of all time.I really like most of his albums -- but something is missing with MASTER OF THE MOON.It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but it just feels like there is no energy on this album.It plods along with very sparse instrumentation. Most songs are a simple mid-tempo chugging 8th notes and a basic drum pattern ... and when the CD is finished, none of the songs are really memorable in your mind.It is not bad ... it simply is kind of "there" if that makes any sense.DIO is great and most of his material are great, but this CD and MAGICA are probably his weakest 2 releases.

As everybody knows by now, SUPER 8 was kind of a homage to Spielberg film by Abrams,At the beginning, I was liking it much more than I expected and was really enjoying the 70's era vintage vibe and the story of young kids ................. BUT ............... as the movie went along it became clear it was TOO CLOSE to being a thinly disguised remake of E.T.This became less of a homage and more of a "by the numbers" plot re-work bordering on a flagrant remake with a slightly darker tone.Up until the 50 minute mark, I felt SUPER 8 was going to be a 4.5- 5.0 star movie, but from about 55 minutes onwards it started to fall apart and fade and lost its charm and became basically gave up trying to even disguise the fact it was remaking E.T.As with most critics of the film, the last 10 minutes (ENDING) was very weak and falls flat compared to the rest of the the film.The kid actors (and other actors) did a great job.The set and wardrobe people did a great job.As mentioned above ...... for the first 2/3 of the movie, it was on track to be almost a 5 star rating ............. but then it became TOO FORMULAIC and predictable and seemed TOO CLOSE to E.T. and many other similar movies.Also the last 1/3 of the movie is where the plot holes became very obvious and the logic of the plot falls apart with inconsistencies.Entertaining to watch and much respect for those who worked on the film, but not one we will add to our DVD collection or ever watch again in the future.

To me there are two (2) Steve Vais...There is the Steve Vai we hear on more traditional rock type projects like "Juice", "The Audience is Listening", work with David Lee Roth, "Yankee Rose", "Tobacco Road", Whitesnake, movie Crossroads, etc..etc..Then there is the Steve Vai who was heavily influenced by Zappa and other "jazzy/fusion" like artists."Little Green Men", "Catch the Man with the Ball", "Ya-yo Gak", etc..After giving away 1/2 of my Steve Vai albums after I buy them, I have finally come to the realization that I am not a big fan of Vai's more "out there" material with the weird sound effects, and other goofy "Little Green Men" type of material.Do not get me wrong... Steve is EXTEMELY talented and a Master of what he does..... but much of his stranger material is an acquired taste.To me it is sort of like free form Jazz.... you have all the respect in the world for the people's music skills yet 10 minutes after listening to them play you can't remember anything you heard nor do you have a strong desire to listen to it again.There is no "hook".For me this Vai album fits into that "more out there" style of experimentation and sound effects that Vai often leans towards.After 2 listens, I gave it away the same day I received it.It is the work of a master musician and guitarist, but not something that "hooks" me and makes me want to listen again and again.If you like Vai the "rocker", you may be like me and find this album complex, masterful and worthy of respect but unappealing for repeated listening enjoyment.On the otherhand if you like the weird sounds, heavy lydian and related modal playing, harmonized and synthetic guitar tone and the "Zappa-like" weirdness of much of Steve's work.... you will LOVE this album.Again I must stress, one can't honestly criticize Steve Vai's ability... he is a true master at what he does much like Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, etc...It is simply a matter of taste and what "grabs" you and makes you come back to an album time and time again.Some people love Mozart but find Bach boring.Considering the guitarists mentioned above (Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai) for example...Each is a master of a different trademark style, but I find myself listening to Gilbert and Malmsteen more often than many of Vai's albums.The exception being "Passion & Warfare" and Steve's work with Roth/Whitesnake.

Basically MAN ON FIRE was pretty good.Not quite what I expected from previews (pacing was a bit flat).... but much better than alot of garbage released these days.My biggest complaint ?This film had some of the worst cinematography, lighting, camera angles and editing of any film I have seen this side of low budget camcorder-shot B-films.The camera work, visuals and lighting made the film a bit annoying to watch and detracted from the film's overall impact.

A remake is a tough thing to consider....Does one stay faithful to the original -or- try to revamp the film with something new to offer ?There is another important thing to consider, SOME FILMS DON'T NEED A REMAKE!The OMEN like PSYCHO is one of those films that can stand on it's own and had no need for a remake (like Led Zepplin's STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN).There is NOTHING a studio could do to win in this situation, although it appears they did make $$$ on this clunker.And of course we all understand film making is a business first and art second.However, all that aside, this remake of OMEN got off to a bad start with poor casting, bland performances and basically came across as FLAT.It almost seems the whole crew from actors to director were almost embarassed and ashamed to be remaking this film.It just gave that feeling when watching it.I was almost tempted to pull out the original and watch them side-by-side at the same time because unless I am mistaken the dialoge and scenes seem IDENTICAL as thought the exact 1970s shooting script was used for this remake.Watching this DVD (before we ejected it about 60 minutes in) was like looking at a polaroid picture of a beautiful woman as compared to having the real thing standing inches in front of you.The remake was just flat and lifeless.It would be more fun to see Hollywood do remakes of movies that had potential the first time, but failed.... to see if they can rework them and make a better film the second time.1975's DOC SAVAGE comes to mind.It was an early version of what Indiana Jones later became and SHOULD have been good since it was based on a popular 1930's pulp here.Instead the film was campy and died at the box office.It would be good for example to see a film like that done properly.

It is rare that a sequel can live up to the original.. especially when the original was a classic... but Psycho 2 brings back Norman Bates with a witty and extremely entertaining way.Perkins really develops Bates into the "psycho killer you root for" in this film.Amazing that a film wil a low $5 mill budget like this can be so much more captivating that the disposal $200 Mill budget films Hollywood is spitting out today !

When compared to the majority of films being released these days, HOSTAGE is about as good as it gets making this type of film...Classic good honest cop thrown into a tough situation while trying to escape the burnout of a prior life is faced with some of society's worst criminals and human scum !Bruce Willis does some of his best dramatic emotional acting in this tense hostage thriller.Soundtrack helps build the moods and tensions.This is not the mindless "cotton candy" formula fluff liberal Hollywood tends to toss out these days.. this is a real story with real world grit.Sure there are some minor elements I may not have been 100% thrilled with regarding the kid's pat of the storyline, but no film can be 100% perfect in every regard for every viewer.Like I said, this is about as good as it gets when making this type of film.It's a shame it got such little attention when other lesser films are better known.

An entertaining 94 minutes of "who done it" intrigue.Was good to see Sean Young again.C. Thomas Howell looked a bit ragged.... is his health OK ?Admittedly we guessed the plot and the killer at around 30 minutes into the movie and at times the plot twists made us think we might be wrong.... but we were right.Despite figuring it out so early, it was still entertaining

The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a classic largely because it was somewhat original, unique and shocking when it was first released 25 years or ao ago.. much like the original Dawn of the Dead ushered in Zombies, TCM introduced us to the modern concept of horror/slasher films.Of course over the years, hundreds if not thousands of horror films have been made all borrowing from the TCM idea.So what is wrong with this new remake ?It's 25 years too late.If this had been the movie we saw all those years ago it may be something special but as it exists now in 2003/2004 it sinks into the sludge pile of being just another &quot;dumb stupid teens meet Deliverance type country people&quot; film.All these movies share a common trait (although nowadays the teens are usually at some cottage in the woods 90% of the time)......... the teens are always so stupid you don't care about them and actually are kind of glad to see them get killed.Think about it... if you need to escape danger from a house... how hard is it really ?These dumb kids keep running in circles around the house so they keep running headlong into leatherface and family.Worse yet they toss in a little &quot;tribute&quot; to Blair Witch Project at the end of this movie.... UGHHH.... Blair Witch... that's a whole other story in terms of junky over-rated movies.

After finally renting SKYLINE I see what all the criticism was about.It is a shame because you can see much work went into making the film, but it simply NEVER finds itself.Despite the subject matter, there is never any suspense built, never any feeling of impending doom, never any concern for the characters, nothing, nothing, nothing .......The only feeling the movie gave us was ....1) Will it be over soon ?2) How many ways are they going to try and remake War of The Worlds in my lifetime ?This is one of the few times I must say a movie is NOT worth the time to sit thru.

Un-watchable is the only word that comes to mind.My wife and I started to watch this movie. After 30 minutes we looked at each other and agreed neither found it interesting.But in all fairness, we told ourselves maybe we were not in the right frame of mind and decided to try it again 2 weeks later.40 minutes into the movie we again agreed not only did it not grab our interest .... it actually discouraged us to watch it.I can't place my finger on it but the film was actually annoying to try and watch .... like a big effort.Everything seemed stiff and forced as though a movie was being made under duress.Very odd.

If you ever doubted Hollywood was filled with naive, idealistic, socialist liberals who believe big business, gun manufacturers and large corporations and Republicans are EVIL forces terrorizing the world, then see this movie.....Geeezzzz what a pathetic and shallow excuse for a movie that does nothing more than make villians of the entities I list above.When the anti-gun crusaders finally win their way and guns are banned, people will start using other weapons to carry out their evil intentions.Maybe even tools like screwdrivers.The what will happen ???Just because a select few decide to misuse a product, will that be outlawed too ?Bye Bye Stanley tools.... we can't let you own a screwdriver or hammer because somebody COULD use it to commit murder.Regardless of the weapon used... it is the HUMAN in control of it that is at fault.That is where strict punishment SHOULD be applied in our ever-softening and weak society.This movie does do a good job though of demonstrating how we should probably consider the concept of &quot;Professionally Trained Jurors&quot; who are randomly selected by computer to hear cases and pass verdicts instead of they way we do it today.The current jury system is a sad excuse for justice.With professional jurors you would have people that actually understand law, are trained to think logically and could lose their business licence and livelyhood if they are found to be in cahoots with either of the legal teams !

Ignore the critics here on Amazon.This is a cool and much improved remake of the 1971 GET CARTER.Brief synopsis...."Bad brother" and occupational debt collector returns home after 5 years to attend his younger "good brother's" funeral.It becomes quickly apparent the circumstances of his brother's death are not what they appear to be.Stallone makes up for his failure to be a part of the family these past few years by getting to the bottom of things and "making things right".With dark rainy imagery, some upbeat soundtrack movie and good acting by not only Stallone but Rourke and Leigh, this is a great film that deserved more attention.Only the casting of the billionaire computer-geek is bad casting.My wife loves this film so much she watches it at least once per month !

Although hardcore fans of the Resident Evil video game have complained about this movie series from the beginning, I gave the first two (2) Resident Evil movies very high marks for being a good modernized variation on the whole Zombie genre.With this third installment, I must now say it looks like it is time to end the series.This third movie seemed less like Resident Evil and more like a combined tribute or "homage" to ...Road WarriorThe BirdsDay of the DeadMatrixand The Sixth Day.... all wrapped into one.This film seemed to have a hard time finding it's center and just seemed like a mish-mash of random elements tossed in to give Alice an excuse to overuse her two curved battle swords.I bought the first two Resident Evil movies on DVD for our collection, but we have no plans to order this 3rd film.We would never care to watch it again.It was pretty flat.

I give this telling of the Planet of the Apes saga a 4 stars mostly because of the long hours and hard work that must have been spent creating the CGI apes.The CGI is impressive in an artistic way, but not so much in a realistic way.I don't know if it was intentional, or simply the limitations of computer animation at this time in history ,,, but at no time do you feel the ape characters are real.They are always un-realistic looking ........... but yet, I still find the animation impressive in an artistic, expressive way.The over all movie is a bit less than 4 stars.The story has some logic flaws in many places.The acting from many of the human actors seems stiff and "phoned in".The editing is a bit choppy.Nothing really wrong .... but just something that gives the movie a bit of a 'cut and paste" feel as opposed to a smooth compelling story.My biggest complaint ?The overall mood of the movie was not serious enough.I always felt Planet of the Apes universe had a darker mood and commentary about human society and social issues.This film seems to be kind of comical, light hearted and goofy all the way thru, even during what are intended to be heavy and serious scenes.It feels "too Hollywood formula" and bouncy and light-hearted.It is good family entertainment and certainly demonstrated long hours of hard work, but it feels like the producers relied on the CGI to carry the film and simply glossed over the other parts of the film.I am happy to see it made good $$$$ as I always like to see hard work get rewarded.We enjoyed the movie, but it did not impart a lasting impression and will not be added to our DVD collection.I doubt I would ever watch it again.I know this review seems a little "Jeckyl and Hyde".I guess I respect the hard work that went into making this movie, and I WANTED to be more excited about it............... but when all is said and done, when the movie was over there was no "WOW" factor or desire to order a copy for our own DVD collection.But certainly worth a watch

This "time is money" movie is a variation on the Logans Run idea with a little bit of modern political commentary thrown in.The premise was good and actually the first 40 minutes was interesting .... but then it quickly fell into repeated chase scenes, one liner jokes, and stopped being a serious heavy sci-fi movie and more of a Hollywood formula film

My wife has recently been on a craze where we are renting old movies from the 70s that we remembered as being great to watch again all these years later.It is funny how 37 years must change our views of the world.We recently rented LOVE STORY and about 60 minutes into the film, my wife commented to me...... "You can stop the movie if you want, I'm not watching it anyway. It is nowhere near as good as I remember".I agreed with her.I remember the film as being so powerful all those years ago........ now all we could see was some stiff acting, and poor characterization that made us not really care if Ali's character died or not.Certainly a far cry from the LOVE STORY we remembered.Another dissapointment from the 70s was BRIANS SONG.Seeing it again thru older matured eyes, it was too short (only a 71 minute movie) that never really developed the relationship between Piccolo and Sayer.It looked like a made for TV movieI think some of today's actors are really better than we give them credit for as we remember some of these older film actors thru rainbow tinted glasses

This is an addendum to my earlier review of 24 Season One where I indicated the Season started great but got a little silly mid-way thru.Without giving any spoilers I must also criticise parts of the Season Finale which while offering some possible surprises also make no logical sense based on the actions you have seen in the prior 23 episodes.In other words, after knowing how the first season ends, if you re-watch the whole season from the beginning and pay close attention to the characters, their actions, the opportunites they have and how things evolve, then the surprises at the end of the series are kind of just tossed in as a way to throw you off rather than having any logic or continuity.

There is only one word that comes to mind when reviewing this movie........... FLAT !It's not funny, not scary, not action packed, not a drama.... I don't know what they were aiming for here.I wanted to love this movie because I am a Haunted Mansion fanatic... I own every souvenier, sound effects album, copy of blueprints, etc.... available on the Haunted Mansion attraction and it's history.Regarding the movie, it was nice to see them use Walt's original idea for the architecture and the original 1950's Gracey mansion legend.Maybe only die-hard Doombuggy fans picked up on this dedication trivia.... BUT... the movie just did not come together in a successful way like Pirates did last year.It is probably still good family entertainment for 90 minutes or so... but nothing that will leave a lasting memory or impression.It felt like a movie &quot;made by committee&quot; where so many different people's input collided in such a way the movie just plodded along with no real life or &quot;spark&quot;.

Let me start by saying I think the idea of a Queen in modern times is a bit outdated and silly, however this film reminds us of something even MORE SILLY.... and that is the modern fascination of the general public over celebrities.It is amazing and unbelievable to me that the media has been able to generate such a "mythological importance" to Princess Diana that people in the general public who of course never knew her will camp out in the streets, cry and mourn for a literal stranger they have only seen in the news.It's a weird modern mass media phenomenon.This film reminds me of how the Queen was unfairly criticized by the media and public over not seeming emotional enough about Diana's death.Not to detract from Diana, buts lets face reality....... it's a Cinderella story gone bad.She was an immature girl who married into royalty, never appreciated the responsibility of the role and thus like a spoiled kid lashed out at the century old establishment.Then she tried to establish her own identity as a caring person by being involved with humanitarian efforts while partying it up with controversial figures who she knew would cast a poor light on Mother England.I don't dislike Diana, but I do question the "saint-like" mythology that has been generated about her while the general public conveniently forgets the reality of who she was and what she did.

Think of a blend between LOGANS RUN and THE SIXTH DAY... but not as good.About 70 minutes into this movie my wife and I looked at each other and said.. "Had enough yet ?"The eject button was our next move.Even without watching the whole film it just seemed like one of those "clones learn their true identity and develop their own individual will to live and try to break free to release their fellow clones"..yadda...yadda...yadda....I SHOULD have liked this film, I'm a sci-fi buff and have even liked Bay's other work...... but this one just FELT like one of those bad 1970s sci-fi flicks like Soylent Green or Omega Man (a weak remake of the classic Vincent Price film)I did not check the box office results for this film, but I think it came and went pretty much un-noticed too

Ouch this was a BAD movie !!It started off very, very good.But then all of a sudden, they apparently started trying to throw in every Sci-Fi angle they could think of.Take every episode of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits you can think of ....... put it in a blender ......... filter out the best parts ...... and then whatever silly sludge is left over use to make "The Box".We watched this with some close friends (we have them over twice per month for dinner and movie night).This movie had the whole room groaning and laughing on the floor making comments like ...... "Ouch this is really bad. It's like watching Mystery Science Theatre".

This movie was not as bad as many claim ............. but ............ uhmmmm ........... I can see why the critics were harsh. Something does not work here.I am always hesitant to criticize something when I know how much hard work went into making it.After all, it is much easier to be a critic, than to actually create something.So I always fall back to the adage that it is too easy to sit back and criticize other people's work and efforts -- but what have YOU ever created ???The premise of this movie was good.You can see much work went into it.It was entertaining for 100 minutes.But it never really comes together and is very forgettable.What went wrong ?The movie gives me the same feeling I had watching Kevin Costner play Robin Hood.Cage and Perlman seem out of place and time.I always say you know you are watching a well made movie when even for a brief moment you are pulled into the film and forget it is a movie.But that does not happen with this movie.The whole time it feels like modern people, wearing old time outfits trying to look like ancient times, walking thru sets and CGI screens acting a part.The screenplay also seemed disjointed as though the film went thru a lot of trouble to me made and went thru years and years of re-writes by different people.The movie also shifts moods and tones. This may be a symptom of the problem I mentioned above about the film taking a long time to be made and going thru many re-writes.It starts with a dark and serious tone.Then at times it becomes kind of goofy and comical.etc.....etc.....etc.....It is almost as though there was a fight behind the scenes with different producers as to what type of movie they were trying to make.So, it left us with a strange love/hate feeling when it was over.You never felt Cage and Perlman were really in character.They seemed out of place in these roles, and you only saw the actor -- not the character.It has been said that people either like or dislike Cage.Personally, we usually like him ........ but it did not seem he was really into making this movie.It seemed he was only doing the movie out of a need for income or something --- hard to explain, but it seemed Cage was just going thru the motions and privately disliked this project.The story seemed a bit forced and unfocused (rewrites ??)It was clear that much work went into making the film, and we wanted to like it more.Sadly the final battle scene also fails. The director uses the fast choppy editing that is in vogue now. I suppose young directors think that choppy, accelerated strobe like editing is supposed to add tension, but all it does is make things hard to see. Unfortunately the revealed evil entity looks a bit comical like something from a video game. Perhaps old fashioned techniques would have beat CGI here.In the final analysis ......... it was entertaining enough that we wanted to finish watching it to see the whole story ............. BUT ............ it is not a film we would watch again or consider buying on DVD.

Several years ago I was introduced to the term "artsy fartsy".... meaning of course when something tries too hard to be artistic and in the process bores the life out of the 99% of the general public who are not artists themselves.Sometimes certain musicians, filmakers and other artists get so entrenched in their own world they end up making projects to impress other artists rather than being entertaining or though provoking to general masses.In this case it seems the writer/director took an excellent idea and premise but tried to make a film for his fellow film school students rather than the 60,000,000 people who grab videos off the Blockbuster shelf on the weekend.I liked the premise and the idea of the film, but the screenplay was never developed.... it simply was a showcase for lighting, angles, mood, atmoshere and the technical aspects of filmaking without the needed soul and depth.Mia Sorvino was a throw away character and was not really needed in the film.... her character seemed like a force fit that could have been eliminated with no loss of continuity.

Simply stated.... THE GREAT RAID should be required viewing for that sector of negative minded and soft Americans today who whine and complain about everything from gas prices to health care costs to politics to the Iraq War, etc....Too many Americans today have become too soft and forgotten what difficulty, honor, ethics, integrity and grit are all about.While sitting in the comfort of their living rooms, watching a big screen TV and getting fat they criticize the Country they live in, badmouth our history, whine and complain about virtually everything while they themselves have probably never faced any problems worse than the inconvenience of a flat tire or rush-hour traffic.The GREAT RAID in many ways is more authentic in it's depictions of planning and participating in military strategies than many more famous films (ie.. Private Ryan, etc..)It is a shame and a sad commentary on the state of America today that a film like this did not perform better in terms of Sales and exposure.I truly feel this deserves to be mandatory viewing for many Americans today who are misguided and living clueless with a negative self centered view of their world.

The first thing I have to say about this film is it did not really FEEL like a George Romero film.It felt like somebody trying to imitate Romero's style.... maybe just because it has been so many years since Romero did a film like this.Oddly enough, even though it was a comedy and spoof, I feel last year's SHAUN OF THE DEAD actually captured the Romero feel better.I actually give LAND 3.5 stars because even though they did a good job showing the evolution and advancement of the problem, it did not quite "come together".There was never really a feeling of impending doom like in the other "Romero Zombie Trilogy"...... this one had more of a typical Hollywood feel to it.We never really got a connection with any of the characters or cared about them much.It was all a little "stiff" and did not "pull you in" like the first three in the series.At least I am glad to see the Zombies the way they are supposed to be....slow lumbering masses... and not the olympic runners oj steroids moving as fast as lightening in recent films.The creepiness of Zombies comes from the fact that even though they move slowly, the growing numbers will overwhelm you eventually... that's the "creeping death" and is much scarier than a supposed Zombie that moves like a Mountain lion ....geezzzz.Question........ What happened to the TWILIGHT OF THE DEAD script Romero wanted to shoot for years ?This movie LAND OF THE DEAD (Dead Reckoning) is NOT that ame story from what I gather.Good to see George back.LAND was better than the other attempts out there, but despite the budget, big studio distribution, etc.... it did not quite have the same "magic" as the first 3.

The only reason I am writing a quick review of this movie is to defend it.It is much better than critics and others have said.It may be faulted for giving away too much a little too early, but the story and acting deserves more credit than this film has received.I have heard that the Director and the actors hated the final cut of the film so much they refused to participate in marketing or interviews for the movie .... and the Director wanted his name removed.That is a lot of animosity.I don't really understand it.I have seen much less entertaining movies that did not suffer this image problem.

Here we go again .. yet another example of Hollywood in all it's ignorance of real world intelligence and history making a movie that is nothing more than a thinly veiled propoganda tool.It seems guys like Damon, Clooney and others have confused their ability to act and make believe in the world of film making with the complexities of the real world.An otherwise potentially good film plot was ruined by this movie's overbearing preaching, conspiracy theory perpetuation and excessive left leaning political slant.It is always better when film makers lift themselves ABOVE mundane daily politics and have their movies portray Universal Values and messages.Instead, this film gets sucked into the muck and mire of the daily politics we see in the world of FOX NEWS -vs- CNN NEWS. As a result it gets warped into nothing more than an excuse for some film makers in Hollywood to vent their political views and stand on a soapbox for 100 minutes trying to sway public sentiment to their way of thinking.Pretty forgettable. This film will probably make less than $40 million and dissapear from people's minds in less than 30 days.

Jennifer Connelly does an exceptional acting job in this film that creates a dark wet soggy atmosphere for 100 minutes, but never develops any substance.The film seems like a study in using atmosphere to set a mood but little more.Does anybody else notice that RING, RING 2, GRUDGE and now DARK WATER are all the same story slightly rehashed and done over and over again ?Amazing they have been able to make money by making the exact same movie 4 times from the same basic story (ie... lost or neglected kid and water coming from beyond the grave)This was hard to take serious with nothing but drips, water leaks and geysers for 90 minutes...... and of course it was not helped any with the ending kind of given away in the first 15 minutes.HINT..... as mentioned above, this is a quick rehash of Ring and Grudge, etc...

I had heard of the Treadwell tragedy but knew little about the man himself.Watching this documentary, if one did not know it was based on a true story you would think it was a comical spoof of some sort.Everybody in the film from the coroner to ex-friends of Treadwell act like oddities.Treadwell himself we learn was not a true naturalist but instead seemed to be some burned out surfer dude from California with a mental imbalance of some sort and a warped sense of reality.The guy was seriously mentally offbalance.Watching this documentary you realize Treadwell was not in ove with the Grizzly as much as he was with himself.This would have been a much more powerful story if the subject in question was a true naturalist who truly did some good for the Grizzly instead of some self-proclaimed whacko who fabricated 1/2 of his stories.It is of course tragic that he was mauled by bears, but somehow it is harder to empathize when he was basically over the line and recklessly putting himself at risk all the time instead of treating bears with respect and observing them without interference.

I rate this 1 star and call it garbage not because of the racy subject matter (that COULD have been interesting), but because the film is unwatchable.It looks like somebody took screen captures from a webcam to make the film.. fuzzy, jerky motion that is annoying to try and watch.Almost like the movie is skipping every 3rd frame or running on an altered framerate or something.The girl is sexy (in a skanky way)... but NO WAY would she mess around with the greaseballs cast in this film.15 minutes of trying to watch and then EJECT !!Video quality worse than a home movie.

Ouch this was horrible !The premise and idea for this movie was a good one, thus is had great potential.However it was totally ruined by......1) Way too much silly CGI and unrealistic action scenes that felt like a real-life Bugs Bunny cartoon.2) Campy and Cheesy humor like hitting somebody with a keyboard and having the flying letters off the keyboard form words in slow motion on the screen in Matrix-like fashion.3) A plot that took a second seat to special effects and thus was as deep as a thimble of water.If this same story had been filmed in a serious manner, it would have probably been very,very good ----- but instead it bounced around between serious, campy, cheesy, spoofy to the point that it seemed the movie did not know what it wanted to be.Ouch... this was just painful to watch.A totally forgetable movie.

Unfortunatley PRESTIGE did not quite live up to the "dueling magicians" concept the film appeared it would be in the previews.Also, we always hate films that pretty much start near the end, then tell the whole story in backflash.......... that knocks 1/2 the wind out of a film's sails everytime.Great idea, but faltered in it's execution despite all the great talent involved.The ILLUSIONIST was a much more entertaining period piece about magic withgood plot twists

This was a pretty well done "documentary" about food in our society.I see most reviewers here focus on the film's harsh view of corporations and the food industry .............. BUT ............ I think a more important message in this film is for people to STOP BUYING AND EATING CRAP !!!There are plenty of good sources of food out there; especially if you do more cooking at home and don't even think about ever stepping foot inside 99.9999% of franchised restaurants again or buying TV dinners.In general, the food factories certainly deserve some blame ; but so do many individuals who make bad choices for themselves.

In terms of the mechanics of film making this was an OK movie......... BUT........ Oh what a tedious effort to sit thru hoping something interesting or thought provoking would happen.The dialogue was tough to follow with either heavy accents or worst yet bad sound on the English speaking actors that made it sound like everybody was mumbling or had marbles in their mouth.This felt less like a movie and more like a very, very, very slow moving version of a PC-based adventure game like MYST or SYBERIA where you walk around looking for clues and keys to play the game.In the end.... it was hard to really care what was happening to any of the characters in the least.

Oddly enough my wife and I always loved BECKER when we used to catch it on TV during its original run, but we were never regular viewers.I guess it came on at a time slot we just missed.We really watched it more in syndication and of course now on the DVD collection.The best thing I can say about BECKER is even though they write the show to kind of stab some fun at him........ the truth is he is right on the mark about 99% of the time on the things he gripes about........ (ie.. people acting stupid, rude neighbors playing loud music, stereotypes, the silliness of political correctness, etc...)BECKER has the right viewpoint most of the time.I have to confess we started losing interest in the show after Reggi & Bob left.Like many TV shows, the "chemistry" between leading cast often makes the show.The "chemistry" of BECKER was lost quite a bit when Nancy Travis joined the show.We found her a real negative detraction from the series.

CHEERS will always be among our favorite TV shows of all time.It came out at a time when "charm and wit" as well as good writing and only subtle sexual humor was tossed into TV shows.(Unlike the majority of modern TV shows which are like one trick ponies simply relying on one crude sex joke after another with no real creativity).We of course have been buying ALL the Cheers episodes on DVD because this is a show we would rather watch 100 times over on a rainy night as opposed to 98% of the stuff on TV today.HOWEVER........ having said that.Magic never lasts forever.Even for CHEERS.Season 9 was the season where one could really detect a major difference in the writing and the feel of the show.The old charm of Cheers seems to be fading away and replaced with pretty silly and "over the top" story lines that don't have the same feeling.We of course will also buy Season 10-11 when they come out (hopefully)........ but like all things in life........ there comes a time when things begin to fade and eventually die.Season 9 marks the beginning of the end for this great, legendary TV series.

I should have guessed that Sean Penn and Hollywood would become increasingly unable to make good decent film without using them as a springboard for their political views (most of which are wrong of course).I had high hopes for this film and only gave it 2 stars because of Nicole Kidman.The story plods along SLOWLY and PAINFULLY with no tension, no anxiety.... in fact, you dont care for any of the characters in the least.This feels like on of those 70s films like "All the Presidents Men" that simply puts you to sleep.Lost of talk and attempts at creating a storyline about attempting to stop the supposed assassination of some tyrannical leader of a 3rd world country.It's hard to care to much if he gets knocked off or not.Penn and Kidman's characters seem stilted and stiff.Simply put...... the film has ZERO suspense, ZERO tension, and stirs ZERO interest for the characters.It simply does not come together and WORK like a good "magical movie" like Shawshenk Redemption, Door to Door, Straight Story or other great non-action movies do.A high budget clunker.

Ugghhh.... 40 minutes into this remake disaster, we hit the EJECT button.Yes... with modern effects the waves were bigger, the flames bigger the explosions were bigger.....So what was missing ?SOUL and a concern about the characters.The remake was all "flash" and "effects" with no "life" to the characters.Unlike the original with Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, etc...In this remake you simply don't care if the main characters live or die..... nor do you get lost in the movie.

This film is a textbook example of "artsy fartsy"........that odd term that describes when a creative person tries to make something odd or controversial just for the sake of being odd or controversial.Some will try to read some deeper social meaning or commentary into this film.But they are simply "cloud watching"........ meaning that when we stare at a shapeless cloud long enough our conditioned mind attempts to create a recognizable shape out of it.It is the same with this film.... although it is really just odd nonsense to throw off the audience, many will try to find some deep meaning in this film.I think the writer/director is having fun pulling the leg of his audience.How did they get Naomi Watts to do this film ?Now THAT is a real mystery !!!

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER (BY RELATIVE ASSOCIATION) .....................................................................................................This movie is best described as a much weaker rehash of Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter set in modern times.In the first 15 minutes you have figured out the whole story, the identity of the Traveler is telegraphed much too early which kills any mystery, tension or suspense ....... So unfortunately you must then sit thru the next 85 minutes waiting to see the inevitable scenes you know are coming and the ending that you already figured out in that same first 15 minutes.

I think the director of this DVD must misunderstand FOX's slogan... &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;........... what Fox means is they are the one news network that makes things &quot;fair and balanced&quot; by trying to offset the far left leaning of vistually every other news source out there.... NBC, ABC, CBS, MSNBS, CNN, TNT, etc..If &quot;slanted news&quot; is REALLY his concern, why pick on FOX for leaning to the right ?Why not go after EVERY OTHER News Channel that leans to the left....WAY TO THE LEFT !!The reason of course is he has an agenda..DUH

This game will get trashed in reviews by people used to adventure games like SYBERIA and the like.COLD CASE FILES is probably best suited as an introduction to adventure games for the very beginner or relatively young.COLD CASE FILES-THE GAME is VERY, VERY LINEAR and VERY VERY short.You can easily solve all 6 games (plus the free bonus game) in under 90 minutes with full success.None of the games are very hard.COLD CASE FILES: The Game would give a total beginner a "taste" of what adventure gaming is like without overwhelming them.... on the otherhand, the experienced gamer will find it very dissapointing.I would also recommend Dracula Resurrection and Dracula Sanctuary as adventure games for the first-timer (who is a bit more serious about getting into adventure games) as these are both excellent.In fact, I liked the Dracula series better than the critically acclaimed Syberia I&II.....; probably because of the darker atmosphere and themes, though they were a bit easier.

Sadly, this film accurately portrays a growing trend of violence and urban decay in many cities around the world.I have seen some of the other reviews comment that this film is "unrealistic".Well these people should say their prayers and be grateful that their own worlds are so safe, sheltered and isolated from this very real growing problem that they believe it to be make believe or nonsense.Perhaps we are becoming too soft, perhaps too many people try to ignore growing problems, maybe too many people live safe isolated lives and choose to deny this world exists, maybe too many people try to rationalize, justify and make excuses for the growing social problems in our world ............ whatever the reasosn, sadly this film depicts a life too many good people are forced to live in today's changing urban environments everywhere.LA, New York, Miami, London, and even some smaller cities ........ it seems we don't simply eradicate and eliminate people are are so criminal, so vile and so evil that they do not DESERVE to live.They are nothing more than wastes of human flesh that offer NOTHING to their fellow man except pain and misery.The film itself drags a bit for the first half (Like many British films) and actually spends almost too much time on plot development (a rare situation in modern film making)... but the last half picks up the pace and effectively delivers the intended social commentary and message.Caine is very good as is to be expected.

CGI abuse has become a disease ... a cancer.Some genius got the idea of tampering with the classic Star Trek by trying to "improve" some of the vintage 1960s visual effects with modern CGI.First they look out of place ... like a butcher job.Second, in many cases the original images look better than the even more cheesy computer video game quality CGI images.Also theme musics were changed ... etc...Basically it is a crime what they did to this classic TV seriesThe original DVD series (35 sheel cases - 2 shows per disc) is still the best

As many have mentioned before, the acting in this movie is very, very well done.In fact, in many ways this seems more a movie by actors for actors than it is a movie for the public.By that,I mean viewers of this movie can appreciate the acting ability ...... and other actors can study the dynamics, even if the movie itself goes nowhere.What do I mean by going nowhere ?The movie of course focuses on a couple grieving the loss of their child.This is already a difficult story to develop into a 2 hour movie.In the film, the story does not really move past being a collection of "different scenes of grieving in different ways".It is sort of stagnant in that regard.In fact, both my wife and I remarked to each other that considering the sad nature of the story, neither of us felt the least bit of emotional involvement in the film.It did not touch us, or stir even the beginnings of a tear of wave of sadness.Just kind of bland and distant.But again, the acting is exceptional and I am sure Kidman and the others will always be proud of the work they did on this film from an artistic sense.So the film wins 4 stars for the professionalism and acting performances ........ not the overall film itself.

Everytime an idea hits big, studios race to imitate that concept until they grind that trend into the ground...It seems in the past 2 years there have been a flurry of films trying to reproduce the feel and success of Braveheart and Gladiator.Each have failed and been worse than the one before it.We have had Troy, several other forgettable ones that escape me now and here we have Alexander.This film should ring the deathbell for "Sword and Sandle" movies for awhile.I won't repeat what others have said here, but all I can add is that after watching this for 3 hours with friends.... when it was over we all looked at each other and commented..........."That was painful to watch wasn't it".To which the reply was.... "Oh I thought I was the only one that felt that way, if I knew you guys had the same feeling I would have suggested ejecting the DVD 2 hours ago !"Definatley not a movie that draws you in.When you see a great well done movie, you can almost forget for awhile you are watching a movie with actors playing a part and feel what you are seeing is real............ but with Alexander you FEEL like you are watching Colin Farrell play the part of a historic figure and in fact the whole film feels strained and forced like it just never got itself together.It's obvious alot of work and effort went into this film and for this I feel sorry for alot of the folks in it, because for all that effort it still falls flat and will probably be remembered as a cinematic failure.Unless you are an absolute fan of the historical figure Alexander, steer clear of this film.In fact even if you are a big fan of Alexander the Great, you make wish to steer clear of this film as it tends to highlight his faults, failures and weakneses over his strengths and actually diminishes his historical significance to the point of making him appear irrelevent.Usually in a historical film like this you get MORE interested in the focal character and afterwards want to go out and buy a book or find more information about them........ with Alexander,during the last 45 minutes of the film my wife and I were whispering to each other....... "Die already"Afterwards our friends admitted they were thinking the same thing to themselves.One of my friends who is not very historically knowledgable asked me afterwards.... "Hey Mike, why is he called Alexander the Great anyway ? Unless they skipped over it in this film, he really didn't accomplish much afterall did he except run his people ragged on some warped vision he had ?"Not the effect I imagine the producers and director were going for.

RAMBO (2008) should be mandatory viewing for all citizens in the United States ?Why do I say this ?We as a society have had it so good for so long that too many of our people take our quality of life for granted today and thus sit back with apathy as warning signs pop up in front of us everyday that the America we loved and respected and was once great.... is eroding away from within every day.It's depressing to see this once great nation rot from within like the Roman Empire did before us.Along these lines, too many American citizens today know almost nothing about the world beyond AMERICAN IDOL and GREYS ANATOMY TV shows.No lie....... when my wife and I were leaving the theatre after seeing RAMBO (2008) a group of 30-something adults were walking in front of us.....They commented to each other....."Is Burma a real country or did they make that up for the movie ?"YIKES.... we let people like this actually vote !Many people focus only on the violence in this film and perhaps miss the larger symbolism that Stallone often interjects into his films.Rambo, like many of us in our late 40s and older see people in power making the same mistakes, people becoming less thoughtful and considerate of others and basically see the damage caused by open door immigration and unchecked urban growth.It all seems to prove the old adage to be more true than ever........"Its a shame man's moral and social development fails to keep pace with his technological advances".RAMBO reminds us of the type of integrity and determination and self-analysis real heroes and leaders go thru in life.Unfortunately we see little of these noble characteristics in either cinema or real-life anymore.The fact that a 61 year old action hero can outshine and ourperform today's modern "heroes" like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt on the screen is also a parrallel commentary on where our society is today.We don't have many John Waynes, Charles Bronsons, Clint Eastwoods, or Stallones in our society today.Instead we have limp "dish-rags" and decadent morals and wimpbaits who like to cry, whine, gripe and complain about things but never want to step up and actually fix or solve any problems.Where have all the leaders gone ?We certainly don't have any running for President in 2008 for example.

When I first read about this film in FANGORIA magazine months ago, I was excited........ The government continuing the occult experiments the Nazi Germans were dabbling with during the 1930-1940s.Sounded like an excellent premise.Now let me say right now, I don't like to criticize creative work unless it REALLY deserves it.I know how hard it is to create movies and music.So I only write reviews on Amazon for 2 reasons...1) Something is VERY VERY good and I want to tell people they should see it.2) Something is SO BAD, I feel obligated to warn others not to waste their time.UNHOLY is beyond bad.I dont' know if they were trying to be silly with this film, or experiment with music video ideas... or actually what they were trying to do.This film suffers from the ....... "since we are blending together government conspiracy, Nazis, the occult, time travel, invisibility and mind control all into a single plot line, we don't have to worry about consistency. NOTHING needs to connect together or make sense."So for 117 minutes this film jumps back and forth with images of people effected by the events of the Necromancer and the continuation of these radical new blendings of the occult and science.....but do we really care ?NOThere is never any feeling of tension or suspense.Never any care for any of the characters. Let them all die, good riddance.Never a real feeling that this "threat" will affect the outside world.It is rare this happens with a movie, but you almost find yourself angry at the end that you spent 2 hours of your life actually paying for and watching this.We had a "movie night" with 5 people at the house (all aged 43-50) who have probably seen every horror and sci-fi film in history.At the end the group honestly looked at each other and said out loud........ "Do we all agree that was probably the worst piece of crap you have ever seen?"The only worst film we could recall was "Blair Witch Project".

Pretty good movie... it does a nice job of developing tension and suspense.The only reason we probably did not like it more was some bad acting from all but the 2 lead characters and more importantly about 35 minutes into the film we had already figured out who the killer was and the whole "punch line" of the movie..... so rather than being held in suspense, we were impatient for the movie to "get to the end already" since we already knew who & why the killer was who they were !"

The first three FINAL DESTINATION movies were very good, creative, imaginative and well done.We own all 3 of these in our DVD collection.The latest addition to the series is pretty much crap.Bad casting and acting (none of the characters are memorable and you don't really care what happens to them).The violent deaths are too obvious, silly and gimmicky as though they had to find excuses to include shots that would work with 3D.This latest movie seems more like a parody or a cheap imitation of the original Final Destination idea.Really bad.

Only the talents of DiCaprio and Kate Winslet keep this story watchable.Otherwise it is a lame story.In a nutshell, this movie keeps hammering the point that the 1950's were not really as wonderful as portrayed in classic shows like Andy Griffith and Happy Days.The film also attempts to portray the American Dream and Suburban living as a lie and a depressing prison.Okay ..... we all know the "good old days" were not as pure and innocent as Happy Days ------ BUT, at the other extreme -------- neither were they as depressing and jaded as Revolutionary Road.Unless of course you were dysfunctional and mentally unstable and generally negative about living.This film attempts to send a message that the good life of the 1950s was all a lie of fake smiles, depressions, frustration and harmful materialism.The characters in this film have a nice home in a quiet neighborhood, recently were chosen for a promotion and a raise, take vacations at the beach, etc..etc..etc..The wife is in perpetual misery because her dream is to toss all this aside and go slum it up in Paris.In the process she acts like a miserable person on the edge of a mental breakdown.Her husband is no angel, but he certainly puts up with more of her whacky unstable behaviour than most would put up with.The movie tries to hard to demonize the rise of middle class suburban living in America and offer a derivative view of life in the 1950s era.The facts are not matter what time in history you examine, you will find people who are both happy and others who are miserable.That is no different today than it was then.However, having lived in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and today ....... I DO believe life in America was better 20-30 years ago.And while there is no time in human history that is perfect (nothing involving people ever will be) ... I can certainly say living in the 70s and 80s in America was better than what we are experiencing today with the direction this Country is heading.

During the 90s, Full Moon Entertainment and Charles Band were the KINGS of "direct to video" and "B movies" with CLASSICS like Puppet Masters, Castle Freak, SubSpecies, etc...But since the millenium, it seems Full Moon and Band have become a spoof of themselves releasing terribly bad movies that are not bad due to budget limitations, but simply due to silliness, stupidity and campiness.GingerDead Man may be the final blow.... this HORRIBLE film epitomizes what has become of the once cool FULL MOON ENTERNTAINMENT.All the Band films are now the same formula... usually some variation of small re-animated monsters (Doll Graveyard, GingerDead Man, etc...) and don't even try to be good anymore..... it is almost as though they revel in their own badness.Go to the old 90's back catalog if you want to see some good FULL MOON movies and Charles Band when he took his film-making seriously.But stay away from the new FULL MOON stuff....... GingerDead man was the final blow for us !If it says Full Moon on the cover from now on, it stays on the shelf!

We have a group of friends who get together every other weekend to play various adventure games while sitting in a group around a computer and taking turns at the mouse while using group strategy to complete the game.We have played tons of them... many from DreamCatcher.DARK FALL rates among the most boring.In fact we uninstalled it and threw it in the trash.The first and most annoying feature was the interface.In today's world of PC gaming, having static still shots of your environment (like early days of MYST) is lame.Realistic 3D environments where you can spin and get your bearings is the only acceptable interface for these types of games anymore...... a series of still scenes with no movement ability inside your screen is quickly disinteresting and detracts from the game.After about an hour, this game hit the trash can.There are much more engaging adventure games out there to have fun with

Well done film.Kind of combines elements of "ABSOLUTE POWER" and "BOURNE SUPREMACY" into a single film.Is good to see a film that draws a clear line between good and evil, unlike the wishy washy "everything in the world is grey" message Hollywood tends to send these days.What prevents 5 stars ?I suppose it is to be expected with Danny Glover involved in the project, but in an attempt to explain the crookedness of world governments in general, they take a few overly obvious stabs at US President Bush that seem a bit forced and contrived and awkward.Hollywood.... unless you are making true documentaries, keep your politics and propaganda at home !

The other reviewers do a good job pointing out the problem with this movie .It seemed to fight with itself to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be .a) Serious survival story-or-b) Unrealistic supernatural CG! wolf-monster movie--or--c) Symbolic movie about soul searching and self redemptionPerhaps by trying to be three movies at once, it never quite succeeded at reaching its full potential on any of the levels.It was beautifully shot.Great acting by all involved.Well written dialog.Did a fair job of pulling you into their situation .........BUT ............SOMETHING just didn't work and the film never really touches or grabs you.It's like a well done technical movie ... but missing a soul or spirit that gets to you.It's hard to place a finger on what exactly was missing in the movie, but it just kind of lumbered along ---- ended ...... and then was pretty forgetable.My wife just looked at me and went ......

My wife and I had no previous exposure to the books upon which this Showtime movie is based, but found it to be pretty flat.The Southern stereotypes were WAY OVERDONE and were downright hilarious.... kind of like Hollywood's idea of what the South is like.Kyra Sedgewick's charachter is totally unlikeable and gives you no sympathy for her plight.My wife blurted out once or twice.... the best way for this movie to progress would be for this piece of white trash (Sedgewisk's character) to die and maybe the three daughters could get some inheritance money from their musician father's estate and get a real life away from this dysfunctional mom.It certainly did not appeal to the "chick-flick" side of my wife's emotions at all....Give me a good movie like THE STRAIGHT STORY or DOOR TO DOOR anyday over this.

I have used several MAGIX products over the years.Considering the $$ spent, I have usually been very pleased.It seems MAGIX takes features from it's more professional products and makes stripped down, simpler versions for the general consumer or hobbyist.(example: Audio Cleaning Lab contains many of the features from the pro recording studio software SAMPLITUDE. In fact you can sometimes find errors in the manual where they copied text and accidently left the word SAMPLITUDE in the instructions).MOVIE EDIT PRO 11 works fines for my needs.I largely shoot underwater video in either AVI or MPG formats.I then need to edit this videos into "underwater sightseeing or adventure videos" with transitions, music soundtracks, chapters, and color enhancements, etc...This software has worked great.2 words of advice I will caution people about when working with MAGIX products.......1) Due to the low software price, the company must cut costs someplace and that seems to be Customer Service.In a word..... forget about it. You are on your own.MAGIX virtually never answers emails or calls.2) Save Often !!MAGIX is not alone in this arena, but many Audio and Video editing software platforms really put a load on a PC (even a powerful one) and thus these applications tend to lock up or crash from time to time during really heavy multi-task processing with real-time effects........ So............. SAVE OFTEN !Your life will be easierI tend to save different versions along the way (V1, V2, V3) so I can retrace back to a prior save if anything gets glitchy.

Angelina Jole is an attractive lady, so sexy nude scenes of her are always welcome... BUT...I question why she would be willing to show flesh in a lame movie such as this.Predictabilty is the first problem with this film.No question por mystery who the killer is after the first 15 minutes.Poor acting by Ethan Hawke.A short cameo by Keifer Sutherland that was not needed and very, very brief.All in all this looked and felt like a "Made for TV" movie except for the nudity and occasional graphic crime scene shots.I am sure with some editing you will see this movie on LIFESTYLE: TELEVISION FOR WOMEN because it rapidly drops from being a "find the serial killer" movie into a romantic twist film..... seemed forced and unnatural.The worst complaint......... THE SOUND MAN FOR THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE SHOT !!!!I can't remember the last time I had to roller-coaster my volume control up and down non-stop thru the entire movie.Dialogue scenes could barely be heard and action scenes overloaded the sound system..... I had to watch the movie with the TV volume remote in my hand and readjust volume from scene to scene.

To somebody very familiar with investing, money management and Wall Street politics, this movie will be interesting especially considering the fine acting talents involved.To the average citizen who is not familiar with economics, this movie will no doubt be as boring as watching paint dry.The problem ?The movie really does nothing more than show people stressing out over seeing their high flying way of life come to an end.There is no good detail or explanation of how financial models and the world of investing really work for the general audience.I feel failing to really scrape beneath the surface and tell the whole story will leave many viewers lost and clueless as to what is really happening most of the time.

We normally like Kate Beckinsale very much .... having followed her career since HAUNTED.But in WHITEOUT, she seems detached and uninterested like she really did not want to make this movie.The scenery was very nice and the set-up to the story was well done.But 20 minutes into the movie, something falls apart.The whole plot reveals itself and they pretty much give away the whole scheme and the principle players behind it.... so for the rest of the movie you are sitting waiting for the ending that you already know is coming.As a result the movie has no life or energy, it just plods along and goes thru the motions.This happens every so often. You have a healthy budget, good location, a good basic premise for a story and a collection of fine actors ........ all great ingredients ............ but sometimes the ingredients don't result in a satisfying dish.Certainly worth watching once for entertainment, but I doubt this movie will be added to many private home DVD collections and will soon be totally forgotten.

I guess it is true what they say about things going in circles.It is kind of surprising this film generated as much excitement as it did.Quite honestly it felt just like watching a 1970's version of MUTUAL OF OMAHA'S WILD KINGDOM.If this film had come out back then it would have been relegated to simply being a weekly episode of this popular TV series.However in today's world where Hollywood has gotten carried away with either...1) Going overboard with CGI special effects and zero story-OR-2) Making Liberal "Anti-American" propaganda agenda movies like George Clooneys disgusting and abysmal new piece of trash "Syriana"....this March of the Pengiuns is a refreshing and wholesome change.

A well thought out little horror story with a great look for the budget and timeframe in which it was shot.......... the only negative drawback ?The 2 actors.Whenever the movie reaches a point where the terror/tension is reaching a peak, the 2 actors come across as comical and humorous instead of scared and terrified.One gets the impression the 2 main actors kept laughing while doing the most horrifying scenes and the director/editor had to finally give up and splice together the scenes where they seemed to be cracking up the least.My wife for example kept asking me.... "Do you think they wanted this to be dark humor or something ?"I replied "No.. the actors are trying to act extremely terrified, they just can't pull it off and come across like they are doing a spoof"If you overlook those acting ability limitations...the whole film as a package is well done.At least I stayed awake thru this film unlike the horribly boring and overated "GRUDGE", which I have no idea how anybody finds interesting.

The WOODSMAN features excellent acting by Bacon and Sedgewick..BUT.... we have to question the motivations behind the Hollywood film community who seem to be recently releasing a load of similiar films trying to evoke sympathy for Child Molestors and Pedophiles.What is the point of this movie ?What is the real motivation behind the writers and creators of this film ?This socially liberal mindset that seems to be poisoning America is beginning to concern me.It seems there is a movement afoot to try and rationalize all forms of behaviour as acceptable and tell us we should be tolerant of people's differences no matter how evil, twisted, sick or perverted.Great job done as a film in terms of acting and production..... but not sure I like the message trying to be sent.

QUESTION.... What makes a good film ?ANSWER.... When a creative group of individuals can make a movie you enjoy despite your initial disinterest in seeing it at all.I care very little about Napolean and even less for French history. But my wife wanted to see this movie.(I prefer Italian and German and Roman history).Surprisingly it was one of the most entertaining movies we have rented in a long time.Very well done !!!

This film indirectly pays homage (and borrows heavily) from a classic psychopathic killer film from the past .... (I WON'T SAY MORE THAN THAT).........and for a lower budget film is MUCH BETTER and MORE ENTERTAINING than 80% of the bigger budget films seen these days.I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the way certain scenes were shot tend to intentionally mislead the viewer as to the true storyline... even so about 60 minutes into the film everything came together and the ending was pretty well figured out.Despite these minor criticisms, it again was very well done.

I must admit I rarely have the patience to sit thru a subtitled movie, but DOWNFALL is so well done, I did not mind and I think hearing 100% German in relation to the time period and subject helped reinforce the realism.Whenever a movie can make you (even for the briefest of seconds) forget you are watching a movie and really get pulled in, then it succeeds.Downfall does this superbly.On the otherhand, garbage like Hollywood's "PEARL HARBOR" from a few years back looks and "feels" like a Hollywood set and movie and you never really "believe" you are in 1945.With DOWNFALL you can almost get the sense you are in the bunker with Hitler and the SS during the Final Days.

Aeon Flux is an example of what happens when Hollywood tries to get too "artsy fartsy.The animated series does not translate well to live action in this film.What seems cool in the animated series comes across as contrived and cheesey in the film.After 35 minutes my wife begged me to hit EJECT.I was being nice, I would have hit the STOP button 10 minutes earlier.Basically unwatchable

This movie makes you realize how badly the United States needs to adopt a ZERO TOLERANCE "shoot on sight" POLICY to stop illegal immigration (aka.. Passive Invasion) and quit playing around with this issue.There should be ONE AND ONLY ONE process by which people (from anywhere) apply for entry into the USA that is FIRM BUT FAIR TO ALL.Outside of that single process, no other form of entry should be allowed .......... Period.This film seemed to have the intention and goal of making you feel sympathetic, but instead it was simply an annoying reminder of how soft and stupid we have become in this Western Society when it comes to creating Firm and Fair laws, and then enforcing them without fail.Now everything is an exception to the rule and slop prevails.An infuriating film that gets the blood boiling !

We awaited this movie with anticipation only to be VERY dissapointed.Hollywood......PAY ATTENTION..... $50 Million in special effects and $10 dollars of plot, screenplay and acting do NOT make a good memorable movie!This film is a textbook example of wasted potential..The set designs were great.. the atmosphere building was great.... the general premise was great........ after that it all falls apart.What we get is 2 hours of a woman running around in a maze of CGI and set designs trying to act scared and frantic.The actual images of what are supposed to be horrible are choppy, brief and incohesive.Never is a feeling of dread or actual horror created..... a simple scene of a blood-soaked (ex-family member) now-turned Zombie walking slowly towards a lone person trapped in the corner of a basement evokes infinitely more tension and suspense than anything in this film.MILD SPOILER ALERT......The plot here is basically a mish-mash of elements tossed together ranging from vengeful spirits, old West Virginia relegious fanatisicm, overgrown cockroachs, super powerful humanoids, etc....Basically it all become comical after awhile.If the plot had stayed focused along the line of a "ghost town" destroyed by fire and a "crossover" visit, then that would have been cool.But what we get here instead is "fiery ghost town meets videogame DOOM with some Deliverance tossed in".... it all erodes into forgetability.A real shame.... based on previews (which are misleading as to storyline).... we thought this was going to be a winner.

You have to be kidding me !!This movie MUST really be a study in marketing and "bandwagon" thinking.This movie is not bad because of a low $10,000 budget.It is bad because ....... well, it's simply flat, lame, boring, silly and bad.Having heard so much hype about this movie, four (4) friend and I went to see this movie. We thought from what we had heard, that perhaps on a low budget somebody had managed to create a real classic in terror that would get into your psyche and make you think.When we walked out of the theater we were all looking at each other with a "You have to be kidding me" look on our faces.We felt like we had been ripped off by some marketing scam.Anybody and I mean ANYBODY over the age of six (6) years old who claims this movie was spooky or scared them in the least DESERVES to be made fun of !This was simply lame, boring and bad.We can't believe the reaction we heard about this movie is genuine.This film MUST be part of some psychology research experiment to test marketing and advertising methods.Do not believe anything you have heard about this movie being chilling or scary.Trust me .... walking out to your parked car in a New York City parking lot after dark is more scary than this movie.Seriously !

Ouch this was bad...........The story premise started out pretty good, the film production had a professional look........ BUT....... that is where the good news stops.Everything else about this film was horrible and destroyed the potential this had to be a good film.For example...1) What was with the choppy editing ? This over-used visual effect is annoying. We see the scene chop-edited end to end like a skipping record. A guy get thrown out a window and we see him break thru the glass - thru the glass - thru the glass - thru the glass in rapid succession.Almost every action scene uses this edit.2) Did any of you notice that Steagal was NOT involved in any of the action scenes ?A double was used for all the action/fight scenes and they edited in still shot close-ups of his face every 10 seconds to 'trick' the viewer into thinking it was Steagal... but it was very obvious as they kept using the same 3 relaxed facial shots over and over regardless of where he was located in the room, background, or what position he was in during the fights.3) What was that accent ? Cajun meets the Godfather ?it was so forced and faked that my wife and best friend watching the movie started laughing so hard they begged me to turn off the movie because they couldn't stand it any more.Steagal has certainly had some good films (UNDER SIEGE near the top) and some of his Direct to Video movies have been good entertainment.......... but Kill Switch was simply horrible ---- Although it COULD have been good if it was done seriously and not treated in a comical, campy manner that made it silly to try and watch.We gave up 50 minutes into the movie and ejected it.... we could not take any more.

Exactly why is this film called BOBBY ?If you are renting this DVD with the idea you are going to see a film about Bobby Kennedy, you will be very dissapointed.Instead what you get is a story of 22 assorted people who happen to be at the Ambassador Hotel the day of Kennedy's assassination.Except for a few archive clips of actual Bobby Kennedy speeches here and there popping up on TV screens, this film could just as well have been called "A Sad Day in 1968".So in that sense, some may feel the title of the movie is a little misleading.Truth be told, my wife and I could not stomach the film because instead of being a straightforward drama about that fatal day in 1968..... the film comes across as a thinly veiled modern day Liberal propaganda film trying to establish credibility by disguising itself behind the historical and legendary figure of Bobby Kennedy.Pretty shameful.I mean we get criticism of "hanging chads", "Illegal Mexican immigrants", "voters being kept from poll places", etc... and a score of other issues that were not really that big of a concern in late 60's America.(remember 1960's America was about Black civil rights, Hispanics were only 2% of the US population and was not a topic of discussion yet.... that started in the late 70s.)In summary, the producers of this film tried to FORCE a parallel between current events and 1968 by blurring the historical accuracy and differences between the two eras.A true and accurate docu-drama of Bobby Kennedy's last days was what we thought we were renting and would have made for a much better and tasteful film.

OK..OK.... let's face the factsThis movie is a thinly veiled "remake" of Risky Business for a new generation.The hooker in Risky Business is a Porn star here... the problem of the house being robbed and the car destroyed is replaced by $25,000 of school funds stolen here.... the dangerous pimp is replaced by a sleazy Porn movie producer.... the "plan" to get the money back is to film a porm movie as opposed to running a call-girl operation........ but obviously this movie is basically the Risky Business screenplay with a minor reworking.However, taken for what it is.... 90 minutes of harmless and mindless entertainment.... it is pretty good.It was much better than the other "serious" film we rented the same weekend..... GODSEND. Ugghhh now that was flat, lame and bad. A weak comparison to the OMEN series.That girl from the "24" Fox series is certainly growing up !

This film COULD have been an excellent independent zombie flick that did a better job of capturing the mood of foreboding doom IF the makers had done one thing differently.............. A word to modern filmakers........ STOP trying to generate excitement in films with that choppy, strobelight-like editing that is SUPPOSED to (in the minds of some) add tension, but instead makes watching the film annoying and detracts from the visual effectiveness of the film.

The reason for my rating of 4 stars is I evaluated these headphones in 2 different applications --5 stars for comfortable sound isolation when recording an instrument in a noisy environment.No, they are not as sound isolating as an in-ear headphone, but they also don't give you that "music inside your head" effect that in-ear monitors give you.3 stars for sound accuracy.For those who like to mix using headphones, I would caution against using these headphones unless you are comparing to a mix you like the sound of and can then do a side-by-side comparison during the mixing process.Why do I say this ?These headphones seem to be a bit heavy in the Bass and low mids and seem to have a drop off in treble starting around 6K.This is sometimes a common trait in closed headphones as compared to semi-open.This tends to give a bit boomy and muffled tone.Nothing extreme, but they will not have a flat and balanced tone for mixing like classics like the AKG 240 headphones or Yamaha NS10M studio nearfield monitors.Since the story behind these headphones involves them being designed by a drummer, this may explain this tone bias.

Okay..okay.....One must overlook the stange unrealistic sets and odd exaggerated use of color (NEVER is there a scene without pink or purple either in clothing, buildings, room colors, etc...)One must overlook the sometimes cheesy predictable plots, stiff dialogues and cornball humor.Okay.. one must also overlook the fact that this looks NOTHING like West Palm Beach Florida............One must also overlook the tight budget and fast shooting schedules that makes the plots predictable and sometimes even illogical with gaping holes....BUT despite all this... a chemisty in the show works to make it one of the 90's most entertaining and enjoyable "cop duo" partner shows around.It's like chocolate cake....... not full of nutrition or good quality calories, but enjoyable just the same !

Since so many people consider the original CONAN with Arnold to be a classic (even with some of the cheesy and campy scenes), you know the makers of this film were fighting an uphill battle to have the film be accepted.I was not really expecting much, but we rented it any way.I was surprised.It was much better than I expected.They tried to maintain a darker tone that was more consistent with the Howard books.I am sure most people will still regard the Arnold version of Conan to be a classic and this film will probably be forgotten quickly ........... which is kind of a shame, because is really is better than the harsher critics proclaim.

This film works like a play.Really no scenes as much as all the dialogue taking place in a trailer.It felt like a character study exercise for actors more than an actual film.With the main characters doing a great job with their acting and continuous dialogue.The opening sequence was a full rip-off of the opening credits for the TV show DEXTER.Bottom line -- impressive acting talents and character portrayals , but not really an enjoyable or interesting movie.P.S.What happened to Val Kilmer ?Years ago he was poised to be the next big thing, then he suddenly kind of just faded away.I think I will go look that up now that I am curious.

I was EXTREMELY impressed with the "quasi-realistic" computer animation style introduced and used by this movie.For that alone, I give the movie 6+ stars.Despite this, the movie itself lost our interest after about 30 minutes.Instead of any real adventure story, the movie felt like one "falling dominoes" or "fancy mousetrap" scene after another strung together.By "falling dominoes", I mean those scenes that are set up where ladders fall, throw a bucket in the air, dog lands in bucket, bucket floats down waterfall, etc.. etc...Instead of telling a story, the scenes BEAUTIFULLY RENDERED AS THEY WERE, simply felt like exercises in manipulating computer animation with as crazy and looney scenes as possible.At the end of the movie, I actually felt bad for not liking the movie more.I mean there is TONS of hard work and talent that goes into manipulating modern computers and pixels to create such a visually impressive movie.That deserves respect.How many nameless ans faceless people spent late hours working on this visually impressive piece of art.People will remember the names Spielberg and Jackson, but what about all those dozens of CGI guys behind them that REALLY did the hard work ?As it ends up, as impressive as the computer animation was .... the movie felt lifeless and dull.I would much prefer to see a detailed and in-depth documentary on the full process of how a movie like this is made from scratch.I actually think such a documentary would be much more interesting than the movie itself.

PLANET TERROR was good for what it was..... namely a zombie spoof film that paid homage to Drive-In films of the 1970s.Of course it was over the top and cheesy.The budget, special effects, and other film making aspects of the film were quite good which made me think to myself....... "Wow just imagine how good they could have made this film if they had used all these resources to make a serious horror/action film..... man they even had Savini to help them out"So in summary....... it was good for what it was, but I would have enjoyed it more if they used all those resources to make a serious version of the same basic screenplay idea.

Wes Craven was supposedly unhappy with this film after fights with the studio, rewrites, re-shoots, etc...It shows in the final product.What starts a an interesting film erodes into Hollywood formula mediocre hash.With less than 1/10th the budget, GINGER SNAPS was a much better modern pop-culture Werewolf film.It's a shame this movie could not have been made right... it showed lots of potential, but it jsut didn't come together successfully.When watching the movie it almost feels like 3 films edited together as a last ditch effort to get it released as the mood changes from serious horror, to camp, to silly stupid comedy (werewolves holding up middle fingers and similiar infantile jokes), etc..Would have been good if done in one continuous serious style of horror all the way thru.

This movie was well paced and will filmed and I would have probably given it a higher rating except for the following .....a) The plot was 100% predictable and played out EXACTLY as you probably guessed after the first 30 minutes. It's easy to see the whole story and know exactly how it is going to end only 30 minutes into it.b) I wish the music soundtrack was not so annoying. Maybe it is my age (close to 50) ... but an action movie like this does not feel right with some Techno-Dance THUMP THUMP Bass music that sounds like it belongs in a South Beach night club.c) It really is pretty dull and boring with most of the story being Hannah traveling on the road with a bunch of gypsy-like people ....... sadly this makes 75% of the movie feel like filler.It's a bit quirky and has a little of that weird "euro-artsy-fartsy" feel to it that unfortunately serves to prevent the movie being as intense as it could be.It comes across kind of campy.Actually as I write this review and revisit the movie in my head, I like it less and less, so maybe I had better end this review before I change my mind and make it only 2 stars.

Stallone deserves praise for taking the time and effort to see that the ROCKY series ends on a proper note and comes "full circle" instead of having an American Icon fade away in disgrace as would have been the case if we had been left with Rocky 5.In many ways this film is a "mirror" or an "opposite book-end" to Rocky I as we basically see a man who has come full circle in life with the similiar challenges only made different by the passage of time.Unrelated to the movie itself, Stallone also deserves credit for showing that "60 is the new 40" in today's society for people who are dedicated enough to diet and exercise.Not only does he look great for 60 in this film, he looks better than 50% of the population in their 30s.I also see a "need" for this film in todays' American society.In 1976-1977, when the first Rocky came out, America was at a lowpoint in terms of image, self-esteem, respect, etc....Much of this of course is due to one of our worst Presidents ever.... Jimmy Carter.Rocky became a mobilizing icon to remind Americans about dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and "never giving up".Thru the 80s, America refound itself, Reagan ended the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was torn down, etc...In other words, instead of being negative, America made things happen in the world !Now in late 2006, we have a similiar situation.Much of America has grown soft, fat, lazy, happy and stupid as a resultof having it too good for too long.People criticize those trying to take action to protect this Country from an impending crisis.(apparently 50% of our society has no knowledge of history or they would clearly see the importance of action TODAY in the Middle East before we get to the point England, France and Germany are facing already today).Getting to the point.... too many Americans today are apathetic, soft and are trying to rationalize "no action" as a way to live their lives in "cushy" ignorance of reality.Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and "never giving up" really means.Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong.Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD)."Yo, Aint so bad... hit me again"

LIBRARIAN-Spear of Destiny.They are both a bit "cheesey" but are a much needed and refreshing wholesome break from the constant stagnation being seen in Hollywood and on TV today.This is a "made for the family" type of movie .... sort of like a modernized Indiana Jones or Doc Savage for TV

This movie was better than expected with an original twist tossed in near the end. (even if you guess it about 5-10 minutes before revealed).It is strange that the father is so quick to defend the new orphan child and not his own family when strange things begin to happen, but they make this credible by portraying the father as a wimpy, useless father and husband.Great acting on the part of the young 13 year old actress who plays Esther in this film ........ she steals almost every scene she is in.

When an entire movie centers around a couple of pathetic idiots who can't get out of a locked house and are chased by a fat slob of a psycho killer with a hammer, my wife's comments say it all......."these victims are so stupid they deserve to die. They are too dumb to live".I agree with the others on here.... a terrible film

Nicole Kidman is excellent (as are the other cast) in this well done movie !Released in the wake of the "Sixth Sense"-type movies, it does not quite have the super twist surprise that 6th Sense does, but is it a great film and example of movie-making and acting at it's best.Now a part of our permanent DVD collection !

Dexter Seasons 1 & 2 are FIVE STAR shows all the way.Season 3 with Jimmy Smitts dropped to 4 stars as they perpetuated the storyline by having Dexter act out of character.Dexter almost became a secondary character that season.Now we look at this product ..... Season 4......What was the problem ??By the 4th episode it was easy to see the entire storyline for the full season, even a guess at the "surprising" ending.My wife thought I was joking when I told her after 4 episodes I had the whole season figured out.She made me write down my guesses and seal it an envelope.Months later when the season ended, she opened the envelope and said .. "Darn, you had it all right".Dexter is still a great show concept.But Season #4 suffered from what I call "Churning".Churning is where you run down the clock and burn up time by having nothing really happen except filler material and having the characters do stupid things to create plot twists.In Season 4, you can watch the first four episodes and the last 3 episodes and you have 99% of the story.The middle 5 episodes are filled with nothing but romantic interest side stories (that seem forced and un-natural).Additionally after the mistakes Dexter made (and should have learned from) in Season 3, this Season is in many ways a rehash of Dexter once again acting out of character and creating problems for himself (and others) by doing the dumbest things possible.All of which perpetuate the story and make simple problems much bigger than they needed to be.I like stories when a situation becomes difficult for characters because of tough unexpected circumstances that are heaped upon them.I get a bit dissapointed when writers stretch out a story simply by having the main characters do the dumbest and most illogical things possible -or- have them act totally out of character.Still, these comments are all relative.A 3-star Dexter is still much better than most other shows on TV.I have heard that the writers themselves were not too happy with Seasons 3-4, and did some serious discussions to get Dexter "back on track" and "back in character" for Season 5.So we may once again see a 5-star rating for the upcoming Season 5 ........... yeah !!!!!

If you MUST rent this movie, just watch the first 5 minutes... that is all that is good about this movie.After that it falls to the level of typical cheese and B movie lameness. (not to mention the subtle attempts at mimmicking certain Hitchcock Psycho images).Everything else you read on here about how bad the movie is about sums it up.Although DARKNESS FALLS was not a GREAT movie either, it is basically the same identical theme and plot line but is better done and more worthy of renting over this dissapointment.

I know this is a little late, but tonight for movie night we rented the 2nd Sherlock Holmes movie that so many people raved about.Ouch ... this was painfulAll 6 people at my home yelled out .. "GONG" about 30 minutes into it.Wonderful sets and wardrobe ......... but it was like slapstick humor.Too goofy, like a parody.We were waiting for Jerry Lewis and the 3 Stooges to jump out at anytime.It was NOT Sherlock Holmes, it was some comedy spoof.It seemed to be nothing but an endless romp of fight scenes done in s silly comical way.The whole group of us voted to eject it and stop watching it.

We loved BECKER and think the first three seasons (and half of season 4) are classic comedy gold.But now watching Season 4 again on DVD, I remember why our love for the show faded.Something was lost in the magic when Nancy Travis joined the show.THEN when both Regie and Bob were lost, that was the end.I don't know what it is, but we really hated the Nancy Travis character on this show and feel the chemistry of the cast fell apart after she joined.The DVD on demand plays fine although the main menu does not advance to the next show automatically , there is no PLAY ALL option and the discs sound a little louder than normal DVDs when spinning in the player

With it's new "never before seen" footage, this is one of the most compelling Third Reich documentaries I have ever seen.Instead of the usual official footage that has been used for year, this documentary is made more powerful by new footage from private collections, recently released archives and more .......... giving a much closer and personal perspective of this ear in history.Why only 4 stars ?To add dramatic effect, the producers often use choppy editing and cut scenes too short and fast.They also use fake digital melting film tricks and other jerky special effects to add a sense of mental unrest.Also, in between almost every scene where a new title appears they use the "distressed film" video effect that causes the words to jump erratically on the screen like some cheap horror movie.This happens about once every 30-60 seconds for the full 4 hours which gets annoying and distracting.The subject matter is heavy enough, it does not need digital video effect gimmicks to try and make it seem more eerie ... this kind of video trickery only risks adding a cheesy feel to what should be a very serious treatment.If you can overlook this abuse and over use of video effect gimmicks, this is a very compelling documentary about the rise and fall of Hitler ...... told from a SLIGHTLY different perspective.

CHEERS was a great TV classic that set the tone for all the comedies that followed.CHEERS will always be remembered as the comedy series that broke away from the formulas of old and ushered in a new era of style in the way comedies was done.The only reason I give Season Five 4 stars is because the series was a bit in a rut at this point, bogged down in the Sam and Diane = Marriage storyline that grew old and monotonous.If Shelly Long had not left the show when she did, CHEERS may have never become as great as it did.I liked Shelly Long in Seasons 1-4, but by the 5th season the Sam & Diane see-saw romance stories were getting a bit stale.With Diane's departure and the arrival the following season of Rebecca (Kirstie Alley), the writers were forced to move in a new direction and breathe new life into the series that took the show to even greater levels.

I love Iommi's work and thought his solo album IOMMI was overlooked years ago considering how good it was.In fact, IOMMI was MUCH, MUCH better than this FUSED album.Problem 1: The modern production saps the power out of Ioomi's trademark guitar tone and dominance. It has a washed out sound to the guitars with too many cute studio tricks tossed in.Problem 2: Glenn Hughes..... Sorry, I have never liked that nasal twanging sound he has when singing and unlike many I never found his voice to be a good match to Iommi's guitar styles in the past or now.FUSED is tons better than the crap most bands release now, but I dont listen to that stuff either.I gave away my copy of FUSED as I knew I would never want to listen to it anymore.On the otherhand, IOMMI solo album and DEHUMANIZER are two relatively newer Iommi albums that still sit in my car's CD changer.

This film was hyped everywhere as "the best horror movie of the year".Perhaps that is indeed an accurate statement if 2005 was a weak year for horror movies.As bad as Hollywood seems at times these days, it is still good to see the one business where the USA still leads the world is film-making.Most European films simply don't cut it, and this French film was worse yet.Yeah.. yeah.. there was some good gore scenes, but the "people stranded in the wood with a mad killer" plot basis is getting old and overdone.I suppose films must only be made by big city dwellers since they always portray the wilderness as a scary eerie place.Personally, I would rather spend the night in the woods with a psycho killer than walk down a back alley in New York or LA at 3:00 am in the bad section of town!It's hard to get worked up or too excited by horror films of this type.The key to a good horror movie is when you place yourself in the potential victim's shoes and realize it would be VERY hard to get yourself out of that situation.By contrast, horror movies get irritating fast when the story only continues due to the ineptness or stupidity of the main character.You know a horror film is missing the mark when your wife is picking up a book to read during the movie because she has gotten irritated at the movie after yelling at the screen 10 times... "Come on already just whack the slow fat redneck over the head and be done with it, that guy is not threatening... heck even I could kick HIS ass".When your wife is making those comments you can definatley tell the film-makers missed out on the scary part !!Now in the case of this movie, there was a "surprise" ending that may explain some of the above, but honestly as many reviewers on here commented, it seemed like an illogical "cheap shot" surprise ending thought up as a last minute rewrite...... kind of like those murder mysteries there you can't figure out who the murderer is (and for good reason), when at the end of the film they introduce some brand new character that was never part of the first 119 minutes of the movie.

This was a pretty good film on it's own but it could just as well have been given another title like "UNDERCOVER", since it really had virtually nothing to do with the Miami Vice franchise.I suppose the studios knew the name MIAMI VICE would help draw crowds, but there is only a passing similarity to the characters and image of the original series.

The original "When a Stranger Calls" ushered in alot of scary movie "tricks" still used in films today.This remake on the otherhand is dull, stiff, offers ZERO tension and really only causes the viewer to keep looking at the counter to see if the movie is close to over yet.Easily a film you can afford to skip with no need to worry you have missed anything.The attempts at building tension fall flat.A dud.

This is an interesting collection of Steve Vai's movie related music creations.Of course it is worth the price alone for the music from CROSSROADS, which many today still think is Vai's best single recorded work ........... kind of his ERUPTION so to speak.Speaking of CROSSROADS, at first listen I thought my memory was tricking me because songs like BUTLERS BAG sounded different than I remember from the movie.So I popped in the movie and watched/listened again compared to the versions on this CD.For the movie, they apparently edited the songs and removed 12 full measures during the first minute of the song around the A9 chord vamp.On this CD it is a section that involved some right hand tapping --- you can see in the movie Vai starting to play this sequence, but then the video cuts to the classic blue repeating cliche played in the high 17th fret A position.Actually I think the movie version is better as these extra 12 bars heard here on the CD get a little "out there" playing with the modes and seems to move a bit into some alien world.I think Vai gave us the full studio recording here as he originally recorded them.

I have played guitar for 25 years, own at least 10 guitars and have recorded CDs as well as spent a few years working with Yngwie Malmsteen.I bought one of these for something different when desiring to play Black Sabbath songs.My complaint ?This thing will NOT stay in tune.I have worked on the nut slots, tightened the tuners ...... but this thing still tends to go out of tune very easily which is very rare for a guitar with a fixed bridge.Honestly ... they tried to give you lots of features for your money with this guitar ...... but it really is more of a toy than a serious instrument.If not for the 24 fret feature ...... I would suggest most people who are serious about getting an Iommi sound to buy a real SG guitar and install the custom pickups yourself.Also for what it is worth ..... watch an recent concert footage of Iommi playing in concerts ..... he rarely uses the Gibson signature pickups.He is using old PAF and other pickups on his main guitars.It makes you wonder why ??

The death of film maker Tim Ince on William Randolph Hurst's yacht in 1924 has long been surrounded in mystery and is a longstanding Urban Myth.However, investigation into the transfers of money (potential payoffs ??) and other events surrounding this fateful weekend makes this story appear as though it may actually be more truth than legend.This is a delightful peek into 1920s America and Hollywood and is enjoyable to see.A bit on the light side as stylistic, but very entertaining.

This was better than many critics made it out to be.It would be good viewing for younger people who are weak on their WW2 and Hitler history to learn the basics of this historical event.I must agree with those who say Cruise was outclassed by the actors who surrounded him. He may also be at the disadvantage of being an American trying to play the part of the principal German character in the movie while many of the other actors were infact European or even German.All thngs considered it was worth watching once but not something I would ass to my DVD collection.On the other hand DOWNFALL is the absolute best film ever made covering the end of Hitler's reign and WW2.DOWNFALL is so good you forget you are watching a movie at times.

You know the old adage ....."No matter how good something feels, if you rub the same spot too long it ceases to be enjoyable and becomes highly annoying" ?SOURCE CODE proves the truth of this phrase.After about the fourth (4) "Groundhog Day" in this movie, we no longer cared about the characters, the parallel universes, the alternate realities or if the bombs exploded or not.The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....The initial curiosity and tension of the film got beat out of the movie thru repetition ....You get the idea ..SOURCE CODE was essentially an 8 minute movie repeated 12 times with MINOR variances each time to try and impart some pseudo-science , pseudo-psychology, pseudo- entertainment value ............ but then throws much of this development out the window during the last 10 minutes with what I assume was NOT the original intended ending, but some Hollywood executives forcing the typical "formula" ending unto the director under duress.I always feel bad when a movie does not really work, because I know how hard it is to be creative and keep coming up with ideas.Making an original story is not easy and good movie making is very difficult also.That is why great movies are often cherished by people ..... but, sadly SOURCE CODE was simply bland and forgettable.

The first 30 minutes of this film set a good dark creepy atmosphere, then just turned silly.The attempts at Scary simply were overdone to the point of becoming comical.My wife was laughing.Cusak's acting was good considering what he had to work with.Stephen King is one of the top horror writers of our generation and deservedly so, but he seems to have his own curse.......... meaning almost every attempt to translate his stories to the big screen fail.The premise of the film was good but it seems they tried too hard to use special effects and eye candy to create terror and thus it lost it's edge and became ho-hum.

Watching this film (did not see by choice, but because I lost a bet) was exactly what I expected.I am familiar with the book SEE NO EVIL written by ex-CIA operative (name escapes me now).Oddly enough, the movie seems to have very little in common with the book.I should have known what to expect with Clooney and Damon involved.One gets the impression the Hollywood producers bought the film rights to the book in order to add a sense of authenticity to their film ("based on a novel by a CIA operative who knows the truth firsthand").... but then after securing those rights, went ahead and made an anti-American propaganda film like they intended to do all along.It must be horrible to live with so much self-hatred, negativity and a mind that thinks EVERYTHING in the world is some massive scandal and conspiracy.This film helps demonstrate why there is a big difference in our society today between Democrats and Liberals.They are NOT the same.A democrat is a guy like Leiberman.A liberal is some misguided, borderline deranged nut like Howard Dean, Ted Kennedy and much of the Hollywood crowd who make films like this in an attempt to mold people's minds to their own agendas.Summary....If you have studied history, have worked in either intelligence, government and/or have connections {my uncle was FBI for 30 years and before retiring I did independent operations during Desert Storm) that can give you a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes, you will shake your head at this movie as yet another example of how simplistic and unrealistic a certain portion of our extreme left society thinks these days.On the otherhand, if your entire view of the world is limited by mind molding and stories you get from the mainstream media, you will probably praise this film as "telling it the way it is brother" !As though a Hollywood film produced and directed by a supposed ex-drug addict can be viewed as informational and accurate !Afterwards I learned this was made by the same creative minds who did TRAFFIC, which I also found to be a lousy film.Maybe because I get tired of people analyzing problems, discussing problems, studying problems and making a lifetime career of working on problems, instead of simply SOLVING them.To me, handling illegal drugs is an easy solution (If society really cared to), and that of course is executing all people found guilty of buying and/or selling illegal substances.. Period !!People seem appalled by the mention of this solution, but to me that's a symptom of how soft we have become.... we dont ever fix things today because people are unwilling to take the steps needed.If we are unwilling to do what must be done to fix things, then stop talking about them, because they are not going to go away on their own despite the wishful thinking of many unrealistic and idealistic softies in our society today.In all fairness, I went to this movie expecting not to like it, but that is not always a predicter of a bad review.A really good movie can win you over.Originally I was never interested in seeing SHAWSHENK REDEMPTION, DOOR TO DOOR or THE STRAIGHT STORY.... but all three (3) of those movies now rate a 5-star for me and are among my favorites.

Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage are great modern day actors ...... but unless this was a favor owed to somebody or a lost bet ........ how did they get sucked into doing this movie ?Ouch this was bad.Like others have commented, it is like watching an episode of World's Dumbest Criminals.I am not sure if this was supposed to be silly or suspenseful because the whole film comes across very goofy and comical.You can't take anybody seriously.It would be interesting to know the full story of how this film came to be because it seems like something must have gone wrong behind the scenes to create such a mess.

This film is wonderfully shot, includes subtle symbolism in the scenes (hint: look at the train station decorations and time on the clock near the very end of the movie) and is probably the most pure, simple and emotional movie I have ever seen.I don't understand why this great film was not promoted more and/or did not get a good solid American release. I would not even have known about it unless I saw it on the New Releases for Blockbuster. It was filmed in early 2008, released in Japan in August 2009 ..... then simply placed on the "Direct to DVD" market here in the USA. I never heard anything about this movie even being made until stumbling across it by chance luck.A great and well done movie like this deserved better promotion and press treatment. It is a shame because many people may miss out on this film.I can only guess that budget over runs and limited financing left no money in the budget for advertising after the filming was done ? Anybody know ?Or are American audience now only fascinated with fancy CGI visual effects "eye candy" and no story ?In either case ... This movie deserved and still deserves more attention !So on to the movie itself ...A tough guy like me does not usually get choked up over movies, but here is one I can recommend to you that will probably touch you.It is based on a true story from Japan ... although this version with Richard Gere has been shifted to USA.Basically this is the story if you don't already know it.WARNING SPOILER BELOW .......................................A college professor had a dog that was loyal to him.Each day it would follow him to the train station where he left for work.The dog would run around and do whatever all day long.But at 5:00 in the evening the dog was always back at the train station to meet his owner.This went on for years,One day the dog was waiting at the train station, but the professor never showed up.The professor had died of a heart attack at the school campus that day.For the next 9 years, the dog kept waiting and looking for it's owner at the train station everyday.Other people would try to take the dog home, but every time the dog would run away and return to the train station trying to wait for the professor.He became a local legend and the other people at the train station each day would bring the dog food and water to take care of him since the dog refused to leave his post.Eventually 9 years later the dog died, still sitting at the train station watching the people get off every train, looking for his owner.Today in Japan where this really happened they have a bronze statue of the dog sitting in the train station as a tribute to that kind of loyalty......................................END OF SPOILERI suppose the reason I found this particular story touching enough to even put a lump in my throat was two reasons ..1) I have always thought there is something innocent and pure about an animals loyalty and affections that is rare in humans.2) When I was young and walking to elementary school, my friend had a dog named Pal.He would follow us when we walked the 2 miles to school.He would wait for us all day long.I can remember sitting in classes and looking out the window and seeing that dog under a tree looking at the school building and waiting for us to get out.When we got out of class in the afternoon he would be all excited and come running to meet us and follow us home again.This went on for around 2 years as I recall.But one day when we got out of school, the dog was all excited to see us and came running across the parking lot.We started yelling "NO PAL. STOP"But it did not help.Pal ran in front of a school bus in the parking lot.Now being older and wiser, I look back at this story from childhood and think ..........Yes, it is a cute story about boys and their dogs growing up together.But the real world is not the 1800 or early 1900s of farmhouses, dirt roads and horse & buggies anymore.The world is an urban , mechanized jungle that is dangerous for loosely roaming animals.If people really care about their animals they should not let them run around loose all day long to get hit by cars or other dangers.This is one of those rare movies you see in life that will leave an impression.Well done to everybody who worked on this project !

This SHOULD have been a compelling story.Unfortunately the overuse of tricky editing, and video gimmicks to try and create a "disturbing" feel of uneasiness instead only made the movie seem detached, artsy, unreal.As the film went along the odd behaviour of the characters that I think we intended to try and generate some feeling of creepiness or terror instead made the movie seem too much like an avante garde film.I think we would have liked this better if it was filmed with a realistic feel instead of an artsy symbolic surreal "mood enhancing" feel.We simply didn't care about any of the characters or even the victims by the time we were 30-40 minutes into the film and took it out of the DVD player, not really caring to see how it ended.My wife summarized this film best in my eyes, her comment...."This is the kind of thing that could only happen in the minds of a Hollywood urban mindset. Anywhere else in the country, if Mr. Meat Train came at you with his meat hook and cleaver, Average Joe American with his concealed weapons permit would pull out his 45 and stop him dead in his tracks".

This COULD have been a much better movie, but suffered due to 2 problems...1) It was told in the reverse timeline whereas we see the ending and then have the story told to us that leads up to that ending.It seems this ALWAYS weakens a movie as compared to telling a story in actual sequence although "artsy" filmakers love to show off their editing skills in this way.2) The story is told in a court room setting.With the joke our legal system has become today, if you really want to sap the life out of a story, have it told thru the eyes of a bunch of lawyers.I think this could have been a MUCH better film if screenplayed in such a way that we saw the events unfold as they happened and never even got to the court room drama part at all !The court battle between lawyers became the center point of focus with the actual historical events (or variation thereof) relegated to a backdrop story.

My wife and I dislike the &quot;typical&quot; popcorn fluff movies that come out of Hollywood these days, preferring instead something that makes you think about your own life's experiences and such.Having said that, you might think we would have liked NORTHFORK, unfortunately this is one of those &quot;artsy-fartsy&quot; type movies where the writers and directors go out of their way to be strange just for the sake of being strange without really ever putting anything to celluloid that draws you in or is memorable.I must confess, we tried watching this movie 3 times and never got further than 50 minutes or so into it.... just couldn't stand it anymore.Feel like getting introspective and deep ?Go sit outside late tonight and stare up at the stars pondering the origins and meaning of life... you will probably find this to be more entertaining passage of 2 hours of your life.

While RESIDENT EVIL and TOMB RAIDER were pretty good successes at bringing the video game to the big screen...... HOUSE OF THE DEAD and now ALONE IN THE DARK are failures.......... however... this film ALONE IN THE DARK is he worst failure as it has ZERO redemming features and must be an attempt to bring some new version of the ALONE IN THE DARK game to the movie screen because the ALONE IN THE DARK game I played on my PC years ago (ten years maybe ?) had no resemblance to this plot line.This movie adaption of ALONE IN THE DARK seemed like a mish-mash of Alien, Matrix, Invasion of Body Snatchers, Starship Troopers, a bad Zombie movie and Predator all attempted to be stirred into the same pot to magically come out a masterpiece.Instead it's a terrible mess of a movie.Seriously.... DO NOT spend 2 hours of your life on this movie..... do something else instead.

This film has fine writing and acting.So why did I not like it ?It essentially spends 2 hours showing the worst of human behaviour in our modern day Urban environments.The older I get, the more I am repulsed and disgusted with places like New York or Los Angeles.Let me live in the middle of 4,000 acres of land where I don't have to see modern, "civilized" society very often.So maybe the movie deserves a higher rating since it does a great job showing how miserable life can be in large urban areas.Ughhh ... it must be horrible to have to live this way.Crooked cops, miserable lives, dirty streets, foul language, con artists, scammers, stoolies and pigeons ........... this film has it all.

Despite good acting performances this film deserves NONE of the accolades it received.... it's basically RUBBISH for the simple sake of trying to be controversial.Forget racial tension issues... all the characters in this film deserve what happens to them NOT because of the supposed "deep racial expose" reasons the film is supposed to be so praised for representing.... instead they deserve the misfortune they receive due to erratic stupid behaviourm, being hot-headed, mouthy and emotional instead of logical and composed.They all create their own problems mostly due to poor manners and behaviour independent of racial identity.

Ever since the success of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, it seems every budding independent film company is releasing every independent Zombie and Zombi-like film they can get into distribution.So far 95% of what we have seen these past 2 years has been pretty bad.So perhaps DEAD MEN WALKING does not really deserve 4 stars.... (maybe 2-3) , but BY COMPARISON to the 115 other independent Zombie releases over the past 24 months, this one gets it's 4-star rating.With a slight plot twist on the usual Zombie theme, this film does a great job at BUILDING the tension and capturing that feeling that things are getting more and more out of control with each passing minute !It is this important feature of Zombie films that makes them great and so many movies have lacked these past 2 years.Sure the ending was no surprise... 20 minutes into the film you KNEW how it would end... BUT the growing chaos and escalation of chaos and gore is what this film captured properly.I'm not a fan of the "choppy" editing used by young directors these days, but the film is still good for a late night rental.

Geeezzz... this is an infuriating film.More Hollywood propaganda rubbish.In this case, the character portrayed by Kate Beckinsale is a reporter who reveals the identity of a secret CIA operative.This creates the primary conflict and tension of the movie between the Government who wants to know her source and the reporter who stands by the position that she will NOT reveal her source under any circumstances.This film attempts to send the message that we should respect people who stand up for their principles against even the toughest force and scrutiny.I have seen many reviews praising the reporter in this movie for fighting the officials and refusing to reveal her sources regardless of the political and security implications.Actually taken at face value, I AGREE with this noble position of standing by your beliefs and principles against all odds and not giving into pressure ............................... HOWEVER, you better be sure you are standing up for the RIGHT beliefs.What this film chooses to ignore (or at least downplay) is the vital concept that WITH RIGHTS COME RESPONSIBILITIES.Just because one may feel they have the right to do a certain thing, does not mean they should do that thing.In this case we have a reporter who feels so darned strong about the idea of breaking a big story and revealing the identity of a CIA operative that she seems to give no regard for the consequences, security risks created, the danger to the CIA operative and family, and the string of events this reckless, irresponsible reporting creates.All this reporter cares about is "break the story" and "I will not reveal my sources".But hey this accurately reflects the arrogant attitude of the Press and News Media today who seem to feel they can pretty much do anything they please to mold public opinion and don't need to answer to anybody. No surprise Hollywood jumped to make this film and Alan Alda stars in it.Since this was a work of ficton (but based very much on recent real world events), my wife made a comment while watching this film about combining 2 fictional characters.....Her comment was ......... "They need to hire Jack Bauer for a few hours to come over and convince this piece of crap reporter to talk".

With fine casting, great costumes and a big budget; this COULD have been a great Sherlock Holmes movie.But it fails to deliver.Why ??It did not take the character of Sherlock Holmes seriously ......... instead this movie went for a silly, almost spoof like feel.Remember how they ruined the Wild Wild West movie ?This Sherlock Holmes film adaption looked and felt like the very bad Will Smith version of Wild Wild West.

This film seems to be the ultimate expression of "artsy fartsy" film-making.I assume this was a film made in Hollywood by Hollywood and about Hollywood for them to self-diagnose and poke fun at their own negativity, liberal bias, shallow existences and sad state of affairs today.To anyone else watching it, you will probably hit the "eject" button after 30-40 minutes and ask ... "Why would anyone waste the time, energy and effort to put together crap like this ?"Time is to short to waste on people who are perpetually negative and hate themselves as not only the characters but apparently the makers of this film are themselves.

Bicentenial Man is a far better choice of movies if one has an interest in this basic plot premise.This movie never goes beyond the most basic of premises and never pulls you in.No surprises... within 10 minutes you already know the whole film.With some movies, you sometimes get pulled in, emotionally involved and almost forget it is only a movie... NOT IN THIS CASE.AI is so stiff and artificial you simply never care about any of the characters or what happens to them.With all due respect to the hard work people must have spent on effects and scenes for this movie, it suffers from the common Hollywood ailment these days......... 95% special effects and 5% story telling.If you want to spend 3 hours on human studies... rent and watch Bicentinial Man and the Straight Story back to back, but I can not recommend this movie at all.

There is alot of independent garbage being released these days, but GIRL IN THE BASEMENT is an excellent example of what can be done with a storyline, reasonable acting talent and no need for special effects, even on a low, low, low budget.Hollywood should study this film to remind themselves that good filmaking does not mean 90 minutes of CGI animation and 3 minutes of plot/storyline...... but an interesting story that draws you end wanting to see what happens next should be the core of the movies, and effects are just icing on the cake.

For some reasons, very few Steven King stories get well translated to the screen.The BEST is probably SHAWSHANk REDEMPTION by farGreat movie !!!But almost every other King story that gets turned into a movie (including this one) simply fail.Could not make it to the end.Just did not hold our attention at all.

SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent dark humor !It pays excellent homage to Romero's flicks.Oddly enough, although this is a comedy (or spoof) of Zombie films they actually do better job creating an atmosphere of doom and have better looking/acting Zombie scenes than most of the recent "serious" Zombie films out there.I almost wish while they had the crew together making this film, they made 2 movies... one being Shawn of the Dead and the other being a serious horror Zombie film with the same scenes, make-up, acting. etc...

Phantom has never been my favorite Broadway Show (I liked Jeckyl and Hyde), since I found the repeat of songs and themes in Phantom to get monotonous after awhile...... however...I like this movie adaption better than any of the stage shows I have seen.Newcomer Emmy Bossum is a REAL TALENT.If she can grow up with a level head and avoid the pitfalls of Hollywood, she can be great as she grows up.Her vocal talents were PHENOMENAL.Only criticisms, which are minor..... the film was a bit long and dragged at one point and the casting of the Phantom himself was the weakest casting as his vocal abilities were not up to par to the other performers............. However, all in all an excellent job done bringing this to the screen.

I realize this was based on a fantasy novel and was not a 100% pure Tim Burton creation, however BIG FISH misses the boat.Lavish production and great cinema techniques can't save this film from being just a random mish-mash of fantasy dream elements strung together in the semblance of a story.There is no empathy for characters and the story just gets old real quick.After about an hour you just want to turn it off and go do something else as the movie does not &quot;suck you in&quot;.I get the impression the original creator for BIG FISH has spent their life with a notebook by their bed and whenever they wake up in the middle of the night from a dream, quickly mkes notes about the dream before they forgot them.Then years later took that notebook of random dream elements and tried to weave a story around them.My wife and I waited for this movie with anticipation but were deeply dissapointed.One always hates writing a bad movie review because it is clear how much work and effort went into making it..... but like they say &quot;There are no E's for effort in the real world... the only thing that matters is the final result&quot;.Despite the hard work and effort that went into making this movie (which I can respect)... it is simply forgetable and not entertaining.

Of all the early 80's teenage exploitation films, SPRING BREAK was the best !It's just simple fun with enough hints of drinking and sex to be cute and not overboard and blunt like today's more coarse and harder edged comedies that leave nothing to the imagination.The movie does fall apart at the end a bit and become too much of a Slapstick Comedy.And of course the skin-suited lead singer of the girl's band was the perfect image of a hot girl for many 18-21 year old guys back then ........ heck she still looks hot watching the DVD today !!!For people like me who have actually lived in South Florida for 30+ years, this movie also stands as a sort of documentary of a bygone era. The South Florida seen in Spring Break is long gone.In the 70s and until the mid to late 80s, South Florida was the place Americans from the Northeast moved to retire.once you were outside the cities of Fort Lauderdale or Miami, the area actually had a rural feel with orange groves, fields of cattle and horse ranches.If you ventured down to South beach you would find older retirees who would tell you their stories from WW2.Basically South Florids was a tropical paradise that got a little wild during the annual Spring Break season.That South Florida is long gone.In the years since the movie SPRING BREAK was made, heavy immigration has caused the population of South Florida to increase by about 2 million people.The massive influx and growth of Hispanic immigrants has changed the culture as people of Latino heritage and ethnicity have become the new majority.... making up 65% of population in the area today.This radical ethnicity shift has changed the culture and social climate of the area.The "retired american" atmosphere has been replaced with a feeling that the area is more like the Banana Republics we find to the South.... or like the urban vibe of Los Angeles. (yuk)The South Beach area as we all know is no longer the home of retirees but is instead the new Sodom and Gommorah on Earth with 24/7 drugs, clubs and crime.Another radical cultural change.No longer is South Florida the #1 destination for retirees. In fact, retirees and many other longtime residents like me who have lived in the area for 30 years or more are leaving (or making plans to leave).So seeing SPRING BREAK is like stepping into a time machine and remembering the South Florida we used to love so much ....... a South Florida that is now long gone.No time period is perfect ... but in many, many ways... America was a better place in the 80's ......South Florida DEFINATELY was a better place in the 80s !

This independent film does with a $500,000 budget what many Hollywood films fail to do today.... tell a story.While Hollywood has sacrificed stories and plots for special effects and CGI, OPEN WATER tells a REAL STORY about human fear, tragedy, etc...Anybody who is unable to watch this film, imagine themselves in the same situation and realize the creeping fear that would grow on you while you floated out in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night with sharks taking stabs and bites at you is in denial or can't relate to real terror as related to the silly make believe stuff in most horror films.OPEN WATER does it's job well and anybody claiming it is weak and does not stir a feeling of impending doom needs to go put on a wet suit and hitch a ride with an incompentent dive boat operator so they can live thru the same experience themselves.To summarize...If you are the type of person who needs lots of eye candy, big explosions, fancy special effects and CGI sharks that are 300 feet long with human intelligence, you will not like this film at all.This is NOT a film that you mindlessly watch and go "oohh and aaghhh" at the cool special effects.THIS is good storytelling with no need for fancy special effects and fluff.It tells a story based on the way things happen in real life to real people.The key to appreciating this film is putting yourself in the water with this couple and imagining what YOU would do in the same situation.You can't swim to shore, it's 27 miles out against the current.Passing boats (what few there are) can neither hear your yells or see your arms waving in distress.You of course have no food or water with you and you will need to survive the night floating in the middle of the ocean, in pitch black conditions with sharks bumping and stabbing at you beneath the surface.It seems today our society has 2 types of movie viewers..... those that only go for the special effects and those that actually like a good story.I have found myself growing tired of the "all fluff -no substance" high budget films Hollywood has been cranking off the assembly line in recent years.(examples: WILD WILD WEST, SIGNS, CATWOMAN, DAREDEVIL, etc...)Recently films like DAY AFTER TOMMORROW wasted millions and millions on special effects only to ruin the movie with the typical "hollywood storytelling formula" that is like the formula used in all those $100 Million plus films anymore.Flashy, visually stunning.... mind numbing fake, silly and stupid.It is almost as though the special effects teams have taken over the studios and sent the writers home.Over the past few years I have found the best movies to be those with great stories and virtually no special effects..... (examples: STRAIGHT STORY, DOOR TO DOOR-Story of Bill Porter, OPEN WATER, SLINGBLADE)OPEN WATER is not a Jaws or related "monster animal" type horror movie meant to entertain teenagers or mindless masses.If you expect tons of gore or a bloodfest, forget this movie.If you expect non-stop action and adventure, you will not like this movie.If you appreciate a film that depicts a real life story with real life people and you can mentally place yourself in their shoes, then you grasp the essence of this film and can appreciate it greatly.

Great acting from Naomi Watts.Fair to medium acting from Sean Penn (suffers from some excess). He usually does better.The story is of course loosely (VERY LOOSELY) based on recent events.The film suffers from the "Sean Penn Fanatical Preaching Obsession" he seems to have fallen into in recent years.He is so consumed by some of his political views he can't see straight at times it seems and it adversely affects his movie making.It seems he is only concerned with making political propoganda films these days at the exclusion of all else.That is fine if that is all he is interested in now, but don't be surprised if fewer and fewer people get too motivated to see his movies.I imagine that despite the good acting, this movie will go un-noticed and fade away into obscurity without too much attention or discussion.

I will keep this short since so many other people have made excellent comments on this series, and thus I would only be repeating their words.We never saw MAD MEN on TV, we only just now rented the first season on DVD.Oddly it was one of those new shows we saw advertised once years ago, but then never heard or saw anything more about it. We never even came across it by accident turning channels over the past 3 years.But the people working on this show deserve great praise for bringing the early 1960s alive !!Sometimes you forget you are watching a recreation of the 60s and feel like you are really watching something from that era.Much of the show's initial charm rests in it's nostalgic recreation of the culture of the era ........ we can also get a chuckle by seeing products featured on the show we remember from our younger days.The only small critique I may make is the storylines sometime move at such a slow and agonizing pace it gets a little boring.Despite the praise above, I must confess after 2 seasons, we have lost all interest in the show.I suppose it cant' be helped being a time period drama, but it started to feels like nothing more than a daytime Soap Opera but set in the 60s.Maybe the unique novelty of being so authentically set in the 60s made it feel special for 2 Seasons ....... but now it just plods along like an episode of "As The World Turns".So we went from LOVING the show to not caring to watch the remaining episodes or the current new season on AMC.

Take some young independent film makers who apparently have no science background and zero understanding of physics and engineering.Add an American public that has grown up in an era of Hollywood film fantasy.Throw in a potential fan base of people who love THE GLOBE magazine, think Jim Morrison is still alive in Paris, Hitler is cloning himself in Brazil, Elvis is still alive today in hiding and hundreds of other conspiracy theories.Stir in a group of people who live a miserable life, have low self esteem and need to feel like they belong to some kind of movement to gain self respect and social connectivity.Mix in some people who live their life and make opinions based on logic and emotion instead of science, logic and fact.The end result ?This "cough cough" Documentary and the hordes of people who latch on to this Conspiracy theory almost like it's a religious cult experience.But then again we live in a strange modern world where we have cell phones and satellites ........ but also Palm Readers on every other street corner and Horoscopes in the newspapers.

A great comedy series like WINGS deserves a better release than this.The Video Quality is blurry, washed out and very fuzzy.Unlike HOGANS HEROES and other CBS/Paramount TV series that have finally been released on DVD lately with EXCELLENT video quality... it appears they used some low quality prints or even VHS copies of old shows to make the DVD transfers here on WINGS.I give the series 10 stars !!! but the poor DVD transfer lowers the rating to a 4 since they are hard to watch with this substandard release.

When we first learned of this movie, were were interested in seeing it .........Directed by Ron Howard (that is good )Kevin James we love his comical approach from KING OF QUEENS)Winona Ryder and Jennifer Connelly are also always good.Our one hesitation was Vince Vaughn, we have never really understood how he made it in Hollywood.But with a promising plot premise, we rented THE DILEMMA.If you have read all the other 1-2 star reviews, there is nothing I can add.Everything they said is accurate.Pretty bad.Despite the individual great talents involved in this movie, it was not interesting, not funny, and was an effort to sit thru.Maybe it's like ingredients in a kitchen .....Cayenne pepper is greatCocoa is greatCurry is greatTomato paste is greatLemon juice in greatBut combine them together, and it doesn't work.Perhaps one problem here is I don't really see a DILEMMA in this film , which is what the whole conflict and tension of the film is supposed to be based upon ------------------You learn your best friends wife is cheating on him.Of course you tell him -- and I would hope he would do the same for me.Unpleasant to deal with ? YESBut ignorance is not bliss.Always live true and honest and you don't have "dilemmas" in life.So I don't feel the "dilemma" was really a strong enough premise to build a movie upon.So what we end up with is an aggravating movie where a guy messes his life up simply as the result of a bunch of ridiculous slap-stick kind of actions that would not happen if the guy would have simply spent 30 seconds to tell his friend what he saw and be done with it.Too preposterous to appreciate or relate to.

We usually like the movies Dennis Quad appears in.He is one of those actors who does not immediately come to mind for most people, yet he has had a very busy career with many good movies.Horsemen is NOT one of them.This film feels like an editing chop job where the weakness and predictability of the story is trying to be disguised by the bizarre and macabre.Also the Asian girl who constantly teases and plays with Dennis Quad is supposed to be creepy and haunting. Instead she is simply annoying and irritating.Everytime she was on the screen toying with Dennis Quad and refusing to answer questions, I was thinking to myself - Call Jack Bauer from 24 and let him spend a few hours with her. She will tell you what you need to know.I don't know much about the background of this movie but something tells me they ran into problems making it or had their budget cut short and had to jam it together at the last minute.Whatever happened, the potential of the movie was lost.Over the top visual violence was used to make up for weak story and unfortunately you could see the "twist" coming only 30 minutes into the film.Basically a train wreck of a film.Watch an episode or two of Criminal Minds on TV and enjoy a better 90-110 minutes.

The "surprise ending" of this movie was telegraphed pretty early in the film .. so that kind of killed the suspense factor.Otherwise this could have been a much better film considering the acting talent, great photography and overall mood and tone they were able to create.But in the end, something just doesn't come together and give this movie the spark it could have had.One redeeming feature of the film ..... if you are a young man who likes Christine Ricci, you will get LOTS of opportunity to see more of her in this film.She spends 75% of the movie walking, sitting and laying around nude.Since she is cute, you can't find any fault with that !What struck me as the most eerie in this film was how Liam Neeson made this movie so near the time of his own wife's death.It is the same strange feeling when you see Christopher Reeve's last movie where he played a paralyzed cop and weeks later was of course really paralyzed.Or seeing John Wayne in the Shootist playing an old gunslinger trying to die in peace from cancer when we know that in real life he was battling cancer when he made that film.

My wife and I grow more and more impressed everytime we see Nicole Kidman and her widening range of acting ability.She seems to be doing at least 4 movies per year now ranging from comedy to tragedy...In our minds she has far surpassed her ex-husband (Tom Cruise) in the talent and acting department.Does she ever have time to have a homelife anymore with all the films she is doing ??But in BEWITCHED, Nicole is the only thing worth watching.... the remainder of the film is a total ZERO and a pain to watch.I had heard of Will Ferrell but never seen anything of his before now.... Ugghh... the guy is not funny.BEWITCHED the movie is a ZERO, Nicole Kidman is a FIVE.... bringing this movie experience to an average of 2.5

OK......... right off the bat, we normally LOVE psychological thrillers that make you think as opposed to mindless "6 kids in the woods getting slashed" type garbage.However SUBLIME fails on many levels....1) You know what the story is going to be 15 minutes into the film, so there is no element of surprise as the end develops.2) SPOILER ALERT..........................................................................................................The "dream"/"hallucination" (trying to not spoil too bad) scenes lose all creepiness because they are simply silly and stupid as opposed to frightening.3) All the characters are so odd, you really never care for George, his wife, his kids or anybody for that matter.All in all it came across as a movie trying to be very "artsy-fartsy" and trying to create mystery by editing together random and erratic hallucinatory sequences simply for the sake of being confusing as opposed to being intriguing storytelling.We were suckered in by the fact that one of the Producers of the TV show "24" was involved in this project.But that did not help this film at all.

HELLBOY features great cinematography and film-making elements and has a GREAT first 30 minutes.... but after that it just sort of plods along as a half-hearted mix of comedy, drama, lovestory, hero comic story.I was not familair with the cult popularity of the HELLBOY comic before this movie.In general I don't like the way Hollywood throws so much COMEDY into hero movies.I would like to see a &quot;comedy free&quot; Hero adaption one day.It seems Hollywood likes to toss comedy into every type of movie these days... Horror, Action, Hero, etc...It's a good rental and is better than many films these days.I respect the work and effort that went into making the film, BUT I will probably never watch it again or add it to my permanent DVD collection.It just didn't grab me enough to watch again or to remember.

I have been making pizzas and other high gluten flour recipes at home for many years.Recently when I was unable to get any High Gluten flour locally, I ordered this online.Yes, it was pretty good and as would be expected works better for pizza doughs than normal "AP" flour (note -- don't expect much if you try to make pizza dough with plain all purpose flour - Yuk).However, I feel I get much better results from King Arthur High Gluten flour.Better taste, texture and rise.

We really thought this was a well done film in the Hannibal Lector saga.In fact, I have to confess I never really saw the fascination with the original "Silence of the Lambs".I always felt that film was kind of bland and never understood how it became such a craze. Perhaps I will watch it again sometime soon now and see if I like it better all these years later.But as I sit here writing this today, I would have to say I found this new "prequel"-- HANNIBAL RISING to be a more entertaining and intriguing film than the original that started it all.

This is probably a good "WARNING" movie for parents to watch if they have teen kids in today's culture.But otherwise, despite the advertised claims of being "Based on a True Story" it was yet another "loosely based combination of dozens of cases" filmed in the dreaded Blair Witch style that cheapens the potential of the film.Shot as a standard film I think it would have been more powerful ......... as it is, the Blair Witch style of filming lessens the movie and makes it seem a bit goofy and non serious.

WINGS will always be one of our favorite TV comedy series of all time (alongside Hogans Heroes, Cheers, Seinfeld and King of Queens).WINGS was a show that had a pure charm and good quirky stories without always needing to rely on "sex jokes" like so many modern TV comedies (like 2 and a half men)As a show, this rates 5 starsThe reason for the 4 star rating ?The video quality of this DVD set is quite blurry and fuzzy.I realize these were filmed on Videotape in the early 90s and not filmed on higher quality 35mm or higher end HD videotape like today, but compared to other series we have on DVD like Cheers, this set of WINGS episodes have a sub par video quality.In fact, it almost looks like some of the shows were transferred from VHS tapes.I don't know if there are better First Generation Master copies of WINGS locked away in a vault somewhere in Hollywood, but we would LOVE to have a better quality collection of this great series (uhmm .. well all except the last season)

Seeing the final season of WINGS again after all these years reminds me of what I always felt was a strange mystery about the show............ that mystery being ... "What the heck happened behind the scenes in the final season ?"My wife and I have a collection of classic TV shows on DVD that we love and would rather watch 100 times over compared to much of the crap on these days. These include our favorites...... WINGS, CHEERS, SEINFELD, HOGANS HEROES, BECKER, STAR TREK TOS, etc......But this final season of WINGS always seemed very strange.You know how sometimes a show goes off the air and years later a reunion episode is done -or- they try to bring back the series and it feels wrong -- as though the actors could not connect with the vibe of their old characters ?(think some of the Brady reunion shows where in their attempt to recapture the feel of their old characters they end up becoming their own spoofs).WING'S final season seems that way.Of course the stories were just silly and over the top for most of the last season (episodes like the Vacuum Cleaner episode are just painful to watch). This is the fault of the writers.But in addition to this some of the key actors really overplayed their parts and seemed out of character compared to earlier episodes. This is especially true of Tim Daly and the way Joe behaved in most of the final season's episodes. Helen was also over animated most of this last season.Brian, Casey and Roy seemed to stay in character.WINGS is still among our top 5 shows of all time and of course in no form of art or work can the same standard be maintained forever.All things in life have their birth, peak period, decline and eventual departure. TV shows are no different in that regard.We will continue to watch WINGS over and over many times in our lives in the future, although I think Season 7 will not come out of the DVD case very often.It would be interesting to know something about what was going behind the scenes during this time, as the changes in this last season were very unusual and noticeable.

I know I would have liked this series better if it had been given more time on the air.Just as it was finding its stride and becoming interesting, it was cancelled.It never got a full chance to develop until the last 4-5 episodes.It had great actors like Harvey Kietel and Gretchen Moll.The older I get, the more nostalgic I get for certain things from the 70s(I have a 1973 Porsche 911T)MAD MEN has been a big success revisiting the 60s, but LIFE ON MARS failed after one season while taking us back to the 70s.What happened ?What made one so successful and the other fail so quickly ?Apparently much of America rapidly lost interest in this show (thus the quick cancellation)I noticed that I warmed up slowly to this series.In fact, after the first 3-4 episodes I almost stopped watching.But I kept watching and I am glad I did, I seemed to enjoy the show more as the season progressed.My gut feel ?I think if this show had been able to continue on to Season 2, Season 3, etc.... that I would have liked it more and my ratings would have been higher (4-5 stars)The show did not start with a BANG from episode 1 ... like the series Walking Dead did ...... but instead LIVING ON MARS started a little slow and gradually built momentum .Unfortunately the series was cancelled right when it was getting up to full speed and becoming interesting.I have tried the British version which so many people say is actually the better (and original) version of the show ...... but I could not get into it.But to be honest, I often have problems feeling a connection to British TV shows for some reason.

The first GINGER SNAPS movie became somewhat of a cult classic with it's unique blend of horror and dark humor.It was one of the best small budget independent films released in years and I gave it 5 Stars !!!Ginger Snaps 2 on the otherhand falls flat in 2 regards.....First... the pacing of the story just drags along with no real heightening of tension or drama.It starts at one pace... moves at one pace and then ends at that same pace with no real building of tension or drama or sense of impending doom.It just plods along.Second.... the ending !!Yuk.. simply stated... the ending is not a fitting ending for the character of Bridgette who after 2 films eclipses her sister Ginger from the first film.The ending pretty much makes a trite summary of her whole ordeal and is very, very anti-climatic and dissapointing.Ginger Snaps 1 is a DVD we will probably watch time and time again here at the house.Ginger Snaps 2 will probably never see the inside of my DVD player again. Simply not entertaining or compelling enough to sit thru and watch again.I will say though the acting and direct to video filmography is all top-shelf professional and commendable.It's the screenplay and treatment that brings this film down to 3/5 stars.

I was one of those who did not care much for this movie.Based on all the hype leading up to the release, I was expecting a new breakthrough in Special Effects that erased the distinction between reality and animation.Yes, the animation was interesting.... but in no way realistic.Instead the movie felt like being inside a video game.The 3-D was an impressive technology, but for me a story is more important than eye candy, and AVATAR was simply a rehash of Pocohauntus with some subtle modern day political preaching tossed in by James Cameron.So I respect the work that went into making this film.That effort and hard work deserves respect and I would never take that lightly.AVATAR served as an impressive showcase for some new 3D camera technology, but as a movie it left me flat and disinterested.Certainly nothing I would ever care to watch again.In fact, I was so dissapointed by this film I actually walked out of the theatre after about 75 minutes and decided to go SCUBA diving instead that afternoon.

We tried to watch this movie twice, but after about 30 minutes or so we were simply so bored and disinterested, we simply gave up.

I think HURT LOCKER would have been very good if it had been filmed authentically as a genuine documentary with a crew following around actual military personnel.As it is, it has a very synthetic and unrealistic "movie" feel to it.I am sure other ex- military people will agree.

We are Romero fans.I should clarify that to say we are fans of the first three (3) "DEAD" series of Zombie movies.Since then, each new Zombie treatment from Romero has been worse and worse.With this film, even Romero's usual commentary about mankind and society seems off base.Maybe he has lost touch, but not only is the film bad, but his attempt at a deeper meaning misses the mark here also.The acting is bad. The story is silly. The effects are poor. The message is flawed. The zombie attacks are stiff.There is no tension, no suspense, no feeling of impending doom, you care nothing for the main characters, it plods along with no energy.Nothing in this film works.Romero still deserves much respect for effectively creating the modern Zombie movie ....... but it is looking like he has lost the magic touch when it comes to his own Zombie stories.You can probably skip this one and not feel like you missed anything.

LIMITLESS was one of those movies I really wanted to see after I saw the previews.The premise of the film was great and insightful.The first half of the movie lived up to the expectations and set the proper tone for what this sort of experience and capability would be like.But the second half of the movie seemed like it was written by a different screenplay writer and led by a different Director.The second half of the movie really faded into a sort of comedy and all the tensions and initial build-up was lost.In the end, the film failed to fully capitalize on its initial brilliance.Add to that the fact one must overlook the obvious logic flaws in the movie .....Foe example, if this drug was able to make your mind so sharp and able to learn and master new skills like Classical Music and 3-4 foreign languages in only 2 days, would it have not seemed obvious to spend 3-4 days learning Chemistry so you could synthesize the mind enhancing drug yourself and thus not be reliant on somebody else for a supply ?A good premise and entertaining movie that did not quite reach its potential

Being a long time fan of Romero's DEAD series and a player of games like RE 1-3, HOTD 1-2, Doom 1-3, Quake, FEAR, etc...I was looking forward to this game and had it reserved for release day.Ugghhh what a dissapointment.The problem was not graphics, gameplay or anything else.The problem was PLAYABILITY.The game was so glitched it was unplayable.I downloaded the patch 1.1 from Groove, but still the game was unplayable.Problems like ...ACTION/FIRE button randomly becoming inoperative and doing nothing unless you rebooted game.(ie... fists or weapons would not work even when health was high and ammo was full).In fact, all mouse functions other than movement would stop working, the game would stop reading mouse clicks -or- even the "E" key for action.No option but to exit game and start over.Stiff (very stiff) character movement that made navigating very unpleasant.In summary, it was simply too glitchy and aggravating to enjoy.I uninstalled and tossed it in the trash.I wish the game had WORKED properly and smoothly.... if so, the look and feel was right on key....... it was simply the execution that made it too annoying to try and play.Since I have a P4-2.1GZ system with 512mb RAM, Nvidia 256 graphics card, etc..etc..etc.. and handle MUCH MORE COMPLEX games and software, my PC hardware is not the problem here.I should have suspected problems when I learned the game was not ACT Light Gun compatible........... lets face it.... ALL FIRST PERSON SHOOTER games should be light gun compatible !

This film was bad in every way.Not funny.Bizarre behaviour just for the heck of it ?Offensive if you are gay.Repulsive if you are straight.Ejected after 40 minutes with the thought ........ "What was this supposed to be ?"Seems like it was just an exercise in seeing how weird they could make different scenes just to be weird.

Watching INCEPTION very carefully and keeping track of the intertwined dreams and plot devices, I must express great respect for the obvious work that went into putting this film together.It is also an interesting concept on the idea of Dream Worlds -vs- Real Worlds.For example, if you went to sleep tonight but never woke up, wouldn't that dream world you lived in become your real universe ?I confess, I have had some dream worlds that I have visited that I would not mind staying in and never waking up.Having said all that and giving much respect to the makers of this film for hard work and a genuine effort, I have to say as a movie, INCEPTION is painful to watch.Some movies really pull you in and make you care for what happens the the characters.At their best, you may even briefly for a few moments forget you are watching a movie.This never happened with INCEPTION.I always felt I was watching a movie with a whole crew and director sitting behind every scene.I cared nothing about the characters.I cared nothing for their assignment.For me, it was eye candy and no substance.I know it was a big success, but for me it was totally forgettable as a movie.

This movie was a pleasant surprise.It is a shame it did not more attention.Truth be told, based on previews I was concerned it would be some cheap, stupid, teen comedy with an excuse for sleazy sex jokes.To the contrary, it was a charming and amusing "coming of age" movie about a geeky guy who loves nostalgia who does a lot of growing up and discovering important things about life when on his first big solo adventure on the road.A much better film than I was expecting.Probably Kim Cattrall's best acting performance of her career - and she was brave enough to gain weight and skip make-up in order to try and make the characterization genuine.

The premise of this film was 5+ stars.A great idea.But it fell apart in the execution.At the risk of spoiling too much of the movie, I will only point out one odd thing that really struck me.If a group of beings has the ability to manipulate and steer the futures of humans and use "portal doors" to get around, it would seem they would be advanced enough to not have to run around to chase people.I was excited when we heard about this film and LOVED the idea of the plot ... but it just didn't come together for some reason.This is an example of a film that would be a good candidate for a remake in 10 years or so --- and hope they can do more with it then.

In many ways, this remake of the original Swedish film is almost 80% an exact scene by scene remake.However, unlike many people I found the dark lighting and backgrounds more fitting to the story in this American remake.The Swedish version was very light and cheerfully bright.I also thought the kid actors were more powerful in this remake.It is a very similar remake, but I found the Swedish original a bit too artsy , while this remake used a darker and more somber tone.Both films are a bit on the slow moving side ... but they still hold your interest.

A cute modernized "remake" (or rip-off) of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE.Weber makes the film.Of course he really wasn't such a bad guy to start with which throws the story a little out of whack... heck, he saved the family business from Chapter 11 and made it a success so the whole family is now financially secure.... cut the guy some slack!!We watched this the same day as the Pitt/Jolie movie MR AND MRS SMITH and actually enjoyed this one a bit more.

Stephen King is a legendary horror writer, but virtually every attempt to bring one of his stories to the screen fails miserably.This is another example.Avoid at all costs...... uggghh.......... boring, silly and BAD !

Unlike most TV shows that start to fade by the time they reach the Sixth Season, DEXTER is actually better this season that it has been the last few seasons.Dexter actually hit a low spot in Season 3 with guest start Jimmy Smits.Season 4 & 5 got better .......... but it seems Dexter got a fresh injection of "Creative Steroids" since Season 6 is one of the best of the entire show's history.

What was this supposed to be ?Based on the previews we thought we were going to see some large scale epic "Gone With The Wind" type drama with classy elegance .......Instead AUSTRALIA started right out of the gate with a strange blend of campy humor, cheesy action, tounge in cheek jokes, poor Clint Eastwood impersonations, etc..etc..etc..It felt like the movie did not know what it wanted to be .. humor, drama, epic, ?????After 40 minutes my wife screamed at me ..... "Please take that DVD out, I can't take anymore. This is just bad"That about sums it up.Certainly not deserving of Kidman and Jackman (both of whom we like).

This is the best watch you can buy for the money .Period !I don't know how they offer such a fine product for this price.It is certainly worth 2X the price and I would pay it.This is the only watch I wear and I am hard on watches.I never take them off. SCUBA diving, yard work, swimming, showering, mixing concrete, using chainsaws in the woods, working on my car, etc..I normally get 5+ years out of these watches before I replace them, and even then they are still running and keeping time. I simply abuse them so badly they are scratched to the point you can't read the time any longer.So I toss that one that has done me such good service, grab another off the shelf and keep going.I have always liked the classic "Rolex Submariner" dive watch look ever since I saw Sean Connery wearing one in an early James Bond movie.I have worn watches with that look ever since over the years. Many were cheap garbage; but once I found the INVICTA company I have never even considered another brand.The INVICTA 8926C (with the coin beveled edge) is great !Besides, the way I beat up watches I would be an idiot to spend $5000 on a Rolex. Not to mention the fact, that I don't think any watch is worth that kind of money unless it is made of solid gold.Trust me I would rather buy 60 Invicta Pro Diver watches, wear them for 1-2 years then give them away to people who need a work watch instead of buying a single Rolex that I have to pamper and worry about.

Sometimes Director's Cuts don't make that much of a difference ............But in this case, the Director's Cut takes EXPENDABLES to a much higher level !!Now I can like EXPENDABLES much better and never watch the theatrical version again.Improvements -------1) More character development2) better choice of backing music3) different bad guys in opening ship scene4) got rid of the choppy edited fight scenes and returned a more complete natural action to the fight scenes so that you can now actually follow what is going on.Much longer and complete fight scenes5) More interplay between characters .. more comradarieIt is almost like a totally different movieSeeing this Director's Cut, I can't understand why they ever released the original Theatrical Version like it was.By comparison the original version looks like what happens when they put a movie on TV and edit the heck out of it to avoid ratings problems.Without question .......... EXPENDABLES Director's Cut is 100% better !I was not a big fan of the original release as I found it kind of shallow and nothing more than boom and pow.But this Director's Cut really makes it a better movie

The way Stallone recently brought both ROCKY and RAMBO full circle and ended those iconic film series on a good strong note with a solid note of finality was masterful.5 stars to both ROCKY BALBOA-2007 and JOHN RAMBO-2008But EXPENDABLES ?????Hmmmm ...I know it was supposed to be a sort of not-too-serious homage to the action movies of the 80s, but for some reason it did not HIT me the same way the last ROCKY and RAMBO did.Maybe I have reached a point in life where I can only appreciate a movie if there is some sort of deeper message I can relate to based on my own experiences.Perhaps I don't get excited about fireworks (literally I don't), big explosions, gunfights, fistfights and car chases like I did when I was 16 years old.For whatever reason, when it came to EXPENDABLES I could not help but feel that the reason there was so much hype and buzz about the movie was the very special assembled cast of big names.Looking at the 5 minutes of plot and 101 minutes of POW -- BOOM --- WHAM, I can't help but feel if this exact movie had been made with any other group of actors it would have been overlooked and dismissed as just another forgettable and generic action movie.This movie does have a magic, but it is because of the assembled cast led by Stallone.With any other random cast of actors, the movie would probably not seem as special.EXPENDABLES has lots of flash and energy, but not the same soul as other Stallone movies of recent years.In all fairness, perhaps it is not intended to be really deep. Perhaps it is intended to be pure escapism action, action, action.If that is the case, the fault is not with the movie itself, but with my frame of mind or expectations I may have had following ROCKY BALBOA and JOHN RAMBO.(both movies that had action but also a deeper meaningful message one can relate to).Note -- I think the scene with Rocky talking to his son outside the restaurant in RB, is one of the most powerful scenes in all of Stallone's movies.I am a big Stallone fan.I respect the guy personally and professionally.Tons of hard work went into making this film that must be respected.We watch his films like ROCKY BALBOA-2007, JOHN RAMBO-2008, Cliffhanger, Get Carter, Lock Up and others at least once per year each at our house.But in the case of EXPENDABLES, while we have added it to our Blu-Ray collection, I don't think it will be viewed quite as often in the future as our other favorite Sly films.It may just be my tastes changing as I get older that has effected my feel for this particular film.If I shift my mind into a pure action film mentality (the same mentality I may have had 25 years ago watching Arnold's COMMANDO), I may end up rating this movie higher... but mentally I'm not that same young guy anymore either.Yeah ..... I think that is a fair analysis.Lastly,I will confess, I think I may have enjoyed the two Blu-Ray bonus feature documentaries INFERNO (the filming) and FROM THE ASHES (post production) as much or more than the movie itself.It is interesting for somebody not actively involved in the film making business to see an extensive behind the scenes look at all the work that goes into making a 90 minute film.Yes, we all know you need a script, screenplay, set design, wardrobe, shoot scenes, music soundtracks, editing, etc...We all know the basic concept of how movies are made..... but as an analogy, there is a difference between knowing how a car works in theory and being able to build one yourself from scratch.The two bonus feature documentaries on the Expendables Blu-Ray go into good detail on the whole process from beginning to end.As good as the movie itself for me personally.

It takes alot of creative energy and work to write songs, record albums and make movies..... so one sometimes feels bad when they are compelled to warn others away from something that is REALLY bad.But seriously... read the other reviews on here and be warned.Their criticisms are valid for this film.I suppose since the classic "6th Sense", everybody is trying hard to make films along the same idea (ie.. the ultimate ironic twist), but whereas "6th Sense" was unique for NOT being deceptive and actually telling you the punchline all thru the movie and STILL surprising you.......... films like PREMONITION (and many others these past few years) try to deceive the audience with false information that is simply thrown in to fool the viewer (and offers no meaning or content the the film).PREMONITION is based on a good concept but only has enough substance to fill a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode.As a result it really gets longwinded, repetitive and downright boring by the time 2 hours and 12 minutes (and the ending) come along.The ending is no surprise, however the behaviour and stupidity of the characters at the end is so bad you are either annoyed -or- don't care what happens to them.Summary:A good premise for a 30 minute Twilight Zone TV episode stretched too thin for a 2+ hour long movie... stretched so thin in fact it breaks apart into pieces the viewer probably cares little about.

At face value, this is a pretty compelling documentary for a person who does not follow news events closely.On the other hand, if you are up to speed on daily news and economics in your everyday life, there is nothing new here you don't already know.The only reason I give it three (3) stars is the film seems to be biased towards placing all the blame on Wall Street executives and gives many politicians and Washington a sort of pass on all the blame.The overall mantra of the film seems to be "Private Sector is Evil, and Only The Government Can Take Care Of You".A perfect example of this complaint ......In discussing the home mortgage crisis and how home prices got inflated when too much "easy money" was made available by way of red-line loans and Washington's grand idea of trying to make home ownership possible for everybody regardless of income or credit histories ---------- They interview BARNEY FRANKS of all people !They interview him as though he is a wise prophet on the matter when in fact we all know his contributions to the mess as part of Fannie and Freddie.So while the film does a good "Timeline" of how the financial sector has gone haywire, it seems to only blame the people working on Wall Street and places little accountability or responsibility on the heads of the folks and agencies in DC that are supposed to legally monitor this stuff.Remember .... Deregulation does NOT mean the government has no ability to monitor an industry to prevent fraud or corruption ---------- It simply means they don't have their hands in the daily operations of it (ie .. Medicare & Medicaid for example, not that this runs without waste, slop or corruption either).So a good overview of the craziness that has taken finances down the wrong train track -- but weak in properly identifying those that have been the biggest culprits or shirked their duty of protecting US citizens

Simply summarized....... this is a well deserved documentary that finally gives attention and praise to the largely unknown artists of the 20s-40's who gave us the exciting artwork on the cover of all those thousands and thousands of Pulp covers during an interesting time in American History.Although usually disregarded as "quickly generated art for hire" during it's day and by the "artsy fartsy gallery art world".......... the fact is these artists produced more intense and enjoyable paintings than 90% of the stuff you see in art galleries today.
