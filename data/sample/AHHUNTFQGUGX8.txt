In his book, 'Napoleon,' Felix Markham traces the rise and fall of one of the most important men in western history. As a biography, Markham sometimes relies too much questionable references, but as a history, 'Napoleon' ranks among the great works on the subject. The reports of the battles and the men who served the Emperor are first rate. One can almost imagine being at Marengo, Austerlitz or Waterloo, or riding alside Ney, Marmont, or Junot. Perhaps some of the most appealing aspects of this book are the accounts of Napoleon's life after his exile to St. Helena and the events surrounding his death. Markham also shows us how the Napoleonic legend helped to shape post-Imperial France. I would recomend this book to anyone who would like to know more about this facinating historical figure.

The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected, but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy.

Alastair Reynolds' novel "Pushing Ice" is a stirring science fiction story that ignites the imagination and inspires the heart. The crew of the Rockhopper, a comet-mining vessel in the not-too-distant-future receives an unusual mission order- to tail and gain intelligence upon Janus, a moon of Saturn that left its orbit and began to move out of the solar system under its own power. When circumstances and human design conspire to rob the Rockhopper of the ability to return to Earth, a great adventure into the furthest reaches of the universe begins. Reynolds background in astrophysics is readily on display in this novel, as hard science pervades its pages. The characters are all generally believable and relateable , if at times a little two-dimensional. Despite its outer space setting and futuristic technology, the root of this story is a familiar one- a friendship gone sour. As in all great fiction a familiar, human story sets the stage for the epic events that follow. This is a fun science-fiction novel that fans of the genre will heartily enjoy.

Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, "Anno Dracula" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks. If you liked Dracula and don't mind the occasional "What If" scenario then you might want grab a copy of this hard to find gem.

The basic premise behind Ray Bradbury's novel 'Fahrenheit 451' is compelling. In the future, fireman don't put out fires, they start them. It is their job to seek out books and put them to the flame, making sure that no one indulges in the 'crime' of reading one. But what makes this nightmare so interesting, and relevant, is that it was not forced upon the people by their government, but was decided upon by the people themselves. Minority groups, religions, and ethnicities, who were offended by the words of writers, simply made reading unpopular and convinced the world that books were, first, a waste of time, and then the root of all evil. A wonderful 'Negative Utopia' novel in the tradition of '1984' and 'Brave New World' Bradbury's novel differs in his writing style. His prose is difficult to follow and at times leaves the reader unimpressed. If you can you're not easily turned off by Bradbury's odd and difficult way of writing perhaps you'll enjoy the deeper message of this work.

There is one word that best describes the Hornblower novels: Adventure! And 'Lieutenant Hornblower' is no exception. Indeed this is the novel where Hornblower's career in the Royal Navy really begins. From dealing with a half mad Captain to fighting off a Spanish attack on the decks of his ship this is one of the best of the Hornblower novels.

Brendan Dubois's novel 'Resurrection Day' is a fun and thrilling Alternate History story set in a world where cooler heads did not prevail. Instead of working out a deal, the US and the USSR begin a full scale nuclear war in the wake of the Cuban Missle Crisis. Ten years later The United States is a police state, where military conscription and British foreign aid are supposedly the only things keeping the country from reverting to barbarism. When a reporter stumbles onto a story about the true beginnings of the US-Soviet war he soon finds himself in the middle of the largest cover-up in US history and is soon being hunted by the US Air Force, British secret agents, and other, more mysterious figures. While the author does a tremedous job of creating this fictional, nightmare world it still doesn't hold a candle to Robert Harris's 'Fatherland,' to which this novel is often compared. It is much slower moving than 'Fatherland' and a bit more implausble in some areas. Also the characters, while compelling, aren't nearly as interesting as Harris's. That being said it should also be pointed out that this is a first rate AH story that should be embraced by all lovers of the genre. A lot of fun!

'Mother Night' is the story of Howard W. Campbell Jr. Nazi propagandist, racist, war criminal, and American spy. The story, told by Campbell from his prison cell in Israel, is of his success as a playwrite in Germany before the war, his recruitment by US intelligence, the devistation of the loss of his wife, the utter lonliness and apathy that plagued his life after the war, and the web of political intrigue that surrounds him before his trial. The style is similar to Vonnegut's other masterwork, 'Slaughterhosue Five,' in which Campbell also makes an appearence, and is told with the same wit and wonderful insight into the human soul. Truly a classic and a pleasure to read!

'Worldwar: In the Balance' assumes an alien invasion during the Second World War. Americans and Japanese, Jews and Nazis, and Russians and Germans must put thier differences aside to combat this new, greater foe who has come to enslave humanity. In Russia, Germans and partisans must band together to strike a blow against the alien Lizards, in the Warsaw ghetto the Jews must make a devils pact to free themselves from the death-filled policies of the Nazis, and in North America scientists scramble to create the ultimate weapon that will allow humanity to fight the Lizards on something approaching even terms. Turtledove's 'Worldwar' series, which begins here, is one of his greatest creations. Dealing with warfare on a grand scale, and the great science-fiction tradition of alien invasion, the 'Worldwar' series is a fun and entertaining marraige of thought-provoking alternate history and classic science-fiction. There are a few too many characters and the plot does tend to slow down at times but these are minor points when compared with the overall strength of the story. This book brilliantly sets the stage for the three novels that follow and the sequal series, 'Colonization.'

Glenn Meade's novel 'The Sands of Sakkara' is a well thought out page turner that fans of World War Two spy fiction will love. The story revolves around two friends, Harry Weaver and Jack Halder, who find themselves on opposite sides of a plot to kill the President of the United States. Set during the Cairo conference of 1943, Halder is sent to scope out the security surrounding Roosevelt so that Otto Skorzeny's crack SS commandos can move in. But British intelligence soon learns of the plan and tries to stop him with the help of American Lt. Col. Harry Weaver. In the center of the action, and these two men's lives, is Rachel Stern, the woman they both love. Though the plot does bog down at times, it nevertheless captures the spirit of some of the best World War Two spy thrillers. A lot of fun.

If I could give more than five stars to 'the Count of Monte Cristo' I certainly would. Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness. The story's protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he lingers for years. During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune. Dantes uses this fortune to set a plan into action. For years he has dreamed of revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it. More riviting than the web of intrigue Dantes spins to fulfill his scheme is the deeper quest for self-redemption that unknowingly haunts him. Retribution and revenge, though important plot points, take a backseat to Dumas' opptimism in this stirring tale. Magnificent!

Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune,' ranks among the great works of fiction and is perhaps the greatest of it's genre. The novel is a subtle but effective weaving together of political intrigue, heart-racing action, intense story, and incredably well-drawn characters. Paul Atredies, the young son of the Duke Leto, and his family are removed from their home world of Calidan to oversee operations on the desert world of Arrakis, or as it is better known, Dune. The story that follows sees Paul grow not only into a man, but into a super-human being capable of destroying the hated enemies of the Atredies, the evil Harkonnen. Herbert's understanding of human nature serves him well in this novel and his concerns about our own ecology are apparent. Like Asimov's 'Foundation,' series and the 'Childe Cycle' of Gorden R. Dickson, Herbert's 'Dune' is a classic of Science Fiction that will ignite any reader's imagination.

John Lewis Gaddis' book "The Cold War, A New History" accomplishes what it sets out to do very nicely- provide a general overview of the events, personalities, and issues at stake in the US-USSR confrontation. Gaddis expertly traces the evolution of relations between the two powers, their allies, and neutral nations during the period in which nuclear annihilation was an ever present fact of life.One of the final chapters, which Lewis dubbed 'Actors' deals with those personalities who, whether intentionally or not, contributed to the Soviet Union's demise. These figures obviously include Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, but Gaddis provides wonderful insights into the roles of Pope John Paul II, Lech Wa''sa, Deng Xiaoping, and others whose actions helped to topple the "Dark and Evil Empire" of the USSR.The virtue of this work, its brevity, is also its greatest weakness. Certain events are glossed over rather quickly leaving the reader not fully appreciating their effects upon the larger stage of the Cold War. Watergate, the Suez Crisis, the Bay of Pigs, and even the Cuban Missile Crisis to name a few, simply don't get the time and consideration that they require for a truly thorough history. Gaddis uses just under 270 pages of text to tell an international history of over 45 years.That said, if you are new to studying this era you will find a good overview here. Also, serious students will still be amazed at Gaddis' analysis of key points in the conflict, and his take on the Cold War as whole. I enjoyed and learned a lot from this book, I only wish it had been longer.

'Red Storm Rising' is a remarkable look at a Soviet attack on NATO. Clancy, a master of making the complex understandable, gives a meticulously researched senario in which after an internal crisis, the Soviet leadership decide that thier only recourse is war. As with most Clancy novels, the characters are many and sometimes seem a little one-dimensional, but that hardly detracts from his fast paced story and action filled plot. A must for Clancy fans and a great read for lovers of military fiction.

I'm a little more than halfway through Bernard Cornwell's 'Sharpe' series and so far 'Sharpe's Company' is my favorite. This novel has Richard Sharpe fighting for his command and his family while waging war against the French held fortress of Badajoz. And as though this task wasn't daunting enough, Sharpe's nemisis Obidiah Hakeswill returns to settle an old score. Consistently entertaining, Cornwall's attention to detail is nothing less than awe-inspiring. I would highly recommend 'Sharpe's Comapany' to anyone interested in military fiction or to lovers of great action and suspence novels.

'Flying Colours' is undoubtedly one of the best books in the Hornblower saga. The novel begins with Hornblower a prisoner of the French and soon to stand trial in Paris for piracy. As he and his trusty first mate liuetenant Bush are transported through France they sieze a chance to escape and a thrilling adventure follows. This is the seventh book in the Hornblower saga, picking up right where 'Ship of the Line' left off and setting the stage for 'Lord Hornblower,' arguably the best in the series. Wonderful!

Right and Wrong. Joy and Despair. Good and Evil. These are the themes Robert Louis Stevenson addresses in his work, 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.' The story is told from the point of view of John Utterson, a lawyer and friend to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll. After relating a disturbing tale of an angry fiend assaulting a small girl, Utterson begins to question the odd behavior of his friend. As he investigates further into the life of Dr. Jekyll he unconvers a story so horrific, so terrifying, that he can hardly believe it. Truly a great work of English Literature, 'Jekyll and Hyde' is a magnificent story that takes the reader to the very edge of maddness.

F. Paul Wilson's horror novel, "The Keep" is a fun and eerie tale set in the midst of the Second World War. When German soldiers begin disappearing at an old castle in Romania on the eve of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, reinforcements are sent to investigate. What they find is much more horrific than any of them could imagine. And a predominant local Jew will have his faith and his loyalty to his daughter tested as he finds an unlikely ally against the Nazis, a creature that quite possibly is even more evil. This book definitely throws the reader some red herrings and keeps him on his toes, and offers a great surprise ending. Wilson succeeds in creating a deep feeling of chaos just beneath the surface of otherwise stable characters and common situations. This ability sets Wilson as a captivating and supremely entertaining writer. There are a few moments that drag, but not many. Fans of horror will surly enjoy this macabre tale of supernatural terror.

Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' is a wonderfully horrifying look at one man's obsession and the evil that comes from it. Victor von Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist, discovers the secret of bestowing life on lifeless matter. After creating a hideously deformed being Frankenstein quits the experiment and leaves his 'monster' to his own devices. Months later Frankenstein pays the price as the 'monster' seeks it's revenge. Far from the Boris Karloff idea of Frankenstein's monster, Shelly's creature is one that invokes sympathy and pity as he is cast out from the human world and forced to endure existence without companionship. The basic theme of the work is also an important moral- that obsession, if unchecked, can only result in despair. Truly a great work and one that fans of horror have embraced for over one hundred years.

Heinz Hohne's study of Nazi Germany's SS, "The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS" chronicles the dreaded organization brilliantly. Hohne's work, now over forty years old, remains one of the great works on the subject and an important tool in the study of Hitler's Third Reich.The book covers all of the major events, characters, and themes of the time including the all of the SS's subdivisions like the Gestapo, the SD, the Totenkampf, and the Waffen-SS. Hohne offers detailed and fascinating looks at Heinrich Himmler, Reinhard Heydrich, Adolf Eichmann, and others. The formation of the SS as Hitler's personal security detail is covered exhaustively, as is its role in the Rohm purge of 1934. Hohne skillfully writes of the organization's expansion once the National Socialists came to power, and how its leaders exploited Hitler's divide and rule power structure to attain its aims.Hohne's consideration of the role of the SS in formulating and implementing Nazi racial policy is by turns enlightening and terrifying. Created as an organization for Germany's racial elite, it was charged with marginalizing and ultimately murdering those who didn't fit into the Reich's perceptions of acceptability.The SS certainly wasn't the only criminal organization within the Third Reich, nor was it solely responsible for Germany's police state, concentration camp system, or program of mass murder. But it had a major, if not leading role in all of them. This book, while occasionally offering a dated perspective on one or two minor points, is still the definitive study of Hitler's Praetorian Guard.

In 'Rainbow Six' master spy John Clark is the head of an international anti-terrorist task force with his sidekick and son-in-law Chavez at his side. 'Rainbow' starts with a bang and doesn't let go. From thwarting an attempted hijacking to stopping the kidnapping of a Swiss banker to Battling baddies at a Spanish amusement park, 'Rainbow' is unique in Clancy's novels as it is almost non-stop action. This is both a plus and a minus. While the pace is fast and the story riveting, some of the humor and political intrigue that marked his previous novels are missing. Also, President Jack Ryan wasn't even given a walk-on appearence. Even mention of him was restricted to only 'The President.' Reguardless, 'Rainbow Six' is must reading for all Tom Clancy fans.

Clancy's new novel, 'The Bear and the Dragon' is proof once more of the author's amazing story-telling abilities. This time out President Jack Ryan, (newly-elected,) has his hands full with Russia, China, and his own staff. In Russia Ryan's friend and head of the Russian Security Service, Golovko, is targeted by unknown assassins. The good news for the Ivans is that huge gold and oil deposits are located in their backyard- Siberia. This unexpected wealth draws the interest, (and jealousy,) of their neighbors the Chinese. When ecomonic factors in the US and around the world threaten China's prosperity the Politburo makes a horrifying desicion: War with Russia and her new ally, the USA. Though this book ranks with the many other great Clancy novels it is, perhaps, a little too long. At well over a thousand pages the story does seem a little stretched sometimes. Also, Ryan seems to do more whinning in this book than ever before- Something you'd never expect from the hero of 'Red October' and 'Sum of All Fears.' These points aside 'The Bear and the Dragon' is a thrilling ride with a trademark Clancy climax that will leave you breathless!

'Slaughterhouse-Five' is Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece of war and it's consequences to the average joe. Vonnegut's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, has come unstuck in time. One moment he's in World War Two, the next he's a middle aged optomitrist, the next he's a small boy, the next he's on the far away world of Tralfamadore, the next he's delivering a speech that will end in his death. Through this bumping back and forth through time Billy learns that life is a collection of moments and that linear thinking is unique to the human race. Funny, sad and thought provoking, 'Slaughterhouse-Five' is an intelligent look at one man's journey through life after living through the horrors of war. Brilliant!

'Sharpe's Battle,' starts out with a bang and then gets bogged down to an ultimatley unsatisfying ending. While this book holds true to the spirit of the series and the attention to historical detail is first rate (a Cornwell trademark,) the wonderful story is sacrificed in Cornwell's attempt to illustrate the battle of Fuentes De Ornero. In other 'Sharpe' novels the battle scenes enhance the story but not so in 'Sharpe's Battle.' Fans of the series should enjoy it but those new to the world of Richard Sharpe would do well read the author's original series which starts with 'Sharpe's Rifles.'

The investigation that follows takes Renko in directions that put him at odds with the KGB, the FBI, and the NYPD. In addition to being a first rate thriller, 'Gorky Park' shows the reader the fear and paranoia that pervaded the air in Soviet Russia. A bit slow at times, 'Park' nevertheless will keep you wondering just who can be trusted.

As a huge fan of Heinlein's work, I was more than a little dissapointed with 'I Will Fear No Evil.' While many trademark Heinlein-type characters and moments can be found, it was definatley one of his slower moving novels with not much payoff at the end. The premise, though, is intriguing. A wealthy man dies and is still-living brain is placed in a females' body. If you are a fan of Heinlein and know what to expect from him, you might very well enjoy this novel. But if you are new to Heinlein, may I recomend 'Starship Troopers' or 'Revolt in 2100.'

In 'Ship of the Line' daring British sea capatin Horatio Hornblower fights not only the French under the tyrant Napoleon, but his own heart as well. After falling in love with Lady Pamela Wellesley his hopes are shattered when she marries an admiral whose ego considerably outweighs his talents. What is worse Hornblower's conscience is racked with guilt over his disloyalty to his own wife, Maria. But before this becomes too much of a soap opera Forester plunges Hornblower into the dangerous swashbuckling sea where he uses every trick in the book to ensnare his French opponents. The ending is perhaps the greatest cliff hanger in all the series which leads into the next novel, 'Flying Colours.' Only a writer of Forester's genius can create so well both the moving human story and great adventure that is 'Ship of the Line.'

Richard Matheson's horror novella, "I Am Legend" is a finely crafted novel which mixes vampire horror, survivalist end-of-the-world themes, and questions of morality in a world turned upside down. Will Smith's pretentious, overblown film version completely missed the point of this beautifully written and generally frightening novella. Both Vincent Price's "The Last Man on Earth" and Charleton Heston's "The Omega Man" were far closer to this book in both story and tone. The protagonist, Robert Neville, is the only survivor of a plague that either kills its victims, or turns them into a flesh-eaten vampires. When Neville begins to kill the vampires in his quest to stay alive and find a cure, he fails to understand the depth of their remaining humanity, and therefore he becomes the monster, he becomes the legend of their nightmares. This is the point that the Will Smith version completely missed. Read the book and then see Price's and Heston's films. You decide which is best.

It never ceases to amaze me how a story so full of historical detail can be so consistently entertaining. 'Sharpe's Tiger' has the series' protaganist, Richard Sharpe, serving as a lowly private in India in 1799 and infiltrating the stronghold of the Tipoo Sultan before the arrival of the British army. Many factors contribute to Cornwell's remarkable novel, but the one that stands out is the character of Obidah Hakeswill, an antagonist so loathsome he is sure to go down as one of the great literary villans of all time.

John Keegan's penetrating look at four military commanders, "The Mask of Command" is a wonderful examination of war, strategy, and generalship. One of our finest military historians, Keegan brilliantly examines the role leadership has historically played in ancient and modern warfare. His case studies include Alexander the Great, whose daring, even reckless disregard for danger earned him the respect and devotion of his Macedonian force and its Greek 'allies'. Keegan's careful breakdown of Alexander's force, the strategies it employed, and Alexander's overall flamboyance on the battlefield contribute to a greater understanding of the period and military realities of the day. The second study, the Duke of Wellington, offers a more detached, though still fully engaged mind. Keegan describes Wellington as the anti-hero, in contrast to Alexander's heroics. A British aristocrat well aware of his station, Wellington employed all of his resources and cunning to win, but did so without Alexander's dramatics. Third, Keegan explores U.S. Grant during the US Civil War. Grant is the democratic soldier, committed to the republican ideal. He is engaged in prosecuting the war and always keenly aware that war itself lifted him out of obscurity and placed him in the critical leadership role. Finally, Keegan explores the twisted, though occasionally militarily brilliant mind of Adolf Hitler. Hitler commanded far behind the lines and continually inserted himself further and further down the chain of command. His justification for his own military judgment was his experience in the trenches of World War I. Hitler's growing disconnect with military reality as the war progressed spelled ultimate doom for Germany.Concise and well written, "The Mask of Command" offers fascinating insights into military leadership over the ages. Keegan is always worth reading and this work is one of his best.

Alistair Horne's book "A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954-1962" is an exhaustively detailed account of the Algerian war for independence against France in the mid-twentieth century. Horne brings his extraordinary skills as a writer and an historian to provide a readable and in-depth account of the parties involved, the people who shaped the conflict, and the climate of terror that pervaded Algeria and France at the time.Horne brilliantly examines the FLN, the Algerian nationalist movement as it sought to confront the French government's policy of recognizing their homeland as just another collection of administrative departments within France. This is contrasted with the view of the pieds noirs, the French colonials whose lives were heavily invested in maintaining the status quo of French control, even to the point of rigging elections and using violence against the Muslim population. As the conflict grows Horne offers a wonderful account of the last days of the Fourth Republic, the arrival on the scene of De Gaulle, and the increasingly unstable political scene in Paris that threatened civil war on more than one occasion. The Battle of Algiers is shown as the desperate terrorist plot that it was, which only incited further violence from the French after the slaughter of civilians by the FLN. Horne makes sense of the senseless shifting of political allegiance as the government in Paris is perceived as too hard line for some, too soft for others. The revolt of the generals and the advent of the OAS, the secret army organization determined to keep Algeria French is chronicled with the skill and drama of a novelist.At times the book's detail is a little overwhelming, and serves to bog down the narrative. Additionally, its easy to see that Horne, a British chronicler of French history, is far from a disinterested observer. Though he often deplores the methods of the FLN, it is with the Algerian nationalists that Horne's sympathies lie. The French are certainly not always treated as black-caped villains, but nor are the legitimate concerns of the pieds noirs given ample consideration. Also, one would have liked to see Horne take the narrative further. Rather than a brief, episodic conclusion of the years that followed, a deeper history of the problems of the now-independent Algeria would have added considerably to this work.This is a very good work of history and proves once again Horne's abilities as a modern historian. Anyone interested in French or North African history, or the problems of decolonization in general should check this book out.

Bram Stoker's tale of terror, 'Dracula,' is just as chilling today as it must have been to readers a hundred years ago. Stoker's original story, which has been told many times since in film and book, is the tale of Johnathen Harker, his love, and his friends, and their horrific experiences at the hands of Count Dracula. The book begins with Harker traveling to Transylvania to meet with the mysterious Dracula. Aquainting him with English customs and traditions when the Count buys land all over London from his firm, Harker soons learns of Dracula's true nature- that of an unnatural fiend who causes destruction wherever he goes. When Dracula travels to England Harker's friends enlist the aide of Dr. Van Helsing, the only man who understands just what evil the Count is capable of. The story that follows is one of love, hate, maddness, and adventure as Dracula seeks to destroy Harker and his friends. As well as being a great work of literature, 'Dracula' is a wonderful tale of horror that modern readers are sure to enjoy!

'The Vampire Lestat' is a wonderful work of fiction that takes the reader through centuries of undead history. The story revolves around the adventures of the newly-created Vampire Lestat and his quest to understand his demonic origins. His quest takes him around the world and back through time as other, older Vampires share with him their secrets. In 'Lestat' we see a much different being than was presented to us in 'Interview with a Vampire.' Rather than the cocky, vain, unfeeling Vampire that we had known Lestat tells his story with humility and an almost human fraility. Rice's sensual writing style and her unwavering ability to probe the darker sides of the human condition make her an entertaining and thought-provoking author. The Vampire Chronicles are truly great works of fiction and 'The Vampire Lestat' may be the best of the series.

I read 'the General' shortly after I finished Forester's 'Hornblower' novels and was pleased to find that the same depth and adventure that Forester brought to the British Navy of the 19th century he also brought to the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe. 'The General' lets us into the mind of a British General in the opening months of the war. Forester's protaganist reflects the mindset of those who conducted the war and allowed it to become the bloody mess that history remembers. An Amazing novel.

Richard Overy's "The Dictators, Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia" is a wonderful look at two of the most repressive regimes in history and the men who led them. Overy compares how both men maneuvered their way into power in their respective nations. The 'Utopia' both men sought is considered heavily throughout this work- the 'Racial State' for Hitler and the 'Classless State' for Stalin.Overy's comparison of the men of course addresses the events that led to their epic showdown in World War II, and this makes for some of the work's most fascinating chapters. For instance, Overy presents the growing arms race between Germany and the USSR in the 1930s as the natural precursor to the Cold War arms race between the USSR and the United States. The relationships between both dictators and their military leaderships is also very illuminating as both men considered themselves quite adept at military affairs after their service in WWI and the Russian Civil War, respectively.This comparative study of the two regimes is must reading for students of modern European History and stands along side Robert Gellately's "Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe" as one of the great works on the subject.

Though 'Beat to Quarters' falls in the middle of the Hornblower series it was the first written, as well as one of the best. The story takes place when Hornblower is ordered to assist colonial Spanish rebels. After defeating a Spanish warship and handing the vessel over to the rebels Hornblower recieves shocking news: Napoleon has invaded Spain. Now that Spain has become Britian's ally Hornblower must reagain control of the Spanish warship from the rebels and give it back to the rightful owners. The action that follows is the naval adventure that author C. S. Forester is known for. Also, Forester throws his gallant protagonist a curve ball by introducing him to Lady Pamela Wellesely, sister of the Duke of Wellington. The attraction is sudden and unexpected but more than a little complicated. One of the best novels in the series, 'Beat to Quarters' is consistantly exciting and absolutly entertaining. Fans of the series and those new to it will applaud Forester's first Hornblower novel.

John Steakley's "Vampires" is a fun horror/action tale which follows the adventures of a team of Vatican financed vampire killers. The tale does a wonderful job of creating a dark world where the forces of good and evil are in state of constant war. While the book is generally entertaining it pales in comparison to John Carpenter's 1998 film adaptation. The film takes the book, which is good but lethargic at times, and gives it a more kinetic spin. It was a liberal adaptation to be sure, and Carpenter changed much, but it generally worked. I wouldn't recommend this book to those who have already seen the film, but for those looking for a fun novel equal parts action and horror, you may enjoy Steakley's work.

Alastair Horne's book "To Lose a Battle: France 1940" is a wonderful work of military history that details the German boldness and Allied incompetence that led to the Third Reich's greatest military victory of the war. Horne portrays the Allied generals as bickering and indecisive, jealous of command authority yet unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. By contrast the Germans, outmanned and outgunned, and using clever military propaganda, overwhelmed the French, British, and Belgium forces by a shock and awe campaign that was more bluster than blitzkrieg. Horne's condemnation is well taken- if only the Allies had planned better, been more open to improvisation, had a more clearly detailed command structure, and had they not given in to the overstated myth of German military might, they could have repulsed the Wehrmacht handily. This is a great book that reads like a novel. I highly recommend it.

In the 1960's German Journalist Peter Miller stumbles upon the diary of a German Jew who had been shipped to a concentration camp in Riga, Latvia during World War Two. Reading the diary Miller is enraged at the abuses of the sadistic camp commandant and vows to find him and bring him to justice. What Miller finds instead is the organisation known as Odessa, a super-secret society made up of former members of the SS to protect their own. As Miller gets closer and closer to the truth, his life is put in jeoperady. Finally, with the aide of Jewish Nazi-hunters, he begins a plan that will end either with the Riga commandant at the end of a rope, or his own grisly death. Thrilling from the first page, 'The Odessa File' contains the same heart-pounding suspense that filled Forsyth's earlier work, 'The Day of the Jackel,' and has one of the greatest twist endings in modern fiction. For anyone who enjoys thrilling fiction mixed with historical fact, 'The Odessa File' will not disappoint.

David McCullough's biography of our 33rd president is a riveting portrait of a common man thrust into the most powerful position in the world, and triumphing brilliantly. As always, McCullough brings his considerable skills as an historian and storyteller to his subject, making "Truman" a wonderful read from beginning to end.Truman's humble origins as a Missouri farmer are brought to life, as is his honorable service as an artillery captain in World War I. McCullough accurately presents Truman's involvement with the corrupt Pendergast machine and his continued loyalty to Tom Pendergast ever after the boss' conviction for corruption. Truman's career in the senate and his unexpected selection by FDR to be his running mate in 1944 play out like supreme political drama, especially McCullough's presentation of the Democratic conventions of the era.But its Truman's assumption of the presidency upon FDR's death that makes the reader hold his breath. Truman's still-controversial decision to drop the atomic bomb, his overseeing of the Marshall Plan, and his perseverance through the Berlin blockade and the beginning of the Cold War, all in his first term, makes for fascinating reading. Truman's bid for reelection in 1948 is equally fascinating as no one at the time thought he had a chance against the Republican nominee, Thomas Dewey. McCullough examines Truman's actions during his second term including the Korean War, the Soviet attainment of atomic weapons, the 'loss' of China, and his dealings with problematical cabinet members. The final chapters dealing with Truman's later years are poignant and equally fascinating.I had the privilege to hear Mr. McCullough speak at my graduation this last May shortly after finishing "Truman". The author's wisdom to learn the lessons of history is something that I, graduating with a Masters degree in history, could really appreciate. This book is a great place to begin learning those important lessons.

I was a little skepitcal when I read the first book in this series, 'American Front.' I felt it conatined far too many characters and situations that the overall story would get lost in the shuffle. This fear followed me into the next book, 'Walk in Hell.' Although 'Walk' was a lot better I was worried that Turtledove was missing out on some great ideas with regaurds to the way the European war progressed and also the political aspects of the war in the two Americas. But I am happy to say that the new book in the series, 'Breakthroughs,' addresses these aspects of the war in a wonderful and satisfying way. As the war continues, new tactics are employed that allow the U.S. to force her enemies to seek peace- but that's just the beginning of the troubles that lie ahead, troubles that both Yankees and Rebs simply aren't prepared for. In the north the U.S. must learn to integrate it's hard-won conquests into the union, in the south confederates stuggle to adjust to humiliation and defeat and turtledove even gives a character with disturbing parrellels to Adolf Hitler during his time in the trenches. Far and away the best of the series so far (excluding 'How Few Remain') this is a fun romp through what might have been. Turtldove is once again on top of his game!

David L. Robbins novel, 'The War of the Rats,' is a horror-filled look at the demise of the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, and the legendary sniper duel that took place amid so much destruction. The narrative presents the Russian super-sniper, Zatsiev, as the protagonist and the German, Thorvald, as the less-than-dynamic villian who challenge each other through the crosshairs as two mighty armies clash along the Volga river. The Russian Zatsiev is made a hero in communist newspapers throughout the Soviet Union when he proves the greatest sniper in the Red army. To bring down Soviet moral the German command decides to send Thorvald, the leader of Germany's elite sniper school at Gnossen, to beat Zatsiev at his own game. What happens next is an exciting battle of skill between the two warriors. While at times the story slows down, Robbins' treatment of the hardships of the largest battle of World War Two are brought amazingly to life. The reader can't help but pity the common soldiers of both armies as they are needlessly sacrificed by their respective governments. A first rate thriller, 'The War of the Rats,' is must reading for fans of great military fiction, (the story is a novelization of actual events.) Wonderful!

The second volume in Richard J. Evans Third Reich trilogy matches the first for breathtaking scope, attention to detail and truly fine writing. Evans successfully illustrates how the Nazi process of Gleichschaltung (coordination) allowed fascism to permeated every facet of German life. Propaganda, police terror, the Nazi war on the churches, the creation of the racial state, and the preparation for world war are all addressed in all their horrific wonder by the author. This is another important book in the pantheon of Third Reich histories and will no doubt educate the curious for years to come.

The Richard Sharpe novels of Bernard Cornwell rank among the great works of military fiction and are all wonderful adventure stories, but 'Sharpe's Triumph' doesn't quite have the same punch as those earlier works. Richard Sharpe, a Sergeant in the King's Army for four years, is sent on a dangerous mission to capture a former East India Company Lieutenant who is now a Major in the forces of an Indian prince. Sharpe, resolute as always, determines to find the traitor and bring him to justice in the hopes that this success will reward him with an officer's commission. But hot on his tail is Sharpe's old enemy Obidiah Hakeswill, a man so vile that he will stop at nothing to get his revenge. While it was fun to see characters like Hakeswill and Colonel McCandless again, the story boggs down at times. Missing is the humor that Sharpe's future Sergeant Harper brought to the series and the tense drama of fighting the armies of Napoleon. The view Cornwell gives us of the battle of Assaye, however, is stunning. Only Cornwell could make batttlefield action come alive in such a brilliant and unmistakable way. Fans of the series should check this one out but if you're new to the world of Richard Sharpe may I recommend starting with either 'Sharpe's Tiger,' or 'Sharpe's Rifles.'

An author's first novel is always a shot in the dark for the reader. Jeff Slate and David Rearden's new book, 'Bloodsworth Island,' is entertaining, though occasionally has it's flaws. The story centers around the efforts of one genetic researcher, Dr. Gene Nolan, to understand just what is going on at his research lab, the Davenport center on Bloodsworth Island off the coast of Maryland. During his quest he is forced to realize that the high ideals that the center was based on are only a front for a sinister group of men who will stop at nothing to see their demonic dreams become reality. The writing style is at times weak, and often choppy. The authors take too much time telling the story to really develop any of the characters save a few. That being said, where 'Bloodsworth Island' succeeds is in the feeling of paranoia that it establishes. At many times the same creepy feeling that Orwell gave us in '1984' is present and the conflict of conscience that Dr. Nolan experiences makes for fun and entertaining reading. Also interesting are the little touches the authors include. For instance the birthday of Dr. Gallagher, who runs the Davenport center, is givin as April 20th, (Hitler's birthday), 1939, (the year the Second World War began). If you're looking for a fun thriller with shades of Orwell and Huxley this might be one you should check out.

The 'Hornblower' novels by C. S. Forester are all consistently entertaining and fun, but the first novel in the series, 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower,' is a rather slow start. Rather than a single novel, it is a series of short stories revolving around Hornblower's first years at sea. While the stories maintain that sense of adventure that are Forester's trademark, it lacks a consistency which is to be found in the later volumes. 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower' is must reading for fans of the series but for those new to the 'Hornblower' novels perhaps a better introduction would be to read 'Lieutenant Hornblower,' the second novel of the series.

"Roman Blood" by Steven Saylor is a wonderful murder mystery in the waning days of the Roman Republic. Saylor's protagonist Gordianus the Finder is a talented investigator in the classic private detective mold. When a notable citizen of the Republic, Sextus Roscius is murdered, Gordianus is engaged by a young Cicero to discover the true identity of the killer. What follows is a tense game of cat and mouse as Gordianus sifts through the clues to find the truth. While the story is fun and very engaging, the real star of this novel is Saylor's command of historical detail. One feels the thin veneer of civilization delicately hovering just above absolute violent chaos. This is a fantastic first entry in Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series. Check it out.

"Hitler's Generals", edited by Correlli Barnett, contains many well-written and thoughtful essays of Hitler's military commanders in World War II. From these pages a greater portrait of the German military, and indeed the entire Third Reich emerges.The essays are divided into five parts that categorize the subjects effectively: I. The Anti-Nazi Generals; II. The Desk Generals; III. The Feldherren; IV. The Battlefront Generals; & V. The Innovators. The essays within each section offer brilliant sketches of German generalship.The work overall tells the story of brave men willing to fight and die for their country, but only too willing to fall under the spell of Hitler's personality. The reader grows angrier and angrier that more generals didn't follow the example of Ludwig Beck, who quit as Army Chief of Staff because of opposition to Hitler's reckless policies. The incident is recorded in Robert O'Neil's "Fritsch, Beck and the Fuhrer." Brian Bond's "Brauchitsch" and Barry A. Leach's "Halder" show two talented military administrators sidelined as Hitler grabbed for more power by inserting himself further and further down the chain of command. Perhaps the most compelling essay, and the most sympathetic general, is Samuel W. Mitcham Jr.'s "Kleist", as it details the Field Marshal's attempts to extirpate his army from the Caucuses in the wake of the Stalingrad disaster.Overall this work is filled with fascinating sketches of German military leadership. Important lessons are learned from studying the lives of these brilliant, flawed men.

Gitta Sereny's monumental work 'Abert Speer: His Battle with Truth,' is a book of major importance about a man and an era that the world must never forget. Albert Speer, first Hitler's architect and later his Minister for Armaments and War Production, will remain forever an enigma. Did he know about the Holocaust? To what extent was his involvment? Should he have been hanged at Nuremburg? Was his apologetic manner in later years sincere? These are the questions that Sereny asks and attempts to answer, often arriving at conclusions that make even the reader uncomfortable, forcing him or her to realize that the Nazi system, at the time, could have held as much appeal for them as it did for Speer and for all of Germany. Sereny's intervews with Speer, her numerous interviews, and her exhaustive research all contribute to this masterful book. Of particular interest are the people whose lives were affected most by the madess of Hitler. Sereny's talks with the son of Martin Bormann are both chilling and incredibly moving. I do feel as though this book, along with Speer's own works, 'Inside the Third Reich,' and 'Spandau: the Secret Diaries,' (his thrid book, 'Infiltrator,' is one to be missed,) are essential reading for any serious student of Nazi Germany.

In 'The Goebbles Diaries, 1942-43,' we are given a glimpse into the mind of Nazi Germany's genius of propaganda and one of Hitler's most trusted lieutenants. These diaries shed light on the Nazis view of Churchill, Stalin and all the other central figures of the era. Goebbels also tells us of the anger he and other leading Nazis felt over the defection of Italy to the allied camp, dealing with the devastating allied air raids, and the fear and anxiety over the revearses on the Eastern front. Unfortunatley, these pages don't give us as clear a view of Hitler as one would hope and passages dealing with the Holocaust are few and far between. In all, Goebbels presents himself as a champion of National Socialist ideals who is loved by Germany and respected by his enemies. What one really sees is the almost ridiculous opptimism that Goebbels held through these years of struggle. It is surprising just how firm was Goebbel's conviction that victory was certain. Those interested in the Third Reich should read Goebbel's diaries as it is a rare look into this troubled time written by one of it's greatest criminals.

'Fox on the Rhine,' by Douglas Niles and Micheal Dobson, is a wonderful story of just how differently World War Two could have turned out if the Army Officers plot had succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler. In 'Fox' Hitler is killed at Rastenberg on July 20th, 1944 and Germany is soon thrown into a sea of chaos. Heinrich Himmler and his SS soon move to gain the loyalty of the army and seek a seperate peace with the Soviets. Once that's accomplished, Himmler appoints Erwin Rommel, 'the Desert Fox,' to command an alternate version of the 'Battle of the Bulge.' While at times Dobson and Niles spend a little too much time showing off the fruits of their research, which is impressive, they do manage to tell a riveting story, and while some aspects of 'Fox' do stretch the reader's believabilty, the story is riveting and builds to an explosive climax. But perhaps the most fun is the simple question that the authors ask and attempt to answer: What would have happened had Erwin Rommel commanded the Ardennes Offensive? A great ride that ranks among the best works of alternate history.

In his novel 'The Fist of God,' Forsyth tells the story of the gulf war with the (fictional?) threat of Iraqi nuclear capability. The story is multi-leveled and centers around British and American attempts to sabotage the production of an Iraqi atomic bomb. The characters range from a British commando behind the lines in Kuwait, to a Mossad agent romancing a European banker, to the butcher of bagdad himself, Saddam Hussein. Along the way, the reader is treated to Forsyth's unique style that keeps the pace moving from page one. Like the novels of Tom Clancy, this one makes you wonder just how much the author knows about the inner-workings of Washington, London, and other centers of power throughout the world. How much of this novel is true? I don't know. But I do know that for anyone who loves great action and well thought out thrillers this is a novel that is sure to please.

SS-GB is undoubtedly Deighton's best work of fiction. The basic premise presupposes a Nazi victory over Great Britain sometime in early 1941, (Presumably after a failed evacuation from Dunkirk and a disasterous Battle of Britain.) The story itself takes place later that year and earily accounts a Nazi occupation of England. While the protagonist falls a little too often into the 'cop on the edge' cliche, the fast paced plot, centering around the rivaly between the S.S. and Wehrmacht, will keep the reader riveted. Must reading for all fans of 'What If' history and more than enough tension for readers of international suspence.

Alan Furst's "The World At Night" is a haunting portrait of Pairs under the Nazi heel and one man's decision to oppose it. Film producer and reluctant soldier Casson loses everything when the Germans invade and appears to be a man with nothing left to lose. When some Parisians insist that now is the time to look out only for one's self, Casson soon learns the truth- that his nation and his people are still worth fighting for. He is soon recruited into the secret war against the Nazis and uses all his tricks and connections in the film world to learn what he can and foil their designs. Like most Furst novels the city of Paris itself is presented as a major character, indeed it reads almost as Casson's slavish mistress, or unrequited love. Furst again emphasizes character over plot and provides a richly deep, thoughtful spy thriller. A little slow at times, "The World At Night" nevertheless maintains the reader's interest throughout.

The fourth novel in the Hornblower series takes it's time getting started, but once the action is engaged it doesn't let go. The story begins with Hornblower and his family travelling to London where Hornblower has been called to organize the funeral of the victor of Trafalgar, Admiral Nelson. After saving a near disaster to his career, Hornblower is ordered to search for sunken treasure off the Turkish coast. Along for the ride is a German prince and his aide who have a lot to learn about seamanship. And finally, Hornblower must make a choice about whether to accept the office of post Captain in a foreign navy or 'in spite of all temptations to belong to other nations, to remain an Englishman.' The novel really doesn't pick up until after Hornblower leaves England but it soon gains momentum and doesn't stop. C.S. Forester is truly one of the greatest writers of the 20th century and 'Hornblower and the Atropos' will attest to that.

Asimov outdid himself when he wrote 'Prelude to Foundation.' This was the first Foundation story that he wrote after the original series in the 40's. 'Prelude' is the story of young Hari Seldon as he comes to the Galactic capitol Trantor to deliver his paper on the new science, pyschohistory. But Seldon's work is coveted by those who would pervert it and use it for thier own devious ends. Seldon's flight from his enemies takes him across the face of Trantor. Along the way Seldon learns the vital clues he will need make his science of prediction work. Populated with cunning characters and fantastic worlds, this is one of Asimov's greatest works and sets the stage for the entire Foundation universe. Science-fiction at it's best!

'Spandau: The Secret Diaries' is the record of Albert Speer's twenty years in the Berlin prison and is just as compelling as Speer's earlier work, 'Inside the Third Reich.' While serving his sentance Speer tells us of the endless discussions and thoughts about Hitler, Nazi Germany, and failed military strategies that he and his fellow inmates shared. Speer also tells us of the day to day boredom that was his constant companion. His insights into Hitler are perhaps the greatest ever produced and the portraits he paints of Doenitz, Raeder, von Shirach and Rudolf Hess provide wonderful glimpses into that troubled time. Perhaps most compelling of all is Speer's moral struggle with his own conscience; can a man who was part of such evil truly ever make amends? Speer relates that his daughter was invited by a Jewish family to stay with them while she visited America. To this, Speer could only cry; hoping that at least to some extent forgiveness is possible. Much more than history, this is a powerful look at one man's search for redemption.

Much more than a simple outline of the Savior's life, 'Jesus the Christ' is a detailed, penetrating account of our Lord's life and ministry. Talmage approaches the subject with the zeal of both a scholar and a true disciple. This book is must reading for anyone interested in not only the God we believe in, but also in the historical Christ and the events in the New Testiment. Truly a moving work and one which has brought many men and women closer to a personal relationship with thier Lord and Savior.

Like the first novel in the series, 'Mr. Midshipman Hornblower,' 'Admrial Hornblower in the West Indies,' is a collection of short stories rather than a single novel. And, like 'Mr. Midshipman,' it is one of the lower points in the series. 'Admiral Hornblower,' is the only Hornblower novel to take place during peacetime and so the action, where it is, seems a little forced. Lacking is the adventure of Hornblower braving the odds to meet an impossible objective. Instead, many of the stories focus on much more trivial aspects of Her Majesty's Navy. Of course this is still a Hornblower book by the master, C. S. Forester, and he doesn't leave the reader competely high and dry. The first story, by far the best, deals with Hornblower's attempt to intercept a French vessel bound for St. Helena. Hornblower must use all his cunning to stop the would-be liberators of Napoleon Bonoparte from his island prison. Also there are a some moving moments as Hornblower takes the time to relect on his brilliant career and years of service. A must read for fans of the series but certainly not Forester's best.

'The Eagle Has Landed' is Jack Higgins' first novel and it's easily one of the best WWII novels I've ever read. Higgins' masterwork is the daring tale of a German plot to kidnap Winston Churchill from a coastal English town. The story is fast paced and the characters are well drawn. Paticularly facinating is Higgins' depiction of Heinrich Himmler. A wonderful story in the tradition of 'The Day of the Jackal.&quot;

In 'The Tale of the Body Thief' Anne Rice continues her tale of the undead that she began in 1976's 'Interview with the Vampire.' In 'Body Thief,' the anti-hero Lestat is made an offer he can't refuse: To become human again by switching bodies with a master of astral projection. Offering Lestat sage advice is the human leader of the Talamasca, David Talbot, whom Lestat has begged unsuccessfully to join him as an undead companion. Once the transformation takes place Lestat again experiences life as a human. He eats, sleeps, and makes love with a passion unknown to him for two centuries. After Rice's novel, 'The Vampire Lestat,' this is by far the most entertaining and philisophical. From Lestat revealing his true self to a sympathetic nun to Talbot explaining his meeting with God and the Devil in a Paris cafe, this is by far her most thought-provoking work, and a lot of fun!

Theodore Judson's "Fitzpatrick's War" is one of those rare treasures that I found while browsing on Amazon one day and bought on a whim. I am so glad I did. This is a wonderful story, told as autobiography and historical commentary, of a future dark age, where steam power rules and the engines of war are gearing up for a new apocalypse. Sir Robert Mayfair Bruce tells his story: his befriending of the legendary Fitzpatrick at the Yukon Confederacy's War College, his employment by the warlord as an engineer in Northern India, the battles his fought against the Chinese in the name of the confederacy, the role he played in creating Fitzpatrick's new world empire, and the love he enjoyed with the politically dangerous catholic girl who captivated his heart.Its hard to put a finger on just why this novel succeeds so brilliantly. With its emphasis on military sci-fi it reminds the reader of the best elements from Orson Scott Card's "Ender's Game". Certain characters and events also draw heavily from history, such as Fitzpatrick's number one general who bares more than a passing resemblance to Stonewall Jackson from the Civil War. Fitzpatrick himself conjures the ghost of a 25th century Alexander the Great as he always reaches further and always desires more. The war itself, a world-spanning conflict in which huge, steam-powered bombers rain death upon Chinese cities and human wave attacks rush the Yukon positions is both well constructed and thoroughly readable. Judson succeeds in creating a new, frightening world for Earth's future where the feudal North American Yukon Confederacy becomes the absolute power despite its corruptions and violence.Simply put, this is a terrific science-fiction epic that has not received the due it deserves. This may be the best novel, sci-fi or otherwise, that I've read in a long while.

There is much in Norman Mailer's "The Castle in the Forest" that is reminiscent of C. S. Lewis' "The Screwtape Letters", but I won't ruin for you the reasons why. Instead I will tell you that this story is rooted in the cosmic contest between good and evil. The battle ground is a middle class Austrian family in the late 19th century. Their petty jealousies and bickering, their harbored hatreds, their dying capacity for compassion, and even their positive virtues like love and self-sacrifice are used against them to drive one of their sons into the employ of evil. The family's name is Hitler. While this is most certainly fiction and not history or biography, the reader wonders just how close to fact Mailer is in this telling. At the end of the day Adolf Hitler was no more or less human than any of us, so how was it he became the agent of evil in the 20th century? Mailer offers an important idea of just how it happened.

In 'Icon' Frederick Forsyth takes us to the dark, frightening underworld of modern Russian politics. Though the novel is fictional and the characters cleary the author's creations, it nevertheless shows the extent of the author's exhaustive research into today's Russia. The story centers around a major Russian political power who loses a secret protcol (an updated 'Mein Kampf') and his frantic search to get it back before his policies of destruction become known. Aware of this secret protocol is an ex-CIA agent, Jason Monk, who will stop at nothing to expose this would-be-Hitler as the monster he is. Along the way he tangles with the Russian Politician's securtiy chief- a former KGB officer who bested Monk during the cold war. This is another exciting novel from a master of suspence. It not only effectivly weaves cold war intrigue and modern day fears about a rearmed Russia, but Forsyth's inclusion of the true story of Aldrich Aimes, the notorious CIA traitor, make this a particularly wild ride. While 'Icon' isn't of quite the same caliber of Forsyth's earlier work, it is a riviting novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

'Wellington: A Personal History,' is a wonderful look at the hero of Waterloo. While at times the narrative tends to quickly move over some points in the Duke's life that could do with a bit more analyzation, (the Duke's Indian and Spanish campaigns,) and perhaps relies a little too heavily on reporting court gossip of the time, 'Wellington' nevertheless is a wonderful introduction to the Duke's life written in an entertaining and easy to read style. Where Hibbert's work really succeeds is in it's portrait of the Duke in his years after Waterloo. The look into the Duke as Prime Minister and confedential advisor to George IV, William IV, and Queen Victoria never fail to hold interest and passages reguarding Wellington with his family and children in general are extremly illuminating. The Duke of Wellngton was indeed one of Britain's greatest figures and Hibbert's biography will testify with a great voice to the truth of that.

Edmund Morris' "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" is simply a wonderful look at one of America's iconic historical figures. Morris' detailed approach to Roosevelt leaves one with the sense of having known him and having immensely enjoyed his company. Morris captures the mind of the man as well as any biography truly can as we see Roosevelt grow from a child caught in the middle of a family Civil War within the American Civil War, through his rise as a New York Politician and Dakota rancher, through his work as a Federal Civil Service Commissioner and New York City Police Commissioner, through his days serving as Assistant Secretary of the Navy and as the leader of the famous Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War, and finally to the exalted position of Vice President of the United States- all before he was forty-two. Throughout we see Roosevelt the scholar as he attains his Harvard education and goes on to author numerous books of history and the natural world. We see Roosevelt the adventurer whose hunting trips and pursuit of thieves in the wild west leave one breathless. Most importantly, we see Roosevelt the man as he struggles to win the hearts of two women and raise a family in the midst of an immense historical backdrop. This is a towering work of biography. Simply put, there is a reason this book won the Pulitzer Prize.

In writing 'Stranger in a Strange land' Heinlein created a masterwork- a science fiction spin on the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Like Christ, 'Stranger's protagonist, Micheal Valintine Smith, points out the hypocracy of the popular religion of the time. He teaches the world to give up the rigid protocals of religion and embrace mankind's most powerful emotion: Love. 'Stranger' is populated with characters in the rich Heinlein tradition. Jubal Harshaw, the kindly sage who acts as Smith's protecter, is the laywer/doctor/philosipher/writer/soldier/rogue that brings to mind another Heinlein character, Lazarus Long, from Heinlein's 'future history.' 'Stranger' is must reading for all science-fiction fans and a remarkable look at just how close contemparary society and a religious dictatorship could be. Magnificent.

After reading Arthur C. Clarke's short story 'The Sentinal,' filmaker Stanely Kubrick enlisted the author's aide in creating what he deemed the 'perverbial good science-fiction movie.' The result of this great collaberation was '2001: A Space Odyssey.' The novel, which came out after the movie but was created at the same time, is a stirring tale of human evolution, exploration, and hope. The story begins with our ape-like progenitors and their discovery of a odd object- a black monolith, that boosts their IQ to a level that will promote thier evolution. Fast forward three million years: NASA discovers a strange object- a black monolith, buried beneath the lunar surface. When the sun hits it for the first time in three million years it sends a signal across the solar system. The expedition that follows is filled with hope, but will it succeed? The novel does have several minor differences from the 1968 film- for instance the planet of destination is Saturn, not Jupiter. But if you have seen the film and are a little confused as to what the monolith is and just what transformation the astronaut Bowman underwent, the book will answer you questions. A marvel of science-ficton!

John Keegan's "The First World War" is an effective overview of the 1914-1918 war. Hitting the key events with a perfect mix of detail and pace, Keegan presents a flowing narrative that is both extremely educational and greatly entertaining. At just over 400 pages of text, Keegan never gets bogged down in any one battle or national experience. That is not to say that Keegan ignores or simplifies important episodes of the war. For instance, his examinations of the French Mutinies of 1917 and the growing desperation of a starving Germany in late 1918 are first rate. His presentations of battles such as the Marne, the Somme, Verdun, Tannenberg, and others are all wonderfully fleshed out and informative. If you're looking for deep insight into any one leader or government, look elsewhere. If you're looking a grand, easy to read narrative of the whole war, which does indeed contain many new and critical insights, Keegan's book is sure to delight.

It's been over thirty years since Gerald Reitlinger's 'The SS. Alibi of a nation, 1922-45' was published and yet it still remains one of the most informative and important books on the subject of Nazi Germany and the SS. In 1945-6 the Nuremburg court ruled that the SS was a criminal organization and membership itself was a crime. Reitlinger argues that this was a mistake- in criminalizing this one organization, the court all but absolved the other bureacratic agencies that contributed no less assiduously to the 'Final Solution,' and provided a nation that willingly followed Hitler with the ultimate scapegoat. Throughout the book the reader is introduced to lesser known, though no less responsible, members of Hitler's Reich- Martin Luther, Walter Schellenberg, and Gottlieb Berger are just some of the every-day bureacrats that allowed such terror to reign supreme in Germany for twelve years. Truly a great work of history.

'A Canticle for Leibowitz' is the story of a Catholic Monastary in the Utah desert after a Nuclear Holocaust. The story spans one thousand years and deals with the monks' attempts to preserve human knowledge against the barbarous dark age that had decended upon the Earth. This is one of those rare novels that combines biting satire with a wonderful story and rich characters. There are a few times when the story tends to get bogged down, but these lulls are more than made up for by genuine thrilling moments and a very satisfying ending. Religion, philosiphy, and humor illustrate this wonderful novel of mankind searching for collective redemption and wondering at just what cost salvation will come.

In 'Debt of Honor' Jack Ryan is called by the President to be his National Security Advisor, and not a moment to soon. In Japan ruthless terrorist elements, still smarting over the defeat of the Japanese empire in World War Two, make a bold decision: Attack the U.S. Thier first goal is to construct a small nuclear arsenal, then lauch a daring attack agianst U.S. holdings in the Pacific, and finally to create an economic crisis in the United States that will make the Great Depression look like a day in the park. When all this comes to bare it is up to Jack Ryan to set things right or give in to the outrageous japanese demands. And like Clancy's other great thriller, 'The Sum of All Fears,' this novel's ending is one of the greatest ever written, setting the stage beautifully for the next novel in the series, 'Executive Orders.' All in all 'Debt of Honot' is a thrilling read from the master of modern techno-literature!

I read Len Deighton's work 'Blood, Tears, and Folly,' several years ago and found it to be an insightful and educational look at the early period of the Second World War. His other book, 'Blitzkrieg,' takes an even closer look at the development of German armor tactics during that same period. While the first hundred pages or so focuses more on the political situation in Germany during Hitler's reign, the bulk of the work, which explores the theories of such armoroed proponents as J.F.C. Fuller, B.H. Liddel Hart, and Heinz Guderian, makes for an account both unique and extremely helpful to those seeking to understand just how Germany conquered so much, so quickly, in the first years of the war. A great work!

In 'Winter' Len Deighton not only tells a riveting story, but skillfully depicts the era of the Wiemar Republic and Nazi Germany. Dieghton's protagonists, Peter and Puali Winter, show two very different views of the events of the time. While Pauli embraces the Nazi Revolution, Peter is skeptical. Thier points of view ultimatly allow readers to understand the moral and ethical questions the people of Germany had to ask at the time. Wonderful.

"Battle Royale: The Complete Collection" is a very good box set edition for this title. The films themselves are very dark, but look absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.The first film, set in a dystopian future Japan where adults fear unruly children, sees one middle school class of 40+ students sent to a deserted island and each teenager is given only one objective- be the last one standing. Given various weapons like guns, knives, crossbows, and even poor "weapons" such as a pot lid and binoculars, the students engage in an orgy of blood as they turn on each other in their quest for survival. Some students, however, reject the blood sport and seek a way around the violence by embracing compassion. A dark, gory film that treads a dangerous line of glorifying violence, this film is not for everyone.The sequel takes on an interesting premise, and doesn't merely repeat the formula of the first film. Unfortunately, the direction it takes is not nearly as intense or engaging as the original. Still, fans of the first film will enjoy the continuation of the story and the copious amounts of blood.Not entirely original, these films borrow heavily from such science-fiction, war, and coming-of-age films as "Lord of the Flies", "The Running Man", "Red Dawn", and "Taps", and of course I doubt it's a coincidence that this set is being released around the same time as the major Hollywood production of "The Hunger Games" is set to open. Superficially, "Battle Royale" and "The Hunger Games" sound a lot alike.If you enjoy coming of age and dystopian tales, and are not put off by a virtual blood-bath in every other frame, you might enjoy checking out this treat from Japan.

'All Quiet on the Western Front' is truly an amazing novel of war, despair, and youth destroyed by circumstance. Much more than simply a story set in the trenches of World War One, it is a graphic illustration of a young man's journey from optimism to anguish. The author is truly a master of the written word and even the translation into English cannot diminish his literary skill. If anyone wishes to have a better understanding of the generation that served and bled in the holocaust of the trenches this novel will deliver. A rare blend of story, character, and language make 'All Quiet on the Western Front' truly a timeless classic.

Churchill's 'History of the English Speaking People's' is presented as all history should be presented- with a keen understanding of the events as they unfolded, an amazing ability to convey the motivations and passions of the people involved, and with a profound wit. Churchill effortlessly tells us the story of England from it's earliest settlement to the eve of World War I. His insights into such events as the Boer War, the Conflicts with Napoleon, and the American Civil War are unparrelled. If you want to learn more of how the Anglo-American world came to be this four volume set is more than worth a look.

Everything that I loved about Forester's Hornblower novels is found in 'The Captain From Connecticut.' From brilliant sea battles, to duels of honor, to personal fears, this is a novel in great Forester tradition. The plot centers on the sea war between America and England in the closing months of the conflict. After the French Monarchy has been restored the new republic fears the full weight of the British Empire will come to bear on it. It is at this desperate time in the history of the United States that the novel's protaganist, Captain Peabody, must make a daring escape from the British blockade in order to threaten British interests in the Caribbean. Make no mistake, though, this is not simply a Hornblower knock-off. Captain Peabody is an original creation that could only come from the mind of a master story teller. For anyone interested in warfare in the age of the sail this is must reading and fans of great adventure will no doubt love it too.

Frederick Forsyth's novel, 'The Day of the jackel,' is one of the all time great suspense thrillers, if not the best. 'Jackel' is the story of a army officer plot to assassinate the President of France, Charles De Gaulle, in the early sixties. Disappointed over De Gualle's decision to withdraw French troops from Algeria, several army officers hire a resourceful international assassin, code named 'Jackel,' to do away with him in the hopes of bringing down the government. French authorities get wind of the plot and put thier top investigator on the case. The tale that follows is one of excitment and suspense as the Jackel uses all of his cunning to outwit his French opponents and to get close enough to De Gaulle. This is certainly the best suspense novel I have ever read and I would definatly recommend it to anyone! Fantastic!

Walter R. Borneman's "1812, The War That Forged A Nation" is a readable and well-written account of one of America's least understood conflicts. The book begins and ends with the political moves in both Washington and London that brought about the war, but the bulk of the narrative is operational and tactical history. The emphasis on the military side of the conflict at the expense of the political side may be off-putting for some readers who enjoy a greater context and are happy with only brief descriptions of armies marching. This is not to say that Borneman's account is completely lacking in political considerations. Indeed, his chapter on the Hartford Convention is very illuminating, but the soul of this book is very much military history. Borenman's accounts of America's naval wars in the Atlantic and upon the great lakes are first rate, as is his description of the great land battles in Canada and the British burning of Washington D.C. Perhaps the best reading in this book is his clear, straight-forward account of the battle of New Orleans. One can almost smell the powder and blood in the air as the British made the same mistake before Jackson's position as Robert E. Lee was to make at Gettysburg nearly fifty years later with Pickett's Charge. While occasionally prone to offering flourishes that come of as a little less than scholarly, Borenman nevertheless largely succeeds in presenting this chapter in American history.

'The Hunt For Red October' is without a doubt one of the most suspencful adventure stories in modern literature. The plot involves a Russian nuclear submarine captian who defects, with the boat, to the USA during the height of the cold war. I had seen the movie before reading the book and was surprised at just how much more complex the novel is. In addition to it being Clancy's first novel, it is the first appearence of Jack Ryan. This Clancy character is the backbone of nearly all his novels and is a hero that you can't help but root for. A wonderful introduction into the novels of Tom Clancy.

David McCullough's "John Adams" is an amazing look at one of the most important figures in the American Revolution and the early republic. McCullough's prose is always engaging and his research is always astounding.McCullough's portrait of Adams is a one of an ambitious, gifted, intellectual, yet deeply troubled and doubt-ridden figure. From his quest to persuade the Continental Congress to declare independence from Great Britain, to his tireless efforts in support of General Washington, to his frustrating tenure as vice president, to his even more frustrating tenure as president, and finally to his political retirement, this book is fascinating.Particularly enlightening, and often moving, is McCullough's chronicle and interpretation of Adams' relationships. In many ways this book is just as much a biography of Abigail Adams, the strong wife whose wise council often prodded him to action and reconsider his own positions. Adams' relationship with Thomas Jefferson also makes up an amazing portion of this work. One time political allies drifted toward enemies as America began to take shape as a real political entity under George Washington's presidency. The pair's reconciliation as old men and their unlikely concurrent deaths on the 50th anniversary of their greatest political achievement read almost as great fiction. But this is great history told by a truly great historian.By all means one should check out the fine "John Adams" mini-series on HBO, which was based on this book, but not as a substitute to reading it. McCullough justifiably won the Pulitzer prize for this work, a book that deserves a place on a shelf in every home in America.

"Inside Hitler's High Command" is a brilliant look at how Hitler and his generals operated in World War II. Hitler's overriding desire not just to command, but to personally dominate his generals is evident as the German command function is amazingly recreated by author Geoffrey P. Megargee. Megargee offers us a typical week in the command life of Hitler and his generals (as much as any week in those days could be considered typical). These sections make for some of the book's most fascinating and readable pages. One goes back and forth between grudging admiration for German military technical abilities, and a sense that everything was just hanging by a thread and waiting to fall apart. Hitler's meddling, his generals sniveling subservience, the vastness and barbarity of the Russian operation, and the dogged determination and intelligence of the Allies all spelled the Third Reich's doom. Megargee's work is a fine piece of historical scholarship that expresses these wartime realities skillfully.

B. H. Liddel Hart's book, "The German Generals Talk", or "The Other Side of the Hill" as it was known in Britain, is his published account of a series of interviews with many German Generals after World War II. The book is simply fascinating. By now most students of the German army are familiar with the German side of the war, but nevertheless it is interesting to hear just what they had to say for themselves. Hart certainly was no objective observer. He willingly went along with many of the generals attempts to clear the honor of the German Wehrmacht from the stains of its atrocities. Hart even lauded Guderian as a paragon of German honor. Of course Guderian was expected to site Hart as one of his inspirations when developing panzer tactics. I would heartily recommend this work, though I'd also tell the reader to check out Ronald Smelser and Edward Davies II's book, "The Myth of the Eastern Front, The Nazi-Soviet War in American Popular Culture" for a better understanding of just how the historical record was fudged.

'Long Before Forty' is C. S. Forester's superbly written and wonderfully compelling autobiography. The first hundred pages deal with his growing up in England, his schoolboy adventures, and the beginnings of the thought process that would lead to his magnificent literary career. Next, Forester details his heartbreak and triumph as a budding writer. The third act of this wonderful work deals with the step-by-step, nuts-and-bolts way in which Forester constructed many of his most famous works, including the fantastic Hornblower series. This is a book for anyone who loves the author's thrilling novels and short stories, as well as for anyone who wishes to learn more about what it takes to write and not give up!

For anyone interested in Napoleonic history Bernard Cornwell's 'Richard Sharpe' series will amaze and delight. 'Waterloo' is a wonderful tribute to the those who fought the famous battle and a thrilling adventure for Richard Sharpe. In 'Waterloo,' Sharpe fights not only the forces of Napoleon, but the young and inexperienced commander of the Dutch troops as well as his wife's cowardly lover. From the tense moments as French troops cross the border, to thrashing of the British at Quatre Bras, to the slaughter of Ney's cavalry on the British squares, to Wellington's near-run triumph, this is a magnificent blending of historical fact and captivating fiction. 'Waterloo' may be Cornwell's best.

Robert A. Heinlein is unquestionably the greatest Science Fiction writer of all time. For anyone who doubts that this statement is true then you haven't read 'Time Enough For Love.' 'Time' is the story of Lazarus Long, a human being who was born in the early twentieth century but simply doesn't die. By the 42nd century, however, Lazarus has had enough. Having been 'rescued' from an attempted suicide Lazarus tells his story to one of his many decendants and finally embarks upon a quest of staggering dimensions all to keep from simply being bored. Throughout this novel the voice of the author is heard. From his sage wisdom to matters of simple common sense, Heinlein speaks through his creation with honesty, sentiment, and of course his trademark wit. The many other characters that populate this work are no less interesting. From a spaceship that longs to be human to Lazarus' own geneticly cloned sisters, these are characters in the rich Heinlein tradition. Heinlein also provides us with pages all dedicated to favorite sayings of his protagonist. These 'Notebooks of Lazarus Long,' of which another, beautifully illustrated book was created, make this novel worth reading alone. 'Time Enough For Love,' is one of those rare works of fiction that makes you laugh, cry, and most important of all, think. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good Science Fiction or lovers of imagination in general.

While Heinz Guderian's memoirs of his Second World War experience add an important volume in our understanding of the war and the Third Reich, one must never forget who was writing it. Guderian is at his best, and hopefully most trustworthy, when he sticks to battle plans and tactics. When he writes as the ultimate gambler of the French and Russian campaigns, one can almost smell the sweat and gunpowder from the battlefield. In this regard, "Panzer Leader" is a very enlightening and important book.Unfortunately, there is much of the story that is simply not here. Guderian never shies away from presenting himself as the father of modern tank warfare, though he fails to credit the many other German officers of the panzer arm who worked tirelessly alongside him to bring the weapon into the modern age. He is quick to criticize those with whom he disagreed during the war, unwilling to acknowledge his own mistakes with any real regret or offer anyone else the lions share of accolades for German victories in which he played a part.But most disturbing of all is Guderian's complete unwillingness to open up about the Wehrmacht's role in Eastern Front atrocities or his own corruption. Like many officers of the German Army, Guderian accepted bribes from Hitler, including a large estate in German-dominated Poland. Guderian constantly paints himself as the apolitical military technical specialist, but in fact in the aftermath of the July 20th bomb plot against Hitler (during which he was conveniently incommunicado), he stated to the German Army that every officer needed to be a National Socialist Officer. It was he who insisted that the Nazi stiff arm salute replace the traditional military salute. His actions reveal a man who was very much political.As a war memoir it is enjoyable, even essential to the serious student, but must be read with a grain of salt. For a more detailed and honest portrait of Guderian check out Russell A. Hart's brief biography, "Guderian: Panzer Pioneer or Myth Maker?". Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies II's "The Myth of the Eastern Front: The Nazi-Soviet War in American Popular Culture" details how generals like Guderian were able to rehabilitate themselves after the war largely through memoirs like this.

Such great hopes were invested in the Paris peace conference of 1919 that it could in no way realistically live up to them. Lloyd George and Clemenceau were determined to make Germany pay through the teeth while Wilson, initially hailed to be the world's new savior, ultimately proved too politically inept to ensure his grand vision. This fascinating piece of diplomatic history is expertly chronicled and interpreted by a first-rate talent. Margaret MacMillan's book "Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World" brilliantly explores this era of great expectations and even greater disappointments. MacMillan offers sections dealing with France, Britain, the USA and virtually every other nation or region that participated in the conference. In this bungled attempt to create a stable and secure post-war world one can easily see the grave injustices that befell Germany, which was in reality no more or less to blame than any other of the Great Powers in starting World War I. The sections dealing with the German delegation, which never in its wildest dreams considered so harsh a peace, are particularly captivating. Their initial cautious hopes gave way suddenly to the stark realization that Britain and France intended the treaty to be a chain around Germany's neck that would prevent it from rising again. Even Wilson could not mitigate the wrath of the victors. The miscalculations at Versailles did not bring peace, but only ensured the rise of a true evil in Germany several years later.Throughout this book MacMillan presents the players in all of their flawed glory and offers a greater understanding of just how so many with good intentions screwed up so badly. There are lessons here that current leaders would do well to learn. Recommended.

The second novel of Harry Turtledove's 'Colonization' series, 'Down to Earth,' is better than 'Second Contact,' but only just. The four major powers, America, the Soviet Union, the German Reich, and the alien Lizards still eye each other with distrust across a planet and in outer space. Like most Turtledove novels the interesting plot is often times negated by the scope of the overall story. It's far too long and there are just too many characters to keep straight to make this one of the author's better novels, (think 'Guns of the South.') Also, too often the alternate history story is sacrificed for the sake of it's science fiction aspects. There are a few moments where Turtledove gives us some food for thought: Power struggles in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, America with something to hide, and a stunning climax that hopefully will lead to some interesting situations in the next volume. Here's hoping that Turtledove will start writing more straight alternate history novels with fewer characters, (once again, think 'Guns of the South.')

'Executive Orders' makes a strong case for being Clancy's greatest novel. Dealing with the beginnning of Jack Ryan's Presidency, 'Orders' has Ryan coming to grips with his new situation as chief executive while battling foreign and domestic enemies who seek to undermine the USA. One of the greatest aspects of Clancy's novels is the optimism in America that they inspire. 'Orders' in no exception. Thrilling in it's action, daring in it's philosiphy, and just a lot of fun, this is truly a great modern American novel. No-it's not high art, but it is what it is- A wonderful novel by Tom Clancy.

In "History of the German General Staff, 1657-1945" Walter Gorlitz traces the rise of the Prussian/German military establishment and its groundbreaking General Staff system. The book manages to capture the scope of the subject in a well-paced and well-written narrative that is impressive in such a relatively small volume. Gorlitz's views on the evolution of the General Staff system from its beginnings under the Prussian reformers through its Imperial heyday and finally to its marginalization and decline in the Third Reich make for fascinating reading. If anything, there wasn't enough on the Second World War, though this is a minor point for such a wonderful book. Those who like it should also check out Trevor N. Dupuy's "A Genius for War", also on the German General Staff.

'Shapre's Gold' is another wonderful novel in the great Napoleonic war series. This time, Richard Sharpe is up against the French, Spanish paritsans, and Wellington's own military police. Wellington, desperate to defend his hold on Portugal, sends Sharpe on a special errand into Spain to collect hidden gold. Along the way Sharpe Sharpe falls in love with one of the partisans and manages to make an enemy of her intended husband. This, like most of Cornwell's Sharpe novels, is a novel that can take the reader back in time and place him at the heart of the action. The battle scenes, as usual, are first rate and Cornwell's ability to create characters is unmatched. If you love adventure or war novels this one will not dissappoint!

This book provides a good introduction to the British Army Generals of the Second World War and the theaters in which they served. Each essay is a concise, well written look at the men who fought the Axis powers while at the same time had to deal with rivalries within their own service, dealing with the American and French allies, and had to contend with the dominating personality of Winston Churchill. Generals Slim and Wingate perhaps come off as the best British fighting generals of the war, battling the Japanese in Burma with intelligence and ability. Montgomery comes across a bit more sympathetic than American students of the war are used to seeing him. In all, Keegan has assembled a group of first-rate historians to provide these portraits.

Not nearly as thrilling or full of adventure as Forester's 'Hornblower' novels, 'The Good Shephard' is nevertheless a stirring tale of action, suspense, and human drama played out in the North Atlantic during WWII. Captain Krause, a character of similar attitude as the doubt-ridden Hornblower, is in command of a convoy bound for England. His foe is the Kriegsmarine with it's deadliest weapon, the U-boat. Throughout the story Krause must battle the Germans along with his own fatigue and self-doubt. While this novel doesn't quite live up to the 'Hornblower' standard (like 'Captain from Connecticut' or 'The Nightmare'), it nevertheless manages to capture the same tense feelings and gripping drama that made 'Hornblower' Forester's trademark.

W. Cleon Skousen's book 'The Naked Communist' is one of the finest works ever written on the subject of the communist conspiracy and should be read by everyone who loves the United States of America. Skousen does a wonderful job exposing the lies that communists have used since Karl Marx first wrote the communist manifesto. The book was written in the early sixties and it's amazing to see just how many predictions Skousen made that have come true. Skousen also points out the many flaws that has left the United Nations virtually powerless to stop aggressor nations. But perhaps the most interesting facts that Skousen sheds light on are the circumstances surrounding Roosevelt's concessions to Stalin and Truman's concessions to Mao. These 'Appeasers' made the same mistakes that Chamberlin made in his dealing's with Hitler in the 1930's. Many are quick to dismiss the spectre of Communism since the end of the cold war but America must remain ever vigilant and always beware the influences of the EXTREME left.

Mark Frost's "The List of Seven" is a wonderful supernatural horror fest set in London in the late 19th century. The protagonist is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose dabbling into spiritualism and the black arts lead him on a maddening quest to stop evil from taking root upon the Earth. He soon hooks up with a Sherlock Holmes type adventurer for whom Conan Doyle plays Watson. The story is fast-paced and contains enough eerie ambiance to provide chills throughout. The ending of this book is a little predictable, but nevertheless awesome. From start to finish this book is very readable, even un-put-downable. If you enjoy a good horror novel you might want to check out "The List of Seven".

John Erickson's "The Road to Stalingrad" is a meticulously written, detail rich work of military history. This dense volume illuminates the tragedies and triumphs of Stalin's war machine from the outbreak of Barbarossa on June 22, 1941 until the victory of the Red Army at Stalingrad in early 1943. This is not a volume for the casual reader wishing to learn more about the Soviet experience in World War Two, but it and its sister volume proved essential when writing my Master's Thesis on the Nazi and Soviet command structures during the war. If you want a deep analysis of Stalin and his commanders at war, then check out this and the second volume, Erickson's "The Road to Berlin."

C.S. Forester never fails to tell an exciting tale and 'Lord Hornblower', the 9th novel in the series, is one of the best. Centering on the time around the treaty of Fontainebleau and up through the hundred days and Waterloo, 'Lord Hornblower' has the recently made K.C.B. Hornblower dispactched to deal with a mutinous crew at sea. Eventually, the peace with France allows Hornblower to visit those who sheltered him there during the war. But when Napolean returns to lead France once again, Hornblower finds himself leading a band of partisans against the restored Emperor. This is the last Hornblower novel to take place during the wars and it is a more than fitting end to Hornblower's own battle with Napolean.

The Marx Brothers were arguably the greatest comic act of the century and 'The Marx Brothers Scrapbook' brings the heart and soul of the great performers to life. With engaging interviews, hirlarous anecdotes, and moving glimpses into the brother's lives, this book is a must for any die-hard Marx fan. Especially remarkable is the look author Anibole gives us of Groucho in his latter years. Fantastic!

'The Man in the High Castle' is a wonderful, terror filled novel of what the world would have been like had the allies lost World War Two. In the novel the Nazis control the US from the east coast to about the Rocky Mountians while Japan holds California, Oregon, and Washington. What's left in the middle is what's left of the United States. The plot centers around a Nazi high official's visit to his Japanese opposite number in San Fransico. The nature of this visit could determine the fate of North America, and the rest of the World. Along the way Dick gives us plenty of food for thought: A Japanese obsession with the old west, A power struggle between Josef Goebbels and Reinhard Heydrich, A civilisation that embraces the 'I, Ching,' instead of the Bible, and the lengths that a Jew must go to simply to stay alive in a world where to be different is the greatest crime. The book was written in the early sixties and contains a few too many science-fictiony ideas: the Mediteranean Sea drained and used as farmland, moonbases and advanced spaceflight. Although you must blink your eyes at these few distractions, the book is a lot of fun and makes wonder just what life would have been like in an American Reich.

F. Paul Wilson's apocalyptic vampire novel "Midnight Mass", is an expansion of his short story of the same name. The novel carries the story of vampires dominating the east coast of the United States after taking over all of Europe. The Vampires, in league with their human collaborators, round up and use the remaining humans as food. When a few people find the courage to fight the vampiric invasion they first must wrestle with questions of morality and faith before they can begin to combat the supernatural enemy. Generally entertaining, this book offers a fun journey into a world falling apart as dark forces reign supreme. Read the book but at all costs avoid the low-budget film based on the short story.

Gilbert's one volume biography 'Churhcill: A Life' is a remarkable study of the man who contributed so much to the cause of liberty and to the world of literature. Churchill's life is traced with all the power, wit, and determination that marked Britain's famed war and peacetime Prime Minister. Gilbert's account succeeds on many levels, but perhaps the most illuminating are the portraits he gives us of Churchill during the First World War and in his second Priemership. Churchill's frustration with the government over their unwillingness to clear his name after the Dardenelles fiasco makes for riviting reading and the old man's stubborn refusal to resign from the Prime Ministership in the early fifies gives a unique glimpse into the heart of this great man. Gilbert also gives us a wonderful look at Chruchill the writer as his process of creating his wonderful histories and biographies is examined. Throughtout this work, Gilbert presents Churchill objectivly, but still with a real, personal warmness. Reading the accounts of Chruchill's death at the end of the book make one feel as though they have lost a friend. Winston Churchill was undoubtedly one of the century's most critical figures- he was the man who beat Hitler- but for a personal, deeply moving account Gilbert's work is one that is not to be missed.

International terrorism is the topic Clancy tackles in his novel, 'Patriot Games.' When history teacher and sometime CIA anylist Jack Ryan intervenes in an IRA hit on the Prince of Wales, he soon finds himself a political target. When his family is attacked in Baltimore Ryan again goes to work for the CIA in the hopes of stopping the terrorists. While the story is gripping and the action scenes fast-paced and exciting, the first two hundred pages of the book are for the most part slow. If you're a patient reader you should get through it okay. The ending is a climax in the great Clancy tradition and the characters, as always, are people you'd like to know. There is much more in the book than in the movie, but it's essentially the same story. On the whole it's a great first ride for Jack Ryan.

Gordianus the Finder gives up the big city and retires to a country estate where he hopes to leave Roman politics behind him for good in Steven Saylor's "Catilina's Riddle". Unfortunately for the Roman detective scheming neighbors, the politician Catilina, and the consul Cicero all work to destroy his hoped for peace and solicitude. When a headless body appears in Gordianus' stable, he must use all of his deductive powers to understand who is responsible and what the murder has to do with Rome's political future. While not as engaging as "Roman Blood" and "Arms of Nemesis", "Catilina's Riddle" is nevertheless a wonderful mystery set in the final days of the Roman Republic. As is the case with all of the Roma Sub Rosa series, this novel highlights Saylor's knowledge and understanding of the Roman world. Though a little slow at times, fans of the series will no doubt have a field day.

While 'The Eagle Has Flown' is considerably weaker than the 'The Eagle Has Landed,' it nevertheless is a great adventure story that takes the reader through the underworld of World War Two espionage. At times it almost mimics 'Landed' in it's characters and situations, and the ending is not terribly credible to anyone who has studied the Nazi structure. But despite this, 'The Eagle Has Flown' is a wonderful story in the great Jack Higgin's tradition.

The inspiration for the film "Hellraiser", Clive Barker's "The Hellbound Heart" is a chilling voyage into the furthest reaches of human darkness, and a fearful visit into hell itself. The heart of this story is something easily relatable and rooted in the banality of daily life- an unhappy marriage. When the forces of darkness intrude upon this common wretchedness hell itself is unleashed upon the Earth and consumes the miserable couple and their daughter. The demons, or Cenobites as they are known, are beings from the netherworld for whom pain and pleasure are indistinguishable. Barker succeeds in creating a terrifying vision of hell on Earth within the confines of a completely credible story. The film "Hellraiser" was generally faithful to this novella, but there is something deeply disturbing in Barker's writing that is both poetic and haunting. If you enjoy well-written horror then check this one out.

John Keegan's "The Iraq War" is less a blow by blow account of the military campaign against Saddam's Iraq as it is a general history of Saddam's regime and its wars. Keegan looks at the history of Iraq before Saddam and examines its place within the Middle East as Arab nationalist movements take root. Saddam is painted as a bitter, brilliant, ambitious, and ultimately psychopathic dictator whose penchant for underestimating his enemies and supreme confidence in his own flawed judgments led Iraq toward disaster.Saddam's wars of aggression against Iran and Kuwait are expertly detailed by a master military historian. In addition to the military aspects of the wars, Keegan offers a keen insight into their political origins and resolutions as well. Keegan deftly presents Saddam's motives and and judgments in each conflict and how they influenced his actions in the next.Keegan's presentation of the 2003 Iraq War offers similar insights. The run up to the war and the preparations against Iraq are examined. Bush and Blair are presented as diligent statesmen, acting on credible evidence of a threat to the Western world from Iraq. Those looking for a treatise packed with Bush-bashing will be disappointed. To be sure, Keegan offers mistakes that these men and others made in the US and Britain, but on the whole it's pretty obvious that Keegan supported the decision for war in 2003 and offers important arguments for this position. The military operations are again detailed with supreme precision and insight. The reader marvels at the ability of the US-British led military to take on Saddam's still credible war machine with such a relatively small force, a force not supported by nearly the numbers of nations that joined the coalition in 1991. Keegan also writes of the lingering effects of the war in the US and Britain, and offers his notes from a post-war interview with US General Tommy Franks.The scope of this book does not quite fit the title. At just over 200 pages of text one expects this work to be primarily a study of the 2003 Iraq War. Rather, this work presents a grand overview of Iraq's regime under Saddam and its wars. This book also fails to fully consider the insurgency that followed the main military operations. A greater perspective on this issue would have added considerably to this work. Still, these are small complaints compared to what this book does offer.

Anthony Everitt's biography "Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" is a a fine and penetrating look into the life of the Roman statesman. Everitt mines classical works with a master's skill in order to provide a portrait not only of the man, but also of a society pushed to the brink, a civilization teetering on the abyss.Everitt presents Rome in all its grandeur and horror, its nobility and its depravity, its culture and its decadence. Examining the fundamental issues of the day such as land reform and a restless military culture, Everitt offers Cicero as a man struggling against history. Cicero is shown desperately trying to preserve the Roman Constitution against abuses by dynamic and charismatic soldier/politicians. The temptation to draw parallels with Rome of Cicero's day and the current political problems of the USA is irresistible, if ultimately futile. History, after all, is not a grab bag in which you can pick analogies to suit any argument. Each situation is different and unique. While the failure of the Roman Republic may yet be emulated by America, the USA's fall would be triggered by its own unique challenges. Having said that, however, there is still much current politicians and citizens could learn from the failure of Cicero and his compatriots to maintain their honored Constitution. And one must ALWAYS be wary of the new, dynamic, charismatic figure on the political stage.Cicero's relationships are key in Everitt's analysis. His friendship with Atticus, his relationships with his brother, son, nephew and wives are all thoroughly examined, many through letters written to and by Cicero. But the complex dynamics of his political dealings are the most intriguing. Through Cicero's conservative eyes we see the great figures of the day as they play out the great tragedy: Crassus, Brutus, Pompey, Octavian, and of course, Caesar. The Machiavellian scheming behind the scenes makes for fascinating reading, and again makes one wonder if this is how deals are struck in Washington today.In all, this is a wonderful biography and an important tool for examining the age. The 2nd President of the United States, John Adams, frequently cited Cicero as his political and philosophical hero. Along with David McCullough's biography of that president, Everitt's Cicero should be required reading in all American schools.

'Sharpe's Siege' is a wonderful novel in Bernard Cornwell's multi-volumed work. This time Sharpe is under orders to take a French coastal fort with the help of the British navy. Eventually, Sharpe finds himself stranded in the fort thanks to the machinations of his old nemisis Pierre Ducos. With his back to the sea Sharpe adopts, what else, a cunning strategy to deafeat the French and save his men. A real highlight in the series and lot of fun.

There are times throughout the course of history when a political/military leader refuses to believe the facts before him when they conflict with his pre-conceived notions. Some examples are the Johnson administration's refusal to believe that Vietnam would be a long, hard war that ultimately wouldn't work. Another is the supreme arrogance of Douglas MacArthur who repeatedly stated that that the Chinese would not enter the Korean War to bail out their communist allies.But the award for the ultimate in political blindness goes to Josef Stalin who ignored the vast apparatus of Soviet and Communist intelligence and chose to believe that Adolf Hitler wouldn't dare attack the Soviet union in the summer of 1941. Stalin's refusal to listen to his agents throughout Europe and his agencies at home led to the most devastating surprise attack in history- the German attack of June 22, 1941.David E. Murhpy's detailed account of Stalin's unwillingness to accept the facts is an amazing look into one man's ultimate arrogance. Murphy examines all of the avenues through which Josef Stalin was informed of the Nazi attack, and his rock-like stubbornness and refusal to act. Particular interesting are the documents Murhpy provides which appear to be letters from Hitler himself, assuring the Soviet dictator of German loyalty to the non-aggression pact and explaining seemingly hostile troop movements as part of an overall military deception and campaign to take down Britain once and for all. These documents, which even Murhpy cannot substantially validate, could if true be the key to understanding Stalin's actions in 1941."What Stalin Knew: The Enigma of Barbarossa" is must reading for students of the Eastern Front in World War II. Casual readers will find a relatively easy read in these pages and will walk away with a greater understanding of Soviet intelligence, military, and political considerations of the era.

I first read 'Inside the the Third Reich' at age 19 and the message of this book has been with me ever since. Quite simply it is a true fable of evil corrupting good. Throughout Speer's early account one almost feels that this could be anyone, at anytime. Only as world events change at an astouding pace around him, are we reminded that Speer lived in a Germany that was soon to be the home to one of the greatest evils the world had ever known. Speer tells us of the fateful night he first heard Hitler speak, and how he joined the Nazi party bare hours later. The portrait Speer paints of Hitler is not one of the evil demegouge that history would prove him to be, but rather one of an inspired leader who was doing all he could to lift his nation out of economic ruin and national despair. It was this illusion that Hitler projected that allowed good and honorable men, like Speer, to be corrupted. This is an entertaining book for any amatuer historian, and more, a very important one for anyone who wonders how a nation of philosiphers, and Christians, aritists and engineers, could sell it's very soul to evil.

'The Sum of All Fears' starts off rather slowly. The beginning deals with Jack Ryan's headaches as the number two man in the CIA and waging political battles with the President and members of his cabinet. Meanwhile, around the world, communist-arab-native American terrorists recieve manna from heaven- an atomic bomb. While most of the novel deals with preparing the bomb and Ryan's own personal and proffesional problems, The last two hundred pages are among the most thrilling ever written. The terrorists' atomic bomb is only the begginning of a much larger plan to bring the world, not just the USA, to it's knees. The payoff of this novel makes the whole thing worth while. In addition it acts almost as a manual for creating your own atomic weapons, should the need arise.

Robert Harris' novel, 'Fatherland,' is simply brilliant. Set in a world where Germany won World War Two, 'Fatherland,' is an amazing murder mystery that will keep you guessing right up to the end. SS Sturmbannfuhrer Xavier March is assigned to the case when a body appears along the banks of the Havel. When March learns the identity of the body, a high-ranking Nazi in Poland during the war, the Gestpo order him off the case. Unwilling to stop looking for answers, March takes on the head of the Gestapo, General Globus, in an attempt to unravel a mystery that dates all the way back to World War Two. What makes this novel truly riveting is the subtle way Harris incorperates the reality we all know into the nightmare world of a victorious Nazi Germany. It's easy to see traces of Martin Cruz Smith's 'Gorky Park' in this work, the two novels are very similar, but 'Fatherland' is much more exciting. Both as a smart mystery story and a condemnation of totalitarianism this novel delivers! This is easily the best alternate history novel I have ever read!

Gordon R. Dickson's Dorsai novels rank among the great novels of Science-Fiction and 'The Final Encyclopedia' is no exception. Indeed, 'Encyclopedia' is on par with other such epics of the genre as Frank Herbert's 'Dune' and Issac Asimov's 'Foundation.' 'Encyclopedia' is the tale of Hal Mayne, a fully-evolved human being who knows what path humanity must take if it is to survive and flourish. But before he can implement his plans, he must bide his time as he makes his way throughout the sixteen colonized worlds. But always on Hal's trail is Bleys Ahrens, another fully evolved human who has his own views on how humanity should progress. At the center of this galatic conflict is the Fianl Encyclopedia, a huge space-station in orbit of Earth, that contains all the knowledge of the human race. Whoever controls the Encyclopedia will control the fate of humanity.

As Warsaw is falling to the Nazis Polish officer Alexander de Milja is tasked with taking Polish treasures out of the country. So begins his work in the shadow world of the Second World War. He soon finds himself in Occupied Paris working for Poland's government-in-exile and their British allies. de Milja soon finds himself working on the most important question the allies can come up with: Will Hitler attack the Soviet Union? Furst again displays his command of language and character here, and creates a truly moving story about the realities of wartime espionage. Furst dazzles with his ability to transport the reader back in time to the gritty, unhappy days of the Second World War.

Harry Turtledove's novel 'The Great War: American Front' is the sequal to his earlier novel, 'How Few Remain.' While 'American Front' is another thought provoking alternate history novel it lacks many of the factors that made 'How Few Remain' and Turtledove's other civil war novel, 'The Guns of the South,' truly great works. The characters in 'American Front' are many and it's easy to get them confused. Two characters in the novel are Canadian farmers that seem so similar that it makes one wonder why Turtledove didn't consolidate them into one. Also, unlike 'How Few Remain' and 'Guns of the South,' actual historical characters take a back seat to Turtledove's fictional creations. The basic premise itself, that the Confederate States of America, which won it's independence during the civil war, goes to war with the United States when thier treaty obligations to European powers demand it, is a little hard to swallow. If indeed the south had gained it's independance from the U.S. the economic desparity between the two nations would make it almost impossible for the C.S.A. to keep up with the north. These points aside 'American Front' has it's moments. Turtledove re-creates the Christmas truce that happened on the western front during WWI and transplants it to America. Instead of British and Germans putting aside thier differences during the Christmas season, it's Union and Confederate troops. Also, it is interesting to see all of North America as a battlefield and just how the U.S. would wage a war on it's own soil. If you're new to Turtledove 'The Great War: American Front' is not the best of his novels to start with. 'How Few Remain,' and 'The Guns of the South' are both far superior.

'The Great War: Walk in Hell,' is the continuation of Turledove's story of a divided America which began with 'How Few Remain.' 'Walk' picks up in 1915 while war and revolution explode across both the United States and the Confederate States of America. In the South, the oppressed black minority fights to hold on to the Socialist republic that they have created while in Salt Lake City Mormon extremeists once again challenge the Federal government. At the same time thousands of men die each day in the trenches that separate the two powers. While 'Walk' isn't nearly as entertaining as Turtledove's 'Guns of the South' or 'How Few Remain,' it is considerably better than the novel which precedes this one, 'The Great War: American Front.' In 'Walk' the characters that Turtledove created in 'American Front' are fleshed out and don't seem to be merely there as a means of advancing the plot. Also, the political struggle is exmained a little closer when the U.S. tries to annex captured Confederate territory. If not entierly plausable at times, 'Walk' is nevertheless a fun and entertaining read.

This is the only Gore Vidal novel I've been able to get through but it is itself a fantastic novel of the decline of the Roman empire. Vidal's unusual writing style serves him well as the narrative shifts back and forth from the correspondence of two powerful senators and Julian's own memoirs. The story (how historically accurate I cannot say,) tells the story of the young prince Julian living at the mercy of his dreaded cousin the Emperor. When events come into play he is thrust into the supreme seat of power himself and must combat not only the barabrians to the east, but the empire's own viral infection: Christianity. Julian's attempts to return the empire to the paganism that served it so well in years past is at the very heart of this story. One can certainly feel the court paranoia that prevailed in these troubled times that rivaled the excesses of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. This is a great book and one that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in this era or in the workings of political power in general.

The final novel in the Richard Sharpe series, (thus far,) has retired Lt. Col. Richard Sharpe undertaking a mission to find an old friend in revolutionary Chile. With Patrick Harper at his side Sharpe first visits the isle of St. Helena with it's one tourist attraction: the Emperor Napoleon. After a brief audience with Bonoparte Sharpe heads to Chile where he faces the local Spanish Captain-General Bautista. Eventually Sharpe and Harper throw their lot in with the rebels and their rogue of an Admiral, Lord Cochrane. This novel is yet more proof of Cornwell's ability to tell an exciting story while at the same time evoke with absolute vision the early nineteenth century into the reader's mind. I hope this isn't the last book in the Richard Sharpe novels but if it is it is a fitting ending to a series that rank among the great adventure stories of modern fiction.

"Stalin's Generals", edited by Harold Shukman, is a wonderful collection of essays on the Red Army generals of World War II. Each author brings a real depth of understanding to not only the men, but also the military and political institutions of the Soviet Union of the time. One can gradually follow through many of these pieces the character of Josef Stalin himself. Stalin's transformation from jealous guardian of military power to warlord who actually trusted his officers is a central theme of most of the essays. The essays on Rokossovsky, Zhukov, Koniev, Shaposhnikov and Vasilevsky are particularly insightful and informative. This is a great work for both causal readers and serious students of the Eastern Front in World War II.

Edmund Morris' follow up to "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" is every bit as informative and entertaining. "Theodore Rex" picks up right where the first volume left off, with Roosevelt assuming the presidency after the assassination of President McKinley. Morris brings his considerable skills to bear as he examines Roosevelt's roles in the key issues and events of the day: The Venezuelan Crisis, the Coal Strike, the Panama Canal endeavor, the Russo-Japanese Peace Conference, the Conservation Convention, and many others. Roosevelt's political fortunes are masterfully offered alongside his personal triumphs and trials. Though not as action packed as the first volume, "Theodore Rex" nevertheless offers a well written and fast paced narrative that is a joy to read.

Probably the most used senerio for alternate history stories is a German victory in World War Two, (the second being a confederate victory in the Civil War.) 'Hitler victorious' gives several thrilling stories based on this theme. While many of the stories are slow and some can't help but seem a little repetitive, some of the stories rank among the great works of alternate fiction. Two of the best stories in the collection, 'Thor vs. Captain America,' and 'Moon of ice,' make reading this anthology worth reading alone. 'Thor' deals with the ancient Norse gods appearing midway through the war and throwing thier lot in with the Nazi's, wreaking havoc with America's war effort. 'Moon of ice' centers around Josef Goebbles' harrowing ordeal at the hands of the S.S. in the newly created S.S. kingdom of Burgandy. Fans of alternate history should get a kick out of this book and there is enough speculative fiction to entertain fans of mainstream science fiction. A lot of fun.

In "Blood & Iron: From Bismarck to Hitler the Von Moltke Family's Impact on German History" Otto Friedrich offers a stirring and insightful portrait into one family's political and military connection to Germany. The book traces three generations of Von Moltkes, from the famed field marshal whose mighty Prussian Army united Germany, to his nephew the general who failed to win the First World War in its opening weeks, to his grand nephew who was arrested and executed as a resister to Adolf Hitler.The book is well-written and contains a strong narrative for all three subjects, with the second von Moltke receiving the fewest pages. Helmuth Carl Bernhard von Moltke is presented in all of his military glory as the founder of the modern German military and the reformer of the General Staff system. Friedrich traces his rise in the Prussian officer corps then illustrates his brilliance as he participated in and directed the three wars of German unification in the 19th century.Helmuth Johannes Ludwig von Moltke is described as "The Nervous Nephew" for his indecision at the outbreak of World War One. His reluctance to take up the mantle held by his uncle as Chief of the General Staff is considered by the author as is the disaster that occurred on the Marne in 1914 after the Kaiser insisted that he did. While one feels profound admiration for the first von Moltke, one feels nothing but pity for his nephew.Helmuth James von Moltke deserves a place alongside Stauffenberg, Scholl, and the other brave resisters to Hitler's tyranny. The evolution of Moltke's opposition to the Nazi regime is chronicled, as is his eventual discovery and arrest. Friedrich offers with sympathy and awe a man driven by conscience and Christian duty to resist Nazism and help plan for a future without Hitler.This book is fine addition to any library on German history and is a delight to read. I highly recommend it.

I must add my voice to those who love Stephen King's "Salem's Lot". King expertly traces the development of evil in a small town shortly after the arrival of a mysterious stranger who turns out to be bloodsucking vampire. The protagonist, returning home after years away, finds himself as a reluctant warrior against the forces of darkness. King's characters are always fun, and here they range from the heroic, to the disinterested, to the seedy, to the pitiful, and finally to the absolute evil. The story feels very much like an old time horror film, but contains plenty of King's take on the day to day wretchedness that accumulates into a lifetime of selfishness, sorrow, and hate- what Hannah Ardent called "the banality of evil." This is a fun book that fans of King's will enjoy and that newcomers to the horror master's work should start with. This makes a strong case for being his best.

Alistair Maclean's novel, 'Where Eagles Dare,' is a great adventure story that takes the reader back to the desperate days of World War Two. The story centers around a crack British commando team infiltrating a Bavarian stronghold to rescue a high-ranking American officer. From start to finish this is riviting fiction. Maclean's protagonists are the kind of characters that make you want to cheer and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing right up to the end. The movie version of this novel, which stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, is one of the the most faithful film interpretations of a book ever made. Read the book and then see the film!

At just over 800 pages of text, Michael Burleigh offers a wonderful and relatively concise one-volume history of Nazi Germany. The police state, the persecution of Jews and other minorities, daily life under the swastika, propaganda, the second world war, and the holocaust are all examined in detail. One facet of this work that is particularly engaging is Burleigh's constant consideration of moral dimensions within the Third Reich. How did one live in the midst of such injustice? How could one turn in fellow Jews? Why did so many fight and die for Hitler? These practical questions and others set this work apart from many others on the subject. I highly recommend this book.

Gordon R. Dickson's 'The Final Encyclopedia' is easily one of the greatest novels of science-fiction. The novels that precede it in the series are also all first rate works. But sadly, the three novels that follow, 'Young Bleys,' 'Other,' and 'The Chantry Guild,' are considerably weaker. While 'The Chantry Guild' does give some reward to the readers who've followed the series for years, it still lacks the final resolution that we've waited for, (no doubt Dickson is planning more books in the series), and the bulk of the work is just plain uninteresting. If you're a fan of the series then you probably should give this one a look, if you're new to the Childe Cycle you might want to start with 'Tactics of Mistake,' of 'Soldier, Ask Not.'

'Nuremberg Diary' is Gustav Gilbert's narrative of the time he spent with the defendants of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial after WWII. As the prison psychiatrist, Gilbert was given access to all the prisoners and the resulting conversations form the basis of this book. From the unrepentant, pompus bravado of Hermann Goering to the disgusting anti-semitism of Julius Streicher to the absent minded Joachim von Ribbentrop to the humbled Albert Speer, this work proves a keen insight into the men who at one time controlled an empire, but who now faced the world's final justice. Thought-provoking, chilling, and at times even moving, Gilbert's 'Nuremberg Diary' will stand forever as an important witness against Nazi barbarism.

Walter Schellenberg is one of those enigmatic figures that emerged from the ruins of the Third Reich. Like the memiors of Hitler's armaments minister, Albert Speer, Schellenberg's account gives us a penetrating look into the inner workings of the Nazi regime. Unlike Speer's account however, Schellenberg sticks to his own field, intelligence, and completly ignores the larger, darker questions of the men he served so faithfully. That aside, 'The Labyrinth' is a remarkable glimpse into the world of German intelligence during World War Two. Schellenberg gives us the same kind of intimate portrait of Heinrich Himmler that Albert Speer gave of Adolf Hitler in 'Inside the Third Reich.' Schellenberg also gives us a memorable look at men like Reinhard Heydrich, Whilhelm Canaris, Heinrich Mueller, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner. But the heart of this work is Schellenberg's own experiences as head of foreign intelligence and counter intelligence. Included are Schellenberg's scheme to kidnap the Duke of Windsor in Portugal in 1940, his 'turning' of Russian POW's to the Nazi cause, and his capture of two British secret service officers on the Dutch-German border in 1939. The narrative ends with Schellenberg's attempts to secure the surrender of the western armies to the allies on behalf of Himmler. For anyone interested in the Nazi intelligence system of the Second World War or of true spy stories in general this is a work that will not disappoint. If you enjoyed this work you might want to check out Gerald Reitlinger's 'SS: Alibi of a nation, 1922-45,' for a larger picture of the German SS.

I consider myself a fan of both the books of Harry Turtledove and the films of Richard Dreyfuss so I was very excited to read their novel, 'The Two Georges.' Unfortunatly, this is not one of Turtledove's better Alternate History stories. The premise presupposes a colonial reconciliation with the Britsh during the American Revolution that allows all of North America to be a British possesion well into the twentith century. The story surrounds the investigation of a stolen painting. The thieves, memebers of the terrorist organization 'Sons of Liberty,' want to spoil the festivites planned for a visit by the King to his North American subjects. While the book does have some interesting ideas- the 'Sons' consider George Washington a traitor for ending the war, technology has progressed at a considerably slowed pace, Abraham Lincoln was the first American Prime Minister of the empire- the story is far too slow and long. There is no clear villain and the plot tends to really bog down at times. Also, there are a few too many leaps of logic that simply wouldn't make sense. If the point of divergence were the American Revolution would a Richard Nixon have been around to sell used cars? Would a Martin Luther King ever have existed to become the North American governor? All in all this is not one of Turtledove's better works which is really a shame with all the potential it has. Nevertheless, if your looking for great alternate history check out Turtledove's 'Guns of the South,' or 'How Few Remain,' or Ward Moore's 'Bring the Jubilee,' all set in the American Civil War.

I am not a fan of fantasy. I've read a little here and there, Tolkien, Turtledove, a few others. Generally its just not my thing, preferring instead historical fiction, sci-fi, and horror. I picked up a copy of George R. R. Martins' "A Game of Thrones" because I heard that HBO might adapt it for a series. Being impressed with HBO series in the past, I thought I'd give the book a shot.I loved it. "Thrones" has all the trademarks of great epic fiction: valiant heroes, diabolical villains, dangers, quests, battles, duplicity, revenge, complexity, adventure, sex, sacrifice, and betrayal. This book reminds me of the best qualities of such outstanding pieces of fiction as Frank Herbert's "Dune", John Jakes' "North & South" and Ken Follett's "Pillars of the Earth". The 'fantasy' element of this work is slight, and the book reads almost more along the lines of historical fiction, as knights and lords battle for control of a kingdom. The fantasy element is there, to be sure, but does not dominate the environment. It is the story, not cheap devices like magic and sorcery, that are the stars of this book.I can't recommend this book enough. It is a wild ride through an intricate and detailed world. You will root for the Starks and damn the Lannisters, (well, most of them anyway)! Most of all you will have a good time.

Michael Dobb's novel, "Never Surrender" is a stirring, fictionalized account of Winston Churchill's rallying of the British nation against the forces of Hitler in May 1940. The novel follows Churchill as he is thrust into the position of Prime Minister even as the BEF and French armies are retreating rapidly in the face of the Wehrmacht.The novel by and large succeeds in retailing this important story, casting Churchill not as a towering giant above petty fears and bickering, but rather as a man plagued by doubt and haunted by the specter of his father. The political machinations of Churchill's enemies make up a sizable portion of this narrative, as does a subplot surrounding a strained father-son relationship amid the background of the war.In all, this is an enjoyable novel and hammers home the instrumental character of Churchill in the opening days of the Second World War. John Lukacs notes in his non-fiction account of the same subject, "Five Days in London", that Churchill may not have won the war in May, 1940, but he alone didn't lose it. "Never Surrender" is a wonderful read about one of the crucial figures of the 20th century.

John W. Dower's insightful work, "War Without Mercy, Race & Power in the Pacific War", offers a unique perspective on World War II in the Pacific theater. Rather than a standard military or political history of the conflict, Dower focuses on the racial hatred that prevailed on both sides, and how this in turn led to a harder, tougher war. Dower illustrates, through political cartoons, letters from soldiers to those back home, and various types of national media just how each side looked down upon the other. For instance, Dower writes that before the war Americans' almost uniformally looked down upon the Japanese as inferiors, but after their successes at Pearl Harbor and against the British, this view was replaced with that of the Japanese superman whose military skill was matched only by his barbarity. This perception was again replaced at the end of the war with the view of the Japanese tamed Monkey, which allowed Americans to adopt a paternalistic attitude to their defeated foes. Conversely, the Japanese portrayed the Americans before the war as being merchants, interested solely in money and trade and unwilling to fight a protracted war in the Pacific. Once the USA entered the war in earnest and began making serious inroads into Japan's conquests, the Japanese portrayed Americans as a barbaric horde intent on murder and rape.Both sides accused the other of barbarity, and there certainly is much to back up the claim for both. The Bataan death march and the Rape of Nanking will forever stand as witnesses against Japanese cruelty. Perhaps just as shocking was the (albeit limited) practice of American service men sending the skulls of Japanese enemies to sweethearts back home for use as paperweights.This racial aspect of the war is important to remember and shares its infamy with the Nazi-Soviet war in Europe. Dower does fail, however, to put this racial war into the larger context of military and political realities of the day. He decries American bombings of Japanese cities as a product of this racial hatred, but fails to appreciate, or at least comment upon, their military necessities. Sudden, dramatic horror quickly delivered was believed during the war, quite correctly, to spare a greater and more protracted horror in the long run. Without Hiroshima and Nagasaki an invasion of the Japanese islands would have been necessary, resulting conservatively in ten times the casualties of the atom bombs. Dower fails to properly put this into perspective.Despite this weakness, this is an important books and sheds light upon this aspect of the war. In a world where racial and religious hatred still abound and continue to threaten war, Dower's message seems very timely.

Brian Keene's follow up to his terrifying zombie novel "The Rising", is good, but not nearly as good as the original. The biggest problem with "City of the Dead" is that by continuing the story of his original protagonists, Keene negated the horrifying ending of the original. One wishes that when writing this book he had merely set it in the same world, but with different characters. That said, this book does succeed on many levels. A corporate CEO with delusions of grandeur fortifies his skyscraper against the zombie hordes even as the leader of the demons gathers his forces for the final assault upon humanity. The book is every bit as dark as its predecessor and offers its share of chills and kills. If you liked the first one you should dig this one as well.

It is almost a cliche to say that a book should be required reading for school-children, but Jack Hawkins memoir of his escape from a Japanese POW camp in World War II absolutely should be. Hawkins was captured on Corregidor Island in the Philippines in early 1942. After surviving in appalling conditions in some of Japan's worst POW camps, Hawkins and a collection of officers, men, and Filipino prisoners made a daring escape that nearly cost them all their lives.By turns humorous and terrifying, Hawkins' book will consistently humble the reader and engender a deep sense of gratitude for what men like Hawkins went through in fighting the totalitarian forces of the Japanese Empire in World War II. If you can find a copy of "Never Say Die" grab it and read. You will be glad you did.

Anthony Read's book "The Devil's Disciples, Hitler's Inner Circle" is a fascinating look at the Nazi leadership. Told in a flowing, easy to read narrative, Read expertly traces the rise of such Nazi stars as Goering, Goebbels, Ribbentrop, Rohm, Speer, Himmler, and others. The portraits he paints are of calculatingly cool politicians who more closely resemble Chicago-style gangsters than leaders of a great nation. At the heart of this work is the bitter rivalry between Hitler's number two man and head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Goering, and his propaganda minister and Berlin gauliter, Josef Goebbels. Goering is presented as a borderline conservative as he seeks to avoid involving Germany in a second European-wide war. By contrast Goebbels is shown as the hard-core Nazi, pressing for ever more radicalization of the regime. The guiding principle in both men's lives, however, was total subservience to their mortal god, Adolf Hitler. Whatever Hitler wanted, these to men strove to give him, even if it was at odds with their desires.Read's book is a wonderful and penetrating look at these men and the cause they served. It offers yet another small piece of the puzzle to the great riddle of the evil of Nazism.

'Pillars of the Earth' is more than proof that Ken Follet deserves his place among the great authors of historical fiction. Set in the bloody English civil war of the 12th century, 'Pillars' spans four decades and the lives of several richly drawn characters. The heart of this novel revolves around the building of a cathedral in a small English village. The sacrifice of these humble people to erect a monument to God is nothing short of inspiring and the tension and drama place this novel among the great thrillers that Follet is known for. Truly a great work and one that will undoubtedly be hailed as a classic in the years to come. This book is wonderful!

Leonard Crane's novel, 'Ninth Day of Creation,' is a smart, exciting dive into the deadly world of biological warefare and international intrigue. Crane's progtagonist, biochemist Richard Kirby, has just created the impossible- a cure for AIDS. But along with the fame his discovery brings danger awaits. Forces operating from Bejing to Mexico City to Washington D.C. are working against each other. The only connection between the three powers is Imtech, the biological corporation Kirby works for. As Kirby is pulled deeper into the schemes of corporate heads and world leaders everyone he has known becomes suspect. Kirby must use all of his cunning and scientic training to unravel this enigma before it's too late. Though at times the story gets a little bogged down in some of its science aspects, the overall plot is fast-paced and doesn't let go. From the disappearance of two bodies buried in the Alaskan wilderness to car chases in the middle of San Diego to the most exciting modern naval battle this side of Tom Clancy's 'Red Storm Rising,' this is a great adventure yarn- and all this leads to an explosive climax that will leave you wanting more. Fans of the techno-thriller will love 'Ninth Day of Creation!'

Peter Padfield's biography of Heinrich Himmler is by turns chilling and fascinating. Himmler's role in the construction of practical racial ideology for the Third Reich illustrates a soul utterly devoid of empathy and compassion. Padfield presents Himmler as a man searching for relevance after his failure to participate in the central event of his generation- World War I. Padfield expertly traces his drift into extreme right-wing politics and his conversion from Christianity to Nazism. Padfield also does a commendable job of showing Himmler's contradictions, as when he is shown practically apologizing to a subordinate for having a Christmas Tree in his home after railing against Christianity in his public life. Overall, this book is a very well written piece on one of Hitler's most ruthless followers.It is not without its flaws, however. For instance, Padfield presents as fact the proposition that it was the Nazis themselves who initiated the Reichstag fire in 1933. Most responsible historians agree that, while the Nazis certainly capitalized on the incident they themselves did not start the fire. Padfield also offers the fantastic idea that Heydrich's dismissal from the Navy was part of a military attempt to infiltrate the Nazi Party. Also, the book ends rather abruptly at Himmler's death. This work could have benefited from some closing commentary or a look at the Reichsfuhrer's enduring legacy of evil.Despite its occasional minor problems this is a book that all students of the Third Reich should read.

Groucho Marx has to be one of the greatest comedians of the twentith century, and sadly, many people of my generation, (I'm 23,) couldn't even tell you who he was. In 'Groucho &amp; Me,' written at the height of his fame as M.C. of 'You Bet Your Life,' Groucho tells his life story with wit, charm and sometimes, real human tenderness. Whether it's the story of he and Harpo arriving at a wedding shower naked, or how Irving Thalberg saved the Marx Brother's careers, this is a wonderful journey through the life and times of Groucho Marx. If you enjoy this book you might want to read the play 'Groucho: A Life In Revue' by Arthur Marx &amp; Robert Fisher.

"Arms of Nemesis" by Steven Saylor, is if anything even a better novel than "Roman Blood". Gordianus is hired by the Roman general and politician Crassus to learn the identity of a murderer among his slaves. Political considerations determine that if the killer is not found Crassus must kill all of his slaves as a matter of Roman justice. What follows is a race to discover the truth and save the lives of dozens of innocent slaves. Saylor throws plenty of red herrings and false leads in Gordianus' way and builds a fantastic dramatic tension in the process. In the distance lies the shadow of Spartacus' epic slave rebellion, driving even the most moderate Romans to fear and violence. A wonderful follow-up to "Roman Blood" and great mystery story in its own right.

When I first picked up Catherine Merridale's book "Ivan's War: Life and Death in the Red Army, 1939-1945", I expected it to be a typical military history on a tactical and operational level. Rather, it is something much more unique and every bit as interesting. "Ivan's War" is essentially a broad social history of the soldiers serving in the Red Army during the Second World War. How these soldiers lived, passed the time, communicated with their families, and died is all wonderfully presented by a gifted historian. Relying as much on interviews as documents, Merridale offers many personal accounts of the tragic time as Hitler's forces smashed into the Soviet Union with a shock millions of times greater than America's Pearl Harbor. The Book deals with many tough topics for its subjects, including the mass rape and looting carried out by Red Army soldiers as the Soviets entered German territory. The work's strength is also a minor downside- there is not really a lot here on tactics or operations during the war. The reader would liked to have had a little more in the way of standard military history to provide context, but this is a small point. In all, this is an informative, haunting work that makes one glad not to have lived it.

It is easy to write off Adolf Hitler as a monster, or a man of pure evil, but these labels only serve to hide what Hitler truly was- A human being. John Toland's facinating biography is must reading for anyone interested in just how one man could be responsible for such horror. From dispelling myths surrounding the death of Hitler's niece, Geli Raubal, and his involvment in the Reichstag fire, to his ghastly orders to carry out the final solution, we see Hitler the man. And while his motives often times seem unthinkable, Toland nevertheless manages to convey the feelings and emotions that led to Hitler's unrelenting policies of destruction. What truly makes this work remarkable is Toland's presentation of the facts seemingly without bias. The facts are presented as they happened and the reader is left free to come to thier own conclusions. For decades people the world over have tried to understand the madness of Nazi Germany. Toland's biography will no doubt educate and help to give a measure of understanding to anyone who reads it. Truly a great work.

Perhaps no single word conjures up such images of oppression and horror as 'Gestapo.' Rupert Butler's penetrating account of this organization tells exactly why that is. In addition to the history and evolution of the Gehime Staats Polizi, this book also covers the methods of terror the Gestapo used in carrying out it's policies of destruction and murder. Also included is a breakdown of the various departments and divisions within the organization. But perhaps most illuminating is the inclusion of several stories by those who came face to face with the dreaded secret police- from a leader in the Polish underground to an unexpected, and almost comical, meeting with Reinhard Heydrich, these stories fill in the gaps of human emotion that most historians often fail to convey. If you are interested in just how the Nazi's were able to silence their political opponents with the terror that came to be their trademark, Butler's book is must reading.

David McCullough's fine history of the Continental Army during opening the moves of the American Revolution, "1776", educates and entertains the reader in the way only McCullough can. McCullough's considerable powers are brought to bear as he examines the crucial year in America's quest for independence. George Washington, Nathaniel Greene, Henry Knox, Charles Lee and other American patriots are shown not as the titans of the age that history has since recorded them, but rather as flawed characters filled with doubt in their abilities to live up to their cause. British leaders also are considered fairly by the author, particularly George III and William Howe. Both are given more credit than typical American historians usually show.Washington's retreat from Long Island and his withdraw across the river is written in a tense tone that reads almost as a novel. Howe's 'Halt' order is considered, making the reader draw comparisons to the British Army over one hundred years later at Dunkirk when Hitler gave a similar disastrous order. Washington's crossing of the Delaware on Christmas Day is also offered as the daring, risky maneuver that it was, with no guarantee of victory.This is a fine companion to McCullough's earlier work, "John Adams", and the two should be considered together. Perhaps the greatest drawback to this work is its relatively short length. Where "John Adams" was over 600 pages and his "Truman" was nearly 1000, the not-quite 300 page "1776" seems a little skimpy. Still, for what is there, this is a great book that should be read by every American.

"Blood of Victory" by Alan Furst is another literary spy novel in the mold of John le Carre. Furst's books emphasize the characters caught up in the madness of World War II and their decisions to fight against the Nazis, rather than caricatures working out the mechanics of blowing up a bridge or assassinating someone. "Blood of Victory" focuses on Serebin, a Russian emigre who left the Soviet Union just before receiving a bullet in the back of the head from Stalin. Landing in Paris and going though the motions of being a writer, Serebin soon finds himself a pawn of British Intelligence and their plot to cut Germany off from its Romanian oil supplies. Furst's Serebin is a man completely disillusioned with the world, but who fights this shadow war simply because there is nothing else for him to do. Furst doesn't hold the reader's hand in this tale, rather he challenges your perceptions of the time period and those who inhabited it. Despite its short length, parts of this story do drag on a little bit longer than necessary, a trademark of most Furst novels. This is a minor fault in an otherwise intelligent and captivating tale.

'Sharpe's Rifles' is the first of Bernard Cornwell's orginal Richard Sharpe series and is a wonderful start. Here we meet for the first time the maverick British officer Richard Sharpe and his tough-as-nails companion Sergeant Harper. The story takes place during the British retreat from Spain in 1809. French victory seems certain. Lieutnant Sharpe is seperated from his unit and forced to command a rag tag company of riflemen, who have little love for thier new leader, though enemy territory back to the British lines. On top of these worries, Spanish partisans insist that the British escort them to a remote village where they believe victory over the French is possible. This is a novel that takes you back in time to the desperate days in the struggle against Napoleon. Even if historical novels aren't your thing the adventure alone is worth the read.

Katharine Burdekin's 1937 novel, 'Swastika Night,' is a rare work of science fiction that explores not only the evils of military totalitarianism, but also closely examines the realationship between the sexes. Over 700 years into the Hitlerian era Europe has become a fuedel society where Hitler is God, Christians are persecuted, and women are reduced to the status of animal breeders. A Nazi leader, the Knight von Hess, gives a disillusioned Englishman the greatest of gifts- a book written centuries before that tells the true story of world history and not the Hitler version that Germany accepts as gospel. It's easy to see the many similarities between 'Swastika Night' and George Orwell's '1984.' Both novels take place in a repressive, totalitarian society where a government leader deigns to help a member of the lower class. Also, the themes of massive nation-states in constant competition and degradaded womanhood make one wonder just how much Orwell 'borrowed' from Burdekin. What makes this novel truly amazing, however, is Burdekin's prediction of the horrors to come. She wrote of the comming war with Germany, predicting both the extermination of the Jews and the prolonged, devastating war in Russia. A wonderful work on many levels, 'Swastika Night' is more than just an entertaining novel, it's an important one.

"Nixon and Mao, The Week that changed the World" takes the reader into the days of the early 1970s when the Cold War threatened the peace of the world and the slightest gestures between the leaders of superpower nations could have profound consequences. Margaret MacMillan presents an engaging view of the flawed genius, Richard Nixon, and his equally brilliant National Security Adviser, Henry Kissenger at the height of their powers. Only someone with Nixon's anti-communist credentials, (the solid conservative Republican, prosecutor of Alger Hiss, Vice President under Eisenhower, Khurshchev's Kitchen Debate opponent,) could have the political clout to stop referring to China as "Red China" and start calling it the "People's Republic" without being cut to pieces by the Left and the Right alike. Kissenger's subtle machination's to see a summit with China are presented in detail, as are his motives to play China off against the USSR. The visit is presented with a novelists eye for tension and drama, as when Nixon's party eagerly awaits word as to whether or not the president will meet with Mao face to face. In all, this is a very compelling read about an important chapter in Cold War history and illustrates the beginnings of America's current relationship with Communist China.

Instead of invading Russia in the summer of 1941 Hitler decides to knock England out of the war with a full-scale invasion in the spring of 1942. Awaiting the German armada is a hastily assembled American Expeditionary Force and the war-weary Brits. The story is told from the point of view of the American commanding general's aide, Col. Royce. Royce tells more than the story of the invasion as he examines the motives, mistakes, loves, fears, and strategy of General Wilson Clay, a flawed but fearless American leader determined that Britain will not fall to the Nazis. As a fan of alternate history I can tell you that this is one of the best the genre has to offer. Stewart's spins on historical fact make this novel all the more compelling. For instance, Clay and his British superiors have the same arguments about meeting the invaders on the beach that Rommel and Hitler had in the real war. Also, the real-life allies' 'Operation: Fortitude' is turned into a German ruse to fool the allied armies as to where the blow will land. The weakness of this book lies in it's dealing with the war in the whole, outside of the battle. The final outcome the alternate World War is only metioned in passing and isn't as satisfying as it could be. That aside, 'S-Day' is a lot of fun. I looked for nearly four years before I found a copy of this book and it was well worth the wait.

While many of the concepts in 'The Parafaith War' are interesting: Quazi-Mormon religious fanatics, brain implants controlling 'modern' warfare, time delayed space travel, reverse racial discrimination, etc... the story is just too long with too many jumps of logic that it will put an end to any possible 'suspension of disbelief.' Besides that, it's just plain slow. Throughout an interstellar war the protagonist shifts through so many jobs that the reader can barely keep up. He's an infantry man, no, he's a pilot, no, he's a secret agent, no, he's a false prophet. While the ending did have a few nice surprises I fear most readers will have put the book down long before then, I almost did. Also, Mormon's and a few other religions might be a little offended at the parellels between their church and 'Parafaith's' antagonists.

Brian Lumley's "Necroscope" and its sequels are equal parts Tom Clancy and Anne Rice. Super-secret ESP agencies are being employed by both sides of the Cold War in an attempt to gain the upper hand. The USSR's chief physic tool is a Romanian who can read the minds of the recently dead by touching, smelling, and even tasting their remains. The British enlist the aid of Harry Keogh, a man who learns all of the secrets of the dead- by entering their realm and speaking to them personally. When a dark vampire threatens to play the Soviet agent in his quest to dominate the Earth, Keogh must use the powers of the deceased to combat him. Thoroughly entertaining and at times genuinely chilling, "Necroscope" is a fun horror novel that doesn't disappoint.

Harry Turtledove's novel, 'American Empire: The Victorious Opposition,' is a real turning point in the expanded series that began with 'How Few Remain.' Jake Featherston, the Confederate Hitler, has come to power in the south and is preparing for his revenge on the USA, and doesn't care who he has to hang from a meathook to get it. Blacks are rounded up and sent to concentration camps along with Featherston's political opponents, holdouts are assassinated, and barbaric party stalwarts are given free reign to spread their message of hate. All of the major characters from the prevoius novels in this series are back, some of them for the last time, and a few new characters take stage as Turtledove's gripping tale of Alternate History continues. Unlike the two proceeding novels, this one is just the right length, not so long that by the end the reader has lost interest. Also, by making Featherston's actions so sweeping, it includes almost all of the characters much more directly. Fans of the series will love this addition, and the tense ending will leave readers howling for more. Another wonderful work of Alternate History by the master.

In 'Spark of Life' Remarque proves once again that he is one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. A combination of literary skill, gripping story, and truly real characters put this novel on par with his most famous work, 'All Quiet on the Western Front.' 'Spark' deals with the final months of World War Two in a German concentration camp. 509, one of the longest held prisoners in the camp, is convinced that despite what the SS tell them the war will soon be over and the camp liberated. 509's fellow inmates, old and young, Jews and politicals, all draw strength from 509 and his will to not just survive, but to somehow stay human in a world where savagery is king. While the prisoners themselves hold to this hope tightly, the SS have their own worries. The camp commamdant's holdings throughout the small town are going up in flames as the British and Americans continually bomb the area and the guards are left with a choice: Run from the camp and risk treason against the Fuhrer, or exterminate all the surviving prisoners in one final orgy of blood. Once again Remarque has created a world so real, so certain, it both moves and educates the reader. All the horror, death, fear, and ultimatly the triumph of the human spirit that existed in these dark times are brought to life by a master story-teller.

The premise of 'The Guns of the South' is simple. In the war's final months the beaten but not defeated Confederate army is presented with weapons that will alter the course of the conflict- a substantial number of AK-47's. General Robert E. Lee uses these new weapons to great affect against the superior northern armies and eventually wins the Civil War. However the bearer of these super weapons, a mysterious group of men with strange accents, clothes, and customs, demand a heavy price. 'The Guns of the South' is one of the greatest alternate history novels that Turtledove has written, if not the best. Although the time travel aspects of this book do tend to stretch the story's believability, Turtledove nevertheless produces an amazingly thought provoking novel of a triumphant Confederacy. Turtledove's interpretation of Robert E. Lee and other historical figures make this novel worth reading alone. This novel along with Turtledove's other work of Civil War alternate history fiction, 'How Few Remain,' should be read not only by fans of science fiction, but by anyone interested in the people, events, and politics that made up this pivotal time in American history.

Jack Higgins brings us a wonderful tale of action set in the inferno that was World War II Europe. After the fall of France, the Third Reich plots to capture the Duke of Windsor in Portugal. Higgins take on historical characters is always entertaing, particular Walter Schellenberg, the S.S. spymaster. 'To Catch A King' is a suspencful thriller that fans of WWII fiction will love, written in Higgins straight forward, easy-to-read style.

Two of the great trademarks of Bernard Cornwell's 'Sharpe' series are immaculate historical reconstruction and action-pakced plots. With 'Redcoat,' Cornwell re-creates an era as only he can, but the story is far to slow and ultimately uninteresting. Two of modern literature's greatest villians, Obidiah Hakeswill and Pierre Ducos from the 'Sharpe' novels, inspire such hatred and loathing that they make the story's protagonist all the more heroic. In 'Redcoat,' however, the reader is one hundred and fifty pages into it before he knows who the antagonist is. The characters are for the most part unsympathetic and the plot really bogs down at times. That being said it should be noted that where this novel does it's author justice is in the vivid recreation of the American Revolution. The battles, generals, and soldiers on both sides of the conflict are treated with respect. The events of this book seem as real as though they happened yesterday. For those new to Bernard Cornwell I would recommend reading his 'Richard Sharpe' series first as 'Redcoat' is, unfortunatley, one of his weaker novels.

Trevor N. Dupuy's work, "A Genius for War: The German Army and General Staff, 1807-1945" is a first rate look at German military theory and practice over roughly a century and a half. Dupuy's central thesis is that Germany's General Staff created a institution of military excellence designed to produce officers with exceptional strategic abilities. Dupuy's research is exhaustive and lends credence to his argument. For instance, the fact that both Erich Ludendorff and Max Hoffman independently came up with the same strategy to counter the Russian attack before Tannenberg is attributed by Dupuy to Germany's General Staff system. This book is filled with keen insight that will delight military historians and casual readers both.

A collection of essays published after the 9/11 attacks, Victor Davis Hanson's brilliant "An Autumn of War, What America Learned from September 11 and the War on Terror" is an intelligent and thoughtful blueprint for prosecuting the the present conflict. Hanson's predictions have mostly come true, such as the need for the US to take on not only the Taliban but also Saddam in the wake of the attacks. He offers important warnings throughout to the American people not to let their disgust and horror with terrorism wane as their own casualties begin to accrue.This book contains many essays that shed light on America, the Islamic world, and the nature of warfare, both classical and modern. Hanson presents humorous counter-factual essays with "What If?" and "The Time Machine" in which America's war against terror is compared with its war against Japan in WWII, where pundits and talking heads debate the 'misunderstood' Japanese and debate the moral repercussions of the Doolittle Raid. In "Pillars of Ignorance" and "The Iron Veil", Hanson takes the Islamic world to task for its denial of liberties, and lack of truly free institutions such as a free press, and he writes of how America needs to adopt almost a Cold War approach to the Mid East as a bloc. "It Really Is Your Father's Europe" looks at our European allies and their foot dragging after 9/11 while offering insights on how to deal with them in the future. In "General Sherman, the Western Way of War, and September 11", Hanson considers Sherman's role in history and how the old warrior would view America's present conflict. A similar riff is offered in "A Voice from the Past", a wonderful 'interview' with Thucydides in which the Greek general and historian gives his take on the War on Terror.These are just some of the many insightful and compelling essays in this collection. Each one pulls no punches and demands that Americans wake up to the frightening realities of the 21st century world. Throughout, however, Hanson remains optimistic of America's ability to prevail against an Islamic world that needs us far more than we need it. This is a wonderful and important book.

Stephen King's novel "Cell" is the horror master's delve into the zombie genre. The chills start only a few pages into this book as a mysterious signal over cell phones turns ordinary people into insane killing machines. Amidst this zombie fueled breakdown of society, the protagonist begins a multi-state trek to be reunited with his family. Along the way he makes friends and enemies even as the zombies begin to show signs of collective intelligence and malevolent intent. There are shades of "The Stand" here, but this story is creepy enough to warrant its own unique place in King's dark pantheon. Fans of horror and zombie novels will enjoy this book, as no doubt will King's legions of devoted fans.

When picking up Kenneth Macksey's "Why the Germans Lose at War: The Myth of German Military Superiority" one might expect some 'magic bullet', given the title, to explain Germany's defeat in two World Wars. The book offers no simple explanation, rather it details a history of bad decision making by German political/military leadership in the early 20th century. Macksey presents a theme that has been offered many times before- Germany's generals in World War I and II typically thought about winning the next battle or campaign, but rarely had the foresight to think in a truly strategic way. This problem of Germany being unable to marry its political will with its military abilities comes perhaps as close as anything to explaining just why the Germans lost the two wars. This doesn't account for the many other, smaller 'frictions' that led to German defeat in 1918 and 1945 of course. As a general overview of German political/military history during the wars, this slim volume is as good as any. But for a deeper explanation into Germany's wartime failures I would advise the reader to check out Trevor N. Dupuy's "A Genius for War", Walter Gorlitz's "A History of the German General Staff" or John Mosier's more recent "Cross of Iron."

Ben Bova's novel 'Mars' is slow, a little too slow at times, but nevertheless is a fun journey to the red planet. The story deals with an international expedition to Mars whose primary mission is to search for signs of life. Along the way rivalries and romance spring up among the crew. While the science-fiction is hard and entertaining, the story more often delves into the realm of soap opera. Bova is an author that no doubt has done extensive research on the subject of space travel but this proves to be both a plus and a minus. Sometimes it feels as though he's forcing situations into the book to show off his research, more often than not to the detrement of the plot. Of course, the plot itself is rather thin. But I do have to say that Bova throws in more than a few twists and turns that will hold your interest and gives us a clever ending. If you're looking for something that's fairly easy to read and you enjoy B-movie characters, this one could be for you.

'SS-Intellingence' is a penetrating look at the Nazi Secret Service. Blandford traces the rise of the Abwehr and SD from their earliest appearence on the German stage to the Reich's final collapse. In addition to providing detailed portraits of Whilhelm Canaris and Reinhard Heydrich, Blanford also gives us wonderful looks at such Nazi adventurers as Heydrich's 'James Bond'- Alred Naujocks, and the cunning Walter Schellenberg. Particularly interesting are the early escapades these men. From Naujocks' mission to assassinate a 'Black Front' broadcaster in Czechoslovakia and his masterminding of the Gleiwitz radio 'incident,' to Schellenberg's kidnapping of two British agents on the Dutch border in 1939, Blandford's book is compelling from start to finish. Anyone interested in German intelligence in the Second World War should check this one out!

Gordon R. Dickson's Childe Cycle, sometimes called the 'Dorsai novels' is truly one of the great works of Science Fiction. The early novels begin an exciting series that continue through Dickson's masterpiece 'The Final Encyclopedia.' The next two novels in the series, 'Young Bleys' and 'Other' fall far short of the series' first novels. 'Other,' in particular lacks much of the kinectic drive the was a prevalent device in the other Dorsai novels. All of the novels take place in a wonderfly drawn universe of many worlds and cultures. What made the first novels of this series work was the amazyingly complex combination of fast-paced adventure and well thought out interworld politics. While 'Other' holds the political intrigues in abundance it sorley lacks the excitment and exhileration of the other novels. 'Other' does have it's good points however; it is full of the multi-dimensional characters that are a Dickson trade mark and has just enough reference to the events of 'The Final Encyclopedia,' (the two novels take place simultaniously,) that it is not a complete waste of time. This is one for die-hard fans only and not a great introduction to the series.

I bought J. L. Bourne's "Day by Day Armageddon" on a whim and frankly wasn't expecting much out of it. Within a few pages I found myself thoroughly engrossed in the story, rooting for the protagonist, and recoiling in chills from the hordes of walking dead. This is a pretty typical end-of-the-world zombie apocalypse book, but the characters and situation feel very fresh here and make for some great entertainment. The style of the narrative, that of daily journal entries, ensures that the protagonist isn't going to die anytime soon, but it still manages to keep the reader on the edge of his seat. For fans of horror or zombie fiction I highly recommend this book.

Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, and Guy Burgess were all firmly part of the British establishment- Maclean and Burgess in the Foreign Office and Philby in the Secret Intelligence Service. All three worked for the ideals upon which the British nation and world democracy were founded- at least that's what they were able to convince not only the world, but their friends and family as well. In fact all three were highly placed Soviet agents who sold out their nation in the name of ideology. 'The Philby Conspiracy' by Bruce Page, David Leitch, and Phillip Knightley is a brilliant look into their careers as respectable pillars of British society and as cunning communist agents. Wonderfully researched, this book looks at Philby's, Maclean's, Burgess's flirtation with communism during their university years and the lengths to which they went to avoid detection. Philby himself served with Franco's fascists during Spain's civil war in an attempt to downplay his own left-wing past. For anyone interested in cold war espionage, or for a better understanding of just what can drive a man to treason, 'The Philby Conspiracy' is must reading.

&quot;Blood, Tears, and Folly&quot; is simply one of the best books on World War II ever published. For those already familiar with the basic dimensions of the war, Deighton's book magnifies key elements which shaped the conflict and defined the times. For instance, Deighton explains how Germany's lack of a strategic bomber force was a major contribution to the Luftwaffe's defeat in the battle of Britain. Deighton also tears down the myths surrounding Erwin Rommel and explains in detail the breakdown of the German offensive in Russia. Rarely has an author made detailed history so easy to read and understand. If your looking for a simple study of the overall war look elsewhere, but if you wish to learn more about key moments, men, weapons and strategies of all the major powers, Deighton's book will amaze and delight.

'The Vampire Armand,' is Anne Rice's account of the four hundred year old bloodsucker who made his first appearence in 'Interview with the Vampire.' 'Armand' begins with the protagonist relaying his story to the newly undead David Talbot. The story Armand tells is that of his abduction from his boyhood home of Kiev, to being sold into slavery in Constantinople, to his eventual education and seduction by the Vampire Marius in Renaissance Venice. The story ends with Armand's account of his part in the events detailed in Rice's earlier work, 'Memnoch the Devil.' While Armand and Marius are undoubtedly two of Rice's greatest creations, the story told here is rather slow and inconsistant. Just when Rice gives you some real food for thought and truly chilling moments she backs away quickly and indulges in beautifully written, though ultimatly unsatisfying, sensual prose. Missing is the rye wit of Rice's greatest protagonist, the Vampire Lestat. That having been said Rice does deliver some wonderful moments that capture the spirit of the 'Vampire Chronicles' brilliantly. Armand's faith is also an amazing spin on the typically jaded Vampire attitude toward life and love. Fans of the series should check it out but those new to the world of Rice's Vampires would do better to start with 'Interview with the Vampire,' or 'The Vampire Lestat.'

Steve Martin is a man who knows comedy. He can perform it, but more importantly, he can write it. In 'Pure Drivel' Martin gives us several short essays that run the gambit from slightly odd to totally bizarre- each one hilarious and each one uniquly Steve Martin. This is definatly for people who think there is more to comedy than burping and falling down. After all, comedy is serious business. While this collection isn't quite as nutty as his previous work, 'Cruel Shoes,' it will still make you laugh out loud and make you just a little bit less sane. A lot of fun for any wild and crazy guy!

Despite his many weaknesses, Harry Turteldove is a great story teller. His books usually offer well thought out, and generally plausible 'what-if' scenarios. More often than not the scope and story of his books make up for his repetition, two-dimensional characters, and hollow dialogue. Sadly, "In the Presence of Mine Enemies" doesn't succeed much on any level."Enemies" was based upon a very good Turtledove short story of the same name, written years earlier. The story centered around a Jewish family in post World War II Berlin- in a timeline where Hitler won the war. That story was a simple tale of a family revealing to its daughter that she and the family are in fact Jewish, that their friends were Jewish, and that she must keep it a secret as all the Jews of the world are presumed to be dead, murdered by the SS. If the secret is revealed, the daughter is told, the SS will come for them.This story makes up the first chapter of this unnecessary novel in which the family and their Jewish friends live day to day with the fear of being found out. Turtledove then uses this alternate Nazi Germany as a parallel for the fall of the Soviet Union as a Gorbachev-type leader comes to power and is overwhelmed by a more dynamic Yeltsin-type figure. The story should have worked, and probably would have had Turtledove been willing to cut out 100-150 pages. As it is the book is just too long and with too many repetitions. It seems that literally every 2 or 3 pages a character goes into a little diatribe about the fear of being discovered as a Jew.Two and half stars seems more appropriate than just two, as Turtledove does manage to create an eerie Nazi-victory world complete with Speer's redesign of Berlin at its heart. But historical twists and goodies like that can't elevate his generally dull and uninspired work. Turtledove can do so much better.

'Fox at the Front' is a wonderful Alternate History novel set in a world where, due to Hitler's assassination in July, 1944, Heinrich Himmler leads Germany and Erwin Rommel is around to lead the Battle of the Buldge. 'Front' begins right where 'Fox at the Rhine' left off. Erwin Rommel, whose panzers had been largely cut off from the bulk of his forces, realizes the neccessity of surrendering to the Americans before the Soviets get ideas about resuming their attack. What follows is a tense, page turning story in which the western allies, with Rommel's help, try to reach Berlin before the forces of Stalin. Overall this is a very believable senario and lends itself to some good 'what if?' questions. The plot is fast paced, sometimes too fast paced, and holds the reader's interest. And while this book succeeds on many levels, the ending seems a little flat and predicatable. Additionally, while many of the characters are wonderfully drawn and add much to the story, others seem to offer nothing of any real interest. Because of this, the book could have benefitted from some trimming. Sometimes it felt as though I was reading nearly six hundred pages for a three hundred page story. Aside from these setbacks, 'Fox at the Front' is definatly worth a look for WW II buffs or fans of Alternate History in general.

"Hitler: Nemesis, 1936-1945" is Ian Kershaw's second volume in his essential Hitler biography. Here, Kershaw traces Hitler's growing power in the international community as he became increasingly bold to the point of recklessness, and eventually ignited the largest war the world has ever seen. Kershaw's concept of "working toward the Fuhrer" explains much of how the Third Reich was run, as wells as the vague command structure which oversaw the mass murder of Europe's Jews. This book is a worthy and important follow up to the first volume of Kershaw's groundbreaking biography.

Stephen Jones' collection of vampire fiction, "The Mammoth Book of Vampires" has a few really fun stories, but on the whole is just okay. Standouts in this collection are F. Paul Wilson's "Midnight Mass", Les Daniels' "Yellow Fog", and Kim Newman's "Andy Warhol's Dracula, Anno Dracula 1978-79". Some others provide their share of chills, but there are some real stinkers here. One particular disappointment was the offering "Vampire" by the son of Richard Matheson, which reads like bad poetry, having nothing at all to do with vampires. This might be just one to check out of the library.

Paul R. Maracin's book, "The Night of the Long Knives: Forty-Eight Hours That Changed the History of the World" runs just over 200 pages. Unfortunately only about forty or so actually deal with the events of June 30- July 2, 1934. Instead, Maracin goes into a relatively deep background of Hitler's cronies leading up to the seizure of power in 1933, briefly describes the Rohm Purge, then spends the last third of the book describing how the various actors met their deaths at the end of the Second World War. I was hoping for a more detailed look at Hitler's strike against the SA, and was disappointed to find that many other books on the rise of Nazism cover this subject much better without it being billed as the focus of the work, (see Anthony Read's "The Devil's Disciples" for instance.)Too often Maracin plays to the sensational and is too ready to accept unfounded conspiracy theories. For instance, though most professional historians accept that van der Lubbe acted alone in starting the Reichstag Fire in 1933, Maracin writes prodigiously about how only Goring and the SA could do it, and states what is blatantly not true, that "the consensus was (and still is) that the Nazis themselves were responsible for the arson and that Lubbe was merely a dupe" (Pg. 101). Maracin's dramatic writing style and forceful declarations really show the author for what he is- an amateur historian. Indeed, Maracin even fails to include something as basic as source notes for his work.This book is not completely without merit, of course, and there is some really good information here, but I would recommend this book only after a deep reading of many other authors on the subject of Nazism as a counterweight. For the general reader this book contains too many mistakes and half-truths to be taken as a serious work of history.

Written decades before Harry Turtledove's Civil War alternate history novels, Ward Moore's 'Bring the Jubilee' is the story of an America divided. In 1863, the Union loss at Gettysburg paved the way for southern independence and left the United States a backward, third world country. The novel's protaganist, Hodge, leaves his rural home for what he hopes will be a better life in New York City and eventually finds himself in a community of scholars where his final destiny awaits him. The characters, situations and philosiphies of 'Jubilee' remind the reader of another great Science Fiction author, Robert Heinlein. Moore has the same wonderful ability to convey the complex ideas of life and society that make Heinlein's novels so compelling. Also wonderful is Moore's explanations of temporal theory and his understanding and presentation of the Battle of Gettysburg. If you enjoy alternate history then 'Bring the Jubilee' will not disappoint.

Like Albert Speer and Walter Schellenberg, Whilhelm Canaris is one of those enigmatic figures who emerged from the Third Reich. Hohne's book, 'Canaris: Hitler's Master Spy,' is a penetrating look at Hitler's head of military intelligence during World War Two. Hohne traces the rise of Canaris from his days as a lieutenant in World War One to his tenure as head of the Ahwehr and finally to his ultimate downfall at the hands of the Gestapo. The narrative does sometimes go off on tangents (notably the chapters on Canaris's role in the murders of communist leaders in the 1920's,) but also provides amazing insights into German foreign intelligence and the military conspiracy against Hitler that culminated in the July 20th 1944 bomb attempt. For anyone interested in World War Two espionage, the inner-workings of Nazi Germany, or deeper matters of conscience, Hohne's book will more than delight.

I recently produced and starred in 'Groucho: A Life in Revue' here in Salt Lake City and allow me to say that it is simply an amazing script, not to mention a dream for any actor to play. The play spans Groucho's life from age 15 to 85 and includes wonderful re-creations of his best comic bits. At the center of this play is Groucho's relationship with Chico. Must reading for any Marx Brother fan and a show so fun and tender that even those unfamiliar with the great comic will be moved.

&quot;Groucho: A Life In Revue&quot; is a fantastic CD that takes the listenter back to the Marx Bros. start in Vaudeville, through thier success of stage and screen, to Groucho's fame on 'You bet your life' and finally to Groucho's final days as the 85 year old 'living legend.' This CD is a wonderful recording of the Broadway show, with the actors giving dead-on performances as Groucho, his brothers, and the people who helped shape his life. Much of the music on the CD were songs that Groucho performed in his films. Numbers such as 'Hooray for Captain Spaulding,' and 'Gallegher and Sheen' reflect the comic music of the time, while later songs, like 'Show Me A Rose' illustrate the tender, human side of the great comedian. In addition to the magnificent music, this CD includes much of the dialogue from the play. You don't have to be a Marx Brothers fan to appreciate the comedy and drama of this wonderful recording. I can't recommend it enough. And if the oppritunity ever presents itself to see the play, by all means go!

If you were a fan of the BBC's 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie,' with it's madcap Monty Python-esque humor, then Laurie's first novel will keep you howling with laughter. Laurie's dry British wit is to be found in abundance in this slightly off center thriller. Thomas Lang, a cynical ex-soldier, is approached by a man who wants to know if he would consider comitting a murder- the man's own. What follows is Lang's frantic, (and hilarious,) search to find out just who can be trusted. From dim-witted hit men to crabby police officers, to world arms dealers, 'Gun Seller' runs the gambit from heart stopping tension to laugh-out-loud humor. As the story progresses the humor does tend to take a backseat which is unfortunate. The plot is good but the book's strength relies on Laurie's irony, sarcasim, and ability to use the English language in print as well as he does in performance. More than worth a look if you're a fan of Laurie or if you enjoy well written comedy.

Michael Reaves and John Pelan's collection of horror fiction, "Shadows over Baker Street" is a wild thrusting of Sherlock Holmes into the grotesque and macabre worlds of H.P. Lovecraft. The concept, as odd as it sounds, generally succeeds and offers many intriguing and chilling stories. One of the better entries in this anthology is the first, Neil Gaiman's "A Study in Emerald", a riff on Conan Doyle's "A Study in Scarlet" which contains a smashing surprise ending. If you are a fan of Lovecraft's odd mix of sci-fi and horror you will enjoy these stories, as will fans of the great detective. As with any anthology however, there are weak spots and some stories that don't quite live up to their potential, but most of the stories here are fun and quick reads. Fans of horror will have a field day.

Gilbert's 'The First World War: A Complete History,' is a chronological history of the bloodiest conflict the world had ever known. Instead of sticking only to analyzation of campaigns and tactics, Gilbert attempts to tell the human story of the war with letters, anecdotes, and poetry, as well as illustrating the global signifigance of the events on the battlefield. Gilbert also tells us how the men who would become the leaders of World War Two spent the war- from lieutenant Erwin Rommel fighting in northern Italy to captain Charles de Galle being held in a German prison to First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill executing the ill-fated Dardenelles expedition. Accounts of Adolf Hitler's exploits during the war are also extremely illuminating. Gilbert also successfully conveys the maddness of era that would allow so many young men to die in the offensives of Verdun and the Somme and allow more than 5,600 men a day to meet thier end in the entire course of the war. World War One has been called the decisive event of the century. For anyone who would like to know exactly why this is true then Gilbert's history is must reading.

Robert O. Paxton's work, "The Anatomy of Fascism" is an engaging and often insightful attempt to create a firm definition of Fascism. Paxton draws a line between mere right-wing, military authoritarian regimes and Fascist ones- the absolute need for war being a defining difference. Many regimes, he contends, may glorify their military, but shrink away from actual fighting. By contrast, a fascist regime feeds on war to fuel its ideology. This is why, despite his better judgment, Mussolini declared war on the Allies in June, 1940. To not do so, Paxton claims, would have seen the toppling of his regime after his repeated calls for war over the years. The dictator was reputed to have said, "War is to men as maternity is to women."The oppression of a minority is also indicative of a fascist regime, according to Paxton, as is the belief that the nation is somehow innately superior to all others. This is reinforced by the idea that their nation, their superior people, have somehow been cheated or wronged, as when Germany was subjected to the Versailles Treaty or when Italy failed to prosper as she was promised by the Allies after World War I.Unlike Communist regimes, which are swept into power in violent revolutions, Fascist states, according to Paxton, must make alliances with traditional conservative forces within their nations. This results in hybrid Fascist/Conservative governments rather than pure Fascists regimes.Overall this is a very good study of Fascism as it existed in 20th century Europe. While Paxton does offer some truly interesting food for thought, one can't help but feeling that the critical essence of Fascism is still undefinable, elusive. Paxton offers a brief theoretical discussion of the forms a new fascism could take, and the reader wishes he had expounded upon this subject. The truth is, as Paxton only touches upon, if Fascism were to rear its ugly head again it would appear in a completely different form from that of Hitler's stormtroopers with banners waving. Rather it would seem more high-minded and more moderate, and could appear from either the right or the left.

"The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916" is a great work of military history that examines one of the most brutal, terror-filled episodes in one of the most brutal, terror-filled wars in human history. Horne's account of this battle is well written and easily accessible without sacrificing the depth and detail necessary for a true understanding of this engagement.By late 1915, with its armies in virtual deadlock with its enemies throughout Europe, Germany decides upon a bold gamble. Conceived by General von Falkyenhayn, the German Army Chief-of-Staff, the attack upon the French fortress city of Verdun was prepared to break the stalemate. The objective of this battle was as chilling as it was desperate: Germany could afford to lose more men than France, hence the attack would not be one to achieve a 'breakthrough' or to capture some vital sector of the line, the battle would be one of attrition, one which was designed to bleed the French Army dry before it bled the German Army dry. Horne chronicles this plan and the opening moves as the German Crown Prince leads his army into the cauldron.Horne expertly relates the many stories of heroism and folly within this battle; from the surprise storming of one French fortress to the hopeless but valiant defense of another; from the reshuffling of German commanders to the creation of a supply system for the besieged town; from the desperate realization by the Germans that the plan is not working to the even more desperate French realization that their line could fall apart at any minute.This is an important book about one of the bloodiest chapters in human history and a necessary component to any World War I education. Highly recommended.

As someone who has studied the Second World War and knew the basics behind the men on trial I still found Persico's account very illuminating. In addition to mearly reporting the facts of the trial, Persico gets inside the defendant's minds and attempts to convey the emotions that these men went through. From the conflicts between Goring and his jailers to the cunning defence strategy of Albert Speer, this is a story that all students of World War II should know.

Edward Cooper's novel, 'Triumph of the Third Reich,' plays out more like an extended timeline with dramatized scenes than a fully cohesive AH story. The basic premise is simple enough: What if Germany developed atomic weapons mid-way through the war and exploded one during the D-Day invasion? After the Allied distaster at Normandy, confusion reigns in Washington, London, and Moscow. The leaders of all three nations are soon replaced by regimes willing to deal with the Nazis rather than face destruction from atomic attack. The writing of this novel is weak, reading almost as though it were a first, uncorrected draft, and the story jumps around far too much to really flesh out any characters or emotions. Rather, Cooper chooses to focus on the events and historical figures, showing the course the war could have taken. That being said this is a very entertaining look at 'What If?' Though some of the conclusions the story supports are a little out there, (like the assumption that Hitler would have waited until D-Day to use his atomic devise), it nevertheless holds interest and is surprisingly readable with many tense moments. If story and character are a must for you maybe this isn't the book for you, but if you love a good Alternate History senerio as much as I do you may just want to check out 'Triumph or the Third Reich.'

Ben Bova's novel, 'Triumph,' is a look at just how the closing days of World War Two could have been different if Stalin had not survived to enslave Eastern Europe. April, 1945: Winston Churchill, fearing the coming cold war with Soviet Russia, gives an order that will change history- the assassination of Josef Stalin. The events that follow from this fantastic decision alter the course of the war slightly, but very definatly. Bova's use of historical characters is first rate. From General George S. Patton seeking a way to beat the Russians to Berlin, to an insane Adolf Hitler hidden in his bunker, to Franklin Roosevelt overseeing the final victory, to a young Yuri Gagarin with dreams of traveling to the stars, this a fun and interesting look at what might have been.

Like Dan van der Vat's biography, "The Good Nazi: The Life and Lies of Albert Speer", Joachim Fest's work, "Speer: The Final Verdict" is a largely unnecessary offering that simply rehashes the old debate about Hitler's armaments minister.Gitta Sereny's superb biography, "Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth" remains the standard work on Speer and will no doubt remain so for a long time to come. Both van der Vat's and Fest's work pale in comparison. The only thing that makes Fest's Speer biography truly compelling, and allows it to trump van der Vat's, was his personal involvement with the subject. Fest and Speer worked together on editing Speer's memoirs in the late '60s. A few personal glimpses of Speer appear in this work, but one wishes Fest had written his own memoir of working with Speer instead.For the comprehensive Speer biography, check out Sereny's work first.

'To Sail Beyond the Sunset' is a tribute to the master who wrote it. 'Sunset' tells the story of Lazarus Long's mother, Maureen Johnson. While the bookends of this story are very definatly science-fiction, most of the novel, with a few exeptions, reads very much like a straight autobiography- and is all the richer for it. Only a talent like Heinlein could create such a character, strong-willed and free-spirited, and tell her story with wit, charm, and no small human emotion. Also amazing is the way in which Heinlein ties in events from another of his great novels, 'Time Enough For Love.' The two stories involve time travel and are told from different perspectives, 'Sunset' from Maureen's and 'Love' from Lazarus'. If you are a fan of Heinlein and his wonderful ability to create characters, worlds, and philosophies, this novel will not fail to entertain. 'To Sail Beyond the Sunset' is simply one of the greatest science-fiction novels ever written.

The Weakness of Robert M. Citino's "The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years' War to the Third Reich" is its limited scope. Citino makes so many good points but never really puts them to the test. Case in point his handling of Barbarossa, in which he expertly lays out the problems faced by the Wehrmacht, bad intelligence, poor logistics, overconfident political leadership, etc... before detailing this one German campaign. The reader would like to see his theories put to the test in other WWII campaigns like Blau and Citadel. In his defense the book is not simply a look at the Wehrmacht in World War II, but a more comprehensive view of the evolution of German war-making. In many regards this book is a success, but one is left feeling a little cheated by the lack of examples.

Victor Davis Hanson offers a magnificent thesis explaining the success of Western Civilization in "Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power". This work presents several major battles between Western and Non-Western armies against the backdrop of Western values and culture. Values like individualism, capitalism, freedom of speech and religion, self-criticism, and democracy played central roles in creating Western culture. It is these values, Hanson explains, that have allowed Western armies to be the most lethal on Earth.A few years ago a friend gave me Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book, "Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies." While I found Diamond's ideas intriguing, I found his central thesis somewhat broad and unconvincing. The arguments made in Hanson's "Carnage and Culture" completely put Diamond in his proper place and offer a much more convincing thesis for Western success. Indeed, in many ways "Carnage and Culture" is a direct rebuttal to Diamond. As Hanson notes, Diamond attempts to explain away Western success as little more than geography, biology, and chance. Diamond is a scientist, not a historian. Hanson states that while Diamond is correct in that race had nothing to do with it, (no one race having a monopoly on intelligence, generalship, etc...), he notes that Diamond completely dismisses culture as reason for Western success.The case studies offered reflect those values that have allowed Western culture to flourish and spread around the globe. The role of freedom is explored at the battle of Salamis, as is capitalism at Lepanto, Individualism at Midway, and dissent at Tet, to name but a few. Throughout Hanson offers an engaging intellectual minefield that blows apart previously held conceptions of culture, warfare, and values. Each study illustrates Hanson's command of the subject, and utterly convinces the reader. I highly recommend this work to those who thought "Guns, Germs, and Steel" was the last word on the subject, as well as for those who simply want to know why Western culture, with all of its pitfalls, and perils, has emerged as the world's driving force in technology, human rights, the arts, and progress in general. This is simply a brilliant work by a master historian.

Harry Turtledove's 'WorldWar' series was one of the great novels of science-fiction alternate history. Sadly, the first novel in the follow-up to that series doesn't quite measure up. Taking place twenty years after the events in 'WorldWar,' 'Colonization' tells the story of a world shaped by the Lizard invasion during the Second World War. The peace made after the war left four super-powers that continued to butt heads into the 1960's- The United States, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the territories held by the alien Lizards. The story is far too long and at times it really bogs down. Also, like many of Turtledove's novels there are too many characters to really find anyone to root for. Most of them are far too one-sided and don't seem to contribute anyting to plot. However, this novel does do it's author justice in many of the ideas expressed and his handling of many historical characters. Himmler is the Fuhrer of the German Reich who still ruthlessly continues the programs of racial purity, Molotov, now the leader of the Soviet Union, must battle with hostile forces within his own government, and in the United States a project with galactic reprecussions is in progress, all this under the unfriedly eyes of the Lizard aggressors. Not one of Turtledove's great novels, 'Colonization: Second Contact,' is a lot of fun for history buffs and has enough wonder for mainstream science-fiction fans.

Akhil Reed Amar's study of the United States Constitution, "America's Constitution: A Biography" makes many good points about this nation's supreme law, but it also stumbles as the author tries to make decided political points while attempting to appear as a disinterested commentator.Amar states that the principle reason that the founding fathers incorporated the Electoral College into the Constitution was to ensure the south a dominating number of electoral votes, (the electoral college distributed votes according to population, which included the 3/5 slave population, and gave the south a greater proportion of voting power than free white voters would otherwise have had.) Amar is correct in his general thesis that the Constitution was at its beginning a pro-southern, pro-slavery document, but to suggest that James Madison somehow pulled the wool over the eyes of northern representatives who wanted the Electoral College to protect the rights of small states is simplistic at best. The electoral college served, and continues to serve, as a republican bulwark against anarchy, pure democracy, and is crucial in the lateral checks and balances system of state and federal rights.Another section in which Amar fails to make an effective case is his awkward dance around the Second Amendment. After much toing and froing, Amar finally states that the right to keep and bear arms is a collective, not an individual right that was created largely for the maintenance of militias and other military units. For this he cites the "fact" that in all circumstances of the time the phrase "to keep and bear arms" was used solely in relation to the military. What Amar ignores is the evidence to the contrary. The first time the phrase "to keep and bear arms" was ever used in an official American document was the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, in which the right to personal self defense through keeping and bearing arms is explicitly stated. Additionally, many letters circulated around the colonies and to the American ambassadors in Europe during the ratification process calling for a Bill of Rights. Many such letters contained the hope for a right to keep and bear arms, and many again cited the need for personal protection as a reason.Amar does make many good points in this book, and I do not wish to discourage others from reading it and coming to their own conclusions. However, I do honestly feel that this book is not as politically unbiased as Amar makes it out to be, and contains some serious flaws of logic besides. Reed it and make up your own mind.

It's hard not to laud too much praise upon Max Brooks for his wonderful delve into Zombie fiction, "World War Z". This book is by turns suspenseful, thoughtful, hyper-kinetic, satirical, profoundly intelligent, and terrifying- but from cover to blood-drenched cover it is always entertaining. Brooks practically reinvents the Zombie genre and offers up Romero's creatures for a new generation of walking dead enthusiasts. Told from the perspective of a UN fact finder years after the apocalyptic Zombie War, Brooks offers multiple stories for the horrific battle between mankind and the dead. From under the sea to the International Space Station, from the plains of North America to the sewers of Paris, from the frozen steppes of Russia to the safe zone of Hawaii, Brooks gives us one hell of a ride. Highly recommended!

David Fraser's biography of Erwin Rommel, 'Knight's Cross,' is subtitled, 'A Life of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.' It should be subtitled, 'A Career of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.' While the great General's skillful campaigns in France, North Africa, and France again are nothing short of brilliant, quite a bit is left out of the overall picture of the man. Rommel's years before World War I and during the Weimar era are barely examined. Instead, author Fraser focuses on the general history of the time, leaving the portrait of Rommel somewhat incomplete. That said, Fraser also gives us a first rate look at the battlefield genius and basic goodness of the man that was Erwin Rommel. Fraser spends much of the work successfully dispelling the myth of Rommel's lack of strategic consideration by showing his constant worry over the battles in Russia and his own precarious situations in Tunisia and Normandy. Also brought to light are the circumstances surrounding Rommel's part in the July 20th bomb plot and his forced suicide. For anyone interested in World War Two or the methods of great leadership in general, Fraser's biography is sure to entertain and enlighten.

Joseph Heywood's novel 'The Berkut,' is a fast-paced thriller set in the aftermath of World War Two. SS Colonel Guther Brumm arrives in besieged Berlin by glider to do the impossible- fake the death of Adolf Hitler and take the Fuhrer from the war torn capital of the Reich to safety. And that's the easy part. Brumm, along with Hitler and a small group of followers, makes his way south through Germany. But close on Brumm's tail is Vasily Petrov, leader of a team of Soviet investigators who will stop at nothing to find Hitler- or face Stalin's wrath. The story that follows is one of action and terror as Brumm plays a deadly game of cat and mouse with Petrov through the bombed-out wastelands of Europe. Author Heywood's research is first rate as he re-creates the end of the Second World War. Though the basic premise is a little far-fetched, Heywood successfully pulls it off with flying colors. The characters are many but mostly well-drawn and the story's anti-hero, Brumm, is a creation that brings to mind another cold blooded adventurer, Frederick Forsyth's 'Jackal.' If World War Two era intrigue is something you enjoy you might want to check this one out.

Sir John Wheeler-Bennett served the British government in Germany during the 1920s and early 1930s and knew many of the key figures in this narrative personally. He barely escaped Hitler's wrath during the 1934 "Night of the Long Knives" when he was targeted for murder by an SS death squad.Yet despite his personal involvement in these events, (or perhaps because of them), Wheeler-Bennett offers an amazing and exhaustively detailed account of the political-military nexus in Germany from the end of World War I until the end of World War II. Originally intended to be only a history of the anti-Nazi resistance within the military, Wheeler-Bennett wisely extended his scope to deal with all facets of the political-military relationship.This is a dense book, and not one for the casual reader or student just beginning his studies on Nazi Germany or the Second World War in Europe. But for those seeking a truly detailed and informative narrative of this topic, Wheeler-Bennett's "The Nemesis of Power, The German Army in Politics, 1918-1945" is sure to prove informative.

'How Few Remain' is the precursor to Turtledove's 'Great War' series and is infinatly more interesting. After the Union fails to subdue the southern revolt in the 'war of secession,' the Confederate States of America attempt to annex key Mexican territory. This has the US more than a little worried as the deal would extend the US/CS border considerably. After the CS refuses to yeild to the US on this issue war ensues. Turtledove's knack for creating alternate histories is amazing, and his treatment of historical figures within those histories is also amazing. A Socialist Lincoln? A beaten Frederick Douglas? Mormons up in arms? While the stories are entertaining the reader must blink his eye at certain aspects of the history, most notably the fact that the Union and the Confederacy enjoy a realtivly even economic status. Also, one of the fundimental tennants of Mormonism is to obey 'the law of the land.' Putting these relatively minor points aside, 'How Few Remain' is a wonderful exploration of 'What if.'

Richard Overy's biography, "Goering" is less a fully fleshed out biography than an examination into certain aspects of Hitler's number two man between 1936 and 1942. Though the book begins with Goering's childhood and WWI service and continues throughout his life, these years are clearly given preference. Goering's role in the German economy is the principle theme of this work, and offers many keen insights. However, his other roles such as head of the Luftwaffe, Air Minister, President of the Reichstag, and others don't receive the same weight as Goering the Economics Czar. This book is must reading for those interested in the state directed economy of the Third Reich, but for those seeking a larger portrait of Goering the man you might want to check out Anthony Read's wonderful "The Devil's Disciples" which details Goering's life brilliantly beside Hitler's other lieutenants.

This collection of H.P. Lovecraft stories is a great anthology and a good introduction to the writings of the horror master. Lovecraft had the great talent and vision to mesh the best elements of science-fiction with the dark worlds of chilling horror. His Cthulhu mythology is legend for its eeriness and macabre tone. The themes of the stories offered here are all unsettling, and some genuinely disturbing, (in a good and entertaining way, of course). Perhaps the best offering is "The Shadow over Innsmouth", which pits a wary traveler in a small New England town against an army of fish monsters. One story which should be read by any fan of Lovecraft (which is unfortunately not offered in this collection), is "Herbert West: Re-Animator" which was the basis for the 1985 film "Re-Animator". Check out this collection and then seek out that story. Lovecraft was an amazing literary talent that left this world before his time.

The first of Richard J. Evans' trilogy of Third Reich histories is an engaging look at German history just prior to and during the rise of the National Socialists. Evans pays particular attention to how various geographic areas of Germany voted during the Weimar Republic and how this led to the eventual Chancellorship of Hitler, despite the fact that the Nazis never won a clear majority of the vote. Evans also includes important portraits of the Nazi leadership, often offering new and unique insights. The final chapters of the book deal with Chancellor Hitler's move against Ernst Rohm and his attainment of absolute power after Hindenburg's death in 1934. I read this book while in Berlin a few years ago and the lesson was hammered home- Liberty was willingly surrendered by the Germans, not taken away. The Nazis didn't 'seize' power, it was handed to them. I highly recommend this book.

The late Iris Chang's book "The Rape of Nanking" is an important history of one of the darkest chapters in World War II. Chang takes a journalist's approach to the subject as she details the events that unfolded in Nanking, China when the Japanese Army overran the city in late 1937 and early 1938. The orgy of blood and violence perpetrated upon the Chinese people by the Imperial Japanese Army equals in brutality the worst excesses of the Nazi regime in Europe. In an ironic historical twist, it was a Nazi minister in the city who spearheaded the efforts among foreign nationals in Nanking to save Chinese lives. Chang's chronicle of this event and its unlikely heroes makes for fascinating reading. Chang also writes of the historical controversy that has surrounded the episode as few Japanese people are willing to acknowledge the event even today. While Germany as a nation has been ever engaged in examining its role in the Holocaust, the Japanese are ever reluctant to discuss the crimes of the Imperial government in WWII. Chang's work has already done much to inform the world of this horrid event and hopefully it will continue to generate a dialogue.

The premise of Crichton's novel 'Timeline' is pretty out there: Twentieth century historians working on the excavation of a medeival castle in France are invited to go back in time to search for their friend by a powerful corporation. I've always been weary of time-travel stories as they can be so easy to screw up. Even one of the best time travel novels ever written, Harry Turteldove's 'Guns of the South,' handles the time travel aspects in a less than stellar way. Nevertheless, Crichton's believability factor soars as he explains in exhaustive detail the method by which quantom mechanics is applied to time travel. Aside from that, the basic story is a little weak. While Crichton's research of fourteenth century France is austounding, it often feels as though he's writing the story to fit his research instead of using the research to support the story. The characters are two-dimensional and not very interesting, with the exception of the company CEO, whose cold blooded attitude makes for great conflict. If you're a fan of Crichton you should enjoy 'Timeline.' Fans of the techno thriller may also enjoy Leonard Crane's 'Ninth Day of Creation,' which is written in a similar style but gives the reader better developed characters and a more interesting plot.

"The Fall of Berlin 1945" by Antony Beevor is an amazing account of the last gasp of the Third Reich at the hands of the Red Army. The advance of Stalin's forces into Germany proper is considered in detail, as is Stalin's playing off of his two greatest generals, Zhukov and Koniev, in their quest to take Berlin. The detailed account of the desperate struggle for the German capital is offered with direct narrative style that transports the reader back in time. Beevor doesn't flinch from the horrors of war and this battle had more than its share. From Zhukov throwing men against the meat-grinder of the German positions on the Seelow Heights, to desperate street fighting between Red Army veterans and German old men and boys, to the mass rapes against German women, this is a gritty, dirty account of World War II's final days in Europe. Highly recommended.

Starz's series "Camelot" is a noble effort to re-imagine the Arthurian legend, but ultimately falls flat because of some serious miscasting, muddled plot lines, and a general uncertainty in just what this series is attempting to accomplish."Camelot" does get a lot right. It's beautifully shot and generally succeeds in presenting the atmosphere of the mythic era. Eva Green's Morgan Le Fay offers just the right mixture of intelligence and wounded pride, and makes a convincing and genuinely fun villain. Joesph Fiennes owns every scene he's in. His Merlin is entirely sympathetic and evokes shades of Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi as he attempts to lead the young Arthur along the path of his destiny.The glaring and unforgivable sin of "Camelot" is in its lead actor, Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur. Bower comes across as whinny, pouting, and thoroughly unconvincing, looking like he'd be more at home in the pulp film "Twilight" than in a period costume drama with a legendary pedigree. His reaction to virtually everything Merlin tells him is a blank, deer-in-the-headlights look. When he attempts to appear regal, it comes off as strutting and unintentionally comical. Tamsin Egerton's Guinevere, though beautiful, is also unconvincing and appears to be just as out of her depth as Bower. Claire Forlani as Queen Igraine really adds nothing to the show, though one suspects she's capable of more.It is not hard to understand why Starz canceled this show after only one season. The many things that work in this show cannot make up for its significant drawbacks. Those interested in the Arthurian legend may get a kick out of it, and there is enough action and nudity if that's your thing. Check it out, but just don't expect too much.

Alexander Hamilton was one of the brilliant men whom we acclaim as a founding father of the USA. Solider and staff officer in the Revolutionary War, co-writer of the Federalist Papers, the first Secretary of the Treasury, and leader of the Federalist Party. But, like all of the founding fathers, Hamilton was a complicated, flawed human being whose national accomplishments were mixed with personal folly and occasional bad judgment.Ron Chernow's magnificent biography, simply titled "Alexander Hamilton", manages to capture the subject in all of his intellectual brilliance and illustrates his invaluable contribution to this great nation. Chernow shows his childhood in the Caribbean and the circumstances that led to his migration to New York to attend King's College. We see his brave and reckless turn during the revolution that first brought him to Washington's attention. The portrait of Hamilton as agitator for the constitution and leader of the Federalist Party is wonderfully detailed. Chernow examines Hamilton's attitudes on race, and clearly shows that Hamilton was a man ahead of his time, not only deploring slavery, but actually believing that the races were equal under God. Hamilton's sex scandal, which rocked his life and threatened his political career is also given its due, once again pointing out that giant that Hamilton was he was also all-too human. His rivalry with Jefferson and his close relationship with Washington are also deeply explored, as is his bitter disappointment when President John Adams refused to go to war with France during his term and thus allow Hamilton the military command he so desperately wanted.Chernow clearly laments Hamilton's early death, the result of a politically-motivated duel with Aaron Burr, and offers clues as to what might have been. When the time is considered that it took Hamilton to author his portion of the Federalist Papers, and with the knowledge that he planned even more political tracts before he was killed, one shares Chernow's frustration that the world was robbed too early of one of its great political geniuses.Written in a clipping, easy to read style, Ron Chernow's biography will inform the reader of this great American and offers a good deal of history of the earliest days of the republic.

Brian Keene's zombie novel "The Rising" is a tense, end of the world scenario which reads like a mix between Stephen King's "The Stand" and George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead". The catch here is that the zombies are not merely mindless corpses, but rather are dead bodies inhabited by demons. These vengeful spirits, arriving on earth after the successful creation of a mini-black hole, are winning a major battle in their war against God as they murder relentlessly, then allow their brethren to inhabit the bodies of their victims. This is a fun and original spin on the zombie novel, and is the perfect backdrop for the story of one man's journey across the Eastern seaboard in search of his son. A great read with a chilling ending. While the sequel was decent, I wish Keene had left the ending of this novel as he had. Nevertheless, if you like a good scare check this one out.

Winston Churchill's 'Memoirs of the Second World War,' is one of the most illuminating works on the subject ever written. Churchill tells the story of the war from the massive rearmament of Germany in the thirties to the final victory over the forces of fascism. As a general history of the war it is understandably one-sided, but as a wartime memoir it succeeds on many levels. The feelings of the British Prime Minister on the strategies, soldiers, enemies, and allies of the war are brought to the foreground with an amazing command of language. Churchill justifies many of the more controversial decsions of the war including his stand on British rearmament before the war, the terror bombing of German cities, the 'unconditional surrender' policy of the allies, and the use of the Atomic bomb. This is a finely crafted work that is a tribute to a man who could make history as well as write it.

Another Clancy novel that proves that the man is a master when it comes to telling a riveting story. This time Jack Ryan is out to stop the Soviets from completing a Star Wars defense system along the lines of the U.S.'s. Along the way he crosses paths with a double-dealing GRU agent, the ambitious head of the KGB and even the President of the Soviet republic. This is also the first novel in which that great Clancy character John Clark appears as well as the second for Marco Ramius and the focus of Clancy's first novel, the 'Red October.' If you're a Tom Clancy fan than this is a novel that won't let you down.

The Premise of Daniel Easterman's Alternate History novel 'K' is wonderfuly eerie. In 1933 Charles Lindbergh, backed by the Ku Klux Klan, becomes the President of the United States instead of Roosevelt. Under his naive leadership, Fascism explodes in America. Lynchings are legal, concentration camps flourish, and by 1940 the possibility of America entering WWII on the side of Nazi Germany is very real. Easterman succeeds brilliantly in creating this nightmare world where neighbors spy on neighbors and anyone who doesn't fit into the Klan's narrow view of the world is expendable. But despite this wonderfully creeepy background, Easterman really fumbles the ball on the story. He loses quite a bit of credibility describing, (or not describing), the way in which characters slip away from the secret police, meet, and escape at various points in the story. Also, the basic plot seems muddled, as though Easterman himself wasn't quite sure where to take his characters to build suspence. The climax is less than exciting, but by this point the reader isn't expecting much. Another reviewer mentioned a glaring historical error at the end of this book. That oversight only serves to again undermine the author's, and thus the story's, credibility even further. Still, if you're a sucker for a decent AH story with some really good historical twists, (J. Edgar Hoover becomes America's Himmler as head of the Federal Bureau of Internal Security), you may very well enjoy this book. It's just too bad such a wonderful premise was wasted on such a lackluster story.

It is truly amazing how much information Richard Overy packs into this slim volume. From the first pages detailing the beginnings of the Red Army in the newly formed Soviet state until the final chapters dealing with the defeat of Nazi Germany, this work is consistently educational and entertaining. Overy offers many wonderful insights in this work, for instance his constant reminders that Hitler and Stalin were essentially military amateurs in charge of the largest armies the world had ever seen. Also his narrative effectively outlines the political/military nexus that existed within the Soviet Union during the war and what this meant to the Soviet leadership, the Soviet soldier, and the citizens of the USSR. This is a well written, relatively short book that is easily accessible for those wanting to learn more about the Soviet Union's "Great Patriotic War."

Albert Speer almost certainly deserved to hang at Nuremberg in 1946. Previous biographies, even those marginally sympathetic to Speer clearly illustrate his guilt and complicity in the Holocaust. Despite his best efforts to shrug of his role in the relocation of Berlin Jews during his remodeling of the city, and despite his tireless campaign to deny being at Himmler's infamous Posen speech in October, 1943, Speer's life has never been truly exculpated in the eyes of history.Dan van der Vat's biography, "The Good Nazi: The Life and Lives of Albert Speer" adds nothing really new to the debate. Van der Vat's desire to condemn Speer once and for all, his desire to show that Speer was good at being a Nazi, simply doesn't live up to the author's bluster, and consequently the work comes across as largely vindictive and weak.Gitta Sereny's work, "Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth", remains the standard biography on the subject, despite van der Vat's claim that Speer's direct involvement somehow tainted her efforts. If you're a Speer completest, then this work is worth reading. New students of Speer should seek out Sereny's work first.

Antony Beevor's "Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943" is simply a wonderful look at one of the most important and horrendous battles of the Second World War. Beevor illustrates the obvious political import of the city to both Hitler and Stalin, but dives lower to present a detailed operational and tactical look how the battle was fought. The sights, smells, and fear of battle permeate this work. One particularly significant section deals with the day to day actions of Wehrmacht doctors within the Stalingrad perimeter and the horrors that they dealt with. I highly recommend this book to students of the Second World War or military history in general.
