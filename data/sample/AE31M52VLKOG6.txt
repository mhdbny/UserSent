Olympic Wanderings is an excellent travel book. David Lundberg describes in such detail the geography, history, food, and people of Greece in just under 200 pages. I truly felt that I was travelling through the islands of Greece while reading this book. I pictured myself drinking some Greek wine called restina on the coast of Cape Sounion and eating some sweet pastries at a paticcera or sweetshop on the island of Cephalonia. I imagined looking at the beautiful Zante style arches of the buildings on the island of Zakynthos.The first part of Olympic Wanderings is about the life and travels of King Ulysses of Ithaca. Lundberg explains how Ulysses was recruited to fight in the war against the Trojans by King Agamemnon and Menelaus. His wife Helen was captured by the Trojan prince Paris. This is the central conflict of the Trojan War, and I think Lundberg explains this very easily in a way I wish my teachers did.Dr Lundberg spends half his time living in North Carolina and half his time living in Greece, because his wife is Greek and her family still lives there. I think Lundberg makes very interesting observations between the modern people of Greece and the ancient King Ulysses from the island of Ithaca.King Ulysses was a persuasive speaker who was equally comfortable sailing a ship as with working on a farm. He was a true renaissance man capable of doing many things. Modern Greek people are a balanced nation of people who can adapt and work in many different environments. Another interesting parallel between Ulysses and modern Greek people is the idea of having a love of their home. Home is not a singular central location with four walls to a Greek person. The idea of home to a Greek person includes the entire environment around them like the mountains and seas. Another parallel between ancient and modern Greek times is the social climate. The city states in Greece today have an inability to unite and live harmoniously. In a similar fashion, the Greeks and the Trojans fought in ancient times long ago. I also learned that most of the Greek islands were once occupied by Turkey and that the country was torn between the Moslems on the East and the Christians on the West. I hope to travel to Greece someday to experience the beauty of the islands and the fun loving intelligent people David Lundberg discusses in Olympic Wanderings. This is a very entertaining and informative book.

100 years of Solitude is a confusing book to read It is enjoyable nonetheless. It is hard to keep track of what each character is doing, because there are so many characters with the same name. Gabriel Garcia Marquez paints a vivid picture of a fictional setting called Macondo where the people speak Spanish. The founder of Macondo is Jose Arcadio Buendia. He is an adventurous person but he gets crazy and impulsive with anything new. These traits seem to pass on to all of his descendants with the same name. The people of Macondo endure a civil war and a widespread plague where no one can sleep. They also have to adjust to living with the white man.I liked about how each character is changed by the events happening around them. Aureliano Buendia is a great example of this. He is a happy, intelligent, compassionate person at the beginning of the novel. However after experiencing defeat in a prolonged civil war, he loses his capacity to appreciate life and his loved ones.Each woman in this novel has her own individual quirk that makes them unique. Ursula is the matriarch of the Buendia family who holds the family together despite being blind. Pilar Ternera is the fortune teller who predicts the future using cards. Rebecca is a reclusive character who eats dirt from the ground when she is depressed. 100 years of Solitude is an ok book but it's just a little hard to follow because of all the many characters.

I really enjoyed reading Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim. David Sedaris writes so well and honestly about the people, experiences, and events that have influenced him, you can't help but love this book. I enjoyed the lighter subjects of this book like where David Sedaris talks about his family dreaming of living in a beach house as a child or about how proud he is of his younger Paul getting married and becoming a father. Sedaris also shares his experiences of helping his parents manage and maintain apartments. I liked how Sedaris and his father worked together to stand up to an unhappy tenant who cut down a tree that he was not supposed to.I loved the part of the book where Sedaris talks about his dysfunctional relationship he has with his sister Tiffany. Everything about his sister's life bothers him from the way she cleans her house, and her inability to find a steady job and also her disgusting eating habits like eating food from the garbage. I think everyone knows somebody who is resistant to change. I could really relate to this essay, and it is one of my favorite ones in this book.There are some very touching and personal essays in this book. Sedaris talks about how he learned to make peace and feel sympathy for a boyhood bully. Sedaris reaches out to everyone in need even as an adult. I loved the essay The Girl Next Door in which talks about his friendship with a neighbor.Sedaris talks about his adventures working as house cleaner and his job as a teenager selling popcorn in a sports arena. These essays are so funny The funny part about working as a cleaner are the weird clients he worked for. The funny part about selling popcorn and sodas is the way he casually asked total strangers for their loose change.David Sedaris is a very funny writer, but he can very serious and honest. I found this book to be very entertaining, and I enjoyed it very much.

The Polar Express is a soundtrack that will definitely get you in the Christmas spirit. Everyone in the family will enjoy something on this CD. I loved listening to the old Christmas songs on these album like Bing Crosby's White Christmas and Santa Claus is coming to town by Frank Sinatra. The song Silver Bells is also on this soundtrack. I think that Silver Bells is one of the best Christmas songs ever written. There is a terrfic new song entitled Believe by Josh Groban on here. This is a very uplifting song. Josh Groban's voice is so smooth and soothing. Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler is even on this CD. His song Rockin on the Top of the World is a bit loud and fast paced, but I liked it anyway. This song will get you moving though.Actor Tom Hanks is accompanied by some talented children on the track Polar Express. This is a very fun song that kids will love. I think kids would also enjoy the song When Christmas Comes To Town. This is a cute song performed by 2 kids with angelic voices. I enjoyed this song very much. Alan Silvestri contributes on this soundtrack by composing several beautiful instrumental pieces. I especially liked the last track Suite from the Polar Express I also enjoyed the track Spirit of the Season also credited to Alan Silvestri which is performed by an awesome choir of singers.The Polar Express soundtrack is the best Christmas album I've heard in a long time. It has a good mix of old and new songs. I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to Christmas music.

The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best novels I've read in a while. I loved the way Carson McCullers develops the characters in this book. Loneliness and racial injustice are two timeless themes in this novel that McCullers presents so well. McCullers was a white woman writing about how black people were mistreated and felt oppressed in 1940. She was an author truly ahead of her time in that way.All the characters are so memorable in this book. Biff Brannon is a compassionate cafe owner. He helps anyone in need by giving them either food, money or a job. Brannon becomes a widower when his wife dies suddenly of a tumor. Mick Kelly is a lonely but intelligent 12 year old girl from a poor family with a passion for music. Doctor Copeland is a black physician. He becomes a crusader for racial justice when his son goes to jail. McCullers explains the basic principles of Karl Marx's economic theory in the novel by putting in a lecture by Copeland in the novel to show how society is divided between the rich and poor people. I knew nothing about Karl Marx's ideas, so I thought this part of the novel was very interesting. Another memorable character is John Singer. He is a man who does not have the ability to speak. However, he becomes the person all the characters eventually confide all their problems to. Singer communicates with his long time room mate and only deaf friend by using sign language. The relationship and love between these two deaf friends is one of the best things about this novel.The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best books Oprah has ever chosen for her book club. The themes of loneliness and racial injustice are timeless and universal. The characters are very memorable too. I loved reading this book.

I enjoyed listening to this CD. It did not play on my computer, so I played it on my CD player and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm amazed with Santana's ability to adapt his guitar playing to the style each song. Carlos is simply the best guitar player who ever lived. The first track is a lively instrumental track entitled Hermes. I felt that I was dancing at a party when I heard it. I don't understand a word of Spanish on the track El Fuego, but I really liked the energetic sound of this track. I'm Feeling Good is another highlight on this CD. Pop singer Michelle Branch sounds great singing vocals here. My Man is a good R and B cut with Mary J. Blige providing awesome vocals. Santana's guitar playing is so good on this track. He really rocks here. Anthony Hamilton has a smooth soulful voice. I loved his vocals on the track Twisted.Steven Tyler lends his talent on the track Just Feel Better. This song is about how a person can become insecure in life about what they want. There is a honesty in Tyler's voice, and Santana accompanies him so well. Trinity is an excellent instrumental track that proves that Santana does not always need vocals to make great music. Santana jams with Kirk Hammett and Robert Randolph on this song, and they sound so moving together.I also liked the song Brown Skin Girl. Bo Bice has such a sexy voice, but Santana's superb guitar playing makes this a great rock love song about an amazing girl. Santana teams up with Los Lonely Boys on the song I Don't Want To Lose Your Love. I really liked Henry Garza's vocals, and I think his guitar playing together with Carlos sounds mindblowing here. Santana continues to make great music. I loved listening to this CD.

East of Eden was originally published in 1952, and the setting for the novel is the late 19th and early 20th century. I still enjoyed reading East of Eden though, because there are timeless themes presented in this book. Sibling rivalry, guilt, and betrayal are some of the main themes in this book. It was ironic and interesting to read how 2 sets of brothers from different generations compete for the approval and love of their father.There are many memorable characters with strong personalities in East of Eden. I loved the complex character of Cathy. She is a whore who shoots her husband and abandons her family. This incident leaves her husband Adam shattered and confused in the beginning of the story. I loved how Adam becomes a stronger person and a better father later in the book. I loved the supporting character named Lee in this novel. He is a loyal servant to the patriarch Adam Trask. He is also the primary caretaker to Adam Trask's sons Caleb and Aron.I loved reading about the development of the characters especially the twins Caleb and Aron. Caleb is the curious, brave, independent, strong willed sibling who has dark thoughts. His brother Aron is the sensitive, studious one. The contrast between their personalities is very interesting. The most intense part of the book is when Caleb learns of the existence of his mother and confronts her.East of Eden becomes a very predictable book about a third of the way in, but it is still a wonderfully written book. I simply loved the evolution of the characters especially Adam. East of Eden has themes of sibling rivalry, guilt, betrayal, loss, and the American dream of getting ahead and raising a family that are still relevant in society today. I enjoyed it very much.

Rohinton Mistry has done it again. Family Matters is a novel about the emotional, physical, and financial strain of caring for someone who has Parkinson's disease. Family Matters is also a portrait of India and the problems that exist there. Nairman Vakeel is a retired English professor who suffers from Parkinson's disease. He is the father of one biological daughter named Roxana, one stepson named Jal, and one step daughter named Coomy. Mistry writes about the physical effects Parkinson's has on the body with such detail. The harsh effects Parkinsons has on a person's speech and physical mobility is well described in this novel. The stress of caring for someone with Parkinsons disease can be great. This is clearly evident when Coomy and Jal thrust the responsibility of caring for their father to Roxana and her family after it becomes unbearable for them.There are many themes in this novel, but perhaps the strongest is religious prejudice. In India, it is important to marry and even associate with people of the same faith to avoid scorn by one's family. Nairman belongs to the Parsi faith and falls in love with a Catholic woman named Lucy. Their relationship is strongly discouraged, but their very public affair continues long after Nairman gets married to a widow of the same faith. Nairman has dreams about Lucy and his wife through the novel that reflect a sense of regret and loss about both women.Mistry describes the declining physical effects that Parkinson's has on a person's speech and mobility. All his characters are so well developed. He puts them in situations that reflect the problems of his country well. With Nairman's medical cost soaring, his son in law Yezad is forced to turn to illegal gambling to make ends meet. Yezad refuses to help his wife Roxana in caring for her father in the beginning of the novel. It is very interesting to see how Yezad's attitude and personality changes after some life altering events. There is another character in the book named Vila who writes and reads letters for people who are unable to write and read for themselves. In one of his letters, he describes how a young man for a lower caste was killed for associating with a woman from a higher caste. Poverty is so prevalent in India that even children take bribes and money from their classmates.There are many different characters in the novel like the violinist Daisy who dreams to be a professional musician. Edul is a interesting character. He is an inept handyman who just yearns to be helpful. Mr Kapur is the owner of a sporting goods store and Yezad's boss. He yearns for the India of old where citizens did not have to live with the threat of violence and riots depicted clearly in the novel.Family Matters is a wonderful book with many themes and characters. I enjoyed it very much.

I love this album from the Beatles. I love the album cover. It is so unique and colorful. Every time I look at the album cover, I count how many people I can recognize on it. It is fun to spot famous people like actor Marlon Brando and psychologist Sigmund Freud on it. Every track is a beloved classic. The title track really pumps me up. "Lucy In The Diamonds"is a song that continues to dare me to dream and set new goals in life. "When I'm Sixty Four" is a catchy funny tune. I never thought that Paul McCartney would be so active and vital in his sixties. "Lovely Rita" is a tribute to the working woman. The piano playing on this track is superb. "With A Little Help From My Friends" is an excellent song about friendship. This song always makes me feel better when I'm feeling sad. "A Day In The Life" is another good song here. This song is a reminder that life goes on no matter what happens around the world. "Fixing A Hole" is a quirky sounding song. I love Paul's vocals and guitar playing on this track. This is the Beatles at their best.

I love Hans Zimmer. His music enhances any movie he works on. I love this soundtrack. The first track Jack Sparrow has a fearless quality. It is one of the many highlights on here. This track symbolizes Johnny Depp's character in the movie so well. My favorite track is Tow Hornpipes. It is a fun upbeat track. I also like the tracks Wheel of Fortune and The Kraken. They sound so exciting and full of adventure. I've Got My Eye on You has a dangerous sounding quality to it. Hello Beastie also has a good dangerous quality. Tia Dalma is another favorite track. It sounds like music that would be heard in the movie when a woman is in trouble. The bonus track He's A Pirate really gets my pulse racing. Overall, I loved this soundtrack, and I can't wait to see the movie.

I loved listening to the music of Barbara Streisand and Barry Gibb growing up, so I had to buy this CD to see if the musical magic they had back then still exists, and it does. My favorite track on this CD is Stranger in A Strange Land. I think this is a great song for all the soldiers fighting in Iraq. I enjoyed watching the videos on the DVD side of the dual disc especially the one for Above The Law. Watching this video you can plainly see that these two legendary performers really enjoy singing together. Barry's high falsetto voice still sounds great after almost 40 years and Barbara's voice is smooth and flawless. Come Together is another highlight duet on this album. This song has a good message for all of us, I think the message is to love the one your with and to stay together through no matter what happens in life.I really liked the piano playing on the song Letting Go. This is a beautiful song about how hard it can be to let go of someone we love to let them live their own life. Barbara's vocals are very moving here. Hideaway is a very pretty song. I really liked the romantic sentiment in Barbara's voice. The saxophone playing on this song gave it a very relaxing quality.Night Of My Life is a track that stands out, because it is very upbeat. This is a nice song to move to. All The Children is a song about enjoying life and celebrating children. Barry Gibb's slick high vocals are what stand out in this song. I don't feel guilty about enjoying this CD, because this music is absolutely beautiful.

Work It Out by Beyonce Knowles and the Boys co ed remix by Britney Spears and Pharrell Williams are the two best songs on this CD. They are excellent dance tracks as are all of the songs on this soundtrack. I loved hearing Shinning Star by Earth Wind and Fire and Angie Stone's groove me. The sampled songs on sound just as good though. The Dr Dre remix of the Rolling Stones classic is pretty good. Susanna Hoffs version of the song Alfie is just beautiful. Hey Goldmember is a nice track that uses sampled disco songs from KC and the Sunshine Band from the 70s. This is a really good soundtrack for anyone who likes to dance.

I love this new CD from Tom Petty. I have been a fan of his music since the early 80's, and his efforts have always entertained me. My favorite track is Saving Grace. This is an excellent bluesy rock and roll song about searching for a place to call home. Tom's vocals are very subtle and smooth on this song. Flirting With Time is a highlight song about how life is short. This song is also about how time flies when you are having fun. Big Weekend is an upbeat track with a sense of adventure. I enjoyed Tom's electric guitar playing on Night Driver. Night Driver is a song about how hard a person works to make a living. Down South is a song about a person returning to the place they grew up. Square One is a very relaxing song about making a new start in life after being down for so long. Damaged By Love is a song about how a young person can get hurt in a romantic relationship. Jack is a song about a person trying to get back the woman he loves. I enjoyed Tom's keyboard playing on this track. The CD ends with a sad but beautiful love song entitled The Golden Rose. This is an entertaining CD from a talented artist.

I love reading books about real events, so I really enjoyed Night. Elie Wiesel was born in Transylvania Hungary. He was a teenager in 1944 when he and his family were taken from their home and sent to a concentration camp in Auschwitz Poland. He spent a year in a concentration camp and where he witnessed people being hanged and burned to death in a furnace daily.Wiesel survived attacks and whippings from the guards. Life was so desperate in the concentration camp that people resorted to eating snow to quench their thirst. A simple thing like the gold crown in Wiesel's mouth were of such great value, because it could be sold for money by a dentist or a guard who wanted it and ultimately got it.Wiesel not only tried to keep himself alive, he also tried to keep his father alive too. Wiesel taught his old father how to march in place to prevent him from being attacked and killed by the guards. There are many words about the Jewish religion in Night. I thought were interesting, even though I am not Jewish. One Jewish reference is the word Kaddish. A Kaddish is a prayer praising God. It is also prayer of thanks for one's life. Another interesting concept is that of Kabbalah. Kabbalah is a branch of the Jewish religion that tries to answer the question of what is the purpose of man's life on earth. Wiesel's srong faith in these Jewish ideas kept him alive and determined to tell his story. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for Night, and his acceptance speech for it is included after the text of the book. In the speech, Wiesel said he wrote Night so that future generations would never forget the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Night is a short book and a fast read, but the experiences are very powerful and vivid. I enjoyed it very much.

The first single &quot;He Wasn't Man Enough&quot; makes me want to dance. I could listen to it over and over. It has a contagious beat to it. The title cut The Heat is also a future dance track hit. Diane Warren has written another great song. &quot;Spanish Guitar&quot; is a sexy romantic ballad that reminds me of &quot;Unbreak my Heart.&quot; The song &quot;Speaking in Tougues&quot; is about the power of non verbal communication between lovers. It is a smooth jam that I find very enjoyable. The song &quot;Just Be a Man About it&quot; is a lesson for the guys about how to break up with someone. This song has honest direct lyrics any person can relate to. This is a good CD that I highly recommend to R and B fans.

I enjoyed watching and listening to the music on this new dualdisc album by Fiona Apple. The title track is a pleasant sounding song about taking life as it comes and making the best of every situation. The bells playing on this song gives it a light carefree quality. I loved the spirit in her voice and piano playing on the song Get Him Back. The video for the song Not About Love is very funny. This song is about admitting that an one night stand with someone is just fun and not love. I also enjoyed watching the video for Parting Gift. This song is about the mixed feelings a person has when they break up with someone. Her piano playing is very moving on this track as it is throughout the album. I loved her laid back sexy vocals on the song Oh Sailor. Her vocals have a nice blues sound on this track I also liked the song A Better Version of Me. This song is about feeling frustrating and complaining about about everything in life and vowing to change I liked the feisty determined attitude in Fiona's vocals in this song. Red Red Red is another gem on this album This is a great song that makes you think about the world around you and about what different colors symbolize in our society like red, blue, and yellow. The song Tymps is a funky sounding song about feeling sick in the head and uncertain about someone you are dating. Windows is a song with bold lyrics about breaking a window to relieve your frustration. Fiona Apple is one of the great young talents in alternative music. She sounds so good on this CD.

I love this CD! Fantasia Barrino gives her fans a glimpse of her talent on these three tracks. Her voice is so sensual and sultry on Summertime. I'll never get tired of listening to this song. Her voice is so uplifting and inspirational on the track I Believe. Fantasia delivers a sassy soulful rendition of Chain of Fools that would make Aretha Franklin proud. I think Fantasia's powerful voice is able to convey so many different emotions and feelings like happiness, sadness, and confidence. She is an incredible talent. I look forward to hearing much more from Fantasia Barrino in the future.

I really enjoyed listening to this new album by Bonnie Raitt. Bonnie did not write any of the songs on this album, but I think they reflect her thoughts and feelings about different aspects of life and relationships. This is the first album she has ever produced by herself. I really like it, because I think that every track sounds unique. My favorite track is the first single entitled I Will Not Be Broken. It is an excellent song about how resilient and tough the human spirit can be. Another highlight is the track Love On One Condition. This is a good song about how people should expect honesty from each other in a relationship. The song was written by Bonnie's band mate Jon Cleary. He gives this song such energy and spirit with his guitar playing. Un necessarily Mercernary is another standout song written by John Cleary. I love the groovy funk feel of the track Dark Water. It is great that Bonnie continues to experiment with new sounds musically which she does on this track.Un necessarily Mercernary is a lyrically insightful song. It is about how a person can see right through someone else, and how they they can detect what their true intentions are. Bonnie sounds sassy and playful on this song. God was in the Water is an interesting song about God is everyone and works in mysterious ways. This song has a nice blues sound. I Don't Want Anything To Change is a beautiful song about how difficult it is to move on with our lives after someone has left us. Bonnie's vocals are very touching on this track. Soul's Alike is Bonnie's Raitt's best work in years.

Tim McGraw is one of the most successful country artists of all time. This CD is proof of that. My favorite track is the duet Like We Never Loved At All. This is a beautiful song about two people can drift apart in a relationship. Over and Over is a track with a very smooth beat. Tim sings nice supporting vocals on this song.I love the new track When The Stars Go Blue. Tim sounds great vocally and hits all the high notes on this song. I love the honesty in Tim McGraw voice on the track Grown Men Don't Cry. There is a tenderness in his voice that is very appealing. I also liked the track Red Rag Top. This is a great story song about being young and making hard decisions in life.The Cowboy in Me is another highlight on this album. I think that Tim describes the personality of some men very accurately on this song. Live Like You Were Dying is another one of my favorite tracks. This song is a reminder that life is precious and that we should live it to the fullest. Real Good Man is just an excellent country song about we should never judge a person by their outward appearance This is an enjoyable track makes me tap my feet every time I hear it.She's My Kind of Rain and Watch the Wind Blow By are two pretty love songs that shows that Tim has a very romantic side to him. My Old Friend and Everywhere are two good songs about different aspects of friendship. This is a very entertaining greatest hits collection. I loved it.

Who would have thought that a singer from the 60's would have the number one album in 2004. Smile is a very enjoyable CD to listen to. Brian Wilson's music is just timeless. His voice always puts me in a good mood. One of the best tracks on the album for me is In Blue Hawaii. Brian Wilson sings about how much he loves the beautiful blue beaches of Hawaii. The Beach Boy classic Good Vibrations is included here. There is a new chorus to this song, but it still sounds great.The sax playing on this track You are My Sunshine is very smooth and sexy. I absolutely loved this song. I Wanna Be Around is a very pretty song with a romantic quality. The track Wind Chimes sounds very dreamy and relaxing. I really liked this song. Child is Father of the Man is a very touching song about how proud Brian Wilson is about being a dad. This is also a song about the things our children can teach us. This song brought a few tears to my eyes. His voice can be serious and solemm as well as light and easy going on this album. Smile is a very pleasant listening experience.

This is the best soundtrack of 2006. All of the cast members shine on different tracks on this CD. I really like the tracks Patience and Family. All the cast members sing together beautifully on these two tracks. I love the title track with Beyonce on lead vocals. It is a fun happy song. Beyonce also performs a very moving song entitled Listen. Jennifer Hudson is a rising talent who shines on several tracks on this CD. She shows off her strong voice on the soulful track And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going. She also sings the upbeat love song Love You I Do. This song is very sweet. Jamie Foxx shows his romantic side on the very pretty song When I First Saw You. Eddie Murphy shows that he can sing too. He is so funny on the track I Meant You No Harm. He also sounds smooth and sexy on the track I Want You Baby. One Night Only is an excellent track to move to. This is the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time.

I remember buying this album in 1987 when I was sixteen. I love this album. My favorite track is "I Can't Stop Loving You". This is a beautiful duet with Siedah Garrett. I also love "Dirty Diana" and "The Way You Make Me Feel". Another part Of Me and The Man In The Mirror and the title tracks are also monster hits off this album. There are some lesser known songs on this album that I love. "Speed Demon" has a great beat to it. "Liberian Girl" is a smooth sexy cut. "Just Good Friends" is an upbeat track. "Leave Me Alone" is a personal song about Michael's yearning for privacy. This is a good tune. This is an excellent album overall.

Sade is back big time with Lovers Rock. She sounds great throughout this CD. By Your Side is a wonderful song about all the things that a person should receive in a relationship like encouragement, support, and tenderness. All About Our Love is another good song about the affrimation of love between 2 people. Lovers Rock is a great song about how the power of music can become a source of strength during tough times. Sade deals with deeper themes on the song Slave Song. It is a powerful song about maintaining a sense of optimism that future generations won't have to endure the suffering slaves have gone through. I love the beat of the drums on this song. Somebody Already Broke Heart is about a yearning from someone wanting to be treated with kindness and tenderness after a painful breakup. You will enjoy this CD.

George Michael is back with an excellent CD. Amazing is a great dance hit about how being in love with someone can turn your life around. This song is really about a celebration of love. Flawless is a good techno dance song about having confidence in yourself. My Mother had a Brother is a sad song about the suicide of George's uncle. This is a very touching personal track. I really liked it.Please Send Me Someone is a pleasant song dedicated to George's lover Anselmo. George wrote this song to tell his fans that he is finally happy with his life. Cars and Trains is another one of my favorite songs. It has thoughtful lyrics about how people can make wrong decisions in life and get caught in bad and often destructive relationships.Patience is the album George Michael fans have been waiting for. The subject matter on this album is more mature and serious. George sounds great too!

Damita Jo is Janet Jackson's best effort in a long time. The best songs are the upbeat dance hit Just A Little While and smooth hit song I Want You. There are so many other great songs that will no doubt get more airplay soon. My Baby is a very good song about being in love. I loved the smooth rap Kanye West has on this track. The song Warmth has sensually erotic lyrics. It may not be a hit on the radio, but it is an enjoyable song to listen to especially if you are in the mood for romance. Slo Love sounds really good too. This song will be a future hit song, because it has a great dance beat. Island Life is another hit song about celebrating the simple pleasures in life like good weather and great music with someone special. I think this song will be a big hit for Janet too. Truly is a good mellow love song I enjoyed. Damita Jo is a great album!

Father's Touch is very moving. I never knew that the legal system in Canada was so fallible. The truth can be distorted and facts can be omitted so egregiously. Justice is not always carried out adequately as a result. Failure to report the sexual abuse of children is a crime in itself no matter who is aware of it. Memories of child abuse will never fade for the victims. There is the natural tendency for the victims of sexual abuse to also repress the pain of sexual abuse which is wrong. The inclination of the victims to become confused about their sexual orientation as young adults is clear in this memoir. Years of therapy and journal writing helped the author to acknowledge and uncover the pain. This eventually put him on the path toward healing. These efforts gave the author the ability to give and receive love from other people. Father's Touch is a courageous and honest reminder that the scars from sexual abuse can heal through time and personal effort.

Rob Thomas is such a talented songwriter and musician. He proves it on this solo debut. I liked the documentary featured on the bonus DVD about the making of the album. Rob gives credit to all the musicians who worked on this album. The DVD also features pictures of Rob writing and composing music. I love to see an artist at work, so I liked these photos.My favorite track is the first single Lonely No More. This song is about how actions speak louder than words when it comes to relationships. and love. I also enjoyed This is How A Breaks. These first two songs have so much energy because of the awesome drum playing by Gerald Heyward. The title track has the universal message that we all search for an sense of identity and purpose in our lives. All That I Am is beautiful song about the sacrifices people are willing to make for the people they love and the things they believe in. I love the steel lap guitar playing by Robert Randolph on this track. He gives this song a spiritual and mystical sound.Another highlight on this album for me. is the track Street Corner Symphony. This song is about accepting people from all cultures and just about celebrating life. The trumpet playing by Gary Grant gives this song a fun playful quality. My My My is a very deep philosophical song about how a person's influence and achievements can live on after they die. This is a song shows the depth Rob Thomas has as a songwriter. Here Comest The Night is a very moving song that showcases Rob's skill on the piano. I really enjoyed listening to this album and watching the DVD.

I love this CD from Christina Aguilera. The first single is entitled Aint No Other Man. This song gets my body moving. I love the horns playing on this song. Makes Me Wanna Pray is another one of my favorite tracks. This song is very uplifting. I love the choir singing in the background. background. Steve Winwood helps out on the organ here, and it sounds very good. Understand and The Right Man are two beautiful song about how a special person can change your attitude about life. Candyman is a fun upbeat track. This song is a definite gem on this disc. Nasty Naughty Boy is a sensual erotic track. I like this song very much. Fuss is a very smooth sounding track. This is a song about a relationship that did not work out. Here To Stay is an excellent song about living life on your own terms and making your own decisions. Still Dirty is a song about everyone has a wild side to their personality. Back in the Day is a nice tribute to all of the great singers of the past like Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong. Thank You is a special song dedicated to all the Christina fans out there. This is a very entertaining CD.

Cry, the Beloved Country is a very moving novel about a black man's country under white man's law. Anyone who is interested in race relations, history, or the African language will enjoy this book like I did. This is an insightful book in which I learned a lot about South Africa. I learned that Johannesburg was the center of the gold mine industry. Many people left their small tribal villages to work there in 1946 which is the year this novel is set in.The basic premise of Cry, The Beloved Country is about a young black man who is accused of and found guilty of murdering a white man. The author does a great job of making the reader care about both the victim and the accused.The author Alan Paton does a great job of describing the character of the victim Arthur Jarvis as a very caring person who was well respected by people of all races. Arthur Jarvis was concerned with the social problems facing South Africa in 1946 like racial crime, the lack of education of African youth, and the conditions of the gold mines, and the welfare of the workers who labored there.Alan Paton does an equally excellent job describing the accused person. Absalom Kumalo is the son of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo who goes in search for his son in the first section of the book. The cause of Absalom's crime according to the author is a breakdown of tribal values and family bonds like working together to achieve a common goal and a sense of belonging to a group. The Western emphasis on focusing on the individual influenced the way of thinking in South Africa that led to this breakdown.I really enjoyed how the fathers of both sons became friends in this book. The white father James Jarvis actually helped Stephen Kumalo The elder Jarvis supplied Stephen Kumalo with milk to nourish the sick children of his village. Jarvis also provided Stephen Kumalo with a person to teach his people how to farm to grow more food.I appreciated the list of words at the end of the book, because some of the African words were hard to pronounce. I love finding out the meaning of new words even if they are in a foreign languages. Cry, the Beloved Country is a beautifully written book about South Africa with strong themes and memorable characters. I loved this book.

Come Away with Me is a great CD. It has something for every music fan. Don't Know Why has a sexy vulnerability to it that I loved. Come Away is a smooth romantic song that I enjoyed very much. You'll love these two songs if you are a fan of jazz or easy listening. Turn Me On and Lonestar are sultry sassy tunes. You will enjoy these songs if you like country or the blues. Norah's rendition of Hank Williams' Cold Cold Heart is really pretty too. Seven Years is a simple but pretty song about the carefree nature of childhood. One Flight Down is a very good song about the effect of music on the human mind. I really like it, because it shows that Norah is a talented piano player and an amazing vocalist at the same time. Painter Song is a dreamy blissful song about wanting to be with someone. Norah Jones' voice is so soothing and enjoyable. This is a great CD.

Heavier Things is a very enjoyable CD. John Mayer has grown as a song writer. I think his lyrics are deeper and more introspective here than on Room For Squares. My favorite song is the hit Bigger Than My Body. I think it is a very optimistic song about aspiring to do something great with your life. I also loved the track New Deep. This song is about enjoying life as it comes and not over analyzing everything that happens to you. Another highlight track is the song Daughters. This is a very sweet song about how parents should cherrish their daughters so that they can become happy adults. Only Heart is an awesome song about how someone you love can make you feel. I liked this track very much. Come Back To Bed is a very sexy song title. This song is about how easily two people in a relationship can get into a fight and feel very lonely. I loved this song and could relate to the lyrics very well. Heavier Things is an excellent album. I highly recommend it.

Devils and Dust is an excellent dualdisc from Bruce Springsteen. The DVD side features Bruce singing five acoustic performances from songs on this album. I liked the fact that I could read the lyrics while listening to the songs.My favorite is the title track. Bruce's voice just touches your emotions on this lovely song about the struggle to survive. The message of this song is that fear can cause you to mistrust yourself and other people. Bruce performs this track on the DVD side of this disc playing the acoustic guitar and harmonica.Bruce's songs are like stories, and I think The Hitter is one of the best. It is a song about the victories and defeats in the life of a boxer who comes home to rest after his fighting days are over. Silver Palomino is another one of my favorite tracks. This song is about how two young brothers come to terms with their mother's death. The Silver Palomino is a great symbol of freedom in this song. Long Time Coming is a moving song about a man who hopes to be a good father to his children. Springsteen picks up the pace on the lively track Long Time Coming. This song is about accepting and loving someone despite their faults. Reno is an interesting song about a man's encounter with a prostitute. I think the message of this song is that sex can be over rated sometimes. Bruce sings the lyrics to this song beautifully. I enjoyed listening to all of the songs on this album and watching the acoustic performances.

Diana Krall is one of my favorite jazz singers. The title track is the best in my opinion, but I love them all. I think the trumpet playing compliments her vocals so well. All of the musicians sound great on this CD. It Could Happen To You is an excellent song about how people fall in love when they least expect to. Exactly Like You and Isn't This A Lovely Day are two very good love songs. Come Dance With Me is another gem on this disc. Krall's vocals are so sensual and frisky here. The track Little Girl Blue and Willow Weep For Me and How Insensitive are standout songs. I love them, because they sound so sad. I think Krall's vocals reflect a sense of loss and loneliness on these three beautiful tracks. You Can Depend On Me is another highlight track. This is a song about what it means to be a friend. I love this new CD.

When Britney came out in 1999 with the album Baby One More Time, she was a breath of fresh air with her catchy dance tunes like Baby One More Time, You Drive Me Crazy, and Sometimes. Her followup CD included hits like Oops I did it again, Lucky and Stronger.Britney has had fewer hit songs since her second album in my opinion. I really like the song Boys from the Austin Powers soundtrack and the autobiographical song I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman.All of Britney's older songs are excellent and they are included on this CD. However, I think some of these songs are too recent to be considered on a greatest hits album like Toxic and her duet with Madonna Me Against the World. My Prerogative is not very good. I had a hard time understanding the words to her newer songs to be honest. I enjoyed listening to about half of the tracks on this CD.

I enjoyed reading about Lance Armstrong's experiences as a cancer survivor and a champion cyclist. I did not know that fighting cancer or the Tour De France was as long and gruelling as he describes in this book. He has the fierce determination to be successful at whatever he does. This is what makes Lance Armstrong's story so interesting.I loved reading about the main people in his life. The influence that these people. have had on him is so interesting. Being raised by a single mother, Lance learned independence and toughness. He learned that life is precious and should never been be granted. This is of course from the compassionate doctors and nurses who treated him during his cancer treatment. The trials and tribulations Lance and his wife Kik go through trying to have a baby are very personal. Lance Armstrong's greatest victory is not winning the Tour De France 3 times. His greatest victory is his journey back to life as the title of the book states. This is a wonderful read.

Harley eventually learns the truth about his father's death from his mother and that is the biggest surprise of all. Harley's sister's Misty and Amber both crave love and attention from him.

Lucinda's voice and guitar playing are so soothing Are You Alright is my favorite of the bunch. This is an excellent song about being concerned about a special friend in need. The track Words is another highlight on this disc. This is a great song about the power of writing. Words can truly comfort a person who is lonely, and I truly believe this. What If is a beautiful song about the dream of peace in the world. I could visualize the vivid images in the song while listening to it. Fancy Funeral is another gem on this album. This is a very solemn song about how money does not matter when someone dies. Learning How To Live is a song about learning how to move on after breaking up with someone. The lyrics in the song are very meaningful to me. Lucinda gets help with some talented musicians on this CD. Come On is a track about feeling frustrated in a relationship. Doug Pettibone gives this song a nice edge playing the electric guitar here. Jim Keltner provides a sexy deep drum beat on the track Wrap My Head Around That. I liked all the tracks on this album very much.

I wasn't even aware that human rights violations existed in Morocco until I read this book. Malika Oufkir was separated from her family and raised in the palace of the king of Morocco at age 5. Malika was separated from her family, because she was seen as an ideal playmate for the king's daughter who was about the same age. She lived a pampered life with servants. However, Malika dreamed of freedom and suffered from profound loneliness. She got so lonely to the point where she tried to committ suicide as a child. She was imprisoned at age 18 with her entire family after her father General Oufkir attempted to kill the king Hassen II in an effort to depose him.Deprivation was a fact of life. They lacked everything from adequate food, books, health care, and even human contact. One sibling suffered from anorexia. Another sibling suffered from epileptic fits. It was Malika who took care of everyone who got sick. The youngest of 7 siblings was deprived of everything being only 3 years old when imprisoned. The family even experienced solitary confinement for long periods of time.I was amazed at how well Malika and her oldest brother Raouf educated their younger siblings early in their incarceration material was taken away She taught her young siblings how to read and write in French, Arabic and English. Brother Raouf helped with math and geography. They entertained themselves by making up stories and putting on shows for one another. They made toys for the little ones of wood and cardboard. They used Tide detergent to wash themselves with.The Oufkir family escaped from jail and such poor conditions in 1987 after 15 years. They were to be imprisoned again in a nice house but still surrounded by guards for more 5 years. I learned from reading this book that true freedom does not always mean a change in surroundings. True freedom happens when people are free to choose how they want to live their lives. This is an excellent read.

I was interested in reading Big Russ and Me, because Tim Russert is one of the most respected journalists and one of the best political minds in the media. I wanted to learn more about this man who has been on television so much the last 2 decades. As the title states, this book is about the relationship and lessons a father teaches his son. Russert not only talks the relationship he has with his father He talks the relationship he has with his own son Luke and the passion of sports they both share.Tim Russert has so much respect and love for his father, and he explains clearly why in this book. Big Russ, or Tim Russert Sr. prepared and inspected parachuttes during World War 2. He later held down later down 2 jobs as a trash collector and a newspaper delivery truck driver and never missed a single day of work in his life. Tim Russert learned from his father the value of hard work and to take pride in whatever he did.Russert talks about the things he loves like baseball, food, cars. Russert is also proud of his strict Catholic upbringing, working in a church as a teenager, and attending Catholic schools throughout his life. He also talks and the other people who inspired him throughout his life like his 7th grade teacher Sister Lucille who made him editor of his school newspaper and gave him a love of writing and reading. Father Sturum was another teacher and influence who taught him discipline and accountability. Tim Russert worked as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's assistant in the mid 70s. Moynihan became his political and intellectual mentor. The late senator taught Russert how to respect true intelligence, ask good questions, and how to disagree agreeably. This is a skill Russert does so well as moderator of Meet the Press every week.Big Russ and Me is a very entertaining and heartwarming book about the lessons we learn from our fathers. It is also about how teachers and coworkers can play such an important part in our lives. I enjoyed it very much.

I love this new CD from Paul McCartney. My favorite track is "Dance Tonight". This song puts me a good mood It really makes me want to dance. I really like Paul's mandolin playing on this track. "Gratitude" is a sweet song about being in love with someone and being grateful for their love. The piano playing on House Of Wax is very good. It gives this track a dark tone. "Ever Present Past" is an upbeat track. This song is about Paul's recollections about being a young struggling musician. "End of The End" is a song about the end of Paul's life. This is a sad and spiritual tune. The message of this song is that death is just a normal part of life, and it should not be feared. "Feet In The Clouds" is a clever play on words. This is a great tune about feeling out of sorts. "See Your Sunshine" is a pretty song. It is a reminder that everyone has individual gifts and talents. "Vintage Clothes" is a neat song about holding on to the past. I like the organ playing and whistling on this track very much. "Nod Your Head" is a song that picks up the pace and really rocks. This is a very entertaining new CD from Paul McCartney.

The music of Whitney Houston will live on forever. Her voice moves me like no singer can. This two disc set contains tracks of songs that I do not have on other discs. These songs are a reminder of her talent. Songs like "One Moment In Time" and "Can I Have This Kiss Forever" are two songs that show Whitney's range as a singer. One Moment in Time is a song that can inspire and uplift. "Can I Have This Kiss Forever" shows her romantic and sensual side. "The Greatest Love Of All" is a song originally done by George Benson, but Whitney really makes this song her own. This song is very self empowering. Whitney's version of this song makes me feel special. "I Wanna Dance With Somebody" is still one of my favorite dance songs from the middle eighties. "I Will Always Love You" is the best song about eternal love I have ever heard. "I'm Every Woman" is a groovy dance cut and my favorite from the Bodyguard soundtrack. "My Love Is Your Love" shows a soulful side of Whitney that I love. All the songs here are excellent.

This is an excellent CD. Stevie Nicks sounds great on every track. I loved the song Planets of The Universe. It has a great beat and very poetic images of nature. I wasn't famillar with Natalie Maines from the Dixie Chicks, but she has a lovely voice. She sounds great here with Stevie on the duet Too Far From Texas. Love Changes is a song about people can grow insecure in a relationship This song also talks about how feelings can change in a relationship. I think everyone can relate to the lyrics in that song. Every Day is a beautiful tune about love is as essential as the air we breathe. Stevie sounds great on the acoustic guitar on the song Sorcerer. This CD will stay in my player for a long time.

This is an excellent CD. It has all of No Doubt's greatest hits on it. I love the song Don't Speak. It is one of the best songs ever about the breakup of a romantic relationship and the pain it causes. No Doubt's version of It's My Life sounds a lot fresher than the original song from the 80's. The song Just A Girl is an excellent punk song and one of their first hits. I love the beat to the songs Hey Baby and Hella Good. They are very fun to dance to.I love it when No Doubt combines elements of reggae to their music especially on the hit tracks Underneath it All and Spiderwebs. Spiderwebs is a great song about how a person can feel paranoid and a little crazy when their privacy is invaded. It is one of my favorite songs by No Doubt. I love the romantic hit song Running. It is a wonderful song about about supporting the person you love.Bathwater is a song about the difficulty of letting go of the person you love. I love the drum beat in the beginning of this song. Gwen Stefani sings with so much passion and energy in her voice. I think that this comes through on every song she sings from the fast paced Excuse Me Mister to the slow mellow pace of Simple Kind of Life. No Doubt is one of the best bands out today. This is a great CD.

Green Day is the best punk rock band out there. They still sound great, but the lyrics to their songs are more meaningful and thought provoking. I'm glad they received the recognition they did at the Grammys this year. This is a very good album. My favorite track is Boulevard of Broken Dreams. It is a beautiful song about we all must find what makes us happy. American Idiot is another hit on this album. This is a song about the negative aspects of living in the information age. The message of this song is that we have become so dependent on media and technology that we could lose the ability to think for ourselves if we are not careful. Another song that really rocks is the track She's a Rebel. This song really pumps me up. Front Billy Joe Armstrong is a great vocalist, but I think that on this track all the other band members in Green Day shine on drums and bass respectively. Jesus Of Suburbia is like a mini punk rock opera. This track has an excellent pulsating drum beat and great guitar rifts. This song is about how easy it is to feel angry, confused and apathetic when you don't feel in control of your life. Extraordinary Girl is yet another hit song about feeling trapped and lonely in a lifestyle that you don't like. This song is definitely one of my favorite tracks too. American Idiot is simply Green Day's finest effort.

Revolver is a treat to listen to. I have this album on tape and in record form, so it is very neat to have it in on a remastered CD form. It sounds clear and crisp not like my scratchy old record and crummy old tape. Revolver contains many hits songs. Every band member shines at least one song with their lead vocals. My favorite is "Yellow Submarine". Ringo's lead vocals on this song are great. This song is a three minute party. It brings people together. This is such a fun song. I also like George's vocals on the song "Taxman". This is a very groovy song. Paul shines on "Eleanor Rigby". I love the violins playing on this song very much. John provides lead vocals on the track "Tomorrow Never Knows". I love the beat of this song very much. I love the horns playing on "Got To Get You In My Life". It is such a happy upbeat song. This is a classic album.

Diana Degarmo is a talented singer. Don't Cry Out Loud is the best track on here. She sings this classic song with a lot of emotion. This song starts off soft and subtle, but she can really hit the high notes showing off the power in her voice. She sounds a little flat on I Believe, but I think she still does a good job in making me believe that nothing is impossible. Dreams is a great song about believing that your dreams can come true. Diana's voice has a nice romantic quality on this track. I enjoyed listening to this CD, but I think Diana Degarmo is still a work in progress.

I love this new CD from Amy Winehouse. My favorite track is "Rehab". This is a very groovy sounding song about someone with a drinking problem who refuses to go to rehab. I love all the instruments on this song especially the trumpet and saxophone. "Just Friends" is another hit on this CD. I love the musical arrangement of this track. It makes me want to dance. "You Know I'm Not Good" is the sexiest song I've ever heard about a person being unfaithful. This track is another one of my favorites. "Back To Black" is another highlight here. This track has a 60's retro sound with the superb piano playing. This song is about a dysfunctional relationship between two people. Amy sounds so soulful on "Love is a Losing Game". I love the slow tempo of this song very much. "Some Unholy War" is another good track. It is about supporting a loved one in a time of crisis. This is a very enjoyable CD to listen to.

The Los Lonely Boys are back, and they sound better than ever.Their style of music is called Tex Mex. It is a combination of mostly rock and blues, but I think their sound appeals to lovers of all different kinds of music even pop and country.My favorite track is Diamonds. This is a great song about how having someone to love in life is often more valuable than material things like diamonds and gold. I love Henry's lead vocals. The guitar playing by brothers Jojo and Henry is simply magical and so good on the entire disc. The track Home really stands out. It is a song with meaningful lyrics about how a home is not just a place but a feeling. I Never Met A Woman is a highlight track with a nice blues rock sound. Oye Manacita is very upbeat song about a very sexy woman. This song really gets up me moving. Roses is a song about a relationship that did not work out. I think that a lot of people can relate to the lyrics in this song. Outlaws is a song with a feisty rock edge to it. I enjoyed this song very much. Living my Life is a highlight track about living life day by day. This song is about going through the good and bad times. I enjoyed this song very much. Memories is a song that is very smooth and relaxing to listen to. I really enjoyed listening to this new CD from the Los Lonely Boys.

This is an excellent acoustic CD of some of Jackson Browne's early hit songs. He is a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who proves once again that he is a talented vocalist and musician. He plays the piano and acoustic guitar so effortlessly and with such feeling on this tracks. His songs have always had so much meaning. My favorite track is The Pretender. This is a great song is about how every person struggles to make a living. at some point in their lives. I also enjoyed the track Lives In the Balance. This song has very thoughtful and relevant lyrics, because we have so many American soldiers fighting in the middle east right now. This song always makes me think about all the soldiers who have sacrificed their lives for their country in war.I loved the track Take It Easy. Jackson's guitar playing is very upbeat on this song. You can hear the applause of the audience on here as he performed this song. It is definitely one of the highlights on this album. There is also a new song entitled The Birds Of St Marks on this CD. Jackson's piano playing is so solemn and beautiful on this song. For A Dancer is another gem on this album. Jackson's vocals and piano playing are very moving on this track. This song is a reminder to keep the passion alive in whatever we enjoy doing in life.These Days is another standout song that Jackson strums so effortlessly on the acoustic guitar. This song is about how everyone tries to learn from their past mistakes. The Barricades Of Heaven is another classic song about being on your own and trying to make your way through life. Fountains of Sorrow is a beautiful song that Jackson performs on the piano. It is a song about when a friend can detect when we are really suffering. I really enjoyed listening to this CD, and I hope a second volume will be out soon.

This is an excellent soundtrack. The music on this CD covers such a wide range of emotions and feelings just like the movie. My favorite song is A Love That Will Never Grow Old. EmmyLou Harris has the voice of an angel, and this is by far one of the prettiest songs I've ever heard about a love that is so strong and constant. He was a Friend Of Mine is a beautiful sad love song about losing someone close to you. Willie Nelson's voice is so moving on this song. I loved the instrumental tracks on this CD especially Snow and Riding Horses. I felt so peaceful listening to these tracks. The Devil's Right Hand is another highlight on this soundtrack. I felt like dancing when I listened to it. King of The Road is another one of my favorites here. I felt so relaxed and carefree when I listened to this song. It's So Easy and An Angel Went Up In Flames are two very great songs that will make you feel good. I loved the lively violin playing on An Angel Went Up in Flames very much. No One's Gonna Love You Like Me is a very romantic song. I think Mary McBride has such a pretty voice and she sings this beautiful song perfectly. Brokeback Mountain is the best soundtrack I've heard in a long time.

The Right Words said at the right time have the ability to change a person's life. The authors of the stories in this book are ordinary citizens. A simple word of thanks from a Burger King employee changed the attitude of a Navy sailor. That simple word of thanks made him proud to serve in the military again. Covering All the Bases is a story that contains the advice that it is important to pay attention to detail in everything we do in life. I liked the cute story of the woman who found love with someone over the Internet. The words that helped her connect with that person was a simple phrase from her childhood. The Chemistry Test is another good story with the message that anything is possible if you try hard enough. The author of this story took a very difficult chemistry test in high school. He learned that he could accomplish any obstacle, because he passed chemistry so many years ago. The story entitled Help is an excellent story submitted by a high school student named Jacqueline Sia. It is about friendship and having compassion for people. Just Getting Started is a beautiful story about a man who taught the people around him to live life to the fullest and never quit on anything. The Boy at Ground Zero is a very sad and touching story about how a man is affected by a little boy who lost his father on September 11th. I loved the story entitled Forty. The message of this story is that age is just a number, and that our accomplishments don't always have to follow a pattern and timetable. Within My Reach is an inspirational story about a man's determination to become a surgeon after losing one of his fingers in a car accident. This book is filled with moving stories and good advice. I enjoyed it very much.

I love the music of James Brown. His music just makes me happy. The slow soulful track It's a Man's Man's World is my favorite. Night Train is my second favorite track. This is a very upbeat track with excellent saxophone playing. I love his signature tunes like I Feel Good and Get Up. I Got The Feelin and Papa's Got A New Bag are two good songs to dance to. Give It Up Turn It Loose and Super Bad are two very groovy songs. James Brown may be gone, but his music will live on forever.

I saw Survivor in concert in Las Vegas on May 5, 2000. and they rocked. Everybody got up and danced when they performed Eye Of the Tiger. Needless to say that Eye of the Tiger is one of my favorites, but there are so many other great songs. I bought this CD after I saw them, and I never get tired of listening to it. &quot;High on You&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot; are such energetic songs you will find yourself singing along when you listen to them. The Search is Over is a lovely ballad that shows the versatility of this 80s rock group. You will love this CD.

Feels like Home is a very good album. Norah Jones sounds great on all these tracks. I liked every song on this CD. Sunrise is a very pretty song about how quickly time flies by. It is a romantic song with simple lyrics. Toes is a great song about how the simple act of toes touching water can make a person feel safe and at ease. These two songs are examples of how Norah sings about the beauty of ordinary things so well.I enjoyed the sassy blues song What Am I to You? It is a good song about being devoted to the person you love, but also about wondering if that person loves you in return. I loved the song Carnival Town. It is very relaxed and soothing. Norah sounds great on the piano on this track too. Humble Me is another favorite song on this album. It is about being alone and down on your luck and asking forgiveness for your miskakes.Creepin in is a lively country duet with Dolly Parton. Their voices blend very well together. I think it's great that Norah continues to explore with different styles of music. The Long Way Home is an excellent song about struggling to keep things together and trying to find a place called home. I wish the words to this song were included here. I loved the smooth silky romantic quality of the song Don't Miss You at All. Norah Jones combines elements of jazz, blues, country, and pop music on this album to create her own unique sound. It is an excellent follow up to her debut Come Away With Me. I loved listening to Feels like Home.

Stevie Wonder is back. My favorite track is How Will I Know. This is a very pretty duet that Stevie sings with his daughter Aisha Morris. She has a beautiful voice and Stevie sounds great on the piano here. I loved the first track If Your Heart Cannot Be Moved. This is a great song about having courage to stand up for what you believe in. This song has very meaningful lyrics and the drum beat really pumps you up. For The Bottom Of My Heart is a sweet love song. I really liked Stevie's harmonica playing on this track. Stevie's vocals sound so sincere and heartfelt here. Please Don't Hurt My Baby is a funky soulful track about someone who is unfaithful in a relationship. This is an upbeat track and one of my favorites. True Love is a very romantic sounding track. The saxophone playing on this track gives it a sexy smooth quality. So What The Fuss is another highlight on this album. It is a very groovy sounding track that features Prince playing the guitar. This song is like a collection of Stevie's perceptions of the careless and harmful things people do to themselves. Shelter in The Rain is another one of my favorite songs. This song is about being there for a friend when they need you the most. Stevie's vocals are very touching on this song. Postivity is a standout upbeat track about having a postive attitude about life and simply being thankful to be alive. This is another song that features his daughter Aisha. The title track is an excellent duet with India Arie. This track is about a call for peace in the world. Stevie communicates so much wisdom and insight about the world today. This song lasts over nine minutes, but I really enjoyed it, because I could hear all the instruments playing especially the African drums. Stevie is back and he sounds great. I think that A Time To Love is one of Stevie Wonder's best albums.

I enjoyed reading this book very much. Having rules and constraints in society is a good thing and should be embraced. This is an important idea of this book. The Paradox of Choice explains how people arrive at the decisions they do. This book also talks about the negative aspects of making decisions in a world with so many choices. Finally, this book offers suggestions on how to make better choices and reduce stress.Barry Schwartz makes many good points about decision making. One of them is that because of the growing number of choices we are presented with, we don't always have the time to look at all the information out there to make the best choice. Another interesting point is that people expect certain decisions to be made for them. In the health care field for example, we expect the doctor to tell what kind of treatment we need.I learned from reading this book that we should all strive to be satisficers rather maximizers. A satisficer is a person who chooses a product or service that is good enough. A maximizer is a person who is always trying to get the best product. A satisficer is usually happy with their choice. In contrast, a maximizer isn't happy and often regrets what they bought.We should also try to stick our choices and not change our minds. This is another way to reduce anixety I learned in the book. This is very hard to do consistently, but I thought this was a good piece of advice. I also enjoyed the idea of being a chooser and not a picker. Choosers have time to change their goals whereas pickers do not. Choosers take their time making a decision considering all their options unlike pickers who do not.The Paradox of Choice is an excellent book with a lot of interesting information about the habits people have in making decisions. It also has very useful tips on how to reduce anixety in your life.

I enjoyed reading this book, because I learned about a subject I knew nothing about before. This is a wonderful coming of age novel set in rural Kentucky in the 1950's. The main character is an orphan named Icy Sparks. She suffers from Tourette's syndrome which causes her body to jerk involuntarily. Tourettes also causes Icy to repeat curse words uncontrollably. This condition leads to much embarassment at school in her early years. She is teased and shunned by her classmates. Icy spends some time in a mental hospital upon the suggestion of her school principal and grandparents. She makes friends with other disabled people there. She also learns new ways to deal with her disorder during her stay. Miss Emily is a compassionate fat woman. She is Icy's best friend throughout the book. I loved the relationship between these two characters. She teaches Icy her academic subjects and about life too. I loved the ending of the book. It is so touching when Icy finally finds her gift. I highly recommend Icy Sparks.

I am waiting like the rest of America for Clay Aiken to release a CD of all original songs. This CD from the young man from North Carolina is pretty good though. The best track in my opinion is A Thousand Days. This is an original song. I really like Clay's strong clear voice here. Everything I Have is another gem. Clay's rendition of Without You is very touching and romantic. He hits the high notes so well. Sorry Is The Hardest Word is a classic song. Clay creates an appropriate sad tone with his voice on this song. The guitar playing is beautiful here too. Clay's rendition of Right Here Waiting and I Wanna Know What Love Is and Every Time You Go Away are three songs I grew up listening to the 80s. Clay obviously loves these classic songs too. I think he sings them well as a tribute to the original artists. I enjoyed listening to this CD very much.

I love a good love story, and Love In The Time of Cholera is an excellent one. I didn't know there was a civil war in the Caribbean during the late nineteen and early twentieth century. I also didn't know that cholera killed so many people during that time. Feelings of love and affection for another person can last forever. Any one can be lonely. Wealth influences personal decisions in this book These are three themes I found when reading this novel. Every character in this book is memorable. I identify with the romantic and patient character of Florentino the most. I love the character of Fermina too. She is loyal but very lonely. Aging and mortality is an important theme in the novel. Every character in this novel has a sense of their own mortality. The setting of the novel is so descriptive. The characters are memorable and the themes are strongly presented. I really enjoyed this book.

There is a lot of deep information in this book that needs to digested and understood. Eckhart Tolle does not belong to any organized religion. His beliefs are common sense. Many people will find value in this book as a result. The idea of living in the now and finding peace in the present moment is not a revolutionary concept. However, it is a very important thing to remember, because the present is the only reality a person can control. It is also important to remember not to be resistant, judgmental or attached to material things, but this is very difficult for everyone to do. Having an awareness of how our personal actions affect others and an awareness of the environment are two main themes in the book.The chapter on pain bodies is very interesting. I truly believe that people carry negative emotional baggage that affects them throughout life. Tolle's discussion of the ego is thought provoking too. I never thought an individual's ego could be the source of so many bad things like greed, violence, and jealousy, but there is a lot of truth to the power of the ego.I found a lot of personal value in this book. I think the most important lesson I learned is to embrace uncertainity in life, because it can leave the door open to many possibilities. I think another important lesson is to just focus on the task at hand and not be so worried about time. The New World is a guide for anyone who feels hurried or stressed out in life. The New World is an excellent read.

Dreams From My Father is a wonderful memoir about the life of Senator elect Barack Obama from Illinois. The experiences in this book are very descriptive and vivid. This book has three parts to it. The first part is entitled Origins. In this section, he talks about being raised in Hawaii by his white mother and grandparents. I recognized and enjoyed reading about all of the beautiful locales he describes while in living in Hawaii. He also writes about his education at a prestigious prep school in Honolulu, and that he felt like a minority there being half black and half white. The first section of the book also talks about the he spent in Indonesia as a child and being briefly raised as a muslim by his step father. He ate snakes as a child and saw beggars daily while living there.The second section of this book is about Barack Obama's life in Chicago and his work as a neighborhood organizer. This section is the book really describes how he develops a passion for public service. My favorite part of this section is how he tries to improve the education system and living conditions of low income residents in a neighborhood called Altgeld in Chicago.The third section of this book is about how Obama travels to Kenya to learn about the father he never knew and meet his long lost family and his biological father he barely knew. I really liked his description of the land in Kenya and his experience of going on an African safari.This memoir also includes the keynote address Obama delivered at the Democratic National Convention. This is a very moving speech. Barack Obama has lived a very interesting life. I think he is an eloquent writer as well as a great public speaker. I loved reading this book.

This is a very enjoyable CD. Eric Clapton and JJ Cale compliment each other so well vocally and on the guitar. They harmonize so well on the track Danger. Eric's guitar playing is so slick throughout the entire disc. Sporting Life Blues is another highlight on this disc. It has a classic slow tempo blues sound. Dead End Road is a fun upbeat song that really gets me moving. I love the energetic piano and fiddle playing on this song very much. It's Easy is a track about the art of living the simple life. I love the lyrics to this song. Heads in Georgia has a slow sensual sounding quality to it. It is interesting song about how a person's mind and body can be in two separate places. Missing Person is a light fun sounding track about a woman who disappears without saying a word. This song is one of my favorites. Three Little Girls is a sweet song. I love the harmonica playing on this track. Don't Cry Sister is another standout track in which Clapton and Cale harmonize so well together. The Road to Escondido is one of the best musical collaborations of 2006.

The soundtrack In Good Company and the movie are very good. I really liked the song Glass, Concrete, and Stone by David Byrne. This is a song about the routine of daily life. It is also about how hard everybody works to earn a living. The track Besame Mucho by Diana Krall is another highlight for me. Her rendition of this classic song is very soothing and sensual. Naked as We Came by Iron and Wine is a very pretty song about we all feel insecure at some point in our lives.Peter Gabriel's hit song Solsbury Hill is included on this soundtrack. I think this song is very uplifting and optimistic. I haven't heard it in years, and I really enjoyed it. Steely Dan's classic Reeling in the Years is just a feel good song. Composer Stephen Trask contributes three wonderful instrumental tracks that enhance the movie well I'm Psyched is a beautiful lively instrumental piece about working together to get the job done. This is one of my favorite tracks on this soundtrack. In Good Company is an excellent soundtrack. I highly recommend it.

The title Peachtree Road is a reference to a stretch of road in Elton John's adopted hometown of Atlanta Georgia. I think that a lot of these songs are very reflective, because they are based from Elton John's personal experiences. I cannot say enough about the song writing ability of Elton John's partner Bernie Taupin. He is a very talented man His lyrics are still meaningful after all these years Davey Johnstone returns and plays awesome acoustic and electric guitar on most of these songs. I think he accompanies Elton John rich full bodied voice well.I enjoyed Peachtree Road more I listened to it. My favorite song is still the first single Answer in The Sky. This is an excellent song about how people have the ability to solve their own problems if they believe and work hard enough.Weight of the World is another track on this album that stands out. This song is about living a happy life and not feeling the pressure to please everyone. This track sounds like how Elton John feels at this stage in his career. My Elusive Drug is another great autobiographical song about how Elton John has successfully battled his addiction to alcohol and drugs to stay clean and find happiness.No More Tears is another good track on this CD. This song makes references to famous people like Martin Luther King Jr and the astronauts who landed on the moon in 1969. I think the message of this song is that we should be thankful for their achievements to society. EJ sounds great on the song Freaks In Love. He really understands what it feels like to be an outsider different from everyone else. I think he embraces all the outsiders of the world on this song.Elton John just keeps making hit songs. I really enjoyed listening to Peachtree Road. This album is a must for all Elton John fans.

I love the voice of Aaron Neville. I also love all the performances of the musicians on this CD. My favorite track is Rainy Night In Georgia. Chris Botti gives this track a smooth sensual quality with his trumpet playing. He compliments Aaron's vocals well. Respect Yourself is a fun upbeat duet with Mavis Staples. Lets Stay Together is another highlight duet with Chaka Khan. They harmonize beautifully together. Sittin on The Dock Of The Bay is a groovy sounding track especially with Ray Parker Jr. on the electric guitar. I love the tone of Aaron's voice on the track You Send Me. It sounds very pretty and romantic. It's All Right and People Get Ready are really uplifting tracks. Aint that Pecuilar sounds so soulful and energetic. I love Aaron's rendition of this song. Stand By Me is one of my all time favorite tunes. It is a great song about friendship. Joe Sample's piano playing is so good on this track. Bring It On Home is an excellent CD of classic soul songs.

This is an excellent CD for people who like jazz and easy listening music. Renee Oldstead's voice is so soothing and pleasant My favorite track is A Love that Will Last. It is a very romantic and optimistic song. I love her cover of the song Midnight at The Oasis so much. Her voice is so silky smooth that I forgot who sang the original. Renee has such great chemistry especially on her duet Breaking Up is Hard To Do with Chris Cinotti. They sound as though they are singing this song about each other. The piano playing on this track is so good too. Renee sounds so sexy and tempting on the song Meet Me Midnight. I really enjoyed this song. The trumpet playing on this song accompanies her voice well. I was blown away with Renee's performance of Summertime on this album. She sings this tune appropriately and so well with a slow, subtle, sultry quality. It is hard to believe that she is just a teenager. Her vocal performance on the song Sentimental Journey is so good. It makes me want to find my true love. Renee Oldstead is a wonderful new singer with so much talent. I loved this listening to this album.

I love the music of Mary J. Blige. My favorite track on this album is Take Me As I Am. This is an excellent song about self acceptance and loving yourself. This is a very inspirational song for anyone who is struggling in life. No One Will Do is a standout track. This is a song about the love Mary has for her husband. Another highlight on this CD is MJB Da MVP. This song is about the ups and downs of Mary's life and career in the music business. It is a great dance track. Be Without You is another gem on this album. This is a heart wrenching hit song about missing a loved one. One is a very strong track too. Bono and Mary sound great singing together. Mary gives this classic U2 song a special touch with her soulful voice. The songs on this CD are very personal. The Breakthrough is the best album in the career of Mary J. Blige.

I am a big fan of Linda Ronstadt's voice. Ann Savoy has a lovely voice too. I think they make beautiful music together. My favorite track on this CD is the song Walk Away Renee. All of the musicians sound great on this song and throughout the entire CD. Byron House is very good on the upright bass. I also liked the violin playing by Stuart Duncan. I also liked the acoustic guitar playing by Joel Savoy on this track too. The title track is an excellent song about leaving someone you don't love. I Can't Over You is a song about how difficult it can be to leave someone. I loved the love song Parlez Moi Damour. Plus Tu Tournes is an upbeat French song. I liked this tune very much. Too Old To Die Young is another one of my favorite tracks. This is a beautiful song is about a person thinking about their own mortality and hoping to live a long life. Rattle My Cage is a song about a person searching for a sense of purpose in life. This song is also about a person reaching out for help. King of Bohemia is another standout song here. This song reminds us that life goes on despite all the set backs a person encounters. I enjoyed the music on this CD very much.

Boyz II Men are back with an excellent album of cover songs from the 70's and 80's. I really miss Michael Mc Cary's deep sexy voice, but this is a good CD even without him. The first single is You Make Me Feel Brand New. This is a very romantic song and one of my favorites Boyz II Men sound so smooth performing this song I love the trio's rendition of the song Let It Whip. It has a new dance sound that will appeal to a lot of listeners both young and old. I also enjoyed the song Close The Door. This song would have been perfect for Michael's McCary deep rich voice, but Nathan sounds nice and so smooth on his lead vocals here. This is a great song to relax and unwind to at the end of the day. Some of my other favorites on this CD is the a cappella version of the Debarge classic Time Will Reveal. Shawn Stockman has a very high and pleasant singing voice, and I think he sounds great performing lead vocals on this song. Boyz II Men harmonize so well and sound great on the song Let's Stay Together. The Boyz sing this classic track with a slick updated R and B sound that is just superb. The Boyz take a good song like Human Nature, and they do it even better. Their voices sound so pretty and mellow together on this track.Throwback is such an enjoyable album to listen to. If you grew up in the 70s and 80s like I did, you will enjoy listening to these songs again being performed by one of the most talented R and B groups ever. Boyz II Men are back!

True Grit is an excellent film. This movie reminds of how entertaining westerns can be. It is about a young girl's deternination for justice after her father is shot and killed by a man named Tom Chaney. The film stars new comer Haliey Steinfield as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn. My favorite quote from the movie is when Mattie says to Rooster that she is looking for someone with true grit in helping her track her father's killer and avenge his death. True Grit is a phrase that describes Mattie's character in the movie. She is a determined young woman blessed with intelligence and courage. Hailey Steinfield's performance is the best I have seen from any actress this past year. The relationship between Rooster and Mattie evolve in the movie.Mattie and Rooster are accompanied on this journey by a man named LeBeouf. He is a ranger and is played by Matt Damon. There is one particularly exciting scene where LeBeouf rescues Mattie's life in the face of danger by Tom Chaney. Steinfield has chemistry with her co stars and that is what makes the movie work for me.The music from the movie is composed by Carter Burwell. There is a beautiful song at the end of the movie entitled Leaning On The Every Lasting Arms. This song is performed by a singer named Iris DeMent. Her voice is very moving. There is instrumental music featured in the movie derived from this tune. Burwell does a great job scoring the film. There is a scene in the movie where Mattie is stuck in a snake pit. Burwell's music in that scene makes me feel a sense of dread at the appropriate time.The film is set in Texas with some parts in New Mexico. The Coen brothers bring out the beauty of these places in the movie. I would love to ride a horse and see this beauty in person if I could. True Grit is definitely one of the best movies of 2010.

I really enjoyed listening to this album. I admire any singer who can sing effortlessly in more than one language. This is what Hayley Westerna does so well in English and Maori. I fell in love with Hayley Westerna's voice after watching the music video for Pokarekare Ana Come Back To Me. Her voice sounds very romantic and soothing. In Trutina is another great track. Hayley hits all the high notes and shows range of her powerful voice. Hayley also sings a great rendition of the church hymm Amazing Grace. Her voice is so uplifting here. I also loved the track Never Say Goodbye. Her delivery and phrasing is flawless and so snooth on this song. The instruments on this album are a perfect compliment to her voice. I love the violin playing on the track Dark Waltz is just lovely. Pure is simply a pure pleasure to listen to. Hayley Westerna is a very talented singer with a bright future.

Oscar winning composer Alan Menken has continued to put out great music following in the tradition of working on other animated Disney hit movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. KD Lang sounds great on the playful song Little Patch Of Heaven. I really like the song Anytime You Need A Friend by the Bleu sisters. It is a great song about friendship that fits the theme of the movie well. Will The Sun ever Shine Again is a beautiful song by Bonnie Raitt. This is a somber and somewhat sad song that Bonnie Raitt sings so well.Tim Mcgraw lends his talents to this awesome soundtrack with the song Wherever the Trail May Lead. It is a song about having someone to lean on when times get tough. Randy Quaid yodels pretty good on one track which is fun to listen to. This soundtrack has some great music. I enjoyed it very much.

Soul Surfer is a very inspirational movie. It really captures the spirit and deternination of teenager Bethany Hamilton. The message of this movie is that faith in God gives a person strength to overcome any obstacle. I am not overally religious, but I think that faith in a higher power is a positive message. AnnaSophia Robb gives an excellent performance as Hamilton, She is a teenager that lost her arm to a shark bite in 1996. There are shots in the movie showing Anna Sophia struggling with the simplest things like cutting vegetables and making a sandwich after losing her arm. Her dedication and her talent for the sport of surfing is what makes this movie entertaining. I admire the skill, balance and coordination that Anna Sophia shows on the surf board. Director Sean Mcnamara makes surfing look like an exciting and competitive sport. There is one shot in the movie that shows Anna Sophia going inside of a wave and then coming out of it. This shot is breathtaking and is a testament to Mcnamara's talent as a director. Dennis Quaid co stars as Tom Hamilton. He is Bethany's father. He gives a good performance as a father who encourages Bethany not to give up her dream as a professional surfer. Carrie Underwood is good in a supporting role as a youth minister who also encourages Bethany not to give out faith in God as after her accident. Helen Hunt plays Bethany's mom Cheri. Her performance is not as good as Quaid's, but she still comes across as a loving mother. This film is filled with good music. There is an uplifting song entitled Set The World On Fire". This song is about the strength of the human spirit. There is a beautiful Hawaiian song entitled "Ho Oheno Keia No Beauty" that includes excellent ukulele playing. This song adds some Hawaiian flavor to the movie. Soul Surfer is a very entertaining film.

Fireflies is Faith Hill's first album in over 3 years. Although she did not write any of the songs on this album, I think that these tracks reflect her feelings and toward each subject in the song. The musicians on this album really shine too. Dan Dugmore plays the steel guitar and banjo on these tracks, and Stuart Duncan is so great on the fiddle. They accompany Faith by providing an interesting, energetic country sound to her vocals. My favorite track is Sunshine Summertime. It is great upbeat song about having fun in the summer by doing things like celebrating with friends, enjoying the sunshine, listening to music, and driving around in cars. Mississippi Girl is a song about how Faith has remained a modest, sweet, humble Southern girl despite her fame as a country music star. Faith shows that she still has incredible vocal range on this song. I also like the title Fireflies. It is a song that reminds us that we should always have something to dream and hope for.There are excellent songs about different aspects of a relationship on this album. If You Ask is a heartwrenching tune about being in love with someone who has a drinking problem. This is a touching song about love and forgiveness. It is one of my favorites, and I think Faith sings it so well. Dearly Beloved is a funny song about how temporary love and committment can be in a marriage sometimes. Stealing Kisses is a song about a lonely wife who wants her husband to show her some affection and tenderness. I think a lot of women can relate to the lyrics in this song. Paris is a very pretty song about how all the little things you would do for someone you love. We Got Nothing But Love To Prove is a very meaningful song about a call for people to work together to put an end to all the violence in our society.Fireflies is the album Faith's fans have been waiting for, and they won't be disappointed. I loved listening to this CD.

I love this new CD from Jacqui Naylor. The Color Five is a delightful mix of original tracks and covers of classic songs. The title of the CD is a reference to all of the musicians who assisted Jacqui in making this album. Every track is superb on this disc. The piano playing is beautiful on the track Blue Moon. Jacqui's voice is filled with hope on this song. Jacqui sounds feisty and confident on the track Hot Legs. Art Khu's guitar playing is very energetic on this song. Easy Ride From Here is an optimistic song about a person taking charge of their own life. Summer time is an upbeat engaging rendition of a classic song. This track really gets me moving. Love For Sale and I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For are two upbeat engaging songs Jon Evans provides a groovy bass on both tracks. I love the subtle romantic violin playing by Yoon Ki Chai on the track Angel Of Mine. This song is about saying good bye to a loved one. Sit And Rest A While is a simple song about slowing down and enjoying life. I like the violin playing on this track too. I love the beat of the track Drive On. The guitar playing by Khu is slick and cool on this song. Here's To Life is a celebration of life. Jacqui sounds so sensual on this track. The piano playing accompanies her vocals so well on this song. History of Our Love and You Don't Know What Love Is are two soothing sounding tracks. Jacqui Naylor is a talented jazz singer and song writer. The Color Five is her best effort to date.

I grew up listening to the music of Michael McDonald, and I'm so happy that all his hit songs are finally on one disc. My favorite track is Michael's duet with James Ingram Yah Mo B There. It is a great song about friendship and trust. Their soulful voices sound good together on this track. Ain't No Mountain High Enough is another highlight on this album. It is an optimistic love song that Michael originally recorded on his Motown album a few years ago. I also enjoyed his duet with Patti LaBelle entitled On My Own from the mid 80's. It is a song about a relationship that didn't work out. Sweet Freedom is an upbeat song about celebrating your freedom. The hits Michael had as a member of the Doobie Brothers are included here. What a Fool Believes is the biggest hit he had with the group. This is a great song about a man who tries to rekindle an old romance with a woman only to find out that she has moved on with her life. The melody created by the keyboard playing of Michael Mcdonald is just as memorable as the words to the song. Taking It to The Street is another great song from the Doobie Brothers. It is a classic song about the division in society between the rich and poor people. I Keep Forgetting is another hit song about hard it is to let go of the feelings you have for a person you were romantically involved with. This Ultimate Collection by Michael Mcdonald is filled with great music. I loved listening to this CD.

My Friend Leonard is a memoir covering the events of about 5 years in the life of James Frey. It is a follow up to the best seller A Million Little Pieces. Leonard is a mentor and a father figure to James and a known criminal. Yet, he exposes James to classic paintings and gives him advice like to live honorably and with dignity.One of my favorite parts in the book is where James celebrates his promotion from a cleaning person to a doorman in a bar by buying and eating cake. Frey also writes very honestly about the anixety and fear he felt working for Leonard as a transporter picking up large amounts of money and delivering it to different places.My Friend Leonard really moved me in some parts like when James learns that his girlfriend Lilly has committed suicide. The pain from that personal loss prevented James from having successful close relationships with women for a long time. Another event in this book that really touched me in this book is where James has to put his much loved pit bull dog to sleep. I could relate to the pain he felt, because I had to the same thing to my dog.The most important thing to remember after reading a book like My Friend Leonard is to live every day like it is your last, because you never know how much time left you have to live. My Friend Leonard is an unique book about the things our friends can teach us about life, It is also about how to deal with personal loss in our lives. I really enjoyed it.

This CD is a delightful surprise from Paul Simon. My favorite track is Father and Daughter. This is a beautiful track about how much a father can love his daughter so much, he would do anything to protect her. How Can You Live In the Northeast is a song about living with a sense of pride and dignity no matter what your religious background is. This song makes interesting references to the threats of floods around the country too. Beautiful is another one of my favorite songs on here. This is a song about it feels to adopt a baby from a foreign country and all the happiness a child can bring to your life. Wartime Prayers is another highlight on this CD. This song is about having faith and hope in a time of war and despair. The lyrics of this song are very moving.Another Galaxy is a lovely song about what it feels like to leave home and explore the world on your own. Outrageous is a great song about all the social injustices and blessings in the world today. Everything About It Is A Love Song is a standout track about the beauty of the things in nature like the trees, birds, and the wind. I love the beautiful imagery Paul Simon creates for the listener on this track. That's Me is a fun song about a person moving through different stages in life trying to find their own identity. I liked the beat of the track Sure Don't Feel Like Love. This is a good song about how some people are guided by their conscience when making decisions. I really enjoyed listening to Surprise. I think Paul Simon continues to write songs that people can relate to.

Halcyon Days is an excellent album by Bruce Hornsby. He has been one of my favorite singers and songwriters for a while now. I loved all the tracks on this CD. Bruce Hornsby is a good story teller. This ability always comes through in his music. The first track Gonna Be Some Changes Made has good background vocals by Sting. It is a song about taking the law into your own hands and about how quickly things can change. Another one of my favorite songs is Heir Gordon. It is a fun song about a man who gets everything he owns from the generosity of other people. This song has a nice blues sound, and Bruce sounds great on the piano like he always does.Dreamland is such a pretty song. This song proves that Bruce is a talented vocalist with a smooth voice as well as a good musician. Elton John has a great short vocal solo on this song.Hooray For Tom is another good song on this album. It is about being happy for the success someone has and working hard to achieve more for yourself. I could really relate to the lyrics of this song. Circus on the Moon is an excellent song about the job of someone who works at a circus. This song is about how the efforts of a someone who works with animals go unnoticed and underappreciated. I really liked the images of the animals in this song. Song F is an instrumental song performed in the F key. Bruce shows the beautiful simplicity of his instrument on this song. I liked it very much. Mirror on the Wall is another highlight for me on this album. This song is about wondering about all the things a person can do with their life when they look in the mirror. Lost in the Snow is a cute song about feeling helpless being lost in the snow. Bruce performs this song with so much zest and energy. I had so much fun listening to this CD.

Katharine McPhee's voice gives me goose bumps. These two tracks are just a preview of her talent. Her rendition of Over the Rainbow is so sensual and romantic. I loved her cover of this classic tune. For me, this song has always been about having hope and being at peace with yourself. My Destiny is an excellent track. This song has the wonderful message that anything is possible if you work hard. I look forward to hearing more from Katharine in the future. I hope she will sing more up tempo songs to bring out her personality more.

I loved reading this book. It was an eye opener for me, because I did not know of the atrocities that took place in India. Although the characters in this book are fictional, the events described in the book are not. Indian people are punished and killed for simply exercising their rights every human being is entitled to. Children are beaten in this book just because they desire an education. People are tortured and hung simply because they want to participate in the voting process. Young people are forced to endure vasectomies in order to control the population. All the characters in this work hard in the midst of all this travesty.The main character is Dina who is denied a complete education at the age of 12 by her brother after her parents pass away. She unfortunately becomes a widow at the age of 24. She is undaunted by her lot in life, because she eventually learns how to sew and make clothes. Ishvar and Om are two tailors employed by Dina. They are from a caste of the population that work as cobblers that make leather products. They receive the opportunity to learn a new skill and become tailors. They want nothing more than to make enough money to return to their village. Maneck is a college student taken in as a boarder by Dina to supplement her income. What is most interesting about this book is tht all of these characters are so mentally tough despite the harsh environment.A Fine Balance is compelling reading. I enjoyed reading and learning about the history and culture of India so much.

This is a very good CD of Christmas music from James Taylor. Jingle Bells is my favorite track. I've never heard this song performed in a blues style before, and it sounds very good. Dave Grusin and Chris Botti lend their talents on the piano and trumpet respectively on the track Winter Wonderland. They give this song an unique smooth sounding quality. In The Bleak Midwinter is a new song to me. I love the sincerity in James Taylor's voice. Dave Grusin's piano playing is very good too. The musicial arrangement on this track is beautiful. I like the duet entitled Baby It's Cold Outside with Natalie Cole, because it sounds so romantic. Go Tell It On The Mountain is an upbeat song. This is the first time I've heard all the lyrics to this classic song, and I really like it. James Taylor plays the guitar as well as he sings on the track River. This is a song about missing a loved one at Christmas time. Auld Lang Syne is a beautiful track about the meaning and importance of friendship. James Taylor has always had the ability to touch people with his voice. The music on this CD is proof of that. It is simply delightful.

I really enjoyed listening to this self titled CD from The Little Willies. I love Norah's easy listening vocals on most of these tracks. Roll On, Love Me and Night Life are my favorites These tracks really showcase Norah's talent as a piano player and singer. Best of All Possible Worlds is an enjoyable song to tap your feet too. Other standout tracks on this album are Roly Poly and Gotta Get Drunk and Lou Reed. These tracks sound good, and they are very funny. Easy as Rain and No Place To Fall are very sweet heartfelt tracks. Streets of Baltimore is a great story song about a couple moving to a new city trying to start a new life. I enjoyed Richard Jullian's vocals on the track very much. Tennesee Stud is the track that best features all the musicians in the band. They play and compliment each other so well on this song. The Little Willies is one of my favorite CDs of 2006.

Les Paul and his wife Mary Ford are legends in jazz music. My favorite track on this disc is "I'm Sitting On The Top Of The World." Nobody could play the electric guitar as masterfully as Les Paul. Mary Paul's voice is so sensual on the track "I'm A Fool To Care." I love this track. "Tennessee Waltz" and "Vaya Con Dios" are classic romantic tunes. These tracks makes me think of someone special. "In The Mood" is another excellent song that puts me in a great mood. "Bye Bye Blues" is an uptempo track that stands out as one of the best here. "I Really Don't Want To Know" is a pretty song. I love the tenderness in Mary Ford's voice on this track. This disc is filled with great music.

Wilson Pickett will always be considered as one of the greatest soul singers of all time. His songs cover such a wide range of emotions and feelings like few performers can. My favorite song is Land of 1000 dances. This is a good song to play at parties, because it gets everyone dancing and feeling good. Mustang Sally is another highlight on this CD. This song is a very groovy tribute to a woman with a fast car. I love the energy in his voice on this song. Wilson's cover of Hey Jude is very unique. I have never heard this song performed in a soulful style before style before, and I really enjoyed it. Don't Let The Green Grass Fool Ya is another highlight on this CD. This is a song about a man trying to convince the woman he loves to stay with him and not go off with someone else. In The Midnight Hour and I'm A Midnight Mover are such sensual and soulful classic songs. I love the music of Wilson Pickett.

The Muppets is an excellent family film. The plot is simple. An evil land developer played by Chris Cooper wants to tear down the Muppet theater to drill for oil. It is up to the Muppets to raise money and put on a telethon talent show to save their beloved theater. The problem is that all the Muppets have gone their separate ways. Jason Segal and Amy Adams star as Gary and Mary. They play boyfriend and girlfriend. They have great chemistry on the big screen. I really believe these two people are in love. Gary's brother is a new Muppet named Walter. He has a talent for whistling that he shows in one of the most uplifting scenes of the film. There is a lot of humor in this movie. It comes from the other Muppet favorites like Fozzie Bear and Animal, but all of the Muppets shine in this movie about team work. Every Muppet movie has celebrity cameos. This movie has cameos from Neil Patrick Harris, Jack Black and Selena Gomez. One of the fun things about this movie is trying to see how many celebrities I could recognize.The music is the strongest aspect of the movie. The film contains the songs "Me and Julio Down By The Schoolyard" and "We Built This City". I love these songs from my childhood. This film also includes the new tune "Life's A Happy Song". The movie also contains the classic Muppet show theme and my favorite tune "The Rainbow Connection". This song was featured in the original Muppet movie in 1979. The hopeful spirit of this song will always move me. The Muppets is one of the best family films of the year.

This is a very good soundtrack. It has an excellent mix of modern rock and classic rock songs. I really liked the title track by the School of Rock. It is a great rock song. Jack Black may not have the best voice, but the kids in the band can really play. The other song by the School of Rock It's a Long Way To The Top is another good song that highlights these talented young musicians on individual musical solos.I enjoyed the classic rock songs especially Sunshine of Your Love by Cream. It has one of the best opening guitar riffs I have ever heard. I also enjoyed listening to Edge of Seventeen by Stevie Nicks and Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin. I haven't heard these songs in years, and they sound great. I loved the songs by The Who and The Doors included on this soundtrack too. Heal Me, I'm Heartsick by No Vacancy is a beautiful rock song that I can listen to over and over. I hope to hear more from No Vacancy in the future. The School Of Rock is the one of the best soundtracks of the year. It has a great mix of old and new songs on it.

Around The Sun is a good album. It is good to hear REM still making music after 20 plus years together as a band. Not every song on this CD is a hit, but I think there are still enough highlights on this album for me to recommend it. I loved the first track Leaving New York. It is a sad but pretty romantic song about the pain of leaving someone you love behind. Michael Stipe has always had great emotional quality in his voice. He sounds really good on this first track. I liked the second This is an awesome song about we should not be afraid to explore anything in life. This song reminds us that time is precious and that we should savor it.The Outsiders is a good song about how what it feels like to be homeless. There is a nice rap by Q Tip on this track. I really liked this part, and I enjoyed listening to this song. High Speed Train is a slow, subtle sounding song about the things we would do for the person we love. This song is very pretty. Boy In the Well is a song about the pressure of trying to live up to the expectations of other people and constantly looking for approval for them. This song is slow and sad, but I thought the lyrics were very powerful. I also liked the song Aftermath. This song is about how quickly society changes. This song is also about trying to find your own identity in this ever changing world. Michael Stipe's voice sounds engaging and rather pleasant on this song. I think that is rare on this album. I enjoyed listening to Around the Sun. I think most fans of REM would enjoy this CD too.

The Good Earth is a classic novel with memorable characters and interesting themes. Pearl Buck describes the lifestyle and customs of the Chinese through the eyes of a farmer named Wang Lung.The earth symbolizes many things in this book. It is a symbol of pride and the primary way a farmer provides for his family. The earth also symbolizes wealth as the main character Wang Lung works hard to buy more land.Wang Lung's uncle is a lazy man and a constant source of trouble to Wang Lung.Pearl Buck presents two very different female characters in The Good Earth. Wang Lung's loyal wife Olan is a former child slave who never complains. She is not portrayed as a physically desirable woman, because her feet are not bound according to Chinese custom. Her unbound feet make her a valuable and productive worker while working on the farm though. Olan gives birth to three sons and two daughters. I found it interesting that the success and prosperity followed the birth of her sons. Poverty and hard times followed the birth of her daughters. Olan makes the ultimate sacrifice by taking the life of her infant daughter who is born during a famine and is seen as only as a burden. Lotus is Wang Lung's mistress. She is beautiful but spoiled and lazy. Olan resents the affection Wang Lung gives Lotus.The second half of the novel is set in the overcrowded city of Kiangsu filled with lazy rich men who seem to do nothing but seek pleasure.Pearl Buck has characters and themes in The Good Earth that I think everyone can relate to and identify with. I think this is the reason The Good Earth is still being read today over 70 years since it was first published. The Good Earth is one of Oprah's finest book club picks.

I don't know the difference between bluegrass music and country or folk music, but I know what I like. Nickel Creek simply makes music that appeals to a wide audience of fans no matter what their tastes are. The mandolin, violin, and banjo are the main instruments played on most of these tracks. This is the first CD I bought where these instruments are performed in the spotlight and not in the background.My favorite song is When In Rome. This song is about how each person should do what feels right to them and not just follow the crowd. I'm going to buy a pair of clogs so I can dance to this song the next time I listen to it. It is very fun to move to. The fiddle playing is so good. The title track is a song about how people should try to keep the fire in their relationships alive. The banjo playing on this track gives this song a pretty sweet country sound.Tomorrow is a Long Time is another one of my favorite tracks on this album. It features the sweet and clear vocals of Sara Watkins who also plays the violin in the group. This song is about missing someone you are in love with. Stumptown is a lively instrumental track that just makes you feel good. The instruments performed on this song creates an enjoyable symphony of sound.Can't Complain is another of my favorite tracks. This song is about how men can unfortunately cheat and lie to a woman. Chris Thile sings from the heart here and there is a honesty in his voice that makes you believe that he is singing from experience. Jealous Of The Moon is another good song on this CD in my opinion. This song is kind of philosophical, because it reminds us that taking chances in life is the only way we will grow as individuals. All three performers harmonize so well on this song. I really liked it. I enjoyed the music on this CD very much. I think the music of Nickel Creek is fresh and original.

Sheryl Crow is probably one of the most talented songwriters and musicians out today. This CD really showcases her versatility as both. She sings about cutting loose and having fun on the songs Soak Up The Sun and All I Want to Do. They are very good tunes to dance to. I loved the hit duet Picture with Kid Rock. His voice and Sheryl Crow's voice sound great together. Sheryl Crow is so good singing about the pain and difficulty of trying to get over failed relationships. Her vocal delivery on the songs Strong Enough and The Difficult Kind are very moving. The First Cut is the Deepest sounds better than the original version by Cat Stevens.I loved Sheryl Crow's songs about adventure and escape. Steve McQueen is a great rock song about rebellion and fast cars. I have always liked her choices of song titles too. I love the song title If It Makes You Happy and Every Day Is A Winding Road, because they always sounded interesting and somewhat philosophical to me. This CD is a wonderful collection and retrospective of Sheryl Crow's musical career. I enjoyed it very much.

The clear distinctive voice of Luther Vandross will live on forever. Dance With My Father is an excellent album of songs about falling in and out of love. My favorite song on this album is Dance With My Father. It is a beautiful song about wishing that his late father could be reunited with his family one more time. Send Me A Rose is another great track. It is a very romantic song about doing all the little things we should do to keep the romance in our relationships alive. Right in the Middle is another lyrical gem. Luther reminds us that every relationship goes through some good times and bad times in this song. He duets with Beyonce on The Closer I Get to You. This is a pretty cover song of a classic by Roberta Flack. She Saw You is another one of my favorites on this CD. It is about how a woman catches her man cheating on her with someone else. I love Luther's smooth vocals on the song If I Didn't Know Better. Luther sings beautifully to his listeners about the difference between being someone's friend and lover in this song. Dance With My Father is Luther Vandross' final musical masterpiece.

In Between Dreams by Jack Johnson is really good. I'm glad his music is getting more exposure on the radio and videos. He is a very talented singer and songwriter. The best song is Sitting, Waiting, Wishing. This is a great song about waiting to be with someone you are interested in romantically and feeling frustrated by it. Better Together is a very pretty love song. It is very melodic and sweet. He really shows off his skill as a guitar player on this song too. Banana Pancakes is another highlight on this album. This is a very cute song is about feeling lazy and enjoying life. Jack picks up the pace with the song Staple it Together. This song really gets you moving. Do you Remember is another one of my favorite songs. It is about all the memories you have with the person you love like having a special place and enjoying music. I love this CD, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

This is an excellent CD from Hayley Westerna. Her voice is so soothing and clear. My favorite is the track "Whispering Hope" This is such an uplifting track. I love Hayley's vocals here. "Let Me Lie" and "Abide With Me" are two tracks with a peaceful spiritual sound. I love the flute and piano playing on these songs. "Danny Boy" is another highlight here. This is a classic Irish song about the passing of a dear friend. It is a sad but very beautiful track. "Sonny" is another excellent track about a hardworking lonely man who is dedicated to his farm and home. "The Water is Wide" is a very soothing track. The piano playing sounds so good on this song. Hayley picks up the pace with the track "Summer Fly" The violin playing gives this track a nice lively tempo. "Shenandoah" is a track about the beauty of the lovely river. This song is very moving. "Scarborough Fair" and "Summer Rain" are very romantic sounding tracks. This is a very enjoyable CD filled with lovely music.

Grammy Award Winner Alicia Keys is back with a strong sophomore effort. I love the way she phrases the lyrics in her songs. She sings about the different aspects of being in love so well. Her voice is smooth, sexy and soulful. My favorite song on this album is You Don't Know My Name, because I like the idea of a woman making the first move on a man she really likes.I love the way Alicia sings the track Heartburn. This song has a lot of energy, and it made me want to move around and dance. Diary is another stand out track in my opinion. It is a great song about having someone in your life who you can trust to tell your secrets and is loyal to you.I also loved the song If I Aint Got You. I think this song is a reminder that material things don't really bring you lasting satisfaction and The only thing that matters in life is having someone to love. Slow Down is an excellent song about trying to slow down in a relationship and getting to know the person you are attracted to. I really enjoyed listening Diary of Alicia Keys. She is a true talent who will be around for many years.

This book is perfect for people who love to travel but cannot afford to. This book is so well written and researched. I loved reading about the geography and history of all the places described in this book. All of these destinations seem so exotic and exciting. There are so many interesting places in this book such as national parks, museums, rivers, festivals, restaurants, mountains, places to view art, nature, and amazing works of architecture.I would love to go scuba diving off Australia's Great Barrier Reef and look at 1,500 varieties of fish. I would love to go to Egypt to take a cruise on the Nile River and view ancient ruins and royal tombs. I would like to see camels race in the Sinai desert. I would to see the artistic elegance of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. I wouldn't mind visiting the breathtaking marble architecture of the Taj Mahal in India either. I never knew some of these places even existed like Count Dracula's castle in Romania and Santa's village in Helsinki Finland. I would enjoy horseback riding through the mountains of South Africa. Looking at thousands of beautiful women in Ipanema Beach in Rio De Janeiro Brazil seems like a lot of fun too.A lot of fun destinations described in this book are in the United States and North America too. I would love to go on a hot air baloon ride in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It would be exciting to watch the Iditarod dogsled race in Anchorage Alaska or go white river rafting in West Virginia. I would love to go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba Canada. Montreal Quebec would be an interesting destination choice for a lot of people. It is home to a world film festival, a jazz festival, and an international fireworks competition.1000 places to see before you die is the most comprehensive world travel guide I have ever seen. I learned so much about different countries and their histories. I will take this book with me on every trip I go on in the future.

Water For Elephants is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year so far. It is an entertaining film that features an actor and actress who have perfect on screen chemistry. Robert Pattinson is a veternarian student named Jacob who hops aboard a train after his parents are killed in a car accident. He discovers the train is a travelling circus. Reese Witherspoon plays a circus performer named Marlena. She is married to Albert who runs the circus show. He is played by Christoph Waltz. I like how the relationship between Pattinson and Witherspoon starts off as friendship and blossoms into a romance. Christoph Waltz has a talent for playing a villain. His only ambition is to pack people under the circus tent. His character creates a romantic tension in the movie. Hal Holbrook rounds out the cast. He is the narrator of the story playing the role of older version of Jacob. Holbrook is sentimental and funny in the early scenes of the movie.I am amazed at the kinds of tricks and moves that director Francis Lawrence gets the elephant to do. There are a few scenes of animal cruelty in the film. I hope this does not turn people away from seeing this movie. No animals were hurt in this film. These scenes are merely staying true to the spirit of the novel. There are also many scenes in which animals are treated with gentleness and care. Water For Elephants is a film set in 1931 during the Depression. Composer James Newton Howard captures the spirit of that time with his score. His score is exciting and romantic at times. The soundtrack also features a song by Bessie Smith entitled "I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl". This is a sassy blues tune that I have never heard of before. I absolutely love this song and the entire soundtrack. Water For Elephants is romantic, funny and dramatic at different parts. This combination makes this movie one of the best I have seen all year.

The sport of soccer is a source of national pride for the people of Brazil during the World Cup. This is one theme in the movie The Year My Parents Went On Vacation. Another theme of the movie is the separation of children from their parents during the Cold War and the opppression of people during the military dictatorship. Director Cao Hamburger presents these themes in this beautiful movie set in Brazil in 1970.I watched this movie with English subtitles. There are some brief parts in the movie with no English subtitles to accompany the Portuguese dialogue, but it didn't prevent me from understanding it. I like the friendship of young boy Mauro and the elderly Polish Jewish man who takes care of him after his grandfather dies. I also love the friendship between Mauro and Hanna in the movie. Michel Joelsas is an excellent young actor who gives an authentic performance as a boy separated from his parents in the lead role. The performance of all the other actors in the movie are excellent as well. I enjoyed watching the bonus features on this DVD. There are interviews with the director and members of the cast. This is a moving and informative film about a country I knew very little about.

Reading a novel about a hermaphrodite is something I never thought I would enjoy, but I was wrong. Middlesex is an excellent book. Jeffery Eugenides is a talented and insightful writer. He describes how Greek immigrants of both sexes had to work hard to survive in Detroit in the early part of the 20th century. Lefty is a fictional character in the novel. I loved reading about how hard he worked to improve his life. He started working at a factory making car engines, and he worked diligently to become a successful bar owner. Eugenidies' description of the race riots in Detroit in 1967 is very vivid. I could picture people looting shops and setting them on fire. I have no idea how a hermaphrodite feels, and I think Eugenides does a good job writing about how it feels to live as one. The main character is a hermaphrodite named Callie. Eugenides writes about Callie's confusion and frustration about not developing like other girls as a teenager. This is very moving. He also writes about her experiences with drugs and having sexual relations with a female classmate. Middlesex is very much a coming of age novel because of the self exploration element. I enjoyed reading how Callie's parents loved and treated her unconditionally. Middlesex is a novel that reminds people to accept and embrace individuals with gender differences.

Stevie Nicks is one my favorite singers. Even though I already have most these songs on other CDs, I didn't have the music videos for her songs until now. This CD and combo contains most of her greatest hits as a member of Fleetwood Mac and as a solo artist. "Dreams" is my favorite track. This is her hit as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1977. "Silver Spring" is another hit Stevie had with Fleetwood Mac that is included here. This song is very touching. I love her solo hits like "Stand Back", "Talk To Me" and "I Can't Wait." I remember dancing to the songs in the 80's. I enjoyed the listening to the commentary for the song "Edge Of Seventeen." Stevie wrote this song after the death of John Lennon and her uncle. This is a very personal song, and it became one of her biggest solo hits. I love the duets "Leather and Lace" with Don Henley and "Stop Dragging my Heart Around" with Tom Petty too. "Whenever I Call You Friend" is missing from this set of songs, but that is okay. This DVD and CD combo includes great songs that are lesser known like the duet "Sorcerer" with Sheryl Crow. This is a really good song and video. "Everyday" is another lesser known song that I really liked. This song is cute and the tone of Stevie's voice is great. I loved watching the videos and listening to the music on this excellent CD and DVD combo.

I enjoyed reading this novel very much. The setting of the novel is the Forbidden City of China in Peking in 1852. Anchee Min describes the life of Princess Orchid in such specific detail. She is served 99 individual dishes at every meal, but she does not have the privacy to use the toilet by herself.I loved reading about how Orchid ascended from her status as a mere concubine to becoming the ruler of China. Orchid is a very courageous woman. She sneaks out of the forbidden city dressed as a commoner and goes to a brothel to learn how to please a man. Orchid is the only concubine to bear the Emperor a son which instantly elevates her status. Orchid literally runs China when her husband's health declines. I enjoyed how Orchid struggles to raise and teach her son how to be a good ruler. Orchid competes with another one of the Emperor's wives named Nuharoo for her son's love which is interesting to read.I did not know that eunuchs played such an important role in the running of the Forbidden City. The head eunuch was responsible for supervising the vaults which contained gold, silver, tea, and silk. He was also responsible for providing the imperial court with sacrificial animals, grains and fruits for religious ceremonies. The head eunuch also oversaw the departments that maintained the palaces, temples, and gardens.Empress Orchid has very interesting characters besides Orchid. I loved the loyalty of Orchid's eunuch Antehai. He has pledged his life to serve Orchid, but still dreams of having a family and being free. Su Shin is an advisor to the Emperor who challenges Orchid's authority and tries to kill her.Foreigners tried to impose their ways on the Chinese which was an overwhelming burden on Emperor Hsien Feng. There was religious strife between Christian missionaries and Chinese people. Missionaries were murdered and churches were burned. British and French soldiers attacked Chinese forts and villages. were burned by foreign invaders leaving many Chinese people homeless.Anchee Min writes with such detail about every aspect of Chinese life in the mid 19th century. Life in the Forbidden City was lonely for everyone including the Emperor Hsien Feng who sadly died at a young age without knowing his mother's love. Although Orchid became the ruler of China, she yearned for a man's companionship after being widowed at a young age. Anchee Min makes the reader feel for all the characters which I think is the mark of a great writer. Empress Orchid is an excellent read.

KT Tunstall is a talented vocalist. She plays the guitar better than anyone I have heard in a long time. My favorite track is Black Horse and Cherry Tree. This song always makes me want to get up and dance. Her vocals are so sensual on this track. Other Side of The World is a romantic song about a long distance relationship that did not work out. Suddenly I See is a fun song about finding clarity and direction in life. Under The Weather is a pretty song about how a person's mood matches the weather. Miniature Disasters is a song about learning to be patient with yourself. This song is also about how little setbacks can really throw a person off track. KT sounds very honest and soulful on this song. Universe and U is a cute song about seeing the world through the eyes of a child. This is a simple and deep song. I really enjoyed this track. Eye To The Telescope is an entertaining CD by a talented musician.

Bo Bice is a very versatile singer, and this will make him a star in the music business. He can sing a slow song and a fast song both equally well. The two tracks on this CD single show that Bo is a performer who is capable of creating a wide range of emotions with his voice. Richie Sanbora of Bon Jovi sounds awesome here playing the electric guitar on Vehicle. I love this song. It will be perfect when I'm driving around in my car. It will also be a great song to listen to the next time I'm hanging out with my friends having fun. Inside Your Heaven is a pop love song that doesn't have the best lyrics. Despite that fact, I think Bo really moves the listener with his vocals here. The future is bright for Bo Bice.

The Corrections takes a good hard look at the complex relationships within a family. Each member of The Lambert family has their own faults. The patriarch of the family is Alfred Lambert. He is a retired railroad engineer who works hard to support his family. However, Alfred doesn't show any affection toward any member of his family. Alfred emotionally distances himself from his family. This has an effect on everyone. Enid Lambert is his long suffering wife who is taken for granted in this book by her husband. Enid sacrifices his career as a book keeper to raise a family of 3 children Gary, Chip and Denise.Alfred never praises his wife for a job well done. Enid practically raises their 3 children all by herself, because Alfred does not provide any emotional support for his children.Enid becomes Al's care taker when his health declines. This becomes a burden for her which doesn't sit well with her children especially Gary.At the beginning of his father's illness, Gary urges that Al should be placed in a care home. This would relieve Enid of her obligation to care for him. This is a major issue in this book and society today about who should take of the elderly when they get sick.Gary is a depressed family man who is unable to express his feelings. Gary is incapable of showing warmth and detaches himself from everybody. This is a trait that he obviously inherited from his father He fights with his wife over meaningless things not telling the truth about how she hurt herself. He is bitter towards his parents especially his mother for telling him how to run his life particularly how to raise his kids.Chip is a former college professor who loses his job after anaffair with a student. Chip feels his parents don't approve of his life or his job. To Chip, Alfred's lack of affection toward him as a child solidifies Chip's belief that Al never loved or understood him.Denise is a successful cook who happens to be a lesbian. Denise's shortcoming is her failure to be honest with herself about her sexual orientation. This leads to the breakdown of her relationship with her boss and her bosses wife. She has an intimate relationship with both of them. Denise is almost the mirror image of her mother in the sense that she feels obligated to take on a lot of a responsibility and is put upon by other people.This book is a good escape for people who perceive their problems and relationships to be too great or stressful. I enjoyed reading The Corrections.

I knew never that poetry could be so fun. The poems in this book are about a wide variety of subjects that are enjoyable and easy to understand. Jeep Cherokee by Bruce Jacobs is one of my favorite poems. It is a poem about how a car is a symbol of freedom and adventure. Jacobs explains how a car can often be a reflection of a person's personality.The Cowardice of Husbands by David Kirby is another favorite of mine. It is a poem about how some husbands hate to do some things with their wives like go to plays, operas, and sometimes even sit through poetry readings. This poem is a honest and truthful opinion about the relationship between men and women. Birthday Poem by Erin Murphy really sticks out too. It is about a woman trying to remember the last name of her friend who died of breast cancer. It is a very moving poem about about friendship and how much our friends mean to us.I really enjoyed the poem Dorie Off To Atlanta by Mark Halliday. Reading this poem is like listening to a conversation between two girlfriends about a mutual friend they have dating a great guy. Valentine is a very clever poem by Carol Ann Duffy. It is a poem about how she feels how an onion would be a good gift to give someone for Valentine's Day. I liked the originality of these two poems very much.Katia Kapovich's Painting A Room is a good example about how doing something so ordinary can be symbolic and meaningful. She dedicates this poem to her friend who paints her apartment in Russia before coming to America in 1989. She reflects on her memories of living in the apartment like her past romances, old jobs, and night phone calls. It is a very touching poem and one of my favorites.Eleven Thousand And One by Darcie Dennigan is a very lengthy poem about how a young woman celebrating her birthday in a bar with her girlfriends. She compares the woman in this poem named Ella with a Saint named Ursula. Both characters encounter similar painful experiences with men. I think Dennigan describes the parallels so well in her poem.I really enjoyed reading all the poems in this book. Reading this book has inspired me to continue writing my own poetry and expressing my feelings in a creative way. I hope Billy Collins puts out another collection of poems like this soon.

Black Cadillac is an excellent CD by Roseanne Cash. My favorite song is the title track. It is a wonderful tribute to her late father Johnny. I loved the groovy bass playing by Michael Rhodes on this track. I Was Watching You is another standout song about how much Roseanne loves and misses her father. What really stands out is the beautiful piano playing that accompanies Roseanne's moving vocals. Home on the Lake is another one of my favorites on this album. It is a sentimental song featuring great acoustic guitar playing bout Roseanne's memories of growing up in a house in Tennesee.The World Unseen is another highlight on this CD. This is another nice track with very romantic piano playing. This song is about trying to make a connection with someone. I also loved the track God Is In the Roses. This is a beautiful song about the beauty of nature. Black Cadillac is Roseane Cash's best work. The songs are so heartfelt and personal, and I loved it.

Death Race is one of the best movies of the year. This movie is non stop action. I think that Jason Statham gives the performance of his career. Joan Allen gives an excellent performance too. I loved watching the bonus features on this DVD. Director Paul Anderson and the actors had so much fun making this movie. They share their experiences of making the movie on the bonus features. I loved watching how the cars were transformed into driving machines equipped with weapons. I enjoyed everything about this DVD.

This is a cast recording of a musical about teenage sexuality. This is also a musical about what can happen when parents do not communicate with their children. It is a sad show with a serious tone, but the music is great. Duncan Sheik did an excellent job composing these songs. There are so many strong performances here. Lea Michelle has a beautiful singing voice on track "Mama Who Bore Me" She plays the female lead Wendela. Lea Michelle is also superb on the track "Whispering" My other favorite track is "The Bitch Of Living" John Gallagher Jr. is so good singing lead vocals with the cast. This rock song really pumps me up. "I Believe is a such a pretty track, and so is the track Song Of The Purple Summer" These songs are so optimistic and hopeful. I really liked it. Lauren Pitchard shines in her role as IIse. She is a victim of child abuse. She sings the very moving song "The Dark I Know" This song is very powerful and it is one of my favorites on this recording. Jonathan Groff performs the track "The Mirror Blue Night" beautifully. This is a great song about the passage of time. I enjoyed every track on this recording, and I hope to see the show someday.

The Autobiography of a yogi has sparked my interest in reading spiritual books like the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita for the insightful pearls of wisdom they contain. These insights really make the book enjoyable to me. The Gita is India's most important spiritual text. The goal of the science of yoga is stated in Psalms 46:10 in the Bible. The goal of yoga is to achieve inner stillness so that a person can know God. I am not an overly religious person, but I do think inner stillness can be a worthy goal for every person. This book is filled with quotes from the Bible and the Gita. There is a passage from the Bhagavad Gita that talks about how the nature of man is to be active and not lazy.The writing in this book is very vivid. Yogananda's description of how beautiful Kashmir is makes me want to book a flight just to see the beauty of nature there. I would love to see the caves and cathedrals in southern India described in this book.This autobiography is not easy to read, but the information is valuable. Some of the names and words in the book are hard to pronounce. One thing is certain. Paramahansa Yogananda had a fascinating life. There is one photo in the book that shows him addressing a crowd of people. The caption under this photo states that in thirty two years in the West, he taught 100,000 people the practice of Kriya yoga. Kriya yoga is a form of yoga that relaxes a person senses and organs. It can improve concentration and quality of sleep.Several miracles are described in this book that are hard to believe. There is a picture of a woman who did not eat or drink anything for over fifty years. There is another incidence of a miracle where the author suddenly has the ability to speak English just by praying to his guru. This book suggests that anyone is capable of performing a miracle if their belief in the Divine is strong enough.The beliefs of Paramahansa Yogananda influenced a diversity of people like Gandhi and plant scientist Luther Burbank. Millions of regular citizens all over the world continue to be influenced by his form of meditation. One of the beliefs of his self realization fellowship is that yoga can liberate a person for physical disease and improve mental and spiritual health. This is a very hopeful message that makes this book so appealing to me. I highly recommend this book.

Fall on your Knees is not one of Oprah's best book picks. I had too many questions about what happened to some of the main characters after I finished it. This book left me hanging at the end after such a promising start. James Piper is a self educated man with 3 daughters. He supports his family as a piano tuner and a later as a shoe maker.Kathleen is the oldest daughter and the apple of her father's eye. She is encouraged by James to pursue a singing career. Kathleen has her life cut short at the age of 19 while giving birth to her twins. Her death sets the tone for the whole book. Mercedes is the responsible daughter who takes care of the family after their mother dies prematurely of a stroke. Mercedes is the only character who truly finds happiness in this book as she becomes a successful teacher later in life. Frances is the independent and often rebellious daughter who finds brief contentment as a dancer and a singer. Frances is no strange to pain. She suffers a miscarriage and also dies prematurely of complications due to her alcohol habit.The book never talks about what happens to the youngest daughter Lily after she leaves Cape Breton Island. She is the daughter of Kathleen. Lily is given her mother's diary as a teenager. Her diary uncovers the most shocking secret of all about Kathleen's life. The fact that Kathleen was a lesbian and the way in which her father found out about this was a total surprise for me I was expecting an extra chapter about Lily's life after this bombshell of a revelation. The book skips Lily's life entirely between the age of 15 and 45. I wasn't pleased with this. A final chapter should be have written exclusively focusing on Lily's life and her goals and dreams.

"Wall.e" is an unique animated movie. This science fiction cartoon about a love story between two robots is very touching. Wall.e reminds people what can happen to the Earth if we don't take care of it. This film offers hope that the environment can change too. The animation is dazzling. The bonus features are excellent too. The animated short "Presto" is very funny. The other animated short is "Burn.e". This is pretty fun to watch too. The other cool bonus feature is the commentary about how sound designs are created. It features Ben Burtt who created all the sounds for the movie. He provides a brief interesting history about sound design in movies too. This DVD includes two great deleted scenes that were not in the movie. They are very entertaining to watch. Another thing I love about the movie is the excellent new song "Down To Earth" by Peter Gabriel. Jeff Garlin, Kathy Najimy, John Ratzenburger lend their voice talents to one of the best movies of the year. It is truly delightful.

America's Women is the most comprehensive, informative, and entertaining book about the history of women I have ever read. There are many achievements by female pioneers I never even heard of. Nellie Bly was a newspaper reporter who became a national celebrity when she went around the world in 80 days in 1888. Sarah Josepha Hale became the first female editor of a fashion and advice magazine in 1836. Phillis Wheatley was an extraordinary female slave who learned to speak fluent English in a year and a half. She was the first American writer to achieve international fame with her poetry. She was also credited in persuading George Washington to allow black men to serve in the Continetal Army. I also learned about Ellen Swallow Richards who became the founder of home economics in the early 20th century Girls were able to take chemistry, biology, and geology classes under her theory that it would help them become better homemakers.The causes that women in history have fought for are logical, diverse, and interesting. Women have fought for the right to vote, the prohibition of alcohol, and the sexual purity of men which I found interesting. Women also won the right to schooling during the Revolutionary War which I never knew.There were some people I only recoginized by name in this book. However, after reading about their accomplishments, I had a better understanding of what their influence was. Jane Addams was the founder of a housing settlement called Hull House in Chicago. She provided housing for thousands of poor people and immigrants in the early part of the 20th century. Eleanor Roosevelt was a model for future first ladies. She wanted to give black people equal access to government services. She aimed to improve housing conditions for all people. She seeked for ways to stimulate the economy during the Great Depression and World War 2.America's Women covers every subject related to women with such depth and accuracy. Gail Collins really traces well how the attitudes about education, women in the work place, family, and even sex has evolved over 400 years. Today women are more educated and more self confident about their decisions than ever before. They have made a mark in every field of endeavor. America's Women is an excellent book.

I enjoyed listening to Motown 2 so much. Michael McDonald sounds great on these classic hits from Motown's golden age from 1960s and 70s. He sings songs originally performed by such artists like Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Stevie Wonder.My favorite track is Michael's rendition of the Marvin Gaye hit Whats Going On. Michael sings this song so well. This song is about the hope for peace and a call to stop social injustice around the world The lyrics in this song are so emotional. I loved Michael McDonald's cover of this song so much.Michael McDonald also sings an excellent rendition of Smokey Robinson's song I Second That Emotion. This song is very upbeat and a little more soulful than the original. I really loved the song Nowhere To Run also. This track really rocks, and it will get you out of your seat. Nowhere to run is a major highlight on this album for me.Another highlight on this album for me is the song Baby I Need Your Lovin originally sung by the Four Tops. Michael McDonald sings this song with such energy and spirit. This song brought a smile to my face when I listened to it.I was not famillar with all the songs on this album, but that did not stop me from enjoying this album. Michael sings a very pretty duet with the talented Toni Braxton entitled Stop, Look and Listen to Your Heart. I've never heard this song before, but I loved it. This is just a beautiful love song and a great vocal performance pairing these two singers. Your All I Need to get By is another romantic song that I really liked.Motown 2 is such a treat to listen to. Michael McDonald really captures the spirit of these Motown classics so well.

The life of Jeannette Walls should inspire everyone who reads The Glass Castle. It is a very moving memoir about it feels likes to be poor. Living with a father who suffered with the disease of alcoholism made her childhood tense and scary, and I think Walls describes this well. She writes very openly about asking her father to stop drinking and to find a steady job to support the family. I think Walls also presents her father as a loving supportive person when he was sober. Walls also urged her mother who dreamed of becoming an artist to get a job teaching to help their family out. I enjoyed reading about the examples in the book that showed her father as a good man. He bought new bicycles for his children and took them to the zoo. He also developed a love of learning in his children. Wells writes very vividly about what it felt like sleeping in cardboard boxes, looking though trash cans and dumpsters for food and eating nothing but popcorn for many days. She also lived in a house with no electricity or indoor plumbing. She developed a sense of resourcefulness of being so poor. She made her own set of braces to straighten out of coat hangers and rubber bands. She also took a job at the age of 13 at a jewerly store to help make ends meet. Wells discovers a love of journalism in high school which became one of the turning points in her life. Her love of writing led to a career as a journalist in New York City. Jeannette Walls has worked hard to achieve the life she now has. The Glass Castle is a touching, inspirational, entertaining memoir of a courageous successful woman.

I absolutely loved reading this book. It is filled with excellent speeches, poems, stories, and songs. This book is divided into interesting sections like The Flag, Equality, Freedom, War and Peace, and The Individual. There are excerpts from famous books included here like To Kill A Mockingbird, The Grapes of Wrath, and Huckleberry Finn. Just reading these excerpts made me take a few of these books off my shelf again.One of my favorite speeches in this book is entitled Can A Woman Ever Be President of the United States. It was given in 1935 by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. She talked in the speech about why she felt a woman would make a good President and the qualities that would make a woman a good leader. In the speech Roosevelt believed that women are more capable of attending to detail and better at adjusting to different surroundings than men. There is a wonderful speech given by Hillary Rodham Clinton in Beijing China about inequality and the physical and psychological violations women in China endure This is a very powerful speech that urges a need for change and a willingness for all people to work together so that every woman can reach their full potential in life. I also loved Teddy Roosevelt's 1899 speech called The Strenuous Life in which he told the American people to work hard and not be afraid to endure hardship in order to make their dreams come true. Martin Luther's I Have a Dream speech about racial equality and social justice from 1963 is included in this book. I appreciated reading this speech, because I never heard the entire speech before or understood the significance until now.I loved the story of Senator John McCain who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He remained hopeful and optimistic of his release sinply by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance everyday. I loved the statement Edward Kennedy gave in support of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, because as a disabled person I can appreciate how much progress our country has made in leveling the playing field with persons for disabilities in all areas of life.I loved the speech by Arnold Schwarzengger entitled The Education Of An American as he talked about how he became a successful movie star. Arnold now has a new mission in life promoting fitness and sports programs in schools.There are lyrics of popular songs like Born In The USA, Surfing USA and God Bless the USA which all celebrate a sense of pride in the United States. There are other songs like Big Yellow Taxi and Blowing in the Wind. These songs are about how fast change takes place in this country.There are many descriptive and insightful poems in this book. One of my favorites is Let America Be America Again by Langston Hughes. It is a wonderful poem about the dream of racial equality in America. The Road Not Taken is a great poem by Robert Frost about following your own path in life.This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning more about American history or culture. I enjoyed it very much.

I love the music of Tony Bennett on this CD. I love the romantic tracks The Very Thought Of You with Paul McCartney. The Shadow of Your Smile is beautifully subtle and romantic. Smile is a pretty duet with a hint of sadness to it. Billy Joel sounds so wise and reflective on the track The Good Life. It is good to hear Billy sing again. I love the duet How Do You Keep The Music Playing. The duet with George Michael has a sad but lovely quality to it. This CD also contains fun upbeat songs like Lullaby On Broadway and Are You Having Any Fun. I love the big band sound on these tracks For Once In My Life is touching duet with Stevie Wonder. The piano playing by Lee Muskier is so good here. The Best Is Yet To Come is a jazzy duet with Diana Krall. Tony's signature hit song I Left My Heart In San Franciso is always smooth and enjoyable. This is an excellent duet CD filled with classic songs.

Beyonce sounds great on her second solo disc B Day. The title is a reference to her 25th birthday this month. My favorite track are Deja Vu and Get Me Bodied. These first two songs really get my body moving. I like Jay Z's rap vocals on Deja Vu very much. Suga Mama is a groovy sounding track about a sweet person. Upgrade U is a song about a girl looking for a new boyfriend, because her old one constantly disrespects her. I think a lot of women can relate to the lyrics of this song. The track Ring the Alarm is another hit on this disc. This song is about a person who refuses to be taken advantage of. This song is very upbeat. I like it, even though I don't understand all the words. Irreplaceable is a good song about how people can sometimes become attached to their possessions. Freakum Dress is a track about how a beautiful dress can get a man's attention instantly. This song makes me want to party and find a pretty woman of my own. Resentment is a pretty song about how hard it can be move on after a bad relationship. I love this new CD.

Genius Loves Company is an excellent album. Ray Charles performs 12 unforgettable duets with artists old and new. The result is the best album of the year so far. This CD will appeal to a lot of listeners, because each song is performed in a different musical style.Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of my favorite songs of all time. Ray performs a very pretty version of this song with the great Johnny Mathis. These two legendary voices sound so good together. I loved Ray's duet Sweet Potato Pie with James Taylor They sound like they are having so much fun singing this lively song. Do I Ever Cross Your Mind is a very romantic duet Ray sings with Bonnie Raitt. I love her slow subtle voice paired with Ray Charles very much. Amother highlight on Genius Loves Company is the beautiful but sad duet Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word with Elton John. Ray sings a wonderful song entitled Here We Go Again with Norah Jones. Her smooth pleasant voice sounds so good with Ray Charles here. Sinners Prayer is an excellent blues duet I forgot how well BB King could sing, because I'm only famillar with his work as a guitar player.I enjoyed the song Hey Girl very much. I grew up listening to Michael McDonald's voice in the 70s and 80's. I am glad he was included on this album. I haven't heard from him in years. Hey Girl is a very nice duet. It Was A Very Good Year is a very semtimental duet with country legend Willie Nelson. I really enjoyed this song. I had so much fun listening to Genius Loves Company. This album is Ray Charles at his best!

Amos Lee's self titled debut album is so good. He plays the acoustic guitar like it is an extension of his voice. Both are soothing, soulful, and uplifting. I loved all the tracks on this CD, because I think his voice and lyrics in his songs are very moving.My favorite track is Arms of A Woman. It is a beautiful love song about what it feels like to be in love with a woman. This feeling stays with you long after she is gone. I can listen to this track over and over because it is pretty. Keep it Loose, Keep it Tight is a song about trying to stay true to yourself while searching for what makes you happy. Black River is a great song that makes you forget all your problems. This song really puts your mind at ease. Some of these tracks sound like something you would hear during a jam session just playing and having fun especially the song Give it Up. This song has a lively beat that will get your feet tapping. All My Friends is the best friendship song I've heard in years. It is a song about the influence friends can have on you. Bottom of The Barrel is a song that reminds us that we can overcome any hardship in life and rise. It is a very optimistic song about never giving up. I enjoyed this CD very much.

Diana Krall is one of the best jazz vocalists around today. This CD features her performing Christmas standards. I love the big band sound that the orchestra provides on this album. There are fun groovy sounding standards like Jingle Bells and Let It Snow. I never thought that Christmas music could be romantic, but that is the feeling Krall creates on the track I'll Be Home For Christmas. Winter Wonderland has a very sensual sound. I loved the smooth bass guitar on this track. Her rendition of White Christmas is absolutely lovely. There is such a romantic sentiment to this song. The Christmas Song is another highlight on this album. It is a song about enjoying the simple things in life like spending time with family and listening to Christmas carols. Santa Claus is Coming To Town is another highlight on this CD. Krall really communicates a feeling of excitement and anticipation with her vocals on this track. Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. It is a song that I am not famillar with, but I love the message of the song of being thankful for all of your many blessings in life. Diana's piano playing and vocals on the track Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas are so relaxing. I really enjoyed this song. I loved listening this CD.

This is an excellent soundtrack to the new animated movie Curious George. My favorite track is the first single Upside Down. This is a song about we should always have a curious approach about life and make our own discoveries.Jungle Gym is another catchy tune here. This is a very playful song that fits the spirit of the movie well. This is a song that is easy to sing along to especially when Johnson sings the la la chorus of this song. I love the duet with my own two hands with Ben Harper here. It is a pretty song about reaching out to make a friend.The 3 R's is another highlight here. This is a cute song about how everything we find is useful, and that we should not waste anything. I think the track The Sharing Stone is a very groovy sounding song. I enjoyed the piano playing by Zach Gill on this track, and I think he compliments Jack Johnson's vocals here well. Jack Johnson is truly a talented musician. I love this soundtrack, and I can't wait to see the movie.

I loved all the tracks on this CD. The first track entitled Real Gone by Sheryl Crow is an energetic rock song with a nice beat. This song is about what it feels like to be young and free. Brad Paisley contributes a very pretty song here entitled Find Yourself. It is a beautiful song about trying to fit into a new environment and making new friends. Life Is A Highway is a good song about looking for adventure on the open road. There are two good versions of Route 66 here. I love the classic version by Chuck Berry. The new version by John Mayer is equally enjoyable. James Taylor performs a very pretty song entitled Our Town here. This song is very touching. My Heart Would Know is a very relaxing laid back country song by Hank Williams Jr. Sh Boom is just a very fun cute song. Randy Newman provides an excellent musical score. He really conveys the spirit of the movie in these instrumental tracks. I could feel the excitement and the tension of cars racing in the tracks entitled Opening Race and The Big Race. McQueen and Sally is another one of my favorite instrumental tracks. It conveys the spirit of friendship so well. This is a CD that the whole family will enjoy.

This is an excellent album by Wynonna. My favorite song is her hit song of the Foreigner classic I Want To Know What Love Is. Wynonna has such a sexy voice, and I think she performs this song so well. Burning Love is another favorite track of mine on this album. This song was featured in the animated movie Lilo and Stitch a few years back. Wynonna sings this song with such energy and spirit. I loved it.I also enjoyed Wynonna's duet Flies On The Butter with her mother Naomi. It is a song about childhood and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. I loved the images in this song of running through a sprinkler in your underwear or taking a nap on your grandfather's lap.What the World Needs is a great song about having compassion for people less fortunate than ourselves. I think this is song is about realizing that we all struggle through life at some point. Wynonna sounds so good on the song Sometimes I Feel Like Elvis. It is song about being rich and famous and yet feeling so empty and lonely. Wynonna sings this song with so much emotion and power.It All Comes Down to Love is another hit song on the album. I loved this song, because it is very upbeat and positive. This song is about how all the distractions in society and media can sometimes make us feel sad and lost. This song reminds us that the only thing important in life is that we love ourselves and not to worry about the things going around us. What The World Needs Now is an excellent album by Wynonna. She has such a rich and sexy voice. I really enjoyed listening to it.

The music on this soundtrack is so fun. "Good Morning Baltimore" is an optimistic and happy song performed by Nikki Blonsky. "I Hear The Bells" shows her vocal range as a singer. Blonsky is the highlight of this soundtrack, but there are so many other excellent track. "Run And Tell That" is an upbeat track performed by Elijah Kelley. This song is a crowd pleaser for sure. Queen Latifah sounds so soulful and cool on the tracks "I Know Where I've Been" and "Big, Blond and Beautiful". "Ladies Choice" is a song that gets me moving out of my seat. Zac Efron sounds great vocally on this song. He also sounds good on this track "Without Love." It is a sweet love song. "Cooties" is a sexy sounding song performed by Aimee Allen. Christopher Walken and John Travolta really surprised me on the track "You're Timeless To Me" This is a sentimentally funny song. Mama, I'm A Big Girl Now is a cute song featuring Rikki Lake. I enjoyed listening to all the tracks on this soundtrack.

Jill Scott is a very talented singer and songwriter. Beautifully Human is an excellent album. The best song is the first single Golden. It is a great song about embracing your freedom and living life to the fullest. Family reunion is another highlight for me on this album. This song makes me think of my own family and how I enjoy their company and good food. Jill sounds soulful and very nostalgic on this track, and I loved it. The other standout track is Bedda at Home. This song is about resisting temptation from other men and staying faithful to your partner. Bedda at Home is definitely one of those songs that gets your body moving. I really enjoyed it. Can't Explain is a very smooth and pretty song about not being able to explain why a person was not faithful to their partner. I love these two songs, and I enjoyed listening to their opposite messages. Cross your Mind is another favorite song of mine. thinking about an ex boyfriend and remembering the good and bad things about the relationship. My Petition is a song about the difficulty people some have in a relationship with. trusting each other Jill sounds very melodic and sensual on this track. Her phrasing is so crisp and clear. I could really relate to the lyrics of most of these songs, because they talk about different aspects of being in love. I really enjoyed listening to Beautifully Human, and I highly recommend it.

5th Gear is an excellent new CD from Brad Paisley. Brad has always been very perceptive about life and relationships. I like the way he turns his perceptions into songs. "Online" is my favorite track. This is a very funny song about how a person can have an online life and a very different real life. "I'm Still A Guy" is another good song about how a man's personality doesn't change when he is in a relationship There is a lot of truth in this song, and that is why I like it so much. "All I Wanted Was A Car" is a very true song about how a car is the most important thing to a young man in high school. "Some Mistakes" is a song about how some mistakes in life can be fun. I like Brad's fun vocals on this track. "Oh Love" is a very pretty duet with Carrie Underwood. I really how their voices blend together. "Letter To Me" is an excellent song for any person who feels depressed about being dumped. This is a very hopeful song, and I like it very much. "Mr. Policeman" and "Throttleneck" are two up tempo songs that show Brad's talent on the guitar. This is a very enjoyable new CD by Brad Paisley.

I love animals, and I enjoyed reading this book about them. Training exotic animals like foxes, wolves and even camels can be very dangerous. Students who want to become trainers through this gruelling 22 month program located in Ventura California have to memorize every species of every animal. They also have to learn all about animal anatomy and ethics. The program is also very strict on attendance. Students can be penalized if they are not on time for class every day. The penalty for lateness is not being able to work with the animal they want to.I learned that animal trainers can be found on television and movie sets, animals parks and zoos, and research sites all over the country. Students in this program also have to take classes on animal ethics and animal anatomy. I loved reading about all the things that animals can be trained to do. For example, a hyena can be trained to dance. A camel can also be trained to dunk a basketball. A simple task like training a horse to pull a cart can take a year especially if the horse is overweight. I learned that an aging sea lion can develop a medical condition like epilepsy. An elephant can be taught to hold their foot up if their nails need to be trimmed. A llama must be trained to stand still in order to be brushed.I learned the names of animals I never even heard of like the kinkajou. The kinkajou is a honey bear that has the tendency to bite people. I also learned that a mandrill is a constantly jumping baboon that can be taught to stay still in order to receive an injection. I learned that a caracal is an African wildcat. This is a very informative and entertaining book about animals. I just wish it included some pictures of the animals. Overall, though, I enjoyed this book very much.

I really enjoyed listening to Brad Paisley's Time Well Wasted. My favorite track is the first single Alcohol. This is a great song about the positive and negative aspects of drinking alcohol. Brad is very perceptive as he sings how alcohol can improve your confidence and creativity, but it can also destroy your life and relationships. The musicians playing on this song are excellent I loved the fiddle playing by Stuart Duncan and the piano playing by Jim Moose Brown. As much as I love this song, there are other great tracks like The World. This is a very upbeat love song about much Brad loves his wife. To everybody else in the world, she is just another person or customer. However, in his eyes, his wife means everything to him. Waitin on a Woman is another song inspired by his wife. This is a very good song about how women might make a man wait a long time for everyone, but she is worth it. The violin and steel guitar are played beautifully here. The title track is an excellent song about how time wasted by being in the company of a good friend doing nothing important can be very special.Out in the Parking Lot is one of my favorite songs on this album too. This is a great song about all the things you might see in a parking lot like a fight taking place or a band playing music. Brad Paisley and Alan Jackson are two of the best singers in country music and they sound great together. The steel guitar playing on this track gives this song a fun country sound. Brad teams up with country legend Dolly Parton on the duet When I Get Where I'm Going It is a spiritual song about how happy a person can be when they get to heaven to see their love ones again. I think the acoustic guitar gives this track a pretty traditional country sound, and I loved it.Time Warp is a spirited instrumental track that showcases the musicians together simply having fun playing their instruments. I really like this track. Time Well Wasted is one of the best country albums of the year. Brad Paisley is a talented songwriter and singer. He puts his own personal insight in these songs, and he sounds flawless in performing them.

I really enjoyed listening to this new album by Eric Clapton.He recently got married again, and he now has 3 young children. Most of the tracks on this album are about how much he loves being a new father and husband. The song Run Home To Me is about how much he enjoys spending time with his family and watching his kids play. He sings about his lack of sleep and how much he relies on his wife on the track So Tired. These lyrics are so true, because as every new parent knows babies require constant attention. Say What You Will is another highlight on this CD. This is a sweet song is about the friendship, support, and love Eric receives from his wife. I also enjoyed Eric's cover of the George Harrison's song Love Comes To Everyone. I love the instruments playing on this track especially the keyboard and dobro steel guitar. Love Don't Love Nobody is a cover of an old Spinners song about how loving someone is never simple and easy. This is a fairly long song at over 7 minutes, but I loved it, because Eric's vocals are so moving and honest.I'm Going Left is a song that really got me moving. I love the energy in Eric's spirited vocals. It sounds like all the musicians are performing on this track. Revolution is a track with a nice regaae sound with the horns playing on it. Lost and Found is a song that features Clapton jamming on his guitar. This song has a hard blues edge that is very enjoyable to listen to. This album does not say which musicians perform on what track, but I could detect Steve Winwood on the keyboard and John Mayer playing guitar in the background. I loved listening to Back Home. It is great to see Eric Clapton back on the music scene.

Three Cups of Tea is about Greg Mortensen's dedication to improve the lives of Pakistani and Afghan people. He has built thousands of schools for girls, provided communities of people with water, and built vocational centers for women. He is an intelligent man who learned to speak three different Pakistani languages fluently in ten years. I liked how he blended into the culture by learning how to pray and how to enjoy drinking tea with people. This book describes the constant violence between the people of India and Pakistan. I am amazed by how much Mortensen has accomplished despite all that violence. This book also describes the danger in Afghanistan with all the drug smuggling and land mines. The geography of Pakistan sounnds fascinating with the mountains like K2 and Gasherbrum. I knew nothing about the culture and geography of Pakistan, so I found this book very entertaining and insightful.

The Light in the Piazza is the story about how about the lives of a mother and daughter from America are transformed while on vacation in Italy during the summer of 1953. Adam Guettel's musical compositions are simply lovely The collective performance of an orchestra that includes violins, cello, harp and guitar really add to the romance of the story.The daughter, Clara, is played by Kelli O' Hara. She falls in love with a young Italian man named Fabrizio played by Matthew Morrison. Their relationship faces opposition from members of their respective families. I think the elements of love and opposition is what makes this musical so entertaining.The first track is the overture which sets a tone of romance and adventure. Say It Somehow is a very pretty duet performed by the two romantic leads. Kelli O' Hara stands out here with her incredible voice. She hits all the high notes beautifully on this track. Matthew Morrison shines on the track Il Mondo Era Vuoto. Italian is a beautiful language and he shows that on this track. Another great musical number is Dividing Day performed by Victoria Clark who plays Clara's mother Margaret. In this song, Margaret wonders how and why the spark in her own marriage died out. She sings a pretty duet with Mark Harelik who plays Fabrizio's father entitled Let's Walk. This song is about a friendship can turn into love. Octet is another highlight track that features all eight performers in the cast. All of their voices harmonize so well on this song. Victoria Clark closes the show with the beautiful finale entitled Fable in which she sings about how her opinion of love and life has changed over the course of her vacation. Her voice conveys so much insight and emotion. I really enjoyed all the tracks on this album.

I really enjoyed listening to this new CD from Pearl Jam. The themes on this album like suicide, loss and alienation are things that many bands do not address enough, and I really admire Pearl Jam for including songs like this on their latest CD. My favorite track is Life Wasted. I had to listen to it several times before I understood what it meant. This tune is about how precious life is. Mike McCready gives this song an energetic pulsating beat on the guitar that compliments Eddie Vedder's vocals so well. World Wide Suicide is another fast hard track. This is a song about it feels likes to have a sense of hopelessness about life. Comatose is a short fearless fast track highlighted by drummer Matt Cameron's awesome drum beat. Unemployable is another highlight track. This song is about the pressure a man feels being unemployed and trying to support his family. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics of this song. Come Back is another gem on this disc. This song is about losing someone close to you and wishing that they would come back. Eddie sings this song with such feeling. Gone is another good song about losing faith in the American dream. Eddie has a such a deep sexy voice, and he sounds great here. I enjoyed this CD very much.

The School of Rock is a very funny movie. Jack Black is wonderful as Dewey Finn, a person posing as an elementary school teacher after he is kicked out of a rock band. I loved how Jack Black helps the kids in his class bring out their musical talents. He makes a class of 5th graders feel good about themselves through music. I was impressed by how talented the kids in the movie are especially the guitar player Zach. Joan Cusack is perfectly cast as the strict principal. One of my favorite scenes is when she cuts loose and starts singing in the restaurant. This movie has great music too. I loved all songs performed by the band. I also liked the classic rock songs by Led Zeppelin and Cream. There is a very good music video at the end of the movie too. Another fun extra feature is Dewey Finn blackboard lesson on the history of rock music. The School Of Rock is a DVD the whole family can enjoy!

The Devil In The White City is a very interesting book. I knew nothing about the World Fair in Chicago in 1893, so I can honestly say I learned a lot. I found this to be a very entertaining book too. This book is about two real life characters. The first character is an ambitious architect named Daniel Burnham who had a dream to create the world's greatest visual spectacle. The other main character is a young doctor named H.H. Holmes. who had the ability to charm any woman. Holmes operated a drugstore, a retail store, and a hotel. However, under Holmes' facade as a hard working citizen, he was a ruthless murderer who killed scores of women, men, and children.The World Fair of 1893 lasted just 6 months but had over 27 million visitors when the country's population was only 65 million people at the time. It attracted people of great influence like Susan B. Anthony who fought for the equality of women in voting and labor rights. The fair also drew inventors like Thomas Edison and entertainers like Buffalo Bill. It is really amazing to read how Burnham and his partners spent 3 years and transformed a swampy park into a fair that filled over 200 buildings. During the duration of the fair, the hospital treated 11,602 people, 64 people a day for the injuries and ailments caused by the fair like headaches, fainting, diarrhea, foreign objects in the eye.The Fair of 1893 in Chicago also introduced the world to many inventions like the incandescent light bulb, the automatic dishwasher, the zipper, moving pictures, shredded wheat cereal, and the main attraction of the fair called the Ferris Wheel. It also introduced a device that made plates for printing books in Braille. The World Fair made a powerful impression on the Disney family, because Elias Disney helped build the White City which was the name for the fair. His son Walt Disney was inspired many years to create Disneyland as a result.The Devil in the White City is a very enjoyable book. The characters are well researched, and the setting of the fair is so vivid.

I love this new CD from Michael Buble. My favorite track is "Everything". It is a very upbeat and romantic song. "The Best is Yet to Come" is such a fun optimistic song. All of the instruments compliment Michael's vocals well on this song. "Me and Mrs Jones" is another standout track. Michael's vocals on this song are very smooth and enjoyable. I love his rendition of this classic song. "Lost" is a sad song. It has a beautiful tone though, and I really like it. "Comin' Home Baby" is an uptempo track. Boyz II Men lend their vocal talents on this track. This track sounds so groovy. "Always On My Mind" is another excellent track. The piano playing by David Foster is very pretty here. "It Had Better Be Tonight" is an up tempo high energy track that makes me get up and dance. The music on this CD is very entertaining. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves music.

This book is for everyone who has felt discouraged, overwhelmed, embarassed, saddened and confused. The experiences of the contributors in this book are so diverse as our the contributors themselves. They are comprised of actors, CEOs of major companies, movie directors, talk show hosts, musicians, athletes, activists, journalists, artists and politicians. These are some of the stories, people, and words that stood out for me.Former New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani who learned that life is a combination of great tragedy and great beauty from a woman who lost her father, husband, and son all in one year. He learned to celebrate the beauty and the positive things in life. Oprah Winfrey was inspired by the words of a producer who said just be yourself when she felt overwhelmed starting out as a talk show host years ago. Her main compettion was Phil Donahue who was the king of talk shows at the time. The same idea motivated Marlo Thomas when she was started out as an actress. Her legendary father advised her to run her own race. Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.com learned an important lesson by listening to the words of his grandfather. It is much harder to be nice than clever. I thought those words as like so many in this book to be profound. Actress Jennifer Aniston was inspired by a speech written by Marianne Williamson given by Nelson Mandella. The gist of the speech is that we all have a light or gift within us that we all need to share. Journalist Ted Koppel took the words of Roy Rogers to heart when he read that everyone is ignorant just on different subjects. Steven Spielberg was inspired by the words of a Davy Crockett movie The words Be sure you're right, then go ahead gave him the confidence to drop out of college and become a director.Some of the most interesting insights come from people who are not as famous. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a historian who worked with President Johnson writing his memoir was inspired by the words of psychologist Erik Erikson that the richest lives attain an inner balance comprised of work, play and love. Erikson concluded that we should not sacrifice one need to pursue another. The contribution by Dr. David Ho is interesting to me because of what he does for a living. David Ho is the director of AIDS research and through his efforts with different drugs patients live longer and healthier lives. Patients focus on living and not dying because of him. I enjoyed the wisdom in the story of political advisor Mary Matalin who learned from her father that confidence is what separates successful people from unsuccessful ones. Confidence is created from 3 things being prepared, having experience, and never giving up. This is an idea I will never forget.There are some cliches in this book, but they are interesting because of the people who were motivated by them achieved great things. Astronaunt Sally Ride was inspired by the words reach for the stars and became the first woman in space. Toni Morrison was motivated by the words anything worth doing is worth doing well. Morrison won the Nobel Prize for her novel Song of Solomon later in life. Designer Ralph Lauren was inspired by the music of Frank Sinatra and the song My Way.The Right Words at the Right Time is an excellent book filled with pearls of wisdom. This book has wonderful insights about life, work, character and love.

I really enjoyed listening to this new CD by Rascal Flatts. Stand is my favorite song on this album. It is a song with a very positive message that you can overcome hard times if you stay focused and don't give up. The title track is a fun upbeat track about hanging out with your gang of friends having fun. What Hurts The Most is another gem here. This is an excellent song about the pain of breaking up with someone, and the difficulty of expressing your feelings to that person. I could really relate to the lyrics of this song. Cool Thing is another highlight track here. This song is about how two people find each other and fall in love. This song is also about how it feels when the person you love leaves you. I love Gary LeVox's emotional vocals on this song. Ellsworth is a very touching song about a grandmother suffering from Alzheimers disease and how a special place conjures up memories of long ago. I love the lyrics of My Wish. This is a beautiful song about all of the good wishes of love and prosperity you could have for someone you love. Me and My Gang is a very entertaining CD. I enjoyed it very much.

This is a great new CD from Mary Chapin Carpenter. The Calling is a wonderful first track about how everyone discovers their purpose in life at different stages. My favorite track is the upbeat track We're All Right. This is a fun song about living life footloose and fancy free. It Must Have Happened is another upbeat song about how a person changes over time. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics of this song Twilight is a slower paced track about the beauty of twilight and nature. Mary's phrasing on this track is very pretty. Houston is a lovely song about how people sometimes dream about having a better life in a new place. The piano playing is lovely on this track. On With This Song is Mary's patriotic tribute to the men and women who serve their country in the military. I like this track a lot. Here I Am is a standout track about friendship. The guitar playing and Mary's vocals are very moving here. Why Shouldn't We is another gem about keeping a sense of hope and faith in life. I really enjoyed the songs by Mary Chapin Carpenter on this album.

This is a very good CD. Vanessa Carlton has a beautiful voice and is a talented piano player. The best song on this CD is the upbeat A Thousand Miles, but there are several others just as excellent. Ordinary Day has the same soaring quality of A Thousand Miles. It reminds us to make the most of every day, and that we have the ability to make our dreams come true. I love Vanessa's rendition of the Rolling Stones song Paint it Black. It is a very energetic song with a great drum beat.Not every song on this CD is as happy the first few. Nevertheless, I found the lyrics to be very thoughtful. Rinse is about the inability of trying to cleanse yourself of someone who is destroying your self image. Twilight is a song about learning to appreciate our life from someone whose life is near the twilight or the end. The main message of this song is that we should never take life for granted. Be Not Nobody has variety of themes and moods on it. I enjoyed it very much.

This is a classic album from Mike. I love every track especially "Wanna Be Startin Somethin", "The Lady In My Life" and "Billie Jean". The romantic "Human Nature" stands out for me too. This is a perfect album from beginning to end, and it brings back a lot of memories for me. I love the new remixes on this disc. I love the "Beat It" remix by Fergie. It sounds tough and gritty. I also love "The Girl is Mine" remix too. This is Michael Jackson at his best.

I was a fan of Chris Daughtry when he was on American Idol, so I had to pick up this album. I really enjoyed listening to this CD. He has a very strong gut wrenching voice. I love this song It's Not Over. This is a good song about trying to hang on and save a relationship. My favorite track is Home. This is a very personal song. It is about how he loves being a rock but misses being at home. I also love the track What I Want. Daughtry's vocals and Slash's guitar are a perfect match on this excellent fast paced song. There And Back Again is another energetic track that I enjoyed. Feels like Tonight is about a person trying to mend a relationship. All These Lives is a sad song. This song is about how short life really is, and it is also about how so many young people never realize their potential. Chris Daughtry is a very talented artist with a bright future.

I don't remember all the movies these Van Morrison songs were featured in, but I love Van's music I didn't even see the movie Clean and Sober, but I recognized the great song Domino instantly. My favorite track on this CD is Brown Eyed Girl. It was featured in the film Born On the Fourth Of July. I also enjoyed the fun track Wild Night. This song was featured in the female buddy film Thelma and Louise. I love the track Moondance. It sounds so groovy. I did not know it was featured in the movie An American Werewolf In London though. I feel like renting the movie just to see how the song was used. The classic hit Gloria is another favorite of mine. This song was featured in the movie The Outsiders. Van sings this song with a lot of spirit and energy. Have I Told You Lately is a very pretty song. It was featured in the recent flick One Fine Day. I enjoyed the music on this CD very much.

This is an excellent CD from the Dixie Chicks. I think so many people will relate to the subject matter on this album. Their fan base will definitely increase with this album. My favorite is the title track. It is a great song about following your own path in life. This song is also about doing what you feel is best for you. The girls sound great together here. I Like It is a simple song about enjoying life to the fullest. I Hope is a standout track featuring on the guitar on this track. He gives this track a cool smooth tone with his expert guitar playing. Lubbock or Leave it is a very upbeat song. I loved all the instruments featured on this track especially the banjo and violin. Lullaby and Easy Silence are two beautiful songs about the love a parent feels for their child. The Bitter End is a pretty song about lifelong friendship. Not Ready to Make Nice is a song about someone who is mad about getting hurt in a relationship. I love the feisty spirit of this track very much. Silent House is a beautiful but sad song about remembering the happiness a person brought to your life after they have died. Taking The Long Way is one of the best country albums of 2006. I loved all these songs.

What Should I Do With my Life is an interesting book about the various paths people have taken with their lives. I was impressed by the courage and accomplishments of almost every person in this book. I loved the story of Leela DeSouza who had a passion for ballet dancing. She also worked as a top runway model in her spare time. However, she was not content until she went to college. She attended the University of Chicago and Stanford business school. This led her to a White House fellowship and her current job at a high tech public relations firm. It was very interesting to read how people in one profession switched to another one entirely different. I enjoyed the story of Kurt Slauson who studied to be an English professor until his older brother committed suicide. He rediscovered a passion for cooking and went to culinary school to become a chef. I loved the determination of the British chemistry professor who became a lawyer at the age of 70. He was turned down for employment because of his age, but he remained undaunted to achieve his dream. I enjoyed the story of the Harvard Business graduate. This young man turned his back on the family business and had the courage to change his career path and his lifestyle. He eventually became a police officer in the rough section of El Monte California. I loved the story of Janelle London who who switched from being a lawyer to an organ donation activist after her kidney transplant failed. What Should I Do With My Life is a very entertaining and insightful book.

This is a very good soundtrack. All of these songs are excellent. I loved the classic song Space Oddity by David Bowie. The great Pete Townsend song Let My Love Open the Door is featured here. The song I've Seen All Good People by Yes is just one of those great 70's anthem like songs that brings people together.The new songs on this soundtrack are pretty good too. Where are You Going by Dave Mathews is an elegantly subtle song. Sweetest thing by U2 is a very pretty song that fits the theme of the movie well. Another good song on this CD in my opinion is the light and breezy Island in the Sun by Wheezer. I also enjoyed the lively new song by the Counting Crows.This is an enhanced CD with interactive games on it. I enjoyed playing the catching the cat game in which you have to rescue cats falling from a building. I also liked playing the typing game on this CD. Your typing speed is tested in this game. The faster you can type out words the more chances you have of hitting an animated foot. This game is very challenging and fun. This CD even includes the trailer to the movie itself.

This is a well written well researched book that I enjoyed very much. I loved reading about the geography, geology, history, and legacy of the world's most destructive volcano. The creation of the news agency Reuters and the telegraph machine with the advent of Morse Code helped the spread the news of this disaster to the world within moments of the eruption in 1883. I also learned that the Dutch enslaved the people of Java for over two centuries. The rebellion by the Indonesians against the Dutch was ignited by the eruption of Krakatoa and is detailed well in this book. Indonesia now has the largest population of people of Islamic faith in the world because of Dutch rule. Winchester does an excellent job of describing the devastation Krakatoa caused as more than 35,000 people died mostly as the result of the 60 mile a hour tidal waves the eruption caused.The cause of the eruption of Krakatoa in the book is very complex. It is a process called subduction in which a heavier and colder tectonic plate collides with a lighter warmer one. There are many helpful drawings and captions to describe the technical geological concepts. Winchester even rates volcanos with an explosivity index which is based on the amount of material ejected in an eruption and the height the material reaches in the air. I found these concepts about volcanos to be very interesting.There is a lot of information in this book, and it should be read slowly to understand and appreciate it. If you like to read books about history and earth science, or geography you will enjoy this book.

I love this new CD from KT. Drastic Fantastic is a catchy title too. Every track sounds different in tempo, melody and theme. My favorite track is the upbeat "Little Favours". I also love the pop tune "I Don't Want You Now". This songs have very energetic. "Hold On" is a track that gets me out of my seat too. These cuts are the best. "Paper Aeroplane" is a very soothing and melodic track. The flute playing is beautiful here. "Hopeless" is a track I can see myself singing in the car with my buddies. I like the mandolin playing on the track "Funny Man". "Saving My Face" is a great song about feeling trapped by life. I love the variety of songs on this disc. I'll recommend it to all my friends.

The hymns of the 49th Parallel is an excellent album filled with cover songs by Canadian singers whose music I am not famillar with like Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and Leonard Cohen, but that did not matter to me. They are excellent song writers and KD Lang is such a wonderful singer. I love anything she puts out. The first track After the Gold Rush is very soothing. I really liked this song. I could visualize all the images KD sings about. This CD does have a few songs religious themes to it. I am not a religious person, but I enjoyed them. One of my favorite song is The Valley. It is a religious song that reminds us that death is a part of life. It sounds very much like a church hymn, and KD sings it beautifully. The song Jericho is a great song about how difficult it can be to keep and maintain a friendship.Bird on The Wire is a great song about trying to be honest and true to yourself and the people you love. I loved the lyrics to the song A Case of You. It is a very romantic song about loving someone so much they become so much a part of you. Helpless is an excellent song about feeling lost and yearning some peace. KD makes references in these two songs to her native Canada as the place where she finds happiness and a sense of comfort.The hymns of the 49th Parallel is a very enjoyable collection of cover songs. The lyrics of this songs are so good. KD sings all these songs with her powerful voice that conveys such warmth and wisdom. I loved listening to this CD.

This is a wonderful new book by Amy Tan. I was intrigued just by the title. The bonesetter is a doctor who creates powders and potions using dragon bones to heal ailments. I love reading about Chinese women too. This is the reason I bought this book. Luling is a strong woman who raises her daughter Ruth by herself after outliving 2 husbands. Luling is the daughter of a mute nursemaid whose identity is unknown to Luling until after her death. I loved reading about how Luling grew up in an orphange. She finds love and a vocation in the orphange. This is probably the most touching part of the book. Ruth Young is a ghostwriter who takes on the responsibility for her mother's care after she develops Alzheimers disease while juggling her career and other demands. This is a very enjoyable book.

The Known World is the best novel of historical fiction I have ever read. Edward P. Jones gives each character in this novel such a distinct personality. Upon finishing this novel, I felt I knew and understood why each character did the things they did. I learned from reading this novel that many black people owned slaves and had sexual relations with them.I also learned that slaves were often very skilled in the trades they picked up. There is a character named Augustus Townsend in the novel who is a talented furniture and walking stick maker. His son is a character named Henry who becomes an overseer of all of the slaves belonging to his white master. He later becomes skilled shoe maker and builds his own house.Slaves naturally attempt to run away from a life of oppression, and Jones shows what happens when their attempts are successful and not successful. In a successful attempt, a runaway slave named Rita survives for 41 hours in a wooden box on a boat from Virgina bound for New York. A slave named Elias makes an unsuccessful attempt to run away and gets part of his ear cut off.The author also shows that slaves had a fierce loyalty to their masters. There is one very moving part in the novel where a slave named Celeste works in the field while pregnant and suffers a miscarriage. I loved the example of Ralph who stayed with his master Clara for a few years after he received his freedom and remained her friend.The Known World is a very entertaining novel. Each character is so well developed The novel is a reminder of how precious our freedom really is. I loved this novel.

Moonlight Serenade is a CD filled with love song standards. I did not know that the title track is the theme of the Glenn Miller Band. I've only heard this song performed in an instrumental style before. Carly performs this song with lyrics, and it sounds so romantic. It is definitely one of the highlights on this album. Another standout track is I Only Have Eyes For You. The saxophone playing on this song gives it a sophisticated romantic quality. Carly looks great in the video for this song too. I also really enjoyed the song I've Got You Under My Skin. This song was originally written by Cole Porter and later recorded by Frank Sinatra. Carly's version of this tune sounds so pretty especially with the saxophone playing by Tom Evans. He again compliments her vocals so well. Where or When is a perfect song to slow dance to with someone you love. The piano playing by Jim Cox on this track gives this tune a very romantic touch. My One and Only Love is a song about being completely devoted to someone. The harmonica playing on this song gives this track a sweet and tender quality that I loved. I enjoyed watching the DVD in which Carly explains why she chose these songs to be on this album. It is great to see her reunited with producer Richard Perry on this project. He worked with Carly in the early 70's turning her songs into records. He is successful here again by arranging such talented musicians to perform on this album. I recommend Moonlight Serenade to anyone who enjoys listening to classic love songs.

This is an excellent family film. If you like kung fu movies or comedies, Kung Fu Panda is the movie for you. This film features good voice work from Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is beautiful. I love the extra features included on this DVD. There is a feature called Dragon Warrior Academy. This is a series of fun games you can play with your remote or mouse. The goal of these games is to complete these tasks to become the dragon warrior. There is a commentary with the directors of the movie. There is also an interesting documentary featuring chef Alton Brown. This feature shows a Chinese chef making noodles. There is even a feature about how to use chopsticks. This makes me hungry. My favorite feature though is the Dreamworks Juke Box on this DVD. I love listening and watching the songs and videos from other Dreamworks movies like Shrek 2 and Bee Movie. Kung Fu Panda is one of the best family movies of the year. I love this DVD.

Eat, Pray, Love is a book about Elizabeth Gilbert's Search for Everythng Across Italy, India and Indonesia. What she finds is pleasure in learning the Italian language. She learned the language by going to school, reading the newspaper, and even going to soccer games. She also found pleasure going around the country eating delicious food like pizza and mushrooms. Elizabeth Gilbert found friendship with a man named Richard in a temple in India. He taught her to let go of the guilt from her failed relationships and forgive herself. She struggled learning the long daily chants, but she eventually learned to appreciate the discipline the life in the temple provided In Indonesia, she continued her spiritual growth by learning meditation exercises from a medicine man. A memoir with this title has to include someone falling in love. Gilbert does fall in love with a Brazilian business man named Felipe. However, what is more satisfying is that Elizabeth finally learns to love and accept herself at the end of the book. Gilbert is also a very descriptive writer. I could visualize myself walking with her on the beautiful beaches in Bali reading this book. I could also see myself looking at the lovely fountains in Rome too. This is an entertaining memoir.

This is an excellent CD of Grammy nominated songs. My favorite track is the soulful song If I Aint Got You by R and B sensation Alicia Keys. I also enjoyed the clarity and power of Josh Groban's voice on his hit song You Raise Me Up. The Black Eyes Peas Let's Get It Started has become a dance anthem. This song really pumps me up every time I hear it. I loved the song Redneck Woman by Gretchen Wilson. It is a song about being proud of who you are. Redneck Woman is proof that country music does not have to be slow and romantic to be enjoyable. I think this song rocks! Another highlight on this CD for me is the song Heaven by the Los Lonely Boys. I liked the way these brothers from Texas combine elements of country, rock and pop to create their own unique sound called Tex Mex. The best duet of the year is the song Here We Go Again by Norah Jones and music legend Ray Charles. These singers both have distinct unique voices, and they sound superb together. U2's Vertigo is a great techno dance hit. It is great to see the boys from Ireland back on the music scene again. I love Brian Wilson's song Good Vibrations. This classic song by the Beach Boys has some new lyrics, and it still sounds great. This CD celebrates the diversity of music this past year. I enjoyed all the songs on this CD.

I really enjoyed this CD. Rod Stewart covers 14 classic jazz and easy listening standards in the second of the Great American song book series. Rod's voice is so relaxing on this album. My favorite track is Rod's duet with Queen Latifah As Time Goes By. I think they do an excellent job covering this classic song by Frank Sinatra. Queen Latifah has such a smooth and pleasant voice. She really displays that on this track. I've never heard of the song Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered before, but I really liked it. Cher has still has that same low, smoky sexy voice of hers, and she sounds great with Rod on this duet.Rod Stewart sings his rendition of the Gershwin classic Someone to Watch Over Me so Well. I really sensed a longing for love in his voice on this track. I'm in the Mood for Love is another highlight for me on this album. The sax playing on this track is so good. Rod creates such a romantic mood on these songs especially the song I Only Have Eyes For You. I think this song is very sweet. I also liked the song Don't Get Around Much Anymore too. The piano playing on this track is beautiful. I think Rod captures the sentiment of missing a loved one so well on this song. I enjoyed listening to this album very much. If you are a fan of classic jazz or easy listening music, you will love this CD.

Phil Collins has never sounded better on this new wonderful CD Testify. Wake Up Call is an excellent opening track that urges people to wake up and enjoy life. Come With Me is a great romantic song in the typical Phil Collins fashion. It is one of my favorite songs on this CD. The song Testify is a wonderful affirmation of his love and committment to his new wife. Don't get me started is a song about looking for truth and integrity in today's society that seems to be lacking those two things. It is a good social commentary song. Swing Low is a song about working together towards achieving the goal of peace and self understanding. Its not too late is a delightful song about how it is never to late in life to chase your dreams. Thur my eyes is a song with thoughtful lyrics about trying to see the world through another person's point of view. Can't Stop Loving You is the first single released off this album and one of my favorites. It is just a great love song about yearning for a lost love. Testify is Phil Collins at his best.

The Garden State soundtrack has a variety of songs that fit the movie perfectly. The Coldplay track Don't Panic is a pretty song about how people can rely on each other when times get tough. Caring is Creepy by The Shins is such a great track. This song is a reminder that we should always try to be honest with ourselves and live our lives the best way we can. I also enjoyed the track I Just Don't Think I'll Get Over You by Collin Hay. It is a beautiful song about how hard it is to get over someone you love so much. There are so many other tracks I like especially One of These Things First. This is a very soothing song about all the qualities you want in a friend like being loyal and supportive. I really enjoyed the techno dance sound of the track Let Go by Frou Frou too. This is a wonderful soundtrack to one of the best movies of the year.

Running with Scissors is the true story of how a young gay man named Augusten Burroughs grew up in the house of his mother's psychiatrist and his family. His mother left him in the care of a Dr Finch after her divorce from Augusten's alcoholic father. This left her mentally unstable. Augusten Burroughs subsequently attempted suicide at the age of 13, because he didn't want to go to school any more. His suicide attempt was approved of by his mother and the psychiatrist who would become his legal guardian. His formal education ended in the 7th grade as a result of that attempt. Burroughs had a sexual often abusive relationship as a child with a man twice his age for most of his teens. Burroughs grew up in a house where people ate dog food as a snack. He lived in a household where the shape of human feces was saved and looked upon as a method of telling the future. Augusten's closest relationship is with his stepsister Natalie. The things they did together are very funny.One of the funniest parts in the book would have to be the part where Augusten and Natalie sing for a group of unruly mental patients for fun. I also loved reading the funny chapter in which Augusten and his sister threw some hotel furniture in a swimming pool in a frustrated effort to find a pair of earrings. Running With Scissors has a combination of serious and funny elements. I enjoyed this book very much.

I liked the variety of songs on this soundtrack. The themes of loss, death, renewal, and frustration in the show are expressed in these songs. Nina's Simone's sultry voice on Feelin Good is a perfect first track. The hit song A Rush of Blood to the Head by Coldplay is included on this CD. I think this is a great song about the drastic and often violent measures people can go to when they feel frustrated with life. I also enjoyed the song Breathe Me by Sia. This is a pretty song about how fragile human existence really is. I think Breathe Me is also a song about the need to reach out to someone. Everything is Everything is a song with a great beat. This song is about feeling that the demands of life are too overwhelming.Angajou is another one of my favorite tracks on this CD. I loved the relaxing latin sound. The song really gets me moving. Don't Fear The Reaper by the Ceasars is an excellent cover of a classic song by Blue Oyster Cult. This song really rocks. I loved it. Time on My Side is a song with a nice spiritual sound that I liked. I think that Imogen Heap has a beautiful voice. She contributes her talents here with a very pretty song entitled Lonely Little Petunia. There is a great song by Radiohead entitled Lucky. This song is about having an optimism about life despite going through a lot of hard times. This is an excellent soundtrack to one of the best dramatic shows on TV. I will miss it.

This soundtrack has many good songs both new and old. Every song on this CD is a winner. The 2 new songs by Destiny's Child are great. Independent Woman fits the theme of the movie perfectly. This CD features songs I haven't heard in years. I particularly liked Groove is in the Heart from the early 90s. You Make Feel Like Dancing from the mid 70s. I loved the dance classics Heaven Must be Missing an Angel, and Got to Give It Up from early 70s. I loved the songs True and Turning Japanese from the early 80s. Add this great soundtrack to your collection.

Johnny Mathis performs 10 classic song standards, and I loved them all. His voice is so pleasant and smooth. This CD is definitely romantic. There are some great love songs on this CD like Isn't It Romantic and There's a Kind of Hush. The song Cottage For Sale is the kind of song that gives you a warm cozy feeling. Listening to these songs made me wish that I had someone to hold in my arms. Johnny picks up the pace a little bit on the track This Can't Be Love. Johnny gives a lively upbeat performance on this track. His duet Over The Rainbow with the late great Ray Charles is one of my favorites. These two legendary voices sound perfect together. I also enjoyed the song Almost Like Being In Love. The sax playing on this track sounds so good. Another highlight track on this CD for me is track the Rainbow Connection. I first heard this song performed in the Muppet movie when I was a kid, and I have loved it ever since. Johnny sings this song just delightfully. The entire CD is filled with beautiful music. I highly recommend it.

Eats Shoots & Leaves is a very helpful reference book especially if you have to write a lot of papers for school.This book has shown me a former student how much I did not know about punctuation and that is why I enjoyed it.I thought that an apostrophe only indicated possession. I also learned that an apostrophe can be used to indicate time or quantity or the omission of letters. Lynne Truss explains the functions and usage of common punctuation marks like the apostrophe, comma, semicolon, and colon very clearly. I really did not know how a semicolon or colon could be used. A semicolon shows the reader the relationship between 2 different statements. Colons separate subtitles from main titles in books or movies. She provides the reader with sentences with the punctuation marks in the right place. I really appreciated seeing how they worked in sentences.There are 17 rules about how a comma is used. Commas are not only used in lists and to join sentences. They are also used to separate clauses to make reading easier and are used before direct speech. The information in this book may sound basic to some people, but I found it pretty interesting. This book will make me a better writer and a better observer when I see a misuse of punctuation. Lynne Truss points out how punctuation can be misused everywhere on movie posters and even everyday email. Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a wonderful written book.

If you grew up in the 70s and 80's like I did, you will recoginze and enjoy this 2 CD set. Tina Turner has been making hit records for over 40 years. I really enjoyed her older songs like Proud Mary and River Deep Mountain High. She has covered songs performed by other artists. Her cover of Al Green's hit Lets Stay Together sounds really good. Her music has been featured on movie soundtracks like the song We Don't Need Another Hero from the movie Max Max Beyond Thunderdome. Her hit Goldeneye was the theme song to the James Bond movie from a few years ago. Tina reached the height of her popularity in 1984 with songs like Whats Love Gotta Do With It and Private Dancer. Her hit streak continued in the early 1990s with songs like I Don't Wanna Fight and The Best. I loved her duet with Bryan Adams entitled It's Only Love. There is another duet here called Cose Della Vita. It is one of the few songs I did not know. It is a very good song that shows off the power and the subtle sexy quality of Tina Turner's voice. All the Best is a very enjoyable collection of songs from a pop music icon.

I love food, so naturally I was interested in this book when I saw it. This is an excellent book with many good recipes in it. I can't wait to try some of these recipes out and make some of these dishes for myself. I enjoyed reading about the memories from Maya Angelou's life that accompany these recipes too. Food has played such an important part in her life. I enjoyed reading about how she got over her writer's block once by making custard and chocolate eclairs. There is a delicious recipe for a caramel cake that Maya learned from her grandmother. Caramel cake is a reminder to the author about how much she was loved by her grandmother. I learned a lot of recipes for dishes I never even heard of. Chakchouka is a vegetarian stew that consists of eggplant, tomatoes and onions. I also learned a recipe for a dish called Cassoulet which has pea beans served with various meats like pork, duck, chicken and sausage.There is a good recipe for chicken tamales that Maya learned from her girlfriend who was trying to impress a doctor that she really liked. I love Mexican food so I appreciated this recipe very much. There are pictures for some of these dishes in this book. My favorite picture is the one of porkchops. Maya learned to cook pork chops from her older brother Bailey. The picture in the book shows pork chops served with apples on top of it, and it looks delicious.Respect for good food can eliminate distances between sexes and languages. Maya recalls the time when she cooked Thanksgiving dinner for a group of Italian scholars in Italy. I recommend this book to anybody who enjoys good food. I enjoyed the recipes and stories in this book very much.

Luciano Pavarotti will live on forever. His powerful voice is so uplifting and soothing. I love this music, because it sparked my interest in learning the Italian language. My favorite track is the lively "La Donna E Mobile" composed by Verdi. I also love Pavrotti's rendition of Verdi's "Libiamo Ne Lieti Calici". This song is a celebration of life. "La Danza" or the dance is an up tempo track from Rossini. "O Sole Mio" is such a pretty romantic song. This track is a pure gem. His voice sounds so elegant on the track "Nessum Dorma". "Mappari" is another standout track. Pavarotti sounds so peaceful here singing about a place where sound never dies. This is beautiful music from a singing legend.

Beyond the Sea is an excellent soundtrack. I didn't know that Kevin Spacey could sing so well. He croons the songs of Bobby Darin so well, I thought I was listening to the man himself. This CD put me in such a good mood. I can't wait to see the movie now. My favorite track is Mack The Knife which was a hit for Bobby Darin in 1959. I also loved the song Beyond The Sea. It is one of those classic songs I always hear at dances and parties. I love the sincerity in Kevin Spacey's voice on the track Simple Song of Freedom. Dream Lover is another standout track that I recognized on this CD. It is a very romantic song and one of Bobby Darin's biggest hits. Beyond the Sea is a very entertaining soundtrack.

I really enjoyed the album Acoustic. I never knew John had such a natural talent for playing the guitar, but he obviously did. He composed these songs in the 70's after the breakup of the Beatles. These tracks sound better when performed acoustically, because I could really understand the lyrics and message behind the song. My favorite track is John Lennon's anthem for peace entitled Imagine. It is one of the best songs ever written and it brings tears to my eyes. I loved the song Watching The Wheels. I haven't heard this song in years. It reminded to cherrish my time on earth because life is short.My Mummy's Dead is a very touching song about John Lennon losing his mother as a child and the pain he still felt as an adult. Dear Yoko is a very pretty love song from Lennon to his wife. I liked this track very much.Woman is a Nigger of the World is a song that some people may get offended by because of the title, but I hope they listen to the words before judging it. The lyrics are very powerful. This song is about the urge for equality and respect for women after being treated so badly and unfairly in the past.Working Class Hero is another great track. This song is about praising how hard it is to make a living with all the distractions in the world and remain true to your principles. I think this is something John Lennon understood well. It amazes me that John Lennon's music is still popular today over twenty years after his death. His songs and the messages in them are timeless.

Bruce Springsteen has introduced a whole new generation of people to the music of Pete Seeger. John Henry is my favorite track on this album. It has all the musicians playing in perfect harmony. We Shall Overcome is another one of my favorites on this album. This is a beautiful song about the call for peace and unity in the world. Jessie James is another standout track here. The violin playing gives this song an energetic pleasant sounding quality. Pay My Money Down and the bonus track Buffalo Gals are two very fun songs that I enjoyed. My Oklahoma Home and Shenadoah are two beautiful tracks about the love a person can have for their home. I really enjoyed listening to the music and watching the DVD features especially the recording of the album.

Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway is an excellent CD. Most of these on the songs on this album are about different aspects of falling in love or breaking up with someone, but I enjoyed it anyway. My favorite song is the title track. It is a great song about asserting your own independence and living your own life. I have loved this song ever since it appeared on Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack this past summer. The other hit on this album is the song Since You Been Gone. It is a song about moving on with your life after being in a bad relationship. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics in this song. I also liked the song Because of You. This song is about the damage and insecurities that linger when you get out of a bad relationship.Walk Away is a track with a song with a great beat. It is a song about being fed up and frustrated with a boyfriend who constantly disappoints and lets you down. Kelly sounds really good on this track. Where is Your Heart is a very pretty song about wanting someone you love to give you the emotional support you need. Breakaway is a CD with a lot of hit songs that appeal to Kelly's fan base of young adults. I highly recommend this CD.

This is a great soundtrack. All of these songs are excellent. Feel Good Time by Pink sounds pretty good. I like the nice beat of this song. A Girl Like You by Edwyn Collins is a very smooth song that I liked very much. Nickleback's version of Elton John's Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting sounds ok. It is a song that fits well in this movie about tough women though. Loverboy's Working For Weekend and Journey's Anyway You Want, and Bon Jovi's Livin On A Prayer are just awesome rock songs from the 80's. They brought back a lot of memories from my teenage years. I love the classic songs from the 70's included here especially Donna Summer's Last Dance and Andy Gibb's I Just Wanna Be Your Everything. These 2 songs came out in the disco era of the 1970's when the original Charlie's Angels TV series was on television. Natalie Cole's This Will Be An Everlasting Love is a just a great feel good song. David Bowie's classic song Rebel Rebel sounds great remastered. MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This is a very good dance song from the early 90's and a wonderful addition to this soundtrack. This is one of the best soundtracks of the year so far.

The Lovely Bones is a wonderfully well written and thoughtful book from beginning to end. It is about how the murder of a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon changes the lives of her family and friends. This book has an interesting premise that people in heaven still long for things on earth. Each character is affected by her death greatly. Susie watches the lives of the people she loves from heaven. She watches her friends and siblings grow up. I loved reading about the romantic relationship between Susie's younger sister Lindsay and her boyfriend Samuel. I love the psychic connection Susie has with her friend Ruth Connors. Susie's spirit inhabits Ruth's body in one of the most touching parts of the book. Susie's parents respond to their daughter's death in very different ways. This causes them to drift apart. Susie's mother strays away physically and emotionally from her family for several years to forget the pain of her loss. Susie's father organizes memorials to remember his daughter every year on the anniversary of her death. However, he is unable to part with his Susie's clothes several years after her death. It is interesting to read how their marriage breaks apart and mends itself back together. Every character including Susie up in heaven learns to accept her death and move on. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.

Carly Simon is one of the best singer songwriters of all time. and Reflections has all of her greatest hits. My favorite song is Anticipation, This is a song Carly wrote while waiting to go on a date with Cat Stevens. You're So Vain is another favorite song of mine. It was a big hit for Carly in the early 70's. I also love the song Nobody Does It Better which is the theme song to the James Bond movie Octopussy. Jessie is a great song about all the things you would do for a friend. I haven't heard Jessie in years, and I still enjoy listening to it. Love of My Life is one of most romantic songs I ever heard. It is definitely another one of my favorites. Her duet Mockingbird with her ex husband James Taylor is excellent Their voices sound really good together. Let The River Run is another great song. I like this song, because it shows the power of Carly Simon's voice. Carly Simon's voice conveys so much wisdom, warmth and compassion in her songs and that is what I have always loved about her. Reflections is an excellent CD for anyone who enjoys soft rock music.

The Pillars of the Earth is an excellent novel. It is a very long book, but it is a very entertaining book about life in England in the Middle Ages. I loved the rivalries between the good guys and bad guys in this book. The theme of this book is that a church can bring people together. Another theme in the book is that anything can be achieved through hard work. The church is not only a place of worship in this book. It is a symbol of pride for the many people who help in building it. The church is also a haven for people who are hungry and homeless. Furthermore, the church is also a place of learning in this book. I really enjoyed reading about how a monastery is organized and how every monk has a job. There are many characters in this book, but two really stuck out for me. I love the determination of Philip in this book. He is a compassionate man has a strong sense of justice. I also love the strength of the character Aliena who overcomes poverty to become successful. I know that not everyone has the time to read a book of this length, but it is a great read.

The Measure Of A Man is an interesting autobiography. Sidney Poitier had only two years of formal education. Yet, he had the determination to make a life for himself as an actor. He lived on a Caribbean island for the first ten years of his life. His father, Reginald, was a tomato farmer who instilled in him the belief that the measure of a man is how well he provides for his family. Even after the collaspe of his marriage, Sidney continued to be a supportive father to his daughters.His mother Evelyn was another big influence in his life and work ethic. She got up before the sun rose and worked until dark washing clothes and dishes. She also worked on the tomato farm, and baked bread. A candle was considered a gift and a luxury, because Poitier lived on an island with no electricity and no running water. Another influence on Poitier's life was his older brother Cyril. He managed to put his nine children through college while earning $85 a week as an airport porter.Struggling to make ends meet, Poitier worked as a dishwasher, janitor, and restaurant worker before becoming an actor. Even after tasting some professional success, he experienced racism as a young actor. In one incident, a screen had to put around him just so that he could eat in a restaurant in the early fifties. Poitier's career has been a reminder that people from different races can live in peace. What I found interesting is how Sidney Poiter views acting not as an exercise in pretending but an exercise in being real. In the movie Guess Whose Coming To Dinner, he plays a doctor romantically interested in a white woman. This was an landmark performance, because inter racial relationships was still a new concept in the late sixties. This is an excellent book club pick by Oprah.

I am blown away by the music on this album. It is so beautiful. My favorite track is the song Danny Boy. It is a solemm Celtic standard that is usually performed when someone dies. It sounds very peaceful. I also enjoyed the song Ave Maria. The harp playing gives this track a very romantic quality. Orinoco Flow is another highlight on this album. This song sounds even more powerful and majestic when performed by an excellent emsemble of musicians like Celtic Woman. I also enjoyed the fiddle playing on the track The Butterfly. I thought this track sounded playful and fun. The fiddle playing on the Ashoken Farewell conveys a sense of sadness and sentiment. Another noteworthy song is You Raise Me Up. This track sounds very inspirational and uplifting. I loved listening to this CD.

Songs about Jane by Maroon 5 is a very interesting album. It has elements of rock, R and B, pop and punk music. The best song is the Grammy nominated song She Will Be Loved. This song is a reminder that we all need someone to lean on when things get tough. I also like the song Through With You. It is a nice rock song about feeling frustrated with a lover who constantly lets you down. Sunday Morning is a very smooth song about trying to get back to the person you love. This Love is another hit on this CD. It is about the emotional strain it takes to keep a relationship working. Harder To Breathe is an excellent rock song about feeling suffocated by someone. This song pumps me up every time I listen to it. Not Coming Home is another great fast song with excellent guitar licks. This song is about how people get stronger because of the abuse they endure in relationships. The Sun is another one of my favorite tracks. It is about how we can both love and hate a person at the same time. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics on this track. Songs About Jane is one of the best albums of 2004. I really enjoyed it.

Kung Fu Panda 2 is the much anticipated sequel to the 2008 hit movie. This movie has two plots. The first plot involves an evil peacock named Shen. He threatens to destroy kung fu with a cannon. It is up to Po and Furious Five to save kung fu and stop Shen's evil ways. it is established in the first movie that Po's father is a goose named Ping. A goose can't be the father of a panda. This movie explores Po's roots further and answers the question of what really happened to Po's parents. Po is the dragon master, but he is advised by Master Shi fu to find inner peace. This quest for inner peace gives this film a spiritual quality the first film did not have. Po learns that it does not matter how a panda starts out in life. The important thing to remember how a panda chooses to be and live his life in the present. This lesson can also be applied to people as well.Gary Oldman provides the voice of Shen. His movements are quick and graceful. I love watching Shen move especially in the fight sequences. Oldman's voice work is very good here. Jack Black is equally excellent providing the voice of Po. He is so funny in one scene trying to eat as many dumplings as he can. He is fun to watch fighting wolves or dodging blasts from Shen's cannon. Dustin Hoffman provides the voice of Master Shih Fu. The fun is figuring out who provides the voices of the minor characters like the crocodile and hippo. Every scene of this movie is bright and colorful too. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a very entertaining movie.

Forty Licks is an excellent collection of songs from one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time. Even if you are not famillar with every Rolling Stones song, you will enjoy Forty Licks like I did. I enjoyed their older songs from the 60's and early 70's the best like Jumpin Jack Flash , Satisfaction, Brown Sugar, and Ruby Tuesday to name a few. I liked a lot more songs every This wonderful retrospective also includes hits like Miss You, Beast of Burden, and the song You Can't Always Get What You Want. I love this song, because I agree the message in the song. You can always get what you want, but if you try you get what you need.I would like to have seen Waiting on a Friend and Time Is On My Side included here. Start Me Up is a song that will always pump me up. It is one of my favorites and I'm glad to see it on here. Emotional Rescue is another great track from the early 80's. The four new tracks are pretty good. The best new track is the energetic song Don't Stop and the romantic Keys to your love. 40 Licks is a very enjoyable listen.

Madeleine Peyroux's voice conveys so many emotions on this album. She hypnotizes the listener with her beautiful voice. The piano playing by Larry Goldings is a perfect compliment to her voice on all these tracks. I know that most of these songs were originally performed by other singers, but Madeleine has the ability with her incredible voice to make these songs her own. One of my favorite tracks is the song Dance Me To the End of Love. I felt like I was floating on air while listening to this song. It has a very romantic quality. I think this song also has a deeper meaning that we should savor our time on earth because life is short. Another standout track on this album is the song Don't Wait Too Long. This song is performed in a lively swing style. It is an original composition written by Peyroux and songwriter Jesse Harris. Listeners can relate to the lyrics of this song because of how true it is to life. The message of this song is that sometimes people have to hit rock bottom to realize what is important in life. You're Going To Make Lonesome When You Go is a song that just puts me in a great mood. I love the smoothness in Madelenie's voice and the poetic images of nature on this track. French is such a sensual sounding language. Peyroux displays the beauty of it on the song J'ai Deux Amours. This song was performed by a singer named Josephine Baker and sung to soldiers during World War II to inspire them to come home safely.Careless Love is an album that has increased my appreciation for classic jazz music. The title track is a song with timeless lyrics about how someone we love can drive us crazy. This song made me feel happy and sad at the same time. Not too many songs can do that for me. Weary Blues From Waiting is a song that perfectly conveys the loneliness one feels when waiting for a loved one to return to them. I really felt a sense of yearning in Madelenie's voice on this track. It is so good. I really enjoyed this CD. I just hope that I don't have to wait so long to hear from this talented singer again.

I enjoyed reading this book very much. Diane Ackerman takes a complex subject like the human brain and makes it easy to understand. Ackerman begins each chapter with thought prokoking quotes by famous writers, thinkers, and popular movies. My favorite quote in the book is by author Pearl Buck. It is about how people have a need to express themselves creatively. My other favorite quote is from Franz Kafka that says that being happy changes your entire outlook on life.I loved the way Ackerman explains how the brain works in simple language. I learned that neurons grow new dendritic connections every time a person learns something new or expands on connections that already exists. Neurons communicate with each other by using axons.There is an interesting chapter in this book that explains the differences between the way men and women think. Women solve problems using both sides of the brain. Men use only the side that specializes in that problem. Men lose more brain cells in the temporal and frontal lobes affecting feeling and thinking as they age. Women lose more brain cells in the hippocampus affecting memory as they get older. Ackerman makes an interesting observation that women worry about losing emotional attachments. This is in contrast to men who worry about losing face.I also learned that human beings share the same motives, feelings and instincts with animals. We all share and seek a need for protection, hunger, status seeking, social contact, sexual desire, and acceptance. I also learned that tool use isn't just limited to monkeys and humans. Crows have the ability to bend wire into a hook to retrieve food in a bucket.One of the most interesting sections of this book is the one about memory. I learned that the brain does four things to remember. It recognizes patterns, interprets them, records their source, and retrieves them. Ackerman defines the different types of memory which I found helpful. Working memory holds crates of information for immediate use, but it can only do one thing at a time. Episodic memories are those that are linked to a certain feeling. Memory suffers when we are under stress or if we are bored. Challenge, exercise, and novelty of new things improve our memory. I really liked the way Ackerman connects the subject of memory and language. Language gives us a verbal memory that allows us to learn and remember without physically experience something. Words serve as memory aids for some people too.An Alchemy of Mind is a very informative and entertaining book. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about neuroscience or psychology.

This CD is an unique musical collaboration that combines the soulful sweet lyrics of Ray Charles and the delightful sound of the current Count Basie orchestra. Every instrument sounds perfect on this disc. I love the trumpet and trombrone playing throughout this disc. Ray Charles conveys a range of emotions with his voice on this CD. He expresses such joy on the tracks Oh What A Beautiful Morning and Let The Good Times Roll. I Can't Stop Loving You and Come Live With Me are two very romantic soulful love songs. Georgia On My Mind is an unique song about the love for a state. It is a beautiful track and a very touching state song. I love the playfulness in Ray's voice on the tracks Every Saturday Night and Busted. I love the tone in Ray's voice on the track The Long And Winding Road. He sounds so wise and sensual. Feel So Bad is a lively song about losing a loved one. This CD is filled with beautiful music.

The title of this two CD set refers to the two locations where this great music was recorded live. Birdland is a club in New York. Yoshi is a club in Oakland California. Jacqui Naylor entertains her audiences on both coasts with a mix of original compositions and a wide range cover songsOne of my favorite songs is her cover of the Gershwin tune But Not For Me. The amazing piano playing by James Khu and an equally superb performance by Jon Evans on bass is worthy of note here The Wind is a great original composition written by Jacqui Naylor. This song is about the yearning for companionship and the instant emotional connections a person can make with someone. I love the piano playing on this track. It is very subtle and lovely. I really liked the track It'll Be Fine. It is a song about following your own path in life and doing your own thing. Thank You Baby is a track Jacqui devotes to her husband. It is an excellent song about gratitude and devotion.The song Money is about how driven some people can become in trying to acquire wealth and material possessions. Jon Evans provides an excellent bass sound on this song. Before I'm Gone is a song about searching for a purpose in life. Bob Johnson enhances this track with his hypnotic saxophone playing. I loved it. City By The Bay sounds like a poem about Jacqui's Naylor's love of San Francisco. The cello playing on this track by Jessica Irvy is really good here. Her perfornance gives this song a nice romantic touch. Naylor performs a groovy rendition of the Led Zeppelin song Black Coffee. Jacqui takes a song from a rock genre and performs it in her own unique style. Julie's song is a very personal song about a lifelong friendship she cherrishes. I loved the music contained on these two compact discs. Jackie Naylor is a very talented performer and an insightful songwriter. This is great music.

This is an excellent score from Michael Giacchino. The first two tracks capture the romance of the setting of France perfectly. Camille has a sexy singing voice on the track "Le Festina". "Welcome To Gusteau's" is a warm and inviting track. I love the accordion playing here. I love the jazzy sound of the track "Cast Of Cooks" The sax playing is cool and slick. I love the frenetic pace of the tracks "100 Rat Race" and "The Paper Chase" "Remy Drives A Linguini" is a very fun track about the relationship between the two main characters. The music featured in the ending credits is sensual. It has a tango like sound. This score is so much fun to listen to.

This is a very special collection of Christmas songs from Bette Midler. Mele Kalikimaka is my favorite track. It is a very fun song that puts me in a good mood. It is so popular in Hawaii at Christmas time. Cool Yule is a tune with a delightful swing style sound. I love this song. The distinctive voice of Johnny Mathis is still so pleasant and melodic. He sounds so good singing Winter Wonderland and Let It Snow with Bette. I love the classic standards on here like White Christmas and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas. What Are You Doing On New Year's Eve is another highlight on this CD. Bette sounds so sensual here, and the piano playing accompanies her vocals so well. From A Distance is one of Bette Midler's most famous tunes. I don't consider it a typical Christmas song, but it is a great song about peace around the world. Come Emmanuel is a beautiful spiritual song that features the violin and acoustic guitar. I like this track a lot. This is an excellent CD of Christmas music.

I love this disc. Sara Bareilles has a beautiful voice. Every song sounds different. My favorite track is the "Love Song". Sara's piano playing is upbeat and so lively here. "Gravity" is a slower tempo song about how fragile life can be. This song is really pretty. "Vegas" is a great song about looking for adventure in places like Las Vegas and New York. There is power and grit in Sara's voice that I really like here. "Morningside" is an engaging track about relationships. It has a sensual soulful quality. I love the beat of the track "Love On The Rocks". She hits notes perfectly on the song. "Fairytale" is an interesting spin on the myth of happy endings in fairytales. "Many the Miles" is a very good song about the things people do for love. I love the music on this disc.

This is an interesting album by Feist. "1234" is the highlight of this disc. It is a fun song that makes me feel good. "Brandy Alexander" is a song about a love for a cocktail drink. I love the piano playing and her vocals on this track. "My Moon My Man" is a groovy track with a good beat. She takes the Nina Simone tune "Sea Lion" and makes it her own. She rocks on the guitar on this track. "So Sorry" is a beautiful song with a romantic tone. "Past In Present" is another pleasant upbeat track. "I Feel It All" is a track with good musical arrangements. I love all the percussion instruments on this track. "The Park" is a very soothing sounding track. There is something about her guitar playing that puts my mind at ease on this track. This is a very enjoyable disc from Feist.

This is a wonderful book of poems. The subjects are so diverse and the titles of the poems are unique. There are several titles that caught my eye such as The Death of the Hat, Shoveling Snow With Buddha, My Best Cigarette, Victoria's Secret, and Questions about Angels. One of the most descriptive and imaginative poems in the book is Victoria's Secret. He conjures up a variety of emotions in this poem by looking at the pictures and facial expressions of the models in the catalog. I enjoy the poem The Death of A Hat, because it talks about an ordinary object and the symbolism that was formally attached to it. According to this poem, a hat symbolized a sense of identity and loyalty. My Best Cigarette is a great poem along the same logic as death of a hat. A cigarette to Billy Collins was like a catalyst in the writing process. It was the best way to relax for him. One of the most personal poems in this book is the Iron Bridge. Collins remembers his mother who recently has died and compares her to a bridge that is as old as her. He is trying to come to terms with his loss and move on with his life in this beautiful poem.I love the poems in this book with a subtle message. One poem in particular is Advice to Writers. In this poem, Collins says that good writing is polished writing. Therefore, the writing process should be deliberate and never rushed. I loved the poem Aristole. It has so many creative metaphors about the cycle of life contained in the poem. Collins compares the beginning of life to a fish wriggling onto land. He also compares the beginning of life to a first move in a chess game. In the same poem, he compares the middle of life like cities filled with people with a million schemes and looks. Finally, Collins compares the end of life to the last elephant in a parade. I found all the metaphors in this poem to be so insightful.Billy Collins has several poems about animals in this book. He associates different animals with several human feelings. He writes about the plight of tortured cows in the poem Afternoon with Irish Cows. He ponders the reason for the blindness of mice which is an allusion to the nursery rhyme Three Blind Mice. He writes about how a dog can feel so alone and unwanted in the poem To A Stranger Born in Some Distant Country Hundreds of Years From Now.Some of Billy Collins poems are obviously composed just by observing everyday life. A good example of this is poem The Waitress. In this poem, he writes about all the people who have waited on him in his life. Collins imagines how liberating it must feel for waitresses to be free of their duties in a wonderful metaphor. He writes about how the movies can help someone escape the pressures of everyday life. Sailing Alone Around the Room is an excellent book. Reading it has inspired me to continue writing my own poetry.

John Ondrasik has the voice of an angel on the track The Riddle. This is an excellent song about the relationship between a parent and a child. In my opinion, this is a very deep song that questions our very existence as human beings. Freedom Never Cries is an excellent song about the tragic price people often pay for freedom. Two Lights is a song about going off to war in Iraq. These are two similar songs in terms of theme and I enjoyed them. Califormia Justice is an interesting song about a person running from the law after committing a crime. 65 Mustang is a highlight song about how a car can trigger a person's memories of their younger days. I Just Love You is a very pretty love song. Johnny America is an upbeat song about a person working hard to achieve a goal. Road to Heaven is a spiritual and moving song. John hits all the high notes perfectly here, On a final note, I think John Ondrasik plays the piano and guitar beautifully on all of these tracks. His skill as a musician really compliments his talents as a vocalist. I really enjoyed listening to this CD.

This CD has all of Luther's greatest hits. This album contains the best R and B music from one of the most popular male artists from the last 25 years. I love all the tracks on this album. My favorite song is Never Too Much. This was one of Luther's first hits in the early 80's. It is a classic R and B track that still gets me moving. Give Me The Reason is another one of my favorite dance jams. Here and Now is another highlight for me on this CD. This is one of the prettiest love songs I've ever heard. There's Nothing Better Than Love is another excellent song about how it feels to be in love with someone.Luther can also sing about falling out of love with someone. I love his beautiful duet with Dionne Warwick entitled How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye. It is a bittersweet tune about the pain of breaking up with someone. A Home is Not A Home is a classic about how a home can be a strong symbol of love even when a couple is apart from each other. Luther's voice really moves the listener on this track. The music of Luther Vandross will live on forever.

I enjoyed reading about Bernard Kerik's life and accomplishments. He had a rough start being abandoned by his alcoholic prostitute mother at age 4. It was really touching to read about how Bernard Kerik learned about his mother who died at age 34.Bernard Kerik dropped out of high school at 16 when it was predicted by his principal that he would be nothing but a vegetable. Kerik began his law enforcement career as a military policeman in Korea in the Army. He studied and excelled in the martial art of Tai Kwon Do. His martial arts traning paid off as he later trained a Delta Force fighting group of soldiers. Kerik later became a New York City police officer where he seized tons of cocaine off the streets in the late 80s. Overall crime in New York reduced by 63 percent in 10 years There were 2,245 cases of murder in 1990 and 671 cases in 2000 mostly under the leadership of Mayor Giuliani and the efforts of cops like Bernard Kerik. He later became head of corrections of notorious Rikers jail where he reduced the number of assaults by inmates from 1,200 to 12 in just 1 year.The events of September 11th are talked about in this book. Kerik talks the courage, compassion, and dedication of the people who risked and lost their lives that day. These are qualities that Bernard Kerik has shown all his life. This is a wonderful book.

This is a good collection of Teena's music. This disc contains classics like "Behind The Groove" and "Lovergirl". A lesser known song "Square Biz" is included here. This track gets me out of my seat. It also has smooth jams like "Irons In The Fire" and "Young Love". "I Need Your Lovin" is a cut that makes me feel good. I also love the track "Portuguese Love" Teena sounds very sensual singing this romantic song. I also enjoy her love and leave them duet "Fire and Desire" with Rick James. Teena hits unbelieveable notes on this tune. "It Must Be Magic" is a song to listen to while working out. This is a fun song. This disc is missing other great songs by Teena like the lovely jazz tune "Sunny Skies" and "Star Child" I absolutely love these songs. This disc is not the ultimate collection because of those missing songs. I must say the music that is on this disc is very entertaining. Teena Marie's music will live on forever.

British singer Corinne Bailey Rae is a talented performer. She plays the piano, the guitar and various other instruments. She is first and foremost a R and B singer, but I think her voice simply appeals to anyone who enjoys good music. My favorite track is Put Your Records on. This is a perfect for the summer because, this song is about listening to music and having fun with your friends. Trouble Sleeping is another highlight here. Corinne Bailey Rae's vocals are smooth as silk on this song. I enjoyed the horn playing on this track very much. I love the track Call Me When You Get This. It is a song that gets my body moving. Like A Star and Enchantment are two very romantic tracks about how one person can change your life completely. I'd like To is a sensual track with a groovy beat. Choux Pastry Heart is a track that shows Corinne's talent on the piano. It is a beautiful but rather sad song. I enjoyed listening to this CD from Corrine Bailey Rae very much.

Israel Kamakawio'ole will forever be one of Hawaii's best singers and ukulele players. Facing Future is argurably his best solo album. I love every track on this album. My favorite track is Somewhere Over the Rainbow and What A Wonderful World. This song has become a popular anthem of celebration in Hawaii for special events like graduations and weddings. Another standout track is Henehene Kou Aka. Israel expresses the beauty of the Hawaiian language so well here. This song also shows the playful nature of his voice. Hawaiian Sup'pa Man is another favorite track of mine. I love this song. It is so upbeat and great to play at parties. I also loved the songs White Sandy Beach of Hawaii and Ka Pua U'i. Israel sounds so peaceful and angelic singing on these tracks. He plays the ukulele wonderfully and so effortlessly. It is a real pleasure to listen to. Israel's rendition of Take Me Home Country Road is another gem on this album. Facing Future is an excellent album by one of Hawaii's greatest musical talents. I really enjoyed it.

I love this CD Rabbit Fur Coat. The title track is a beautiful story song about the value people can put in material things. Jenny's vocals are so pretty here. It is strange that she is singing about such a sad and often true fact of life. Rise Up With Fists is another standout track here. This is a beautiful song that highlights Jenny's talent as a singer and a guitar player. I think the message of this song is that change comes slowly, but it is inevitable. Melt Your Heart is a pretty song about how our decisions all have consequences, and we have to live with the decisions we make Handle With Care is an enjoyable track. The Watson Twins provide great backup vocals on a song about how everyone needs somebody to help them get through the tough times. The Charging Sky is another good song that features Jenny playing the guitar. I love the spirit in her guitar playing here. This song about how life is short, and how we should live it without any regret. Jenny hits the high notes beautifully on the track Born Secular. I loved this song very much. Rabbit Fur Coat is a very entertaining CD. I loved it.

Styx is my all time favorite rock band. This CD brings back a lot of memories. These guys rocked in the mid 70s and early 80's with hits like Renegade and Grand Illusion. I loved the ballads on this CD like Babe, The Best of Times and, Lady. Singer Dennis Deyoung sounds great on lead vocals on these songs. I also loved the faster tunes like Too Much Time on My Hands and Mr Roboto, and Don't Let End. Sail Away is superb because it starts off subtle for a few minutes and picks up FAST and really rocks. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys classic rock music.

This is an excellent tribute album. It is very interesting to listen to these classic Moody Blues songs performed in a bluegrass style. My favorite track is Nights in White Satin. This is one of the most romantic songs ever recorded, and this cover captures the spirit of the song perfectly. Another highlight on this CD for me is the song I'm Just a Singer in A Rock and Roll Band. This is a very lively track. I really liked this song, because I can hear the beauty of the instruments especially the banjo and fiddle. The Voice is another track that is nicely done. This cover sounds faster than the original, but I still felt it sounded fresh.I've never heard the harp played in bluegrass music before. It is a lovely instrument that can be heard on the song Late Lament. I think that these Moody Blues songs performed bluegrass style sounds pretty good!

I love it when musicians collaborate on an album like this, because it gives me a chance to listen to performers I know very little about. It is wonderful to see a legend like Herbie Hancock on the music scene again. I have been a fan of his music since I heard the song RockIt in the early 80s. My favorite track is When Love Comes to Town featuring blues guitarist Jonny Lang. I love his vocals and his guitar playing blew me away. I think John Mayer is one of most talented young artists out there, and I'm glad he makes a contribution here with the first track Stitched Up. The bass on this song sounds sexy and smooth. Safiatou is another one of my favorites on this album. Carlos Santana gives this track a nice latin flavor with his hypnotic guitar licks. Angelique sounds so good on vocals here too. I think this is a nice song to dance to. There is a track on here entitled Sister Moon performed by Sting. This song has a very groovy bass beat sound that sounds so smooth. I think Herbie compliments Sting's vocals superbly on the keyboard here. I love Raul Midon's version of I Just Called To Say I Love You. It has a slower tempo than the original. I think this version is just as pretty though. I enjoyed Stevie Wonder's harmonica playing on this track too. Pop diva Christina Aguilera lends her incredible vocal talents on the track A Song For You. This is a very pretty song. I think Herbie accompanies her well on the piano keyboard. Don't Explain is a lovely song performed by Lisa Hannigan. Herbie's piano playing gives this song a very subtle romantic quality. I really enjoyed listening to this CD, and I would recommend it to anyone.

This is a very good soundtrack for people who like rock music. There is not a bad track on the entire CD. My favorite song is Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional. I think their lead singer Chris Carrabba has a such a soothing but powerful voice. I also loved the song Ordinary by Train. It is a good song about struggling to live an ordinary life. I have never heard of the band Yellowcard before, but they sound great on the track Gifts and Curses. The music compliments the themes of the movie very well like every good soundtrack should. The song Woman by Maroon 5 is very smooth. I really liked it. I loved the songs Night the lights went out in NYC by the Ataris and Did You by Hoobastank. I think these are two very good groups. I want to hear more from these bands because of this awesome soundtrack. The two Danny Elfman instrumentals sound so suspenseful and dramatic. I loved them too.

This CD did not play on my computer, so I played it on my CD player. I don't like copy protected CDs as much as the next person, but it did not stop me from enjoying the music on this disc. I hope other people will enjoy this CD, despite the fact that it is copy protected. My favorite track is the upbeat song Delirious Love. I love the energy in Neil's voice and his guitar playing on this song very much. Hell Yeah is an interesting title for a song. This is a great tune about living your life with no regrets and just enjoying it. Captain of A Shipwreck is an excellent song about having the loyalty of a friend in your time of need. Save Me A Saturday Night is a song with a pretty sound. I liked the sentiment of friendship in this track.Neil's songs communicates so much wisdom on these songs. What's It Gonna Be is a good example. This message of this song is that we never know what we can achieve unless we try. Man of God is a beautiful song about we can have faith and hope in God without belonging to any organized religion. This is a very spiritual song, and I really liked it.We is another gem. This song is about how it takes two people working together to make a relationship work. I really liked the truth in the lyrics of this song. This song has a great old time sound to it. I really enjoyed listening to this CD. I think Neil sounds great.

Tender At The Bone is a very entertaining memoir. It is a memoir of the first thirty years of her Ruth Reichl's life. She is a renowned food writer with a passion for cooking. The recipes in this book sound delicious. I will keep this book as a reference when I try to make some of these recipes. Just reading this recipes motivates me to want to cook them. It really sparks my curiosity The recipes are often associated with a person or place in a specific time in Ruth's life. There is a recipe for corned beef ham that is served with peaches that sounds delectable. This is her mother Miriam's recipe.I like reading about the different jobs Ruth has held in her life. She has worked as in a pancake house and in a restaurant She has been a camp counselor and a food critic. Her career in the food industry is simply fascinating to me. Another interesting thing about Ruth's life would be the places where she has visited or lived in. She has visited North Africa, Greece, Italy, France and San Francisco. She gives the reader a sense of what food is like in these different parts of the world.There is a recipe for lemon souffle that is inspired by Ruth's trip to France as a teenager. I have never had this dish before. I would like to try it out. There is a recipe for a pate made up of chicken liver, garlic and onions. This recipe came from her time in Greece and Italy. There is another dish called called Con Queso rice. This is a dish that includes black beans with different kinds of cheeses with rice. There is another recipe for an Oleron tart that is made up of almonds and raspberries. I have a sweet tooth so I would love to try make this for myself. These recipes are easy to read and understand. There are no pictures of what these dishes look like. It is fun using my imagination trying to figure out what these dishes look like though.I like reading about the different relationships with the people in her early life. She devotes an entire chapter on her room mate Sarafina and another chapter about her husband Doug. It is interesting to read how these relationship grow and develop throughout the book.There are discussion questions at the end of this book. This is very helpful. It forces me to reflect on the different themes in the book. There are photos of Ruth and her family and friends at the end of the book. Tender To The Bone is an excellent memoir for people who like to read about cooking and travelling to different places. I love this book.

Jimmy Buffett gets some help from some of the biggest stars of country music. The results of their efforts becomes Jimmy Buffet's best album in years. Jimmy Buffett sounds great on License to Chill. My favorite track is Hey Good Looking. This is a very energetic song with all these great voices like Alan Jackson, Kenny Chesney, and Clint Black singing together. This song really rocks. Someone I Used to Love is a very pretty song. Nanci Griffith has a sexy and raspy voice that compliments Jimmy's easy listening voice nicely. Trip Around The Sun is a great song is about how to live life to the fullest and have no regrets about what you have done. Martina McBride is one of country music biggest stars. She lends her vocal talents on this excellent track. I love the song License to Chill. It is a good song about having fun enjoying the simple pleasures in life like kicking back relaxing and trying to meet women.I loved Jimmy Buffett's duet with George Strait entitled Sea of Heartbreak. I have always loved this song, because I can relate to these lyrics about remembering how it feels to be in love and have your heart broken by someone. License to Chill is just a pleasure to listen to. I really enjoyed it.

Johnny Cash will always be one of my favorite singers. His low rich distinctive voice conveyed a range of emotions. I don't have any of the other CD's in the American series, but I loved the variety of themes on these recordings. Help Me, I Came To Believe and God's Gonna Cut You Down are three songs that show that he a deep faith in God. Rose In My Heart and Love's Been Good to Me are beautiful love songs. If You Could Read My Mind is another standout love song on here. I'm Free From The Chain Gang is another highlight. This is an excellent song about appreciating your freedom after getting out of prison. He really sings from the heart on this song. Like the 309 and Further Up On the Road are two beautiful songs about death and approaching the end of life. I loved listening to the final recordings of Johnny Cash. I wouldn't be surprised if producer Rick Rubin received a Grammy for his work on this album.

Peggy Lee was one of the greatest jazz singers ever, and I think Bette Midler sounds great singing the hits of this musical legend. The first track is an excellent version of the classic song Fever. I think that Fever is one of the sexiest songs ever recorded and Bette sings it so well. Barry Manilow's musical arrangements on this CD are so fresh and crisp. I am Woman is the kind of song that portrays women as being feisty strong minded and indpendent people, and I loved it. I love the track Is that All There Is. This is a great song about enjoying life despite all of life's little disappointments.Peggy Lee was a very attractive and talented woman. I really liked looking at the old pictures of her while listening to Bette's great voice on the DVD side of this dual disc. I Love Being Here With You is another one of my favorite tracks on this CD. Bette Midler and Barry Manilow sound great singing together. The instruments playing on this track gives this song a nice big band feel. Bette sounds so flirtatious and seductive on the track Big Spender. I enjoyed this song very much. He's A Tramp is another highlight on this CD. I enjoyed the clarinet playing on this song, because it sounds so smooth and relaxed. I think it accompanies Bette's vocals perfectly. I loved the cozy romantic sentiment of the track The Folks on the Hill. This song is about being happy by just living the simple life with someone you love. I knew only one Peggy Lee song which was Fever when I bought this CD, but I enjoyed listening to the entire album.

Carrie Underwood is a talented singer with a bright future ahead of her. The CD single gives listeners a glimpse of what to expect in the future from the newest star on the music scene. Independence Day is a great song that addresses the social issue of domestic violence. It is about the extreme measures a woman goes through to escape her abusive relationship. I think this country tune is perfect for Carrie's powerful voice. Inside Your Heaven is a typical pop love tune lyrically, but I think Carrie makes up for it by displaying her incredible vocal range on this song. She sounds great on this track in my opinion.

I love this new CD from Amos Lee. The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud. This song really puts me in a great mood. His guitar playing is so energetic here. My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though. It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc. Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck. Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the charm of a girl from the south. Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one. Freedom is an interesting track. It is a reminder that the pursuit of freedom should not lead to violence. The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special. Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend. I love the feeling of loss and sense of hurt in Amos' voice on this track. Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer.

The Road is a sad and moving novel about being homeless and trying to survive. It is a novel about how a father does anything he can to keep himself and his son alive and fed. Often times, they go days without eating. Drinking clean water and eating apples is a rare luxury. Father and son sleep in empty houses, empty cars, and even on the beach. The two characters in the novel have very strong personalities, and this is one of the strong points of the novel. I enjoyed reading about the resourcefulness of the father and his determination to stay warm and survive in rainy and snowy weather. He made a lamp out of a beer bottle, a piece of curtain, some gasoline and some oil. The son in the novel is a very interesting character. He is a compassionate young boy who shares what little food he has with an old man that has no food. The Road is a very unique novel. I think the theme of being homeless and hungry is a subject some authors don't have the courage to write about. Anyone can be become homeless in any corner of the world, and I think that is a key message of the novel. This is the first novel I read where the characters are nameless. This novel is not divided into chapters like most books. I didn't it down until I finished it. There are other nameless homeless characters in this book, and Cormac McCarthy describes them in graphic detail. A homeless man is described as being struck by lightning with his hair all frizzy. Another homeless man in the book is missing both of his legs. The Road is a moving novel that reminds me to appreciate my home and the food that I am able to buy for my family.

Ratatouille is one of the best movies of the year. I love the story of the film, and I think it looks visually beautifully. I love the extras on the DVD especially the eleven minute documentary featuring Remy and Emile talking about rats in history. This was a very informative humorous feature. I also loved watching the deleted scenes that featured director Brad Bird talking about them. The deleted scenes are not in color, but that are still fun to watch. The animated short Lifted is included on the DVD. This is a funny animated short. I love this DVD.

Timeless is a very appropriate title for the this CD. Most of the singers who originally performed these songs like Johnny Cash and Don Gibson are long gone, but Martina proves that their music will never be forgotten. Every track is a timeless classic country song.I Never Promised You A Rose Garden is a great song about how every relationship has postive and negative aspects to it. The lyrics of this song are so relevant and timeless. I really enjoyed the song I Can't Stop Loving You. This song was originally performed by Don Gibson more than 50 years ago. Martina's voice conveys a sad but romantic sentiment on this song, and I loved it. There are very nice duets on this album. I really enjoyed the duet Martina sings with Dolly Parton entitled I Still Miss Someone, a song that was originally performed by Johnny Cash. These two great singers harmonize so well together. I can really hear a sense of loneliness and longing in their voices. I think Johnny would have been proud of their version. Martina's duet with Dwight Yoakam entitled Heartaches By The Number is an excellent song about being frustated with someone you love. I loved the violin playing on the track very much.Till I Can Make It On My Own is another one of my favorite songs on this CD. The piano playing by Gordon Mote is so pretty on this track. You Aint Woman Enough is another highlight track on this album. There is a feisty determination in Martina's voice here that is so good on this track. Love Gonna Live Here is a very hopeful song about being optimistic that you will find someone to love again after you've been hurt. Make The World Go Away is another classic country gem. Martina's voice sounds so romantic and dreamy on this song. I really liked the organ playing on this track.I really enjoyed listening to this CD. Martina is one of the biggest stars in country music. I think she sounds great, and so do all the musicians who perform on this album. I think the music on Timeless appeals to country music fans of all ages.

Carole King is one of the best singer songwriters of all time. She has a career that spans over 40 years, and I think that The Living Room Tour is a great record of her achievements. I envy anyone who had the chance to see her perform her music in concert last summer in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hyannis Massachusetts. Listening to this CD, I felt like Carole was actually singing for me in my living room.The first track is a new song entitled Welcome To My Living Room. It is a short cute track in which she sings about her love of performing music and entertaining people. Carole also sings a lovely new duet entitled Loving You Forever with a musician named Gary Burr. This is a very pretty love song. My favorite track is the So Far Away. I think is a beautiful song about missing someone you love. I also enjoyed the songs It's Too Late and I Feel The Earth Move. These songs are timeless classics that should be famillar to anyone who grew up in the 60's and 70's. Another track that stands out is Sweet Seasons. This is a great song about enjoying and accepting the ups and downs of life. I was surprised by the number of songs Carole wrote for other artists which are included here. Every musical artist from the 60s and 70s owes a little bit of their success to Carole King including Aretha Franklin. In fact, I think one of the highlights on this CD is a song that Aretha recorded entitled You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman. This is a very inspirational and uplifting song. Carole's performance of this song is so good.I really enjoyed the track The Locomotion. It is a great dance song that recorded by Little Eva and more recently performed by Kylie Minogue in the 80s. Her voice conveys so much warmth especially on the song You've Got A Friend which was recorded by James Taylor. The music of Carole King is timeless. The lyrics to most of her songs will stay with you forever. I recommend The Living Room Tour to anyone who enjoys soft rock music.

You are never too old to learn that is the message I got from reading this book. Mr Dawson knew about having pride, making sacrifices, and maintaning a sense of dignity. I found all these things to be inspiring. George Dawson raised 7 children who all graduated from college. Without being able to read, he helped his children with their homework by having them read their homework out loud to him. George Dawson left home at age 12 to work on a white man's farm to help out his struggling family. He knew the meaning of sacrifice at a early age. He refused to eat a bowl of stew simply because it was placed on the porch where the dogs ate. He made it clear that he was a human being and deserved to be treated with respect. Anything is possible even learning to read at 98. This is a wonderful book.

Fast Car is a song about never giving up on your dreams, and that is why I never get tired of listening to it. Tracy Chapman writes powerful songs with timeless themes and that is what makes this CD so good I really loved her delivery on Talking Bout A Revolution. It is very inspiring song about the problem of unemployment. Baby Can I Hold You is about how people have difficulty saying how they feel about each other. Across The Lines is about the hope for racial equality for all people. Mountains O things is about trying to find happiness with the things you have. This CD is a must in your collection.

Most of these Christmas songs have been performed by many different artists over the years. Sarah makes these songs her own though. She plays the guitar and piano with so much skill. Every note and every key sounds flawless. My favorite tracks are Wintersong and River. These are beautiful songs about missing a loved one at Christmas time. Sarah plays the piano so effortlessly. I like the tone of sadness in her voice on these songs. O Little Child of Bethlehem and What Child Is This are two other highlights on this disc. Sarah's voice sounds so spiritual on this track. Her guitar playing is a perfect compliment to her vocals. I'll Be Home For Christmas is a sweet romantic tune. I think Sarah sings this song well. Happy Christmas is another favorite of mine. This song is about a call for peace around the world. The choir sounds beautiful on this song. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas is a track that simply puts me in a relaxed and pleasant mood. Song For A Winter's Night is a track about how spending time with loved ones can be so special. I love this CD of Christmas songs.

I enjoyed the poems in this book very much. It is impossible to pick a favorite, because I loved them all. I really enjoy reading poems about different human experiences. Poetry 180 is filled with almost every human emotion.I loved the poem entitled Love Poem 1990. It is about a man falling in love at different stages in his life from childhood to old age and how he feels about it. Another one of my favorite poems is entitled May. It is about the painful experience of putting a dog to sleep. The Green One Over There is a wonderful but sad poem about the relationship between a sister and a brother. I could really relate to the way siblings compete as described in this poem. The subject matter of the poems in this book are diverse. I never knew a subject could evoke such emotion. One of these poems is entitled What Would I Do. It is an insightful poem about what a husband would do if his wife cheated on him. The Quest is a excellent poem about a mother's fear that her daughter will be hurt and the extent she would take to protect her.I was drawn to some of these poems because of the title. I loved the titles Vegetarian Physics, The Poem of Chalk, 1-800 Hot Ribs, and The Grammar Lesson. These are humorous and descriptive poems I could read over and over just for a laugh. My appreciation for poetry has increased so much. I loved this book.

Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon capture the spirit of the music of Johnny and June Carter Cash so well. They sound like they are having so much fun singing together on duets like Jackson and It Aint Me Babe. They also shine when they sing songs individually. Joaquin sounds great on tracks like Folsom Prison Blues, Ring of Fire, I Walk The Line, and Cocaine Blues. These are classic songs about love, regret and rebellion, and I think Joaquin performs these songs like a pro. Reese shines on the track Jukebox Blues. It is a very upbeat song with an old fashioned country sound. I also enjoyed Reese's performance of Wildwood Flower. There is a sincerity in her voice that is just so appealing. Her guitar playing is very good on this track. There are performances by other singers who also have act in the movie. My favorites are Tyler Hilton's version of Elvis Presley's That's Alright Mama and Waylon Payne's version of Jerry Lee Lewis song Lewis Boogie Blues. I think they capture the energy and spirit of the singers they portray excellently. I did not have to compare the songs on this CD with the original artists, because I think the music on this soundtrack is enjoyable and entertaining enough.

The life of a politician is very stressful according to Barack Obama, and I truly believe him. He is hopeful that America can be a place where all Americans can prosper, no matter what their dreams are. He is a father who loves to spend time with his wife and two daughters. His long legislative sessions sometimes force him to postpone vacations or miss a school function. Obama has been mistaken for a valet by white people outside of a restaurant. He has also been followed by security guards just because the color of his skin. Yet, he remains a politician who believes that all citizens can live in harmony regardless of their ethnic background. Barack's belief in partial birth abortion has drawn criticism and questions about his Christian faith from his former opponent in the Senate race Alan Keyes, nurses and newspaper writers. Barack grew up exposed to all different religions. By reading the Bible and the Koran as a child, he is a man with a respect for all religions. Obama supports many good ideas in my opinion. He supports affirmative action, a movement that gives all people from different minorities and individuals with disabilities equal opportunity in admissions to colleges and access to jobs in the work force. Obama believes that the United States government and political regardless of party, should strive to meet the needs of all citizens. Barack supports giving welfare benefits to legal immigrants and putting child locks on guns. Barack strongly believes that people who serve in public office should strive to perform their jobs with integrity. Obama believes that public servants should listen to the needs of the people they serve, and they be held accountable for personal involvement in scandals and mis use of tax payer money. Obama has made his share of mistakes along the way. He accidently pressed the wrong button and voted against a bill that protected children against sexual predators. He missed voting on an important bill about gun control, because he was on vacation. The Audacity of Hope is a honest inside look about how difficult the job of a politician really is. This book also gives the reader a clear picture of Barack's position on issues like values, family, politics and race. This book portrays Barack Obama as a very knowledgeable and compassionate person. He will make a fine President, because he listens to the needs of everyone.

KD Lang has a goregous voice that was missing on 1997's Drag, but it is clearly evident on this new CD. Summerfling is a lighthearted song with a cool retro melody to it. It is a whimsical and enjoyable song. Extraordinary thing is an excellent high tempo song about how meeting someone so special can change your whole outlook on life. She makes infatuation and basking in the sun sound sexy in the sensual song Curiousity. The Consequences of Falling is about a seductive song about hoping that the person you are in the love with feels the same way. This is KD's Lang best effort in years.

I loved listening to this CD. The music from Broadway's best loved musicals are on this album. I recogized most of these songs, even though I've only seen a few of them on the local stage. I have so many favorites on this CD. It is hard to pick one. I'm a big fan of Barbara Streisand. I loved her performance of People from Funny Girl. Memory is the hit song from the musical Cats. Betty Buckley's performance of this song is so emotional and sincere.I loved the song Annie. It is a wonderfully optimistic song performed by the original Annie Andrea McArdle. Another highlight for me is the song One performed by the cast of a Chorus Line. Luck Be A Lady Tonight is another of my favorite broadway songs on this CD from Guys and Dolls. The music of the night is a beautiful song by Michael Crawford from Phantom of the Opera. Richard Kiley has such a strong and powerful voice. He sounds so inspirational singing The Impossible Dream from Man from La Mancha. My dream is to see some musicals on Broadway someday and listen to these songs performed live.I'm surprised that there isn't any music from Miss Saigon or Jesus Christ Superstar included here. I think they are classic musicals with great songs Maybe they will appear on a future compilation from PBS.

A Million Little Pieces is a gripping account of the 6 weeks James Frey spent in a treatment center in Minnesota for his addiction to alcohol and other drugs. The abuse of drugs can really ruin the body. There is a very descriptive part in the book where Frey describes the painful experience he endured having several root canals done without anethesia to repair his damaged teeth. The abuse of drugs can also damage the relationship a person has with their family. One of the more moving parts of this book is where Frey confronts his parents in counseling to tell them about his drug use and drug dealing.They are heartbroken to hear about all the bad things their son has done, and they become closer as a result of his confession. This is a bit predictable, but it is still really moving to read. I also think that Frey is very brutally honest as he describes a constant craving for alcohol and drugs while in rehab.Every patient at the treatment center has a job to perform, and I really reading how Frey's jobs changed while he was there. He cleaned toilets in the beginning, and then he switched to making coffee. He finally became a greeter in his last days. Frey spends a lot of time describes the friendships he made while in the treatment center. Having other people around him who were struggling with the same addictions helped James get better. I thought it was interesting that one of the patients and one of James' friends at the rehab center was a judge. I really enjoyed reading about his friendship with a crime boss named Leonard who kept him in the program. James Frey's romantic relationship with a woman named Lilly who suffered from sexual and drug abuse was very sweet.I think the message of A Million Little Pieces is that a person can overcome their addiction to alcohol and drugs if they have people who can support them, and if they are willing and determined enough. I enjoyed reading this book very much.

I love this new CD from Suzanne Vega. She is such a talented musician and songwriter. This new album is proof of that. My favorite track is "New York Is A Woman." This is a beautiful song about the allure and romance of New York. "Zephyr and I" is another highlight on this disc. This is a great song about friendship. I love the beat of the song very much. "Ludlow Street" is a tribute song to the place where musicians get together to perform in Manhattan. "Frank and Ava" is a reference to the difficult relationship between Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. This track has a nice retro sound. "Unbound" is a groovy track to dance to. I like this song vey much. "Pornographer's Dream" is an interesting song title. Suzanne's vocals are very soothing on this track. As You Are Now is an excellent song about enjoying all the little subtle things about a person The violin playing on this track is very pretty. I love all the tracks on this album.

Brendan Fraser is a scientist looking for the center of the earth in this entertaining film. Josh Hutcherson is a fine young actor who is really good in this movie. Anita Briem is a talented lovely actress. I have never heard of her before, but she gives a good performance as a mountain guide. The visual effects are excellent. This movie is a treat to watch in 3D. I love the floating rocks and the furious flying fish in the movie.I really liked the special features on this DVD. It features a commentary on every scene of the movie with Brendan Fraser and the director Eric Brevig. This DVD also features an interview with Josh Hutcherson about his life as a young actor. There are some fun games to play based on the movie included in this DVD too. There is another documentary talking the history of scientific discovery on this DVD. This is also interesting to watch. I really enjoyed watching the movie and checking out all the special features.

Tron Legacy is a visually dazzling movie with excellent music and an easy to follow plot. I recommend the movie for these reasons. Jeff Bridges reprises his role as Kevin Flynn. He also plays the evil Clu. Clu is a computer program that looks exactly It is interesting to see Jeff Bridges play both characters. The plot is simple. Flynn has been trapped in a digital world for twenty plus years. He has a son named Sam who finds his long lost father and tries to get him out of this virtual world. I love the visual effects of the movie. The light cycle races are neat to watch and so is the light jet. Another scene that I liked watching involved Garrett Hedhund being stripped of his clothes with one finger and instantly clad in a black body suit. I also love watching the light disc battles in the film. Daft Punk is a music group that scores the film. They provide the movie with a pulsating techno sound that I like very much. There are also classic songs by Journey and The Eurythmics played in the movie too. These songs still sound great The lovely actress Olivia Wilde plays Quorra. She is the surrogate daughter of Kevin Flynn. She also becomes Sam's ally as through the digital world. Tron Legacy is an entertaining two hours at the movies.

Wilson Phillips are back after a decade since their last album. They do a wonderful job covering pop classics from the 60's and 70's. Monday Monday is a hip updated version of the Mamas and Papas hit. Chynna also delivers a sassy sexy cover of Your No Good that would make Linda Ronstadt proud. Their cover of Doctor My Eyes is so good too. I could not help but tap my feet to this song. It is one of my favorites on this album. Wendy's voice sounds very sensual and smooth on Joni Mitchell's California. I loved Wilson Phillips cover of Turn! Turn! Turn so much. Their voices sound so sexy together on this song. I think that this is the best song on this CD by far. Already Gone is an excellent cover. I think Wilson Phillips' version sounds better than the original by the Eagles to be honest. Dance, Dance, Dance is a perfect song for summer. It really makes you want to dance. I love Carnie's version of Old Man. Her voice has so much warmth and sensitivity on this track. I loved Wilson Phillips' CD California.

I read this book over the hollidays, and I couldn't put it down. This is an unique book about a young man who raises his little brother after losing his parents to cancer so suddenly. Eggers talks about having an alcoholic father he hardly knew. He recounts the emotional experience of scattering his mother's ashes in Lake Michigan. He writes about struggling to have a social life while raising his brother like how guilty he feels leaving his brother with a sitter for the first time. He does all parental things like cooking and going to his brother's open house at school. He recounts the trials and tribulations of being an editor for a fledging 20 something magazine called Might. He writes about his friends and his childhood in vivid detail like the young woman who comes out of a coma after falling from a building. Eggers talks about another friend who attempts to commit suicide by shallowing a bottle of pills. This is a very entertaining book by a talented new writer.

I love the voice of Jennifer Warnes. She takes these songs by Leonard Cohen, and she makes these songs her own. "First We Take Manhattan" is my favorite cut. I love the guitar playing by the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan here. "Famous Blue Raincoat" is a song that sounds like a love letter between two people who are apart from each other. I love the saxophone playing on this track. "Song of Bernadette" is a lovely track. The piano playing accompanies Jennifer's vocals well here. "Aint No Cure For Love" is a very pretty song with a romantic tone. "Joan of Arc" is an interesting song about the thoughts and feelings of this historic figure. I love the beat of this song very much. Jennifer Warnes sounds so melodic and crisp throughout this disc. I really enjoyed listening to this CD.

I consider Dangerous to be Michael Jackson's last great album. This album has it all. It has excellent dance songs like "Remember The Time", "Jam", "In The Closet" and the title track. This album has uplifting songs like Heal The World and Will You Be There. I love the edgy sensual song "Give In To Me". This album has touching tracks like "Black Or White" and the prophetic "Gone Too Soon". I love this album.

Pay the Devil is Van's best work in years. This CD has a great old fashioned country sound to it. The title track is a beautiful song about someone who is lost and trying to find their way through life. But, my favorite track is There Stands The Glass. This is a song about how alcohol helps some people forget their troubles. Half As Much and There's a Hole in My Bucket are both gems on this album. I love all the instruments playing together on this track especially the piano and steel guitar. Your Cheating Heart is another one of my favorites. This is a classic song about a person who has been unfaithful to their partner. Big Blue Diamonds is a very good song about how a wealthy person would trade her riches for true love. Back Street Affair is an excellent song about a love between shared between two people that no body seems to understand and approve of. Van is accompanied nicely by Geraint Watkins on the piano on this track. Till I Gain Control Again is a very good song about a person who is honest about his mistakes and who is trying to make amends with the one he loves. I really enjoyed listening to this CD.

Paul McCartney continues to write songs that are meaningful. As a musician, he understands that chaos and confusion is a part of the process of creating music. My favorite song on this album is English Tea. This is a very pleasant sounding song about enjoying one of the simple pleasures in life. Fine Line is another hit on this album. This is an upbeat song about how people each choose their own path in life. A Certain Softness is another highlight track on this album. It is about how a man can become so captivated by the subtle qualities of a woman like the softness in her eyes and the sadness in her smile. How Kind Of You is a good song about how the thoughtfulness of a friend can make such a big differences in our lives.Jenny Wren is a sad and beautiful song about the effect that loneliness and poverty can have on a young girl. Too Much Rain is an excellent song about how pain and hardship are a part of life. Paul sings so eloquently in this song that life always moves on and we should not dwell on the pain for too long. Paul sounds good on the acoustic guitar, and his vocals are clear and so melodic here. This Has Never Happened Before is a very happy song about what it feels like to fall in love for the first time. At The Mercy is a song about we can feel overwhelmed by the the demands of life and the people we love. There is a sense of anixety in Paul's voice on this song. Follow Me is a beautiful love song about how someone we love gives us a sense of purpose and direction in life. I enjoyed listening to the music on this CD very much.

Michael Buble's voice is so laid back and soothing. I love this CD, even though it only has six tracks on it. The live version of Let Me Snow sounds cool and jazzy. I love all the instruments featured on this track. I also love the piano playing on "I'll Be Home For Christmas." Grown Up Christmas List is a romantic wistful track. The standards "White Christmas" and The "Christmas song". put me in such a good mood.

Prince sounds great here. "Planet Earth" is Prince's song about taking care of the earth. The piano playing is pretty good here. "Guitar" is an excellent rock song that shows off his skill as a guitarist. "Somewhere on Earth", "Future Baby Mama", and "Mr Goodnight" are such smooth sexy tracks. I love them very much. "Chelsea Rodgers" is a funky disco track with a nice retro sound. "The One You Wanna C" is an upbeat track that gets me moving. "All The Midnights In The World" is probably the most melodic track on the disc. "Lion of Judah" is Prince's song about living life in the public eye. It is a very personal song. I enjoyed every track on this disc, and I highly recommend it.

I love this CD. Leeann Rimes has always had a great voice, but the lyrics in her songs are more mature now. All of the songs on This Woman are awesome. My favorite track on this album is Probably Wouldn't Be This Way. It is a beautiful song about moving on with your life after someone you love dies. Leeann sings this song with such feeling and emotion. I love this song. Something's Gotta Give is an excellent song about waiting and hoping for the right person to come into your life. I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics of this song. I also like the song I Want To with You. This is a very fun song that Leeann sings with a lot of energy. Some People is a very pretty song about feeling so fortunate about having someone in your life you can love and trust. You Take Me Home is another standout song on this CD. This track is about how someone can make you feel so comfortable and at home. Leeann sounds great on this woman. I highly recommend this CD.

I enjoyed reading this book very much. It is filled with stories about interesting people who have lived incredible lives Neenah Ellis is a journalist who spent an unforgettable year travelling the country listening to the stories of people who have reached the age of 100 and beyond for a National Public Radio series. I truly believe now that the secret to a long happy life is to stay active either mentally or physically. The people in this book can all attest to that. This book profiles educators like Margaret Rawson who published a book about dyslexia and her work in the field at the age of 96. Abraham Goldstein is a dedicated professor who has taught law for 70 years. I loved the story of Anna Wilmot who stayed active by paddling a rowboat and going skinny dipping.I also enjoyed the story of Ruth Ellis who was the oldest black lesbian. She was an accomplished public speaker and gay activist who made 100 appearances in a 1 year speaking on college campuses and gay functions all over the country. Ruth Ellis achievements have not gone unnoticed as a film has been made about her life. The story of Louisiana Hines is interesting because her grandfather was a slave. She can vividly recall how blacks were lynched for preaching about equality in the early years of the 20th century.Roy Stamper became a successful horse trainer He also developed a love for preaching despite having only 4 years of formal education. Roy Stamper proved that it is never too late to fall in love, because he got married at the age of 101.Sadie and Gilbert Hill were married for an amazing 81 years. The secret to their long marriage can be summed up in one word together. They did everything together from cooking to shopping to dancing. This couple even worked together as farm caretakers milking cows and herding cattle. I loved the story of Harry Shapiro whose life has been prolonged and enriched by his passion to paint. If I live to be 100 is a wonderful book.

Shrek 2 is a fun soundtrack. This CD has a good variety of songs that are all enjoyable to listen to. I love the track Accidently In Love by the Counting Crows. It is a great playful song, and it is one of their best in a long time. I also enjoyed the duet by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas Livin La Vida Loca. It is a very funny version of the Ricky Martin hit. I think their voices sound pretty good together too. Butterfly Boucher does a great job singing the David Bowie classic Changes. Her version sounds more upbeat than the original to be honest. Little Drop of Poison is a good song to do tango dance to. Funkytown is a good classic dance song and a nice addition to this soundtrack. I love Jennifer Saunder's voice. Her delivery on the song Holding Out for a Hero is so great. People Aint No good by Nick Cave is a pleasant song to listen to. His deep voice sounds sexy. Shrek 2 has a great variety of songs on it. I enjoyed it very much.

The Chronicles Of Narnia- The Voyage Of Dawn Treader is a good movie but not a great one. It is actually the third book of CS Lewis Narnia series of books that has been made into a movie. The first was The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe and the second was Prince Caspian from a couple of years ago. Michael Apted directs this third film. There are some shots in this movie that are absolutely incredible.The visual aspect of the film is the strongest thing about it. There is a scene where our young heroes are transported to Narnia via a portrait of the ocean on the wall in their bedroom. This scene is neat to look at. There is another scene that involves a fire breathing dragon being turned back into a boy. There is another scene with Georgie Henley, She makes it start snowing after reading a spell from a book.Georgie Henley shows promise as an actress in her role as Lucy. She is a young teenager now. She struggles to love and accept herself in the movie. This is an interesting theme of the picture. Ben Barnes returns as captain of the dawn treader and newcomer Will Poulter has his moments as cousin Eustace. The casting of this movie is not the problem. The problem is the lack of drama in the picture. I never felt our heroes were in any sense of danger or dread. There is a battle with a sea serpent, but that is about it. I realize that the movie follows the plot of the book, so I wasn't expecting that much physical conflict. I still feel that this picture lacked a sense of drama though.

I really enjoyed listening to this CD from Alison Krauss. My favorite track on this CD is the duet "Missing You" with John Waite. This is a classic song from the 80's, and it is interesting to hear it sung by two people. "Down By The River to Pray" is a gospel song. It is from the movie O Brother Where Art Thou from a few years ago. This song is very uplifting and one of my favorites on this CD. Alison has such a clear strong tone to her voice on the track "You're Just A Country Boy." The piano playing on this track is very pretty. "Simple Love" is a track that celebrates the simple life of a working man. "Whiskey Lullaby" is a sad but very touching duet with Brad Paisley. This is a song about how alcohol can ruin a person's life. "How's The World Treating You" is a beautiful duet with James Taylor. I love the violin playing on this track. "Sawing on the Strings" is an upbeat track. I love the tempo and the banjo playing on this song very much. The music on this CD is very enjoyable and entertaining.

Marley and Me is an excellent memoir about a family's love for their beloved labrador retriever named Marley. Most of this book is set in South Florida where Grogan was employed as a newspaper columnist. I didn't know South Florida was such a hot bed for murder as Grogan describes.I think that a dog is truly a man's best friend, because it is there to celebrate with in the good times, and a dog is always there to console you in the bad times. This is a theme and message in the book that Grogan communicates well. He also gives some interesting information about labradors like the power of their wagging tail, their love of water and swimming, and their huge appetite to consume anything they see.Grogan writes about the experience of his wife's miscarriage early in their marriage. He also shares and how Marley became a source of comfort to help them ease their pain. There is another touching chapter in the book where a teenager in a South Florida neighborhood is stabbed. Marley becomes like a protective watch dog for her and a source of peace. Grogan describes his dog as being the most worst behaved dog in the world. He backs up his claim by sharing some of Marley's unbelievable antics. One episode in the book that sticks out is where Grogan feeds Marley mangos to retrieve a gold chain that he has swallowed. I was chuckling to myself when I read this part of the book. I also enjoyed reading the chapter entitled The Audition in which Grogan writes about his dog's fun experience of being in a movie. I could really identify with the feelings that Grogan shares in this memoir about his dog getting older and weaker, because my dog also recently died. Marley and Me is one of the best books I've read about dogs and friendship in a long time. It made me laugh and cry and not many books do that.

This is a very comprehensive book about the history of some of the world's most popular drinks like beer, wine, coffee, tea, rum and coca cola. Tom Standage did a lot of research for this book. He went to San Francisco to gather information about beer. He went as far as France to get information about wine.I was surprised to learn that the workers who built the pyramids in Egypt were paid in beer for their labor. I also learned that beer was invented as a result of farming in ancient times. I also learned that coffee was first invented in the Arab country of Yemen. I enjoyed reading coffee became popular throughout the world and how it was enjoyed by scientists Issac Newton and Edmund Halley. Coffee is enjoyed by people in all different professions, and it was fascinating to read how coffee's popularity spread so quickly. I learned that coca cola was first sold to treat ailments like head and stomach aches. I also discovered that early versions of coca cola had traces of cocaine in it. I enjoyed reading about how tea became so popular in England. There is an additional chapter in the book about the importance and popularity of water in the world today. A History of The World in 6 Glasses is an informative and entertaining book about the drinks people quench their thirst with.

This is a very good soundtrack with a variety of songs. Touched By An Angel is a beautiful song by Stevie Nicks. The message of this song and movie for that matter is that life can truly be a celebration of love and friendship if we really want it. This song is worth the price of their entire CD. There are other good songs on here though. Enya's instrumental contribution Only Time is really pretty. The Consequences of Falling by KD Lang is about the doubts of entering into a new relationship. This song fits it in the movie well. I enjoyed the energetic song Baby Work Out by Jackie Wilson. Paula Cole and Dolly Parton's voices blend very well together on the song Heart Door. This is an excellent soundtrack.

I'm a big Sheryl Crow fan, and I loved this CD. The title track is about how the beauty of nature can bring us peace of mind and serenity in our lives. It is a slow paced song, but Sheryl's vocals are sweet and clear as always. My favorite track on this album is Live It Up. It has the same feel as one of Sheryl's biggest hits Soak Up The Sun. This is a fun song about how we should live life to the fullest, because it is short and precious. Sheryl sounds good playing on the guitar and singing vocals on the first single Good is Good. This song is definitely one of the highlights on this album. This song is about thinking that the good times in life have passed you by. This tune is also about feeling confused about what direction to take in life. Letter To God is an interesting song about thinking about what happens to you when you die. There is a spiritual depth and curious quality in Sheryl's voice on this song that I liked. I Know Why is another gem on this album. It is a very pretty song about no one is immune from getting lonely. The song Always On Your Side is probably a song Sheryl wrote for her boyfriend Lance Armstrong telling him that she will always be there to support him. The piano playing on this track is beautiful. The Perfect Lie is a hightlight song on here about how people try to hide and lie about how they feel when they are in an abusive relationship with someone. There is an empathy in Sheryl's vocals that makes you believe that she knows what she is talking about on this song.I like the sound of the song Where Has All The Love Gone. It is a pretty song about wondering how some people can become so unaffected by all the bad news in the world today. I can hear all the instruments on this track, and I think they compliment Sheryl's vocals well especially the drums. Lifetimes is a nice song about loving someone unconditionally. I like the loyal sentiment of this song very much. Wildflowers sounds pretty good to me, and I would recommend it to anyone.

Eric Idol and John Du Prez bring the story of the search for the Holy Grail to the Broadway stage. I really enjoyed this listening to this album. All of the cast members give excellent performances in their roles. The soundtrack not only provides the lyrics these songs, but it also describes what happens on stage when these songs are performed. I felt like I was actually watching the show just listening to this CD.David Hyde Pierce sings a very great song entitled You Won't Succeed on Broadway. This is a very funny song in which he sings that you can't succeed on Broadway if you don't have any Jews. Hank Azaria lends his talents here in his role as Lancerlot. His name is Lancerlot is a very upbeat dance number and one of my favorites. I enjoyed the track Laker Girls Cheer. It sounds very funny. I also liked the song Always Look on The Bright Side of Life. This is a happy song performed by Tim Curry who plays King Arthur. This is a kind of song you would sing to a friend just to cheer them up.Sara Ramirez is such a great singer. She performs on several numbers on this soundtrack in her role as Lady Of The Lake. My favorite is Find Your Grail. This song shows off Sara's powerful voice. It is a song about letting nothing stop you from achieving your goal. Sara also sings a song with Christopher Sieber who plays Sir Gallahad entitled The Song That Goes Like This. This song is romantic and funny at the same time. I really enjoyed this track. This soundtrack is excellent. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music or anyone who needs a laugh. I hope to see Spamalot on Broadway in the near future.

Based on these two tracks, I think Taylor will have a bright future. The track Do I Make You Proud is dedicated to the fans who supported him and voted him as the American Idol. This song also applies to anyone who has achieved their goals in life. I loved this track. Taking It to The Streets is a classic song about a person who doesn't give up hope despite living on the street. Taylor sings this song with a lot of energy and effort. It is not as smooth vocally as Do I Make You Proud, but it is an unique version that some people will enjoy. I predict Taylor will be successful if he continues to perform songs that have a personal meaning to him like Do I Make You Proud.

This is an excellent soundtrack to one of the best movies of the year. Ray Charles left behind a legacy of great music. Some of his biggest hits are included on this soundtrack. My favorite track is Georgia on My Mind. This is Ray Charles' signature song. It is also the state song of Georgia.I Can't Stop Loving You is another classic Ray Charles tune. This is a very pretty song. Ray sounds great vocally and on the piano on this track. I Got A Woman is another highlight track for me. It is a beautiful song about appreciating all the things a good woman can do in your life. I really liked this song. Another track that stands out for me on this album is the song Hallelujah I Love Her So. This is a very lively, energetic song. It is part soul and part gospel and I really enjoyed it.I've heard a few of these songs before, and I did not know that Ray Charles was credited for writing and singing them. Hit the Road Jack is a great song to sing at parties that I have heard for years. I was surprised to find out that Ray Charles sang this song when I bought this CD. Bye Bye Love is a song also performed by the Everly Brothers in a slow sweet pop sound in the late 50s. Ray Charles sings the same song, but he gives it a nice soulful sound here. I loved this track.Ray is an excellent soundtrack of wonderful music This CD just put me in a good mood. I think the music of Ray Charles appeals to every fan, because his voice is so touching and emotionally powerful. I highly recommend this soundtrack.

Some Hearts is an excellent debut album from Carrie Underwood. Every track on this CD sounds so good. The title track is an upbeat song about some people get lucky in love. My favorite track is Jesus Take The Wheel. This is a standout song about putting your life in Jesus' hands. I really liked the song. I'm not a particularly religious person, but I enjoyed it. I think Carrie sounds great here. I Aint In Checotah Anymore is another highlight on this album. This is a song about how quickly Carrie's life has changed since she became famous, and yet she remains a modest and humble person. I Can't Live A Lie is a very good song about how two people drift apart in a relationship. Carrie's vocals are very touching here. Before He Cheats is another one of my favorite tracks. This is a song about all the thoughts that go through a woman's mind when she suspects her boyfriend is cheating on her. I love the song Wasted a lot too. This is an awesome song. It is a reminder that we should try to live our lives with no regrets. Don't Forget To Remember Me is a very pretty song about how much Carrie loves and misses her family. The Night Before Life Goes On is a good song about growing up and beginning your life as an adult. I think this is a song that everybody can relate to. I really enjoyed listening to this CD, and I recommend it to anyone.

The Real Thing is an excellent debut CD by Bo Bice. He is such a talented singer with a bright future ahead of him. The title track is about how hard it is trying to make a relationship work and trying to get your priorities straight. My favorite track on this album is It's My Life though. This is an excellent song about how everyone including Bo is trying to find their own answers and make the right decisions in life. Another highlight for me is the song You're Everything. This is a rock and roll love song written by Chad Kroeger of Nickleback. This tune is about how a person would do anything for someone they love. I also enjoyed the song Willing to Try. This song was written by Richie Sanbora of the group Bon Jovi. It is about a person trying to hold on to a relationship. The song U Make Me Better is another one of my favorites on this CD. This is another song about trying to hold on to a relationship. The highlight and difference on this track is the fantastic passionate guitar playing. I loved this song. I really liked Bo's vocal performance on this song Nothing Without You. This is a great song about how life can be so empty without having someone to love. Valley Of Angels is a very touching and beautiful song about trying to find peace of mind. This song is very relaxing, and I really liked it. The Real Thing is an excellent debut by Bo Bice. I loved it.

This CD is filled with great classic songs from the Queen of Rock and Roll of the late 70's and early 80s. Stevie Nicks has always had a sexy voice. I love her duets on this CD with Tom Petty and Don Henley which are Stop Dragging My Heart Around and Leather and Lace respectively. I wonder why Stevie's duet with Kenny Loggins Whenever I Call you Friend is not included here. Most of Stevie's hits are included here like Stand Back, I Can't Wait, and If Anyone Falls. Timespace brings back a lot of memories from my preteen and teenage years. I enjoyed it very much.

The King's Speech is easily one of the best movies I have seen this year. It is the true story of how Duke of York overcomes his stammering problem with the help of a speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Colin Firth portrays Bertie, also known as the Duke of York. He becomes King George VI after his older brother is not fit to be the king of England. Geoffrey Rush plays Logue. Both men give Oscar worthy performances. The film is set in England in the mid to late 1930s. These are years leading up to World War II.The heart of the movie is how the relationship between the Bertie and Lionel Logue develop during the movie. Bertie is apprehensive of Logue's ability to help him with his sppech problem at first. Much of the humor of the film lies in the methods that Logue uses to help Bertie to overcome his stammering problems. He encourages Bertie to sing songs and recite tougue twisters to improve the fluency in his speech. This film shows the personal struggle of a British monarch that I knew nothing about.Michael Gambon costars Bertie's father King George V. England is in need of a king that can inspire confidence in people. Michael Gambon conveys this well in the few scenes that he appears in He is an actor with a strong on screen presence. Helena Bonham Carter is also very good as Bertie's supportive wife Elizabeth.The music adds so much to the film. French composer scores the film and provides the movie. I listened to the soundtrack after I watched the movie. My favorite music in the film is a piece entitled the Rehearsal. The piano playing is beautiful. This track is light and breezy. There are also somber instrumental pieces of music in the movie as well. This film includes uplifting classical pieces like Beethoven's Emperor concerto that I love.The King's Speech is an excellent film. It contains very funny moments between the two stars of the movie. It is also superbly scored by composer Alexandre Desplant. It shows the personal struggles of a British monarch not too many people in America know about. The King's speech proves that biopics can be entertaining and humorous.

I enjoyed watching the Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg. The actors inhabit the characters they play on screen. I forgot I was watching two actors, and I was immediately drawn into the llives of brothers Mikey and Dicky Eklund. Christian Bale co stars as Dicky. He is the older brother and trainer of boxer Mikey Ward. Bale's performance as a crack cocaine addict is convincing. He is a person who is trying to clean up his life and train his brother in boxing at the same time. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie involves Dicky listening to one of his brother's fights on the telephone. The boxing scenes are good. Even though I knew the outcome of the fights being a boxing fan, it was still fun to see Mark Wahlberg throw punches. Boxing is not just a physical sport. It is also a mental sport that involves mental will power and strategy. The scenes between Wahlberg and Bale convey this very well. Amy Adams is also very good as Charlene. She plays Micky's love interest. I like how their relationship develops in the movie. Charlene is not easily accepted by the members of Dicky's family. His family includes his mother Alice. She is played well by Melissa Leo. She is a woman who is trying to support her two sons at different stages Dicky also has many sisters in the film. They don't seem to do anything but sit on the couch and smoke cigarettes. The strength of the film are the performances by Wahlberg, Bale Adams and Melissa Leo, so these minor characters are okay.This film features the song "Here We Go Again" by Whitesnake. This is a great song but it is not included on the soundtrack. This is a minor disappointment. The instrumental music played at the end of the movie is upbeat, but that is about all I can say about the music. The Fighter is an entertaining film with excellent acting performances. It lacks memorable music that would make this film perfect.

Rob Garza and Eric Hilton stretch the boundaries of music on their latest effort Cosmic Game. The guys get some help from artists from different backgrounds. The result is a very pleasant album. David Byrne lends his musical talents on the track The Heart is A Lonely Hunter. This is also the title of a classic book. Bryne still has a wonderful quirky sounding voice on this song. I liked the reference to spaceships in this track and the theme of exploration. I also love the track Amerimacka featuring Jamerican singer Notch. It is a nice soulful track about a beautiful woman who has a hard life. Pela Janela is a sensual sounding Brazilian influenced track. I think this track is about stalking someone and the dark side of love. There is another Latin flavor on the track Ambicion Eterna which sounds really lively. There is a track with an awesome reggae beat entitled Wires and Watchtowers that is really excellent too. The Time We Lost Out Way is a very smooth laid back song featuring LouLou. I love the horns playing on this track. The sitar is an unique sounding instrument. I admire Thievery Corporation for exploring the beauty of it. I loved the track Doors of Perception featuring Gunjan. The sitar playing just hypnotizes you on this song. I really liked it. Cosmic Game takes you on a musical trip around the world and beyond. This is a very creative and ambitious CD from Thievery Corporation.

Lou Rawls set the standard for every crooner of R and B love songs. There will always be people falling and out of love, so there will always be people who can relate to the music of Lou Rawls. My favorite track is the classic You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine. Lady Love is another highlight here. It is one of those songs that just makes you feel good. Love Is A Hurtin Thing is another great track. This is a song about the pain of a lost love. I enjoyed Lou's rendition of the song Unforgettable. The piano playing on this track compliments Lou's silky smooth voice nicely. At Last is a beautiful duet with Dianne Reeves. It is one of my favorite tracks, because it is so romantic. Lou's voice is so sensual and soothing on the track Be Anything But Mine. His voice conveys what it really feels like to yearn for love on this song. I enjoyed listening to this CD very much.

This is a very good CD. Alanis sounds great on most of these tracks. I almost forgot the lyrics when listening to it at first. The first single Hands Clean sounds really good. It is a song about the violation of a minor. Hands Clean is also about trying to get on with one's life after that. I loved the song 21 things I want in a Lover. It is a very brash and honest tune that reminds me of the song You Oughta Know. It makes me rethink of the qualities I seek in a lover. So Unsexy is a great ballad about how we can allow a person to make us feel so unsexy and insignificant. At that particular time is a good song about the different stages in a relationship. It is a song that reminds us that we need to take time out to evaluate the direction of our relationships. Under Rug Swept is the best CD of 2002 so far.

I really enjoyed listening to this cast recording of Jersey Boys. The first track is entitled Ces Soirees la. This is a very fun upbeat opening track. The Early Years medley track is also very good. I love John Lloyd Young's falsetto vocals on tracks like Sherry and Big Girls Don't Cry. He is perfectly cast as music legend Frankie Valli. Walk Like A Man and Rag Doll are two highlights on this CD too. I also enjoyed the track Oh What a Night. I think J. Robert Spencer provides excellent vocals on this track. He is perfectly cast as bass singer Nick Massi. Another highlight on this CD for me is the track My Eyes Adored You. I also enjoyed the song Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You. These songs are very romantic and sweet. I hope to have the opportunity to see Jersey Boys on Broadway someday.

I was amazed by every exploit from every dog in this book. I was impressed by Bruno the German Shepherd who has assisted and protected his partner who is a police officer on 800 arrests half involving dangerous felons. This same dog has found 9 lost children 3 of whom no one else could track. I loved the story of Willie the golden retriever who predicts epileptic seizures and protects his owner from harm. This dog was trained to operate a footpad telephone in case of an emergency This incredible dog will even bark to remind his owner to take her medicine. I liked the story of AJ the bloodhound and Rachel the pet detectives. AJ is a former police dog who found a missing Alzheimer's patient, rescued a lost hiker and earned an award for saving the life of suicidal man. AJ is now teamed up with Rachel a Weimaraner a dog who searched for cadaver and body parts. She uses her sniffing skills to help AJ locate missing pets. I enjoyed the story of Mas the Newfoundland who can swim a mile to a drowning person and tow them to safety. This dog is strong enough to pull a sailboat filled with people to safety. There are other dogs in this book like Endal a Labrador retriever who assists a man in a wheelchair by doing everything from reminding him to look both ways when crossing the street to retrieving socks, groceries and even money. You will enjoy the stories in this book even if you don't own a dog.

Dylan's blend of blues and folk music may not appeal to everyone, but I think he sounds very good. Rollin and Tumblin and Thunder On The Mountain are my two favorite songs here. They sound so upbeat, and I enjoyed them very much. Beyond The Horizon and Aint Talkin are two very spiritual songs about having faith in a higher power and the after life. This is a very pretty song. When The Deal Goes Down is a track about remaining loyal to a friend when times are tough. Nettie Moore is a good song about a drifter who plays in a cowboy band. It is a song with a deep beat I think Working Man's Blues and Someday Baby are two tracks that prove that Dylan is a skilled blues guitarist. Spirit on The Water is a beautiful song about how friendship can turn into love. The Levee's Gonna Break is a highlight track about someone getting out of prison trying to start a new life. This song is about how difficult the readjustment process can be for someone in that situation. Dylan's latest musical effort is one of his best.

Willowbrook is a moving documentary about the lives of adults who are mentally disabled. I have never heard of the Staten Island, New York school before watching this documentary. I am shocked that thousands of people lived in such deplorable conditions for decades. Reporter Geraldo Rivera first exposed Willowbrook as an overcrowded and understaffed facility in 1972. The school closed in 1987, and some of the former residents have gone on to live productive lives. The message of this documentary is that people with mental disabilities should be given the change to reach their potential, no matter what that is. I am touched by the story of Benard Carabello. He was diagnosed with mental retardation when he actually has cerebral palsy. He now leads a full active life as a disability advocate. I am also touched by the story of the late Luis Rivera. This young man did not have the ability to communicate verbally, but he communicated such warmth and love through his smile and facial gestures. This documentary definitely increases my compassion for people with disabilities.

This is a fun soundtrack. Most of the tracks are performed by Hugh Grant. I didn't know he could sing so well. My favorite track is Don't Write Me Off. This track shows off his talent as a singer and his skills on the piano. Way Back Into Love is another highlight on this soundtrack. Hugh performs this song as a duet two times on this CD with different partners, and they both sound very good to me. Pop Goes My Heart is an upbeat tune that gets me moving. Meaningless Kiss and Dance With Me Tonight are two other tracks that stand out. Hugh's voice has a romantic quality on these songs. Haley Bennett is the other surprise on this soundtrack. The songs Buddha's Delight and Entering Booty Town are very sensual. Music and Lyrics is the best movie soundtrack of 2007 so far.

I bought Countryman because of the first single The Harder They Come. Willie Nelson sounds great on this track playing his acoustic guitar. This song is about fighting for what you believe in and staying true to yourself. I enjoyed the harmonica playing in the background on this track too.Another standout track is the song Sitting In Limbo. This song is about the universal theme of feeling uncertain about what to do with your life. This song is about having hope and faith that you will find your own path. Willie takes a country song by Johnny Cash and gives a nice reggae sound. I'm a Worried Man is definitely a highlight on this album. It is a fun duet that Willie sings with a musician named Tools Hibbert. This song just makes me happy every time I listen to it.The rest of the songs on the album are about falling in and out of love with someone. One in A Row is a song that stands out for me. This is song about wishing that the person you love can be honest with you just for once and stop lying. I really liked the steel guitar playing on this song. It really accompanies Willie's vocals perfectly. Undo The Right is a song about what it feels like to be cheated on by your partner This tune is about feeling that the relationship is still worth saving. Something To Talk About is a song about someone who has the reputation as a heartbreaker who doesn't seem to care about a person's feelings. Willie always writes songs with lyrics that most people can relate to. These songs are perfect examples of that. Countryman is an album that further establishes Willie Nelson as a musical legend. I loved it.

I really enjoyed reading this biography of Albert Einstein, because I learned a little bit about physics. I learned the formula for calculating accleration. The formula for calculating velocity is times mass. I also learned that people in different states of motion measure events and objects differently. Issacson also discusses Einstein's theory about light, for which he won the Nobel prize for science in 1922. Walter Issacson makes physics sounds very interesting, and I believe he truly teaches the reader some basic principles of physics in this book.This biography is indeed educational, but it is also entertaining. Issacson portrays Albert Einstein as a compassionate man. Einstein used his talent for playing the violin. He performed in concerts to raise money to send to Jewish people living in Germany. Einstein was a world traveller. He visited Japan to talk about his scientific theory of relativity, and he also visited Jerusalem, and he helped establish a Hebrew University there. He even had the opportunity to become the leader of Israel in his later years.He was a genius as a scientist, but he was often emotionally distant towards his two sons and his wife. One of the more interesting opinions in this book is Einstein's view on science. He felt that the goal of scientists was to make the lives of ordinary citizens better by helping them understand the world around them. Einstein was a man who was against war and violence. Yet, his famous equation about energy and mass spurred the development of the atom bomb during World War II that was dropped on Hiroshima. This is a very long book. It can be hard to read for some because of the heavy scientific material in it. I think anyone can enjoy this book, whether they have a knowledge of physics or not.

The King of Queens is the funniest show on TV. Kevin James and Leah Remini and Kevin James as Doug and Carrie Heffernen have such great chemistry as a married couple. I loved Jerry Stiller's character Arthur who plays Carrie's father, because he is so paranoid but lovable. The First Season of The King of Queens is a 3 disc package that includes the entire first season of 25 episodes with 2 bonus episodes. This DVD also has fun extra features like a collection of short funny clips from the show. I also loved listening to the comments of the actors and the creator of the show about the success of the show and the characters they play.One of my favorite episodes from the first season is entitled Best Man where Doug and Carrie attend the wedding of one of Carrie's old boyfriends and embarass themselves completely. I also loved the episode where Carrie's father Arthur has a romantic fling with Doug's aunt which drives Doug crazy. I really enjoyed the episode where Carrie goes shopping for Thanksgiving dinner, but she has no idea what to buy. I love watching The King of Queens very much. I hope the other 5 seasons of the show are released on DVD eventually.

This book is a wonderful collection of stories from every year of the 20th century. The authors of the letters are famous people and ordinary citizens. These letters express every human emotion love, loss, triumph, joy, and hope. This book is a pleasure to read.My favorite story is about a young woman writing to her best friend about her bad marriage. Her husband is physically abusive to her and her son. She yearns for the courage to escape and become an independant woman which she eventually does. Another story by a young man who actually survived the sinking of the Titanic He writes his girlfriend about his experience of getting off the ship and waiting to be rescued.There is a letter by a woman in Hawaii to her brother in Ohio. She recounted witnessing the bombing of Pearl Harbor during World War 2. She recounts going to a bomb shelter and depicts the commaraderie among the people of the time.There is a Dear John letter addressed to Ernest Hemmingway from a nurse who cared for him while he was wounded in World War 1 He loved her but their relationship was a mere fling to her. She lets him down gently. This relationship inspired Hemingway to write the novel The Sun Also Rises. There is another letter written by a young unwed pregnant woman in the 1930's seeking advice from a doctor. Her father has no knowledge of the pregnancy and her mother is dead. She has nobody to turn to and her desperate plea for guidance is very touching.There is another poignant letter written by the sister of a Vietnam Vet who died from lymphnoma as a result of exposure to Agent Orange. She expresses her disbelief, loss and sorrow to an anti war group. There are several stories written by expectant parents to their unborn children. Each letter is filled with anticipation and hope. Buy this book. You will never be able to put it down.

The Dana Owens album proves that Queen Latifah can really sing. I loved listening to this album very much. My favorite track is Mercy Mercy Mercy. She sounds so good singing this song. I think her voice has so much power and energy. I think she really sings from the heart here. I loved the horns in the background on this track too. Baby Get Lost is a sassy track with attitude, and I loved it Queen Latifah really gives her listeners a taste of what R and B music sounded like it in the 40's.Another highlight track for me is the song California Dreaming. This performance is so soulful and excellent. It is a great song. I think Queen Latifah's cover of this song is the best one I've ever heard. Queen Latifah sounds so sexy and smooth on Nina Simone's classic blues song I Put A Spell on You. She really makes this song her own. The legendary Herbie Hancock does an awesome job playing the piano on this track. I loved this song. I never heard of the song Close Your Eyes before, but I loved the way Queen Latifah sings this I just felt so relaxed listening to this track. Her vocal performance on this song is so good.I like her rendition of the Bill Withers song Same Love. It is a classic R and B song from the 70's I think Queen Latifah does a great job singing this song. The Dana Owens album is a pleasant surprise.

The songs on the Shark Tale soundtrack are very good. If you like rap or hip hop music, you will love this CD. My favorite track is the hit song Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliot. I love it when these two talented performers sing together.I enjoyed the song Gold Digger by Ludacris. I've never heard him rap before, but I really like this song a lot. Three Little Birds is a very cute song with Sean Paul and Ziggy Marley. It has a nice regaae sound to it. Mary J Blige lends her talents on the song Got to Be Real. I love the way she sings this classic song. It is a fun song that will get you moving.I'm not a big fan of Justin Timberlake, but he sounds pretty good on the song Good Foot with Timbaland. This track has a great beat, and I enjoyed it. I love the song India Arie performs on here entitled Get It Together. Her voice is so smooth and soulful on this song. This is definitely one of the better tracks on the soundtrack Composer Hans Zimmer contributes an excellent instrumental track entitled Some of My Best Friends are Sharks. This track sounds just beautiful.This is an excellent soundtrack to a very cute movie.

Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. He has combined elements of king fu movies, old Japanese samurai shows, and cowboy westerns to create a great action movie. Uma Thurman is so great as a former assassin who turns into an angry bride focused on revenge on everyone after her wedding and life are ruined. This movie is non stop action from beginning to end. I loved the scene where Uma takes on a roomful of assassins with black masks and swords and kills them all. Every fight scene is fun to watch. I loved the fight scene between Uma Thurman and Vivica A Fox. It was so funny how they stopped fighting and acted like everything was okay when the little girl came through the door. Lucy Liu gives a wonderful performance as an tough Asian assassin. I loved the scene in the movie where she slices off a person's head after he insults her. The Japanese animation sequence looks so good in this movie. I loved watching the making of the movie where Quentin Tarantino talks about his sources of inspiration for making Kill Bill. There is a pretty good performance by a female Japanese rock band called 5, 6, 7, 8 that is included on this DVD that I enjoyed. Kill Bill is the best action movie I've seen in a long time.

Teacher Man is a very funny and touching memoir of Frank McCourt's career as an English teacher at different places in New York. One of the most funniest parts in the book happened on Frank McCourt's first day as a teacher at a vocational school in Staten Island. To settle a fight between two students, Frank McCourt ate a bologna sandwich that was thrown on the floor by one of the students. There is a very touching moment in the book where a student named Phyllis wrote an essay about the day her father died, and how it happened on the day America put a man on the moon in 1969.Mccourt spent most of his career teaching creative writing at a prestigious college prep high school called Stuyvesant. I really admire McCourt creative teaching methods. To encourage his students to appreciate writing in all forms, he had them read recipes from cookbooks while other students played music in the background. To help them be better writers, he had his students write critiques about the food in the school cafeteria and restaurants in New York. McCourt also had his students write about what they ate for dinner and how they felt about the people around them.McCourt also shares experiences about his life outside of the classroom in Teacher Man. I enjoyed writing reading how he failed to earn a PHD in English at Trinity College in Ireland. I also liked reading about how he went to counseling to try to save his marriage. McCourt's failures in these endeavors are very honest, and it made me realize that even the best teacher can make mistakes in life. Teacher Man is a very entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt memoir about a man who dedicated his life to teaching, and I loved it.

I love this new album from Elton John. He plays the piano so effortlesslly. I think his voice radiates understanding and compassion too. The first single is entitled The Bridge is proof of his level of compassion. It is a beautiful but sad song about suicide. This song is about how the pressures of life can be too great for some people to deal with. Elton's vocals are very moving here. The title track is a reminder to always look ahead in life and never look back. And The House Fell Down is another moving song. This tune is about how difficult it is to break an addiction to drugs and other negative forces that can bring a person down. Postcards From Richard Nixon is an interesting song title. This song is about the stress of being the President United States. I really like this song. Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way is a song about all the things Elton loves about New York City like the snow in the winter time and taxi cabs. I Must Have Lost It OnThe Wind is a song about the lessons we learn from the relationships we have. He sounds great on the upbeat track Just Like Noah's Ark. Blues Never Fade Away is a tribute to late entertainers like Liberace and Janis Joplin. This song is about how their influence is still felt today. Old '67 is a nice song about two friends remembering old times together. This is a fantastic new CD from music legend Elton John.

3121 is Prince's best effort in years. He sounds great vocally. I think all the musicians playing on this album sound very good too. My favorite track is Beautiful Loved and Blessed. This is a song about how the person you are in love with makes you feel. Tamar Braxton shines singing with Prince on this track. I think she has such a pretty voice. I also loved the tracks Te Amo Corazon and The Dance. These are very romantic songs with a very sensual feel to them. Black Sweat and Get On The Boat are two songs that will get you moving. Black Sweat doesn't make me sweat, but I really liked the funky beat to it. I think Fury is another standout track on this album too. Prince plays the electric guitar with such energy on this song. 3121 is a very entertaining album. I enjoyed it very much.

It's Time is a pleasure to listen to. Michael Buble is a very talented singer. He sounds like the Frank Sinatra of the 21st century. He even covers the classic Sinatra song I've Got you Under My Skin superbly. He also covers the Beatles hit Can't Buy Me Love here, and he gives it a pleasant lively spin. My favorite track is Home though. It is an excellent song about being away from someone you love and longing to be with that person. Another highlight track on this CD is the duet with Nelly Furtado Quando Quando Quando. It is a very romantic song about two people in love. I also enjoyed the song Feeling Good. It is an optimistic song of renewal. This track has a nice jazz sound to it, that I really liked it. Try A Little Tenderness is a pretty song. It is a reminder to show a little compassion and tenderness to someone who needs it. Buble's voice is so soothing especially on a song like You Don't Know Me. This song is so relaxing. I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good music.

This is the best R and B CD of 2006 so far. India Arie sounds so sensual and soulful. The lyrics of these songs are so deep and meaningful. The loving intro is a very deep track about accepting the things a person can't change in life and working on the things they can. The great grandma track shows how much of an influence India's grandma has had in her life. There's Hope is a very optimistic happy song about how important a person's attitude is in life. Another highlight is I Am Not My Hair. India sings about how a certain hairstyle should not define who a person is. I really like when she starts sings about the different hairstyles she has had in her life. These Eyes is such a smooth track. This is a song about two people breaking up with each other, because one partner did not give the other the respect they deserve. The Heart of The Matter is a cover of a Dan Henley song. I love the way India sings it so smoothly. This is a great song about having forgiveness not only toward other people but also ourselves. I Choose is a standout track about taking charge of your own life and making your own decisions. Summer is just a fun track about how it feels to be with someone special to you in the summer time. Private Party is an excellent song about the importance of loving yourself first. I really enjoyed listening to this CD. The songs are so personal.

There are some short poems in this book that are very enjoyable. The poems by Edna St Vincent Millay and Emily Dickinson are great examples. I was drawn to Hope Is The Thing with Feathers I loved the interesting title, but I also appreciated the wonderful metaphor in the poem about what hope is. I loved Portrait By a Neighbor by Edna St Vincent Millay. Her poems exemplify that mere observations and perceptions can be very poetic.I loved the poem Ithaca because it is such a motivational poem. It has wonderful vivid images. This kind of poem can motivate people to go out and seek their own adventure Another motivational poem is Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening. The last stanza of the poem was quoted by President Kennedy in his speeches. It is a great poem about determination and staying true to your goals.Loss can be very poetic. This is evident in another one of my favorite poems in this book Annabelle Lee. It is a lovely lyrical poem about losing the love of one's life. It is about loving a person so much in life that you can't bear to live without them after they are gone.The section in the book written by Jacqueline O herself is noteworthy. The essay about The Books I Read When I was young is very inspring. Jackie O's poem about her husband Meanwhile in Massachusetts is very reflective and prophetic.This is one of the best books I have read all year.

It is impossible to select a favorite poem in this book, because they are all so beautiful and unique. I loved the diversity of themes in this book. There are poems about America, Adventure, Escape, Reflection, Romance and Love. These were subjects that were important to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Caroline Kennedy writes such eloquent introductions to each theme. Each introduction gives us a glimpse into what a beautiful person Jackie Kennedy was.There are several passages from the Bible that are just wonderful. I loved the passage from Ecclesiastes, because it so deep and philosophical in the way it describes the cycle of things in life. The passage from Matthew is very good because it talks about the virtues we should all try to cultivate like being merciful and being pure of heart. The 23rd psalm is a wonderful poem. It teaches us to accept and not to be afraid of death.I loved the poems by Robert Frost and Langston Hughes selected in this book. Let America Be America Again addresses the subject of inequality. This poem is so optimistic and patriotic as Hughes identifies himself with every race in America. One of my favorite poems by Robert Frost is presented here. I really enjoyed the Road Not Taken because it has a very clear message. Each of us has to make a decision about what path we want to take in life and that decision is not always easy.Some of the love poems in the book are hard to understand especially the sonnets and the poems I loved the line Shall I compare thee to a summer's day. Even though I didn't understand the whole poem, the first two lines are beautiful. I loved She Walks in Beauty by Lord Byron because of the poet's descriptive words and memorable phrases like the first line she walks in beauty like the night I really like the last 2 lines of this poem. I seek someone whose mind is at peace and whose heart whose love is innocent as the poem suggests. This is such a enjoyable book. It has inspired me to continue writing poetry of my own.

Il Divo stands for divine male performer. It is an appropriate name for these four talented pop opera singers. Spainard Carlos Marin has a rich deep baritone voice. American David Miller has such a soothing tenor voice. Their voices blend so well with Switzerland's Urs Buhler and France's Sebastian Izambard. I love the classic American Christmas standards like Silent Night, White Christmas and O Holy Night. Ave Maria is a very moving classic French song. The Lord's Prayer is an unusual track. To hear these famillar words performed in song is a treat. Adeste Fidelis has a similar soothing spiritual quality. Panis Angelicus is a track that shows off the powerful resonant voices of these young men. Every note of this song sounds perfect. The piano playing is lovely on the track A Child is Born. It accompanies the vocals well. Over the Rainbow is not a Christmas song. Nonetheless, it is a classic song with a hopeful peaceful quality to it. This CD is filled with beautiful music.

I bought Rock Swings, because I wanted to see how a legend like Paul Anka would sing these rock and pop and songs from the 80s and 90s. I loved the song selection on this album.My favorite track is his cover of the Eric Clapton's song Tears in Heaven. I think he sings this song about pain and loss beautifully. Another highlight track on this CD is BlackHole Sun. The piano playing by Mike Lang on this track are so good. The bass guitar playing on the track Hello is so smooth and subtle. It gives the song a very romantic tone. His vocals on the song Everybody Hurts is very soothing. I really liked it. Smells like Teen Spirit is another one of my favorites on this CD. I can finally understand the words to this song now. The trumpet playing by Charlie Davis and trombone playing by Steve Higgins are very good on this track. They give this song a very upbeat sound that I really liked. Anka's cover of Van's Halen's Jump sounds pretty good. I liked the saxophone and drum playing on this track. Another standout on this album is Anka's cover of the song Wonderwall. All of the instruments are featured on this track, and they sound groovy. Rock Swings is truly a pleasure to listen to.

Reba collaborates with the biggest names in music on this album. The result is a very entertaining disc. Nobody sings about heartache and the difficulty of relationships better than Reba. She performs duets with Vince Gill, Kenny Chesney Don Henley, and Leeann Rimes. These songs are about the pain of failed relationships. I love the way Reba harmonizes with the talented performers on these tracks. I love the musical arrangement of the track "Does The Wind Still Blow In Oklahoma". This song is about two people feeling lonely and home sick. I love the violins playing on this track and Ronnie's Dunn's vocals. "Everyday People" is a track that stands out. This is an excellent tune about people helping those in crisis. "Sleeping With The Telephone" is a song for all the military wives who miss their husbands serving in a hostile country like Iraq. This is a very touching tune. This CD is very enjoyable to listen to.

Most of the songs on this CD are about falling in and out of love, and that is okay with me. I just hope Taylor will include more of his personal experiences in his music in the future though. Having said that, I think this is a very good debut. The drum beat and the trumpet playing sound really good on this first track The Runaround. It is a very fun track to start off the CD. Soul Thing is another fun uplifting track here. The Right Place is another highlight here. This track shows Taylor's romantic soulful side. The piano playing on this track is beautiful. Dream Myself Awake is another nice track. The electric guitar playing gives this song a nice pop rock edge. Give Me Tonight is a groovy sounding track. This is a good song to play at parties and dance to. Places I've Been is a very touching song about how a special individual can change another person's life. This is a very enjoyable debut CD by Taylor Hicks.

This is an excellent greatest hits collection by John Cougar Mellencamp. Listening to this CD brought back a lot of memories. He writes songs that everyone can relate to. I think that is why he has been around for so long.His new single Thank You is a great song of appreciation. It is a tribute to all the honest working people in America. Jack and Diane is an excellent song about the remembering to savor your youth. I also enjoyed the song Small Town in which John Mellencamp sings about why he loves living in a small town. I also enjoyed his more recent songs especially his duet Wild Night with Michelle Ochello. It is a very good song originally performed by Van Morrison. John's cover of this song has such a great beat. I also enjoyed the song I Saw You First. This is a very catchy tune. I like to think of this track as a love song berween two people, but this song is also about the perception that latinos have about American music and vice versa. This greatest hits collection comes with a bonus DVD which has videos of some of his biggest hits. My favorite video on this bonus CD is Rain on the Scarecrow. This is a great video and song about how much respect John has for the hard work that farmers do growing food.I enjoyed listening to all these songs on this greatest hits collection by John Cougar Mellencamp. If you enjoyed listening to pop and rock in the late 70s and 80s, this CD is for you.

I bought History in 1995, and I still love it. Disc one contains classic cuts from Michael's three most successful solo albums. My favorite cuts are "Rock With You", "Thirller", "Billie Jean", "Remember the Time" and "Beat It". Disc two contains more personal songs. I love his duet "Scream" with his sister Janet. "Childhood" is a deeply personal song about Michael's lost childhood. This song is beautiful. "They Don't Really Care About Us" has such a great beat. I love the electric guitar playing on this track. "Smile" and "You Are Not Alone" are such peaceful songs. They really relaxe me. Mike sounds great covering the Beatles classic "Come Together". I love the music contained on these two discs very much.

I love this soundtrack. Every track on this disc is good. Glen Hansard is a talented guitar player and vocalist. Marketa Irglova is also a very talented vocalist and keyboard player. The upbeat track "Trying To Pull Myself Away" is the best of the bunch. Hansard's vocals are so good on this track. His guitar playing sounds different on each track. "Fallen From The Sky" is a track with a good beat. This song is very pleasant to listen to. The other standout track is "Falling Slowly" This is a very romantic song, and I think the two stars harmonize nicely on this track. "Lies" is another pretty duet on this soundtrack. The violin playing is subtle and beautifully performed on this track. "Gold" is a very optimistic track. Hansard's guitar playing is very upbeat on this track. "Broken Hearted Hoover" is a very funny song. Marketa Irglova has such a clear and sexy voice. She sings lead vocal on the tracks on If You Want Me" and "The Hill" The piano playing on the latter track is pretty. Her voice sounds so sad and sensual on these two tracks. I really like them. "Once" is a goregous sounding song about how feelings between two people change over time in a relationship. Once is the best soundtrack of the year so far.

I grew up listening to the music of The Eagles. This 2 disc set contains all of their greatest hits. This brought back a lot of good musical memories for me. I love Don Henley's lead vocals on songs like Hotel California, Desperado, and Lyin' Eyes. I love Tim Schmit's lead vocals on songs like I Can't Tell You Why. Tim also sings the lead on the very pretty song Love Will Keep Us Alive. This song was featured on their Hell Freezes Over album from the early 1990's. I also liked the song Hole In The World This song was written in response to the tragedy on 9/11. It is one of newest classics. All four band members harmonize beautifully on this song. What I love about the Eagles is that their sound is so versatile. The song The Best of My Love was a hit on both the pop and country music charts in the 70's. Life In the Fast Lane is a great rock song. It is another one of my many favorites on this excellent 2 disc set.

I really enjoyed reading Big Russ and Me a few years ago, so I was eager to read this book when I received it. Tim Russert writes very personal interesting introductions at the beginning of each chapter in this book. Most of these introductions are about the relationship he has with either his hard working elderly dad or his son who is in college. I loved the submission The Card by Pat Frantz Cercone. It is a great example about how a father would do anything for his daughter. Her father taught her how to cook. He even sewed a dress for her when she needed one. The author of this touching submission was raised by her father when her mother died when she was a little girl. I loved the submission entitled Mr. Strawberry by Joseph Harrison Kelly. This is a wonderful story about how a simple generous act of giving $20 to a person in need can have a long lasting impact. I loved the submission The Plumber by Cathy Slosar, because this is a good example of showing how every occupation is worthy of respect. I loved the submission the Milkman by Patricia Farrell. It is a good story that shows how a job can teach a child how to be responsible. The Mail is a beautiful submission about how a mailman touches everyone on his route. I loved the submission by Craig James entitled The Lunch Box by Craig James and The Ticket by Edwin Romond. These are very touching submissions about how simple objects can have so much sentimental value to a person. I loved the submission Hermie's Hands by Jon Hermanson. It is a great story about how a father remained a productive and useful person despite having just eight fingers. The Sculptor is a good submission that reminds us that having a disability should not prevent anyone from having a full productive life. I enjoyed the submission The Groceries. This is a beautiful submission about how a man who made some bad decisions earlier in his life reconnected with his father. Wisdom of Our Fathers is filled with moving stories about fathers, and I loved it.

This CD contains songs from all different music genres, and I think the contestants perform their songs well. Most of these people will have very successful music careers. Think by Katharine McPhee is my favorite track. I think she has a beautiful voice. Taylor's version of Taking It To the Streets is so upbeat and energetic. Mandisa sings an awesome version of I'm Every Woman. There is an uplifting quality in her voice that I like. I also like Elliott's version of Moody's in the Mood for love. I think he has a very relaxing voice. Chris Daughtry's performance of Dead or Alive is very good too. I love the rock edge quality in his voice. Ace has a very sexy voice. He gives a good rendition of Father Figure. Kellie Pickler gives a very unique rendition of Walking After Midnight. Her voice is very appealing. Melissa belts out a very sensual rendition of What About Love. I have always liked this song. Paris' version of Midnight Train to Georgia is soulful and enjoyable. Kevin gives a decent performance of When I Fall in Love. Even though he isn't the best singer, there is a romantic quality in Kevin's voice. I really enjoyed listening to this CD.

This soundtrack has some very good music. Elvis Costello sings a playful and mischievous rendition of Let's Misbehave. Natalie Cole sounds great on her version of Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye. She sounds very sexy and subtle. I really liked it. Alanis Morrisette lends her talents on the track Lets Fall In Love. I love her energy and the vocal range she displays on this track. Diana Krall is a great piano player and she sounds so smooth and jazzy on this song Just One of Those Things.I never knew that Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd could sing so well. Their duet In the Still of the Night is just beautiful. Their voices are This is a very romantic song. I enjoyed Ashley Judd duet with Tayler Hamilton True Love. She can really carry a tune, and she sounds so sweet. Kevin Kline gives several performances on this soundtrack. I loved the way he sings Be A Clown. His duet Blow Gabriel Blow sounds like a song I would sing with one of my buddies in a bar. I enjoyed Kevin Kline delivery on both of these songs. The classic song You're the Top by Cole Porter is excellent. This is one of my favorite songs of all time, but I did not know who sang it until I bought this CD. I loved the music on this soundtrack so much!

This is a very entertaining cast recording. I have never seen the show live, so this cast recording is the next best thing. The late Fred Ebb did a great job writing this funny entertaing songs. John Kander did an equally superb job composing the music for them. Curtains is a musical within a musical plus a murder mystery. Every cast member shines on this. Debra Monk is one of the stars. I think she steals the show on tracks like "Thataway" and "It's A Business. These songs are so funny. Debra Monk has a wonderful sense of humor, and it shows on these tracks. David Hyde Pierce is the detective investigating the murder. He has a pleasant delivery on the track "Coffee Shop Nights" David Hyde is so charming on the duet "Tough Act To Follow" with his love interest in the musical Jill Paice. Jason Danieley really stands out on the track "I Miss The Music" This track is one of my favorites, because of his strong resonant singing voice. "In The Same Boat" is such a cute sounding number too. I enjoyed this cast recording so much.

Donny Osmond does a good job performing these classic songs from the 1970's. My favorite track is "Mandy". The piano playing by musician Raymond Angry is very pretty. He accompanies Donny's vocals well on the song. I also like Donny's cover of "Will It Go Around In Circles", "Let's Stay Together", and "I Can See Clearly Now" I think his voice sounds very soulful on these tracks. Neil Jason provides a groovy bass on this songs. I love the energy in his voice. "Laughter In The Rain" is a pleasant sounding track too. I really enjoyed the up tempo song of the track "How Long". "If" and "Alone Again Naturally" are beautiful love songs. There is a hint of sadness on this tracks, and I think Donny conveys this feeling well. "How Deep Is Your Love" and "You Are So Beautiful" were my least favorites on this CD. Donny does a good job singing this songs, but I just did not enjoy them as much as the others. However, I enjoyed most of the music on this CD, and I would recommend it to anyone.

No Excuses is an inspiring autobiography about the life of Kyle Maynard. His discipline and dedication to wrestling and exercise began when he was only eleven years old. There is a section at the end of this book that describes how he exercises and what he eats to stay fit. He stays in shape by doing everything from running or sprinting like a bear, doing pushups and lifting weights daily. Kyle Maynard credits his success in sports and life to God and his loving parents who taught him that all things are possible through effort and persistence. He also credits his wrestling coach for teaching him the sport. Kyle Maynard is very a humble person despite all of his success.Maynard describes the sport of wrestling as a sport that requires physical and mental toughness. He explains the rules and moves of wrestling so well. He makes wrestling sound so exciting. I could actually visualize him taking his opponent down on the wrestling mat trying to pin him. There are great photos in this book of Kyle wrestling and lifting extremely heavy weights. I am simply amazed that a physically disabled person like Kyle can do all these things. I am not surprised that someone with Kyle's postive attitude is now a successful motivational speaker and athlete. No Excuses is one of the best autobiographies I've ever read.

This is a very insightful book with lots of information. It is well written and researched. There are many differences between the way Westerners and Easterners think. Some of the points may seem obvious, but they are still interesting to read about. Children who grow up in the East learn verbs faster. In contrast, children in the West pick up nouns faster. This is because Easterners learn the relationships between objects with action words first. Westerners generally just learn what the object is first. Conflict resolution is handled very differently too. The goal in Eastern conflict resolution is to reduce hostility and to reach a compromise. The goal in resolving conflict in the West is having satisfaction that justice was carried out with a clear winner and loser. However as the author suggests Westerners have to begun to embrace a lot of Eastern ideas. There is a greater emphasis in achieving harmony in a person's life in Eastern cultures. Asian people are more self critical of themselves as a result. In contrast, the goal of a Westerner is to achieve a sense of uniqueness and superiority. I also learned that students who study history in the West focus on the implications or outcomes of events first. Asian students study the causes of historical events first. Teacher training and evaluation is a process that never ends in Eastern countries unlike the West where it is short.The Geography of Thought is a very short book, but it should not be read rapidly because of the depth and quantity of information. I have a greater insight and appreciation for the way people think now. I enjoyed it very much.

This is a very good album of soul classics. After over 30 years together, Hall and Oates pay tribute to the music that inspired them to become musicians. The best track is their cover of the Spinners song I'll Be Around, but there are so many others. I loved their version of Ooh Child. It is a very postive and optimistic song. Used To Be My Girl is another favorite of mine on this album. I also liked the song Used To Be My Girl. This song has a great beat and really captures the spirit of the original.There is a beautiful rendition of You Are Everything on here. I think this is one of the best love songs ever written and Hall and Oates sing it so well. I liked the song Can't Get Enough of Your Love too. Hall and Oates' version of this song sounds just as soulful, but I think is more subtle and mellow than Barry White's original.Neither One of Us is another highlight for me on this CD. Darryl Hall's voice has so passion singing this Gladys Knight classic. You can sense the pain of losing someone in his voice. I really liked it.Our Kind Of Soul is a CD filled with great tunes. All of the tracks sound great and bring back a lot of memories for me. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys classic soul.

Celine Dion is back making beautiful music. This is a very good CD. The inspiration for Miracle is the birth of her son three years ago. Celine's rendition of Roberta Flack's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face is my favorite track on this album. This is one of the best songs ever written. I think Celine performs this song so well. I loved Celine's cover of the John Lennon's classic Beautiful Boy. It is a wonderful song about the joy of watching your child grow up.I also enjoyed Brahms Lullaby. It is interesting to hear a classic instrumental composition performed with lyrics and Celine does an excellent job on it. A Mother's Prayer is a beautiful song that Celine performed as a duet with Andrea Bocelli at the Grammys a few years ago. She sings this song as a solo here and it is just as moving.Celine shows that her voice sounds beautiful in any language. She performs a French love song here that I really liked. In Some Small Way is a song that shows that Celine has not lost amazing vocal range. This is a lovely ballad in the mold of her earlier work in my opinion.If I Could is a very pretty song. I have heard this song performed by various artists like Oleta Adams. If I Could is a song about all the things we would do to protect our child. I think the lyrics in this songs are very meaningful and heartfelt. Celine sings this song superbly and with great feeling.I enjoyed listening to all the songs on this CD. The music on this CD is very relaxing and romantic. Miracle is a must have for all Celine Dion fans.

This CD is an excellent retrospective of Jackson Browne's career. Jackson Browne has always been one of my favorite singers and songwriters. There is so much sincerity and passion in his voice. This CD features most of his hits. I would liked to have seen his lively duet with Clarence Cleamons Your Friend of Mine on here and also the song Call It A Loan, but I was pleased with what I heard.I love Jackson Browne's song The Pretender. The lyrics about struggling to make a living while trying to find someone to love you are as moving today as they were 30 years ago when the song came out. Doctor My Eyes and Running on Empty are just classic songs that I will never get tired of listening to. I love the romantic quality of the song Tender is the Night and Somebodys Baby. I was glad to hear Lawyers In Love on here. It is a great song about the restless political climate in the US in the early 80's.Jackson Browne has never been afraid to address social issues in his music like in the song In the Shape of A Heart which is about domestic abuse. In America is a very thoughtful song that reminds us for that the price for our freedom comes at someone's else expense. The Very Best Of Jackson Browne is an absolute pleasure to listen to.

I really enjoyed listening to this CD. My favorite track is Carrie Underwood's cover of the Martina McBride song Independence Day. It is a great country tune about what a woman does to get out of an abusive relationship. Bo Bice is another one of my favorite contestants. I love his energy on the track I Don't Want To Be. It is an awesome rock song about trying to stay true to yourself. I also liked Constantine's version of My Funny Valentine. He has a sexy voice and sings this song well. Lindsay Cardinale's performance of Knock On Wood is very spirited and fun. I liked this song very much. Another noteworthy track on this album is Jessica Sierra's performance of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of The Heart. She sings this song with a lot of emotion and feeling, and I loved it.Vonzell Solomon sings the disco classic Best of My Love with a lot of spirit. I really liked her rendition of this fun song.Every Time You Go Away is one of my favorite songs. Anthony does a good job singing it. His voice conveys the sense of loss pretty well. Anwar Robinson has a beautiful voice. His performance of A House Is Not A Home is very moving and soulful. Season 4 Showstoppers is a collection of outstanding vocal performances. I think that most of these contestants are capable of having successful careers in music. This is one of the best American Idol CDs in my opinion.

John Galloway worked as a waiter for 15 years in the restaurant business mostly spending his time working in expensive upscale restaurants in the Washington DC area. The personal experiences of the people he worked with, the patrons he served, and the trends he witnessed are included in this autobiography.Galloway is brutally honest about the amount of stealing of anything from cups to art work that occurs by employees in expensive restaurants. He is also very candid about the prevalence of alcohol and other drug abuse involving people who work in restaurants. The diversity of his customers at his restaurant included Japanese businessmen, war veterans, and even gangsters.I was surprised by the amount of training being a waiter involved. Galloway was also tested by his managers about the history of cigars and wine. I was amazed that he even had to read King Lear by Shakespeare for the his job. I learned the importance of tipping a hard fifth or 20% on any meal. I also learned that women should always order first in a restaurant. Furthermore, I learned that I should never call to make a dinner reservation at the busy crunch time. I was shocked by some of his personal experiences in this book. One particular incident stood out for me in which Galloway once served a large party of French African royalty. The amount of their bill was $4000, and he received only $40 as a tip. Galloway also served famous people like President George Bush and singer Roy Orbison.This book is filled with facts about US history and trivia. I learned the President McKinley appears on the $500 bill and President Cleveland appears on the $1000 bill. I also learned that abolitionist Frederick Douglass was the black man to receive a vote for presidency in 1888. I also learned that the Gull is Utah's state bird. I learned about the Trail of Tears in which thousands of Cherokee Indians were driven from their land by US troops in 1838 and 1839. In a sense, reading this book was like having a mini history lesson. Fine Dining Madness is an informative, entertaining book about every facet of fine dining. I really enjoyed it.

Burn After Reading is a good dark comedy from the Coen brothers. This movie has an all star cast. This movie is a commentary about what happens to people when they reach middle age. Frances McDormand steals the movie as a woman looking for love. She has a strong desire for cosmetic surgery that a lot of middle age women do. Brad Pitt is also funny as an employee of a health club. John Malkovich's character is going through a crisis after losing his job. He has some funny moments in the movie with just his physical presence. I really like the musical score that Carter Burwell did for this movie. The earth theme in the beginning of the movie is very upbeat. I liked watching the bonus features with the crew talking about making the movie.

This is an excellent soundtrack. I loved the Kelly Clarkson's song Breakaway. It is a great song about becoming independent and making your own choices in life. Kelly Clarkson has a great voice and sounds great on this song The video for Breakaway is included on this soundtrack. It is very fun to watch. Lindsay Lohan has a very good voice. She performs an excellent song entitled I Decide on this soundtrack. This song is also about making your own decisions in life.I loved the song This is My Time by Raven. The message of this song is that your dreams cone true if you believe in yourself and that nothing is impossible. Raven is a talented singer with a nice vocal range. This song is definitely a highlight on this soundtrack for me. I loved the track Trouble By Pink. This is an very energetic song that just makes me want to dance. Pink is an awesome performer and sings this song well. Norah Jones lends her talents singing the song Love Me Tender. This song is very relaxing and soothing. I really enjoyed it.The song Miracles Happen by Jonny Blu is very interesting. Part of this song is performed in English and part of this song is performed in Chinese. It is always interesting to me to hear a foreign language on a pop song. I really enjoyed this track. I think this song sounds really neat.The duet Your Crowning Glory with Julie Andrews and Raven is very cute and playful. I liked listening to this song very much. The Princess Diaries 2 soundtrack has some great music. I really enjoyed it.

Songs from the West Coast is Elton John's best effort since the Lion King. This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore is a great song about the fleeting nature of fame and popularity. I love the rousing song the Emperor's New Clothes. It is a lively type of song. I would put a few bucks in a jar if I heard it played in a bar or club. Look Ma, No Hands is a wonderful song about finding a sense of happiness and contentment in life. I love the sassy seductive tune The Wasteland. It is one of those songs you can tap your feet to. I enjoyed the song Dark Diamond, because it has a soul and gospel feel to it. Stevie Wonder sounds great on the harmonica on this track. I Want Love is about a person yearning for love while knowing that relationships are often not very smooth. I enjoyed the romantic ballads Original Sin and Mansfield. This is one CD I will never get tired of listening to.

The Descendants is a beautiful film shot in Hawaii. This film showcases the beauty of Hawaii well. I love the shots of the valleys and beaches. I live here so this is something I see every day. George Clooney stars as Matt King. He is a father trying to raise his daughters after his wife goes into a coma after a boating accident.Matt learns from his teenage daughter that his wife was carrying on an affair at the time of her accident. The daughter is played Shailene Woodley. Upon learning about his wife's infidelity, Matt chooses to locate and confront the man having an affair with his wife. An actor named Matthew Lillard plays Brian Speer. He is the man having an affair with Matt King's wife. An actress named Judy Greer plays Speer's wife. These characters each have individual scenes with Clooney that are both dramatic and comedic.I have an empathy for any father facing the issues of dating and alcoholism with his daughter. Their relationship is authentic. The chemistry between Clooney and Woodley is the most appealing aspects of this movie. I have an empathy for any father and daughter facing these typical teenage issues.The music is note worthy here. The soundtrack is filled with Hawaiian music that is playing in the background. I don't understand a word of the Hawaiian language, but the slack key music is so peaceful and soothing. The music reflects what living in Hawaii is like. It is laid back and peaceful. The Descendants is an excellent film.

John Mayer is a talented musician and songwriter. I love this new disc. My favorite track is Vultures. This is a song about survival This song is also about trying to handle the pressures in life. Slow Dancing in a Burning Room is an interesting song title. It is a song about the tension between a man and a woman. Gravity is another track that showcases Mayer's talent as guitar player. His guitar playing on this track is very touching and bluesy. Waiting For The World To Change is another highlight here. This is a song about hope that things will change. Dreaming with a Broken Heart and In Repair are two beautiful songs about a person who is emotionally damaged from a relationship. The piano playing by Ricky Peterson is so good on Dreaming With A Broken Heart. I'm Gonna Find Another You is a song about a person moving on after a bad relationship. The Heart of Life is a pretty song about people need support from each other to survive in life. Belief and Stop This Train are two excellent song about respecting the different beliefs that other people have and keeping an open mind about everthing. Steven Jordan provides a great beat throughout this CD on the drums. I love this new album by John Mayer very much.

The Help is the best film I have seen this year. This film is about the examples of accepted racism in the early sixties, but it is also about the friendship between women. I like the way director Tate Taylor deals with both subjects equally well.There is a very beautiful song included in the movie. It is entitled "The Living Proof". It is performed by R and B singer Mary J. Blige. This is such a moving song about enduring hard times but still having a sense of dignity about life. The soundtrack also includes classic songs by Chubby Checker and Frankie Valli, but the new Blige song is definitely the highlight in regards to the music.The performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are excellent. They are two black maids who both work for white families. They cook, clean and raise other people's children. These maids do their jobs do their jobs with such dignity. I admire these fictional characters. They seem like real people to me. These actresses bring the characters of a novel to life on screen. Emma Stone plays an aspiring writer who documents the experiences of these two women in a book entitled The Help. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a racist white woman. Jessica Chastain plays another white female character with a much softer heart. Sissy Spacek gives the movie a humorous element with her performance. I laughed and cried watching The Help. The Help is an excellent film.

Tower Heist is a funny movie. Ben Stiller plays a building manager named Josh Kovacs. He enlists the services of a thief named Slide. He is played by Eddie Murphy. Kovacs needs help to retrieve 20 million dollars in pension money. This is money that collectively t belongs to every employee of the building. This movie is stolen by a character played by Alan Alda. I like the way Stiller's characters gets everyone involved in the heist. The cast includes Casey Affleck, Michael Pena, Matthew Broderick and Gabourey Sidibe. All of their performances are good here. Each character posseses a trait that adds to the plot and humor of the movie.. My favorite part of the movie is when Eddie Murphy challenges everyone to steal something from a shopping mall to prove that they have what it takes to pull off a heist. Tower Heist features a Ferrari 250 GT Lusso that once belonged to actor Steve McQueen. This beautiful red car plays an important part in the film. This film is superbly scored by composer Christophe Beck. The Tower Heist theme is a groovy techno sound with a fantastic bass. His music adds tension at the appropriate times in the film. Tower Heist is an entertaining film with a superb cast.

This is an excellent teenage comedy. Director T. Sean Shannon captures teenage life from both genders. He understands the pressure they face from their peers so well. Spencer Breslin stars in the title role. He is the new kid in school who suffers from male pattern baldness. Harold is teased because of his baldness. Yet, he is a likeable person who manages to make allies. Nikki Blonsky does good supporting work as one of Harold's friends. Stella Maeve is superbly cast as Harold's older sister. Cuba Gooding Jr is perfectly cast as a janitor who befriends Harold. I love Harold's oversexed elderly neighbor Maude in the movie. She is so funny here. This is such an entertaining movie. I really enjoyed it.

Each track on this CD expresses a different emotion or feeling, and each number on this CD is a musical masterpiece. People who love jazz or any kind of music will enjoy this. Sweet and Lovely is the my favorite track. I think Monk's piano playing here conveys a wonderful feeling of romance. I think that Monk's mood and his slow piano playing on this track conveys such a lonely sexy feeling. I think the track Nutty has a delightful playful quality. Coltrane's saxophone playing is so elegant and smooth here, as it is throughout this CD. Evidence has a great curious probing feeling to it. I felt like I was searching for something when I listened to this piece. As I listened to the track entitled Epistrophy, I felt a sense of eager anticipation and joy. This is a very lively track. I felt very peaceful when I listened to Crepuscle. This is a very pretty track. All of the musicians compliment each other and play in harmony with together on this track. The bass playing by Ahmed Abdul Malik sounds so groovy and slick.I thought the track Epistrophy sounded so alive. Coltrane sounds so fearless playing his sax, I felt like that could conquer the world while listening to this track. This is beautiful music performed by jazz legends. I recommend it to anyone.

Neil Young is a music legend, and this concert DVD features Neil performing most of early hit songs at Massey Hall in Toronto Canada. He sounds great vocally. After watching this DVD, I am convinced that he is also a talented and under rated guitar player too. My favorite song is "Old Man." This song is about wanting to be loved and feeling alone. "Down By The River" is a hit that Neil had as a member of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. I love Neil's guitar playing on this song. The subject of the song is about how a man feels after he shoots the one he loves. The subject matter is weird to me, but Neil sounds great performing this tune. "Helpless" is another classic song. This tune is about how much Neil loves his home in Ontario Canada. "Heart Of Gold" is another excellent tune. I love Neil's harmonica playing here I also liked the song "The Needle and The Damage Done" This song is about the allure and danger of drugs, and the effects they can have on a person. "Ohio" is Neil's anti war song This song is his tribute to the four students who died at Kent State in 1970. This song is very moving and one of my favorites. I really enjoyed watching this DVD and listening to the music here. If you are a fan of Neil Young, this CD and DVD combo is a must for your collection.

I just picked up a copy of this CD and love it. If you are a Barry Manilow fan, you will enjoy this album like I did.The songs are on this album are from two of Barry Manilow's Broadway stage productions. Copacabana is a musical based on the Barry Manilow hit about a club. I loved the updated version of this song. It sounds fresh and upbeat. This song is definitely a major highlight on this album. Dancing Fool is a very energetic song that really makes you want to dance. Harmony is a musical about the first all boy band who broke up during World War 2. The title song to this awesome musical is included here. It is a light and pleasant song about trying to forget your troubles even though a war is going on. I also enjoyed the song Who Needs to Dream. This is a pretty romantic song that suits Barry's easy listening voice well.Barry duets with Olivia Newton John on a beautiful song called This Can't Be True. The two pop music icons from the 70's sound great together here. Barry sounds very good on this song Every Single Day. The lyrics are so powerful and dramatic. This song is very moving, and I absolutely loved it. Bolero De Amor is a song about a dance. I really enjoyed this song, and I thought Barry performed this number with a lot of love and passion.Stars in the Night is a song that reminds us to never give up hope even when things are tough. The message in this song fits the mood of the musical Harmony very well. I hope I get to see these productions on stage someday, because the music is truly delightful.

This wonderful book has changed the way I have viewed women in prison. Most of the women in this book suffered from one or several of factors like drug and sexual abuse, domestic violence, low self esteem, and even the loss of a loved one. The amazing thing is that every woman in this book has achieved their individual aspirations and goals while in prison or upon her release. I loved the story of Nancy Birkla who was convicted of drug dealing and served 7 years in York Correctional Institition. What is remarkable is what she acheived after her release. She earned a college degree with a perfect 4.0 grade point average in human services. She later worked as a coordinator for an agency that provides life skills counseling, housing and job opportunities to adults with developmental disabilities. I enjoyed reading the story of Barbara Parson Lane who was convicted of killing her husband after he sexually molested his step grand daughter. She became involved in a variety of interesting pursuits while incarcerated like working in a program in which inmates train Labrador retrievers to assist adults and children with special needs. This incredibly ambitious woman also studies computers, journalism, and yoga.I loved the story of Brenda Medina who was convicted for her participation in a gang related killing as a teenager. She has become a bilingual tutor and has taught Hispanic inmates to read, speak, and write English. Brenda also serves a reporter, photographer and editor for the inmate newsletter. Bonnie Foreshaw was the first person convicted for the murder of a pregnant woman in Connecticut which was an accident. She actively supports and is involved in anti violence and literacy groups.The story of Diane Bartholomew is very moving too. She was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused through her twenty four year marriage. She later experienced a breakdown which led her to shoot and kill her husband. However her life did not end there. She later earned a bachelors degree in social work with hopes of becoming a mental health counselor Diane even fought a courageous battle with breast cancer while in prison.This book is filled with hard luck stories about women who have endured great adversity in their lives. It is written so truthfully as each story tugs at your emotions. I enjoyed it very much.

The title The Year Of Magical Thinking is a reference to the year of 2004 in which author Joan Didion spent a year learning how to live and function again after a heart attack claimed the life of her husband John Gregory Dunne on December 30, 2003. Didion is a state of denial about her husband's death in the beginning of the year. There is one touching part of the book where she refuses to give away her husband's shoes, because she thinks her husband will return and might wear them again. Joan Didion's only daughter a young woman and newlywed named Quintana was also hospitalized and very sick at the same time her husband passed away. She started out with just having the flu which led to pneumonia. She eventually went into a condition called septic shock in which a person has very low blood pressure. Their organs start to fail as a result, and they go into a state of coma. I felt kind of sad reading about her daughter's illness, and I wish Didion spent more time talking about her daughter's personal life. While I was reading this book, I wanted to know more her daughter and if she had a career of her own, but Didion mainly focuses on her daughter's illness.The loss of her husband and the illness of her daughter made it impossible for Didion to concentrate on her work. There is a moving part in this book in which she describes how she felt on July 26, 2004. It was the day her daughter's first wedding anniversary. Didion remembers in very vivid detail how happy she felt a year ago and how sad she felt back then because her daughter was so sick.Joan Didion and her husband John had much success as writers. I enjoyed reading about their literary achievements both collaboratively and individually. The death of her husband was not only the loss of her spouse, but also it meant the loss of a working partner too. Together, they wrote the screenplay for the movie Up Close and Personal. They also worked on a book together entitled Play It As It Lays. This was also turned into a movie about a former model who had an abortion that she later had regrets about. They also travelled around the world to places like Honolulu Hawaii, Paris, Bogota Colombia, and Indonesia for work and pleasure. I felt kind of envious as Didion describes the beauty of these places.I enjoyed reading The Year Of Magical Thinking, because it is about a subject that most people do not like to talk about, and that is loss and death. Didion is an excellent writer. She shares with the reader her grief and pain of her loss, but she also gives a portrait of her husband as being a very talented writer. I loved this book.

I bought this CD right after I saw Glory Road today. My favorite track is People Get Ready by Alicia Keys. This is a great song about how if we have faith in God anything is possible. I loved her soulful delivery on this song very much. The title track Glory Road is very uplifting. I love the choir singing on this track. I also enjoyed the track entitled I Will Make The Darkness Light. This is such a moving song about fighting for what you believe in. Alicia sounds so sexy on this song. There are also some classic R and B songs like Twist and Shout, Uptight, and Dancing In The Street. These are delighful songs to listen and move to. There is a song by Otis Redding entitled I've Been Loving You Too Long To Stop Now. This is a heartfelt sincere love song, and it is one of my favorites. This is a wonderful soundtrack.

Rod Stewart sounds superb on this third installment of the Great American song book. This is a perfect CD to listen and forget all your troubles to. My favorite song is Isn't It Romantic. I think this is the perfect song to dance the night away to with your sweetheart. Rod puts his own unique spin on a classic song from the 50's entitled Blue Moon. Eric Clapton's smooth guitar playing paired with Rod Stewart dreamy vocals make this song a delight. I also enjoyed his rendition of the song For Sentimental Reasons. It is a very romantic song and one of my favorites. Rod sings some excellent duets on this album. My favorite duet is the duet he sings with Bette Midler entitled Manhattan. Bette has such a smooth voice. Rod's classic raspy sexy voice compliments her so well on this track.Baby It's Cold Outside is another excellent duet. It is interesting to hear a country star like Dolly Parton and a pop star like Rod Stewart perform this great jazz standard. I really liked it. Rod sounds very warm and engaging especially on the song Night and Day. The piano playing sounds so good on this track. What a Wonderful World is a very a pretty song with an excellent mini harmonica solo by Stevie Wonder. I really enjoyed listening this album. This CD is a musical treat as were the first two.

Madeleine Peyroux has a beautiful voice. I think she is a talented songwriter and musician too. I love every track on this album. I also think that her band members sound great on their instruments too. I love the first track I'm All Right. It is a great song that celebrates being single. The Summer Wind and La Javanaise are two tracks that celebrate being in love. A Little Bit is an upbeat engaging song about how people fall in love by chance and hope. The title track is about a person changes socially and emotionally in different stages in life. The piano playing is so good here. The violin playing on La Javanaise gives this track such a romantic quality. Blue Alert is an excellent track. The trumpet playing by Till Bronner is very smooth. He compliments Madeleine's subtle vocals and guitar playing well. Looking For The Heart of Saturday Night and Everybody's Talkin are two songs that celebrate freedom and spending time with someone special. Once In A While is a song about a relationship that didn't work out, and the feelings a person attaches to it. River is a pretty duet with KD Lang. This is a bitter sweet song about losing someone special. Smile is just a sweet song about how a smile makes a person feel better. This CD is filled with beautiful music.

I love the music of Dan Fogelberg. His voice is so soothing yet powerful. He defined the easy listening soft rock music in the the late 70s and 80s with his string of hits like "Longer" and "Make Love Stay". However, My favorite track is "Leader Of The Band" from 1981. It is a tribute to his father and this song reminds me of the feelings I have for my dad. I also love "Run For The Roses". This is a lovely song about a horse. Auld Lang Syne is an excelllent track about running into an old girlfriend. I also love the track "Rhythym of The Rain". This is an old Neil Sedaka hit, but Dan makes this song his own with his beautiful vocals. Dan Fogelberg is gone, but his music will live on forever.

Life of Pi is a great novel about a zookeeper's son named Pi Patel. He survives the sinking of a ship and floats for 227 days in a lifeboat. Aboard the lifeboat with him is a 450 pound tiger named Richard Parker, a mischievious hyena, and a docile zebra. I enjoyed reading about ther personalities of these animals and how they physically clashed together.What is interesting is how Pi's attitude towards the tiger changes through the book. He is initially afraid of the tiger in the beginning. As he begins to care for and feed the tiger, his fear disappears though. Richard Parker becomes Pi's companion as caring for the tiger and ensuring his survival becomes his main purpose in life. He develops an attitude of toughness and bravery that I liked. There are many interesting facts about animals in this book. I learned that tigers emit a friendly roar called prusten. I also learned that a turtle has many different uses. A turtle can be an excellent source of food. In addition, the turtle shell can be an effective shield for protection against tigers and used as a bowl for eating. Pi Patel experiences absolute joy in the smallest of things when he finally discovers fresh drinking water. Pi entertains himself by fishing and survives by fish, turtle, and even shark. There is such a great transformation in Pi Patel's personality about his situation from fear and loneliness in the beginning to a sense of courage and resliency at the end. I enjoyed it very much.

I love the music of The Travelling Wilburys on the two discs here. I also enjoyed watching the videos on the DVD. "Handle With Care" and "End Of The Line" are my favorite tracks. I love George Harrison singing lead vocals on these classic tunes. "She's My Baby" is an excellent rock and roll song. I love Jeff Lynne's electric guitar playing on this track. "The Wilbury Twist" is a fun upbeat track. I love Tom's Petty's vocals. Not Alone Any More is another highlight here. Roy Orbison's voice is so heartfelt on this track. Bob Dylan shines on the tracks "Inside Out" on "Dirty World". He is the member of the group I knew least about. He is a very good singer. "New Blue Moon" is a perfect example of how well these musicians sound together. This is fun music.

Tony Bennett duets with the some of the biggest names in music. My favorite track is "Who Can I Turn To When Nobody Needs Me". Tony sings this song with Queen Latifah. This song is very soothing. It is refreshing to hear a softer side of this rap star. "The Lady Is a Tramp" is an engaging duet with Lady Gaga. She sounds playful here. This song is a delightful surprise. I love the sax playing on this song. "One More For My Baby And One More For The Road" is a song I can see myself listening to with a friend while enjoying a drink in a bar. Amy Winehouse lends her vocal talents on the song "Body And Soul". Her vocals have a pleasant jazzy quality. The piano playing is beautiful on this song. Yesterday I Heard The Rain is a song featuring a singer named Alejandro Sanz. This song is sung partly in Spanish. It is a lovely language to listen to. The horns playing on the song are just superb. "On The Sunny Side Of The Street" featuring Willie Nelson. The guitar playing on this track is smooth and such a treat to listen to. "Stranger In Paradise" is a song featuring Andrea Bocelli. Andrea's voice is very uplifting. "How Do You Keep The Music Playing" is a classic song featuring Aretha Franklin. Her soulful voice matches Tony's voice perfectly on this song. Carrie Underwood sings on the song "It Had To Be You". This song is very pretty and romantic. Carrie can sing anything flawlessly. "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" is a song with Michael Buble. I like the upbeat tone of this song. "Blue Velvet" is a song I can relax to at the end of the day. KD Lang and Tony sound so smooth singing together. The music on this CD is very enjoyable.

I enjoyed this book very much. The Secret Life Of Bees is a wonderfully written book with memorable characters and an interesting historical setting. The novel is set in the state of South Carolina in 1964 which coincided with the passage of the Civil Rights Act.The main character is a young white teenage girl named Lily Owens who goes on a search to learn about the mother she lost at the age of 4. Lily blames herself for accidently shooting her mother and blames herself for her death. Lily begins this quest by looking a picture that belonged to her mother of a black Madonna with a name of a town in South Carolina on the back of it.Lily spends the summer with three black sisters who are in the business of making honey. Each of these characters have such distinct character traits that I enjoyed. I found that I possess a few of these traits myself. I loved the strong gentle character August who becomes a mother figure to Lily. May is the stoic often depressed sister. June is the sister who is afraid to let love come into her life.Zach Taylor is a young black teenager who is thrown in jail after standing by his friend after an incident with a group of white men. It is also interesting that Zach is Lily's friend and love interest in this book, because in the early 1960's inter racial relationships were not easily accepted.I absolutely loved the character of Rosaleen who is Lily's housekeeper. She is a strong proud black female character who makes no apologies for her actions. Rosaleen is on her way to register herself to vote at the beginning of the novel. She is confronted and taunted by 3 white men. She then spits on their shoes in response to their behavior She is subsequently beaten by them and thrown in jail. This is just one of the great examples of how unjust life was really like during the early 60's in the South for black people.The Secret Life of Bees is a novel of fiction. However, it is set in a context that is very real and relevant though. The relations between people of different races will always be an important one. The Secret Life of Bees is a novel with memorable, complex characters. I loved it.

This is another great CD from Jewel. Again and Again is my favorite track. It is simply a very pretty love song. The title track is an excellent coming of age song about being an adult and accepting the reality of it. Good Day is another standout track here on this album. This song is about having a sense of peace and being content with your life. Jewel picks up the tempo with the track Only One Too. Her guitar playing has a nice rock edge to it. Satelite is an interesting song about what it means to enjoy the finer things in life. I love Jewel's obsevations on this song. Stephenville Tx is a very personal song about how her life has changed since she met her real life boyfriend who used to compete in rodeo events. 1000 miles Away is another highlight here. It is a song about being separated from someone you love. Jewel hits the high notes beautifully on this song. Words Get In the Way and Fragile Heart are two songs about how difficult it is to make a relationship work. I really enjoyed listening to the music on this CD, and I recommend it to anyone.

Shania Twain is one of the best female singers around. This CD has most of her hits. My favorite song is Man! I feel like a Woman. This song really rocks and gets me going. Another highlight track for me is the song That Don't Impress Me Much. I love the lyrics to this song very much, because I think what really matters is a person's personality and character and not what they have in terms of material possessions. I also like the song I'm Going Getcha You Good too from the smash album UP.Shania Twain sings the best love songs. I especially enjoy the songs You're Still The One, and At This Moment. These are very beautiful songs that were big hits on both the country and pop charts. Shania's voice is heartfelt and sincere on her love songs. I think that is part of her huge appeal.Shania sings a new duet entitled Party for Two with newcomer Billy Currington on this album. This is a very playful and flirty song that I loved. She also sings this song with Sugar Ray front man Mark McGrath. I enjoyed both versions of this song.The song Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under is a real crowd pleaser at her concerts. It is a very lively song that gets the audience on their feet. This CD is an excellent greatest hits album. I recommend this CD to anyone who loves good music.

I enjoyed The Namesake very much. Jhumpa Lahiri writes with such detail in a rather short novel just under 300 pages. The significance of names, the process of making a life in the United States after living in India, and trying to preserve the native Indian culture are just some of the important and interesting themes in this book.The main character in the novel is a young man named Gogol. The book covers Gogol's life from birth to age 32. Gogol gets into romantic relationships and out of them very quickly. I think this pattern of people falling in and out of love is something not only myself but others can relate to.Gogol is named after the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol whom his father admires very much. The reason his son is named Gogol is because when his father survives a bad train accident, he is holding a page of the author by the same name which helps him get rescued. This is a very emotional moment told in the first pages of this book It really hooked and sparked my interest in the powerful way Jhumpa Lahiri writes.I enjoyed reading the transformation Gogol's mother Ashima makes. She is a young, scared, jobless, dependent woman at the beginning of the novel. She becomes a strong, self reliant, employed woman at the end of the book.I loved the names of the characters the author uses in this novel. Each Indian name in this novel has a interesting meaning to it. I loved reading about the different names in this book. Ashoke, Gogol's father's name means he who transcends grief. Gogol mother is named Ashima which means limitless without borders. Gogol takes a formal name when he starts school. He is named Nikhil which means he who is entire, emcompassing all.The author describes an India where people boil rice and shampoo their hair on the sidewalk. Commuters in India. threaten to committ suicide by jumping from buses and trams too. The Namesake is a very entertaining book by a talented writer.

Amore is the first CD I ever bought that contains music from various languages, and I love it. I was fortunate to find the English translations to these songs. I enjoy them a lot more now that I understand what Andrea is singing about. Amore is the Italian word for love and the music on CD is absolutely lovely. Producer David Foster did a great job putting the musical arrangements on each of these tracks.My favorite track is Besame Mucho. This song is about the power and the meaning behind a kiss. Andrea's vocals on this song are so sensual. Amapola is a sweet simple song about comparing the beauty of the poppy flower to the feelings of love a person can have for someone else. Jurame is another highlight on this CD. I enjoyed the upbeat tempo of this track very much. La Appuntamento is a lovely Italian song about waiting for a loved one to arrive. I really enjoyed the guitar playing accompanying Andrea on this track. I think it sounds very romantic. Sovios Novios is an excellent Spanish duet featuring Christina Aguilera. It is about the ups and downs of a couple in love. Can't Help Falling in Love is one of the prettiest songs of all time, and I love the way Andrea sings it. Solamente Una Vez is a beautiful song about what it feels like to fall in love only once in your life and to remember it forever. I enjoyed this CD very much, and I would recommend it to anyone.

I really enjoyed listening to this CD. Every song is different and sounds so good. I love The Los Lonely Boys unique sound called Tex Mex which is a combination of country, blues, and rock music. The best track is the hit song Heaven. It is a feel good song that will get you moving. Onda is another highlight on this album. Henry sounds just like guitar legend Carlos Santana on this excellent instrumental track. More Than Love is a very pretty song. The Los Lonely Boys really harmonize well on this track.Senorita is a great song about how tempting a beautiful woman can be. Los Lonely Boys really rock on this track. I loved it. Dime Mi Amor is another one of my favorite songs. I liked the Spanish lyrics on this song. I think The Los Lonely Boys do a great job of singing both English and Spanish on this song. Hollywood is a laid back easy listening song about following the dream of becoming an actor. It is very optimistic and positive. Crazy Dream is an awesome track performed in a nice blues style. I had so much fun listening to this CD.

This is a very good new album from Shawn Colvin. Fill Me Up and So Good To See You are two very good songs about the need for warmth and friendship in lonely times. Shawn sounds great vocally, and she plays the guitar so effortlessly. The Bird is another standout track here. This is a beautiful song about the need to get away from the stress of daily life and to reflect on what is important. The title track is about how a person can feel so trapped and frustrated in life that death seems like the only option. This song is very powerful. Tuff Kid is another excellent song about survival and overcoming obstacles in life. The violin playing gives this song a very upbeat quality. Shawn covers a Bee Gee classic entitled Words on this album. Her rendition of this song is very romantic. Let It Slide is an excellent song. It is about how no relationship is smooth and perfect. Summer Dress is a bittersweet song about saying good bye to a friend. I'm Gone is a highlight track with a nice blues sound. This is an excellent CD from Shawn Colvin filled with moving songs.

This is an excellent CD of the best music from Pixar movies. I love the hit song "Real Gone" from Sheryl Crow. It really gets me going. I also love the new track "Carl Goes Up" by Michael Giacchino. It is very adventurous and grand sounding. Michael's other beautiful track is entitled "Wall Rat" from "Ratatouille". I also love Randy Newman's vocals on his contributions here. "You've Got A Friend in Me" and "The Time of Your Life" are great songs. I love the pretty French song "Le Festin" from Camille, and I enjoyed the heroic sounding In Credits from The Incredibles. I also love the jazzy sounding music from "Monsters" and upbeat track "Colette Shows Him the Le Ropes". I love all the tracks on this CD.

I love the diversity of songs on this album. My favorite track on this CD is Over My Head by The Fray. I love the beat of this song, and I think the piano playing is excellent. Put Your Records On is a light soothing track from talented British singer Corrine Bailey Rae. This song makes me want to kick and relax. Another highlight on this album is Jesus Take The Wheel by Carrie Underwood. I love her beautiful voice. Black Horse and Cherry Tree by KT Tunstall just makes me want to get up and dance. Be Without You is a heart wrenching R and B love song by Mary J. Blige. Save Room is a very smooth R and B love song from John Legend. Waiting On The World to Change is an excellent track from John Mayer. I love his vocals and guitar playing on this track. I'll admit that some of these tracks like Bad Day and You're Beautiful are a bit overplayed on the radio, but I still enjoyed this CD very much.

I love this new album from Bon Jovi. Jon sounds a lot softer than I am used to hearing him, but that is okay with me. My favorite track is Jon's duet with Leeann Rimes. "Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore" is an excellent song about the difficulty of maintaining a relationship between two people. "Summertime" is a track about having fun and kicking back with friends. This is the perfect tune for the summer season. I love the title track too. This song is about how life is a journey and an adventure. "Any Other Day" is another strong track. I love Jon's guitar playing and vocals on this song very much. This song is about getting through the grind of daily life. "You Want To Make A Memory" and "Seat Next To You" are two sweet love songs.

It is a tribute for all the people who work long and hard doing physical labor. Wreck This Heart is a song about a person trying to deal with the pressures of family and work.

Clay Aiken is my favorite American Idol, so I had to go out and get this CD. He has such a great voice, and he sings all of these Christmas standards well. My favorite track is Hark the Herald Angels Sing. Clay really shows the power and range of his voice. I like the song Joy To the World a lot here too. Clay sounds like he's having so much fun singing this song. He has an easy listening pleasant voice especially on songs like Sleigh Ride and Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.Another standout track is O Holy Night. Clay sings this song just beautifully in an appropriate solemm tone that I love.Clay sings two new Christmas songs on this CD that are excellent. Mary, Did you Know is a spiritual song about all the miracles Jesus Christ did. You don't have to be a Christian to enjoy this track though. This song is very moving and definitely one of my favorites on this CD. This is simply an awesome CD of Christmas music.

I love this disc, because I grew up on the music of the Jackson 5. There are classic hits on here like "I Want You Back", "I'll Be There", "The Love You Save", "ABC" and "Dancing Machine". There are songs on here that weren't hit songs, but they are still great. Just A Little Bit Of You is a good example. This song is not that well known, but I love listening to this song. "I Wanna Be Where You Are" is another lesser known song that I like on here. Mike sounds great with his brothers. I love the music on this disc.

This is an excellent musical score by John Ottman. He really takes the listener on an emotional rollercoaster. I love the track Main Title Superman theme. This track makes me feel brave and fearless. Bank Job is a nice track that conveys a sense of evil wrongdoing. Little Secrets and Power of the Sun conveyed the emotion of wonder and discovery. I could feel the tension mounting on the track Rough Flight. I felt a feeling of dread listening to the track So Long Superman. Another good track is Not Like The Train Set. I felt a sense of danger and struggle here. I really liked the track Fly Away. It sounds so peaceful and romantic. Saving The World has a very heroic and noble feel to it. I enjoyed listening to this score very much.

This is an excellent soundtrack to a great movie. The best song is Accidently in Love by the Counting Crows. It is a cute playful song that fits the movie well. This CD has songs from artists I've never even heard of. I loved the song As Lovers Go by Dashboard Confessional. I really liked it, because I thought it sounded romantic. The duet Livin La Vida Loca by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas is a very funny version of the popular song. Butterfly Boucher sounds really good covering the David Bowie classic Changes. Bowie actually sings on a cover of his own song which I thought was neat. I really like the song Holding Out for a Hero. Jennifer Saunders really sings this song well, because she has such a powerful voice. I'm On My Way is a pleasant song by Rich Price. I think he has a sexy voice.Little Drop of Poison is a sexy song. I think it is a good song to slow dance to if you have a partner. Funkytown is a great disco classic and a good addition to this soundtrack. People Aint No Good is a sad song sung with a lot of emotion. I really liked it too. Shrek 2 is a fun soundtrack with a nice variety of songs. I loved it!

I have been a Billy Joel fan all my life. I would have loved to have seen him in concert in Madison Square Garden. This 2 disc set of live performances is probably the closest I'll ever get to seeing him live. Most of his biggest hits on here. I enjoyed classic songs like Movin Out, Big Shot, New York State of Mind, and Piano Man. However, I think that some of his biggest hit songs are not included here like Honesty, Uptown Girl, You're Only Human, and Pressure, but I guess these songs are not as popular as the ones he performed. Billy Joel has always been able to identify with the common working man, and I think this is why he has lasted so long. One of my favorite tracks is Downeaster Alexa. This song is a tribute to his daughter and to the many fishermen who struggle each day to make a living. Another excellent working man song is Billy's hit from 1982 entitled Allentown. I also enjoyed the track Vienna. This is a lesser known but very lovely song about trying to slow to enjoy life. Always A Woman is a beautiful love song that won the Grammy for best song in 1979. Overall, I think Billy sounds great vocally and on the piano here. The musicians in his band are excellent too.

Puss in Boots is an animated movie that makes me believe that a pussy cat and an egg can be best friends. Antonio Banderas provides the voice of Puss. Zach Galifianakis is the voice of Humpty Dumpty. They are two characters who grew up together in the film. Their bond of friendship is fun to watch develop in the movie. The story of Puss in Boots is actually based on a French fairy tale about a cat with a talent for stealing things. The plot of the movie centers around Puss and Humpty searching for magic beans. These magic beans grow into a bean stalk that leads to a giant's castle. Inside the castle is a goose that lays golden eggs. Nursery rhyme characters Jack and Jill are the villains in the film. Only the movie makers of Dream Works can breathe life and personality into these two characters. I love the creative license of the animators. There are two things about the movie that make it special. The animation and music are excellent. My favorite scene has Puss sword fighting and dancing with a female cat named Kitty Soft Paws. She is voiced by Selma Hayek. This scene in the movie is very funny. I love the simple scenes of the movie. One scene has Puss riding a horse in the back drop of a setting sun. The film is scored by composer Henry Jackman. His music gives the movie a sensual latin flair. There is a track of music in the film entitled "The Puss Suite". This piece of music sounds so uplifting and heroic. Rodrigo Y Gabriela are two latin guitar musicians. They perform a track entitled "Diablo Rojo" in the film. This instrumental is upbeat and beautiful to listen to. Puss In Boots is a very entertaining animated film. I like every aspect of it.

Milk is an excellent movie. Sean Penn gives a moving performance as city supervisor and gay rights activist Harvey Milk. I love Gus Van Sant's direction. The shots of San Francisco's Castro district in the seventies. look very authentic. I love the candlelit vigil shot at the end of the movie. The performances by everyone in this movie are so good. I love James Franco in his role as Harvey Milk's boyfriend. Josh Brolin plays rival Dan White perfectly. I love Danny Elfman's score and the songs "Everyday People" and "Rock The Boat". Everything about the film is flawless. I can't wait for the DVD.

I learned a lot about salt from reading this book. Salt has been a symbol of preservation, power, oppression, health and wealth. Kurlansky takes the reader for a trip around the world to places like China, England, India the Middle East, and all over Europe to show how salt was found, made, used and valued.There are all kinds of information in this book. Salt was used to not only preserve food and also human bodies. Salt was used to make gunpowder. It has also been used to deice roads in the United States. Ancient people in China and Egypt got salt by evaporating seawater. People in Mexico evaporated urine and burned plants to extract salt. I learned a lot about geography and places like Parma and the Po River in Italy where Parma cheese was first made. I learned that the area around the Dead Sea was not only a great source of salt, but also a tourist attraction with hotels and health spas.I did not know people died for salt in the Civil War. Millions of slaves died making salt in mines and wells. The South actually lost the war because it could not produce enough salt to feed their armies. Making salt was a way to actually avoid military service. Salt became a symbol for all the injustices of government. By the late 18th century more than 3000 French men women or children were sentenced to prison or even death for crimes like smuggling against the salt tax called the gabelle. Women hid salt in their breasts, clothing, and even their posteriors. Smuggling was also widespread in China where the salt smuggler was seen as a hero fighting the evil salt administration. The gardens of one Chinese province has become a tourist attraction because of the salt smugglers. The British controlled the use, production, and the cost of salt in India until Gandhi's historic salt march in 1930 in which he defied British law by merely picking up some salt off a beach.This book is also filled with many interesting recipes using salt with ingredients like sauerkraut, anchovies, salted beef, and honey. This is a wonderful book, because it covers so many interesting subjects. This book makes salt fascinating.

This is a wonderful addition to the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. One of my favorite stories is A Visit With My Parents. It is about a Peace Corps Volunteer living in the Philippines. The parents of the young woman seemed to have a greater appreciation of life. They also gained a broader perspective as well simply after experiencing how hard a Flipino family worked doing daily manual labor. They also experienced how this family lived with no electricity, plumbing, or beds which was an eye opener for them.I was also touched by the story Road to Reconcilliation. This is a touching story about a man who lost his leg in the Vietnam War. This man had such bitterness toward his loss until he met a Vietnamese man in a sporting event for veterans. Tran Van Son lost not only his leg but also and his entire family. These two men become fast friends and eventually run the New York Marathon together.I was touched by the story The Nicholas Effect. This is the story about a young boy who dies in a car accident. The majority of his organs were donated giving life to numerous people. I loved the story Earning My Wings. It is about a compassionate flight attendant who assists a young woman with a baby with clothes and food during a flight. Another story that sticks out in my mind is A Fair Price. This is a wonderful story about how an American college student working in Kenya building classrooms encourages an African man to tell his wife that he loves her for the first time.Every story in this book is so touching and inspiring. I learned a lot about different places by reading. Chicken Soup for the Traveller's Soul is a winner.

This is an unusual soundtrack. It combines instrumental music with opera music. This disc also has two songs from popular singers. I love the track "Sway" by Michael Buble. I also enjoyed the track "Mambo Gelato" These two tracks make me want to grab someone and dance. The opera tracks on this disc are excellent. The best of the bunch is "La Donna E Mobile" by Joseph Calleja. This track is very uplifting and playful. "Cielo E Mar" is a romantic sounding track from Pavarotti. "Nessum Dorma" is a really soothing track from Pavarotti too. He has such a powerful voice. Philip Glass is a talented composer for the film. I love his instrumental restaurant theme here. It is a beautiful piece of music. "Count On My Love" is a great song that fits the tone of the movie well. I really enjoyed listening to the music on this soundtrack.

Chicken Soup from the Soul of Hawaii is a wonderful book. I have lived in Hawaii for 20 years, and I still learned so much about Hawaii. Reading this book is like taking a tour of the Hawaiian islands. This book has stories by celebrities like Kelly Preston and Bo Derek, but I enjoyed the stories about the local legends and regular people more. One story that sticks out is about the legendary swimmer and surfer Duke Kahanamoku who designed and popularized the first aloha shirts in the 1930's. I was also inspired by the story of Hao Dang who found freedom in Hawaii after spending 3 months on the ocean and living in a Thai refugee camp. Today this young woman supervises 150 employees as a director of housekeeping for 2 of the biggest hotels on the Big Island. I was enjoyed the contributions of local entertainer Nalani Olds who submitted an interesting story about the history of the Royal Hawaiian Band. Olds also submitted a story about a former prison inmate who turned his life around to become a counselor. I loved the inspirational story of Kanalu Young who was paralyzed in a swimming accident as a teenager. He went on to earn a doctorate in history. He is now a professor of Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii I enjoyed reading about the story of Angela Perez Baraquio who became the first Asian to win Miss America in the pageant's 80 year history. This book is also very educational. I only knew 3 Hawaiian words before reading this book. I learned many more Hawaiian words like Lokahi which means unity and H'ookipa which means to interact or share. Chicken Soup from the Soul of Hawaii is entertaining, informative and inspirational. I enjoyed it very much.

Songs In A Minor is a modern classic. "Piano & I" establishes Alicia as a talent on the piano. I love the groovy track "Girlfriend". Alicia's piano playing and vocals are so soulful on the track "Fallin". "A Woman's Worth" and "Jane Doe" are such smooth tracks. "Troubles" is a very sensual sounding track. "Rock Wit You" has a great beat and bass line. I love this song. "Caged Bird" is a beautiful sweet song. Every track is excellent on this disc.

Lonely Runs Both Ways is a very good CD. I bought this CD because I enjoyed her work on the hit soundtrack O Brother Where Art Though Allison Krauss is a talented musician and vocalist. She really shows it on this CD.My favorite song is the first single Restless. It is a great song about how someone can feel so lonely and be always on the run. Allison has such a beautiful and sensitive voice. I really felt the compassion in her voice on this song. Another highlight song for me is If I Didn't Know Any Better. It is a very pretty love song. Unionhouse Branch is a very good bluegrass song. Allison's fiddle playing on this track is so impressive. This song will definitely get you on your feet.Pastures of Plenty features Allison's bandmate Ron Block on excellent vocals and banjo. I loved this song. It is about how we should work hard to preserve the beauty of the environment in the United States.Crazy as Me is a track that shows Allison's skill on the acoustic guitar. It is a song about being fed up with all of the lies and deception people bring into relationships sometimes. I think this is one of the best songs on this album because of the lyrics. Allison Krauss makes bluegrass music sound cool. She is a very talented singer with a great band. I really enjoyed this CD.

The King of Queens is still the one of the funniest shows on TV. I loved watching the second season on DVD. Kevin James and Leah Remini have great chemistry as a married couple, and Jerry Stiller is so funny as Arthur. The story lines on the show are so funny and simple. My favorite episode is the one about how Doug and Carrie meet for the first time. The episode where Doug tries so hard to rekindle the romance in his marriage by giving Carrie flowers is very funny too. I also loved the episode where Doug takes Arthur to a baseball game after he accidently hurts his feelings. Jerry Stiller is just hillarious in the episode where Arthur gets a job managing a pretzel shop. I also enjoyed the episode where Doug buys a RV trailer and argues with Carrie about where to go on vacation. Victor Williams, who plays Deacon Palmer on the show is Doug's best friend and a perfect supporting cast member. One of the funniest episodes of season 2 is where Doug and Deacon go to Atlantic City to go gambling.This DVD does not include interviews with the cast members like on the 1st season DVD, but it does have a feature called A Day in the Life of Kevin James. It shows Kevin James going on various talk shows like Conan and Regis and Kelly and having fun playing baseball. This extra feature shows that Kevin James is such a nice person in real life. This DVD is really fun to watch. I can't wait until the 3rd season of the show is released on DVD.

The voice of Paul Potts gives me chicken skin. He really hits the high notes on the tracks "Nessum Dorma", "Caruso", and "You Lift Me Up." His voice is very uplifting. "Time To Say Good Bye" is a very pretty song. "Cavatina" is a beautiful song. The guitar playing accompanies Paul's subtle vocals nicely here. I also love Paul's rendition of "Music Of The Night" from Phantom Of The Opera "Everybody Hurts" is a hit song from REM. Paul makes this song his own by giving it a beautiful operatic sound. "Amapola" and "My Way" are very soothing songs. This is the perfect disc to play after a stressful day and relax to. I love the voice of Paul Potts.

This is a good soundtrack filled with good music. I loved the songs Love Is a Battlefield, Crazy for You Tainted Love, and Burning Down the House. These are all hit songs from the 80's. I even liked the songs by Belinda Carlisle included here Head Over Heels and Mad About You. Her songs are always fun to listen to. The song Thriller is not on the soundtrack which really should have been. It was played in the movie during one of the most enjoyable scenes. I wish the original version of What I Like About You was included here. The cover song by Lillix included here is ok, but it is not as good as the one sung by the Romantics. I still enjoyed listening to this soundtrack though.
