Well I can't deserve the maximum rate, as for the presence of a typical british progrock-like musical breakthrough ,including the choice of the sounds, too much similar to "Brain salad surgery" by ELP and some "Emerson-like" pompous style as well. Naturally They are german, but it doesn't seem...anyway track no 3, track no 4 and the major part of the following compositions as well, are well worth checking out (listen to their splendid piano intro and the following insert of their rhytmical sections as well of track no 3, where the time signatures and also a lot of magical interplay create a splendid symphonic "wall". The recording was quite good and make this album recommended to all the fans of the best classic symphonic prog, based upon a keyboard oriented trio!!

Well this one was another turn of their career towards the end of their long-time musical excursion, but also a sad tribute to the memory of Tony Duhig: their last release will be dated 1993 -&quot;A distant echo&quot; (despite of their improvement in the compositions, the title is truly deserved once again,expecially regarding of the old good times!!)- But coming back to &quot;Breathing the storm&quot;, featuring Jon Field along with other two musicians, it is not an unmistakable work, expecially if you consider the tepid music construction of the keyboards backing ...it's a sort of more complex new-age composition, the music being as defined as the old albums, yet being less versatile and with a few spare styles, unlike their best prog efforts!! Besides the music is less immaginative in comparison to albums such as &quot;Floating world&quot;.Nevertheless, despite of such defects, their music starts recapturing the spirit of the period concerning the famous label Island: it's a relaxed approach, however any insightful fan can understand the new spirit and mood as well, concerning this totally different line-up ... Their new goal in fact is the attempt of reaching the catharsis of their several previous musical ideas,driven in a unique compact body. Well actually their old achievement, a succesfull combination of rock, classical music and &quot;wrapping&quot; japanese melodic lines, by means also of an oriental atmosphere plus some exotic percussions and a gentle flute as well, was very appreciated by their fans,but remaining anyway confined within a marginal and isolated prog scene. For this reason the old albums did not deserve the attention to be awarded and regarded as the most famous bands of the 70's prog scene. The present album and also the following ones naturally are conditioned by such pieces of evidence ...Recommended, even though not essential !!

Well this amazing album contains the mysterious title track, this one being characterized by the monumental intro at the mellotron and the voice poliphony as well; the fantastic epic track &quot;La luna nuova&quot;, characterized by a stunning Moog intro, followed by the best soloing at the guitar of F. Mussida, concerning his best stuff and long career too!! &quot;Dolcissima Maria&quot; is an awesome ballad, represented by an amazing melody, probably their best and sweetest as well, talking about their whole production !! &quot;Via Lumiere&quot; is the right conclusion for a memorable album (not bad also the english version of &quot;L'isola di niente&quot;:&quot;World became the world&quot;)Highly recommended!!

Well We were there in front of the stage(Vigevano Castle Square) with my band and followed carefully the acoustic performance, with an emotional feeling!! Unfortunately it was one of the last exemplar vocal performances in the acoustic set by John, afterwards some familiar accidents and other problems, affected his skill...Anyway despite of his renounce to prog music (since the last UK album)in order to compose more accessible mainstream/AOR albums, even if his voice has not been always clear like in the old times, John has anyway maintained a very good taste (the album &quot;Arkangel&quot; is a typical example).We hope to see Wetton with his friend Hackett together on stage!!

Well it's difficult to add something diverse, in comparison to such several opinions about this album with exotic moods, relaxing and pleasant atmospheres, almost in the vein of modern New-Age ... the elegant and distinctive sound of such Duhig brothers' guitars and the support of a pleasant flute as well, make this classic an original chapter of instrumental progressive rock, characterized also by some interesting breaks through,plus some stunning and heavy riffs, which earn a lot within this remastered version!I suggest this odd work to you,which is not a masterpiece but is always enjoyable ...

Well it's a pity for the excessive bombastic experimentations and technological effects of "Toccata" too; I'm a bit sorry for the long duration of the excellent suite Karn Evil 9, which is becoming more and more prolix after several listenings, expecially the second part...anyway the rest is enriched with some interesting solos taken from Ginastera and the beautiful epic theme of Jerusalem as well, another adaptation,arranged in a remarkable way!! "Still ... you turn me on" is a typical ballad according to G. Lake's romantic style ; instead "Benny the bouncer" is a classic jazz arrangement by Emerson, where Carl Palmer can show his ability at his jazzy drumming, reminding us of the exceptional work by Buddy Rich, his tutor and great friend too, with the B.R. Orchestra ...Highly recommended!! But before this, listen to the incomparable "Pictures at an exhibition", their famous adaptation from Mussorgsky

Despite of his declaration about his most important influences (Vangelis and Klaus Schulze),you can find a few bunches only regarding such style ...an higly strung violin along with an array of different moods, created by a soft wall of synths, make the atmosphere quite captivating;nevertheless the short length of the songs,which never reach the 2 minute duration, and the lack of complex arrangements as well, don't represent strictly a progressive stuff...yet the more acoustic tunes have got a certain appeal, after some repetitive listenings, and you can bear such a simple and not particularly inspiring album, as for its peaceful and relaxing mood,all over its duration, apart from its simple arrangement!! The problem connected with the present issue regards its heterogeneity or discontinuity too, due mainly to the fact this is a compilation album, featuring Bertrand Loreau in so many different steps of his career,which doesn't comply to a logical compact music narration. However,regardless such these remarks,at last the music palette is not bad in general... MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BY FRENCH MUSEA!!

Well you can add another half star at least, as for the pretty aspects of classical music and prog folk as well, in the tradition of the solo albums composed by Ian Anderson...Actually the present album is not equal for instance to "Divinities", but it's a good performance anyway; and of course it's strange that's a Jethro Tull album! The Christmas lyrics aren't so bad and the music is versatile enough...ok forget "Locomotive Breath" or "Aqualung" here, but naturally it's a Christmas Album and not a rock performance! Nevertheless the mood is right and the music gentle, sometimes in the vein of Rupi's Dance, not properly a swing album (regarding of a work dated 2003, however issued this way in the recent times), but I should say it's a kind of soft version or more "light jazzy" version of "Songs from the wood"...The instrumental numbers are always in the pretty tone of the sacred celebration of Christmas and that's coherently in accordance to such Ian's tradition, who likes to run the old path of the "classics" and without screaming...so this time there's no rock music in the J.T. composition and it's not a problem...at the end it could be worth a listen, once again!

Well after the disappointing "Vapor Trails", especially talking about its bad mixing, being too much loud (above all the distorted guitar by Lifeson), the authors of a couple of masterpieces within a couple of years (1977-1978) - such as "A Farewell to Kings" and "Hemisphere" - return with the present "S.& A.", after 5 years. It's a good album, not particularly inspired if you regard of the composition, except on the intelligent insert of a few strange instruments like a mandolin for instance, the Greek bouzouki and the Mellotrons (giving their album a 70's sound...) or considering also their effort to make the tunes more varied in comparison to their previous album.Therefore their short citation concerning "YYZ" from Moving Pictures inside "The Main Monkey Business" (this latter not properly equal, especially if you think of another exceptional instrumental number entitled "La Villa Strangiato"- from "Hemisphere" for example) or their attempt to make a surprising dejavous in "A Far Cry", with its typical chord like within the above mentioned "Hemisphere", let me think of an old band which tries to comeback to the origin, even though failing sometimes...nevertheles you can find some interesting breaks-through inside, often reminding me of "Counteparts"; and moreover their technical skill as well as the odd time signatures (like in their instrumental) let me stay and listen carefully to it!! Their attempt to make a renewal is quite intelligent, as They maintain the sound and in a certain sense the old 70's- 80's structures of the old songs as well, (just a little bit at least, as a stereotype...).At the end their new strategy consists of two goals, in my opinion naturally:1) Increasing their popularity2) Let the old fans captured by a few citations of their glorious past in order to bring them into the arenas!!Then consider their remarkable lyrics or once again the metaphor used by means of the snake and an arrow, symbolizing the fear an the violence (or the tremendous aggression if you prefer), which is well transmitted by their music.All these features, along with a good tune like "Armor And Sword or the opener mentioned above, make the present album an interesting work, even though not a must-have probably...make your own choice!!

Well this album, expecially the 22 minute suite (too much long and sometimes boring)&quot;Nine feet underground&quot;, has characterized the light Canterbury sound of a fascinating epoque for a long time (listen also to &quot;Moonmadness&quot; by Camel and, above all, to Rousseau &quot;Retreat&quot;, this german band being inspired by first Camel and classic light Canterbury very much, sometimes improving the easy canterburian sound). But actually if you listen to tracks like &quot;Lunar sea&quot; and &quot;the spirit of the water&quot; by Camel or the albums by Hatfield and the north, these latter being more experimental, you can skip &quot;In the land of...&quot; by Caravan!! However, despite of their importance, this work isn't always inpired (listen to the forgettable &quot;Love to love you&quot; or to &quot;Golf girl&quot;, where the crepuscolar tones of Sinclair's voice are boring!!); and for this reason the right rate should be 3 stars (I add 1 star because this work is influential)Recommended to the fans of Light Canterbury, but before check &quot;Moonmadness&quot; by Camel and Rousseau &quot;Retreat&quot;

Here you find almost the whole best stuff from Gentle Giant : immortal classics such as &quot;Proclamation&quot;, &quot;On reflection&quot;, &quot;Peel the paint&quot;,&quot;Free hand&quot;, this CD showing the grandeur of this prolific band(above all from the point of view of their creativity)...Usually I don't like medleys very much,expecially talking about the complex suites/songs of prog music, but in this case... well that one from &quot;Octopus&quot;, very well performed in this live as usual, is memorable, even if it's characterized by a &quot;smaller&quot; format, of course, than the original one.Once upon a time a fascinating ensemble from England, able to play such diverse instruments ... made us know their fantastic style, performing every single note of their baroque songs, during their solos !! They didn't use any sequencer, computer or other &quot;invention&quot; of modern technology ... this live being an important teachement to all the musicians and a lesson from the past as well !! Moreover the jazzy style of Gary Green, the strange time signatures, helped by the versatile drumming style of John Weathers, suitable for baroque music, make this live essential and well worth checking out...Another must have by GENTLE GIANT !!

Odd time signatures and a certain harmonic complexity as well characterize this album, probably their best one. The job at the moog by Zeus B. Held is reminiscent of such style by the keyboardplayer from Gentle Giant, Kenny Minnear,and moreover you can listen to three tracks at least, divided into several movements, like such mini suites,which are well worth checking out...the opener &quot;One first of April&quot; and the last track &quot;No time to dye&quot; too, are written off as main leading tracks. In particular the latter has a confident feeling and a stunning closing vocal section too, whose harmonies are in the vein of Yes...instead &quot;Beedeepees&quot; has a Gentle Giant mood,but also a complex and quite original structure, which is inspired by the same poliphonic passages from the english heroes of renaissance and baroque poliphony of the seventies.Besides &quot;Behind grey walls&quot; is reminiscent of the early Genesis,being romantic and solid in the same time... such a powerful track!! Then finally a diverse number- &quot;La Ciguena de Zaragoza&quot; - which is more jazzy, expecially at the end, where you find a tasty sax. Instead talking about the story, honestly the present concept album regarding the dramatic vicissitudes of a businessman and all his journeys, as long as He will be killed under a subway,is a bit tepid !! The meaning itself is without sense, but fortunately the instrumental parts are as much remarkable as those ones typical of the best 70's german space rock bands; and for this reason We can forgive them for such uninspiring story...This issue can complete your 70's german progressive rock collection... if you are into it, you won't be disappointed, regarding naturally of this definitive effort by Birth Control!!

Here is Gary Moore at his peak of career, expecially when He can perform a mini-suite like &quot;STAR MAIDEN/MYSTERIOSO/QUASAR&quot; by playing both acoustic and electric guitars, with a great skill, a certain creativity and originality as well. But also when He performs such a typical fusion, rock standard, He shows an aggressive and influential impact on the british guitarists, without forgetting the influence of the early Colosseum works, completely diverse!! A great fusion prog intro at the keyboards by Don Airey in the excellent title track, another memorable track(&quot;Inquisition&quot;) and other fine stuff as well!!Recommended also to the fans of fusion prog...

Well I don't wanna get you wrong,that is Hackett, Colbert and Thompson are still producing great music, instead John Wetton, even remaining an excellent musician and one of my old master in prog music, has decide to change radically route about his own musical projects. In fact he's making tasteful -not always inspired- pop and aor albums, but it seems He's not interested to prog music anymore (see also the failure concerning the reunion with Carl Palmer in the ensemble created with John Young - &quot;QANGO&quot;). Anyway this concert, whose digital production in DVD is excellent, will be pass to the &quot;hall of fame of the best rock concert&quot; and it's a special occasion to remind us of the great prog music produced by the 70's english bands like King Crimson and early Genesis! Moreover you can see in action great musicians like J.Colbert,Ian McDonald and C. Thompson, whose collaboration with Zappa, Wheather Report and son on,are a fine presentation!! Well I think of every prog fan being always involved when a splendid supergroup like this can perform live on stage some of the best 70's material. Instead when you listen to some pop hit by Asia and Wetton, which gets the set lighter, you remain interested, because the latter material is quite pleasant anyway, but you should like to listen to some other complex tracks of progressive music.This DVD is higly recommended!!

Well this box set is the most complete collection of Hackett's most famous songs and instrumental pieces of art music as well,concerning the important career of the most influential guitarist, along with Andy Latimer and Steve Howe, all over the world prog scene!! This collection -being so wide- can witness the exact shade of meaning concerning Hackett's several kinds of execution, including also the defects during his performance (usually He's almost perfect technically, but of course his creativity and taste as well are always perfect); but this fact doesn't affect the high quality of the present box set, where you can find immortal classics such as &quot;Please don't touch&quot;, &quot;Blood on the rooftops&quot;, &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; (the first 2 discs are taken from a concert in London)while &quot;Jacuzzi&quot; and &quot;Ace of wands&quot; come from a famous gig in Rome on 1981 ...the disc concerning the 90's activity of Steve is better recorded, even though the songs-apart from the splendid &quot;Take these pearls&quot;- are less interesting and not always inspiring. Nevermind!We forgive Steve for the presence of such tepid songs among several jewels, if you regard such moments as his break of inspiration: for this reason you can notice the duty He must pay, due to the necessary mainstream exigences, as an interlude between a complex part and the following easier section, suitable for the &quot;laity&quot; of prog music.Highly recommended!!

An obscured French-Canadian band from the middle-seventies, whose pastoral side (actually They were born as a light folk prog band) was always evident and all along their short career...a few hints of bluegrass seem to make a strange mix here, but you can also listen to a typical light progressive rock, with some improvisational breaks-through (almost within a kind of jazz-genre) as well as to an intelligent folk prog...Ok They could be the "alternative" Canadian version of Gryphon, sometimes reminding me of another Italian light prog band of the seventies, called Celeste; but honestly it seems They were quite personal in their music tastes anyway, as They created a style of their own, which can be "labelled" in a difficult manner...Serge Fiori was the mastermind of the ensemble (playing a lot of acoustic instruments and creating also some intelligent lyrics...); but you can't forget the soprano saxophone, the clarinet and the bass clarinet, always played by Pierre Daigneault, with the support of some other interesting musicians, whose target was not the virtuosic music, but rather the goal in painting a picture with beautiful and ligth colours, not so far away from the U.K. scene of Canterbury... well actually I think above all of the quieter moments within the music of A. Phillips, but also of those ones inside the music of Renaissance and PFM, usually settled into the progressive rock scene; but the musicians were able to maintain a music imprinting of their own, from the beginning to the end! Even though the length of the album was various (from the short song of 3 minutes and beyond, to the last 17-minutes suite, an epic number entitled "Histoires sans Paroles") and considering that the album was not characterized certainly by the delicate sound of thunder (think of the diverse style within "Running Hard" by Renaissance for instance), in any case the perfect Soft Romantic scene (a sort of clean environment, where the birds and the delicate petties only- can live together in harmony!!) was created by means of sweet and sometimes haunted melodies, with a great emotion and the typical sound of Mellotron too!!At the end- for the majority- it's an excellent addition to any prog rock music collection; instead for whom is more into the virtuosic aspect of prog music, probably the evaluation is "one star less"...but these latter fans either prefer new ELP clones for example or for sure think of Gentle Giant and Yes (do you remember the music of Myrthrandir for example, which was regarded as the best example of derivative music? Or again the modern Echolyn inside "Suffocating the Bloom" and After Crying from Hungary?...well forget the best complex music for a moment and relax with Harmonium!!)

Well probably this is one of the most unknown works by Frank Zappa, as well as one of the best performances - within a sort of progressive jazz - based on the best stuff by Coltrane and Miles Davis (moreover according to the stunning arrangement of a crazy superb musician like Frank). As a matter of fact here He plays with the band from a couple of great albums such as Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, giving the present I.D. an experimental jazz emphasis, enriched with amazing jam sessions - also by means of a tasteful "blues" guitar (listen to one of his best tracks entitled "Been to Kansas City"). Well I like the horn arrangements very much within this latter, but The Petit Wazoo in general represents the peek of a music genre, even though sometimes it's harsh, but often outstanding!! At the end I would always like to listen to his best style (I think for instance of an "Apostrophe" like theme inside, which is perhaps too much extended but it's quite incredible after all...), by forgetting a few weaker guitar lines and his prolix harmonic excursions too ,I regard this I.D. album as one of his "must-have" works for all seasons!!

Well, this is the work of the definitive "artistic maturity" for a great artist such as Miles Davis, whose "impact"- in the history of the best cool jazz music genre- is important so far!!For instance, here you find the first defined "fusion" experiments during his remarkable career in the sixties and- moreover-the improvisational moments upon the melodic structure and the repetitive sketches, which allow a kind of "reduction" concerning the music plot, represent some important features...even though- actually- the whole length should be over two hours, but the producer Teo Macero decided to cut down the duration to 80 minutes and then along with Miles even to 27 minutes: in fact at the end of the album divided into two sections, the main music phrases have been repeated twice, probably in order to let him play in a more concise manner... in particular here you find the most remarkable phrasing and also his trumpet is extraordinary."Shhh/Peaceful" is a great jam, enriched by means of a fine harmony, being supported by three keyboardists and the jam led by the guitarist and the sax player as well.As a matter of fact, the connections between several different elements , create a big contrast in the composition and also regarding of track#2- "In A Silent Way/It's About That Time"- which is different from the tune as it was originally written by J. Zawinul, characterized (as it was when He wrote the composition) by too many chords!At the end, the final section of It's About That Time" is a bluesy clever piece of work, with its amazing groove, which is splitted by everything that could be composed by Weather Report for instance...the repetitions inside allow such a reflective and intense moment of art, rather than being a more serious impediment to the music growth!Perhaps the present album could be essential also for a "purist" fan of fusion prog music, even though- basically this is a must-have for the lovers of the intelligent cool jazz!!

Unlike the album "Legacy", here you find the most balanced and moderate sound, in comparison to their frequent musical excesses of some previous works!! This 8th album, regardless of their lives, is characterized by pleasant symphonic atmospheres, within a complex new-prog sound, with echoes from Camel and early Genesis, talking about their inspiration and creativity too... well forget the originality !!But nevermind because the moderate use of the keyboards by Alfonso Vidales (listen to the opening song "Moving Universe")-unlike some albums such as "Legacy" and "Lagunas dos Volcanos"- and moreover the clever performance at the flute (supported by the guitarist, Hackett-oriented) make this album worth checking out ! The second section of the album is characterized by the title track, which is divided into 3 epic parts, and a pleasant song as well, where the singer gets involved in the vocal part, trying to emulate the best style of Wetton ... OK their production is wide, but the range of their compositions and ideas as well, sometimes lacking of inspiration , LET THE FANS OF SYMPHONIC PROG BE A BIT PERPLEX BUT NEVER DISAPPOINTED.Anyway if you prefer some more jazzy or a bit diverse sound, probably you will appreciate their previous album "Beyond Reality", nevertheless the rhythm is always frantic and the fast execution as well ... a repetitive trademark, regarding of their large production (apart from the darker album "Angel and Demons")

Don't get me wrong, this album is very well arranged and performed, nevertheless in my opinion Frypp&C.; are not able to change radically route. That is They have not been clever enough in order to make a true renewal of their sounds, regarding above all the original arrangements and the rational lay-out of the songs too:for instance the track "Elektrik" has the same dynamic range and arpeggios as well, typical of "Lark's tongue in aspic"; "Eyes wide open" is the only one quite atypical, as it seems a music piece of Peter Gabriel, but it isn't a solid attempt to make a true renewal of their sound!! The opener title track is interesting, with its first A Cappella-version and the normal version afterwards, but more electronically oriented than the poliphonic excursions by Yes for example, that I should have appreciated much more (even though of course I can not ask King Crimson for emulating Yes!!)... "Level Five" is interesting, but once again it seems a modern version of "Lark's tongue in aspic" ...to me the real turn of their music direction, is represented by the track "Happy with what you have to be happy with", which was issued 5 months ago as an EP-CD,and it was a true promise!! The sound indeed was fresh and dynamic too, remaining still today the main attraction of the new album "The power to believe, even though of course according to their usual mood!! The track "Dangerous curves" to me doesn't add anything else to the good quality level, in the average of almost the whole last KC's publications, except on the previous "Konstruction of light", which was a bit boring and less well arranged than "Power to believe";"Konstruction..." in fact, in comparison for instance to the splendid "Thrak", was a backward step... naturally in some moments this latter resembled the sound of "Red", in a modern version, but there were fresh music ideas and a great rhytmical section as well, thanks to Bill Bruford and Pat Mastellotto, so that was one of the best KC's issues of the last decade!!But coming back to the present publication, I think of a promising come back, despite of FRIPP&C.; maintaining the typical King Crimson trademark, an infinite "loop" through the decades!!It's not a masterpiece, but is real good!!

Well it should have been a new rock opera, inspired to Genesis &quot;The Lamb lies down on Broadway&quot;; instead the present concept by Spock's Beard unfortunately doesn't stand in the same place !!It lacks of inspiration and sometimes it takes some usual stuff, which sounds like a deja-vous...The 3rd disc contains the previously unreleased material, featuring a diverse ensemble,as a &quot;Yes&quot; coverband,performing the cover of &quot;South side of the sky&quot;, which is quite acid and not useful in my opinion...anyway after this work Neal Morse decided to leave the Spock's, in order to do different live experiences ...such a pity, because if this work his the Spock's Testament of Neal, it's better to follow other prog bands.Recommended only if you can't stand without Spock's Beard.

This is one of the best Soft Machine albums and quite underrated by the critics as well.Every person fond of complex and &quot;brainstorming&quot; music, like the modern experimental works from the French Zeuhl music and the experimental symphonic ones as well(such as Magma, Dun and Minimum Vital) is involved in some stuff which is far from this Soft Machine work, but not very different. &quot;Six&quot; is the roundabout for S.M., then you can choose to continue with their music or change in order to hold the most difficult style of Zeuhl music...However this work is highly recommended and not only as an historical document!!

Well the present recent work by IQ sometimes is in the vein of such Art Rock stuff of the early eighties, resembling the "Crimsonian" sound (talking about the guitars) which is remarkable, but often-in the other circumstances- there's a certain sense of tiredness...in fact the organ sound doesn't captivate me and therefore this is a sort of tribute to their old famous track "the Enemy Smacks"!! Honestly this is not a work in progress,as a matter of fact they are exploring their past here and I'm disappointed!!But never mind, cause their taste is acceptable!! Then I remark the controversial song " Red Dust Shadow ", which makes me fall asleep (as well as it's established for the main character of the story),despite of finding a pretty acoustic guitar within, and an intelligent gentle atmosphere too. Sometimes this style is in the vein of a few songs by Pink Floyd, in the era of "Dark Side Of The Moon", but I don't like the Organ sound very much...in fact once again Martin Orford has chosen to come back to his roots! However I can accept this new controversial emulation, like that following one: "You never will", which is resembling the style of S. Hackett here; and despite of a clock, disturbing me just a bit, it becomes interesting,as long as the track " Next Born Brilliant" partially makes me change idea.By regarding their hammering bass- enriched with a "retro-sound" (Mellotron) and some radio voices as well into the final section, this time I stay listening to them: but this effect reminds me of the same radio effect into "Script for a Jester's" by Marillion, and actually there was a more original "radio pitch adjustment" inside this album in comparison to the invention by IQ: so all these reasons are pushing me to express a more critical opinion, after a repetitive listening!! Finally the last suite, "Harvest Of Souls",which is twenty-five minutes long, and my patience is coming to an end!!. This epic number is not their attempt to "beat" the glory of Supper's Ready by Genesis, but anyway, by means of such 70's instrumentation like the Hammond, the Mellotron and the analogical synths (seldom replaced by the digital modern ones),their music crescendo brings the listener to the pleasant guitar solo... this latter is not performed in the intelligent manner of "Ever", where Holmes looked for some more personal harmonic solutions, but once again it never minds!! Probably "Ever" remains as their most personal and original album of the nineties, talking about their recent production, even though I don't get crazy for this operation, sometimes reducing our progressive genre to the melodic mainstream genre (fortunately in a few circumstances only!!)

Probably this is the best modern production by IQ, without P. Nichols and all his &quot;gabrielesque&quot; early Genesis oriented acts...nevertheless the poppy elements of this album are definitively the main reason of their important agreement with a Mercury distributor and Polygram label as well ... it seemed it was the beginning of a new era for the promotion of their works in the future, instead ...well such problem for instance occurred to the US band Echolyn, when They signed the contract with the label Sony on 1995 and wasted their money, because They didn't sell enough!! As usual the problem was connected with the promotion, in fact the same IQ didn't avail themselves of such advertising, nor obtained anything from the media at their next issue entitled &quot;Are you sitting confortably?&quot;. Apart from all these considerations,this pop album is not bad: first of all the track &quot;No love lost&quot; and also &quot;Common ground&quot;, despite of being a bit mainstream, were well arranged and solid compositions too;naturally these songs have been often played live on stage (the first song was afterwards &quot;recovered&quot; by Nichols during some gigs, while the second one was included into the fine collection entitled &quot;J'Ai Pollette D'Arnu&quot;);besides the title track was another melodic hit and the rest remained in the average of a good pop album, being quite remarkable!!As for the above clarifications,if you like this change of direction, in comparison to their derivative early material, for sure you will appreciate their next album &quot;Are you sitting confortably?&quot; ... otherwise if you get crazy with the 70's mood or the early Genesis derivative sound, you can wait till the next issue by P. Nichols, after his comeback with the good album &quot;Ever&quot; (actually a bit boring in some moments). As usual make your choice ... but naturally if you are not oriented to the less busy moments of modern new-prog, stay far away from this issue!

Well the right score is 3 stars and 1/2, this album remaining their best, even if the rythmical section isn't always inspiring !! There are 2 long tracks only, concerning a conceptual and mythological theme...&quot;Nunca de Noche&quot; concludes the album, this song being the best track of the album, by means also of a strong piano...moreover a lot of excursus at the moog synths and sometimes their romantic imitation of Yes too, keep on maintaining the tension quite high. They certainly pay a tribute, but apart from some discontinuos moments, this lp isn't bad...anyway I prefer these derivative moments than those ones of their second album &quot;Chasing the dragonfly&quot;, by which they try to be more experimental, often failing...

Well honestly this album is inferior than &quot;L'isola di niente&quot; or &quot;Chocolate kings&quot;, but the songs almost stand in the same place. In fact this english version of &quot;Per un amico&quot; is characterized by the weak recording of &quot;River of life&quot; (a stormy intro ELP-like which introduces their &quot;epics&quot; and the melodic chatarsis of the flute as well, to all the fans of classic prog), through the weak expression of the vocalist and also the mellotron saturation, without making us involve in the symphonic breakthrough, like in the best moments of the above mentioned albums...instead I think of the super-classic track &quot;Il banchetto&quot; and also of &quot;Mr 9 till 5&quot;,this latter in the vein of the jazz progressive ensemble Area, as for the complex music armony: this time the weak recording doesn't affect the quality of the compositions, which can be compared to the best ones from &quot;Storia di un minuto&quot; (&quot;Dove e quando&quot;, &quot;E' festa&quot; and &quot;La carrozza di Hans&quot; above all), whose best tracks are considered by many fans like immortal classics naturally, and almost reach the grandeur of &quot;L'isola di niente&quot; and &quot;Chocolate kings&quot;!!Recommended, but first listen to the other pearls by PFM and the former singer of Acqua Fragile,Bernardo Lanzetti, as well.

This is not the best sample of his big range of styles and is also quite heterogonous, as for the presence of live songs and those ones from the studio...but it's so much cheap that it can be the first place to start with such a small but important extract from his unforgettable career...after this one you can buy the other official studio albums,also in the double CD-format!!Not essential, but it's anyway interesting!!

This album is characterized by a more accessible sound,except on a weird song,&quot;Bless Your Lucky Stars&quot;, and it is worth actually 3 stars and 1/2!!In fact the best track - a spacey tune with distort vocals -is &quot;Bless your lucky stars&quot;: it seems a space rock classic stuff, along with &quot;Pigstorm&quot;, a good instrumental,and the good songs &quot;Kite&quot; and &quot;Simple Human Kindness&quot;, in the vein of the best Kevin Ayers' work. In my opinion the departure of Gustavson influenced the songwriting and let Jim Pembroke become the main composer,whose songs instead were not equal to those ones by Kevin Ayers!!Good, but not completely essential work... make your choice!!

Finally a natural effort! (listen to the splendid - but a bit forced and innatural - work of &quot;Harbour of Tears&quot;, in order to understand what I mean)... well honestly not the whole stuff here is much inspiring, because there are a few sad songs, sung by Andy in a tepid manner (unlike his vocal interpretation in &quot;A nod and a wink&quot;, this lp being very brilliant in comparison to his standard), which make this album a bit boring and formulaic in a few moments ... the first track &quot;Three wishes&quot; is splendid, despite of the floydian citation at the beginning, because the prosecution is stunning, by means of a monumental guitar solo and a tasteful interplay with the moog/hammond as well (a true CAMEL TRADEMARK !!). The track &quot;Sahara&quot; and the last one &quot;Lawrence&quot; too, are fine gems, sometimes resembling the style of &quot;Ice&quot; ...the other sad songs aren't so brilliant in comparison to those ones belonging to their classics (e.g. &quot;Echoes&quot;,&quot;Nimrodel&quot;, &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot;, etc.)and being anyway very close to the typical CAMEL's style !!Recommended, even if it's not completely essential ...

Well this was a controversial album as for the presence of a couple of pop hits (tasteful at least anyway), but the rest is more symphonic oriented and it can create a magical atmosphere, sometimes melancholic, but tasteful, above all by means of the fantastic voice and interpretation of Annie Haslam ... besides the TITLE TRACK is one of the finest prog efforts of all time, this jewel being enormous!!! There are also pieces of music art at the piano and touching/sensible stuff too ("Opening out" is a typical example) ...this work stands in the same place and it's almost equal to "Turn of the cards", "Scheherazade" ,"Ashes are burning" (the same consideration I have to do for almost the whole stuff by "Novella")Highly recommended to all the people with good taste !!

Well this was the first lp by Clepsydra I listened to: I wasn't so much impressed by this work,this swiss ensemble being totally derivative and not original too. Yet They tried to make us appreciate their attempt to polish the obsolete sound of 80's new prog, by means of fresh ideas, concerning the technology and the guitar effects too, above all... They didn't succeed in solve this question, but They demonstrated to get it during their performance live:I saw a couple of gigs in Switzerland and I was quite satisfied (afterwards They kept on being better live on stage than in their studio's stuff ...); They became more mature and some prog fanzines put them among the best swiss newprog bands (anyway I prefer the newprog work-&quot;Vision in the dark&quot;-by Deyss,or the dark classic prog band Island, in their small jewel &quot;Pictures&quot;). Since the first track of the album you can remark the work of Clepsydra's guitarist-Lele Hofman, showing his good talent, even if He paid a tribute to his master Steve Hackett; while the keyboardist and the vocalist demonstrated a certain maturity as well and afterwards They grew... (honestly the swiss accent of the vocalist is quite visible, but nevermind).The other tracks are characterized by the same permanent waves, this album being homogeneous till the end !!Recommended only if you are fond of the 80's newprog ...

Well there are some choices here like the flaw and not useful track &quot;Your own special way&quot; or the usual &quot;I know what I like&quot;, which nowadays is not interesting nor believable as hit single !!, that I don't approve(The absence of the splendid Bank's intro of &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;-despite of the fantastic guitar solo- here completed with great solo stuffs by Hackett and the excellent performance by Wetton as well, is another example).But the rest is full with great arrangements and skillful performances as well(&quot;Watcher of the sky&quot; or &quot;Dance on a volcano&quot; are positive examples).A special mention for the fantastic version of &quot;Fountain of Salmacis&quot;, in my opinion the best of all time, so that it makes this album well worth checking out.Higly recommended !!

Perhaps it's the best effort by Ian Anderson so far and in my opinion it's better than all the latter Jethro Tull albums. The production is excellent and should be well worth checking out!!

Well I 've already rated the audio cd version regarding the present live dated 1984, which has been "video remastered" in a remarkable manner... by means of this famous concert gig in London A. Latimer & C. let their melodic prog music play as an accessible stuff for a wider crowd, usually not involved with such a diverse light prog rock genre. However, before this one, I suggest to buy their recent representation live on stage in the USA concerning the "Harbour of Tears" Tour, that's "A Coming of Age": unfortunately this latter is available in the underground music shop only, being suitable for their "aficionados" (not for the fans of the commercial mainstream I mean...). The short frame concerning the concept album "The Snow goose" ("Rhayder" and "Rhayader goes to town") is tasteful, but naturally "La Princesse Perdue" is their true surprise, being one of the bonus tracks along with a few old songs such as "Never Let go" or "Uneven Song" for example, which you couldn't find within the audio cd version (entitled "Pressure Points" live). Moreover I wanna make a special mention for "Hymn To Her", a delightful execution at the guitar for Andy, in the vein of his instrumental best tunes like for instance "Ice" or the recent "The Hour candle", as usual "must-have" tracks during his famous live performances. Instead, talking about their commercial tunes, as I don't like the "Stationary Traveller" album I can't listen to the title track nor to "West Berlin", a couple of pop songs which I don't like very much...nevermind, the present DVD witnesses the best period for Camel (talking about the feedback by European and American people, almost making every album of the eighties a best-seller).Nowadays the future of the band is obscured by dark clouds, but I wanna wish them a long live tour in the next years - and this is my hope at least!!

Their combination of classical music stuff with some &quot;jehtrotullesque&quot; styles and a good songwriting as well, influenced the works of Acqua Fragile (in my opinion this latter was an improvement, even though is almost Yes oriented and sometimes in the vein of Gentle Giant too), then also those ones by Locanda delle Fate,the best from Banco and PFM,etc,which have regarded some Q.V.L. stuff as one of the important 70's prog references (the present work by Q.V.L. is dated 1972).Instead talking about their defects, the melodic and quite tasteful sound of the violin and the piano as well, is replaced in some moments by a rawer style. Naturally They found their definitive music path by means of their 2nd album &quot;Il tempo della gioia&quot;, which is softer but better structured and more refined too !! Anyway make your choice once again !! For me you can buy both, even though such albums are not completely essential ...

Well this album has got the same reputation like their previous one,even though it's more refined!! Naturally the tracks are just a little bit better structured, longer and softer as well...besides some spare references to jazz music, broken up by other songs with classical instrumentation such as harpsichord and good strings, make this album quite worth checking out! Well perhaps it's less accessible than their debut album, nevertheless you find an original symphonic style, enriched with odd instrumentation (of course in comparison to the usual set of prog rock)like the clarinet and saxophone as well ! The good vocal harmonies complete this worth album.Recommended...

This is a simple album, without any peak or other strange music invention;neverthless 8 tracks are well represented by some stunning instrumentals, thanks to a good rythmical section supporting the job of the guitars and the keyboards too, in an excellent crescendo!! There are not amazing solos, magniloquent atmospheres nor great lessons, regarding of the harmonic solutions, but the output is tasteful, by means of the elegant choice of the sounds and a convincing energy in the execution as well !! The jazz background of Alain Chiarazzo has been never dominant,yet it's present here and the result is excellent (I can not make the same considerations, talking about their previous work...). It's a good album, with some important breaks through during the instrumentals, and the support of spare parts at the violin!!One of the best last recent prog issues from France ...

Besides you can find here some unreleased material belonging to this south american -versatile- light symphonic band; and moreover this anthology celebrates the 20 years of activity, where you can listen also to some different arrangements (&quot;Human beins&quot; and &quot;Rapsodia Cigana&quot; are among the best tracks coming from the superb album &quot;Grande Espirito&quot;)Recommended not only to Sagrado's fans!!

This is the most underrated album by BMS;honestly it is worth 4 stars and 1/2, because there's a change of route in their execution, regarding of their new style, which sometimes let us remain a bit perplex!!However despite of lacking the vocals by Di Giacomo, the instrumental excursion (all along its duration)is stunning...it's a sort of mix between the symphonic stuff by Zappa and the jazzy style at the piano by Keith Emerson, in the period of &quot;Brain salad surgery&quot;, by avoiding the excesses of virtuosity!! The compositions at the piano by Vittorio Nocenzi are tasteful as usual and the real orchestrations are perfect and well balanced!!This is my favourite album by Banco, despite of being less ambitious in comparison for example to &quot;Darwin&quot; or &quot;Io sono nato libero&quot;; and the only defect is the absence of Di Giacomo...Highly recommended!!

Well after the issue of this fantastic space and dark album, with a lot of reverberations, great organ lines by Banton (this musician supporting the exceptional performance of Peter HAMMIL together with Jackson's sax, close to some experimental Canterbury),they settled the definitive style togther with Magma, a great reference also for the Neoclassical French school/Zeuhl Music, which found his way after publications like these, by giving an improvement in the following decade as long as a new complex style of PROGRESSIVE MUSIC took shape (Univers Zero, Dun and sometimes After Crying and Minimum Vital in their dark moments as well).Afterwards the experimental prog bands brought something special in the progressive field by means of their fresh ideas.Coming back to this work by V.D.G.G., I like to remark the importance of the incredible final suite &quot;Plague of Lighthouse Keepers...&quot;, which is one of the most original and influential of the last 30 years, this being one of the best prog pages of all time!!Highly recommended, not only for the lovers of dark prog music!!

This is one of the best solo stuff by Peter HAMMIL, that could be easily put among the best albums by Van Der Graaf Generator, the present solo album representing Peter Hammil at his best and in the vein of his prog efforts with Banton, Jackson, Evans&amp;company(together with the mythical &quot;Fall of the house of usher&quot;, in my opinion)...like a new piece of ART-MUSIC, with the support of the former members of V.D.G.G naturally!!. Besides you can find a variety of topics, showing the exceptional versatility of this great artist and fantastic vocalist as well!! The opening track &quot;Modern&quot; is a clear reference, a certain visible recall to the mythological cities of the Ancient times (Babylon, Atlantis, etc), talking about the ephemeral nature of human things, through the filter of Hammil's dark experience and dramatic act too (listen to &quot;Fall of the house of Usher&quot; and understand why...): Peter analyses here the controversial/unsolved question about the sense of life, passing through the bother hood and the critical moments as well.His approach is similar to that one utilised with V.D.G.G., but I think of his more personal work, focused on his life,by means of his typical acoustic guitar/piano work too ...so the support of his long time friends is necessary but marginal, Hammil being the dominant character here!!Recommended also to the fans of V.D.G.G.!!

This was the first time that Steve Hilage looked for a personal music path of his own, quite far away from the style of Gong ... unlike his best album &quot;Fish rising&quot;, very avantgarde and Canterbury oriented, in the vein of early Gong, this album is less connected to such style, being enriched with his own 70's guitar excursions. This Todd Rundgren's production is strong and finally points out the definitive guitar style by Hilage. The track &quot;Electric gypsies&quot; sets the standard for the style of his forthcoming works; instead the last 3 tracks remain quite linked to the Canterbury style of Gong. The best track probably is &quot;Hurdy Gurdy Man&quot;, which tells the story of a strange minstrel, who reminds us of some feelings of Hilage, searching for love (according to the 70's hippie tradition)... in fact this minstrel sings love songs, then the rhythm grows and finally it leads to a aggressive guitar solo !!Well it's not the best canteburian work, but naturally is recommended if you like Gong and other 70's stuff ...

This work contains a lot of classic stuff such as &quot;Proclamation&quot;, &quot;No God's a Man&quot;, &quot;The face&quot;, which are fine and solid tracks, these songs being immortal classics... you find also the typical poli-rythms parts and the multi-vocal section, which make this album a classic among others, and a &quot;GENTLE GIANT TRADEMARK&quot;. Their love for madrigals, mixed sometimes with a baroque sound typical of the keyboard oriented TRIO (more ELP oriented), make almost their works original and memorable (along with &quot;Octopus&quot;, &quot;Free Hand&quot; and the majority of &quot;In a Glass House&quot; too, this latter the most original work!!).But talking about &quot;The power and the glory&quot;, this concept album is very interesting: it tells the story of un unnamed ruler, who in appearance took care of the important values of a nation,including its culture and historical tradition, but when He began to savour the taste of POWER, He started to forget his previous attention to this patriotic sense, by appreciating only his status-quo!! You don't find here the same taste for the experimentations like into &quot;Acquiring the taste&quot;, but naturally it's less boring and more pleasant in comparison to their second work,even though They maintain a certain experimentation with dark mood in the track &quot;Aspiration&quot;, which was also an important reference to V.D.G.G. in the album &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot;!!Highly recommended!!

Well actually the right rate should be 3 and 1/2 as for the presence of some uneven tracks belonging to the final part of their remarkable music career...nevertheless this is a very interesting double CD live, witnessing their good skill and versatility as well, expecially live on stage!! Even though the album &quot;Piktors ...&quot; is a bit sacrificed,the other hits are almost complete and well performed (listen to the amazing suite &quot;Adonis&quot;, their best classic live stuff , always played in the period between 1980 and 1983).. despite of their production being sometimes good and in other moments weaker, this live is essential for their fans. Unfortunately it represents their last remarkable effort live, because afterwards They turn to mainstream and funky music, quite indecent ... Well if you like the &quot;wrapping atmosphere&quot; of their mini-suites and also some derivative stuff , sometimes in a gentle mood, but always in the vein of the symphonic Pink Floyd, for sure you won't be disappointed ... otherwise stay far away from this material if you don't like such style.Make you choice !!

Well to me this work is a bit inferior than &quot;Lex Rex&quot;, from the point of view of its dynamics and variety as well, regarding of the &quot;layout&quot; of the suites and of its quite usual orchestrations too!!But the output is anyway excellent, except on some weak rhythmical parts... the melodies sometimes are in the vein of the works by Tears for Fears, in other circumstances such songs are more similar to the harmonic solutions by the US prog band Echolyn (listen to the chorus section of the 1st track).Therefore the magical and simple interplay between the guitars and the keyboards, enriched by means of an epic atmosphere, makes this album well worth checking out!! Of course I prefer some less prolix parts from &quot;Lex Rex&quot;, but anyway the melodies (sometimes resembling some works by Yes,like &quot;Going for the One&quot;, within track #2) are often interesting, even though a bit tiring during the development of the last suite!!Recommended!!

This time the right rate should be &quot;3 stars and 1/2&quot; (&quot;4 stars&quot; the remastered picture disc-version), but IQ is one of the historical bands of UK 80's newprog, which is still producing good music; and for this reason the impact is so impressive, as long as you fall in love with this album. It's a classic for all seasons, whose remastering, though, is much better, permitting you to know some particular aspects, in comparison to the original recording(for istance the &quot;waterfall&quot; of synth's sounds at a low frequence). &quot;Outer limits&quot;, the 1st track, is a dramatic one, focused on the work of Martin Orford at the keyboards and on the solid interpretation of Nichols as well, this time being involved in the research of a more personal direction, concerning his voice, instead of emulating P. Gabriel ... while the title track isn't so much interesting in my opinion, this song being a bit formulaic! After a magical intro at the keyboards and the following master crescendo of &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot; (honestly it culminates into a soft and quite tepid vocal interpretation, afterwards growing-anyway- in dynamics, with a dramatic vocal tone...), you find a forgettable hit single &quot;Corner&quot;, which is an electronic loop, almost an interlude before the best track of the album,the epic and aggressive &quot;Widow's speak&quot;, whose crescendo is fantastic !!At last I have to make another couple of citations:1) The strange song &quot;Headlong&quot;, culminating in a captivating rhytmical pattern (the asynchronies with the keyboards are very original)and ...2) The track &quot;Dans Le parc du chateau noir&quot;, which instead is more 70's oriented and once again characterized by a stunning, dramatic guitar solo by Mike Holmes (another underrated guitarist)...well I would like to ask the band for replacing the demo version of &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot;, with one mini-suite, more consistent and amazing,the mythical &quot;It all stops here&quot;, but nevermind this album is right well in this manner!!If you forget a couple of inconsistent pop songs only, the rest is well worth checking out (however better things had to come!!)The digitally remastered version of this lp-as a picture disc- is more recommended, expecially if you like to hear the best of 80's UK newprog, that usually I don't like very much)

Well they are usually labeled like a weird art rock band, that is more similar to a modern &quot;rebelled&quot; and uncoventional band, almost &quot;punk&quot; in their proposal and often with the same proposal by experimental artists like Henry Cow, in comparison to a classic prog band... nevertheless you find also clear references to the classic mexican romantic prog genre in this album, such as ICONOCLASTA, from the modern side of their style (in the vein of &quot;The lamb&quot; by Genesis ),even though the approach is much more raw and sloppy.Moonsongs&quot; and &quot;Possessed&quot; are the best tracks, by means also of 2 different female singers,but their Gentle Giant oriented tracks-in an acid version of their own- are difficult to take (listen also to their new album &quot;In extremis&quot;...)You like or you hate them, make your choice !!

Well, by following the whole career by John, you can understand such an uneven music artistic inspiration, above all if you regard of his progressive period with King Crimson and UK for instance; and then listening to his solo albums of the late nineties (note: partially in the recent years as well), you accept the way John chose the commercial music, anyway. Nevertheless the present live production can be "labelled" among the different alternative genres, as for his recent attempt in exploring new music territories, even though quite melodic and anyway listenable, if you regard the likings of the common people...but coming back to the present live, I like to remark the importance of such prog tunes like "In the Dead of Night" by UK, here in a good version and quite listenable for the common listener; then "The Night Watch", a crimson classic that is losing something here, above all by comparing it to the original and the immortal "Starless", whose "incipit" is always melancholic and the development of the plot fine too!! Then I appreciate a sweet ballad like "Emma" and the good arrangement regarding "The Last Thing On My Mind" after the guitar intro of the opener, which is characterized by the typical mood of the most dramatic tones of a few solo albums by John!"Rendez-Vous 6:02 " instead is lacking the famous solo at the analogic synth (CS80) by Eddie Jobson, cause here it looks like a normal ballad; besides another famous and a bit sad tune entitled "Book of Saturday" ("Crimson" Era) doesn't add anything to the original , but it is an intelligent contribution to this mix between the old stuff and that interesting recent one (except on a few exceptions, like for instance "Suzanne", a bit tepid...).Not the best live by John, but it's quite worth checking out at least!

Well this album could be a classic fusion stuff from the USA in the future, even though their debut album was more progressive oriented ...anyway They have been able to make a remarkable tribute to King Crimson (&quot;Red&quot; era), by means of a stunning version of the title track from the &quot;mythical&quot; album with Bruford and Wetton...so it's clear that their fusion stuff sometimes steers towards the 70's classic prog, expecially regarding the clever use of the Hammond organ by John Novello and the excellent creative bass guitar as well, by Billy Sheehan ...well this issue is perhaps the best effort so far, along with &quot;High Bias&quot;, and it seems it fits into such fusion prog perfectly, being suitable for live executions with improvisational stuff!!Recommended fusion prog, even though is not equal for instance to &quot;Romantic Warrior&quot; by Return to Forever...nevermind Niacin could produce some clever and excellent music-like that one by RTF- in the future!!

Well what's all the fuss about it? Ok it's not a prog album, but rather better labelled as AOR music or mainstream, sometimes in the vein of B. Adams. The unique exception could have been represented by the track#9 "Loyal" or a few melodic moments, but the singer is not able to emulate this kind of "Gabrielesque" vocalism; or you could have also appreciated a different style, emulating the modern Yes band of the "Modern Rabin Era" within the first two tracks, but then you can stay listening to it and you are disappointed at the end...the good intoduction inside "Waterhole" is not enough to recommend the present album, as the role of G. Downes at the keyboards is not remarkable here and the approach by the veteran drummer A. White is not equal to his performance with the old Yes!!So I'm not enthusiastic about it, but make your own choice as usual!

Well this work is a brave attempt to polish the old sound of italian classic prog, by adding a fresh and modern reworking of their own (apart from a very few common places, regarding of 80's UK New-Prog, expecially in the Marillionesque track no 4). The album is quite short (46 minutes), nevertheless it's characterized by a lot of music ideas ... &quot;Canto #1&quot; is the 26 minutes-suite, as a sort of historical reference to a famous letter written by a friend from 1400, which was sent to the duke of Urbino, Federico de Montefeltro: its music narration is &quot;filtered&quot; through an excellent orchestration and the lyrics by the italian singer Virgilio as well, whose operatic falsetto is well performed !!The shortest song &quot;Cielo di carta&quot; is characterized by an airy piano and an etheral acoustic guitar too, which is always tasteful. Well talking about its main defect, the present album pays a certain tribute to bands such as PFM and Errata Corrige, by alternating folk moments to classic symphonic breaks through, which seem a bit forced ... but apart from this consideration, usually They are not a derivative band; moreover their album, produced by a French label MUSEA Record, is quite well varied and also for this reason well worth checking out !!

There are some interesting symphonic breaks through, with an interesting flow of melodies and a pretty instrumental interplay between the keyboards and the guitar (Arcansiel-like or in the vein of bands such as Nuova Era, Galadriel and so on)...this work is better than the insipid 1st album,by means of conceptual pieces, sometimes influenced by early Marillion. The vocals have improved a lot, in comparison to their debut, even if They are inferior than other italian prog bands such as Aufklarung or Sacka, from the point of view of their creativity and composition as well ...quite recommended if you like the bands I have mentioned above

Sorry for the low rate, but if you regard this tepid work as an experimental swedish prog band, you have to forget the grandeur of another excellent scandinavian band, Anglagard. The present album by Landberk tries to emulate the chromaticity and the accuracy as well, concerning the sound research typical of bands such as CATHEDRAL US 70'(this one actually being a bit more experimental and dark as well), but the output is not far away from some stuff of the early eighties new-wave, or 70's pop with a few prog colors at least (a dark version of Fantasy's &quot;Paint a Picture&quot; )...probably the lyrics should have been stylistically improved some years later only, in comparison to the present reviewed album, in the album &quot;Indian Summer&quot;. The music score of &quot;One man tell's another&quot; is simple, even if the band maintains a dramatic sense during their music &quot;narration&quot;, by means also of 70's instrumentation such as mellotron and so on...If you love 70's pop with prog colors, in the manner of the band &quot;Fantasy&quot; and the 90's &quot;Men of lake&quot;, by adding a certain dark mood, you can appreciate this album, otherwise stay far away from this work!!

Well this album is absolutely underrated and often unknown as well...it is worth &quot;4 stars and an half&quot; at least. That is it's partially an unplugged tasteful album with a Medieval mood, which is absolutely inspiring,but also with symphonic breaks through,making this album well worth checking out!!Besides this is another hidden gem, which seems perfect to be performed in a theater (along with &quot;Contrappunti&quot;)...even though &quot;Contrappunti&quot;, unlike this &quot;Florian&quot;, is closer to some albums by ELP and completely different. In fact this is a strange album in comparison to their standard; but otherwise another underrated work -&quot;Di Terra&quot;- by &quot;Banco del Mutuo Soccorso&quot; was different in comparison to their usual mood, an imprinting by Di Giacomo&amp;C., and some critics regarded this issue as a failed attempt to innovate their style...the same destiny which coupled Banco to Le Orme.Recommended!

Well you know that my opinion has been never affected by my symphonic music background and as such an interesting live - like this recent one - brought about a certain emotional feeling among all the fans of the band, including me, I 'm happy to review this product after burning it at my DVD player one more time. In fact We have been waiting for this important performance - as it is witnessed by their second most inspiring and best DVD (after "Lex Live") - for a couple of years and right now I can say it's really worth the price.Of course - even though the mood is not equal for instance to that incomparable transmitted by another symphonic band like After Crying (think of a couple of recent famous lives, regarding this latter fantastic amd more versatile Hungarian band), I think that the approach of G.H. is well worth checking out at least. But coming back to their tunes, I like to mention the stunning instrumental opener of "Long and Long Ago", where David Walliman - their newcomer guitarist - shows his good skill, even when He plays a few " more jazzy" harmonic lines taken directly from Disc Two of "The Inconsolable Secret" studio album; then I appreciate "One King" very much, a selection from "Lex Live", which is better than the original version. Moreover here Carl Groves is well fitted into the new ensemble of G.H., like otherwise in the track "Through the Glass Darkly", where He supportes Susie - the lead vocalist - in a remarkable way!!Instead the epic number "Knight of the North" is worth a special mention, because the long instrumental interludes work in a cool way, above all thanks to the team work, regarding of all the core members and the instrumental unplugged lines by Eric Parker as well...the quality of the mix is good in general, making this "Live At Belmont" a must- have for the fans of this intelligent US band.

Well apart from their attempt to make the italian people remind of the Gentle Giant style (they have &quot;stolen&quot; the refrain-chorus from G.G. in the track &quot;Comix strips&quot;),they have made an important imprinting of their own, without forgetting anyway the &quot;Yes-oriented&quot; ballads(listen to &quot;Science Fiction suite&quot;,which was inspired by &quot;I've seen all good people&quot; from &quot;YESALBUM&quot; and also &quot;Wonderous stories&quot; from &quot;GOING FOR THE ONE&quot;);but here Bernardo Lanzetti takes a lot from his personal experience too ...that is the style that He brought to PFM in the remarkable album &quot;Chocolate Kings&quot;, as for his clear romantic taste, typical of that period (1976),helped by a delicious sound and enriched with a &quot;waterfall&quot; of mellotron as well. The &quot;ACQUA FRAGILE TRADEMARK&quot; is more visible in the excellent &quot;Song from a picture&quot;, even if the sound is quite Yes-like and under the influence of PFM too (in the track &quot;Going out&quot; they are influenced by Yes once again, but without stolen any kind of stuff!!)... The final track &quot;Three hands man&quot; is their best and more personal too, in my opinion, (after 5 minutes and an half you find the splendid atmosphere similar to that one coming from the markets of Naple-Italy, which grows in dynamics more and more,by culminating into the organ solo- a certain mood as &quot;tarantella&quot; and the piano crescendo as well(such crescendo reminds us of Tony Banks by Genesis), as long as Lanzetti leads the remarkable ensemble to the end. Their chorus, Yes-like, is the right style for this song and it works well, making this album well worth checking out!!Recommended to all the people with taste!!

Well this is the best live so far since the issue of "LIVE RECORD"...in this "Coming of age" you can find the whole best stuff from "The snow Goose", "Nude", "Dust and dreams" and moreover I want to remark the great pathos and beautiful execution as well by Andy, in the great tracks "Lunar Sea", Hymn to her", "Ice", "Beached" and also in the final track "The hour candle" dedicated to his father, this page being one of the most sensible and finest of the whole Camel career...Highly recommended!!

Well this is a very interesting and original work of the early seventies ('75), still resembling the sound of proto-prog bands such as Cressida and Gracious, nevertheless this album - being characterized also by the strong mellotron parts- makes the sound romantic and quite original (Woolly Wolstenholme, keyboardist for BJH, will make his important contribution to their 2nd effort...yet in my opinion such ensemble is a bit less pop and more interesting than BJH) . The idea which drives this album, based upon the project by David Rohl, author of a TRILOGY inspired by Tolkien, is a sort of musical with unusual melodic hooks for those times and also tasteful orchestral interludes(listen to their following album &quot;The eye of Wendor&quot;,regarding a tolkeniesque world within a trilogy,dated 1978).But talking about this debut album, the whole material, written by Rohl, is well represented by the 20-minute piece -divided into four movements-entitled &quot;Om Mani Padme Um&quot;, the most symphonic track, with beautiful choirs and expressive guitar lines at the end,even though quite simple.After all the album works very well in this suite;however the other more typical 70's songs: &quot;Roof of the world&quot; and &quot;Song for a king&quot;, are memorable pieces of sensible music, sometimes a bit formulaic, but always intense and powerful.Recommended as a proto-prog version of The Enid!!

This lp, along with &quot;The jewel&quot;, is well worth checking out if you appreciate the light symphonic style &quot;Camel-oriented&quot;, and I have given &quot;3 stars&quot; only to this work as for some ingenousness ... but apart from the usual ordinary references to the romantic classicprog (this main genre being another thing!!), the album by Pendragon is worth &quot;4 STARS&quot;, because They tried to polish the UK new prog sound, even their derivative style, though, remains their trademark,making this album stand in the right place among the 90's UK best newprog bands (honestly a very few ones).Certainly We forgive them for resembling the latter style of Pink Floyd in the melodies (just a little bit).The title track, apart from the vocal style, is a bit formulaic and mellow, this being quite interesting anyway(I lough when I think of their emulation in the INTRO, concerning the original lyrical piece from a famous italian musician...in a bad italian language naturally, but nevermind ): instead &quot;Guardian of my soul&quot; , &quot;Master of illusions&quot; and sometimes &quot;As good as gold&quot; are worth songs !Unfortunately after this album They began to resemble the new prog classic style too much (listen to &quot;Not of this world&quot; and understand the reason why...), Pendragon becoming quite uneven and keeping on duplicating their usual derivative style too much often!!Recommended if you like the best moments - a few- of 90's UK new progressive wave ...

Ok, usually I'm not a big fan of the so-called "Progressive Metal", even though sometimes I can appreciate a few live gigs, like the present one, anyway witnessing the activity of this Polish Band from Warsewz in a special way!!When the work "Anno Domini High Definition" from Studio was issued, simultaneously Riverside recorded this live in the course of 2008, then post produced at Toya Studios in the following year...two band members came from the world of prog metal, but actually the other members were so involved with a different genre, similar to an aggressive progressive rock, tinged with dark tones, which brought about a diverse mood around their exhibitions on stage!They remind me of a kind of Modern and dark psychedelic prog, resembling the sound of the recent Porcupine Tree for example, regardless of the ipnotic opener entitled "The same river", whose atmoshere is enriched by means of an interesing guitar, almost "oneiric" in its melodic lines. Unfortunately some other songs like "Rainbow box" or "Out of myself" are not convincing, above all for their lacking creativity, as well as the vocal interpretation, which seems to emulate J. La Brie from Dream Theater in a forced manner...even though the following suite is not bad, especially the interplay guitar/organ within a "non-linear" pattern of "Volte-Face", here reminding me of Dream Theater once again. Instead "Reality dream #3" is characterized by some soft breaks-through alternating a few immediate technical solos, without a common thread.The visualization and the scenographic aspects of the band, a bit static on stage, represent the second defect of this band, despite of the 16 minutes suite "Second Life Syndrome" ,which is their classic powerful number...ok, but is it enough to regard their music an innovative example of art, especially nowadays?Anyway a good and essential live work only within a collection of dark prog metal, certainly influenced by a kind of soft progressive rock!! So make your own choice as usual!!

An unforgettable and underrated follow-up to "Di terra" (this latter an experimental and more progressive album, but nevermind...), whose peculiarity is the simple but impressive approach of their arrangements, but also a kind of accessible poetry inside their lyrics, which make the present album well worth checking out at least!!You won't find any long suites here (a-la "Darwin", I mean) and you can get an inkling of their modern style (more mainstream and popular) that in this case does not disturb us, as purists of prog music...their epic style is expressed by means of some shorter songs and the album is quite sophisticated anyway, regardless the splendid vocal approach by F. Di Giacomo!!The compositions are various, according to different moods, going from the prog counterparts, to the melodic unplugged songs in the soft "Canterburian" style and still passing through the atmospheric tunes, which is a typical "trademark" of the band.The reissue by Virgin is good- above all talking about the quality production- and after all (as an easier album) can complete your collection regarding one of the most important Italian Prog Bands ever!!

Well add another half star at least, especially if you're a long date fan - cause despite of being aligned to the last VDGG album entitled "The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome - you can find some remarkable introspective and sad songs inside the present work dated 1977. Think for example of the emotional tunes like "Looking Glass" or "Betrayed", this latter enriched by means of a great vocal performance by Peter or of other interesting tracks such as the desperate "On Tuesdays..." and once again the progressive oriented tune entitled "Lost And Found" (Peter never forget his roots!!).Of course I prefer the music of Hammil with VDGG, like for instance within the excellent "Pawn Hearts", but the songs mentioned above are anyway respectable. Instead "Autumn" is easier but in the mood of the next solo albums by Peter, characterized by his piano and the violin as well, a kind of ballad ...then you can listen to "Yoga" with its "simil-crimson" structure (a sort of art rock style), which is not bad as well as the plot of the whole album, in general regarding life with its dramatic vicissitudes.Besides the bonus tracks - as an extract from a John Peel radio show - are not so useful neither better than their original studio version, but however the output is remarkable and the songs well structured anyway.Make your own choice, but if you're a long date fan you can't miss it!

He's one of the best guitarists of all time, considering the progressive scene and not only ... &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot; is his TRADEMARK, this track being one of his best tracks ever and almost equal (talking about ITS IMPACT) to his guitar solo in &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot; as well, rightly to mention something famous among his several gems !! Nevertheless you find something special also in the AOR songs like &quot;Everyday&quot;, another classic during his performances live on stage ...instead &quot;Lost time in Cordoba&quot; is another underrated song, this being quite original !!Highly recommended!! (Above all if you are a Genesis fan, considering their last progressive epoque,during the issue of &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot;)

Well it's inferior than the best of Zappa's stuff and that one of Isildur's Bane today as well, but it's the most influential of all the light/experimental Canterburian works...it maintains a great sense of measure, without the excess of certain experimental fusion French prog (in the vein of Art Zoyd or the experimental Magma or Dun for example); besides it has got an high reputation in the jazz canterburian circle of Canterbury (e.g. Matching Mole, Egg and National Health)and it is like &quot;In the court of the Crimson king&quot; by King Crimson as a prog fan's reference for the settlement of the first prog standard.&quot;Mumps&quot; and &quot;Didn't matter anyway&quot; are classic gems by Dave Stewart, with a great keyboard work as well.Highly Recommended to the fan of the intelligent Canterbury (much better than the whole Caravan's stuff!!)

Well this work is more complete and versatile as well, even if less structured, than &quot;Rotter's Club&quot;, which remains a better standard reference in order to understand all the elements of this genre.Dave Stewart by Egg performs a major keyboards' work than that one in &quot;Rotter's Club&quot; (apart from the track &quot;Mumps&quot; from the latter, which is perhaps better,expecially for its versatility).Honestly the music harmony in Rotter's Club seems less complex but with a major structure of the tracks,thinking anyway of a better output here in this great debut,because the experimentation works very well and a bit better.Well, expecially when there is a contamination with symphonic music, everything seems working better.Despite of the different opinion, I recommend both of them and their value is the same (5 stars)

Well this anthology includes almost the best stuff, expecially talking about the album &quot;Floating World&quot;, here entirely represented: such album represents their change of direction, their turn of career,determined also by the enter of Duihig's brother on guitar. Despite of the presence of pleasant melodies and atmospheres, in between there are surprising powerfull riffs, such as those ones within the track &quot;Monkey Chant&quot; or Red Lotus&quot;. The song &quot;Memories of a distant sea&quot; is fine, as its melody is captivating; while &quot;Rainflower&quot; and &quot;Easty&quot; are a Duhig brothers'trademark once more, with a shining personal style and their distinctive guitar sound as well ... it's not a masterpiece, but you find memorable songs and a captivating style too, such as that one regarding tracks like &quot;Songs of the forest or &quot;Arrival of the Emperor...&quot;.A simple but stunning representation of their essential captivating style: it's also very original!!

In this album you find the exceptional drums by Furio Chirico but also an excellent guitar and bass work, well supported by the keyboards... of course it's a 70's &quot;ante-litteram&quot; fusion prog, by means also of Soprano Sax and Violin, which create a well balanced compromise between the complex harmonies in the vein of Gentle Giant and the softer melodic lines more PFM oriented... these could be the right references,nevertheless They are not a derivative band and, on the opposite, their original style has been influencing a lot of jazz prog stuff for a long time in Italy !! Moreover their ante litteram fusion style sometimes reminds me of Weather Report, but -unlike W.R.and often Mahavishnu Orchestra-A.&amp;M. have a symphonic edge of their own !!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND BETTER THAN &quot;GIRO DI VALZER ...&quot;

Well I can not give the maximum rate, despite of the splendid concert for percussion and orchestra, plus - at the end of the 2nd disc - a very pretty session with Buddy Rich as well, because unfortunately this anthology contains some commercial material you can skip: besides the old recordings are very weak (They are not remastered) and moreover the presence of some classic tracks by Asia isn't useful here. But finally this historical document gives the perfect idea of the character Carl Palmer, as a musician (one of the finest british drummers and percussionists off all time),but also the description of Carl as a common man, with a great sense of humour (listen to his splendid performance with B. Rich). As for these reasons this double CD, apart from a few stupid tracks, is recommended (not for the ELP Fans only)

Well apart from the clear reference to Mahavishnu orchestra and Arti&amp;Mestieri in the track &quot;Crossfire&quot;,there are also a lot of interesting symphonic interjections, which make this album more remarkable than for example the Outer Limits debut (even though this latter is quite stunning and rated as a 4 stars work)...the right rate of &quot;Story of mysterious Forest&quot; is probably 4 and 1/2.I make this comparison with the best from Outer Limits, cause many critics, by reviewing some 80's jap. prog, have put these bands on the same level (I prefer Teru's Symphonia &quot;Fable of the Seven Pillows&quot;, a bit better than both...and consider Ain Soph as well superior than Outer Limits, but nevermind). Anyway for me the present work by Ain Soph is already a classic...I find a lot of music styles similar to the best Camel;besides a lot of interesting jamming guitar solos and some post canterburian excursions as well - according the best tradition of bands such as Mational Health and Soft Machine - let appreciate their versatility!! Well I stop reviewing here, because I don't want to affect your opinion.Try to listen to them and make your choice ...

An extraordinary box set witnessing such a great season of progressive rock for Echolyn, in the vein of Gentle Giant and Yes at the beginning (but according to a fusion style of their own), passing through so many changes and different styles as well, finally completely modern and "diverse" in the following steps of their brilliant career...so all these features are contained within the present box, event though probably the Genesis cover of "When The Sweet Turns Sour" is not essential here, but nevermind!! The origin of the songs is well explained inside the booklet and the commentary by Ray Winston is very interesting after all! As a matter of fact the production is always good and the sound clear as well; then you can find also the rare material and three different versions concerning their live stuff recorded in the Studio at the time of "Cowboy Poems Free", which is not bad, despite my choices, which turn soon to "Suffocating the Bloom" and "As the world". Of course my first approach with this important band was in the nineties, but for me this US ensemble has been always exceptional during their important career and sometimes the music suspenseful too. So, even though not all the songs included here are completely essential, I think that it could be a good place for a new listener to start discovering (or rediscovering, in the role of an old fan) the most interesting and exciting progressive music in the USA, since the issue of Myrthrandir's "For you the old women" (regardless, even though in a different style, a few unforgettable US albums like for instance "Leftoverture" by Kansas, just to mention only one essential work...!!).Choose Echolyn anyway!!

This &quot;progressive blues&quot; - in the vein of Colosseum - is an important step closer to the 70's classic prog style and actually is equal to a 3 stars and 1/2 rate ... a bit late, regarding of its issue (1971),nevertheless the utilisation of an acoustic piano and a particular guitar mood as well,sometimes Zeppelinesque, in other moments closer to the canterburian sound of guitarists such as Dave Stewart by Khan or Steve Hilage by Gong, make this album quite memorable. Well It's characterized by the same spirit, even though honestly the sound is completely different. In fact there are not any particular experimentations, as They had not the purpose to be canterburian, but the songwriting was inspiring, despite of being not so insightful. Nevermind, the output is good and this l.p. could be put inside the collection of the most interesting and less busy proto-prog works !! Moreover you can find cool organ riffs and a good range of odd instruments such as vibraphones, flutes, sax and so on.Some songs are lenghty and complex, being influenced also by some jazz stuff.As its sound and arrangement are typical of the transition period between the 60's and the 70's, within the proto-prog field, this album is not a masterpiece,but it is worth checking out!!

Well honestly this re-issue is a disappointing version (remastered CD format) of the original vynil, characterized by an horn-driven jazz with orchestrations ...Mike Westbrook, pianist, composer and arranger too, performed such an interesting suite in the late 60's,divided into 9 parts,with a full array of sax-solos,balanced clever riffs and a fine piano as well(so much atmospheric in the last part),completed by means of several horns excursions too. Such instruments,played with great intensity and energy and, moreover, a remarkable final trumpet solo, represent the catharsis of the whole soundtrack, thanks to the already mentioned -sweet and pleasant- piano,which creates a relax mood!! The problem is connected with the low-mixing of the remaster, which doesn't let us appreciate such intensity or also the beautiful mood of the original opera...The RCA vynil version is recommended,instead the present remastered CD is not equal to the original Neon l.p., unfortunately ...

This masterwork by Camel,whose original import version I own ,is characterized by a very brilliant sound !! The loud mix of the drums and the high mixing of the keyboards/orchestration, unlike the opinion of one reviewer, are a great idea to me, because this album sounds completely diverse in comparison to their previous works!! This album, starting as a bit tepid pop rock, afterwards grows more and more, expecially in the instrumental parts, touching your heart deeply !! ("Cotton Camps", "Broken banks" until the monumental tracks "Hopeless anger" and "Whispers in the rain" make their triumphant entering, are only a few examples). This is an exceptional concept album- based upon the story of "The grapes of wrath" by Steimback- concerning the feelings and drama which stroke the californian families , in the period following the Wall street crash and the big crisis, which affected the life of these poor people!! The guitar of Andy LATIMER is fantastic here!!There are a lot of colors, growing in dynamics and sometimes giving the imprinting of a certain virtuosity (without bombastic and excessive solos anyway!!)...finally a masterpiece, since the issue of "Mirage" and "Snow goose", which is suitable for all the lovers of romantic light symphonic music (moreover another excellent issue, dated 1997,"Harbour of tears", takes a lot of inspiration from "Dust and dreams")Highly recommended!!

Of course &quot;White rider&quot; is the mini-suite They have chosen from &quot;Mirage&quot;, but I should have appreciated the presence of the other classics from that album, much more ... nevermind, because the last gem is alone worth buying!! The sound production is very good,if you consider the year of its issue,1972 ... besides the track &quot;Six ate&quot;, from their debut album, is faithful to the original and quite progressive too, as they chose this one in the place of the other classic &quot;Never let go&quot; .. Anyway, if you are a Camel fan,you have to check this live !!

An excellent and underrated album from the eighties, this album being one of the first AOR/new age oriented works , by Latimer... Well there are 3 symphonic tracks here, as from Docks, Beached,until you find the more new-age oriented Landscape; and these ones are followed by interesting ethnical sounds till the end. Latimer is able to change moods and styles, by adding also something new and diverse in every album (apart from some stuff , such as that one-too much light- into "I can see your house...", "Stationary Traveller";something mainstream into "Breathless" as well and into the disappointing "The single factor"). But talking about "Nude", I regard this album as one of the most interesting by Camel. It is based upon the story of a soldier who was forgotten in a far away isle of the Pacific ocean, near Japan, during the 2nd world war. Many years after the end of the war, nobody went to such atoll and find him, in order to tell him that He could come back home...when the japanese Government sent some public servants in the recent times (in the sixties), they found him without cloths and for this reason his nickname became "NUDE".Nevertheless He was not concerned about the possibility of living the rest of his life over there!!The only inconsistent track is the first one,"City Life", but if you listen to the whole stuff by Latimer,during his long career, you understand that every album contains one uneven/sloppy track at least and one/a couple of jewels as well (sometimes many more)!!Recommended!! Of course it's not the 1st place to start ...

This new prog CD of the eighties is not bad, despite of this album being a bit weak in some parts! Nevertheless the vocal is interesting, reminding me of that one concerning the lead singer of Pavlov's Dog,expecially in the growing section of the title track ...anyway proceeding by order, at the beginning We can listen to a light romantic song,which seems tepid and weak, instead afterwards (in the 2nd section), it grows in dynamics,till you find an epic part almost Yes-like!! Then there are some interesting short spare interplays between the keyboards and the guitars, in order to accompany the melodies in an aggressive manner!! By prosecuting you find funny moments and catchy melodies, even though without any peak, then at last there is a better structured song, &quot;Journey to the east&quot;, which is much representative of this album. In fact it sets their standard to a definitive pop progressive range of music ideas, which could be the best way to hear AOR music enriched with a &quot;full-bodied&quot; sound, typical of such stuff from the early Yes... this album at the end is suitable for the lightest and less busy moments...Recommended as an underrated and interesting new prog/pop progressive album of the 80's UK scene, even though not completely essential.

Well the track &quot;The myth of white Jesus&quot; resumes all the best melodic music ideas within this interesting album!! Moreover some clever guitar solos, without such excesses typical of those guitar driven modern art rock bands, make this album quite original and remarkable as well ... anyway here you find some spare crimsonesque and floydian references, a few ones, but also such a Djam Karet trademark, characterized by a special atmosphere,sometimes ambient-like, but never boring!! Besides a top-notch sound palette and their skill to perform some improvisational stuff too, complete the whole array of their modern music ideas. The powerful rhytmical section, sometimes reminding of that one by Don Caballero (in a less talented manner or without a particular virtuosity),is the right stuff...nevertheless such rhytmical parts are always balanced!! However I think of the opener track and the already mentioned &quot;The myth of white Jesus&quot; as the best examples of their creativity!!Recommended art rock stuff, probably the best one by Djam Karet

Well probably I could add another star in the evaluation, regarding of a remarkable jazz/rock fusion album and for sure if I don't consider the present work like "a progressive rock album" (despite of the guest star S. Howe from Yes being here, playing within a track), this is one of their best performances; nevertheless as it's the last D.Drags album before their breakup dated 1982, it's an important document! Alex Ligertwood from the Santana group and above all Mark O'Connor at the violin (along with Steve Morse in his versatility) all together give an extraordinary contribution to the composition. Naturally it's not equal to "What if" for example or the most famous work entitled "Dregs of the earth", but especially the first half is very energic and creative as well!! It could complete your private collection of fusion rock, even though I prefer some other compositions such as those ones within a few immortal albums like "Romantic Warrior" by Return to Forever or the best contaminations between fusion and prog, where Echolyn meets Brand X...Make your own choice!!

Well After Crying is a fantastic, very versatile ensemble, because in every new album you can discover something special and absolutely interesting!! &quot;De profundis&quot; which begins with a &quot;Gregorian mood&quot;, continues to explore the great possibilities of the synthesizers and introduces the listener to an incredible atmosphere, rich with a lot of colours and a dynamic sounds as well, both dark and &quot;airy&quot; (the track &quot;Stalker&quot; is a typical example).You can listen also to a couple of piano performances, in the vein of Keith Emerson, very well played and a very strong execution in the epic Manok Tanca as well; the rest is represented by some splendid mini-suites. It's true, the vocals are a bit difficult to take, but nevermind, the excellent suites they keep on playing skillfully are an universal language (I suggest another splendid album, the fifth by A triggering Myth, to all the After Crying fans: &quot;Forgiving Eden&quot; is the title, performed with a breathtaking 43 minutes-suite!)I wish you a good listen

Regarding another interesting prog band from Hungary like Solaris, I can say that They were very close to excellence and sometimes even going beyond their personal limits, but never up to After Crying for instance, these latter hungarian group being much more versatile in comparison to Solaris...don't get me wrong, the musicians which composed the present suite were a quite remarkable ensemble, creative enough (especially during their long instrumental numbers), but probably lacking of that quality leap, that could have been led them to other music territories. I mean, They are not able to revisit the symphonic music of the 20th century for example (from Zappa to Gershwin and Ravel) unlike After Crying nor trying to look for new music solutions...anyway their use of the analogical and vintage instrumentation (synthesizers such as the Proteus emulator) is not bad, even though They forget the piano, the Hammond and mellotron. Nevertheless the interplay between guitar and keyboard is not enough in my opinion and not completely convincing...their music is a typical progressive rock with a few hints of New AGE music, but when they play an easy song such as "The Moment Of Truth", I think of the light moments within the Canterburian scene or also of Camel; instead the extraordinary music passages inside the long suites with a 70's feeling (do you remember "Hybris" by Anglagaard or once again "Fold Es Eg" by After Crying?) are not the main features of "Book of Prophecies". Nevermind, cause the album is quite remarkable after all, and at the end you could evaluate the present work a 4 stars' light symphonic prog work", between the best Hungarian top prog albums...Not bad and sometimes essential too!

Well apart from the idea of the keyboardist to emulate Emerson,&quot;Rondo&quot; is a very faithful and honest recreation of the famous piece by Nice !! Instead &quot;Manticore&quot; is the combination of the &quot;Emerson bombastic style&quot; with the vocal airy melody, this one being anyway pleasant; nevertheless &quot;Lelt&agrave;r&quot; features a Gregorian Mood, which is the most interesting and less derivative part of the album !! Besides the solemn atmosphere created by the trumpet in the track &quot;Puer natus in Bethlehem&quot;, is another typical A.C. trademark ...finally the closing section of the 13 minutes &quot;K&egrave;tezer &egrave;v&quot;, which grows in dynamics and intensity as well, as long as they almost reach the perfection!!Recommended !!

Well the right rate would be 4 stars as for a little bit discontinuity, but in this case I like to deserve the maximum rate for the incredible talent of the musicians, expecially in the final suite, rich with a lot of colours, full dynamic scales and other &quot;surprises&quot; as well!! I think of two masterpieces of symphonic music by A.C., like &quot;Megalozottak Es&quot; and &quot;De profundis&quot;, which are almost perfect and a little bit better than this &quot;6&quot;: but the feedback from the A.C. fans to this latter one has been growing in the last years, because the execution on stage of the &quot;Struggle for life&quot; suite has been so amazing to make the fans get more and more enthusiasm. The rest of the album is full of incredible variations in the vein of Frank Zappa and a Tribute to Keith Emerson as well,which remind us of the &quot;Pirates suite&quot; by ELP...anyway the suite by the hungarian band is fresh, original, maintaining the quality very high (listen for example to the incredible musical break in the vein of Stravinsky after the conclusion of the tribute).I hope that A.C. will keep the prog flag flying in the next years

Well it's always difficult for me to give my opinion about collections like this one,because usually the band is in the habit of looking for unusual or very old radio/demo sessions, which aren't always useful at all!! Anyway the sound here is so much clear and brilliant, and the choice of the keyboard sounds are as usual suitable for the modern new-prog,this latter being not pretentious ... anyway apart from the excellent classics such as " Widow's peak", "Awake and Nervous" and "Just changing hands", you find here the excellent recording of "Universal Scam" (the choice of the sounds and the simple harmonic solutions too, make Mike Holmes a good remarkable guitarist); besides "Winter tell" seems suitable, in order to evocate and recall the period of the late 80's by IQ ... also the raw re-mixed version of "The Barbell is in", from their early period, is very interesting, even though it's quite weak from the point of view concerning its recording! Instead "Fascination", already included within "Nine in a pond is here", is not much cool ... nevermind I suggest this album to all the fans of a simple but anyway tasteful UK 80's new-prog; otherwise if you prefer the atypical - more complex -progressive music genre,stay far away from this collection ...

Well apart from its packaging, this CD contains the memorable &quot;A song for all seasons&quot; and other pearls, such as &quot;Can you hear me&quot;, &quot;Can you understand&quot;, &quot;Running hard&quot; ... the rest is more pop oriented, but quite good, even if this isn't completely essential...I prefer the BBC live session or the mythical &quot;Live at the Carnagie Hall&quot;,to have resumed some of the whole best stuff of their career. Anyway this CD could be an easy start concerning the Renaissance's history, if you don't know this fantastic band very much ...otherwise buy soon &quot;Turn of the cards&quot;, &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, &quot;Novella&quot;, &quot;Ashes are burning&quot; and &quot; A song for all seasons&quot;, even if this latter begins to turn to pop (except on the mythical title track and on &quot;Opening out&quot; too)Recommended, even if not completely essential ...

Well after listening to discs like these, I ask myself: "Why one of my favourite bass players/vocalists of the 70's, John Wetton, is not producing anything new and interesting as well? Where is his famous inspiration, that let him produce such jewels like UK's "Danger Money" or "King Crimson's "RED"? Has He forgotten the importance of producing intelligent discs, suitable for more meditative moments or anyway standing alone against the music stereotypes of the recent times, in a resolute manner? Well honestly I think of an artist who is concentrated more on himself than on his music research ... He has produced some solo works, of which I own the only one is worth, in my opinion,that is "Arkangel"... an AOR and acoustic album, in some moments tasteful...instead this live, performed with the former member of Uriah Heep Ken Hensley, doesn't add anything new, talking about their old stuff of course("Return to fantasy", "July morning","The wizard"). Such these songs are quite well executed, but without being helped by solid new arrangements ... morover the voice of John -unfortunately- isn't equal to that one-splendid- of the 70's/early 80's (listen to UK's second album and you understand the reason why...); nevermind, if you are a fan of Uriah Heep, probably you can't stand without listening to this "memorial" tribute, otherwise perhaps you will stay somewhere else, listening to a true work in progress!!

Sorry I can't agree with the point of view of the other reviewers completely!! I keep on thinking of their most successful album of the eighties, &quot;The jewel&quot; (what a pity for the weak production!!)and naturally it's clear to all of us:that album was characterized by their most personal style, as it could be an example to emulate; instead afterwards they became a derivative band (emulating the melodies of Camel, expecially the guitar parts, and also those one more floyd-oriented, instead of looking for a more original sound and starting their own musical path). The present &quot;Not of this world&quot; is not an exception, as for the lacking of a real progression in the development of the themes (I think of their recent work dated 1996 &quot;Masquerade Overture&quot; and-despite of some ingenuosness-you could find a certain growth within)and in the choose of the melodies-flyod oriented- as well!! The lack of inspiration, expecially regarding the compositions by Nick Barret, can not make us change ideas ... if you compare the last works by Pendragon with those ones of Camel, you can understand what I mean ...OK I try to be honest and objective, every album by Camel makes a new present to whom is looking for cool surprises, unlike the last albums of Pendragon, which let me quite indifferent!!

Sorry but I can't compare this work to the best 80's/90's UK newprog (including the commercial success of &quot;The sentinel&quot;), because this CD is without soul, even if it's well produced,by means also of many re-recorded synths and syntethic effects too.Perhaps the unique exception is the track &quot;Midas Touch&quot;, this track being anyway quite far away, though, from their best stuff of &quot;The sentinel&quot;.The problem is connected with the lack of fresh ideas, despite of my listening to this CD for several times I recognise a big improvement in comparison to their previous insipid and tepid works ... even if I can't remember any melody. This stuff-live on stage -works quite well,after all!!Recommended only if you like the newprog works lacking of complexity, otherwise listen to the best IQ and Pendragon's stuff or to Deyss' &quot;Vision in the dark&quot;, by which you can find a major complexity

Sorry for my low rating, but this time - in comparison to the impact of their best Studioalbum "Progressivity", I'm a bit perplexed about it!! Don't get me wrong, the product is good,the music well mixed and performed in a remarkable way (epecially regarding of theirexploration concerning the sound of their synths), but the style is radically changed, as itlooks like a kind of psichedelic genre, which sounds a bit strange for my ears... apart fromthis feature, sometimes their music is odd and very busy, but often resembling somepassages of another similar band - Brand X - in their most meditative moments, and for mesuch important elements could be enough to make this album worth checking out at least!!This is "alternative music" and "relaxed fusion jazz" in the same time, which is very interesting atthe end, so after burning this cd one more time I could give the product another halfstar...make your own choice anyway!!

Talking about this band I think of a quite original and not too much derivative ensemble, which certainly would have been listening to bands like Yes and Gentle Giant several times...in fact when you hear the vocal performances, that remind us of such this typical polyphony of the early 70's prog bands, I think of a mature and professional band, whose efforts should be rewarded!! Well talking about their defects, We recognise a certain tendency, typical of the young prog bands, to create an hard "wall of sound" close to the edge of "metal music" , but I can't gaze at Hamadryad as a usual prog metal band.The utilisation of Mellotron and acoustic guitars as well- make us think of a great debut - as They try to be an original heavy prog and experimental band... I hope that They will be able in the future to do better, especially when I think of the south american band Nexus, which did much better with its second album "Metanoia" and certainly can be compared to Hamadryad when they create the heavy wall of sound...anyway They won't forget the lesson of bands like the early Genesis and Yes anymore.

Well, thanks to this 3 DVD box plus 1 AUDIO CD - including the DVD versions of Exit.. Stage Left, Grace Under Pressure, and A Show of Hands - you have an important remastered work in dolby sorround in your hands for the first time and finally it's worth to buy it from every point of view!! As a matter of fact some critics have never completely appreciated the VHS version regarding these works, but now you could be immediately fond for instance of the Exit Stage Left live set, taken during a famous performance at Forum in Montreal, Quebec - cause the quality in general regarding the video output (good) and the excellent sound as well, make you follow their gig in a different manner!! It's a little bit uneven talking about the video sharpness - but you should appreciate all the features by means of a normal old tv - not the modern full HD TV - even though at the end it's a minor defect after all...the sound re-mixing is almost perfect and then you could be happy to see the performances concerning some great (or anyway very interesting) tunes such as La Villa Strangiato, The spirit of the radio or Closer to the heart, played very well inside the Show of Hands tour. Instead The YYZ/The Temples Of Syrinx/Tom Sawyer melody (but also the harmony which is well balanced) is a good mix within the Grace Under Pressure concert, which probably will you make prefer more Replay x3 than their live in Rio. Moreover track #ten Vital Signs is at the same level, being also an important contribution to such a great set of concert videos like the present unique one.Recommended, not for the collectors of the Canadian heavy prog band only!!

Finally the famous work by PFM, digitally remastered, let you appreciate its artistic quality, much better than the original recording... &quot;Harlequin&quot; and the title track as well are immortal classics; the track &quot;Out of the roundabout&quot; and &quot;From under&quot; are early Genesis-like and some of their best songs too. The voice of Bernardo Lanzetti is difficult to take, but the experience and fame He gained during his period with Acqua Fragile completed his personality in a remarkable way, as long as He reached his peek of career rightly when He recorded this important album with PFM. Afterwards part of this stuff was brought live on stage to USA (listen to the recording of this live, under the title of &quot;Live USA&quot;)Highly recommended !!

My personal favourite album by Renaissance, I choose this one along with &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;, followed by their first symphonic albums with melodic and pop colours: &quot;Novella&quot; and &quot;A song for all season's&quot;(these records having a few weak moments and a lot of memorable ones!!).&quot;Turn of the cards&quot; is a poetical and monumental romantic album too, equal to the best Yes albums and sometimes giving something more...well the first track &quot;RUNNING HARD&quot; is characterized by a fantastic epic piano intro, followed by the magical introduction by Annie Haslam, who performed according to her finest voice-tone ever!! A great performance and absolutely flawless too...&quot;Think of you&quot; is a sweet song, like a &quot;fairy-tale&quot;, while &quot;Things I don't understand&quot; is characterized by the final angelic voice's breakthrough, after the last symphonic excursus at the piano, enriched with the outstanding colors of Annie's voice, whose abilty to harmonize the melody is enormous and wonderful as well!! &quot;Black fame&quot; and the arrangement of Albinoni's Adagio (&quot;Cold is being&quot;) are worth songs and an excellent interlude towards the final mini-suite &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, which is enriched with amazing themes and the story of a famous russian dissident as well, even if the lyrics aren't always inspired (well the focuse is more on the instrumental performance than on the lyrics,nevertheless, is anyway flawless)Highly recommended!! Absolutely a must have album from Renaissance ...

Well, by excluding the old derivatives album in the vein of Peter Gabriel with Genesis (the Fish era I mean...), I think of the peek of creativity represented by their best concept album entitled "Brave", as well as to such good performances within the recent emotional "Marbles"...obviously if you're a fan of this hybrid music stuff in between the neo pop progressive of the nineties and the melancholic alternative rock nowadays, this latter music genre anyway being more shifted to pop rock, you could be indifferent; but actually such mentioned remarkable albums stand alone as the unique original episodes of a controversial career (remember the recent disappointing "Anoraknophobia" for instance or their usual albums focused on the vocals by S. Hogarth,being very "pop rock"- oriented). Therefore Marillion have arranged them in an elegant manner, but adding anything new or particular fresh in comparison for example to the mainstream approach of similar experimental pop rock bands in the USA (do you remember the recent albums by Echolyn or those ones by a few US bands like that??...). Anyway at the end you can find some remarkable chorus (like within "Last Century For Man" or once again within the controversial "Most Toys", characterized by some rough melodic lines), but their effort is a little bit pretentious. Also "No Such thing" is not a bad song, with its psychedelic mood and perhaps it's the most orginal track of the album along with "The Wound" , this latter being quite fascinating after all!So if you have appreciated "Afraid of Sunlight" you can't stay far away from the present "S.Else", even though the folky number of the last track doesn't represent the conclusive epic number you should expect; nevertheless it could be an easier way to make the recent issue by Marillion split from the general mediocrity of modern mainstream nowadays...

If you regard of the early sixties in the USA, this rock and roll/blues rock album was already quite progressive, even though in some circumstances only..that is you can get an inkling of his talent, which will be developed better in the future.In fact tracks such as &quot;Don 'Sugarcane'&quot;,&quot;Harris&quot; or &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot;, are a tasteful example of things to come later (listen to the experimental album &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh&quot;)...well these songs actually are almost equal to the most disappointing version of &quot;Gumbo Variations&quot;, which is more similar;nevertheless there are some stunning spare classic breaks through (of course I remark these latter as &quot;classic&quot;, regarding of his usual high standard).Moreover some of the themes will appear on other albums such as the &quot;Grand Wazoo&quot; and &quot;Waka Jawaka&quot;; while perhaps the song &quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes&quot; is the only one which is not much inspiring...it never minds, this work, not completely mature, is anyway worth checking out at least!!

Perhaps this is one of the most famous albums and of the best ones as well (perhaps the best one)...it's a sort of concept album telling the story of Joe and his role of &quot;Central Scrutinizer&quot;, as He's obliged to hold an unnatural behavior, within such role, till becoming an outlaw.The album begins with the accessible title track: Joe's Garage. After this easy intro, He becomes more and more ironical and quite bizarre too.Zappa doesn't perform a particular complex job with his guitar here,that is simply his typical rock and roll guitar solo, but his inspiration also in the lightest things is high as usual. Watermelon in Easter Hay demonstrates his skillful technique on guitar:his guitar playing inside is fantastic and as an incredible testament for his life, this song was played at his funeral...anybody, except on his Son Dweezil,won't play this &quot;cover song&quot; anymore!!At last all the songs for instance on Act I are a must-have,but this &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; in particular is an unforgettable tribute,whenever it can be played by a capable and amazing guitarist too!So this testament is essential for every kind of personal &quot;discoteque&quot;

Well there are some, among the most genial bands of the European scene, which are able to create a mix of incredible atmospheres, amazing themes and solos as well, which resume the best 20th century symphonic period, the style of F.Zappa and also the finest experimental Canterburian style (see also Univer Zero, Minimum Vital,Art Zoyd the latter-a few- accessible parts, After Crying in Europe, A Triggering Myth in USA, etc.)who are fantastic in their version live as well!! Isildurs Bane is a typical example of this situation and besides their studio production like "Mind Vol 1" is excellent. All the tracks are valuable and the same consideration I like to do for "Mind Vol II".Well the american prog fans have already "tested" the skill of this band during their important contribution to some American Prog Fests.Another winner!

Moreover you find the stunning version of other fantastic tracks: &quot;Running hard&quot; and &quot;Mother Russia&quot;,from the mytical &quot;Turn of the cards&quot;,which alone make this album well worth checking out and a must have to all the people with taste!! Such a pity for the lack of &quot;A song for all seasons&quot;, which came afterwards:We would have appreciated a live version of the fantasic title track; this album being regarded as the last good lp of the modern era,which could have been put into an historical Renaissance's dossier concerning their most considerable and remarkable steps too, all along their career:We would have got almost the complete best stuff,also from their live executions on stage!!...nevermind this CD is packaged with a jewel case, very pretty, and it's an absolute must have to all their fans.

Well this isn't a masterpiece,but in its own particular genre (a mix of those quite moments of &quot;Trespass&quot; by Genesis+the medioeval folkprog style by Gryphon)is an exceptional unplugged and tasteful album: listen to the 16-minute title track for example, which is enriched with beautiful themes on his acoustic guitar, or to the track &quot;Henry;Portraits from Tudor Times&quot;, the second instrumental piece of art,which is pleasant and well worth checking out!!Anyway the importance of Phillips in the evolution of the Genesis sound, in comparison to their immature and inconsistent debut &quot;From Genesis to revelation&quot;, was enormous! This solo work demonstrates and confirm my sentence...Quite essential for the lovers of the early Genesis (the &quot;Trespass&quot; era above all)

Well probably it's their unique work of prog folk to be a "master work" from the beginning to the end, as it can compare to the best albums (even in a different style) from Gryphon, Fairport Convention (these latter being anyway more folk rock oriented), Strawbs (with Wakeman in the vein of the Medieval music) and so on...well Mr Martin Cockerham and Mrs Barbara Gaskin were the true "master minds" of the band, where their creative genius is expressed by means of their alternating music composition, passing through the "spiritual" tunes and something more "psychedelic" (even though in an elegant manner), as well as quite complex arrangements...Cockerhams acoustic guitar is often intelligent (despite the uneven mix, which doesn't enhance it); while the music harmonies are enriched by means of such a good depth in the vocal intepretation, being perfectly "complementary" if compared to the guitar passages!! Then you find some orchestral instruments here, such as cellos, treated vocals, trumpets and flutes, making the atmosphere more "progressive"; the male vocal lines instead are quite simple, but at the end it's a minor defect in the economy of the ensemble!!This albums represents the beginning and the end of the best period for the band: in fact Mrs Barbara Gaskin, by entering the world of Canterburian Music after this experience with Spyrogyra, will join Hatfield and the North...however- after all- it's a remarkable album, especially if you're completely into such a particular prog-folk, even though I prefer another kind of prog-folk (more "symphonic prog oriented" I mean, a-la Renaissance...)

Well I think of a good place to start, because here you find a concert recording of the epoque before &quot;Overground music&quot;, plus some unreleased beautiful songs ... well actually the lyrics in hungarian language are difficult to take, but nevermind this album is interesting!! Besides the Chamber Rock, Rhapsody-oriented,of &quot;VANDOR&quot;, PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED,is special !! Moreover the band utilizes the acoustic guitar and the trumpet as well, suitable for an odd duet, in the track&quot; Novelty&quot;, which it makes this album very interesting.However-after this one- I suggest to you &quot;De Profundis&quot;, &quot;6&quot; and, after being in the habit with the most complex stuff by A.F., also &quot;Megalozottak Es&quot;: though this one is harsh and very experimental, and in some moments depressing...but if you enter the same wave lines of these genial hungarian musicians, you remain very satisfied at the end and to me it grows on you, as long as it becomes perfect... &quot;Elso Evtized&quot; is recommended, expecially if you get also the other above mentioned gems !!

Great debut album !! For me it's one of the best debut albums of the whole prog scene, despite of remaining anchored to simple structures and also classical rock stuff in some circumstances:naturally it's enriched with lush and charming atmospheres,by means of stunning and underrated orchestral keyboard arrangements!! It takes shape very slowly, by starting with some gentle romantic moods, afterwards leading the listener to an aggressive powerful meeting between the organ riff and some sensible guitar lines too("The falling tower"), as long as the concept is completed. It is a sort of communion between the complex and the mellower atmosphere in the same time ... "Death, The reaper" remains always mellow, nevertheless by introducing such a particular legendary theme They want to seduce the listener and lead him afterwards to the next following album (this theme will be recalled)... "The lovers" instead is their most symphonic track, but always remaining at its mellow side. Instead "The devil", in the opposite, is very energetic and quite typical in the UK 70's rock scene.The majestic theme of side 2 represents here their leading main concept theme, with its reprisal during several passages all along side 2. However the most classical music oriented, regarding of their symphonic tracks, is that one inspired by "Dies Irae" -the famous Mozartian composition - here entitled "The last judgement", which leads in progression to a grandiose section, based upon an epic choir and a mellotron as well, which are never banal!! Then you find the main refrain of "The sun" once again,here supported by a good trumpet - within a sort of short interlude -before playing the best track of the album, the title track, combining the medieval moods with a powerful guitar theme, till the conclusion and the final catharsis of the reprisal, regarding such concept theme, "The sun".Highly recommended !!

Well 4 stars is righter, if you regard a bit discontinuity in the song lay-out and in the composition as well... but the drumming style is extraordinary here, because Bill has been improving his style and versatility during his long course with bands such as Yes,King Crimson,Gong, Pavlov's Dog, UK, and so on, by earning his important fame as a great drummer, both in the fusion and in the Jazz style too(otherwise Art Blakey has been his master for some years);nevertheless He puts also his progressive style in some passages,above all in the odd signatures of his drum patterns, and I think of Allan Holdsworth as a perfect genial partner on guitar, suitable for this Bill's talent !! Highly recommended ...

It seems a mix of the whole types of rock music,within such hard rock and proto-prog scene of late 60's/early 70's(including also some funky stuff),even though the present issue is dated 1999. However this is the best side but also the main defect regarding this heterogonous/too much diversified work.Nevertheless the vocals are solid and the instrumental skill is almost equal to such music from the dinosaurs of the 70's!In fact the multi-instrument player(Craig Herlihy)plays so many different instruments here,such as the flute,dulcimer,marimba,mandolin, glockenspiel and so on,in a remarkable manner,which represents the gentle side of the band,in comparison to such prog metal bunches of instrumentals!! &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;,&quot;The Brook,the Mirror and the Maiden&quot; and &quot;Return Voyage&quot; is the trilogy, gathered in a mini-suite, whose songs are splitted...the main theme is performed in progress within each track,according to a metal prog style,but it's also in the vein of some medieval stuff, by means of a jethro-tullesque flute!! &quot;Ghost notes&quot; duplicates this latter style, with the contribution of a galloping horse, performed through a drumming excursion, which is very original ... finally you find the title track, the melodic rock song in the vein of some stuff by Rush and the conclusive &quot;Magic dust&quot; as well, a dignified piece of music,which resume the spirit of the whole album!!Recommended, even though this is not my favourite kind of prog music ...

Well usually I don't like space/kraut rock as much as neoclassical /classic symphonic PROG MUSIC (After Crying,Isildurs Bane,Anglagard, Mirthrandir, Yezda Urfa, etc.), but in this case, in comparison to the best german space works of Novalis,Grobschnitt or Nektar, this work stands in the same place without reserve !!The concept is about the rise and fall of Atlantis, whose narration -expecially in the track "Atlantis' Agony ..."- is a bit boring. Nevertheless, it sounds almost like Klaus Schulze and it is quite interesting. However,starting by order, the first track "Poseidon's Creation" is characterized by heavy organ riffs, enriched with an atmospheric moog theme and a majestic chorus at the end as well !!Besides the instrumental middle section concerning the track "The incarnation of the logos" is very interesting, making the sci-fi Eloy trademark a secure reference ...anyway their best trademark- the title track- is regarded as a true piece of art music, probably featuring their best stuff, even though I prefer the album "Dawn", here at Amazon.com not mentioned !!If you love the best space rock, you have to buy this album!!

Well this kind of new prog steers towards the style of Yes, expecially in the fantastic suite &quot;Vision in the dark&quot;; but proceeding by order first We can listen to the splendid &quot;Passage&quot;, a short instrumental characterized by the amazing strings and the voices as well,from the synths.These instruments are a perfect complement for the symphonic excursus of the guitar...then there is a typical melodic new prog song&quot;Take yourself back&quot;, with a pretty guitar and a synth solo at the end, but unfortunately here is also the &quot;swiss&quot; accent of the singer, whose name (Jester)is a typical new prog reference, as He tries to emulate Fish by Marillion, expecially in the album &quot;Script for a Jester's tears&quot;. For this reason I can't give 5 stars to this aggressive and epic work too. Anyway the first great approach -in the vein of Classic Prog -is the 1st amazing mini-suite:&quot;The untouchable ghost/Crazy life of Mr Tale&quot; where you find, expecially in the 2nd movement, the beautiful even if not completely original guitar solo and the epic aggressive synth solo as well!! This mini-suite gives notice to you in advance of the following last track of side 2 (before listening to this, you can apreciate a couple of captivating tracks, including &quot;Fifteenth Century Fox, quite unusual and original too, and a short good interlude &quot;Last Chance flight&quot;, which is characterized by an amazing, peaceful and &quot;wrapping&quot; atmosphere,expecially in the final interlude of the strings...Finally here We are!! The last track, that is the title-track &quot;VISION IN THE DARK&quot;, is one of the most inspired, epic suites of the last 20 years,with dark tones, captivating interludes and a great poliphony as well, created by a wall of fine synths (please forget only 1 minute of guitar solo, before the &quot;musical storm&quot;,where the lead guitarist Giovanni De Vita remains alone without any accompaniment!! And in this way He doesn't perform a memorable musical breakthrough...)but all the rest is fantastic and highly recommended (even if I must admit that the mixing unfortunately is bad, as for a mistake, but nevermind)One of the best new prog albums of the eighties, together with Pendragon &quot;The jewel&quot;and IQ &quot;The Wake&quot;, but I prefer &quot;Vision in the dark&quot;, dated 1987.Recommended not only to the fan of the 80's new progressive wave, but also is suitable for the lovers of Yes!!

Well here you find a very interesting video retrospective witnessing a couple of famousconcerts regarding the old line-up by Camel...featuring Andrew Latimer, Doug Ferguson, theunforgettable Peter Bardens and Andy Ward, without forgetting Richard Sinclair and MelCollins. If you regard of the old BBC sessions concerning their performance at London'sHammersmith Odeon or their concert at the Hippodrome- dated 1977- you can listen to theHammond organ excursions and other melodic lines at the minimoog too, performed by P.Bardens...but of course it's the perfect support to the pshichedelic and spacey guitar by Andy(inside "White rider" for instance, but also in their various instrumental numbers). That's thereason why a clever keyboardplayer coupled with the magic touch by Mr Latimer (talking abouthis guitar solo in "Lunar sea" or in the famous flute solo within "Rhayder", just to mention afew jewels!!...),seem to be the best features to contribute to the perfect music "alliance". Theywere able to create an intelligent sound of classic prog! Of course I prefer the modern gigs,like that one and unforgettable within the "Coming of Age" Live Tour concert, but never mindcause the present DVD is a must-have for the collectors of the best derivative and melodicprog band in the vein of the classic Genesis line-up and the symphonic period concerning theband Pink Floyd- as well. Moreover I like to make a special mention regarding the harmonic and rhytmical machine created by Andy Ward and Doug Ferguson together and... well you don't need to add anything else, so choose this classic number, even though I suggest you to buy also their last modern live gigs!!

What a pity for the weak production, because this work resembling the works of Curved Air is characterized by the presence of a solid singer, Sandy Leigh, whose voice is similar to that one of Jon Anderson by Yes... a pure contralto female voice; and moreover-apart from some weak moments- there are interesting symphonic/new prog breaks through, by means of a direct and essential guitar, nevertheless being always remarkable(listen to &quot;Brave new world&quot; or the best track of the album &quot;Return of Spring&quot;,where the violins create a stunning wall of sound)...well honestly the other tracks are a bit boring, sometimes uneven, even though the interpretation by Sandy is resembling always the 70's hippy-era and her songs are characterized also by a good arrangement. Actually this issue is not essential, even though I can suggest this stuff (and also that one of the next album &quot;Circles&quot;, after another controversial issue such as &quot;New life&quot; dated 1993,which is not essential once again),to the lovers of 70's classic light folk prog...

To me this is an excellent excursion into the remarkable career regarding the activity of K.Emerson as a musician. Since the early sixties He passed through interesting collaborations, as long as He became the most famous keyboards' wizard within the Progressive scene in the UK. it's difficult to choose a particular track here, but I think of his most recent tracks, whose production is very good..instead the old ones are weak from this point of view..it neverminds, this album can follow you, through your car travels all over the world, because it's very relaxing and of course very well performed too!!Good listen!!

I'm a bit disappointed, because usually I don't like the Anthologies very much, as I hope hearing discographic news from my favourite musicians, like Mr Emerson, more often...Anyway the piano compositions are quite typical and don't add anything else to the historical set by Keith at the Grand Piano. Besides I should have appreciated very much a new musical effort, as He has been producing Tributes or Collections for 6 years, instead of recording new albums or performing live on stage!!Talking about this work, I like the aggressive track &quot;Creole Dance&quot; from Ginastera very much;instead the pretty track &quot;Solitudinous&quot; is a very sensible piece of sweet piano.Unfortunately the rest is represented by usual ragtimes, boogie-woogie and the famous &quot;Honky Tonky Train Blues&quot; as well,Keith duetting with Oscar Peterson...but the recording lacks in dynamics and is sutable for the fans of Keith Emerson only!!

Well this work dated 1993, represented the reunion of this new prog ensemble, which had produced - before this release - a remarkable new prog album on 1991. Well the former clever singer, Sandy Leigh, reminded us of Jon Anderson by Yes and her role was that one of an excellent folk/new-prog singer. Now the new singer, Hedi Kemp, has a stronger impact on the listener in comparison to Sandy, but not in the manner of Renaissance, Curved Air, and so on, regarding of the best UK folk prog of the seventies...that is this new classic folk stuff reminds us of the less busy moments of Curved Air with hints of Marillion, but without the same solid arrangement and impact as their debut album (except on the weak production of this latter)... such stuff is discontinuos, even though there are some interesting music ideas which will be developed better in their next release &quot;Circles&quot;!!Interesting but not essential release from the U.K. ...

&quot;As criancas da nova floresta&quot; is the best gem taken from the album of the same title,this track representing the band at its peek: here the influence of Camel and generally of light symphonic/light Canterbury is evident ... the excellent use of flute, a tasteful guitarist(a bit Santana-like), and an interesting rythmical section too(honestly not always inspiring, but nevermind...),create a romantic picture. The right rate should be &quot;3 stars and an half&quot;, but this one is almost an incomplete collection, by considering also their 2nd album ; anyway if you don't find the album &quot;As criancas da nova floresta&quot;, you can start with this good anthology, covering their short career which ended in 1982 (recently they have been reunited for a brasilian prog fest-the famous ART-ROCK RIO FESTIVAL, but I think of a mere celebration ...). Well in the place of the pretty &quot; Memory of the apple valley&quot; there are couple of bonus tracks plus their epynomous-the 18 minutes suite-which was already included in their debut album: for this reason you are not obliged to look for their debut album, because you find almost the whole stuff from it, except on &quot;Memory of the apple valley&quot; ...Recommended if you appreciate bands such as the south american &quot;O Terco&quot;, &quot;Mutantes&quot;, &quot;Sagrado Coracao da Terra&quot;,&quot;Pablo El enterrador&quot; and the classic Camel.

This work is remarkable and quite amazing too,but in my opinion it's too much in the vein of the recent Echolyn,IZZ and the 80's Rush ...I don't get crazy for such works nor for the vocals, but naturally I find some excellent stuff within;instead I regard &quot;Suffocating the Bloom&quot; by Echolyn as an appealing masterpiece... anyway coming back to the present issue, I like to remark the good impression that I received from their sense of melody and the creation of a particular atmosphere as well:even though there's no trace of any bombastic solos or complex arrangements, this concept album, in the middle between progressive rock and space rock, maintains a certain balance, by means of fifteen tracks which often flow fluently.Besides the presence of a simple and essential piano, some good effects (like the run of cars passing on the highway), take the listener to a fine landscape... to me the best track is &quot;Hold a Candle&quot;, along with &quot;Flight&quot;, where you find an invigorating synthesizer.Instead &quot;Infractus&quot; is a melancholic tune, quite symphonic-like;and moreover,even though you don't find any bombastic solos, the keyboards excursions by John Green are quite fiery and intelligent!!Well now I stop reviewing such album, because I don't want to affect your opinion ... THIS IS A PROMISE ANYWAY AND IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT, DESPITE OF THEIR CLEAR MUSIC REFERENCES, REGARDING ALSO SOME DERIVATIVE INFLUENCES AS WELL!!

Actually the right rate should be 3 star and 1/2, cause the second side of the album (almost the whole),is in the vein of classic hard rock, which is not very original (even though it is in the vein of their debut album, which was not progressive and quite Deep Purple-like). The present issue is indeed characterized by a complex sound, expecially the keyboards by Zeus B. Held, a competent keyboardplayer and a good composer as well ... the sound reminds me of such german space rock;instead the guitar sound trademark is that one you find at the end of &quot;Trial trip&quot;: in particular such sensible final guitar excursion, which is a Bruno Frenzel trademark!!But proceeding by order, first of all you can listen to the excellent title track, written off as a song with beautiful instrumental parts and gentle vocals as well!! Instead the track &quot;Tiny Flashlight&quot; is more symphonic oriented in the middle section and sometimes reminding of the proto-prog sound of East of Eden in the album &quot;Merkator projected&quot;. Finally in my opinion there is the best track of the album &quot;My mind&quot;: it seems the german reply to Gentle Giant, but its sound is not at all like that stuff! The already mentioned &quot;Trial Trip&quot; is based upon an hard rock riff, but after few passages it turns to a symphonic guitar excursion by Frenzel, of which I have already talked to you ...this is probably the unique track of side two which is worth checking out;moreover the support of the mellotron is remarkable and well performed too!! The closing section is represented by a tepid song with a rather unoriginal and slick soul music stuff, but helped and improved by some horns and an interesting flute as well... better things had to come afterwards!!

Although I've listened to a lot of progmetal during the last twenty years (think of a few interesting bands such as Mastermind or Magellan in the recent times for example) substantially I share the same thought as Erik Neuteboom and Joey Kelly: I don't criticize the technical approach of D.T., whose solos are often outstanding, but rather I'm not fond of their way to compose as well as of the music colours They use...their suites, often lacking such an important dynamic mood that I need as a classical composer (the loud but also the soft tones within the same tune, I mean...), begin to annoy me after 20 minutes of solos; moreover Jordan Rudess on keyboards doesn't make me change idea about their music project all along their career...that's a certain sense of tiredness, though the present "S.C." is generally regarded as their best album since "Six Degrees" and their execution is often stunning as well, after all!Nevertheless - in my opinion - They need some fresh new music ideas to make a renewal of their old project or should think of exploring new territories (like in the albums by L.T.E. for instance). Otherwise if They don't try to change route, their music will be cloned by themselves forever as a continual loop and naturally their albums become automatically boring.At the end - if you're a prog metal fan - you couldn't stay too much far away from "S.C."; otherwise you could look forward hearing something new...I let you decide, as usual!

This is their debut, a promise, characterized by a marillionesque mood, enriched here with symphonic keyboards and lush ideas concerning the guitars... besides the dramatic vocal styling is not bad !! Moreover some conceptual lyrics, the presence of changing atmospheres and charming chords too, create a stunning armonic picture ... well I don't regard this band as the best one of the italian prog scene, but naturally the first two works and some stuff from their 3rd one as well, can be well worth checking out!!

Well actually I regard and rate this fusion prog album as "a 3 stars and half" work, in the average of the best Holdsworth/Bruford's stuff, except on some interesting symphonic music breakthrough, which alone is worth "4 stars" ("Presto Vivace", "Alaska" and "In the dead of night" are fine examples). The presence of Holdsworth seems quite forced here, because actually Wetton and Bruford would have liked their new album more and more, if it was "Crimson" oriented, instead Allan Holdworth obliged them to create a compromise with the best fusion style ... anyway the keyboards by Jobson are quite technological and suitable for such this jazzy style... I think of better things, which had to come after the split of Allan (He was more fond of some jazz improvisational stuff, for this reason- unlike Jobson- He couldn't repeat the same precise solos). This brought them to their break-up, transforming themselves into a keyboard oriented TRIO, ELP-like,but after adding the exceptional electric violin to the usual classic prog instrumentation!!. The result was the output of "DANGER MONEY" and "Night after Night",live in Tokyo(1979)which- apart from some "dangerous" mainstream stuff by Wetton - was enriched with the symphonic style of Jobson and Bozzio, survivors from the experience with the excellent Frank Zappa !!!.Recommended, but before this listen to "DANGER MONEY", containing above all- among other gems- the fantastic track "Carrying no cross" ...

Well this work stands alone so far and it's great also after 23 years!! The title track remind us of the best moments in King Crimson's &quot;RED&quot;,concerning the instrumental parts, instead &quot;Carrying no Cross&quot; contains probably one of the finest keyboards' solo in the hystory of prog music... The ballad &quot;Rendezvous 6.02&quot; is much pretty, considering an amazing Moog solo by Jobson; the track the &quot;Only thing she needs&quot; has got a quite modern sound, different and very distant from the classic prog tracks, with the wonderful drum pattern of Terry Bozzio in the introduction. &quot;Nothing to lose&quot; is the only commercial track of the album, in the mainstream vein , while naturally it's better in the live version of &quot;Night After night&quot; (the Tokyo show); talking about Caesar's Palace Blues I still prefer the live version, but anyway it doesn't affect the high quality level of the other tracks.This work represents John Wetton at his top, before changing his route radically!!

Well actually 4 stars is a bit superior than the right rate, as for the presence of a couple of pop songs, such as "As long as you want me here" and "Nothing to lose", (even if this one is arranged in a remarkable way, by means of an amazing violin and a pretty moog-solo as well!!) which can be skipped; these songs being not useful in comparison to almost the whole usual UK's prog stuff!!Instead, talking about the ballad "Rendez Vous 6.02", it's a very sensible song, which keeps on growing in a very aggressive manner, by means of a splendid moog-solo in the final part and an unforgettable music crescendo too!!The track "Alaska", following after the already mentioned "Nothing to lose", is characterized by the memorable performance of Eddie Jobson at the keyboards (such a pity you don't find here the incredible solo of "Carrying no cross", the best track of the album "Danger Money");while the fantastic track "Presto Vivace", where these three valuable musicians perform a magical - short and stormy too- instrumental, is the right intro for another jewel,"In the dead of night",an excellent symphony taken from their debut album. Afterwards you can listen to a memorable violin-solo, in the funny track "Caesar Palace Blues"(you have already appreciated a great electric -experimental- violin, in the track "Time to Kill"), which is an example of Jobson's grandeur... well at last I prefer the previous album "DANGER MONEY", but also this live is quite essential (expecially the fantastic performance by Terry Bozzio, an amazing drummer, the magic interplay with the keyboards and the memorable playing of Wetton on bass/voice too!!)Recommended, but first start with "Danger Money"

Well don't regard this one as another progressive effort!!Such new issue is the first release after the controversial album &quot;Snow&quot;, (this latter quite disappointing in some circumstances),too much emulating the ideas of &quot;The Lamb lies down on Broadway&quot; by the early Genesis ...instead this new work is without the writing, keyboard, and vocal performances of the original member Neil Morse, who left the band for some personal reasons or a sort of personal crisis. However already as from their previous work, He was not so brilliant like in the early albums by S.B.. Besides the remaining members are a bit forced to become leading vocalists, despite of being able to carry out some good music both vocally as well as instrumentally within their solo albums!Well as They are not like Gentle Giant, their task without Neal Morse is obviously more difficult!! But proceeding by order, I like to point out first of all that They are obliged to steer more in the direction of such &quot;poppy&quot; stuff, rather than facing the progressive aspects concerning their music... that was a typical mood inside the first half of their recordings; while here the heavier prog elements of bands such as King Crimson are disappearing,except on a few early Genesis-like breaks through, similar to those ones by the early &quot;romantic&quot; K.C.&quot;!! . The arrangements without the creative mind of Morse are more difficult, despite of the majority of these pop songs being natural and well performed here.For this reason, I should give an higher score to this CD. Finally this is good stuff and Nick Di Virgilio is not only a remarkable drummer, because He can also sing in a good manner...This album could represent the new direction of the band, which was not able to innovate their ideas in the recent times, becoming tired along with the last uninspiring stuff by Neal Morse.Interesting album, even though it is not essential!!

A couple of Gentle Giant classics, remastered together in one CD, let appreciate the original recording better, expecially that one of &quot;Free hand&quot; and in a remarkable way as well!!Starting by order, I remark the excellent work on keyboards by an underrated versatile keyboardist,Kenny Minnear, expecially his Hammond organ, in the 1st track &quot;just the same&quot; ... this intro being a perfect balance, between the G.G. sound and that typical one of classic prog!The second track &quot;On reflection&quot; is more complete, because there's a perfect team's work, focused above all on vocals (in the vein of &quot;Knots&quot;, contained in the album &quot;OCTOPUS&quot;), reaching of course the peak of perfection !! The title track is a G.G TRADEMARK, by means of a tasteful instrumental, with a fine piano before the whisper ... the rest is very strong, with a lot of surprises and the &quot;generous&quot; utilisation of MOOG synthesiser as well.Their usual odd time signatures complete the splendid picture.The second album is not bad too! Apart from some weak moments, the album is good: it starts with the aggressive title track, where Ray Shulman performs a great work on bass, in order to complete that one of organ/guitar, supporting the original riff as well. Moreover, in addition, you find the usual excellent poliphony of the vocalists in the manner of &quot;Knots&quot;, from &quot;Octopus&quot;, once again, well connected to the excellent keyboards' work. At last I have to make another special mention for &quot;Timing&quot;: the magical interplay among the diverse instruments create a unique blend...and also the amazing final track too (&quot;I lost my head&quot;), this song being memorable and characterized by the neoclassical effort, almost Stravinsky-like, by Minnear, well supported in a magnificent team's work !!Highly recommended !!

This work is eponymous for the best key's job in the ensemble of &quot;Teru's symphonia&quot;; by means of this album Motoi Semba introduces her romantic keyboard style, often in the vein of &quot;The ENID&quot;.That is a long suite of lush orchestral rock compositions,driven from Romantic-era classical music oriented (&quot;Renaissance&quot; mid-period)rightly to the style of &quot;The ENID&quot;;nevertheless is quite well enriched also with a lot of keyboards monophonic solos and a melodic piano as well ...in the opposite the guitar work is increasing its mood, during its progressive excursion, as long as the guitarist pitches his melodic fills completely. Of course this album doesn't reach the grandeur of for example Mugen's &quot;Sinfonia della luna&quot; or Teru's symphonia's &quot;Fable of the seven Pillows...&quot;,expecially from the point of view of its production and execution as well, but some music parts more &quot;Silvyan&quot; oriented are not bad !!RECOMMENDED EVEN THOUGH NOT COMPLETELY ESSENTIAL, BEFORE THIS ONE BUY TERU'S SYMPHONIA&quot;Fable of the seven pillows&quot;and &quot;MUGEN'S &quot;Sinfonia della luna&quot;

Well the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2,perhaps something more regarding this one as blues rock album ... it seems that &quot;Icarus II&quot; is introducing now a second version of &quot;Masque&quot;, but in a few passages you understand that this lp will be mainly pop-oriented(except on some citations from their glorious past!!). This album marks an important Livgren comeback, after that one - already announced - of Steinhardt, in their previous work ...the album is connected with such 70's american classic rock,but the melodies are quite original and captivating too. Moreover the arrangements are almost equal to those ones of the early glory days, and the output is not too much discontinuous, as there's a certain compromise between past and present!! &quot;Distant Vision&quot; naturally is my favourite track, reminding me of the magical epic atmospheres from &quot;Leftoverture&quot;, neverthless also the other pop songs are tasteful and often interesting, even though the vocals are not always brilliant and clear like in the old times ...nevermind!! This is an excellent album of classic rock, with hints of progressive music into some spare short instrumental.Not completely essential but a pleasant surprise from the splendid Kansas band!!

In the mid 70's Maxophone played an original jazz prog stuff with symphonic elements, sometimes in the vein of King Crimson and PFM, being anyway absolutely diverse and by avoiding also to emulate such those bands ... They were into the romantic prog stuff, but always according to a personal taste, which was helpful during their jazz excursion, by means of unusual instruments like horns, clarinets, trumpets and so on. Moreover in the istrumental track "Fase" you find a good "Frippian" guitar in between, alternated with classical breaks through; and naturally the english version of this album is equal to the original songwriting: in fact some english people told me that the english vocals are performed with a good english accent and it's OK for the international market... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ALONG WITH THE BEST STUFF FROM ARTI E MESTIERI!!

The beautiful mix of russian and indian music as well, by means also of some pretty songs like &quot;Carpet of the sun&quot; and &quot;At the harbour&quot;,contributes to make this album highly recommended...

Well you could add another star in the evaluation, regarding of the technical skill by J.L. Ponty, sometimes reminding me of another music genius- even though more versatile- such as Eddie Jobson...that' s the point, in 1976 the jazz fusion-genre in the vein of McLoughlin (sometimes disturbed by a more commercial stream, like within the first track "New County") was already an old method to think of introducing a few elements of rock inside a solid basis of experimental jazz...but for instance only one year after that performance (often in the vein of Mahavishnu Orchestra), there was the birth of a new super band like "UK", with the support of A. Holdsworth and the melodic touch by J. Wetton, in order to create an original mix of symphonic music and fusion, but in a modern and intelligent mood...Why wasn't Mr Ponty able to create something like that?! I don't know, but nevertheless "Imaginary Voyage" is a stunning performance anyway! For example the track "The Gardens of Babylon" is a strong tune, where the violin is powerful; but above all the title track (the suite) is a splendid mix between a cool fusion genre in the vein of Return to Forever and a symphonic touch according to the style by Yes...the unique defect is the risk of becoming a little bit repetitive in his performance, but I don't think J.L. Ponty is boring within the present album...perhaps a different modern approach could be more exciting (before I was reminding you of the early "UK", but I could mention also the roots of classical music by Echolyn, inside a strong basis of symphonic fusion...), even though at the end it's a minor defect regarding such a clever French musician like Ponty anyway.The present work is worth to buy!

I have already talked to you about the ability of Roger Hodgson to recreate the fascinating old moods by Supertramp, live on stage (listen to his new tracks &quot;Time waits for no one&quot; and &quot;Every trick in the book&quot;), but also during the reprisal of classics by his former famous band, when He recaptures so well such pretty musical atmosphere!! (see also my review of his CD SINGLE&quot;Open the door&quot;, where I have described my sensations during a live performance that I saw in Milan-Italy 1 year ago).Well Roger is the sound of Supertramp and the true Supertramp don't exist without him!!Recommended for the lovers of tasteful, dynamic and aggressive pop!!

It seems there's a great array, regarding the whole range of fusion styles, within their improvisational stuff!! That is, it's so difficult to label them within a specific fusion prog genre, because the band is able to change radically route during the executions of the songs, thanks to such a valuable bass player like Percy Jones, Marc Wagnon on midi vibes and drummer Frank Katz...besides the guest star John Goodsall (along with Percy Jones in the band Brand X, a piece of history into the fusion world!!)and violinist Mark Feldman, have got as much talent as this CD requires... moreover on tracks such as &quot;Wall to Wall Sunshine,&quot; the band lets Feldman and Goodsall lead the music session,through their talent, while Percy Jones really makes a great job on the track &quot;Frank's Beard ...instead the song &quot;7,584,333,4440 Miles Away&quot; is very long,as it's a 17 minutes track,where you can note all their influences, from Dixie Drags to Frank Zappa !!Of course this album requires repetitive listenings, but naturally it's worth checking out !!

Sorry for the low rate, but this work doesn't add any thing else in comparison to the greatest works of symphonic prog ... The timbre of the vocalist is a bit resembling that one of Jon Anderson by Yes; otherwise this recent US band, sounding in the middle rightly between Yes and ELP, hasn't composed an original debut album, nor They have showed any new fresh idea in the usual symphonic themes of the keyboards.Yet I trust this band, talking about their next productions... of course now there isn't any track which can be remarked by means of a special mention, nor this album stimulates an enthusiastic opinion: but if you look at other similar US bands(such as Cairo, Mastermind or the argentinian Nexus), at their debut They were criticized in the same manner, becoming more interesting afterwards ... for this reason also Alaska, in the prosecution of their career, perhaps will grow and produce something more original and personal.We look forward to hearing something fresh by one modern symphonic band under the leading course of PROG MUSIC(listen for example to the fantastic ensemble of After Crying -for these latter such label being absolutely appropriate to describe their incredible style- or to another great band, Isildurs Bane, coming from another planet!!)STAY ALERTED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE GROWTH OF THIS BAND IN THE FUTURE!!

It's almost perfect,even if this re-arrangement of the Mussorsky's classical opera is a bit "uncomfortable", above all if We consider the point of view of some critics/reviewers of classical music stuff... We forgive Emerson for having stolen another russian classic(this time the track is taken from Tchaikowsky's "Nutcracker", being such classic completely changed); but all the rest is enriched with their exceptional and amazing interpretation, according to an aggressive and stormy style (listen to the famous "Promenade" and the following precise interplay between the analogic keyboards and the drums)like that one of the fantastic "The hut of Baba Yaga" or the dramatic "The great gates of Kiev" ...well after this work ELP created another perfect sound architecture in the suite "Karn Evil 9" from the album "Brain Salad Surgery", but afterwards the band suffered a certain lack of inspiration and results.Highly recommended!! Start the ELP's stuff by means of this fantastic work !!

This is one of their best albums,my preferred one, from this prolific scandinavian band,characterized by great moments, sometimes weak and forgettable...for this reason the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2. But the first song &quot;RETROPOLIS&quot;(after a short match at tennis-table in &quot;Rhytm of life&quot;)starts with a monumental intro at Mellotron, followed by an epic,exceptional, guitar solo by Stolte (actually his entering is much similar to that one of &quot;The 11th earl of Mar&quot; from &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; by Genesis, but nevermind!), sometimes with some excesses and a bit long, but never boring!! I don't like &quot;Ryhtm of the sea&quot; which is quite tepid,while &quot;There's is more to the world&quot; resumes the best from Genesis and ELP&quot; with an epic interplay between the guitar and the keys, plus a captivating melody and a certain F.Kings' trademark of their own (apart from the weak voice of Stolte,who isn't the best vocalist, but anyway He's an excellent guitarist). After another quite tepid song, &quot;Romancing the city&quot;, there's is the best track by F.K., the exceptional &quot;Melting pot&quot;, this being their very personal symphonic interpretation of celtic/arabian music, with a lot of experimentations and some great guitar stuff too.Stolte is helped here by excellent keyboards, never bombastic, but always tasteful!! &quot;Silent sorrow&quot; and &quot;Judas Kiss&quot; don't add anything else to their accessible &quot;song-format&quot;, while &quot;Retropolis by night&quot; is characterized by some experimental sounds at the keyboards and it's quite interesting...&quot;Flora majora&quot; and &quot;Road back home&quot; conclude the album in a remarkable way, by means also of a &quot;new-prog&quot; solo at the keys...A must have to their fans, but recommended also to who can be interested to derivative bands with a certain personality (not the whole stuff by F.K. is personal or original, but nevermind...)

Well the present music effort dated April 2007 is very interesting, even though I have toremark a few defects inside, as for a certain spacey refrain within their main tunes, whichseem to be just a little bit forced , above all in comparison to their usual standard.Nevertheless there are some gems inside such as "My ashes", especially regarding of thestunning chorus performed by Wilson in the best manner...then you can appreciate the 17minutes long mini-suite`Anesthetize', the most melodic among their best tunes, as well assuch an interesting Alex Lifeson solo, introducing the most heavy part of the album!!Therefore I can't forget the psychedelic touch of `Way Out of Here', perhaps the mostexperimental song of the whole cd, but for instance the lyrics of "Sleep Together' seem tobe quite far away from their best moments, as a sort of controversial artisticexpression ...anyway the mood of their work is strong and quite original too, despite theirstrangest songs sometimes not being inspiring at all... so at the end make your own choice,especially if you are an old fan of the American band and you can forgive them this way forevery diverse - sometimes controversial - kind of expression you will find here!

Well, add another half star at least (or don't add anything else, by regarding of the uneven recording), despite of listening to a few "oldies" from the classic prog/romantic scene ("Roundabout", "In the Court of the K.C." and "Fanfare for the common man") being a bit strident in comparison to some more commercial/pop hit singles such as "Heat of the moment" or "A Ride easy", which could make me change idea about the present reunion...but it's a minor question, because except on a strange execution of the above hits (e.g. "Heat of the moment", where S. Howe is not completely into the riff and the aggressive guitar sound of his original take of 1981) as well as within their difficult intro of "Time again" (belonging to a few progressive songs of their debut album here just a bit uneven), the other songs are performed with a good impact, especially by John Wetton, whose voice is almost aligned to his glory days!! I think of a band with such a great experience, even though the set of keyboards used by Downes is not always suitable for their oldies and Steve Howe sometimes seems to be a fish out of water (except on his fine Blues Intersection - even though this latter in their recent concert in Italy at the gig of Asti Festival wasn't so impressive - and of course in the harmonization inside "Fanfare for the common man" or once again regarding of the best guitar parts within "Roundabout").Instead Palmer is always a precise drummer (forget a few breaks through only where the whole band is not completely confident) and as usual excellent in his drum solo or once again within the classic instrumental track from "Works" by ELP.Long Live Asia!!

Well perhaps the right score is 3 stars,1/2, cause the first side,being commercial and very strident in comparison to their usual light symphonic standard, is disappointing...instead the second side, starting with a famous toccata and fugue by J.S. Back, is a fantastic example of such versatility, regarding the job of Marcus Viana at the keyboards and violin as well...the presence of such epic symphonic keyboards and several magnificent choruses too, complete this unforgettable picture, sometimes a bit uneven, but always unique and original as well. However if I like to make an average of the right score, probably the righter rate is a bit lower...but I don't want to affect you opinion, so listen to the second side and then decide whether it's well worth inserting this album into your private collection of the best progressive albums of the nineties or not...for sure-according to my opinion-their albums &quot;Grande Espirito&quot; and &quot;Farol da liberdade&quot; are better, so make your own choice!!

Well I don't wanna give to this important work the maximum rate, as for a certain lack of inspiration in some melodic passages, expecially in those ones concerning the colors of the female voice, which is a bit monotonous in some passages...besides I expect more and more dynamic scales and armonic completeness from two composers keyboardists &quot;coupled&quot; together!! But the influence on some following light romantic symphonic works is evident; otherwise in some dark space passages they remain very well aligned to the best space rock german tradition, even if they are more &quot;early Genesis&quot; oriented. It's not a masterpiece, but a classic anyway;moreover it can well complete your collection of classic prog.

This is the starting point, that is the beginning of the second phase regarding such great career of this unforgettable musician!! To me the right rate is 3 stars and an half...according to the opinion of his wife this was the album indicated by her husband Frank as his most favorite, and if you listen to his first great orchestral arrangement and conceptual album as well, you understand such opinion!! He was involved with the experimentation concerning the utilization of a strange dialogue, by alternating it by means of orchestral instrumentals...a patchwork of small pieces of &quot;art-music&quot;, 16 minutes long!! Well honestly his definitive sound did not take its complete form yet, but you can get an inkling of his grandeur here and the influence of Stravinsky as well.&quot;Take your clothes off&quot; is a small jewel; instead the early raw version of &quot;King Kong&quot; doesn't convince his fans at all..it never minds, this is an important historical document, even though better things had to come after!!Recommended!!

Sometimes it's bizarre from the point of view of the ironical lyrics,in other circumstamces is less inspiring, but at last the output is very interesting...

This is a jazz-fusion album,with a classical orientation, which is quite similar to that one of &quot;Hot Rats&quot;,although it is a bit lighter in tone, despite of containing such odd instrumentation like horns and woodwinds...well these latter were not present within &quot;Hot rats&quot; and for this reason at last I prefer the present one (or anyway in some circumstances at least).The track &quot;Eat That Question&quot; is brilliant, but there are also other simply structured and remarkable songs. Sometimes this &quot;Eat That Question&quot; reminds me indeed of the memorable job at the electric piano and organ as well within some classic jazz albums, in the vein of George Duke;the whole job is filtered through a personal style of his own, thanks also to his wah-wah guitar-effect and some other strange tunes. The whole album is mostly instrumental, with a very few inspiring and less inspiring songs, such as &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;, which concludes the album in a simplistic and easy listening manner , but it never minds...This work is recommended, even though it is not completely essential!!

Wow, what a surprise !! FIRST OF ALL I LIKE TO REMARK THE ROLE OF THE VOCALS,BEING REALLY DIFFICULT TO TAKE AS SOMETIMES THE SINGER GETS ON MY NERVES,BUT THE FOCUS IS MORE ON THE MUSIC SYMPHONIC EXCURSIONS;BESIDES THIS FIRST IMPORTANT IMPRINTING OF THEIR OWN IS STILL TODAY VERY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THE JAPAN PROG SCENE. Well usually I don't like bands resembling the period of mid-symphonic Renaissance and UK 80's new prog too much, but actually in this case THE RIGHT RATE IS 3 STARS AND 1/2, EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD GIVE THE MAXIMUM RATE BY FORGETTING THE COMPLEX JAPANESE LANGUAGE, because-as usual-the Japanese artists often lack of originality ... BUT IN THE EIGHTIES THEY LEARNT THE LESSON FROM 70's MASTERS(THE MAIN PROG REFERENCES) VERY WELL, AND I LIKE SUCH STYLE!! First of all this is a well structured concept album dated 1990...NEVERTHELESS THE STORY PASSES THROUGH DIFFICULT MOMENTS, WHOSE MAIN REQUIREMENT IS A CAREFUL AND A REPETITIVE LISTEN TOO, in order to understand every single aspect of their music.It's a sort of fairy-tale, introduced by odd instruments such as the oboe, the bassoon and various horns; besides Teru Hirayama has got here a stunning arsenal of digital synths,helped by symphonic "patterns". The concept is also characterized by a certain medieval mood ... and moreover the use of a wide range of large scales and intriguing arrangements as well, plus a very interesting musical palette, make this album powerful and the most original among the derivative japanese works! Well the first comparison is with the fairy-tale style by Renaissance in the album "Novella", nevertheless the music structure of these japanese artists is often more complex and enriched here by means of a strange mood of their own!! The presence of Megumi Tokuhisa, from the remarkable band Magdalena, is very important;SHE SINGS IN HER NATIVE LANGUAGE,WHICH IS OFTEN SO DIFFICULT TO TAKE, EXCEPT ON A FEW PASSAGES!!Well I stop reviewing now, because I don't like to affect your opinion or exercising a certain influence on your idea too much!!In my opinion this work is highly recommended, even though obviously such style was not created by them for the first time, being invented by the symphonic Renaissance and then brought to perfections by bands such as Dice or - in a more simple vein- by The Enid (if you consider also the best UK 80'S New prog with elements of medieval music)You could do the right choice ... IT SHOULD BE ALMOST A SMALL MASTERPIECE BY EXCLUDING THE MAJORITY OF THE VOCAL PARTS !!

This album marks a further step beyond, in comparison to their debut album: this issue in fact shows the maturity of the band, even though you can note a certain &quot;high tension&quot; between Francis Monkman and Darryl Way, a couple of remarkable songwriters...on side one you find all the compositions written by the keyboardplayer Way, while within the second side you can appreciate such Monkman's songwriting!! My favourite song is &quot;Young mother&quot;, a superb track, where the moog effect is used flawlessly ...while &quot;Piece of mind&quot; is an evergreen within the 70's progressive world and a true must-have classic as well!!The only weak episode is represented by the track &quot;Bright Summer's Day '68&quot; and moreover the biggest hit &quot;Back street Luv&quot; to me can not stand in the same place as for instance the suoperb &quot;Piece of mind&quot;, but definitively this album is well worth checking out!!

This time you can add another half star, cause usually my rate regarding the music of Saga is more precise, but in this case - as it's a live album (as well as the first time I review a live performance from the Canadian pop progressive band), I let you decide within a narrow margin and according to your own preference. Well talking about the double CD, in particular the first one covers all the successful albums of the eighties such as "Worlds Apart", "Images at Twilight" and "Silent Knight", divided into easily recognizable chapters (from 1 to eight)... the style is in the middle between the melodic pop progressive by Asia and the easy approach by Styx, passing through the settlement of a derivative style in the vein of the Neo-Prog movement from the UK, but in a more personal and intelligent manner (some way more modern and "technological" too - in comparison to a few interesting English neo-prog bands such as IQ or Pendragon, even though these latter groups have been closer to Genesis with Gabriel - unlike Saga...). Disc 1 includes some important hit singles of the eighties - sometimes reminding me of Pallas - and despite of being performed in a remarkable way, such songs don't add anything new in comparison to the studio version. Instead disc 2 covers their recent years from "Full Circle" to "Marathon", passing through "House of Cards", another interesting chapter of their career, even though the lack of songs coming from their best album - in my opinion - entitled "Generation 13th", let me stay a bit indifferent...you know I prefer another kind of style, but I recognize Saga as an excellent band, especially talking about their music skill, as They are remarkable musicians; instead their compositions are not brilliant at all in some circumstances (unlike within "Generation 13th") and I'm sure that every Saga fan will give the present live a major score...make your own choice as usual!!

Well this is a debut album of a controversial spanish prog band, which is quite Yes oriented,characterized by a certain research for enriching the music harmony ... here you find also some spare references to the classical spanish authors and some flamenco rock stuff in between!! The common places of classic romantic prog, within this short concept album, are anyway well hidden and naturally the arrangement and lush simple interplays as well - between the keyboards and the guitars-are very interesting ... of course They have reached the maturity as from their third album only (&quot;Mindscapers&quot;, dated 1997), but you already begin to understand such possible evolution in their next efforts,as They avail themselves of new interesting musicians of the iberian scene (be careful with the next prog gigs in Spain, such as the Ibiza prog festival and with the participation as well of new spanish prog bands...anyway some Italian groups such as Le Orme, the main headliner of the previous edition, should complete this gig).Instead talking about this line-up of Galdriel, They are not as genial as other neoclassical symphonic and more experimental european bands (Isildurs Bane and After Crying for example), nevertheless their debut album and - above all - their last effort &quot;Mindscapers&quot; could complete your european classic prog collection of the nineties ...expecially the 11 minutes long mini-suite, &quot;The year of the Dream -Summit&quot;, which is their first stunning example of their good talent, nevertheless there is also a certain discontinuity in between , as a sort of tribute, due to their young age and the consequent ingenuity as well ... then you understand here their possible development of fresh symphonic ideas in the future, filtered through the etnic iberian tradition.Their attempt will be partially failed in their second album &quot;Chasing the dragonfly&quot;, but recovered afterwards.Recommended, even though it's not completely essential ...

It's well worth checking out!! Well in my opinion the previous issue of Rajaz was a typical &quot;Camel trademark&quot;, that is a modern sound characterized by a certain sad mood, carried out melancholy by Andy Latimer, without bombastic solos. His first concert in Italy so far, in Turin (October 2000), was a great show and I like to remark the good work of Guy Le Blanc (leader of Nathan Mahl) at the keyboards. Now such these vintage keyboards are so important in the new &quot;A nod and a wink&quot;, a very good support to Mr Latimer last effort, representing a new direction as well.The melody is always catchy together with this quite classical armony and mood, created by Guy Le Blanc!!Thank you Camel, you keep on arranging and playing tasteful albums, which touch our soul!!

&quot;The wrong side of Weird&quot;, the first track, starts with an excellent &quot;incipit&quot;/epic intro (according to the typical imprinting of IQ,which characterizes the start of every album), becoming a bit tepid afterwards, even though the guitar harmonic lines are always interesting. The title track is quite catchy, but I don't think it's the most representative of this album. Instead- in my opinion - the best and most personal track is &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a dramatic piece, which is introduced by the usual wrapping atmosphere created both by some pretty vocals (a Nichols trademark, when He's not involved in the emulation of P. Gabriel) and the morbid M. Offord's keyboards as well !! Even though this kind of &quot;colors&quot; are a bit too much ripetitive all along the album, nevertheless the instrumental parts are excellent and equal to those ones contained into some mini-suites (such as &quot;It all stops here&quot; from their early steps or &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; from &quot;EVER&quot;), according to the traditional IQ reinterpretation of &quot;Cinema show&quot;. In the final section, the interplay between the guitar and the keyboards is tasteful and necessary during their executions live.Moreover, coming back to the previous songs of the album, I have to remark the solid melodic line of &quot;Zero Hour&quot; and that one of &quot;Erosion&quot; too, whose dark mood is another IQ trademark, but such these songs aren't memorable all along their duration.In this way,unlike their classics being naturally better,the atmospheric songs make this album interesting but not completely essential...otherwise the present work has got the same defects concerning the previous double album &quot;Subterranea&quot; (of which the majority of their fans like a few gems only, almost the whole best ones within the 1st disc), but naturally it's less prolix than it and in some moments remarkable too...

Finally a modern accessible Opera Rock, which can be appreciated by a wider crowd oflisteners (not for the prog fans only!!), of course with the same mood of a musical, eventhough I can not say it's equal to the 70's majestic opera rocks, such as "Jesus ChristSuperstar for example or the good work by Who entitled "Tommy"...nevertheless it'ssuitable for a thrilling music event live on stage (as foreseen in the next concertprogramme of 2006), starring the whole old line up of PFM, plus a few guest stars, as wellas a young talented female singer called "Dolcenera", singing in the final track "Un Destinodi Rondine"... the good and the evil living together, the perfect representation of Dracula,this latter character already represented in the cinematographic masterpiece by F. FordCoppola and here helped by the orchestral sections and the symphonic chorus as well,really delightful ; it's strange that it's the second concept album only, after thecontroversial (and quite disappointing too) "Ulisse" dated 1997, as They try to be involvedin the development of a famous story and this time reaching their goal in a lot ofcircumstances: in fact the style of PFM is inspiring both in the accessible classic rock genreand in the symphonic breaks-through as well, close to a kind of classic music and with acertain creativity which is often remarkable. The lyrics by Vincenzo Incenzo are clever, thanks alsoto the melodramatic passages (think of the overture): of course it's not aprog masterpiece nor strictly a progressive concept album, but their music taste is alwayspleasant, being able to represent the various dramatic and romantic moods!! It should be worth a "3 stars" righter score in comparison to their best albums ...long live PFM, anyway!!

Well this pomp/melodic prog metal band has arrived at its possible roundabout, that is: They can come back to their roots, with a typical sound belonging to the American/canadian pomp (listen to Saga for example)or going beyond, by choosing the new style,which is closer to that one-melodic-of any traditional prog metal...in fact the instrumental intro it's the typical sound of classic prog, with an interesting interplay between the keyboards and the guitars (usually They utilise the synths in order to enrich the sound,not as a solistic bombastic instrument, otherwise maintaining sometimes such a strong interplay, sustained by the powerful guitar), which introduces the enter of the melody, with its typical pomp sound.The melody isn't so much amazing (even if the guitar is a strong support here) and it continues in the same way till the intro of the pretty mini-suite"Fantasma Theme/The real escape (with the presence of great violins)and its prosecution with the fantastic crescendo of "Whatever it takes"!!The last three tracks, dedicated to their former music assistant, unfortunately dead, has a certain mysticism and remains linked to the theme of death, but without gothic tones or those ones typical of an horror soundtrack motion picture!!My problem with this album, when I try to listen to it from the beginning to the end, is the presence of a certain discontinuity, this CD lacking of real inspiration in some passages and without keeping the concept album coherent till the end...but the quality recording is excellent, sometimes mixed at an excessive volume, but always clear!!Recommended also to the fans of melodic prog metal (even without peaks of inspiration), but being conscious that their roots are close to the pomp sound of their debut album.

Some stuff here is essential jazz progressive by Canterbury, but ther rest isn't always inspired in comparison to their last works as from the 6th, 7h work till the important 11th album...but the impact on the following works by the first raw experimental canterburian bands(Matching Mole for example)and the other most refined albums from the experimental Canterbury as well, (National Health, Hatfield and the north, etc., for examples)is enormous. Certainly this work is quite immature if We compare this to &quot;Mind. Vol.1&quot; by Isildurs Bane, but We must admit that Soft Machine probably didn't know anything about the early Zappa Stuff; for this reason its jazz canterburian style had established the first roots, this being a bit immature yet...Highly Recommended as an historical document, even if not essential!!

This symphonic album from Sweden, characterized by a complex suite, is one of the most underrated albums of late seventies, a great and important reference too, regarding some Swedish bands such as ANGLAGARD, SINKADUS and FLOWER KINGS. Naturally the focus is more on the instrumental passages than on the vocals, but the output is anyway excellent. The problem regarding the weak vocalist was quite important within their second album, dated 1978 and simply entitled "DICE"; instead the present first jewel, released on 1977 and issued on CD on 1992, except on a few prolix parts (for which it could deserve one star less), generally is highly recommended...

The title track instead is a fantastic symphonic instrumental piece of versatile music, with the great work at the violin of M. Viana, and &quot; Deus Dancarino&quot; as well, with the excellent work at the keyboards. I like to remark the final catharsis through the sweet melody and the great feeling!!&quot;Gloria Das Manhas&quot; represents this sentimental excursus and the pastoral side of the band as well...Listen to this, but don't forget other great albums like &quot;Grande Espirito&quot;, &quot;Farol da liberdade&quot; and the second side (the symphonic one) of &quot;Fletcha&quot;

It's one of the best French prog albums ever made...sometimes their style is different, closer to Mahavishnu Orchestra, but in the other circumstances their standard prog is "aligned" with the same impact, as within the albums by Ange and the other best Romantic Prog Bands!Well honestly I don't get crazy for their hystrionic vocals,neverthless I recognize their personal and very interesting approach inside their experimental music passages,reminding me sometimes of the fusion style by Arti& Mestieri!!For instance the track Cazotte no 1 is different, in comparison to the music "clich&egrave;" within the progressive rock scene at that time, but also the other tracks are excellent and complete this good work...well check it out at least!!

Well the present issue is almost equal to "Imaginary Diseases" - talking about its power of invention - as well as a very good recording which has been re-mastered by Bob Ludwig in a remarkable manner!! Of course the inventiveness of the early period is more evident, but here is a sense of emotional music breath which is hidden behind the corner: thanks for instance to the drumming by Chad Wackerman - a genius (often inspiring the style of a few great drummers such as Terry Bozzio and Bill Bruford for example ) or regarding of Dweezil Zappa guitar with his fine solo within tracks 1 & 16 (except perhaps toward the final part of "Chunga s Revenge", being just a little bit uneven); therefore think of the magical touch of "Light is All That Matters" and ""Bowling on Charen", where the inventiveness of the guitar is great!! The tour dated 1988 and 1984 witness the last period concerning the career of an immortal artist, even though the majority of his fans is more involved with his old stuff...never mind, this is another "must-have" for the fans and one of the best live performances by Frank...remember him!!

This issue truly deserves the attention and the maximum respect, among the seventies classics of progressive rock!! It is an involved concept album into the political points of view and commitment, sometimes facing the question of various religions. In comparison to &quot;Fairyport&quot; this album is less accessible, by means of captivating melodies and odd songs... naturally at the first listen such weird songs disturb us a bit, nevermind because the great use of strings and other &quot;wind&quot;-instruments, make this album well worth checking out !Moreover some spare jazz-influenced stuff are evident here (listen to &quot;Pedagogue&quot; with the clever use of the clarinet and the flute as well... or to &quot;Prophet&quot;)and the output is excellent!!A classic one!!

This was their fist progressive attempt (after two issues), a song based progressive rock with elements of jazz and classical music ...BUT THE RIGHT RATE SHOULD BE 3 STAR AND 1/2, AS THE LAST 17 MINUTES SUITE - A NOISY ANSD SLOPPY LIVE JAM - IS QUITE WEAK AND NOT USEFUL!!Moreover the piano and the organ are always the dominant instruments here and I don't like this situation very much; nevermind, because stunning tracks such as &quot;Hot mice&quot;, &quot;One more try&quot; or &quot;Gray trators&quot; are the best example of their symphonic influence within their music, sometimes in the vein of The Enid...the songwriting is good and the keyboardplayer Jukka Gustavson has been always the progressive soul of Wigwam; while on the opposite Jim Pembroke represents the lightest and less interesting side of the band !!Good, even though not completely essential,70's finnish progressive rock album ...

Well finally the album &quot;Novella&quot; is well represented (my complaint in the previous &quot;Tales of...vol 1 regarded the lack of such jewels from Novella and also the absence of the title track from &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;, here present ... but I didn't know the choice of the songs inside vol 2); instead the absence of &quot;Opening out&quot; from &quot;A song for all seasons&quot; is hard to accept...moreover some tracks from the disappointing album &quot;Azure d'Or&quot; are not so memorable in my opinion, apart from the usual stunning vocal performance by Annie Haslam!! The output is anyway good, as for the presence of the fantastic track &quot;A song for all seasons&quot;, and for this reason I let you make your own choice!!

Well the album &quot;Novella&quot; is not represented here, but also &quot;Ashes are burning&quot; is almost completely absent (except on the tracks &quot;Carpet of the sun&quot; and &quot;Can you understand&quot;). Usually I don't like such collections, even though I must admit that instead both &quot;Turn of the cards&quot; and &quot;Scheherazade&quot; are well included within; and moreover the ouput is quite excellent for a novice, such a good representation of their remarkable career.Otherwise I can't feel to recommend this anthology- as a perfect place to start-to every one who wants to know the best Renaissance stuff;in fact despite of containing some of the best pieces of music art,regarding their most famous and probably best albums, you don't find here some other jewels (I think also of the splendid title track within the album &quot;A song for all season's, which is probably their best symphonic prog mini-suite, or &quot;Can you hear me&quot; from &quot;Novella&quot; -another must-have- which unfortunately have not been included here.)Remarkable,even though not completely essential,collection by Renaissance...

Well this collection is - in my opinion- essential, even if &quot;Tales from the lush attic&quot; is uncompleted here (it's inserted partially into a medley only), but all the rest is an excellent synthesis of their different periods (some live stuff, some from the studio's and the live tracks as well). Here you find a fantastic version of the track &quot;IQ&quot;, with a great intro in the vein of some classical music; but also the magical piece of art and complex rythmical structure as well of &quot;It all stops here&quot;, which is well represented. I like to point out one defect only: that is the presence of Paul Menel, performing LIVE some famous compositions by Peter Nichols -except on &quot;IQ&quot;, whose voice is less adeguate and suitable to sing according the famous &quot;Peter Gabriel style&quot; (of course in comparison to the actual Pete Nichols' performance)...anyway at last I prefer Paul Menel than Pete Nichols, especially when Paul sings his own songs!!On tha basis of the above considerations,this collection represents almost all the essential stuff by IQ, except on the 90's albums(&quot;EVER&quot; and &quot;SUBTERRANEA&quot;) and on &quot;THE 7th HOUSE&quot;, issued on 2000. It could be a good start to appreciate the old stuff by this prolific band from UK.I'm not dissappointed, even if I think of the Menel stuff splitted in another album, but nevermind...RECOMMENDED TO THE LOVERS OF TASTEFUL MUSIC!!

Their attempt to polish the old sound of 80's NEW PROG has been very appreciated, even if the fans of the early IQ aren't satisfied at all...so they have been able to compose according new fresh ideas, that is a fluid rock with a few complex music breaks through (apart from some ingenuosness, like the tepid riff of &quot;Out of nowhere&quot;);certainly they have made the sound more mainstream and accessible, but naturally they haven't forgotten the way We like the complex poliphony of the keyboards/guitars,including the complex rytmical patterns on drums, by means of odd signatures and the modern technology as well.Honestly Paul Cook has become less original and complex in comparison to his origin, this album being of course a bit prolix and repetitive, also in the rytmical parts,by supporting the refrain without fantasy(except on the first intro of &quot;Out of nowhere&quot;, before declining into the banal guitar riff). Generally this album seems boring, expecially in the middle section of the suite &quot;Further away&quot; and in the dramatic/quite melodies too, where the voice of Nichols is a bit tepid..but it's not the definitive sentence.In fact They have demonstrated their excellent shape and maturity too,above all in their recent gigs concerning &quot;Ever&quot;(the mini suite &quot;Leap of faith&quot;, resembling sometimes the grandeur of &quot;Cinema Show&quot; by Genesis, is a stunning example...)and of course in the essential guitar scores, performed also acoustically by Mike Holmes, these latter often being tasteful and much personal,despite of his paying sometimes a tribute to the best Hackett!! The last track &quot;Came down&quot; is the dignified conclusion of a memorable album , even if not completely original...Recommended, but if you like something else- more complex- in the field of UK new-prog, try &quot;Tales from the lush attic&quot; or the remastered picture CD of &quot;The wake&quot;, before this

This album is equal to their previous issue &quot;Nomzamo&quot;, from the point of view of its production,instead the compositions are more solid and some tracks such as &quot;Nostalgia&quot; and &quot;Falling apart at the seams&quot;, have been included into a lot of official live recordings (with and without the singer Paul Menel)for some years consecutively (1989-1994).Besides the track &quot;Wurensh&quot; resembles a bit the 70's progressive era, even though with a modern touch and a quite simple music structure too: here the strong rhytmical section introduces the vocals,just followed by the keyboards overlap and the following aggressive guitar solo by M.Holmes;afterwards Menel starts to sing and honestly his vocal section here is a bit tepid in comparison to his best intepretations of the past(listen for example to &quot;Common Ground&quot; from &quot;Nomzamo&quot; and you understand the reason of such gap),but for sure the focus is more on the instrumental passages and the output is anyway convincing ...instead the presence of the same song, re-proposed both from studio and in the live format as well,&quot;Nothing at all&quot;, in my opinion is not very useful, but it doesn't affect the final result of this very good album. If you appreciated their previous issue, a well produced modern new-prog with poppy elements, this one is an important step closer a definitive improvement of such modern style... you can choose this issue or refuse it if you are strictly a 70's prog fan, neverthless to me this lp is worth checking out (otherwise the song &quot;Wurensh&quot;, the solid track within the present album, was chosen for their best collection of the decade, entitled &quot;J'ai Pollette D'arnu&quot;, and this means a lot to their fans!!)...well actually the other songs are quite tepid and less convincing-except on the already mentioned tracks &quot;Nostalgia&quot;and &quot;Falling apart...&quot;: for this reason the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2;however the production is excellent once again and it cuts a fine figure among the best and must-have new prog albums (honestly a very few ones!!)

Such an epic and remarkable DVD/BLU RAY, a sort of "surprise" for all the old fans too !!Mr Greer and Mr Ragsdale join together within an important line-up and, once again, They are supported by three American "heroes" of the so called "pompous rock", such as Mr Ehart, then Mr Williams and S. Walsh (always present within the classic line-up of Kansas) and especially nowadays...in particular Mr Ragsdale is so exciting in the execution regarding the classics by Robby Steinhardt and at the place of this latter He's very powerful anyway!! Steve Walsh plays with a great sound, being fresh and perhaps also better in comparison to his unforgettable old style!! Think of his progressive rock style and AOR as well during the late seventies, which is memorable also after all these years and- at the end- you're almost obliged to to recommend the present great show anyway, celebrating their long live career of their last 35 years...Talking about the immortal tracks inside, like their epic ballad "The Wall" (enriched by means of a great symphonic arrangement ) or also by considering some other flawless performances within tunes like "Song For America" ( a true "manifesto" of the band), you don't have to add anything else. Moreover, by thinking of "Cheyenne Anthem" (this latter an exciting song with a great symphonic progression) and the emotional violin of the ballad "Nobody's home" too, you have to listen and listen once again (but also the coreographic aspects of the video are not bad) and you can't ask for anything else!!Excellent quality record and the video as well!!

Why reminding you of an interesting poppy turning point of their career, with this Verit&agrave; nascoste" it's so important, in spite of appearing more simplistic? Perhaps because the band in 1976 was able to maintain the old spirit, like within "Contrappunti", even though by changing their way to compose the songs...well of course their approach became less proggy and more song-oriented, as the present act brought about a certain criticism all around the media in the late seventies, especially regarding of a reduced contribution by T. Pagliuca at the organ...in fact, unlike inside "Felona e Sorona" and naturally "Contrappunti", where the instrumental numbers, enriched by means of some "epic" analogic effects, seemed to be the unique and true essence of the Italian prog ensemble, here the synths were less used and the music approach completely diverse as well...instead, in spite of lacking some typical and strong elements of a certain "symphonic prog rock", which were so important in the early seventies, the output was good, thanks to their music taste (think of the opener "Insieme al Concerto", with its memorable melody after the good intro at the acoustic guitar); then thanks to the rhytmical tune "In Ottobre" (note: the sessions at the Recording Studio in London began and were completed on October, 1976 ); and the third track- the title-track- which remained a good song, being aligned with the previous two songs!Probably their effort in creating something more mainstream (a certain commercial rock) was driven by their music producer; otherwise in the period between 1977 and 1980 the Punk music was able to destroy one decade of great British art and prog rock, as for the policital rebellion, which made a disturbing invasion also in the world of music; so Le Orme were careful, in order to avoid their typical sound in the vein of ELP, and to earn new fans...nevermind if the other tracks are not always inspiring and sometimes more simplistic, in comparison to their glorious past.A different album from a quite remarkable band (one of the best ones in Italy- especially during their executions live on stage- and for me that's enough!!).Non-essential but anyway important example of mainstream music, by Le Orme.

Well the present new effort by Aldo Tagliapietra with "Le Orme" is so close to the spirit of his solo-albums, but it's quite modern in the same time: that's a kind of "New-age", a personal interesting language, inside a "Light Symphonic apparatus", already used within their previous albums "Elementi" and "Il Fiume"...moreover it's a kind of return to their delicious music features contained into some progressive pop albums like "Florian", but according a different music style, a sort of new "Celtic" spirit!! A relaxing mood it is, without any peak of invention, comparable to "Contrappunti" or the early progressive atmosphere of "Collage",but of course it's worth checking out. Besides I like to remark its diverse atmosphere, in comparison for example to the dark mood of "Felona e Sorona", probably their best album,which makes this new album a quite recommended work... By completing your personal collection regarding Le Orme- "L'infinito" is tasteful, as I like listenining to it without being too much involved...it has got a strong personality and cause of all my explanations above it deserves also a major score (another half star at least): after all "Le Orme" are one of the best Italian Progressive Bands of all time and- even though the present suite is a bit inferior than their best albums mentioned above (but never "dated")- check it out anyway and perhaps add something more in the final evaluation!

Such a remarkable cult band, coming from the Canterburian scene: often in the vein of Hatfield and the North- as well as of the most experimental side concerning the versatile guitarist Steve Hillage (without regarding the interesting bassist Nick Greenwood-former Crazy World of A. Brown- and Dave stewart at his first turning point of his career as a keyboard player), this British line-up was important for the whole experimental scene in the UK...well not only for the long instrumental passages, but also regarding of the intelligent improvisation (do you remember the album "Rotter's club", by H.& the North?), Khan reached his peek of imagination and creativity as well, with "Space Shanty"...ok perhaps there are better albums within the Canterburian scene (witouth thinking of bands like Gong), but unlike these latter, here the features regarding the progressive rock style or the fusion rock music genre are much more present in comparison to their jazzy and psychedelic side...at the end the re-mastered version is well worth checking out at least for every prog listener and a must-have for all the Hillage's fans!

Their best live act on stage, witnessing both the "golden period" regarding "Chronometree" and "Lex Rex" (above all this latter for its importance as a personal "emulation of their own" concerning the music of ELP and Yes)- which is well worth checking out after all!!Certainly We are just a little bit disappointed after the controversial album "Three Cheers For The Broken-Hearted", whose music and ensemble as well (apart from the good vocalist Susan) could be their definitive choice for the future and I don't know whether it's satisfying or less, talking about the preferences of the old fans...well I hope that They will be able to produce such a good stuff like that unique of the early period (even though you could prefer the old stuff live by the original Yes, but nevermind...). However the present performance within an interesting DVD such as "Lex Live", is an important example of their skill live. Unfortunately their technique has been forgotten in the recent times, but probably the new ensemble of G.H. is looking for a personal music path and a new place too, within the modern progressive world (for me too it's the same, cause I know- as a musician and symphonic composer- how difficult it is, nowadays!!)...Moreover I like to make a special mention both for the beautiful album cover and the good video and sound master as well...anyway, perhaps the new ensemble will decide to come back to their roots and the present "Lex Live" won't be an episode apart concerning their career! So you can buy it, at the end!

Well the presence of John Wetton,a bit depressed during that period, who was coming back to an important live scene outdoor after a long silence, affected the output of the tune "Starless"; in fact his last excellent perfomance was that one witnessed during the famous gig in Tokyo by Steve Hackett (see my review here at Amazonl.com).Instead in this new witnessed live in Hungary, Wetton is performing with A.C.,without the same aggressive approach, and for this reason the execution of that famous song by King Crimson wasn't memorable!! Here is the reason for which I can't give the maximum rating to "Struggle for life"... but the rest of the album is enriched with a lot of classics from "6", "Fold Es Eg" and from other studio stuff, which are worth checking out.Honestly this hungarian band usually doesn't make such great recordings live, strictly from the point of view concerning the quality of their recording; otherwise you can notice their grandeur right by observing them during their excellent and precise execution as well, in every stage where they play;nevertheless you can understand the great variety and their versatility too, during the proposal of several symphonic compositions!! Of course this is not the best album to start with them, but lives like these get you anyway closer to the neoclassical symphonic genre..

Well here you can find another controversial album, not only for the lacking creative hand of Neal Morse, but also because these American guys have already expressed their ability and music "cleverness" as well, during their first years along with the co-founder Neal Morse the same. There are too many different musical directions inside and sometimes quite far away from the mood of the progressive music-genre. For instance a few good tracks such as "On A Perfect Day", "Skeleton's At The Feast" or "Slow Crash Landing Man" are not so bad! All these songs belong to the spirit of the early albums; instead for example the song "Is this love" is a disappointing number and without a precise music direction, but is aligned with their recent works (such as "Octane"), which don' t include neither pop hits nor creative progressive tunes. Perhaps it could be an exception an easy good track like "All That's Left", a normal pop song characterized by an interesting chorus and a good arrangement too, but thinking of "With your kiss" I immediately change idea about it, as this latter tune is a very weak music perform and at the end it makes me listen to another kind of modern prog music, like for instance that one incredible inside "Suffocating the Bloom" by Echolyn... it's a question of preferences nowadays, but of course I prefer spending my spare time listening to something odd or intelligent, even though it could be another usual attempt to make a renewal of the classic prog genre...make your own choice as usual!

Wow!!This long suite is an ever-green...even though honestly the second half is a bit uneven, in comparison to the first harmonic solutions of this kind of space rock /progressive music.I have always been appreciating their strange blend of space rock music,combined with some experimental solutions within a sort of progressive jazz, for many years!! Then you can add their clever use of power chords at the guitar and a good taste at the piano as well (listen to track #2 for instance), which complete this great debut album...of course the second half-as already explained to you above- is a bit uneven, but the final output is an unforgettable concept album, based upon 2 long songs and for me that's enough!!Check this remastered version out!!

Their best things had to come afterwards ... anyway this stuff is quite interesting because their sound, 70's proto-prog and psichedelic Pink Floyd like, starts to steer towards a poliphonic style,Echolyn-like,with the interesting interludes of the flute and the acoustic guitars as well (honestly in this album and also in "Remember the colors", this characteristics , apart from their voices' poliphony,just recalled, aren't so evident but there's anyway a certain wind of change). Unfortunately this is the only album mentioned at Amazon.com, but their discography is quite important and They have become prolific in the last years. Their new album, here not mentioned, is probably their best so far and I hope it will be put into the Amazon.com list as soon as possible.

Such a good live record, for a remarkable DVD dated 2003 (the live concert was recorded on 2002). It was an important music event perfomed in Hungary and its peculiarity is the combination of classical music (played by means of a tasteful acoustic guitar) along with different features regarding the old symphonic tracks by Genesis (from "The Lamb.." and "Selling England..." Era of the Seventies). Well Steve Hackett performed all those unforgettable tunes with the support of interesting keyboards by Roger King...especially some important composers like Vivaldi, Satie or Giuliani are the classical main covers by S. Hackett at his classical guitar; but you cannot forget other modern tunes like "Jacuzzi" or the melodic and commercial composition by GTR....Obviously I prefer his classical approach here (think of the famous tune "Bour&eacute;e" by J.S. Bach), but the relaxing mood is often replaced and you can find this way the aggressive style of his solo albums, in a "hot" dialogue with the careful Hungarian listener. For me the most balanced track is "Ace Of Wands", another ever-green and perhaps one of his best performances ever...but of course you won't forget the fantastic guitar solo within "Firth of Fifth" in the version equal to "Genesis revisited", even though I would have appreciated the execution of an immortal song like "Fountain of Salmacis", whose best arrangement is right inside the previous mentioned "Genesis Revisited". Nevermind, the present DVD could be an important "Testament" regarding the long live career of the famous British guitarist.Recommended!

Well the right rate should be 2 star and 1/2, as this album seems a polished version of some stuff by Spock's Beard and Beatles as well, despite of the start of the album being quite crimsonesque!!MOREOVER IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE AN EASY DERIVATIVE US NEW-PROG BAND,QUITE MAINSTREAM-ORIENTED, APART FROM A FEW INTERESTING MUSIC PASSAGES ... Anyway you find some interesting music passages, but there's a certain discontinuity, sometimes reminding me of the less inspiring albums by Echolyn, such as "Cowboy poems free", more "song" oriented ... the FM rock side is the first strident aspect within their music,in comparison to their attempt of working in progress, but probably They have been driven also by commercial exigencies ... there is not any peek here, but in general it's acceptable,cause anyway the present issue is better than their disappointing second album! The second controversial aspect is that one of a band looking for his definitive way (there's a certain lack of such a precise direction;it will be indeed the main defect of their second album "I move"), without solving such question!!To me this is an interesting but not essential album...

A fresh air into a light jazz by Ritenour, with the support of a great sax and his powerful guitar always present. "Captain finger" is a delicious album (with a pretty cover picture), where you can find him as a guest for Stevie Wonder, even though you can also listen to a lot of guests-musicians from the funky fusion world. Think of tunes like "Margarita", the title track and naturally "Fly by night"- and you can't forget such an easy but impressive ever green bunch of classics!! His approach is direct and above all the Dave Grusin's arrangement within "Sun Song", with his pretty strings, is remarkable. In fact this latter musician makes me think of the tasteful moments inside the US jazz world!! Of course I prefer another kind of fusion, like that unique composed by Pat Metheny, but in this particular case I will make an exception...Four stars is the evaluation, because in the nineties you couldn't find so many memorable jazz tracks- and moreover the present product is enriched by means of an intelligent funky-fusion; even though of course- out of a commercial (but intelligent) jazz-genre- perhaps you erase an half star at least, but it's a minor question after all! The music works well here and for me that's enough!

Well there isn't any great peak in this album, but in the average it's anyway better than &quot;The light&quot;, because the presence of a new keyboards' player (expecially his Hammond organ), his instruments being coupled with the orchestrations by Neal Morse in an excellent and remarkable cocktail of keys, makes the whole album well worth!! &quot;Thoughts&quot; and &quot;The doorway&quot;, expecially the piano-intro, are alone well worth checking out!! The rest is more accessible than &quot;The light&quot; and less prolix too...Highly recommended!! Even if this isn't the best US prog work of the last 20 years (listen for example to Mirthrandyr's &quot;For you the old women&quot; or the whole Yezda Urfa's stuff and you can understand why...)

Well the fantastic INTRO was a promise, but soon there was a controversial question, because some derivative moments Genesis-like and the forced ones in the vein of modern rock style,created some question marks, above all if We make a comparison with another US band- Echolyn - of &quot;Suffocating the Bloom&quot;, performing a great album in the same period!! But the best instrumental breakthrough it's well worth checking out ... if They were less prolix (listen to the last mini-suite &quot;The water/the edge)this album could have been put among the best 20 prog albums ever...instead.Recommended!! But before this listen to &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;

This is their first attempt to turn their style to AOR music, which will be their &quot;sad&quot; achievement in the next &quot;Real to reel&quot;-in comparison to their previous albums, expecially the 1st and the 2nd one ...and partially the present one as well: however this latter is still good despite of the mellow quite banal songs within, such as &quot;Could be this love&quot; and &quot;Can't think twice&quot;, or &quot;Shadows of song&quot;, &quot;Shine on Brightly&quot; and &quot;White wings&quot;, which are in a mellow pomp rock vein... instead &quot;Evening wind&quot; is an ispiring derivative track in the vein of Yes and also ELP oriented; while &quot;Why have they gone&quot; is oriented to their early style and remarkable too, like a sort of a backward step to their past!Still good but not essential (the cover artwork for the cover is much better!!)

The 1st concept album by Camel - &quot;The snow goose&quot; - was a very good release, the 1st important live &quot;On the road&quot; had got an high reputation, but this one it' much better. The live version of &quot;The snow goose&quot; is much more amazing and aggressive (the whole disc 2)and close to perfection as well!! The rest (disc 1) is represented by some classic material from the early Camel (for example Metrognome and 1st light from &quot;Rain dances&quot;, Lunar Sea from &quot;Moonmadness&quot;, Lady Fantasy from &quot;Mirage&quot; and so on) which are performed very well.Higly recommended!

Another must have album, expecially the final suite, which was inspired by Rimsky/Korsakov's original Scheherazade, which is one of the most beautiful prog suites ever, that I will bring to a desert island naturally !!But proceeding by order, the album starts with the remarkable intro at the piano of &quot;TRIP TO THE FAIR&quot;, which is in the vein of the best stuff of classical music;then it continues with the fantastic introduction of the finest femal voice ever (in my opinion) according to the &quot;fairy-tale&quot; romantic style...afterwards a short jazzy/pop solo to conclude the track, before introducing the light and quite easy song &quot;The vultures fly high&quot;,whose melody is captivating, thanks to Annie's magical interpretation ... the same consideration, of course, I have to do for the mythical ballad &quot;Ocean Gipsy&quot;, which moreover adds the final fantastic crescendo, which alone makes this song well worth checking out.Finally I have to describe the emotion and the feelings too, which are brought about the incredible mood of the Title-track SUITE: it's so enriched with beautiful themes and fantastic arrangements, that it's better if you check it out soon!! Nevermind if you are a critic of classical music, because Renaissance have changed the original opera for its major part, making the concept of &quot;1001 nights&quot; from &quot;Arabian nights&quot; more captivating and sensible (always according to my opinion).Highly recommended!! Buy this desert island record and you won't be disappointed...

Actually the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2, because not the whole stuff (apart from &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;)-in my opinion- is equal to the original studio's efforts,the mythical &quot;Running Hard&quot; being another surprising exception (listen to its &quot;a-cappella&quot; break)...probably there was some problem with the mixing and, of course, the formal execution of the songs, characterized here by a polished sound and performance too. Besides the different mixing, in comparison to their studio's efforts, plus the songs arranged in the same way, don't add anything really diverse and better. I would have appreciated a different arrangement of the whole pieces (except on &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;, which must be performed and arranged in the same way, because the originals are perfect in this way!!). Nevermind, this historical document represents their last &quot;memorial&quot;, a golden era for Renaissance ending ...in fact after &quot;A song for all seasons&quot;, still very good (expecially the title track and &quot;Opening out&quot;), They began to change their route radically, towards some pop stuff: in this manner Renaissance won't comeback to their original grandeur anymore... the recent issue, dated 2000, of &quot;Tuscany&quot; partially denies this sentence!!A must have as an historical live document, adding anything new, but nevermind, They are fantastic in any case !!

It's a good album! Such a pity,only, for the failed attempt to rescue the whole US live stuff, which was partially lost and re-recorded in the studio with the help of Eddie Jobson at the violin,in the place of D. Cross. The track &quot;Lament&quot; and &quot;Larks tongue in aspic part II&quot; as well, are the best gems of this album. The remastering makes the original recording improve very much and let appreciate the live version of the famous hits of the Wetton/Bruford ERA, as well !!They were more appreciated in Europe than in USA, but these sessions show a different &quot;welcome&quot; by the american people...as various labels were interested at this project (nevertheless this was the consideration, at least, by some critics in that time): regardless of this consideration and apart also from the stuff re-recorded in the studio-naturally - the usual EG label was busy with the re-issue, some years after, of this important record, which is recommended to the King Crimson's fans, even if it isn't completely essential ...

Finally They have driven their creativity towards something diverse..that is They have looked for a new musical dimension in comparison to their previous works, searching for wrapping atmospheres and maintaining themeselves close to the gothic edge of sound.However They have shown a great taste in the track&quot;Bizzarro Ballo&quot;as well..but to be honest We must forget their first minute of the album, which is forbidden to the person under 18 years..anyway in the prosecution They don't perform too many bombastic solos, even if the rythmical section remains quite complex, showing a certain maturity and giving evidence of an important improvement, also from the point of view of their composition!!.Well to be honest I don't like the gothic and horror sound from the beginning to the end in the vein of Goblin(even if &quot;Bizzarro Ballo&quot; is the first change and important breakthrough as well ),instead I love the changing atmospheres and dynamic sound as well, in the vein of the great ensemble Banco del Mutuo Soccorso - and- according to me- it's better if the band tries to utilise the modern syhnts and technology, in order to make the sound improve, this being less old...Recommended for the lovers of classic 70's prog with gotic sound (not from the beginning to the end), and classics analogic synths/Hammonds from the early 70's, with some rythmical modern samplings (unfortunately, unlike their previous albums, there isn't a bass player here!!)

By focusing on the acoustic stuff by Jethro Tull you need to listen also to the best unplugged material by Ian Anderson in his fine solo albums...here a couple of songs from his solo works are well represented - and of course it could be the controversial aspect of such a self-tribute album concerning J.T. only, talking about their long career ...actually the most orginal song is not a typical J.T. tune, because for me the track dedicated to the famous Isle of Sky in Scotland, entitled "Dun Ringill", was written for the "Stormwatch" album in 1979 (not their most known album) usually not performed live! Moreover the track performed live in Denmark, entitled "Pastime With Good Company", has been already executed by Blackmore's Night in a better manner and such a controversial consideration prevents me to give this "The Best of Acoustic J.T" an high score..nevertheless I like to mention the "poor" tribute to their important folk prog/classic rock album such as "Songs from the wood" and "Minstrel in the Gallery", here represented by a couple of songs only!!Anyway you can add another half star at least

This is such an interesting chamber jazz, fusion-tinged...in fact the orchestrations- by means of the woodwind- are enhanced in a remarkable manner and in particular the job performed by Paul McCandless at the bass clarinet and the horn too! Moreover I've re-discovered such a good Collin Walcott's skill, after his departure from the Oregon ensemble in the course of 1984...after that event the ensemble won't be the same anymore...but coming back to the present issue, despite being not suspenseful (like in a few true progressive works nowadays and something more in the seventies, I mean), it's stunning. Otherwise- actually- the music of Oregon is intelligent fusion and nothing else, but you can find some fine music breaks-through inside and this feature alone could be enough to judge the album as well worth checking out, at least!! At the end nevermind if their music is an hybrid genre, in the middle between the chamber jazz and a kind of world music, cause in its particular style is unique!!So my evaluation is "4 stars" inside a collection of experimental acoustic jazz..."3 stars" in a normal prog collection, especially if this "Out of the woods" is judged by a "prog purist".

Well You can fearlessly skip some material from this quite prolific band without being sorry, because the production isn't always at the top. In the case of this collection, They have selected almost the whole best stuff from a couple of albums and remastered them with a good production. I've seen them live on stage -Near Como Lake - Italy,and I wasn't absolutely disappointed: They demonstrated a great professionality and versatility as well;and by performing a lot of hidden gems and normal musical pieces as well in the last 20 years(anyway well performed and sung too), their collection &quot;The amber/C'est la vie&quot; has soon become a good place in order to know some interesting hidden (I think of a few)songs from UK 80'S new prog. The new World Turtle album, which is the new ensemble created by the guitarist/vocalist Mr McMahon, has some references to the early period by his former band Haze, but it's a bit inferior than the collection at the title.In fact &quot;The amber/C'est la vie&quot; shows a new-prog review of Pallas,the progressive Rush and symphonic style by Pink Floyd as well, according to the personality of Mr Mc Mahon and maintaining a certain taste in the melodies.Instead the early period -unfortunately- is too much linked to the classic rock...Recommended only to the fans of that simple but not banal new progressive wave, which isn't anyway merely derivative...

Sorry but what's all the fuss about it?! Ok, some instrumental passages are well performedand also mixed in a remarkable way; nevertheless the present album is a bit disappointing,lacking of immagination and almost emulating - for instance - the melodies of Peter Gabriel(listen to "Jealousy") or those ones in the vein of Yes (listen to "Hit Me With A Hit")...if youstart listening to the first song of disc 2 you receive the same impression as above,because their poor music ideas reach the sense of tiredness ( like in the second trackof disc 2 entitled "Touch My Heaven")...anyway, except for such major defects , you candiscover a few interesting features within ,regarding the harmony, as this latter is mainlycomposed by Roine Stolte - even though He sometimes plays some passages which couldbe dedicated to King Crimson (his citation regarding "Larks tongue in Aspic" in the tune "TheUnorthodox Dancinglesson" is evident and it's a bit disturbing me, cause the intro of thissong finally seems an original compostion by Roine himself!!...): "Life Will Kill You" is atypical example, but at the end you could prefer the soft and pleasant approach of "ManOf The World" or once again the good job at the keyboards of "Pioneers Of Aviation"(coming back to disc 1), which is worth checking out at least... and then?...Is it enough? I don't know,but at the end you could erase an half star from the total score.

THE FATHERS OF CLASSIC CANTERBURY!!Among Hatfield and the north,Gong, Gilgamesh, etc, They are the most complex, as they succeed in mixing some experimental fusion, art rock and jazz, in a perfect cocktail, without weak moments. This collection is an interesting excerpt from three albums, but personally I don't like such collections! It's a pity to resume their best stuff in a few discs...it should be useful for their fans if they re-issue a remastered version of their debut album, as it's a super-classic from the early Canterbury scene, or make a remastering of something else, like their live performances, previously unreleased.Recommended!!

Reminiscent of another German rock band with a strong progressive attitude (Eloy), sometimes enriched with a few hints of hard rock (fortunately- in a few circumstances only- reminding me of Uriah Heep), the present album is characterized by an Hammond sound, according to the 70's mood, as well as by a classical approach in the vein of Ekseption, like in the symphony # 5 by Bruckner (here also taken from a live act of their own, whose arrangement is particular...) . But the hard rock imprinting, even though not often present here, is a typical "trademark" of this 70's cult band, which never forget the roots of the basic classic rock of that period...In particular the song "'Es farbte Sich Die Wiese Grun'" is the unique example regarding a soft mellotron sound, coupled with the moog in a pop progressive mood, which sounds "strange" in this work.This time We find a different style, in the vein of the romantic songs by Moody Blues and Procol Harum and probably it's the most spontaneous act within "Novalis"...besides in the other songs you can find interesting time changes, the presence of "wah-wah" guitars and various sound effects (in the territory of "space rock"), but it's not their main target (and above all the most natural one) in my opinion...well, if you like the romantic prog sound of the seventies, in a strange mix between Uriah Heep and also a kind of typical space rock genre, you will buy the present album; otherwise you could also evaluate it like a good work of the past, without pretensions; and at the end it could be worth checking out at least, for a 3 stars evaluation..remarkable memory of the seventies, after all!!

By forgetting their best &quot;The myth of the Chrysalides&quot;, whose greatest effort should be appreciated much more through a digitally remastered-version, they naturally have produced a good album!! They are still one of the best prog bands in Italy, their music being characterized, as usual, by their typical romantic/symphonic prog (early Genesis-oriented)and the epic sound of ELP as well ... certainly They have been supporting the headliner &quot;Banco del Mutuo Soccorso&quot; for many years and in several italian gigs too; nevertheless making proselytes such as the excellent &quot;Aufklarung&quot; (listen to &quot;Io e la tempesta&quot;, if you succeed in finding it ...), these latter improving the sound of Ezra Winston in the recent times very well,with a major symphonic impact too !! But talking about this work by E.W., I like to point out the cool airy symphonic breaks through and the sense of melody as well,which enriches the sound, sometimes by means of flutes/horns with a medieval mood !!Moreover the magical interplay between the keyboards and the guitars and the change of dynamics/airy atmospheres too, make this work very interesting!! At last a bonus track &quot;Shades of grey&quot;, a delicate and sweet song, broken by a fine guitar solo in the middle section ...Recommended,expecially if you like the typical atmosphere of romantic prog, but before this one start with &quot;The myth of Chrysalides&quot; !!

Well I don't give it the top score , because a band working for a new exploration of musical languages should be defined as a true "progressive band" if they were able to find a really renewed music path, still nowadays (I think of Echolyn inside "Suffocating the Bloom", for example)...instead the present ensemble -created by Ken Jaquess with the support of Allan Holdsworth (as you know, already guitarist within the first line-up of UK) and Ryo Okumoto (already with Spock's Beard)-by retracing their usual classic stuff is skillful in its emulation regarding the old ideas from bands such as UK and early Genesis, without adding anything new.But this is not a problem for me, because the background of each member is that one of a "classic progressive rock and fusion" band!! Soon you can listen to an epic composition- 25 minutes long-entitled "Infinite Voyage", which is their first chapter:ok it's an important but not completely original suite, as well as a perfect outmoded arrangement, according to the 70's stereotype.Morevoer, as a matter of fact, The Moog and the Hammond organ recall such an old style from the seventies, but I don't want to criticize them absolutely, as unfortunately Shaun Guerin ("Gabrielesque" vocalist) sadly passed away after the recording of this album and in a short time.Therefore it's a concept album about the famous "Book of the Dead", that you can hardly resume in a short music project (total timing: 46:38);while K2 has got such a complex task into focus ( the first chapter only is a little bit prolix) till the end...think for instance of some stunning tracks such as "Aten (Window of Appearences)",where Jaquess and Holdsworth perform a good job together-within a short tune-3 minutes long.Instead probably there is a minor defect inside "The Edge of Light", cause of some repetitive melodic lines,even though Guerin's vocalism, soaring on "Mirror to the Spirits", is always remarkable!! Besides, talking about a few defects inside, Allan Holdsworth is a guest soloist within the whole project, while John Miner has performed the majorioty of the guitar work...so I 'm not happy about it but nevermind,as the present work is excellent!If you regard of the solo-violin within The Edge of Light", in a sort of up-tempo used by a fine instrument like that,especially in the manner of a powerful player (do you remember Eddie Jobson with UK?!) and considering also the effective conclusion of the concept (Chapter 5 : "Cloak of Antiquity),which is never boring or prolix, you are very satisfied at the end!This recent music project doesn't concern the refounding (or temporary reunion) of UK, such a super band,because there is one former member only from its original line-up; and moreover Allan is a guest star here...but at the end-however- the present work is well worth checking out from the beginning to the end!!Try this at home and be happy!!

Well this album-issued on 1995-was the big turn of their career towards a more progressive sound of their own!! That is this was an important concept album for the famous canadian ensemble, based upon an unknown book (to me unknown naturally!) &quot;13 GEN abort retry ignote 63&quot; by Howe and Strauss: the story takes place in the 21th century, within an apocalyptic scene regarding N.Y.C and its new Generation X... Jim Gilmour is involved with the orchestrations on keyboards and the vocals as well,making a great job; while Ian Crichton as usual utilizes a lot of guitars, always put in evidence in a powerful manner -almost in the vein of prog-metal music- in order to let the story become more dramatic and violent...sometimes some orchestral breaks through and a vivid narration as well, also performed by an Android voice and a young child too, make this album very interesting and under a costant high tension!! The main defect of this album is its prolixity and the excessive repetition of the same themes almost all along the story,which at last becomes quite boring. But, apart from this considerations,this is their first attempt to break the schemes, with their purpose to abandon the simple structure of a song and looking forward to emulating the famous rock opera of the seventies!! The great final section of the album is represented by a fantastic modern symphonic stuff, with a stunning crescendo and the final catharsis of the drama.This is the most progressive effort by Saga and it is worth checking out, even though is prolix in some circumstances;but for sure the fans of 70's prog this time have to bestow a &quot;favour&quot; or a chance on this band, often regarded as too much mainstream ...REMARKABLE STUFF!!

Well in coincidence with the recent 35th Anniversary Tour with Yes (his acoustic material has been very well appreciated at Estival Jazz in Lugano on 8 July 2004),this stuff represents the peek of his long career as a musician and composer too!!You can listen to albums like &quot;Quantum&quot; or &quot;Voyagers&quot; and you can find also some old friends once again,like Max Bacon-ex vocalist by GTR- or Annie Haslam from Renaissance (in the track &quot;It's All over Now, Baby Blue&quot;),without thinking of the collaboration with Geoffrey Downes from Asia (in &quot;Just like a woman&quot;).Nevertheless you have to be in the habit with the whole unplugged repertoire by Steve, in order to appreciate his recent production more and more...therefore-talking about his music-you might think that he has never become old,despite of his several vicissitudes also as a member of Asia, Yes or GTR,which could have brought him into the wrong way: instead he has always focused his target on a different role, as his purpose is being a classic guitarist with a fine taste and a good sense of melody as well, which can make you forget a few tiring acoustic breaks-through...to me that's enough and for sure almost the whole collection is well worth checking out at least: recommended!!

Well this is not the best place to introduce the music of this clever duo, which tried to carry on the ideas of the first line-up(originally a TRIO with the presence of Schicke)after the first broke-up of this latter, in a more versatile manner.In fact They usually got their goal to drive their neoclassical and space rock influence, filtered through many other styles, including experimental jazz ... but this live does not include such these elements at all: that is the band doesn't give evidence of its versatility and ability completely,in order to resume all their old styles. To me the production of this live is not perfect; otherwise at the time of such issue(1980),the electronic new wave was the main influence for the music producers within rock music, so that some of the genial elements of their early period have gone away and replaced by a modern approach. Nevermind, the output is anyway good and, even though this live is not essential at all, it can be one of the last examples of their versatility, representing their good music acknowledgement(the next production on studio will be dated 1981, under the title of &quot;Diary&quot;)...but before this one look for the early recordings (and of course those ones with Schicke). Instead I think of a new band which today is resembling sometimes such attempt within prog music: A TRIGGERING MYTH, which doesn't use electronic loops or samplings, but often succeeds in improving their mixture between classic prog and experimental fusion/neoclassical ... well make your choice once again!!

Well this is a "Journey": perhaps their unique strange music path, a mix in the middle between the best Santana and Uriah Heep, to have got a certain attitude for a kind of simple jazz rock and a very personal sound too, also after a repetitive listening to it...ok actually a splitted episode it was, in comparison to the rest of their production. In fact in the early eighties They chose a different music path (when the sound turned to a mainstream classic rock, "reminiscent" of the typical commercial music, regarding a few bands like Boston, Styx and other melodic bands like those ones...). Otherwise, already by means of "Saturday Nite", you get an inkling of their next easy pop rock, which let me stand here a bit perplix, but nevermind...the "polished" production was good (especially regarding of the remastered version) and the clever vocalist Gregg Rolie performed a good job here!!.Ok, his insteresting vocalism was not as much "stunning" as the best vocals inside the most famous hard rock albums and- above all- not reminiscent for instance of Ronnie James Dio or the best Glenn Hughes...,but Gregg could emerge as a very interesting artist anyway, in the international scene!! And talking about another interesting tune- precisely entitled "Anyway"- this latter one is really in the vein of Santana and in general all the tracks are all song-oriented, but never disturbing me so much after all!!Well, I would have appreciated that also the new tracks by Asia (a band supporting the Journey's American Tour very well in 1981), after their reunion with "Phoenix" and "Omega", could be song-oriented, but with the same excellent attitude as within the present "Look Into The Future"; instead it has not happened in the recent times (neither the new songs by Asia have got the same strong impact as in the eighties albums by Journey, despite of the commercial attitude of these latter, that I don't like very much!!). However, at the end, by escluding the easy moments inside (fortunately a few ones), this work probably remains as the best album by Journey, which is worth checking out at least... so take it easy and- perhaps by adding an half star- make your own choice once again!!

Well it's a good debut album, but too much in the vein of Yes: if you listen to other derivative bands such as Myrthrandir, Yezda Urfa, Babylon and Pentwater, you understand the reason of such disappointment, rightly with the present album by Starcastle: They are a perfect clone of the mellow Yes, with some good arrangements in their music potential and a clever team job at the vocals as well ... besides there is also a certain formal perfection, but unlike the other derivative bands that I have mentioned above,here Starcastle doesn't try to make this stuff a bit more personal(such goal was partially achieved within the next album "Fountains of light", even though by means of this latter They also started to steer towards a easier sound -more pomp rock oriented - which otherwise influenced some US pomp bands such as Styx, Zon, the Angel, Prophet,etc.).The music is very pleasant in its simplicity, and the songwriting good ... nevertheless there isn't an improvement from the point of view of their composition.Instead for instance an american obscure band of the late seventies, Surprise, took inspiration from the mellow side of Yes, sometimes reaching their achievement: They had a special purpose, that is They tried to go beyond the vocal-harmonies and the typical Yes-like romantic melodies, by creating something more personal and less standard. Naturally the band Surprise too was inferior than the the other US derivative bands mentioned above, but anyway They were more interesting than Starcastle ...Recommended, but not completely essential !! Make your choice !!

Well probably this is their most progressive effort so far and I can't remember, apart from some interesting stuff by Djam Karet, anything like this...but there is no vocal part-the album being entirely instrumental - and perhaps the puzzle would be completed better with a vocalist suitable for this modern heavy art rock ensemble. Sometimes there is some fusion excursus, where Damon Che reminds us of the best work by Billy Cobham and Tony Williams with the Mahavishnu Orchestra, but this kind of style is filtered here through the special guitar effects and a certain "Crimson mood". Unfortunately They have recently broken their musical adventure, as for the usual problems with the majority of the mass medias; these latter have been forgetting the alternative musical movements for years, with a certain sense of snob and "tough" face as well. I think of Don Cabbalero's effort and - as a logic consequence of their busy work- They couldn't "survive" for a long time, because They have never put the mainstream style in their music, at their own risk!!Higly Recommended, also to the purist of classic prog rock (apart from the extremist of classic prog movement)

Well this album is quite original; and it shows the ability of this mexican band to create a compact group of seven lenghty pieces, by means of bombastic arrangements without excesses. Unlike a lot of monilithic and too much ripetitive symphonic themes by Cast (expecially in the last two albums), They utilise bombastic interplays without loosing their leading musical narration ... &quot;En Busca De Sentido&quot; introduces a lot of interesting soloings, expecially those diverse ones on drums. Moreover the presence of two electric guitars succeeds in diversifying the symphonic arrangements of the keyboards !!They are a bit derivative (their style being ELP and Yes oriented and also in the vein of Genesis' &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; sometimes)nevertheless are worth checking out !!

Actually the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2,because on 1994 this band from Chicago produced a post-rock album, much in the vein of &quot;Future days&quot; by Can, with a range of tepid instruments (of course this is my opinion)such as the Farfisa Organ, a Melodica and then a lot of samplings and programming as well,which are the main defect of the present album, but the ouput was an original work anyway!! Nevertheless the particular mood created by the instrumentals float, expecially if you listen to it in complete darkness, may be an interesting experience. Such Tortoise's post-rock symphony could be either a captivating stuff or an unbearable modern one, by which naturally you can appreciate or hate their music...naturally it depends on our tastes; otherwise I prefer the best music for example by Don Caballero, another band from Chicago, because They don't explore these &quot;dangerous&quot; music fields like DUB music...Moreover a few extra re-recorded bass lines, along with other - a bit sloppy-rhythms, make the majority of this album most accessible and interesting in the same time, among the whole collection of their modern post rock.But unfortunately the presence of these samplings, sometimes falling into DUB music, will be the main defect of their next disappointing releases!! However, unlike Don Caballero, the absence of convincing vocals can be a problem at last(the unique track with vocals &quot;Night air&quot; is disappointing, as the vocals are not bearable), while D.C. never sing within their compositions ...Recommended but not essential post-rock work, because in my opinion bands such as the kraut space rock band Can, or the modern alternative band Don Caballero, are much better !!Make your own choice!!

Well I'm sorry to give a low votation to this interesting work, because it has been influencing some swedish bands for some years, since its first issue, having a strong impact still today... the problem is only with the sound and the harmonic solutions as well, which are too much derivative, resembling the style of "RED" by King Crimson a bit too much. This swedish band has polished the original "crimson sound" by means of a powerful guitar and a fascinating cello as well...moreover a monumental mellotron and the aggressive Rickenbacker bass complete this dark picture.Besides the tonal dissonance, as a contrast between the melodic lines and the complex harmonic solution of the cello, are quite impressive: the tracks "The old man&the; sea" and "Where the solitude remains" are characterized by very interesting solos,;instead the vocals on "Flow" aren't always inspired. The rest is quite homogenous,expecially when they develop the music contrasts that I have explained to you above, this debut album being quite memorable anyway. I think of a band more mature, when They are able to leave the stereotypes of 70's crimson sound, trying to be more personal (I think of a norwegian experimental folk prog band, "White willow", which sometimes succeeded in doing this...). Nevermind, this debut album is recommended, even if it's far away from the grandeur of the best swedish prog band, Anglagard, whose two fantastic albums ("Hybris" and "Epilogue") are the best output of their attempt to get improve the 70's romantic and experimental prog (a re-interpretation of their own, concerning bands such as Cathedral-US '70, Yes, King Crimson, early Genesis and ELP, but in a personal north european manner), filtered through their dark nordic "fairy-tale style". I haven't heard any following disc by Anekdoten, but some fanzines have reviewed such these publications in the same way... as for this reason I don't think of Anekdoten changing radically their style in the future..however they are among the best scandinavian bands of the last ten years ("Dice", "Anglagard" and - in some music passages - also "WHITE WILLOW" and the underrated "Sinkadus", though, are better in my opinion)Highly recommended to Crimson's fans, talking about the era of "RED", otherwise you can choose along some alternative bands ...

3RD ISSUE BROUGHT ABOUT A FEW FURTHER CLARIFICATIONS:Another excellent concept album, a classic for all seasons!!TO ME THIS WORK IS FUNDAMENTAL, DESPITE OF BELONGING TO THE UNDERRATED PROG ACTS OF THE LATE 70's in UK: OF COURSE IT'S SIMPLE IN COMPARISON FOR INSTANCE TO SUCH NEOCLASSICAL/EXP.SYMPHONIC STUFF WHICH IS MORE AMBITIOUS, NEVERTHELESS "AERIE FARIE NONSENSE" IS MUCH INFLUENTIAL AND ABOVE ALL FOR THIS REASON,LIKE THEIR FIRST PROG ACT "IN THE REGION OF SUMMER STARS", IS WORTH 5 STARS!!BESIDES AS I TOLD YOU IN MY PREVIOUS REVIEW ALWAYS REGARDING OF THIS LATTER- THAT I PUT IN EVIDENCE AS ONE OF THE BEST DEBUT ALBUMS OF THE WHOLE PROG SCENE - ALSO THE PRESENT SECOND ATTEMPT FITS INTO SUCH CATEGORY ONCE AGAIN,UNLIKE THEIR 1ST ALBUM "THE ENID",WHICH INSTEAD DOESN'T FIT ANYWAY INTO IT...THEN MAKE YOUR INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AS I DON'T LIKE TO AFFECT YOUR OWN OPINION!!Talking about this new concept,the music narration is based upon the story of Roland The Knight: the "incipit" of such narration is represented by a short prelude, leading soon to a sweet romantic composition with a mellow fiction tone, in the vein of such 50's Hollywood movies: the title is "Mayday Galliard" and fits quite well into this particular music genre:"orchestral romantic rock for movie soundtracks"...instead "Ondine" is the unique combination of baroque and medieval influences as well, not in the complex manner of Gentle Giant (anyway talking about these latter sometimes such complexity can result boring)and never annoying the listener !! The 17 minutes suite "LOVE-DEATH THE IMMOLATION OF FAND" is my favourite track and one of the best compositions ever by The Enid(great arrangements, beautiful themes and also some sinister moments, which are memorable and impressive too)..however also in their most typical classic rock stuff (listen for instance to "Childe Roland) you find always powerful guitar lines, then supported by the symphonic keyboards of Godfrey,characterized by a certain measure and balance as well!!Another classic that I recommend... even though many critics did not put the first prog act and also the following present album by The Enid among the prog giant's best albums!!

Well, by comparing such a diverse effort by Per Nilsson (in the place of R. Stolte at the electric guitars) with Kaipa, to their three first works, you have to remark a substantial difference...first of all the performance by Mr Per is just a little bit weaker, above all talking about his music ideas; then the vocals as well the lyrics inside are not convincing at all, despite of the support by Fredrik Lindqvist (regarding of the record effects within). In fact I can't think of the uneven performance by Patrik Lundstrom at the vocals (already with the band Ritual) as the main part of the whole album, even though for a moment I forget it when for instance the guest Lindqvist plays the flute inside "The Glorious Silence Within". Therefore this latter song gives the album a different touch, but it seems to be the only remarkable episode from the beginning to the end..don't get me wrong, in order to break the derivative aspects of Kaipa 70's progressive music They has just introduced a few much more modern episodes, such as those ones in the vein of Liquid Tension Experiment for example, which can be appreciated by a wider crowd of metal prog fans (I think of the Dream Theatre fans), but I don't believe it' s enough. Except on a few breaks-through within "Path of Humbleness" and also talking about the performance by Aleena Gibson at the vocals, the other tracks are too much uneven to make the present issue an essential number...so if you're not strictly a big fan of Kaipa for sure you won't buy "A.F.", otherwise it could be an important occasion to re-discover the old albums by the swedish classic prog rock ensemble.Make your own choice!!

Well, of course it was not equal to the best works by a small bunch of very interesting fusion bands in the seventies (Mahavishnu Orchestra, Return to Forever or- once again the immortal Weather Report, for instance, just to mention a few ones), but this "Strange new..." is quite worth checking out nowadays!First of all the style regarding the electric guitar often inspired some important guitarists, such as J. Beck for example; but also the melodic lines were quite important for a few British hard rock bands in the vein of Rainbow and R. Blackmore in general, talking about their vocalism.Even though the present album was not defined at all, as it was a kind of "hybrid work", being a little bit distant from their jazz rock work entitled "War Dance"; and after all the "progressive blues" within the small jewel by Colosseum I ("Valentine suite") couldn't be emulated by Colosseum II. Nevertheless this debut new line-up, including Jon Hiseman, Gary Moore and Don Airey, was able to give the British Hard Rock a major importance or, if you prefer, a kind of improvement (an attempt, I mean...cause the album was not always inspiring) and that's enough to evaluate their effort as an interesting number to be remembered!I don't think of their predominant blues/hard rock influences, sometimes resembling the common places of the seventies, but above all of their intelligent use concerning the Solina string synth and the solos at the acoustic piano as well, a sort of gift to Tony Banks, connected to a few classical textures, sometimes replaced by distorted tones, which became a "trademark" by Gary Moore, along with a certain emotional feeling in the vocal parts.After all, the features described above are so important when you evaluate a rock album, as it's quite "hybrid" in comparison to the "70's stereotype of music", but often interesting anyway (note: even though a fan of prog music could turn up his nose)...Make your own choice, as usual!

Well in the late period of 2000/early 2001, there was the pleasant surprise of the new release by Renaissance,...and, of course, I was very glad;talking instead about Annie Haslam's voice, I like to remark that it's still incredible (listen to the 1st track from "Tuscany")..nevertheless I have remarked the fact that Renaissance are not producing the same kind of magical symphonic stuff, like for example "Turn of the Cards" or "Scheherazade", which belong to their golden era!! Well now the sound is modern and pop oriented too, but always with a light symphonic touch of class ... this live is their last witnessing such golden era, in fact you find here some of the unforgottable gems from "Ashes are burning", "Scheherazade" and "Turn of the cards", by giving the priority to the less complex parts ... anyway the output is always good and their passion alone is worth a 4 stars rating !! The last indiscretions through the corridors (I don't think of a mere gossip)tell us about their new definitive split ... well I know that there are some logistic problems connected with the distance between Annie's home (She lives in the USA) and that one of the drummer and the keyboardist as well, these latter still living in the UK.However I think for example of Andy Latimer by Camel, and you know that He had the same problems in the early 90's, as He was obliged to create a new american line up, with the contribution anyway of english session men,old friends and musicians too (such as Colin Bass)... for this reason I hope in Annie's will to re-establish a new american line-up, without any question concerning the logistics or the usual problem with the promotion of such diverse music (naturally in comparison to POP music at this time).But coming back to the present live, the album is essential for all the Renaissance's fans and quite recommended also to all the men with taste !!

This is a sloppy version of such stuff by Jethro Tull, regarding their folk rock period, with a few excursions into the classic hard rock style...&quot;Twelve streets of Cobbled black&quot; is a typical example of this latter,instead &quot;To the stars&quot;, characterized by a tasty piano and a flamboyant finale, is an interesting track, which is closer to some classic prog stuff, if you regard the spirit of a few 70's bands working in progress. But in general this issue is not completely remarkable, as for the presence of some usual riffs and melodies,you can often hear within the classic rock/hard rock UK scene, in the course of the seventies.If you look into the past (a glance into the music of J.Anderson&amp;C. in the early 70's), you should remain quite perplex...probably Glen Cornick made his first attempt to create a band in the vein of Jethro Tull, after leaving them on 1970(actually I don't know whether this was his true intention or not), but the output was not as much solid and worthy as the best stuff by J.Tull!!That is, his true intention was to perform a sort of heavy progressive rock with hints of folk acoustic music ...but you can imagine, regarding the present derivative work, how it was embraced by the whole J.Tull fans, and then rejected!! Instead the lovers of some tunes by Fairport Convention, regarded as quite attractive a few bunches of folk rock produced by Wild Turkey. Moreover the title track was the combination of heavy and acoustic music, which could appeal both to the fans of Fairport Convention and a few lovers of Jethro Tull as well... finally I like to make a particular mention, regarding such a glittering organ and harpsichord too, perfomed within &quot;Gentle Rain&quot;, another piece reminding of some classic 70's proto-prog/classic prog stuff, which is worth checking out at least!!Interesting but absolutely not essential album of the seventies!!

Usually I don't like the 80's UK newprog very much, except on a few albums by IQ and this work by Pendragon too... a promise being, afterwards not maintained !! Apart from the hit single "Higher circle" the rest is excellent, it's a quite personal stuff, characterized by fresh ideas, unfortunately not helped by the production, very weak, whose remastering I'm still waiting for!!"Leviathan" is a stunning and original song; "Black knight" is probably their best; instead "Alaska" is better in the live version of "9.15" LIVE, whose interesting interplay between the guitar and the keyboards, in the 2nd movement, is memorable (however in the present studio album you find Nick Carter at the keyboards, while Clive Nolan plays the keys in the place of him in the live version...). At last a special mention for "Oh Divineo", which is perhaps the best instrumental composed by Nick Barret ...Recommended even if it isn't a masterpiece !!

This is the unique combination of fine orchestrations concerning classical music, with some heavy guitar excursions: nevertheless -of course- there are a lot of master classic italian prog albums better than this one, yet R.D.M. tries to leave a bit the heavy guitar style of their first album,in order to make the keyboards more dominant and suitable to tell you the story about the life of J.S. Bach: while the guitars are a good completion of the full-bodied sound anyway, even though being less important during the short duration of the present album(36 minutes)... I don't like the other albums, characterized by heavy guitar riffs and a few variations (according to me such l.p.'s got the same defects of some 70's italian albums such as &quot;Biglietto per l'Inferno&quot;), but this one is the output of an interesting experiment and idea as well.Essential album, even though inferior to the other italian masterpieces of the same period !!

Well it's their best effort, resembling the early Yes very much, but with a certain personality and attention to their personal arrangements too...nevertheless if I compare this band to other derivative US bands, such as Babylon (these latter are also in the vein of early Genesis), Yezda Urfa,Myrthrandir and in some moments Pentwater as well, Starcastle can not stand in the same place: Even though the atmosphere is romantic and the 10 minute epic track &quot;Fountains&quot; is a typical example of Starcastle intelligent involvement in some Yes-like light symphonic breaks through !! It's powerful and characterized also by strong riffs . Naturally it's not a masterpiece, as for their tribute due to Yes,above all in the chorus section with their classic vocal-harmonies... nevertheless They grow more and more during the music narration: listen to &quot;Silver winds&quot; and &quot;Diamond songs&quot;, whose melodies are stunning. Moreover the sound of the Moog, a bit Wakeman oriented, is tasteful; while the romantic atmosphere is well supported by the acoustic interludes (listen to &quot;Portraits&quot;) and is worth checking out !!Recommended, even though before this one buy the debut albums by Babylon,Myrthrandir and Yezda Urfa's &quot;Sacred Baboon&quot;

Guy Le Blanc is a tasteful keyboardist, symphonic/fusion canterbury oriented, with a musical touch of his own. For these reasons Andy Latimer chose him for the Rajaz Tour of Camel and the output was excellent... but talking about the present album, it's his last effort, due to the completion of an home recording studio !! This album was at first conceived as a double CD,afterwards Guy decided to expand it to a third album. The concept is inspired by a book concerning the comparison between modern pshycotherapy and the inquisition: it's the idea of Thomas Szasz ... of course a patient affected by a mind's sickness is not an heretic, but his destiny is often similar (talking about his pain), even though He won't be regarded as guilty and sentenced by a trial...this could be the common interpretation of the listener who has already experimented for example some kinds of depression, whenever it seems you have entered a tunnel,by taking a road without exit ... the path to run, towards the recovery, is long and sometimes very hard!But coming back to the music structure of the album, the vocal parts are quite far between and anyway a few ones: certainly I should have appreciated this album much more if it were entirely instrumental, nevertheless the keyboards playing is excellent and often fusion Canterbury oriented (I like his analogic synths, instead I don't get crazy for the Hammond sound in the first cut, but nevermind!!). The second cut, expecially during the istrumental intro at the analogic keys and the epilogue as well, characterized by a baroque armony, are the complementary section of the more accessible songs by Guy Le Blanc. Such Baroque armony reminds me of the work of K. Minnear with Gentle Giant, in the splendid album &quot;The Power and the glory&quot;; instead the modern sound reminds me of the 80's Crimson style, just a bit ...recommended for the lovers of intelligent keyboards, regarding also of the fusion Canterbury/symphonic sound (in the vein for example of sweden Isildurs Bane, even though less complex); but also the melodic lines of bass guitar and the guitar parts too, are not bad !!

Well, it's not difficult to understand that after this work, where Banco was fully involved in the difficult task to split themelselves from their prog style regarding the first three albums, They immediately after dedicated themselves to make a "renewal" of the old sound, but without forgetting their prog roots...and naturally the music, despite being less inspiring in comparison to their best progressive works (think of their concept album "Darwin" for example...), was fully expressed anyway in this melodic "Come in...", above all as it was focused on vocals and their classic influence as well!!In fact no one can deny there was a new change, especially concerning the "artistic" direction (talking about their compositions as well), which will bring a pop mood in the eighties; nevertheless They were still able- after the present album- to compose some very interesting instrumental works, before their definitive commercial or mainstream choice...so "Come in..." is an important step of the band's career, even though you won't find any ever-green or classic hits here, those are the "immortal" songs I mean, that still today They keep on playing live on stage!!...Nevermind, cause something important has been left to their prog fans, who will avoid the commercial hits of the eighties (a-la "Moby Dick", I mean...) but will keep on collecting their intelligent works, like the present one!!After all it's worth checking out, at least!

Well the atmospheric soundscapes of this album contrast the presence of distorted guitars, even though here you find some repetitive themes and a certain lack of a precise direction ... for this reason to me it's a backwards step, in comparison for instance to the splendid &quot;Devouring&quot;;nevertheless the solid drumming and the excellent bass guitar work as well, along with the intensity of their performance in general, make this album quite captivating!! However &quot;Feast of Ashes&quot; and &quot;Ten Days to the Sand&quot; are the best tracks of the album. In particular the guitar solos, always soaring, and also the varied mood of such ambient atmosphere, make the compositions of Djam Karet a good modern art rock stuff, which is worth checking out!!

This work is a good example of the early 70's UK proto-prog (Moody Blues, Spring and Cressida oriented), with a soft symphonic mellow touch. There are interesting and simple songs here, such as &quot;April 73&quot;, &quot;You are&quot; and other sad songs like &quot;A prayer&quot;; moreover you find here the best and most progressive song, the title-track, which is divided into two parts, by adding the mellow sound, the classic organ and real fine strings ... well I don't like this genre very much (actually I don't like the majority of the bands whose sound is too much Moody Blues and Barclay James Harvest oriented !!), nevertheless I recognise a certain taste within these simple compositions, making this album quite interesting ...

Well I've seen this female japanese keyboard oriented TRIO in a prog gig in Milan- Italy- and They were quite impressive. First of all, I had the impression to be in front of a derivative band in the vein of Balletto di Bronzo, Le Orme, Goblin and Emerson Lake and Palmer, in a gothic cocktail, lacking of originality...then, step by step, They began to grow from the point of view of their creativity; at last I remarked their first personal imprinting and I apreciated a song from their new album Android Domina &quot;Bizzarro Ballo&quot;, very original and finally diverse...anyway coming back to the present CD, I must admit that They have made an improvement, talking about the composition, perhaps better projected in the album &quot;The book of dead&quot;; here you can notice some musical common places once again, and I'm usually disappointed about this...Anyway They are quite impressive and technical musicians as well, in order to make us apreciate their bombastic ELP style and...well if you like this kind of style, this CD is strongly recommended, otherwise you can stay far away from this...

The modern new progressive wave (or "crossover prog"- as you often call it) sometimes is characterized by strange compromises...like their use of melodic but too much predictable dark lines (a bit easy in some circumstances), even though enriched by means of a good vocalism.Well actually such vocalism, along with three different strong voices, is partially ruined by the recording (the sound is too much compressed and the mix is not perfect, also regarding of the bass guitar!!); and moreover They never forget the modern exigencies of the modern market, almost forcing them to lose their precise music direction!! Besides the final track "Within Cold Glass", featuring Steve Rothery on guitar, could make us change idea about it, as perhaps you find a leading guitar here, but it's not their usual mood."Awakening" has got a standard sound, standing in the middle between a typical n.w.p. music genre and the crossover genre, but a better production could have improved this tune. Instead that unique style by "The Reasoning" could meet your taste, despite of finding a song like "Playing The Game", with its sensible rhytmical section (do you remember the bass guitar within the ensemble of "Magenta"?) and a fairly good piano as well...nevertheless their production is not so modern (in the true meaning of this word, that is in the technological and polished manner, for example in the vein of a Terry Brown' sound engineering I mean!!...), so that is becoming a defect after a repetitive listen. However their typical rock is always present in the other songs, without any surprise, and They don't grow on me, also by recognizing their split from the commercial sound of the UK, which let us hope for their better music productions in the future!You can add an half star, at the end!!

The feeling at the first listen is that of a &quot;deja-vous&quot;, in fact the album is performed with a quite formal execution despite of a very good tecnique, but nothing sounds original. The melodies of the flute, expecially in those quite moments of classical music, are very catchy but the sense of boring is hidden behind the corner...I listened to them at Prog Fest in Vigevano 1998, receiving a good impression, but I think of a band that is better live, despite of their several albums.If you like symphonic music at its best creative and experimetal moments, I suggest the After Crying albums to you...instead if you prefer symphonic music in a more melodic vein I indicate Sagrado's &quot;Farol da Liberdade&quot; or &quot;Grande Espirito&quot;.

This album is characterized by a classic prog mood with a modern touch and some typical melodic prog metal colors too...nevertheless such imprinting is based upon a compact sound all over its duration... well you don't find here particular surprises and perhaps these considerations let me change a bit my opinion and rate too: that is probably the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2. Besides the keyboardplayer maintains his vivid reference to the bombastic style of Emerson, both on his Hammond and the analogic synths as well and this style becomes soon very interesting for the fanatics of Emerson.Usually the production of Magna Carta is taken for granted (regarding several bands in the vein of Dream Theater and Fates Warning)but -unlike such those bands- Cairo has got a certain care for improving the epic atmosphere, by enriching it by means of some growing dynamic sounds and varied interplays between the guitars and the keyboards as well. The unique reproach is about the lack of a diverse and more original direction... nevermind, their best tracks,"Angels and Rage" and "Western Desert", are characterized by a strong impact, which is always melodic prog-metal oriented, and according to the characteristics I have explained to you above;for this reason their 2nd album is well worth checking out (also from the point of view of its quality production)... instead the melodic romantic "Corridors" and the closing track "Valley of the Shadow", combining such melodic structure with tight vocal harmonies, make this one their best l.p. Moreover the costant presence of the Hammond organ, characterized by an "old retro" 70's sound, makes this stuff much closer to classic prog, in comparison to other melodic prog metal bands. There is often a certain thrilling and high tension too.As for the above considerations "Conflict and dreams" is their best one and not too much derivative recording, above all by making a comparison with their previous debut album (too much enriched with Yes-oriented harmonies) and also "Time of Legends",their third issue, which for me is a back-ward step from the point of view of their composition, as They are more concentrated on their bombastic solos !!Make your choice !!

Well the present stuff is not revolutionary at all, but it's interesting anyway!!Naturally I can understand the contradictory evaluation of such "metal" progsters about the present symphonic effort by R.S., as it would be a revisited version of some melodic prog rock albums of the eighties, even though it's enriched by means of an "hot" vocalism by David McBee (do you remember the singer of Symphony X?...); nevertheless there's a lot of acoustic guitar stuff, with melodic themes (listen for instance to the pretty mellotron) sometimes replaced by a few - more `progressive-oriented ' - tracks such as "Hold that Thought" or the funny " UFO/SHADOW Theme" for example, whose mood is total different in comparison to their usual "melodic pop" excursion...of course you can find also some bombastic themes, thanks also to the important contribution of the analogic ( even though a bit "retro'") classic synths like the Hammond, the Moog an so on... you could say that Moody Blues meet IQ (the band of such "new progressive wave" from England I mean), but They have got a certain personality in the recent times and their emulation seldom goes beyond the crazy derivative models of some fans/musicians in love with the classic sound; R.S. have got their inspiration from a particular model of prog rock, but They also run a personal music road (I don't know whether it's a revolutionary road or not, but it's interesting anyway...) and for me it could be enough to make this "Revolution Road" well worth checking out at least!!Forget bands such as Spock's Beard or Flower Kings and try to listen to something new (especially their melodies, being quite lush at least!!)

Actually I have to rate this work 3 stars,1/2 once again, even though their stuff is resolutely inspired by some Rush epic songs,combining several music aspects in the vein of Rush and a few bunches of Marillion tunes at times,which is not very original...nevermind, the track &quot;Mars Direct&quot; is the most inspiring tune,despite of being too much derivative as an instrumental(if you always regard the epic stuff by Rush); instead I don't like the flat vocals by Goldhawk, as usual, but nowadays it's a common defect, among several new-prog bands;however I must admit that the melodies within &quot;Who We are&quot; are quite pretty or captivating, but it's clear to me that I prefer another kind of vocals.At last the output is very good, thanks also to a good bass guitar job, Geddy Lee-like, even though They will do better things in the next recent album &quot;Between Sunlight and shadow&quot;, which is a true promise. After listening to this latter, I hope They will be able to grow from the point of view of their personality, by making something more original and personal too!!Recommended,if you like the epic stuff by Rush, in a modern and sometimes simpler version...in this case you will check it out!

Ok, for a moment I don't think of Spock's Beard, Marillion and Flower Kings and try to analyze strengths and weaknesses of this DVD/CD live, concerning this superband from California...first of all the sound is good, a little be distorted (especially the acoustic parts of the piano by N. Morse, accompanied by his voice, but also some pedal effects, being not always so clear...), but it's well supported by their direct approach and some good, sometimes remarkable, interplays, even though not often different from their style you can regard in their previous experiences along with the bands above...Instead, talking about the video editing and the camera angle, probably the director has not performed his job in the best manner: the camera jumps from an angle to another, trying anyway to take the whole scene on stage with all the members, while the musicians are playing and singing (without forgetting the keyboards) and that's a difficult task!So, for sure it's not simple to direct such a complex performance, especially if the band always has to play their most famous tunes (such performance cannot be so different from a jam to another), but their usual highlights "Duel With The Devil", "All Of The Above" and "Stranger In Your Soul" must be witnessed anyway in the best manner.Unfortunately every new jam is becoming a little bit tiring and quite prolix also in their live version, after a long duration!! They have been playing these tunes for several times; but this important feature could represent their boring side at the end, if They don't add new fresh music ideas to their retro-prog/melodic metal prog...ok the harmony vocals, the guitar effects by Roine Stolte and his solos together with those ones by N. Morse, are quite in the vein of Yes and the early Genesis, often being well done, but at the end their arrangements are quite dated and their suites perhaps too much long and a bit prolix...even though the unedited live performance with Steve Hackett, regarding the immortal Genesis tune "The Giant Hogweed", is a very good performance (the right track for M. Portnoy on drums) and is worth the price of the whole DVD!!Final note: regardless of the defects inside, you could anyway add another half star at least...but I've been honest in my evaluation, whose score is inferior than the majority of the reviews concerning Transatlantic live, also when I consider the CD audio version...

As a prog fan I can say that We are lucky if We don't listen to this very light and without ideas pop album. Prog rock (and generally prog music), is REALLY something special. I forgive those who try to catalogue this as a prog album, because it means that for sure they don't know anything about prog music!!Unfortunately John had to compose commercial music to survive and it seems impossible, thinking of his great job with UK and King Crimson. Instead We are lucky if We are still listening to his last issue live with a prog band (The Steve HACKETT band, in the amazing &quot;Tokyo Tapes&quot;)

Well in my opinion this is the best effort by Glass Hammer so far...usually their compositions within their previous albums are stunning as well as discontinuos too. This is the work of their maturity, almost perfect from the beginning to the end, even though They don't reach the versatility and peak of creativity as well, regarding bands such as for example After Crying or Isildurs Bane; nevertheless their epic excursions are quite powerful, being above all easy to assimilate and accessible too, in comparison to such best neoclassical symphonic and experimental progressive genre that I have already mentioned to you...instead this new issue by Glass Hammer is in the vein of epic progressive classics, more ELP like or YES oriented.Highly recommended anyway!!

Don Caballero can rule once again!! They are the masters of US alternative rock nowadays, sometimes in the vein of Djam Karet, but unlike such californian modern art rock band, the present band from Chicago is not ambient music-like...well through the corridors,within the Progressive ring,there's a strange rumor about their definitive break-up, but it could be simply a meditative pause and for this reason I don't think They won't be able to comeback. Anyway, coming back to the present issue, in my opinion the track &quot;In the Absence of Strong Evidence to the Contrary&quot; and &quot;One May Step Out of the Way of the Charging Bull&quot; are the highlights of the album, in some circumstances along with Room Temperature Suite&quot; and &quot;Delivering the Groceries at 138 Beats per Minute&quot;, which are original pieces of alternative rock... sometimes their music is hypnotic, tinged with odd colours given by repetitive and syncopated rhytms, over some strange avant-garde melodies (naturally there are not vocals, but their music make emerge such sense of melody). In other moments They build weird harmonies, but not in the manner of such RIO music or according the experimental mood by Henry Cow, for example...remaining anyway in the middle between the experimental chaos of this latter and a genuine and exposed sense of order, even though They stand up with their proud among the best modern alternative bands and a few other art rock bands, whose music is dignified enough!!Recommended to the fans of modern art rock!!

This re-recording and re-remix concerning the famous theatrical dark project of Hammill,which has been the main reference for a lot of dark prog bands, including Devil's Doll, is the best effort by this versatile UK artist in the recent times...the plot is based upon a famous tale by E.Allan Poe, featuring also Lene Lovich as Madeline Usher: the development of this theatrical act is well constructed !! This great vocalist has a strong expression during his vocal excursions, as long as the plot lay-out is completed by the original tale's development of the characters. It's difficult to compare this work to those ones of V.D.G.G., but in my opinion this is the peek of his career and also a true Hammil trademark !! It is very confortable for him,by standing here as a one man band,regarding of his total personal control over the construction of the opera ...moreover by demonstrating also his maturity in this fresh remake! I hope such re-make and the re-recording as well of the whole opera,keep on maintaining the original mood as a secure reference for the next thatrical music acts ...Highly recommended, not for the fans of V.D.G.G. only !!

The best example concerning the chamber orchestra format starts here !!Of course I prefer the symphonic version of "Struggle for life" in the album "6" (see my review here at Amazon); nevertheless the originality and versatility as well of this incredible hungarian band never stop getting their fans involved also within the performance live, once more!! Well unlike the weak recording of the album "Struggle for life" (even though with the presence of John Wetton, performing together "Starless"), the present version inside "Bootleg Symphony" is very original, being supported here by suitable good vocals ... the perfomance live in Budapest by After Crying, in this chamber orchestra format, is anyway memorable, expecially the original version of "The arrival of Manticore", a clear reference to Emerson,but filtered through the typical taste and creativity by this hungarian ensemble!!If you appreciate the versatility within "6" album (even though their recording lives at this moment, except on this one,usually are not equal to those ones performed at the studio's), you can't not remain without this version containing almost the whole same tracks of "6", but in a different format !!

Finally a prog/fusion/canterbury symphonic band, with a great taste and an excellent skill in the execution as well, will lead all the fans of PROGRESSIVE music to paradise!! It's a fantastic suite (43 minutes of breathtaking performance) rich with a lot of colours, full dynamic scales and also a complex armony, which it's a perfect synthesis of the best contamination between symphonic music and the experimental fusion in the last 30 years (including the best experimental bands of Canterbury music and also the best german space rock bands). In all these music styles you can use the word &quot;progressive&quot; to describe the best &quot;work in progress&quot;, corresponding to a splendid world of exploration (you can imagine a performance with among the others Frank Zappa, After Crying, Hatfield and the north, Isildurs Bane, Yes, and so on, in the same stage)Well I wish you a good listen!

Mainly based upon an American Journey's Tour (culminating into a couple of concerts in Houston and Cleveland) supporting the hit album "Escape" on 1981, you can find some other sessions within a 4 months effort at MTV, inside the present DVD live (dated 2005). But of course their main show- taken on November 6, 1981 and featuring the most famous line up with Neal Schon, Steve Perry, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory and Steve Smith- is not always on the most inspiring side of AOR rock. Nevertheless there are always their biggest hit singles...even though- apart from the passion and strong vocal interpretation as well by S. Perry- I'm a little bit disturbed when I listen to a kind of "boogie rock" entitled "Line of fire" and sometimes tired too, owing to their usual ballads, such as "Lights", "Stay Awhile", and "Open Arms".Anyway- fortunately- "Mother/Father" is one of the most "convincing" and heavier songs from "Escape", and above all it's not a commercial hit!! Then I like the guitar solo by N. Schon within "Who's Crying Now", this latter being a ballad in the opening section, but growing by means of the emotional feeling expressed in the guitar line of the following section...at the end I wait for "Wheel In The Sky", probably the best example regarding the style of the guitarist; nevertheless the easy melodic soloings by Neal have been often appreciated also in the pop hits. Moreover I like to mention the excellent production quality (if you consider the record dated 1981!!), with the support of MTV, performing a very good job here- as long as you find an additional song, "The Party's Over" , combined with the Escape TV Promo (this latter enriched by means of the interviews) , which all together make this product of "AOR" music quite an important event. In fact They were able to witness the most melodic moments, according to the typical mood of the early eighties, in the Golden Age of such an interesting American simple rock (however equal to Styx and Boston, just to mention a couple of bands with the same style within that period...).An interesting film for an easy melodic rock-I mean, from a shrewd ever-green band! You know that I prefer the effective prog music genre, in comparison to the world of prog related or AOR music but- talking about Journey- I recognize their importance inside the world of pop music... at the end- for me- it could be enough to think of giving it over an half star in the evaluation, at least!!

It's a very good stuff!! Well I think of a brilliant and not particular original work, but if you like the Canterbury style mixed with some instrumental passages in a light symphonic vein, then you'll be completely satisfied.There are a couple of sung tracks only, which are little bit weak (it seems that the singer is cold and his voice range isn't extended, anyway He keeps on maintaining a good interpretation, suitable for a fine pop song). The rest of the album is represented by an high quality light symphonic music, that remind me of the Spanish progressive group Gotic in the album "Escenes". In my opinion the best track is: "Breakfast at Tiffany's", a small masterpiece and a tasteful instrumental as well, which can be compared to the best Camel tracks and also to some light symphonic south American bands!!

Somnambulist is a mixture of K.Crimson,heavy classic prog(Yes oriented in some harmonic solutions)and the modern art rock sound,filtered through a few elements of Seattle sound(like Soundgarden)... their debut album was probably their best effort, whose output was a compact sound, King Crimson-like all along its duration !!In this case the production has been improved:First of all the track &quot;In The Mindwarp Pavillion&quot; is the best example of Somnanbulist strong emulation of King Crimson ... after a short dramatic narration you find an intricate riff and some excellent rhytmical patterns with strange time signatures, a great crescendo and stunning instrumental highlights !! The second track &quot;Pathos Of Least Resistance&quot; has got the same typical vocal harmonies such as the best performances by Yes;instead &quot;Destroy She Said&quot; is characterized by such those elements of Seattle sound, I don't like very much, but nevermind cause, after that, you find the track &quot;Infant&quot;( a talented guitar arpeggio based upon a classical model, very tasteful) and the odd &quot;Troy Built Helen&quot; a sort of modern art rock version of &quot;Brandeburg Concerto no3 in G Major&quot; by J.S. Bach!I suggest this album to you if you like the modern art rock stuff, mixed with heavy classic prog, BUT TO ME THE DEBUT ALBUM BY HAMADRYAD,&quot;CONSERVATION OF THE MASS&quot;,BELONGING TO THE SAME GENRE, IS MORE INTERESTING ...WELL MAKE YOUR CHOICE!!

Well the last track &quot;Safe -Canon song&quot; - is excellent and very close to the best Yes stuff, but also the rest is worth checking out!! First of all the song &quot;Hold out your hand&quot; already contains a powerful bass playing, supported by a good church-like organ. Besides the presence of remarkable musicians such as Bruford, Moraz, Mel Collins, then also Jimmi Hastings on flute (listen to his stunning flute solo in the song &quot;You by my side&quot;) make this album by Chris Squire as essential,being worth,as much as the best solo projects by other members from Yes (sometimes by improving such style being also better)...otherwise rightly the track &quot;Silently falling&quot;, a 10 minute epic track, demonstrates such ability of performing a well structured progressive song in the vein of Yes, by adding anyway a different mood, derived from his own music experience(a Squire trademark)and without asking Jon Anderson&amp;C. for giving a better shape to his solo project,except on some Bruford and Moraz sessions!!A must have for Yes-fans !!

Ok, take it as an historical documentary, regarding the first era by Camel (in the sixties, when Peter Bardens settled the roots of melodic prog music) and the second one in the late seventies/early eighties, when the AOR and commercial sound was unfortunately predominant in the production of Andy Latimer & company... well the restoration of the eary nineties (period regarding "Dust and dreams" and that unique era of Harbour Tears, with the exception of "Hopeless Anger" and "Hour candle", where Andy Latimer is fantastic), is not witnessed by any interview or film concert (do you remember the remarkable "Coming of Age" live-album, for instance?) and I don't understand why!! Nevertheless as a tribute to the memory of P. Bardens I'm glad, cause He's worth to be honoured like one of the most important keyboard and Organ player during more of twenty years and "The Snow Goose Era" along with the most successful hits stand still like some of the best prog memories, to be celebrated right now!! At the end "Fox Hill", the most amusing moment of "A Nod and a Wink", with a typical sound of the early Genesis, is very advisable in order to conclude the DVD Tribute in the best manner!!Long Live Camel...but the present documentary (dated 2003) is essential for the fanatics or the long time fans of the band only!

Roger Hodgson alone represented the whole project by Supertramp and still today! In fact the present DVD- featuring a famous concert recorded in Montreal in 2006- is a typical example regarding his unique style and talent as well..the ideas and the melodic impact of his songs are a "Roger Hodgson's trademark"; and moreover his versatility (He plays the keyboards, the 12 Strings Guitar and even the harmonica) makes himself like the "one showman" by Supertramp. So all these features let us choose the present DVD like a must-have within the AOR/pompous melodic music-genre: think of some ever- green tunes like "The Logical Song" or "Long Way Home", without forgetting another remarkable song such as "Dreamer" and you can understand his value as a strong melodic composer!! Naturally I'm a piano player like him and I'm so happy when He plays the Grand Piano or the Electric Piano with the same naturalness; even though I'm in the habit to have my personal benchmark to measure the skill by Roger (that's the Live In Paris by Supertramp) and sometimes it seems lacking his old approach when He's involved with the choice of the songs selection (actually a difficult and embarassing choice it is)...but it's a minor defect after all, like the omission of a full "Fool's Overture, cause He's able to create a great feeling and emotion anyway here...perhaps ever!!

Well the right rate is 3 stars and 1/2, as I prefer the single CD format of Retropolis, which alone contains the whole variety of musical ideas by Stolte ... nevertheless this &quot;Sturdust We are&quot;, even though in the double CD format, is probably their most complete. However talking about its defects, I have to remark the following considerations:First of all &quot;The eyes of the world&quot; is a jazzy ELP oriented piece of classic prog music, dominated by a &quot;RETRO-EPOQUE&quot; old organ , by means also of the rotary effect of the leslie speakers... and this arrangement doesn't contribute to make the sound modern!! Besides the voice of Stolte is much similar to that one of John Wetton,but in the most crepuscolar vein (listen to &quot;Starless&quot; from &quot;RED&quot; by King Crimson, and you understand the reason why...);generally They try to alternate the melancholic atmospheres and those ones typical of their hardest tunes, often skillfully, always thinking of the Camel-like melodic guitar instrumentals (listen to &quot;Ice&quot;, in the album &quot;I can see your house from here&quot; by Camel, and you understand a lot of things !!)..this happens in the track &quot;The man who walked with kings&quot;, whose retro-style of a soft pipe-organ introduces the main section, characterized by a stunning, even though much in the vein of A. Latimer, melodic guitar-solo!! Anyway in my opinion the best track of the album is the mini-suite &quot;Circus Brimstone&quot;, whose profuseness of mellotron, in the chorus section, remind us of &quot;Hybris&quot; by ANGLAGARD,these latter-to me- stand on another planet, that F.K. can't reach ... anyway by prosecuting to listen to this 1st disc till the end, you find the track &quot;Compassion&quot;, the last song of the 1st disc, which is almost Tangerine Dream-oriented, expecially in the last part, where you hear a kind of electronic space rock, quite unusual for them ...The second disc is a bit discontinuos, as from the presence of a couple of commercial tracks, even though in the istrumental &quot;Don of the universe&quot; F.K. try to use a different range of instrumentation such as the sax and the sitar,which make this track more original.Finally-regardless of a couple of forgettable tracks (&quot;Different people and &quot;Ghost of the red clouds&quot;)and some normal songs, I like to talk about the last suite (honestly too much long)-the title track- which is their best effort so far...certainly the duration -25 minutes- doesn't help to maintain our concentration, but the suite grows in dynamics, by means also of the support of the second vocalist (Hans Froberg), whose higher voice contributes to make the repetition of their themese less boring ... moreover the religious and spiritual lyrics are quite interesting !!Recommended, along with &quot;Flower Power&quot; and &quot;Retropolis&quot;, their best albums (even though -unfortunately - their last productions begin to fall into the common places of pshichedelic prog music and metal prog too!!)

Well the right rate should be 4 stars 1/2, as for the presence of a commercial pop song,as a bonus track, entitled &quot;New York&quot; and also a certain F. Di Giacomo's mood,that is a strong emulation of Banco del Mutuo Soccorso !! But apart from these remarks, this album represents the romantic side of classic italian prog of the 70's, magnificently (the debut album by Acqua Fragile could be another example, this one being anyway too much Yes-oriented and less personal, despite of some great moments).The first track &quot;A volte un istante di quiete&quot; is already an important credential concerning this romantic grandeur of L.D.F , with the airy splendid intro at the piano, followed by the epic entering of the guitar, by means of a magical interplay in between, a bit PFM-oriented, but with a L.D.F. sound trademark !! Then there is the title track, with the quite lyrical introduction of Leonardo Sasso and the first emulation of the lightest Banco ... nevertheless the album continues to grow in dynamics, with interesting quite romantic passages suddenly broken by some tasteful symphonic breaks through and a magical interplay between the analogic synths (such as the Mini-moog)and the guitar as well. The music narration is always interesting, by maintaining the tension always quite high and sometimes very epic too; such impact makes this album absolutely essential in every prog collection !!

The right rate for this concept album actually is 3 stars and 1/2, but their best issue "Masque", dated 1982, is not mentioned here at Amazon.com and it's such a pity, because naturally it's better than this one!! Anyway coming back to the present album, I think of a good comeback (it was issued on 1996): the opener "The rose of memory", starting the narration about the life of King Laurin, is a 20 minutes suite, perhaps a bit too much long, but never boring ... such narration is fluent, as there's no rigid separation between a track and another from the point of view of the concept, except on each title;and at the end of every track there's a clear explanation about the story, which makes this album easier to assimilate! It seems a unique suite, enriched with a lot of heterogonous and assorted music colours...actually it isn't, but the heavy approach by Mr Kaufman, the keyboardplayer from Bolzano (SudTirol-near Austria), is very important, even though sometimes is replaced by the creative guitar of C. Senoner, whose main harmonic solutions lead the music narration of the album, almost all along its duration.Of course the presence of a fine flute, which gives a relax mood to the suite that I have explained to you above, is a completely different music approach, nevertheless the final output is good!!Interesting italian concept of the nineties, but their previous album "MASQUE" is better...make your choice!!

Well, you know that usually I don't like the so called "derivative prog bands" (think of Pendragon as Marillion's or Camel's clones since the early eighties, Pentwater as a reply to Yes in late sixties/early seventies, then also these "Triumvirat" in the seventies, a derivative band a-la ELP, whose music fortunately was more focused on their songwriting, despite They reached their peek with "Spartacus" only)...but apart from my introduction above, I think of this "Old Loves..." as a good and more "commercial" album, characterized by a vocalist- Barry Palmer-in a kind of trouble in his role, even though He's well coordinated by J&uuml;rgen Fritz here, true master mind of the band, which brings about a mood a-la Rick Wakeman regarding the melody and a-la K. Emerson (in a more simple way) regarding the harmony, like within "Panic on 5th Avenue"; while for instance "History of Mystery" is a weak episode, reminding me of the atmosphere inside "Love Beach" by ELP, that I don't like very much...and on the same wave there's "I Believe" (the opener), the most commercial track of the present album, which seems to be quite "journeysque" (unfortunately without Steve Perry on vocals); but the lyrics are quite good after all!! Instead the arrangement regarding the ballad ""A Day In the Life" is reminiscent of a mood which was quite typical in late seventies, even though the piano is evolving towards a more original melody at the piano...Then I have some doubts about the lyrics of "A Cold Old Worried Lady", in my opinion not so inspiring (like Palmer's vocals), as well as about the final title track, which is neither powerful nor so epic, but here the vocalist performs a better job- in a soft style- and such feature could be enough to make their work more suitable for the lovers of other different and more simple music genres (actually this German Band never rechead a commercial success, but nevermind...)Interesting product, not their best one in my opinion!

Well this work is not bad,nevertheless by comparing this work to the best stuff-for example- of Anglagard and Dice, Sinkadus'&quot;Cirkus&quot; can not stand in the same place... anyway you find here some interesting ideas, as from the 14 minutes suite &quot;Jag, Anglamarks bane&quot;:the romantic intro, by means of a pretty flute and cello as well, which introduces a more dramatic/epic instrumental section, enriched with a lot of riffs, interesting themes, even if the majority of the track is &quot;organ-driven&quot; and mellotron-oriented(I don't like this approach very much, expecially if We regard this one as a 90's album !!).Besides the emulation of &quot;Tarkus&quot; by ELP,by considering above all the typical Emerson sound at the organ, doesn't add anything new, in order to improve the originality of this work...moreover I don't like the mellow female vocal harmonies, despite of being helped by a stunning choir and, this time, an intelligent use of mellotron!! The best track is &quot;Valkyria&quot;-in my opinion-which maintains a quite personal approach, by means of the mellow mood of their own, soon replaced with more dynamic passages and interesting riffs. At the end there is the most symphonic track of the album &quot;Ulv I faraklader&quot;, where you find also some guitar passages, whose riffs resemble the style of Fripp and King Crimson (how could They avoid to make some citations, at least, concerning such this famous art-rock band?).As for the above considerations, don't believe to be in front of a new, extraordinary prog band!! Nevertheless there are some interesting passages, which can be quite worth checking out !!

Better things had to come afterwards,nevertheless this debut album is not bad ... first of all the excellent female vocal by Sonia Kristina is a true Curved Air trademark and, despite of the bad arrangement of a famous track by Vivaldi, the opening track &quot;It happened Today&quot; already shows the several sides of Curved Air's music!! A mixture of experimental folk music, with the support of a tasteful violin and such an emotional playing !! The best track of the album is the instrumental &quot;Rob one&quot;, a true Darryl Way's imprinting, with a great feeling,under the same characteristics as the best stuff within this debut album...including the already mentioned opener.Not completely essential, but very interesting debut album-folk prog oriented!!

By means of this third album, Curved Air changed direction from the point of view of their composition, starting to be closer to some stuff by Gentle Giant (for instance the track &quot;Over and above&quot;, which reminds me of &quot;Octopus&quot;)...moreover the presence of instruments -such as vibe and xilophone-maintains such influence,clearly visible all along the duration of this album!! Instead the track &quot;Whose shoulder are you looking over anyway&quot; represents the electronic side of the band, with the vocals electronically distorted, by Kristina.. the rest of the album is in the vein of this typical experimental folk by Curved Air, a true trademark!!

Well if you think of the end of a great artist, whose fame with ELP was interrupted by a dramatic accident which occurred to Keith Emerson in the period of "In the Hot seat" (to one of his hands as you know...), you won't believe that Greg has been able to create a new ensemble after a long tormented passage of his career, by touring all over Europe!! Of course the lead guitarist along with him is able to re- arrange "Take a Pebble" in a remarkable manner, even though for instance their version of "Pictures at an Exhibition" doesn't add anything new in comparison to the ELP version of the early nineties...but even Greg is involved into some excursions at the electric guitar and well supported by a good keyboard-player such as David Arch, so at the end- by excluding the tepid ballads like "Farewell to Arms" (except perhaps on the magic atmosphere of "I Believe in Father Christmas") or a useless blues rock entitled "Paper Blood"- the other tracks- also in the present video concert- are quite remarkable! Greg's voice is not bad, being so mature, even though not clear at all in some circumstances, never mind cause I've appreciated the choice of "Karn Evil 9" and also the ever green "21st Century Schizoid Man" so much, after all!!So you'll forgive him as for some missing powerful ballads like "Still you turn me on!" or the solemn and imposing tune "Jerusalem", but his return on stage as a well supported "soloist" of the prog-related genre has been a true surprise during the year 2005, then becoming a fine "confirmation" in the following year, by means of the present live.Very interesting product and almost a must-have (final evaluation: almost "4 stars", cause the tepid ballads prevent me to give this DVD-live a major score).

You know that I can't get crazy for the prog related world of the AOR/melodic and mainstream bands, but sometimes I like to make an exception, regarding of some "strong" live acts, like the present one by Styx...well I think of some new live acts by Asia, but also of the live in Houston by Journey dated 1981, regardless the AOR essence of Kansas in the middle eighties, when They turned from their hard /prog rock albums of the seventies to a more accessible style (like within "In the Spirit of things" for example..); but anyway, coming back to this new ensemble (note: I saw them live on stage in 2005 in Milan, when They supported Kansas in a fine gig and it was a real surprise!!), I think that their performance is always powerful and quite convincing too, above all by means of Greg Burtnick on guitars, as well as of that precious support from Lawrence Gowan, this latter involved in the keyboards (such a good job!!) , who is able to give this new "incarnation" of the band a more personal direction and an important cohesion too, regarding all the members!! Ok sometimes the lyrics are cheesy and their sense of patriotism a bit superficial, but actually We appreciate their sense of humor in any casell!! You can' t hear such a typical Dennis De Young's keyboard and it's not a defect here, cause the final output is diverse in comparison to the early albums by Styx and quite modern too!!4 stars in a collection of AOR live music, three stars inside a collection of easy prog related music, cause it isn't worth as "completely essential", if compared to the best melodic but truly "progressive" live acts such as for instance "Coming of Age" by Camel; but this is the typical doubt regarding all the melodic pop bands "in the edge" and a minor defect after all, because We're talking about such an interesting music anyway!!

Well it's a modern prog work, not as complex as some early works by Yes, nevertheless this album - being animated by the same spirit - is worth checking out !! Here you find some celtic stuff and classic structures too, always enriched with a personal modern style of his own...Ya, Mr Oliver Wakeman begins to create a more personal and mature sound in his scores! Such style is sometimes splitted by his father's music trademark, even though you find some spare traces of the best romantic sound, inspired by &quot;6 wives of Henry VIII&quot;, the most famous solo work by Rick ... well of course it's not the major part of the album, this one being characterized by a jazzy/funky style and some melodic pop/new age as well. The violin of Jo Greenland and also some Tony Dixon's pipes/flutes are the best complementary musical section, suitable for the airy Oliver's keyboards and piano. Talking about the support of Steve Howe on guitar, his music contribution is tasteful and important as usual, on a number of cuts, and I think of an artist who has never left the 70's music territory, by maintaining anyway the same taste (even though He has never been looking for new technology and modern music effects in the last years, as his style is too much connected to the old era, but nevermind!!)The present album is recommended and naturally it's the most complete work among the last 3 albums by Oliver !!

Ok this Modern and "New Age" version of "Tubular Bells" represented a kind of compromise- being obviously not equal to his most famous jewel, but it was so pleasant after all!!Well actually it could have been his first occasion to "update" the style of his album "Incantations" for instance (in a sort of "minimalist-format" but with symphonic elements inside); instead Mike Oldfield kept on using the style of the "New Age music", which could have been also more commercial in comparison to his old works, so the Discographic Label of course preferred this latter choice, above all for the sale reports...but coming back to the present "The songs...", it was in the vein of his previous "Space" and "New Age" works, in the most polished manner, but without the versatility of "Ommadawn" for example (otherwise this latter lacking of the quality compositions which characterized his early albums) as well as his cleverness in the use of the electronic effects, like within the modern "AMAROK"...nevertheless you can find a lot of simple music phrases, floating everything away, both the listener and the soft (but never suspenseful) guitar textures too, which made "The songs of Distant Earth" closer to the normal listener and a bit distant from the intelligent crossover prog genre, still now!It's not completely essential, being anyway worth checking out at least, especially for your pretty and sometimes beautiful moments of "soul tranquillity"...so if you're into this specific sensation, you could either add an half star or definitively refuse it as a boring music product...however, more or less extremist in your music preferences inside the prog world I suppose, make your own choice!!

My favourite albums by Renaissance are &quot;Turn of the cards&quot; and &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, but I regard also &quot;NOVELLA&quot; and &quot;Ashes are burning&quot; as memorable and very close to that grandeur too, !!The start of Novella is simply superb and incredible, as for the fantastic crescendo in dynamics and its musicality too ... the clear voice of Annie and the superb orchestration complete this magical &quot;fairy-tale&quot;...&quot;The second track is a bit inferior, but it could be a right interlude before playing the classic &quot;Midas Man&quot; and the amazing &quot;Captive heart&quot; as well, whose sensibility and romanticism too, make this CD well worth checking out. The last track is a fantastic piece of music-art once again, by means of the support of the other musicians, in a magical progressive interplay, sometimes more jazzy.Despite of a few weak moments, this CD is highly recommended!!

Wake me up when it's over, I should say!!Ok, such retro-prog (old King Crimson and a bit Gentle Giant-like), in the manner of the dark progressive bands from Scandinavia (do you remember White Willow, Anglagard or bands like these ones?), is good from the point of view their skill, but this kind of symphonic mood is not able to be truly desirable in our times!! The title track is too much long (27 minutes long!) and it's not equal to "Supper's Ready" from Genesis for instance...that is I'm bored when I listen to a typical Mellotron or a synthesizer according to such a Keith Emerson's standard mood, in a sort of never-ending emulation, especially all along their main suite; instead I'm satisfied when a find a great versatility (here lacking so much), for example within the well produced and arranged albums belonging to a more versatile ensemble like After Crying (also paying a tribute to the old "dinosaurs" of the seventies, but keeping their unique style anyway)..don't get me wrong, I don't hate the retro-prog style, cause it all depends on the cleverness of the members! The intelligent emulation or the personal music skill are not enough- in my opinion- to guarantee the final result; in fact such features should be enriched by means of a "secure" creativity, while "Wobbler" lack here, in comparison to my personal exigencies as a musician. But if you think of the retro-style by the melodic "Renaissance" or Anglagard (these latter,along with Sinkadus closer to Wobbler, you can understand what I mean...) and- moreover- regarding Frank Zappa and Gerswhin like immortal examples of the symphonic music without a time, can you find this important characteristic inside the album "Hinterland"? I don't think so, but make your own choice as usual- once again!!You could also add an half star, if you're completely into the retro-style without creativity!

Well here you will find good bass-guitar lines, a pretty support of the keyboards and a sitar as well...This album is less clone than their previous ones,early Genesis oriented, and more original as well than the majority of the english new prog of the 80/90's, but by comparing this work to the american prog jewels, like the masterpiece Myrthrandir &quot;For you the old women&quot; and then(even if these following ones are a bit inferior than the Myrthreandir jewel):Pentwater&quot;Out of the abyss&quot;,Yezda Urfa &quot;Sacred Baboon&quot;,the best work by Babylon and Cathedral &quot;Stained Glass stories&quot;, this recent last work by North Star doesn't stand in the same place...however here you will find the mellow parts but also those ones more guitar-driven.It's not a winner for the originality but quite interesting and the cover art as well.

Well I like some of the music projects by Roine Stolte (the most convincing stuff by Kaipa for instance I mean...and a few albums composed by Flower Kings as well);but some other works like the present one are a bit uneven and often without a precise direction!!This is the case of such "The Music That died Alone" (probably that's a prophecy!!): the reason is that I can't stand listening to Roine Stolte after 5 minutes (the same defect you can discover sometimes within the production of Flower Kings or inside some tunes by Kaipa, but in a few circumstances only...). In fact sometimes Stole is a bit "chilly" during his guitar excursions, as long as He becomes quite boring..but never mind, the style is unique and often interesting during his performances, even though it should be time for new experiences-more aligned with a new modern technology and the music of our time as well (listen to the albums "Show" by After Crying or "Suffocating the Bloom" by Echolyn- and you could understand what I mean!!), instead...well for me Roine is too much involved with the music of the seventies-especially the music from Canterbury-but after a while from my first listen I think that I should appreciate a different style, closer for example to the last stuff by Frank Zappa or something more modern... moreover I don't get crazy for the vocals by Roine and Andy Tillison too, but at the end the output is anyway good.Make your own choice!!

This swiss band is not bad...but it's a little bit too much derivative and in the vein of UK 80's new prog.The arrangements are good, expecially the compositions at the guitar by Lele Hoffman, but almost everything seems a deja-vous!!. In my opinion there is another swiss new prog band, Deyss, whose best work&quot;Vision in the dark&quot; is a little bit different in comparison to the Clepsydra's stuff and better as well. In fact Deyss tries to change the sound in the vein of Yes, but maintaining their own personality. Moreover They are quite complex in their suites (what a pity for the vocals!!). Besides the best swiss dark prog band, Island, has issued a splendid album &quot;Pictures&quot;- in the middle between ELP and V.D.G.G. by Hammil- with the cover artwork by the designer for the &quot;Alien&quot; motionpicture, Mr Giger, whose effort is remarkable!!...Circus&quot;Movin on&quot; is another strong classic and a totally different swiss work (without keyboards, but with a lot of sax,), even if it isn't a masterpiece, this being anyway more original than &quot;Fears&quot; by Clepsydra . Apart from all these considerations, Clepsydra are a good band live on stage and They make the audience involved and concentrated on their show, so you can appreciate also their derivative works...Recommended for the lovers of standard UK newprog of the 80's.

Well in my opinion you have to start with "COMING OF AGE" ,containing a selection of must have Camel tracks, and also with the fantastic live version of "The snow Goose", entitled "LIVE RECORD", which sounds much and much better than the studio album.Anyway here, if you skip "City Life" (the unique weak track from "Nude")and accept another version of the usual Lady Fantasy from "Mirage", which has been the song by which Andy has concluded a lot of lives, the rest is excellent stuff, even if They have forgotten here the essential "Beached" and "Docks" from "Nude", "Lunar sea" from "Moonmadness",plus the sweet "Hymn to her" from the normal AOR album"I can see your house from here"...besides of course there isn't the stuff from "Harbour of tears",this CD being not issued yet.Recommended, but start with "COMING OF AGE" and "LIVE RECORD" before this!!

Well talking about the recent departure of Neal Morse from Spock's Beard, I have the occasion to remark how this issue is disappointing,in comparison to their first 2 albums! This l.p. has been recorded before &quot;Snow&quot; and I have to admit that there are not highlights here and you can note also a clear signal of such tiredness and lack of inspiration too ...this unsolved question makes the album quite boring and not much compact as well, from the point of view of its composition ... &quot;At the end of day&quot; starts the album by means of a good choice of the strings (violins and various orchestrations), but in a few passages it becomes discontinuos: the vocals are not so amazing, because the melodic lines are not fresh nor get the listener involved into the concept of the mini-suite ... for this reason the output is a visible prolixity at the end of such suite.Besides the second track doesn't improve all these defects and you have to wait till &quot;Thoughts part 2&quot;, in order to hear the old fine music passages and understand their music talent too, wasted by this american ensemble.Moreover the final track &quot;Great nothing&quot; seems a turn of direction, instead after a few passages it remains aligned to the general golden mean of the whole album. Naturally before this great final section (&quot;Great nothing&quot; seems the right title, suitable to describle the end of their inspiration!!)you can find spare interesting music ideas and stunning music breaks through as well, but at the end of my listen, a sense of incompleteness within this concept remains, as for the discontinuity, almost all along the duration of this music narration!!To me this album is not essential ... but as usual I don't want to affect your opinion: make your choice!!

This innovative band from Birmingham represented one of the best examples concerning the raising of the proto-prog and art rock scene in the late sixties,in the vein of the early King Crimson and regarding also of the experimental side of bands such as East of Eden (listen to &quot;Merkator Projected).Naturally Tea&amp;Symphony, sometimes considered as an obscure cult band,could not think of emulating the successful debut of Fripp&amp;c... anyway They were much closer to classic prog than the majority of the proto-prog bands of the same period. This stuff is one of the most experimental and exoteric as well, in comparison to their contemporary english bands of the late sixties, by using a different set of instruments and interesting vocal harmonies too!! Moreover the odd instrumental combinations and strange dissonances as well, are performed skillfully ...even though not all this stuff will appeal to you. Some obscure tunes and a sort of brainmstorming too, complete this memorable album, which will be an important reference also for bands such as US 70's Cathedral or the european Shylock in the following years...If you are into this crazy treatment of lyrics and music in the same time,typical of some UK 60's proto-prog bands,without remarking their immature arrangement too much, sometimes being a bit raw, you will remain appealed to such stuff. Besides their defined lyrics and good construction of the songs as well, are well worth checking out !!Of course this is not a masterpiece,nevertheless it exercised a strong influence on the 70's classic progressive bands, characterized by some barbered-wire dissonances and a different approach too, in comparison to the usual romantic bands of that period.Recommended as an historical document!!

Perhaps this is their best effort so far...a mature work, whose definition within a &quot;metal progressive genre&quot; is becoming narrow after a repetitive listen!! They are influenced from US Bands like Kansas or Mastermind, but also from the classical excerpts by Jethro Tull (listen to &quot;Counterpoints&quot;)and ELP (listen to &quot;Confessor's Overture&quot;)..a couple of &quot;aggressive&quot; and quite skillful musicians, such Gardner brothers (already famous within our preferred &quot;progressive genre&quot;)... in particular the track &quot;Halluncination Suite Part 1 - Uppers and Downers&quot; is their best instrumental, with good ambient keyboards and a drum solo as well!!At the end I can not recommend this work as an original and particular creative work, but it's a true &quot;Magellan trademark&quot;, that is a typical US Metal Progressive sound, influenced by such symphonic progressive rock in the vein of ELP...make your personal choice!!

Well this band after a few listenings seems to be inferior than the whole 70's italian prog production of BMS,some material from PFM,some by Le Orme, the first album by Locanda delle Fate,some lp's from Area, Arti e Mestieri, and I could keep going on, in order to mention instead the other recent 90's italian gems, like Aufklaurung "Io e la tempesta","The myth of Crisavides" by Ezra Winston,Quasar Lux Symphoniae(the first),Trono dei Ricordi,Deus ex Machina "De Repubblica", the last album by H20 and generally the rest of the italian excellent prog stuff of the 90's (actually not always at the top from the point of view of the production), of which a few only are mentioned here at Amazon. The bands above, usually aren't familiar with the experimental Canterburian stuff (see Henry Cow, Hatfield&the north and in some moments the best works by F.Zappa,Isildurs Bane)because they concentrate usually their efforts on the romantic prog stuff and on the intriguing utilisation of the harmony as well (apart from some excellent jazz classic prog stuff by Area from Milan and Sacka from Turin). P.d.P. are instead quite familiar with the light canterburian stuff...well the production isn't always satisfying but the ideas were quite fresh in 1977 (the technology wasn't enough in order to guarantee the purity and completeness of the sound).So I should give rather 3 stars and an half and perhaps something more if..well it's such a pity that it has not been recorded once again, by utilising the modern technology, anyway this work is well worth checking out (there are a few and unknown canterburian gems in the italian prog scene, so it's better to check this disc)

One of the best albums from Echolyn, not as good as "Suffocating the Bloom", but close to their music edge of the nineties anyway...the unique- minor defect - is due to the fact that is a sort of solo album, mainly from Brett Kull , especially talking about the point of view of his composition... however the psichedelic tunes as well as the immediate avant gard pop songs (sometimes in the vein of "Mei" or also "Cowboy Poems free"), where the virtuosic features are not the main target, don't affect the good output of the album. I should say that's definitively their most original side, even though the whole album is more guitar oriented, by means of 13 short songs..well the lyrics are a little bit melancholy, obviously not sad, but quite reflective and intelligent too; as for all these reasons the present album can be recommended to the old fans and the new listener as well...for instance "Georgia pine" is a quite powerful tune, enriched with a remarkable guitar solo and a good "support" at the Hammond organ too...ok the piano is gentle but not so important within the composition, but nevermind! "Heavy blue miles" for example is a convincing episode along with its interesting changes in the mood or the various accelerated rhtymical patterns as well, without forgetting the chorus inside "The End is Beautiful", another interesting title track and the definitive "trademark" by Echolin...LONG LIVE ECHOLYN!!

Well the present album is not as good as the best works from After Crying for instance (a band with a similar orientation, even though coming from Hungary and being even more versatile than the Argentinian ensemble), but it's anyway very interesting and original too...ok, I don't like the vocalism by Petty Guelache, but it's not their main target: take their experimental side (reminding me of Magma a bit) and that one in the vein of Zappa (mixed all together with King Crimson) and you can understand their personal music path! Eduardo Rogatti at the guitar (with an heavily distorted tone, often replaced by delicate tones) is not so original in his approach, but his support in the economy of the band is important. Otherwise the guitarist is not the main composer here (unlike for instance Mario Neto within Bacamarte); nevertheless you can find some strings and even a tenor sax inside, almost making this work an emulation of the experimental Canterburian albums from the UK, which you can't forget after all, as moreover all these instruments are perfectly "coupled" with the guitar! Despite of finding a few remarkable arrangements here (especially regarding the use of three voices in the vein of Gentle Giant), the output is not convincing me at all, right now. In fact- as you probably already know- I prefer the polyphonic and above all well defined "armonization" of some different voices for example inside the albums "Suffocating the bloom" and "As the world" by Echolyn, being my personal "benchmark"- along with some Gentle Giant and Yes works- before starting to evaluate this specific important aspect within "Anabelas"...and when I listen to the Argentinian BUBU I can't remark such a small defect; but the other features are well defined.At the end the present work is not essential at all, if you have already collected for example the albums by After Crying (or also by Zappa), Echolyn (especially the only mentioned above albums regarding these latter and some Yes albums), Anglagaard (or also King Crimson) and Magma; but if you don't think of the derivative aspects inside their music you could change idea...perhaps there's one star to add in the final evalution!Make your own choice!!

Well I don't wanna give the top score to this concept work- based on Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky- because for me this cast of stars and less famous musicians too, is &quot;underemployed&quot;. Rick Wakeman is a narrator here, nevertheless his son Oliver shows a certain taste and a good tecnique as well, during his solos at the mini-moog and the other analogic synths...instead Clive Nolan keeps on duplicating his own style, typical of bands such as Pendragon, Shadowland and Arena, which are not so much interesting in my opinion! Anyway the cast of vocalists is good and the output is a range of classic rock which is new-progressive wave oriented, but with a modern touch.Diverse new-prog work, not suggested to the lovers of the complex symphonic neoclassic prog genre !!

Ok that's another product regarding the Neo-Prog scene in Poland, always present- especially after so many concerts performed by Collage (the root of Satellite)- and We are talkin' about nothing new I should say, in comparison to the recent productions in the UK signed up by Pendragon and IQ a long time before Satellite...nevertheless, despite of their low budget, the audio and video quality and a good impact live on stage as well, sometimes let me change idea about this Polish ensemble...of course it's not for the cheesy lyrics and the simplistic approach that I'd like to give you a piece of advice about "Evening Dreams", but it's only as I remark- above all- some good instrumental parts (sometimes reminding me of an old Swiss band called Deyss, with their guitar soloings well supported by the keyboards) and even the good skill regarding the drummer, for which the present DVD is worth checking out at least.The track "Evening Games" perhaps is the best episode, even though the song is too long and the use of Mellotron sometimes is able to disturb me just a little bit (moreover, always regarding the approach of this band in search of some typical bombastic solos- it's a sort of emulation of the seventies- "filtered" by means of the Neo Prog experience of the early eighties in the UK, a bit tiring nowadays...).In any case the output live of their stuff is much more interesting here than in their usual performances at the Recording Studios..this is my opinion naturally and at the end your "music tastes" could be different from mine!So make your own choice as usual, but for me the present product is quite essential within a personal Collection of Neo Prog music...in the average.

After a couple of essential live albums such as "A Live Record" and "A coming of Age" (an "Andy Latimer trademark"), you can resume his remarkable career by means of this interesting anthology, whose title is clearly dedicated to their best "Canterburian" album "Moonmadness" and moreover you can look into the choice of a few songs from "The Snow Goose", perhaps the best style of Canterbury if you exclude the albums by Hatfield & The North or Gong - in a more jazzy mood. Anyway I prefer the early works by Camel in comparison to several works by Caravan for instance (even though "In the land of grey and pink" by these latter is good...); nevertheless Latimer has reached his maturity by means of the recent studio albums of the nineties (above all "HARBOUR OF TEARS" and "Dust and Dreams") being aligned with his famous executions on stage ..."The hour candle" for instance is exceptional both in the studio version and in the live work "A coming of age", unlike "Stationary Traveller" or "Ice" within the present anthology (especially in the section regarding the 80's period, being less interesting in comparison to the live format of "Pressure Points")... Anyway, coming back to this "L.S." Anthology, in my opinion Andy was able to communicate better his feelings and his passionate style too in his famous 70's live gigs, rather than in the studio albums of the same period, but it's a minor question.The present collection enriches your data base of melodic prog - also inspiring recent new prog bands from the UK such as Pendragon - and for me that's enough!

Well this is such an important supergroup within the Canterbury scene, performing here some solid compositions and whose effort is characterized also by the come-back and last work as well by Alan Gowen. Richard Sinclair from Hatfield and the north stands up so far at the peek of his career; instead Phil Miller brings his experience with the glorious ensemble of National Health into such work: the output was this album dated 1982, which presents a couple of sung tracks and other interesting songs. This work was the result of the pressure applied by the producer Jean-Pierre Weiller (Europa records): all the tracks are well worth checking out, according to a compact composition which represents their last witnessing the canterburian sound, by these four &quot;prolific&quot; heroes of the UK experimental music scene(it contains 3 compositions by the poor Gowen, who afterwards in a short time was tragically dead ..., 4 tracks by Miller and only 1 by Sinclair,in a very balanced group, with the contribution of drummer Trevor Tomkins).Finally I prefer to let you listen to this album and then make you express your own idea ... in my opinion this is an essential historical document concerning the conclusion of the Canterburian Era, well issued by the Blueprint label!!

Well this work, after continued listening, is resembling the jazz progressive style of Area's &quot;Caution radiation area&quot;, where free jazz meets symphonic prog.Moreover you find the vocals of Alberto Piras from Deus ex Machina,this singer contributing to make it resemble to some Area's stuff once more!!The pyrotechnical vocal performances remind us of the amazing work by Demetrio Stratos (this incredible and unforgettable singer,the greatest in my opinion,can not be emulated anyway!!). Besides there are interesting spare parts at the violin, played by another D.E.M. (Alessandro Bonetti), which make appreciate this modern prog stuff once again...Highly recommended !!

You don't care about the sloppy rhythms and some simple guitar structures too, whenever They succeed in creating something fresh and original; but once again you can like or hate them, and for this reason I can not give my definitive &quot;sentence&quot; about them ...

Well, it's difficult to explain the reason for which I wanna rate &quot;YS&quot; quite lower than the others: but I have seen Gianni Leone in action in several occasions in Italy, during various prog events, thinking of an excellent talented musician, who focalizes his personal work more on the tecnique, but less on the musical taste and I believe that his show is always interesting but lacks of original and fresh ideas. &quot;YS&quot; live is quite better than the studio version, but it's not the combination of more ideas of each member of the group!! That is the music armony and the melodies as well are a trademark of Gianni Leone ONLY. The dark tones of this studio album are those of an horror soundtrack, in the vein of Goblin, plus some bombastic solos which emulate Keith Emersom. Gianni Leone is singing here and I think that He's less talented in this situation! Me too write down some symphonic suites, I'm a keyboard player of an Italian prog band since 1987 and I have seen a lot of prog keyboards players, (for example Gianni and Vittorio Nocenzi from Banco, Premoli from PFM, then the keyboards players from Quasar Lux Symphoniae, Trono dei Ricordi (F. La Muraglia),and son on): the work of these prog bands is much more interesting because the keyboards player concentrate themselves on the musical taste and accept the ideas of the other members of the band!Anyway good listen and try the live version of &quot;YS&quot;, whose title is &quot;Trys&quot;

From 3 to 4 stars (according to the "mood" of the album) I should say - talking about its evaluation- that's the right score, cause the output is a little bit uneven, even though the best guitar style by this former Focus member is often able to emerge...well first of all it stands out alone as a unique "Akkerman's trademark", regarding of the maturity reached here, but it represents also a personal music style of his own!!In particular the track "Streetwalker" and "Crackers" are the best example, but also the other tunes contain some good features, in spite of the light and too much relaxed mood, in comparison to the strong "fusion" experimentations at the guitar of the period...think of the powerful style concerning some other similar guitarists in the seventies (for example Jeff Beck for instance, or G. Moore in the Colosseum II experience).Talking about the defects inside, I don't like the Akkerman music approach, being a little bit "cold" and characterized by a few emotions; nevertheless- despite the dated orchestrations- it's an interesting product, with its typical strengths and weaknesses (as within the best Dutch progressive/fusion albums) and something else, according to the artistic direction I've often seen in the works by Gong (note: such a strange and hybrid music-genre, in the middle between the Canterburian style and a kind of Chamber music, according to the early After Crying, but in an easier version).Anyway this is probably the best album by J. Akkerman and it could be enough to evaluate the present work sometimes as good as the best fusion/Canterburian works outside Holland (especially in the UK)...so make your personal choice!!

This new album is quite tepid and discontinuous too: it's characterized by bad vocal parts (but this was also the main defect of their first issue)and strange guitar distortions, which are difficult to take !! Nevertheless the symphonic breaks through are always interesting, with the imprinting of a clever keyboardist,Paolo Paroni,whose classical music imprinting is a Q.L.S. trademark ... in fact He has been a professional musician for a long time and his experience is always very important within such Q.L.S.issues!! Moreover the female voice by Annalisa Malvasio gets this album more gracious and gentle too... well despite of being not able to achieve the goal of emulating the same artistic quality as into &quot;Abraham&quot;, this new album maintains a certain charm, standing as a dignified work among the best recent italian publications by Aufklarung,Sacka,H20,Il trono dei Ricordi and so on...well make you choice !!

Some photos are ok, but others are a bit glossy...Well the music of Yes it's better than many further words, but if you don't know this living legend of progressive rock, it could be a good place to start and begin to know something about their golden era.

Finally their reunion has come to reality!! The present live witnesses a recent gig in London, where They have performed a lot of classics, as well the most complex stuff, belonging to a golden era. Branton, Hammill, Jackson and Evan are in top form here, but after all they are the authors of immortal dark progressive works such as "Pawn Hearts" or "H to He Who Am The Only One" and their skill live on stage has never been changed! In a few circumstances Peter repeats the same verse, cause He has not been playing his own old songs from the VDGG era for a long long time (except on tracks such as "Man Erg", often played live during his solo performances in the recent gigs...), nevertheless He's still able to run all the colours of their immortal music, as from the most dark and psychedelic tones to the sweetest mood at the piano, like in a kaleidoscopic "music circuit"!! Sometimes their music is too harsh and experimental as well - and for this reason if you're not in a good mood it's better to listen to some easier tracks, but at the end their imprinting is so impressive and able to make some complex passages less harsh...it's essential for the old fans and it could be the best manner to initiate the others to their particular melancholy and dramatic style.

The new line up in the place of that one used on their debut album, includes the keyboardist for BJH Wolstenholme, Maddy Prior (remarkable singer and princess as well!!) and Justine Hayward, who look like the perfect characters for this concept, introducing a fairy-tale land, called &quot;Wendor&quot;, full with magicians, princes and of course witches too.It's a tolkeniesque mood, in the typical fantasy vein: and moreover the instrumental title track is the best example of their strong orchestral arrangements,naturally regarding also of some more rocking classic parts, till the end...in my opinion the mellotron is more suitable than the harmonica, but nevermind, as the fairy-tale works well once again! (in fact it was used as a soundtrack for a norwegian tv serial), expecially if you consider the other instrumental &quot;Ride to the city&quot; and the special song &quot;Like the wind&quot;, where Maddy Prior sings in a remarkable and sensible manner!! Finally &quot;Dawn of a new day&quot; is introduced by a nice prince (Justine Hayward)whose performance is stunning, followed by &quot;Departure from Carthilias&quot; and &quot;Elsethea&quot;, which are the memorable conclusion of a remarkable fantasy album,a proto-prog version of The Enid.Highly recommended,expecially if you prefer the soft romantic symphonic moments in the place of those ones- more complex and epic too- in the vein of bands such as for example Dice (listen to the splendid album &quot;Four riders of the apocalypse&quot;) ...however make your choice, but in my opinion both albums can complete every important prog collection!!

Well, there are a few "oldies" from the classic prog/romantic scene ("Roundabout", "In the Court of the K.C." and "Fanfare for the common man") regarded as a bit "strident" in comparison to some more commercial/pop hit singles - and for this reason only you could erase an half star from my evalution. For instance "Heat of the moment" or "A Ride easy" could make me change idea about the present reunion...but it's a minor question: ok the execution of the above hits (e.g. inside "Heat of the moment", where S. Howe is not completely into the riff and the aggressive guitar sound of his original take dated 1981) and also their difficult intro concerning the progressive tune "Time again" (in this video performance quite stunning anyway, even though performed slowly), let me think that their pop songs have not been played with a great impact after all, but it's not true. I always like John Wetton on vocals, being almost aligned to his glory days and He's also very conscious of his role during his bass-guitar execution in general; then all the musicians play very well!!So all these features don't change my first idea about the reunion, as well as my consequent personal rating.I think of a band with such a great experience, even though the set of keyboards used by Downes is not always suitable for their oldies; therefore Steve Howe sometimes seems to be - just a little bit - a fish out of water (except on his fine Blues Intersection: well actually here I forget how this latter instrumental intermezzo was acclaimed in a controversial or cold manner during their recent concert in Italy - 2007 july, 23 at the gig of Asti Festival - but never mind, cause the enthusiastic acclamation regarding all the other tunes was great!!). Instead coming back to the guitar tracks and analyzing the particular guitar style, the harmonization within "Fanfare for the common man" and "Roundabout" show the top form of the old guitarist. Moreover this video performance, more than within the audio cd, demostrates how Steve is still great and quite funny also when He jumps during his guitar solos.Instead Palmer as usual is a precise drummer and even excellent during his drum solos... you can see his best approach within the classic instrumental track from "Works" by ELP, an ever green!!.At the end forget a few breaks through only, where the whole band is not completely confident: the rythmical aspects I mean, above all where occasionally the timing of Downes keyboards or Steve at his mandolin in the acoustic set are not suitable,especially talking about their syncronization; but it's always a minor question, because the rest of the performance is memorable...Long Live Asia!!

This is not a masterpiece within the new-prog field, nor a fascinating and appealing work ... yet the originality and the great interpretation by the vocalist Geoff Mann as well, make this album a diverse one! Some fans of &quot;rebel&quot;-new prog (Marillion oriented) regarded this album as the first example of punk-prog ... certainly this work is not derivative and expresses a lot of political protest, even though hidden quite well !! The execution is good, apart from some sloppy rythm and a formulaic drumming style too,but the impact is strong and the protest by Geoff is really surprising as well(listen to the &quot;Creepshow&quot;). The instrumental the &quot;Poet sniffs a flower&quot; is quite odd and epic too! The final output is not bad and, naturally, this band since their first approach into the field of UK 80's new-prog, created a very different and much more creative style in the early eighties, than a lot of other merely derivative bands(even though They are not necessarily better !!) Check this album if you like a simple new prog style- enriched with new ideas- and also their live (&quot;Live and let live&quot;), which is interesting ...not essential completely, but nevermind !!

This is the 15th Anniversary for one of my favourite bands (not only within a collection of progressive music!!), which deserve the best recognition above all if you consider their effort to produce by themselves such a stunning live at Sellersville Theatre (Pennsylvania), dated 25 May 2003. Tom Hyatt has joined together the old members of the band here,including eleven titles within around a couple of hours, with four songs from "As the World", other four tracks from "Cowboy poems free", without forgetting one song for each of the remaining three albums (even though "Mei" alone-the recent suite- is 40 minutes long!!), for me essential. Ok- you see- it's a sort of testament live on stage for these clever boys from West point, and probably it's the last occasion to see them played live some great tunes such as "The cheese stands alone", "A little nonsense" or "As the World"...nevertheless their 2nd DVD includes an important variety from their Archive, helped by remarkable films from the Studio and a few interviews as well, which make this DVD very interesting!!The production is not at the top, but their performance witnessed here is excellent and a must have for the lovers of such a modern prog genre, so check it out!!

That's the recording regarding a famous radio concert witnessing the "Power and the Glory" Tour..of course it was one of their best performances live, even though not all the fans agree about the quality of such gig and the performance itself of G.G., which someone doesn't regard as their best example on stage...their approach was easier here, in comparison to the old complex arrangements (according to their previous baroque music and classical structure of the songs). But even though They played in the vein of the traditional rockers here,the present live was not inferior for instance than "Live Playing the Fool" (dated 1976), despite of this latter being a little bit "scholastic" in the execution, also regarding the controversial recording which wasn't so clear...of course a few unforgettable tracks like "Knots" or "The advent of Panurge" (tracks#6 and 7) make us soon forget the defects within this radio performance, which was played with a lot of energy anyway. Unfortunately this time the exaggeration concerning the vocalism (which sometimes seems out of tune) is really able to disturb me just a bit.Nevertheless- however- the instrumental parts were so powerful,even when They played simple energic rock...Nowadays the music witness has been picked up by Echolyn (despite of their new "avant-gard" pop arrangements of these latter, today less baroque) and I should say by the Hungarian After Crying too, especially when They forget an emulating approach in the vein of King Crimson and F. Zappa: well actually all these bands have been often able to maintain the polyphonic complex arrangement,as it's regarded typical for the "G.G trademark", but the British masters of this music genre in the early seventies were the first ones and you cannot underrate this fact...so the producers are always forgiven for the choice of editing a radio concert by means of the "King Biscuit Flower Hour" label,especially considering a lot of "sound" purists all around the Recording Studios often ready to criticize and...nevermind cause at the end you could also add another half star at least!

Well actually the right rate should be 3 stars and 1/2: anyway it's less complete than &quot;Live at the Carnagie Hall&quot;, remaining anyway memorable!! You find a lot improvisations in the classic suite &quot;Ashes are burning&quot;; moreover you can appreciate an old &quot;cut&quot; of Prologue (to me it's not so much essential, but nevermind ...)and almost the whole best stuff from &quot;Turn of the cards&quot;, as usual. Unfortunately &quot;Touching once&quot; and &quot;You&quot; don't add anything new to their classic &quot;song-format&quot;, while I would have appreciated a new version od Scheherazade, here not present and it's a pity !!Recommended to all the Renaissance's fans, but it's not an essential place to start ...

Well honestly it's difficult to rate this recent release by After Crying, because it's completely different in comparison to their previous works;nevertheless this work is &quot;progressive&quot; in the true meaning of the word. You find a lot of experimentations in progress within this album and by means of several genres like electronic music, fusion, industrial, rap and so on... but without forgetting their symphonic roots too!!You have to listen to this modern work a million times before expressing a definitive opinion!! Of course the presence of a new singer, Mr Z&ograve;ltan B&agrave;tky, in the place of G&agrave;bor L&egrave;gr&agrave;di, is the first surprise...nevertheless, despite of such a different new line-up, this new crazy cocktail of modern styles, suitable for a modern soundtrack, is never boring;and for this reason I like to suggest this album to the lovers of intelligent music...probably after a new listen I will change idea, but now I like it, I like it very much!!
