Daniel Day Lewis as a Prague doctor, hoping for a little afternoon pleasure while on a medical trip, hits upon and scores with Juliette Binoche, but drives off, rudely, in his sports car, when his afternoon delight reveals she lives with her mother. End of story, until she shows up at his door in Prague to continue the conversation. Great opening, but soon I couldn't help but wonder why these two oddball Berlin Wall era ambiguous revolutionaries are so madly in love with each other. We are told that repeatedly, and a marriage union locks the deal, but they seem about as chemically inclined towards one another as a bland peanut butter and jelly sandwich; there for the sake of being. But they are, apparently, the Scarlet and Rhett of the fall of The Soviet Empire, helplessly involved in a Cold War deadlock with Russians who are revealed as typically sitting at a long table in a bar, kicking back vodkas, and behaving like Boris and Natasha from The Bullwinkle cartoons. Come on, really? Lena Olin's nude exhibition with a tophat was a pretentious symbol of democratic freedom, and the potboiler romance and revolution is forever on a low simmer, when it needs to be boiling over. If the film would have stopped when Juliette Binoche shows up unexpectedly at Daniel Day Lewis's door, and they made wild rebellious graphic sex defying all conventions for the duration of the film, (no top hats please, that is SO Al Pacino 'Cruising'), this cold war wouldn't have been so frigid.

Lola receives a frantic phone call form her boyfriend. He will be killed by his gangster bosses in twenty minutes if he doesn't come up with one hundred thousand deutsche marks, the amount he lost in a botched money transfer. So Lola runs, literally, into the streets of Germany, hoping to find means to the money in twenty minute's time.Lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend. They need be, to gain our sympathy against the common but evil financier status quo of Europe. Their attempt to beat the clock against an impossible task, is the one and only subject matter of the film. The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.By the time Lola starts out on her third attempt to save the day, (it's the charmer), you might begin to wonder how the film will pull itself out of it's self-imposed infinity, as it flails deep into a hole of pretense tempting filmmaking and already dated Euro-trash musical score. But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale. While we view a detailed visual feast of a gothic German metropolis as backdrop, it is the sight of the shapely, but not particularly athletic Lola running that captures our attention. Indeed, there is a lady or a tiger at the end of this road, or in this case, a pot o' eurodollars or certain death. Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path. So run, Lola, run. You'll shed those few extra pounds yet.

During a snowstorm, eight women are stranded in a French country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch. Slightly bizarre, low-key French film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance. It has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players, a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind. This is as intoxicating as a glass of fine French wine.

One of those films that I always meant to watch and only now, years after the fact, I get around to doing so, and I am a little disappointed. Docudrama about top tobacco corporate vice president who aligns with TV's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to expose tobacco company standards is too narrow-minded in scope to encompass all the havoc the tobacco empire exposes on the world, relying on the sympathetic plight and near ruin of the family man executive whose behavior borders on paranoia and insecurity. Al Pacino as a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer and Russell Crowe as the reluctant crusader executive both seem overdrawn as characters, Pacino in his familiar nervous edgy urban guy persona and Crowe as the weakling confused executive both grow tiresome after a while. Still, the movie moves along briskly and a surreal sequence where a hotel wall becomes an imagined memory invokes the sometimes hopelessness of tobacco addiction. But why does the film feel the need to mercilessly pick on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;'s Mike Wallace? I seem to be missing the inside word here.

Three lesbians walk into a bar ... no, seriously. Like adolescents first discussing sexuality, "Kinsey" is funny. It's dramatic as well, sometimes boldly so, especially a scene where sex researcher Alfred Kinsey's father, (John Lithgow) reveals to his son, (Liam Neeson) the punishment endured as a child for exploring his own sexuality. But mostly "Kinsey", while very serious minded, contains a constant giddiness, like those adolescents determining the rules of pregnancy, and very much in tune to the social taboo of discussing sex openly, especially the generation first exposed to Kinsey's research. It seems everyone in the movie has their moment of 'schtick', as the serious study of the human body's sexual nature begs for a tension relieving laugh. It starts when the newlywed Kinseys turn to a conventional doctor to discuss their physical incompatiblity, and the doctor says to the bride, upon hearing the size of Mr. Kinsey's sexual organ, as if shattering a Norman Rockwell image, "I'm surprised you didn't pass out." It continues in Kinsey's first day teaching his infamous college class on human sexuality, when he begins the lecture by asking the class, what body organ can enlarge itself 100 times it's size?, to which the class uncomfortably squirms in their seats, until he replies, "the pupil". And when conducting sex interviews to make a census of American sexual behavior, an immigrant in broken english reveals he had, "sex with horse", to which the interviewer tries to retain composure and interrogate him further, and the immigrant replies, "No, I had sex with Horace. Horace!" These laughs keep coming as if relieving us of nervous energy before the serious nature of human sexuality is explored. This is still a complicated subject, prone to conservative vs. liberal values, made all too clear when the sex researchers reach a zenith of human data, and are stopped in their tracks by one subject's admission to having sex with hundreds of pre-adolescent boys and girls. Suddenly odd behavior becomes criminal behavior.Kinsey's report on human sexuality was the first American study to confront the subject in a purely scientific level, as opposed to a moral one. The movie biography delivers this history in both an entertaining and informative way. It's a wonderful film. So anyway, three lesbians walk into a bar and there's this kangeroo serving beer ...

Tedious Sherlock Holmes entry that can't be salvaged even with the casting of the best theatrical Holmes and Watson; Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The speeding train makes for a limited cinematic experience, and Bruce's Watson comes off more imbesole than sidekick. The bigger mystery is where the title comes from; although the train travels at night, 'terror' is not the word that comes to mind.

Astonishingly uninteresting. Maybe there's a way to update the 1947 Broderick Crawford political drama based on Robert Penn Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, but this ain't it. A meek attempt to examine totalitarianism when all social and charitable concern is forced under the wing of a governing body, is buried under mounds of verbal mumbo-jumbo that fills in the holes of skittish characters and situations, and sometimes the mumbo-jumbo remains just bewildering; Jude Law, as Penn's right hand man - "When we first met, did you wink?", and Penn's reply, "I don't remember, maybe I just blinked." And maybe the script just stinks. Sean Penn, as a naive turned corrupt southern politician, quickly becomes a parody of the Huey Long-type character he portrays, and strangely, begins to resemble Freddie Krueger from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. This film was cold, detached and irrelevant, like skimming a book as opposed to reading one.

About as much fun as playing with your toy boats in the bathtub. These 19th Century British military seamen seem better suited for Never-Never Land and a bottle of rum, given their ridiculous offensive war strategies of disguising the ship and building dummy ships to fool the enemy. I've had better ideas in 'Stratego'. There's a flogging, a tormented officer, an amputation, sentimental characters getting killed, and a good-hearted commander who will stop at nothing to destroy his Napoleonic archenemy. The only thing missing is a great white whale to smash the whole thing to smithereens. Given the current state of seafaring movies, if this were a ride at Disneyland, it would be the safe, innocuous Dumbo elephant ride.

&quot;Tom Brown's School Days&quot;?, That's junenile fiction. That's a kid running down a merry lane in England with a satchel on his back, right? So wrong. How could this classic piece of little literature have escaped my attention? A stunning book about a boy's life in boarding school in mid 19th Century England, it tells it's adolescence tale with all the discipline of a Cub Scout Manual and whimsy of a comic book. Author Hughes frequently stops the action and intercedes on behalf of himself, commenting on the progress of the story as a teacher might. His defense of boys boxing with hard fists and fractured skulls is so socially incorrect it becomes amusing in it's conviction. Maybe skulls were harder then. A good knock-a-round is good for a boy. But school-yard fights aside, this is an adult piece of classic literature with a deeply moral narrative and a devoted sense of well-being. In it's second century of publication, it is a breath of fresh air.

King Kong is sitting on a cliff, staring out at the sea of humanity, the sunset glistening in his thoughful stare, looking as much a troubled soul as Ghandi contemplating humankind, while his tiny Fay Wray joins him at his side, in what seems a philosophical prayer to all of civilization. It is, at once, both a ridiculous scene and a touching one, a humanizing of the movie's greatest monster that's as homey as Andy Griffith casting a parental gaze over Mayberry while patting Opie on the head.What is missing in Kong's frantic confrontation with man on the streets of New York City, and what made the original 1933 film so horrific, is the panicked animal quality revealed in the eyes of the original Kong, as he searched high and low on the streets of the big city for anything resembling a jungle vine. He was the pet monkey gone violently berserk in a worst case scenario. Here, he's barely more frightening than the average New Yorker late for the subway.So we have a kinder, gentler Kong. The scares are reserved for the striking island scenes during the first half, that serve as a techno-wonder salutation to the fine work of the original film, and arrive, thankfully, after the melodramatic trite, cliched characters, and stale performances of the film's first 40 minutes.But I enjoyed the film as an entertaining tongue-in-cheek homage to early Hollywood and the original monster. The special effects and cinema work are a feast for the eyes. What this docile magilla-gorilla needs is a bad case of rabies.

Maybe it's a case of 'liking this sort of thing', but I found &quot;Adaptation&quot; to be, like the writer and director's &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, just too complicated and silly to be enjoyable, with a plotline running in and out of the lines of ironic boundary. This is even a little less impressive as it concerns the reliable dramatic device of a man and his twin brother, who may or may not be a figment of the other's imagination. Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper offer dynamic performances in the principal leads but it's the increasingly bizarre and emotionless story which gives the thing an impenetrably chilly air.

Much has been said about the resemblance of "Four Brothers", and the old John Wayne film, "The Sons of Katie Elder", but I'm not going to compare the two. I'm not going to say this is the gritty urban version of the mid-'60's shoot-'em-up John Wayne western. I'm not going to say it. THE HELL I'M NOT GOING TO SAY IT! Even the four brothers swagger and demeanor, their sibling regard for one another, and their distinct characters, while poking around dangerous city streets looking for the killer of their adopted mother, suggest the actors studied that classic western intently. Give them cowboy hats, a few cows roaming around, some six-guns at their side, and you have, "The Sons of Katie Elder", in leather and jeans. And that's fine because "Four Brothers" is as entertaining, as wholesome and nobly violent, as the pistol-packing template that inspired it. You come to believe in this brooding male family unit, and the Motown classics soundtrack, and other soul and rock music sprinkled throughout, (apparently Mom was a big Temptations fan), gives the film a cool '70's feel, like The Sons of Katie Elder meets Shaft.

I'm gonna wash this film right out of my mind. It is long and it is dull. Deadly so. There is a scene in the beginning that introduces the character of Bloody Mary that defies all logic of reshooting. Mitzi Gaynor in the lead is a pixie in search of a Gidget movie although her sexy "Wonderful Guy" bit on the beach is one of the film's few redeeming moments. But it just never clicks, like a tired wave lapping against a shore, it goes on and on. When it ended, I felt like I passed an endurance test.

I saw "Rent" on Broadway in 1999. I remember thinking, somewhere into the second act, I'm loving this but there isn't a whole lot going on. "Rent" survives, -flourishes, on it's sweeping strokes of humanity; on it's bohemian urban ragamuffins singing the praises of life while suffering poverty, disease and drug addiction, like poor and junkie graduates from the school of "Fame". Big empty spaces in the musical, like a few bland characterizations, and sometimes tuneless songs, were overlooked due to the genuine portrait of unfortunate, but very much alive, lives in New York City's gutter level Alphabet City.And for awhile it looked as though "Rent", the movie was going to accomplish the same fete. The first half moves at a lively pace, with beautiful people in ragged clothes, struggling for warmth in candlelit urban dwellings, songs pouring out of them as if it was a natural language, and colorful musical crowd scenes. The fiery and passive scene of a unified neighborhood, in chorus, taking a stand against slum lords, is a visual delight. Angel still makes her drop-dead sexy, snaky entrance, and I was about to be content to see "Rent" again realized, if not creatively reborn.But somewhere along the way, the urban twilight-y atomosphere loses its spark. The thin story lines, which once served quite adequately as brush stroke generalizations of the urban poor, take center stage in lieu of the hardcore song of the city, rising up from the very bricks and mortar of Alphabet City. I thought the film was hurt very much by the absence of the schizophrenic bag lady, so evident in the Broadway production, pushing her shopping cart on stage and joining in on the cast's songs. She served as an anchor weight inclusion of unfortunate city dwellers, not all of whom are artistic bohemians. Here, she has a single dramatic scene that segregates her, as if depicting the real urban poor.It was my understanding that Spike Lee was to be the director of the filmed, "Rent", and it would be interesting to see what another artist would have done. Director Chris Columbus extracts dynamic performances from the cast, notably Rosario Dawson, as a sympathetic and gorgeous heroin addicted AIDS victim, but he wastes precious time in many scenes, particularly the culture class gay wedding, that seems to wander in from a production of "Hair", and stays much too long.It's been six years since I saw "Rent" on Broadway, and I still get offers from that theatre for reduced price tickets to a second viewing. I enjoyed "Rent", the movie, but I may finally take the theatre up on its offer, now that I'm reminded of what a great show it was.

Startling and ambitious vintage network TV production from 1966 is a heart-breaking and unrelentlessly tragic drama with Lee J. Cobb in such a supoerb performance, you want to reach out and console the troubled sympathetic character. So downbeat as to be almost dismal, the play succeeds in it's grip on the realities of grief and doom and the undying hope of a better tomorrow. The rest of the cast is equally superb and I loved the fake realism of the CBS cameras taping a obviously theatrical set.

It never phased me, growing up in the '60's watching reruns of TV's original Superman series, to hear that actor George Reeves had long before committed suicide. It made little sense. I knew you couldn't kill Superman.Hollywoodland, a new film attempting to shed light on the controversy surrounding Reeve's death, begs for an answer to the mystery, but comes full circle, like so many traumatized baby boomers, concluding again that you can't kill Superman. It's almost a cynical, Yes Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus, epitaph, where you sit the inner child down and firmly say, "Child, sometimes even Superman has to put the gun to his temple and pull the trigger.". The inner child firmly believes that kryptonite killed George Reeves, while the film asks us to reconsider that maybe George Reeves killed George Reeves. And then again, maybe not.So beyond being a film investigating Reeve's death, it is more intent on bringing closure to legions of baby boomers who have been lugging around the death of Superman in the deep recesses of their minds. A wizened, adult maturity seems to close the film, while a convincing argument on the murder of Reeves would have been preferred. As far as murder mysteries go, there is just not enough here to support a murder and conspiracy. And as little to support a suicide.Reeves, portrayed by Ben Affleck, is revealed as an out of work actor with only a Gone With The Wind screen credit to indicate any pre-history of the character, (I remember seeing Reeves flare up on the screen the first time I saw, Gone With The Wind, - "Hey, it's Superman!"). There is little mention of his life before his near middle-aged character is introduced, no marriages, no relationships, and it's difficult to accept him as the swinging heterosexual bachelor, who never married, that the film portrays. He's sort of just there, as if having just arrived, hanging around Hollywood waiting for a job. Yet still, Affleck's Reeves is convincing and sympathetic, but never truly exposed biographically. The film's flashing back and forth from the not so distant past to the not so distant future, gets a bit 'tennis game' monotonous, and the inclusion of several false leads, that wander down paths of their own, is boggling. But for all it's half-baked wonders, it remains a captivating film, rich in an undisclosed decadence, and always on the verge of revealing the truth behind the death of George Reeves, even as it concludes without truly delivering the goods.The TV show, Superman, and Reeves himself, are seen, and since this film has been released, are acknowledged as second-rate TV, and second rate acting. The actor deeply convinced a generation of children that heroic qualities can exist, and Reeves transformation from earthly Clark Kent to stupendous Superman, was always a skillfull characterization. The show itself, made on a pitiful budget, offered wonderful supporting players, taut exciting scripts, and a sly wink at it's own heroic camp.In Hollywoodland, we reexamine our reaction to the news that Superman, George Reeves, shot himself to death. As the film suggests, sometimes denial is best, and in 'kryptonite', there lies a whole world of answers.

A dazzling array of mega-celebrities in sometimes silent incidental cameo roles make Robert Altman's &quot;The Player&quot; like an autograph fantasy walk down Hollywood Boulevard. Tim Robbins, possibly America's finest actor is extraordinary as a movie executive seeking revenge on an anonymous writer who's sending him threatening postcards. This plotline unfortunately becomes immediately predictable and contrived and Altman's directional tools seem to lay at his side as this formula suspense angle almost overwhelms the sly humor and excitable performances which keeps this constantly amusing film afloat.

This film starts off on the wrong foot and gets worse as it dances along. Amazingly ill-conceived drama gives us the free-wheeling, care-free public image of Bobby Darin in enormity, but offers little insight into the man behind the celebrity, as if Darin's press agent was still working for a dead man. Almost immediately, "Beyond The Sea" ventures into a surreal world, a lot like Roy Scheider talking to his dead Mom in "All That Jazz", and retains that effect, remaining cold and detatched from the subject at hand as a result. The script is almost dismally bad, cutting through glossy Hollywood bio cliches (Mom dies), and weak uninvolving situations, (married to 'Gidget' Sandra Dee with much less adventurous romance than found in a Gidget movie), just so Kevin Spacey as Darin, can sing and dance, neither of which, it seems to me, he does very well, the singing particularly, like your average guy deluded into believing in his vocal prowess due to the echo in the shower stall.Time lines zip by; the Vietnam War, death of Robert Kenndy Jr., a change in popular music's taste, as if rushing us to a big conclusion while John Goodman, as Darin's manager keeps popping his head in doorways, serving as some kind of time signature; "Bobby, you're playing the Copa.", "Bobby, you're nominated for an Oscar.", "Bobby, your toupee needs straightening." It seems Mr. Spacey who also wrote, directed and produced "Beyond The Sea', would be content to scrap the entire bio, and instead put on a Bobby Darin impersonation night club routine. He could sing and dance to his heart's desire, but eventually somebody (young) would come along and do it better. He could then recite the movie's thematic quote, repeated in the film, - "Memories are like moon beams. It's up to you what to do with them." Not very heavy. Right up there with, "loving Bobby Darin means never having to say you're sorry."

Recorded at Bahamas Island studio recording retreat, Compass Point, here is a collection of long versions, never released, and dubs of songs from Grace Jones' albums of the eighties. It's wonderful. Jones always had the benefit of fine studio session players and the musical cast here shines in a dreamy Jamaican soundscape of romantic endless Summers and street-wise smarts. Her voice is sometimes zombie-like frightening as in the ominous cover of Flash and The Pan's &quot;Walking In The Rain&quot;, and sometimes sedate and hypnotic as in her many excursions into sleepy French language back-up vocals (&quot;I've Seen That Face Before&quot;), but it is always expressive and powerful, a perfect niche to the rhythm and flow of the lush, multi-layered music. Joy Division's &quot;She's Lost Control&quot; is turned into a comedic, violent, and deliciously psychotic urban anthem and the whole CD rings with infectious grooves and sing-along charm.

&quot;Love And Theft&quot; is so chock-full of lyrical delights, the vocals barely stop for a breath between beats, and the music becomes almost incidental to the rapid ramblings that are as fine as Dylan's written compositions have ever been. The words collectively sound like one soliloquy set to varying degrees of old time blues and ragtime pop. Where his previous album, &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; came from a man resigned to inevitable mortality, &quot;Love And Theft&quot; is a renewed lease forever indebted to the pusuit of a good smoke, a stiff drink, or those well-deserved divorce papers. The music is sparse and maybe too ordinary but there's a haunting off-key echo from the roller rink organ in the easy-tempo &quot;Bye and Bye&quot;, a musical metaphor of Dylan finally accepted as a mainstream American master. &quot;Sugar Baby&quot; has some precious guitar strums and emotionally cascading musical drama serving as an authoritive anchor to the light and airy tone of the album. It's the vocals though that make &quot;Love And Theft&quot; so magnetizing and personal. Like listening to a dear old friend with a generously blessed gift for gab.

I must admit, somewhere after the 400th page, I was getting mighty impatient for the great whale to rear its ugly head. Majestically descriptive as to give life to planks of wood and historically fascinating, "Moby Dick" is god-like in its ingenius narrative of man and whales and sometimes tiresome in its detailed descriptions of everything under the sun and aboard the whaling vessel, The Pequod. More than being a great book, I came away with a hunger to learn more of its fascinating author who remains a marvel of history and literary wizardry.

You may ask yourself immediately into The Black Dahlia, why you are watching an intense promotional boxing match, that goes on for several minutes, between two L.A. police officers. What does it possibly have to do with the real-life murder of a young Hollywood hopeful in the 1940's? Well, nothing really. The movie is overloaded with information, the least of which is sometimes the murder of Elizabeth Short, whose mutilated body was found like a decrepit piece of sculptured artwork in Los Angeles in 1947. The filmmakers deny it in the bonus features, but it's film noir, with shadowy lighting, intriguing characters, and haunting jazz trumpet score, and on this level, it's an almost restful and enjoyable film to watch, as characters clearly pay homage to the tough talking guys and alluring exotic femme fatales of '40's film noir. It's central theme, however, something concerning Hollywood decadence, gets muddled in what seems a conventional and complicated police story, and the emergence of plot lines that rival the main story. It's pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey resolution is estranged, and it's multi-storylines collide more than they mesh. Director Brian De Palma's Hitchcockian style works well in seperate entities as opposed to the entirety of the film, and the cast, for the most part, are forever inviting you farther into the film with evolving characterizations, even when you can't possibly take on another police bulletin of worthless information. I was never bored for a moment, the film is that sensually stylized, but it is finally grossly unsatisfying, like a Playboy magazine without a centerfold, or indeed, an unsolved murder.

You might ask yourself, somewhere at the half way point of this southern gothic horror flick, exactly what? Oh, right, we're searching for a magic spell, a spell that, ... um, well I can't remember the actual components of the spell, but I think it gives one the ability to raise the dead. There's so much horror cliche here; locked secret attics, harmless and unexpected frights around every corner, that one forgets the point of it all. That point is a padded and complicated twist and turn concerning a health care worker's attempt to determine the cause of an old man's stroke. Maybe he was frightened to near death.So she has this skeleton key that opens every door in this spooky southern mansion but one, she runs frantically down hallways, up and down staircases, awakes to thunder ravaged nights, and well, you know, if she had a candle, it would blow out, if she made a phone call, the line would go dead.Exactly what you're looking for, a good old fashioned horror flick? Well,"The Skeleton Key", for all it's perpetual horror, never delivers the scares. The big fright seems to be around every corner, but it's just another ghost in the mirror. It does become dramatically interesting, the heroine's search through voodoo subculture possesses a spooky charm, and the ending of the film stands tall as a symbol of alternative religious belief, but the bim, bam, boom 'gotcha!' scare is forever elusive.I'll hate myself in the morning for saying so, but Kate Hudson is bland in the lead with a sort of quizzical 'Leave It To Beaver' delivery - "Gee, Dad, I thought all voodoo was the same.". Peter Sarsgaard's lazy eye nonchalance is finally tiring, and John Hurt, as an incapacitated stroke victim, does well enough I suppose. It's Gena Rowlands, the new horror movie queen, as a wicked old southern belle, that wins me over, mopping up the floor with her scene stealing performance, as if hiding evidence of a weak film.

Classic jazz album, with both live and studio tracks, has moments of acid-tinged brilliance among more traditional jam sessions, which are often edited to two seperate tracks, designated parts one and two. A bit annoying, in that what is missing is a mystery, and equally annoying is the abrupt Porky Pig-like 'That's all folks!", ending to most of the studio tracks. When it cooks, the ensemble is a fine unit of fluid improvisational skill, although unfortunately, the CD doesn't credit the musicians, and if you want to know the names of the exceptional pianist and drummer, you won't find it here. There's a handful of unknown improvisational vocal tracks, possibly by Gillespie or Parker themselves, which serve as snappy comedic relief, especially, "Ooh Shoobee Doobee", which is language for lovemeaking.

Buoyant soft indie-rock glides smoothly under the lilting euro-lounge vocals of Dominique Durand, a 90s Claudine Longet-like spoken breath singer. &quot;Apartment Life&quot; sounds like a day in one's apartment staring out the window musing about the cat on the sill and the meaning of life. &quot;Get Out Of The City&quot; is a catchy pop melody hopefully escaping a stillborn psyche and &quot;Back In Our Town&quot; is a haunting three part vocal that adds an ominous tone to this otherwise breezy scene.

What a paradox of a book. Saul Bellow is a Southern American writer who writes a novel which sweeps across the continent of Africa with a main black character who remains a man-servant throughout. A strong-willed white rich American and an African tribesman who carries his water and is somewhat mystical, may be a mysterious tribe's answer to their religious belief in a 'rain king'. In travelling to Africa to create a black right hand man during civil rights era 1950s, Bellow may have written a bigoted book of epic proportions. The story, which veers little farther than what you get when you have an aboriginal African tribe expecting a 'rain king', becomes riveting in a one-dimensional action-like way and the last handfull of pages are masterful strokes of writing which hopefully depict the weakness of racism.

It's a long movie. Longer than say, a plane flight from New York to Chicago, and like the TV button on a plane, I had to divert my attention with the 'pause' button every now and then. Howard Hughes is a fascinating character whose legacy as aviation pioneer, Hollywood mogul, and super industrialist, will be sadly overshadowed in history by his overwhelming compulsive disorder, which led to tendacies of schizophrenia. How we laughed at billionaire Hughes in the '70s, believing every dust mite was out to get him, allegedly handing out millions to total strangers, a billionaire crackpot who we liked to believe was merely eccentric. The film reminds us that his psychological troubles were very real and that he became enslaved to them. The Hollywood and military history here is fascinating, the cast is excellent, and while some aviation scenes are heavily pronounced as digitally remastered (Intentional? Do we have Hughes to thank for the digital revolution?), it possesses a cinematic love of aerial camera work. The DVD extra menu is most generous with many segments including a panel discussion with Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese on obsessive compulsive disorder and a History Channel "Boys Toys" episode on Hughes' contribution to America's technological might.

When this Ron Howard western wasn't strictly formula, it was simply viscious. Beatings, stabbings, ritualistic murders and a constant peril to children give this film a smutty look highlighted by a bound and gagged group of young girls being dragged across the American southwestern desert. Plot contivances pile up as fast as the dead bodies. Just how much could these kidnapped girls be worth that they are guarded by enough gunmen to rob the Wells Fargo bank? The supernatural elements are an excuse for lack of any dramatic depth. This is a 'C-minus' western with a big glossy shine in which the American Indians are not only savage-like bad guys, but they possess evil powers as well. I guess in the mind of these filmmakers, that is an elevated status. Hey kimosabe, find me a John Wayne film quick!

I thought the 19th Century Cockney prostitutes in the Jack The Ripper film, &quot;From Hell&quot; were going to break into a musical number from &quot;Oliver&quot; at any given moment. They were so darn Cockney and seemed forever on the verge of fully realizing their Dickens-like caricatures. They could have belted out &quot;Consider yourself a friend, consider yourself one of the family!&quot;, at the most inappropriate moment, like when Jack slashes them into what could only be described as a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs and I don't believe I would have batted an eye. Just expecting the unexpected. Old Jack's evil legendary status gets a bit tarnished here. It turns out he's a Simon Legree type or something a little more vague, like ancient Druids. I think I get it though. Jack The Ripper didn't kill those prostitutes, society did. I suppose society built The Pyramids and killed John F. Kennedy as well. Ho-hum. The only mystery left is how much time was spent coming up with the wonderfully creative title of this film. Towards the end I thought, &quot;Oh it is a farce! The cast is going to break into a chorus of &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; on a European mountaintop!&quot;, but no, no, forget it Jack, it's Londontown. Big budget sequel minded merry London. I can see it now. Jack is Back! Just when you thought it was safe to parade around old London in a frilly dress.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was originally a dime store novel that was converted into a jewelled movie under the masterful eye of Alfred Hitchcock. Is a younger generation going to fall for what seems now an obvious surprise ending? I saw it for the first time as a kid in the early 70s and I fell for every trick. Scared? Yup!

Despite the popularity and airplay of signature songs, "Walk Away", and "Funk #49", The James Gang never had a hit single and their Greatest Hits album is really 'greatest album tracks'. When guitarist Joe Walsh joined the group around 1970, they became a hugely popular boogie driven hard rock band, steered by Walsh's creative and quick turns on guitar. Some of this is decidedly progressive with heavy accomanying orchestration, (surprise!), and some of it is just meek and slightly bizarre, (Midnight Man), but The Gang were best as a blues influenced power trio. "Bomber", finds Walsh flirting with cloud gazing riffs, razor edge chords and echoey distortion in a 'pass the bong' Zepplin inspired masterwork that defines '70's FM radio.

African rhythms and percussions predominate Laurie Anderson's &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot;, an urban spiritual odyssey through a 'West Side Story'-like cityscape that recalls Brian Eno and David Byrne's &quot;My Life In The Bush of Ghosts&quot;, and Peter Gabriel's (he guests and produces on the album) &quot;Security&quot; as Congo conscious Western music. The African instrumental intro to the opening track, &quot;Sharkey's Day&quot; sounds just like the opening, rallying whistles of street gangs 'The Sharks' and 'The Jets' in the Broadway musical, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and the album seems to use that Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim score as a blueprint for a radical musical concept of city sidewalks and African pathways cutting across the imagination like a shark on the beach. In other words, it's got a great beat, you can slow-dance to it and it's way cool.

As if The Standells, (Dirty Water), in an act of garage rock preservation, were put in a time machine in 1966, to reemerge in 1989, as violent psychopaths brandishing broken beer bottle necks and hyperdermic needles, in an experiment gone horribly wrong. This six song EP from 1989, reissued by Jade Tree Records in 2002, by a Washington DC punk band who must have self destructed by now, is a raw and furious act of defiance and decrepit artistic vision. The lead singer, certainly on the verge of some kind of a breakdown, scowls snotty temperments of advanced teen angst, like trouble in relationships, the trouble being he killed his girlfriend. At least he thinks so in "Shotgun". He notes, "She ain't breathing/She's gotta hole in her head/Where did her eyes go?". Yeah, she's dead. This may be the same girlfriend who in "Circle of Lies", gets under his tight skin with the comment, "I like your friends". Certainly the stuff to drive men into psychopathic rages. Not to condone violence against women, the band goes way out into the left field of sociological mayhem by album's end and self destructs. It's a gallant exit.

This film boasts mostly a social agenda for stiffer laws in our American court system. Our sympathy is placed firmly in the film's grasp by the tragic event that occurs early in the film and we're forced fed a made-for-tv-like topical melodrama, filmed rather unconvincingly with an art house movie glow. Given the unbelievably pat reaction from the court concerning a dangerous felon, the actions of the survivors of a violent crime are justified. It becomes a movie of revenge for psychological survival and rises a bit above the common social platform it springs from. Watching it is like reluctantly attending a funeral. It's discomforting yet demanding of your participation.

Minimal rock with a funk guitar, muffled drum layers, your busy fret working bass, and a beatnik/hippie poet singer, frozen in Lou Reed's New York City, circa 1971, and whose compositions and delivery about life, liberty, and the pursuit of a good soup kitchen, sounds like the derelict who stops you on the street to witness about Jesus, and robs you at knifepoint before the conversation is through. "Hanging Out", ("Hanging out in downtown Manhattan..."), is pure Reed homage, "Devil's In Heat", is a lovable and superficial Halloween treat, ("The devil's in heat, get off the street, don't come out 'till the break of day."), and "Driving Across The Country", offers '70's funk guitar that accelerates and slips like a faulty transmission in a poetry-begging, far-out cross country excursion, ("I saw flowers where I once saw garbage cans."). Bob Sharkey, when not climbing the funky frets, breathes solid blues rock guitar, and frontman, Tom Shaner, reaches a degree of lunatic tenderness in his dumbed down, urban street persona, ("...walked down to Times Square, bought a slice of pizza at a pizza parlor there."). Industrial Tepee bends over backwards kneeling at the church of Talking Heads, while kissing the Manhattan sidewalk Lou Reed spits on, and carves their own primitive signature in a smoke stacked industrial skyline.

You'll be laughing at the wisecrack, deadpan humor between Agnes, (Ashley Judd), a cocaine snorting, booze guzzling bar waitress, living modestly with a hint of homespun ideals in a desert hole called The Rustic Motel, (picture a caricaturized Sheryl Crow with a beer ih her hand), and Peter, (Michael Shannon), a kind and homeless nerd she hooks up with who reveals a frightening smile of demented psychosis when you least want him to. Then you'll laugh, maybe inappropriately, as director William Friedkin turns, what burns steadily in the first half, as a tidy suspence thriller and evocative domestic drama, into a horrific assault on the senses, the way you would nervously laugh at Friedkin's "The Exorcist", when devil child Reagan informed you what your mother was doing in the afterlife. Not much happens in the first half, but danger lurks at every turn, and the involved drama of an abusive ex-husband returning home after a prison sentence, rivals the creeping suspense. "Bug" becomes a deliberately tacky and intellectual B-plus movie depicting helicopters and earthquakes bombarding a small motel (sort of), self inflicted body carvings, a dental root canal administered by the patient, and bedbugs the size of, well, bedbugs. Those nasty little bites can be maddening.It's a nightmarish diversion of fear and paranoia in modern culture. Not quite big enough to rival "The Exorcist", or cheap enough to be what you might expect from a horror film called "Bug". It's somewhere in between, playing out very much like the theatrical psychological drama, "Bug", by Tracey Lettes, it is based on. If the screenplay didn't include high-minded ideals, and topical horrific references, (many may see Iraq in all this), you would indeed have a horror film called "Bug". But when psyched-out bugman, Peter, covered in fresh gaping wounds, and tiny bug bites, screams The Jonestown Massacre was a cover-up administered by governing bodies, you momentarily think seriously about it. The film also offers a gripping performance by Ashley Judd, whose sad weary waitress begs for redemption, as she is surely on her way to meeting up with that big can of Raid.

Maybe all the pieces in this cinematic 'who's the mole?' extravaganza don't add up; any failed police recruit spending a light sentence in prison, should upon release be wearing a T-shirt reading, "I AM A POLICE INFORMANT", but the mere question, "Are you a police informant?", and the answer, "No.", satisfies all suspicion in Martin Scorsese's 2006 Oscar winning Best Picture, "The Departed". Good storytelling and intense suspense, and finally, a rather supreme film, are just slightly riddled by bullet holes of nagging doubt, like the FBI informant spending nearly the entirety of the film comfortably in the trust of street level Mafia type, while accomplishing nothing, an informant who never informs, or double-crosses; a neutered zone, while spending what must be an adulthood in the brotherhood of Scorsese's gangster kingpin, Frank Costello, (Jack Nicholson). But if you can't find the jigsaw puzzle pieces that fall off the table, or get stuck on the implausible factor, like the big booty for these goodfellas; a nuclear detonating device that can find the hairs off a camels hump from an enormous distance, much like Alfred Hitchcock's 'to die for' 'microfilm', ('bricks' of the nuclear device are passed from a car trunk to a briefcase), and the strangely cliched and martyred Catholic Irish cop, and the king mole who apparently never gains anything for all his troubles, save maybe an unmentioned Swiss bank account, and the post-Archie Bunker mentality towards race, and Scorsese's favorite, and finally, ugly image of gunshot dead gangsters, there is Jack Nicholson's character purring god fatherly sweet murmurs of "it's just a movie".

Soon to be married widow falls for a 10 year old boy who claims to be the reincarnation of her deceased husband. Nicole Kidman, looking and behaving a lot like Ellen Burstyn in "The Exorcist", and the kid, pudgy Cameron Bright, are cinema's newest odd couple and given the strange sexual direction this film begins to take, I'm only thankful the two of them didn't end up in a cheap downtown hotel. Whew, darn close though! Loaded with bold symbolism of the concept of birth, the film fights itself, offering a logical if implausible explanation, but holding tightly to a supernatural element that never materializes. Lauren Bacall, looking as always like she'd kill for a cigarette, plays Kidman's gruff mom, and Danny Huston manages an effective jealous rage towards his ten year old rival. It's said to be the kind of movie that causes after-viewing discussion and we agree, because we're wondering if it's not symbolic of Kidman's marriage to Tom Cruise.

The best segments concerned Charles' childhood, sweeping vistas of rural Southern life brushed in the deep color tones only apparent to the young, and "Ray", although still little more than a standard Hollywood bio, escalates dramatically in the first half and sort of surrenders to the rigorous biographical schedule at hand in the second half. The music is superb and the recording sessions and live performances come alive with a fly-on-the-wall authenticity. His heroin addiction though, seemed lacking in true dramatic depth but steeped in nobility as he requests no medicinal help during withdrawl and later we're told, as it is written on the screen, "Ray Charles never did drugs again". It's not enough to say so, the movie could have continued on showing Charles' basking in the reverence finally awarded him and living the drug-free climate he apparently earned. I love Ray Charles though and I very much enjoyed this movie.

Like Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of Led Zepplin suddenly referring to themselves as The Honeydrippers, Guns N' Roses take a punk vacation on &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; covering a bizarre choice of covers that include punk kings The Dead Boys and The Damned, a doo-wop 50s classic, &quot;Since I don't Have You&quot;, and an uncredited murderer Charles Manson song. The album begins with guitarist Slash doing a spaghetti-western guitar bit in the intro of the doo-wop classic and then the music gets very British and very punk with a genuine anti-social anger stemming from god knows where. Spaghetti westerns, punk classics, doo-wop, profane lyrics, England, Charles Manson, put it all together and what do you got? I don't know. But like what Peter Townsend once said, &quot;There's a message in here somewhere.&quot;

Henry James psychological ghost story, "The Turn of the Screw", makes for a dark and glorious, black and white-filmed horror thriller from 1961. Deborah Kerr stars as the governess who becomes convinced her young charges are possessed by evil. Spooky, yet based on hard-earned Freudian fear, the film possesses an eerie old estate, haunted gardens, thunder and lightning ravaged nights, and ghosts so alluring, it seems a waste to write them off as imaginings. James' novella of sexual repression and conflicts between science and religion, is brought to the screen in all it's psychological intelligence while never abandoning it's haunted house appeal. The movie was filmed with subdued shadowing around the edges, giving it a spacious, ghosts-in-the-attic cinematic effect. The screenplay is by William Archibald, who wrote the successful Broadway play this film is based on, and Truman Capote, ( Breakfast at Tiffany's, In Cold Blood). The bad news is the shabby presentation of this classic movie finally available on DVD in 2005. Double sided disc offers both wide-screen and full screen versions, but the sound is terminally television, and the extra feature consists of one, (one!) insulting theatrical trailer which touts the movie as if "It Came From Outer Space". Why not target the movie-loving public, dress the package up with extras and care, and claim this title to be one of the greatest ghost stories ever filmed?

Classic jazz album from 1963 has the distinction of featuring the high wailing trumpeter Bill Chase, who went on to form the rock group, Chase in the 1970's, ("Get It On"), and who died tragically in a plane crash along with several members of his band in 1978. It includes a Chase composition, "Camel Walk", along with several, familiar modern jazz numbers. Pretty standard stuff with by-the-book interpretations.

Small budget 'art film' gets Oscar buzz in this Christopher Guest, (Best of Show, Waiting for Guffman), comedy vehicle with Guest's familiar cast of superficial, comic players including Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, and Parker Posey. It all gets a little too menial for me; the sharp sarcastic and nasty Hollywood characterizations, the light sitcom-y touch, and lack of emotional depth are affronted by Guest's sudden and genuine picture of decadence in the form of Hollywood players falling to the bottom rungs of stardom. Lots of sly little laughs and keen satirical observations on celebs like Regis Philbin, Charlie Rose, and Anna Nicole Smith, but it's still essentially the same movie as Guest's "Waiting For Guffman", which lampooned community theatre. The deleted scenes seem on par to anything in the final cut, and one; Catherine Ohara's response to Oscar mention on a morning news show, is the comedic jewel of the entire package.

Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) sells international weaponry like he's selling used cars. If you don't like the deals from the former Soviet Union's stockpile of arsenal, you may be interested in a huge lot of discontinued assault rifles. How about unused guns and ammo from the U.S.-led aid to the Bosnian War? If you stick a gun in his face, he'll bring the price way down."Lord Of War" is a cynical, yet not heartless and probably accurate portrayal of an American 'secondary market' international weapons dealer. Yuri globe-trots the world scooping up fantastic deals on abandoned and obsolete weaponry and peddles it off to third world countries where demand for blooldshed is high. His biggest competitor, he likes to joke, is The President of The United States.So you get a heavy dose of good-humored anti-war subtleties, with a highly entertaining movie thrown in for good measure. The first person narrative, sometimes spoken directly into the camera, offers an endless stream of topical one-liners. Some work, and some don't - "Buying your first gun is like making love for the first time. You don't know what you're doing, but you know you're having fun." - or something to that effect. You eventually come away with a crash course in international arms dealing, that all the Time magazine issues in the world couldn't offer, sure to make you a more politically conscious observer. Exposure to the horrific results of weaponry in such an entertaining fashion is harsh, humane and like an unexpected needle from a doctor.Like a confident puppateer above the chaotic gunsmoke of war, Nicolas Cage reveals a believable and likable global arms dealer, who could be the same guy you saw selling a hot car radio in an ally. His scenes selling guns are nerve-bending as he makes bold physical and vocal gestures never riling dangerous warlords, while the slightest nervous tick could set off a slaughter. Bridget Moynahan's 'trophy wife' is anything but, an honest and touching portrayal of a rather superficial person coming to terms with her husband's means to wealth. I loved what she said about her failed careers and her stand against Yuri's profession, - "I have been a failed artist and a failed actress. I will not be a failed human being." Eamonn Walker as Liberian dictator Andre Baptiste delivers a suave and vicious characterization as a man who will 'test drive' a new assault rifle by killing someone in the room with it.I went into this film mistakenly thinking it was the upcoming film, "Jarhead". I saw previews for both and confused the titles. A little troubled by my mistake, it was as if someone pointed a gun to my forehead and said, "watch this film instead." I'm sold. Good deal!

Hideo Nakata's ("Ring"), original Japanese version of "Dark Water", is a supernatural suspense drama about a divorced woman and her daughter, who seem to be haunted by the ghost of a dead child in their new apartment. The City of Tokyo, seen from bleak urban landscapes and generic streets and lots, is a lifeless form of steel and concrete, as is their decaying apartment building, nourished only by the cold and discomforting presence of drenching water. It's in puddles in the hallways, dripping from the ceiling, pooling on the building's roof, and gathering in the roof's water silo where the mysterious happenings may be originating. While the rising water lines suggest impending disaster, the horror factor remains lukewarm, and the 'drip-drip-kerplunk' suspense becomes disarming, as the social consciousness of missing and exploited children robs the film of its fright value. It becomes less a ghost story than it does a 'child in peril' safety concern. The conclusion, said to be ambiguous, made perfect sense to me, and it unfolds as if waking in a dry arid land from a horror soaked dream. Hitomi Kuroki brings much conviction to her oppressed single mom character, and her performance keeps the film's floodwaters rising steadily. If only the ghostly factors could have been as convincing.

I was surprised to find the whole Russian Army involved in &quot;Fiddler On The Roof&quot;. Aside from the spirited singing and dancing, the film depicts The Bolshevik Revolution, a Siberian prison camp and generally the whole Russian Army fighting a revolution in expansive production values that at times equal the splendor of such grand movies as &quot;Lawrtence Of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. As the song and dance die down, homeless Jews travel in poor caravans searching for a homeland and the Russian Army fights and falls while revolutionaries gain control over the country. This all makes &quot;If I Were A Rich Man&quot; seem a bit trite in response to the enormous historical changes taking place in the movie. It seems the film should have only suggested these worldly details and remained focused on the gentleness and charm of the lead character and his domestic troubles.

In 1910, a woman and her mother are stranded in the Brazilian desert, and are forced to make a home out of a house, far from modern civilization, which is literally sinking in the sand. Director Andrucha Waddington's allegorical sand swept domestic epic of a woman searching for a home where the heart is, moves through three generations of hardship, lust and love, and the pursuit of a freedom as evident and unreachable as the moon. Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres make a compelling mother and daughter team, (in real life they are indeed mother and daughter), and aside from an unconvincing account of a girl becoming an aimless, boozing flirt, after witnessing a lovemaking session with mommy and stepdad, the film is a beauty, probing gently into one's time and place on our civilized planet.

Word to Julia Roberts - Lose the lips, darling, you look like an aquarium slug trying to escape. Jude Law, dude, you got to work out more, you'll be the first actor to come to mind for a new version of "Gumby". Jude Law has the sexual attention of both Roberts and cute as a vixen on fire with a whip, Natalie Portman, and the geeky nerd chooses the older, stiff as a board Roberts. Dysfunctional? Maybe. Stupid? Absolutely. Clive Owen marries Roberts and after a marital indiscretion, retreats to watch Portman do a slinky striptease pole dance. I should have such troubles. Anyway, love is hate and hate is love, or something like that. Julia Roberts barks out a mouthfull of obscenities, ripping open a sexual current not unlike an audio Hustler magazine teaser sound bite. Grrrroooowwll! Natalie Portman has a great lower back. Fish swim in The London Aquarium. Clive Owen, dude, if you can sing, if this acting thing don't work out, you could be the next Tom Jones. Natalie Portman, smart move. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! She looks around at the other actors and says, "Hey, you guys ain't thirtysomethings! You're all fortysomethings and Julia is ... I'm gonna beat it and find a younger crowd to swing with." Sweet move, darling. You'll always find work.

A big 'little' book by John Steinbeck concerning an unnamed army ( picture Nazis ), invading and conquering a small European town, and the lull in time that follows, as the invading army sits like a giant hen on the hopefully enlightened minds of newly formed citizenship. All grows impatient as the conquerer begins to doubt the superior word that they are winning the war, and the conquered, once willing overthrown people, sense insecurity and resort to terrorism. Steinbeck's work is mostly dialogue and reads like a taut play, and his eloquent passages speak clearly with no linguistic or cultural differences between the two groups of people, indeed they are all members of the human race, passing time like a bomb waiting to expire. Heavily indebted to Melville's "Billy Budd", ( one chapter seems an homage to Melville's tragedy ), I'm also reminded of a later work; William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick's "The Ugly American", in which an invading American army turns a corner of Vietnam into a bureaucratic nightmare. At 188 pages, ( hardbound ), "The Moon Is Down" reads very quickly, it possesses a timeless quality, being first published in 1942, just prior to American's entrance in World War II.

There was a collective grumble from the theatre audience as the words 'The End' flared up in thick old-fashioned style at the end of "Far From Heaven", the slick and glorious melodrama inspired by big budget posh living room movie sets of the 1950s. It seems we wanted more from this wretchedly docile story of a socially correct with a plus suburban socialite who catches her husband in the embrace of another. This seemed more parody than anything else. Picture Harriet Nelson polishing silverware and discovering someone has spit on the gravy server. There is simply no explaining the husband's near frantic reaction to protect his reputation when his wife is seen talking to the black gardener and his subsequent choice of lifestyle in a town he spent eight years earnestly building a good name in. Unless of course he lied and never did return to work as an electronics manufacturer executive, and had no intention of hanging around his lousy town, supporting his children or maintaining their Beaver Cleave home. That would leave the poor woman lower in social status than even ... even ... never mind. There's not enough sympathy for the guy here. Imagine caressing a woman knowing a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval may flare up at any moment.

I have little doubt this film depicts what it was like to be an American overseas during 9/11. Although it is never mentioned there seems to be no other reason for the constant inability to leave a Tokyo hotel, spend endless hours watching the tv, allow the camera to repeatedly capture the sight of Tokyo skyscrapers. It so conveys the feeling of being stuck somewhere that I felt increasing impatience and a bit of anxiety watching it. As it started, I was laughing with abandon at Bill Murray's culture clash with the Japaneese, but this initial amusement soon became restless as the culture of Japan is never seen as anything but a stereotype. Scarlett Johansson is sweet but dull as Murray's interest and Murray's character is soon diminished to a meaningless person as the director steers us into what must be her expression of 9/11. Thanks but no thanks. I have my own impressions.

I'm currently a bit hooked on classic mysteries (blame it on PBS's 'Mystery' series), and looking through my horde of books, I found Agatha Christie's "Third Girl", a 1966 work featuring Christie's famed Hercule Poirot. What is immediately striking is the setting of the novel; mod 1966 England, an odd place for Poirot who is, at least on TV, ususally associated with the 1930s and '40s. Also unexpected is Christie's kind narrative which is an impressive unbiased view of the era's youth drug culture; she speaks of junkiedom as if it were a passing teen fad, as serious or frivolous as any other era'a hang-ups. In "Third Girl", a young girl arrives in Poirot's office and announces she may have committed a murder. She disappears before Poirot can find out anything else regarding her bizarre statement and he spends the bulk of the novel searching for her and deciphering what she meant. Although there are a series of mini-who done its throughout the book, the question really is, "Say what?" I suspect hard core fans of the genre will confidentally figure this mystery out before it's conclusion, but I was over taxed with clues, and the resolution and the path leading up to it are a bit hokey, and reliant on extremely unlikely coincidences, facts and answers seem to fall at our detective's feet, and even though the final answer is like a product in an exquisite math equation, it is still a trick question. That's ok though, it's not so much the mystery which attracts me to the genre, particularly Christie's work; it's her heroes, their mannerisms and idiosyncracies, their minds, their friends, their homes and homes away from home, like Miss Marple reading Dashiel Hammett over a cup of tea when a gunshot is heard, or Hercule Poirot delving into a chocolate layered desert while paging through an art book on French paintings, when suddenly it occurs to him who the killer must be, and he calls everybody into the room to name the murderer. I like answers in a real world of little resolve.

I didn't believe for a moment the three main characters in this film were truly film buffs, their conversations on the subject were superficial and pedestrian. The incestuous relationship between two of them is absurb given their very ordinary lives and the film never explains the roots of the sibling's desire. The psychological movie games they played were as harmless and dull as children playing dress-up and seemed an excuse for a more exotic fantasy. This film about an American youth hooking up with sibling students in France during the Vietnam era is not an homage to movies or art or the French cinema, it is an attempt at sexual tension but the result is limp.

Perfectly representative of 80s music, Gene Loves Jezebel's "The House of Dolls" holds it's ground today as just good playful and meaningful rock and roll pop. The gushy and upbeat, "The Motion of Love" (a minor hit record), and back door romance of "Suspicion", would be standard rock love songs if not for GLJ's glittery and pounding treatment, both songs deliver an addictive melody with a relentless beat your mind won't feel guilty humming. The call and response falsetto vocal in "Every Door" lingers in an ocean of tic-toc percussion and jangly guitar. A bit like, The Alarm, a bit like, Pet Shop Boys, a bit like, Dream Syndicate, they represent 80s rock (not quite new wave), yet remain in a unique category of their own, call it hard playful pop.

Glam and sloppy hard rock with a pounding infectious rhythm, Hanoi Rocks seemed to be living in a boarded up garage in 1981, unaware of the incoming post punk and new wave invasion. While we were trading punk for new wave, and new wave for post punk, Hanoi Rocks remained in a glittery '70s cocoon of New York Dolls style screech and scowl falsetto vocals and Alice Cooper glam debauchery, delivering songs that peel out of the garage and drive faster than your old man's Buick. This is big hair rock and roll with a juvenile lunacy indebted to Small Faces and The Sweet. Glam meets garage.

It nails the white, suburban southern culture of modest homes and church-going Sundays down, in its story of two people from Chicago, who meet, marry after a week, and take a joint visit to his home town in North Carolina. He wants to introduce his bride to his family, while she hopes to gain the trust of an obscure, eccentric artist whose work she hopes to manage, who happens to live nearby.While the culture clash premise is finely presented, it never lays rest on the oppurtune family unit dynamics, instead offering brush stroke characterizations and conflicts with little development. The newlywed bride is treated with steely-eyed suspicions from most of her new family, and has conflicting emotions regarding her hope to capitalize on a promising new artist, and loyalty to her new family. The groom's hotheaded brother treats the couple with pent-up hatred, (we are to assume an uneducated brother will hate his older successful brother), and his young pregnant wife has nothing but love and adoration for them. Mom and Pop are typically elusive and understanding. Basically we are to believe that blood is thicker than blood-in-law.And that's it. Something happens that makes it all come together, somewhat, and that is the film. Something to think about, I suppose, like a flower growing or a death in the paper is something to think about. But it's a pretty short hayseed to chew on. We never really do meet the newly married couple from Chicago, despite their constant presence, while we learn as much as we need to know about the North Carolinians, who are sharply depicted as common with a capitol C. You know you're a redneck when you misplace the only Phillips screwdriver in the house and you're a woodworker.Amy Adams brings some life to the film as the sweet, rambunctious, pregnant sister-in-law, but that is only in contrast to the truly dull characterizations of the other players. Like junebugs in spring, this film boldly introduces itself and then quickly disappears.

I avoided this film for some time because the sensitive subject matter seemed a total bummer. The critical hype persuaded me to finally view it and it is as depressing (and fascinating!) as I imagined it to be. It's not that the child molesters in this film are not probably guilty of their accusations, it's that the legal system seemed anxious and insecure to prosecute these men as soon as lewd act red flags flew up, the Court Judge herself reminiscing that she "knew from the start these people were guilty". So much for innocent until proven. For a film depicting a well publicized news story, "Capturing The Freidmans", instead of remaining cold and detached becomes an earnest study of human drama.

"The Boy Who Could Fly" is a remarkable work of juvenile fiction about a boy who has the telepathic ability to read minds. Narrated in the second person point of view by the boy's older brother, the book is compassionate and moving and psychologically complex and made all the more vivid by haunting and innovative charcoal illustrations by Paul Sagsoorian. The older brother's attempts to shelter his gifted younger brother after the death of their parents is the thrust of the plot which evolves into a mysterious and profound character study. First published in 1967 and long out of print, the book deserves to be recognized as a classic in the field of juvenile fiction. Its psychological themes are a great introduction to young readers to a more complex fiction, yet it can be read as a thoroughly engaging story in itself. The 1986 movie of the same name seems to be very loosely based on the story.

One of the first artists to be signed to The Beatles' new found Apple Records in 1969, soft, quivering folk artist, Mary Hopkin, scored an international hit with a song derived from an obscure Eastern European ballad; "Those Were The Days", was an elaborate, five minutes-plus hit record, recalling a German folk pop nostalgia, an unlikely Top 40 sound that was ultimately accused of anti-Semitic sentiment with its Euro-tavern, post war, alcohol fueled longings:, "Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end, we'd sing and dance forever and a day, we'd live the life we'd choose, we'd fight and never lose, for we were young and sure to have our way." Paul McCartney produced this first Hopkin album which includes songs penned by, Donovan, (Lord of The Reedy River, Happiness Runs, Voyage of The Moon), Harry Nilsson, (The Puppy Song), and Beatles' producer, George Martin, (The Game), plus some unfortunate McCartney choices in the likes of show tunes by Gershwin, and the no surprise, "There's No Business Like Show Business". In her element as a folk artist, Hopkin possesses a strong, lilting, mermaid with a lair vocal delivery, rooted in traditional European folk, that seduces like a cross between a warm vodka and a cold lemonade. She's a fairly fine guitar strummer as well. The bonus tracks are an Italian and Spanish version of "Those Were The Days", (the Italian version sounds particularly fine and genuine), and the 'B' side of "Those Were The Days", an acoustic version of The Byrds' "Turn,Turn, Turn".

Compilation CD from Apple Records includes, what is likely the complete history of Hopkin singles through 1971, plus the previously unreleased, "When I Am Old One Day", which is a more charitable and conservative outlook of The Beatles' "When I'm 64". Signature song, the vodka in a Euro tavern ballad, "Those Were The Days", is here as is follow-up single, the McCartney/Lennon penned, lily o' the valley song, "Goodbye". The compilation works very well as a single listen of clean-cut folk pop, like Donovan Leach without the psychedelia, and Old English travelling virgin minstrel charm. "Temma Harbour", is a Sergio Mendes/Free Design-like plastic seascape of tanned bodies and white sea caps with popping Caribbean percussion, and "Water, Paper and Clay", is a lightweight, (the far extreme of blood, sweat, and tears), and solemn song prayer featuring a Joan Baez-like drum circle with echoing choir. Perhaps the most compelling track is the overly dramatic, but investing, "Let My Name Be Sorrow", a brooding Juliet mongering that swells like a storm into opera territory. The CD liner notes offer second hand, superficial filler on Hopkin's history.

We never do find out the source of Elizabeth Taylor's 'shrew's' dicontent and the idea of a woman being dominated into submission of behavior doesn't wash today, this still is a highly amusing, greatly acted and lushly filmed version of Shakespeare's comedy. The late Richard Burton is superb and very funny as the oppurtunistic and and reckless Petruchio.

I was surprised by the contrasting sophistication and corniness of this great old film, and dazzled by The Duke's natural, like he was born on a horse acting style. The ghosts of theatres past are ablaze in this movie as one can imagine the satisfaction beaming from the happy audiences of 1930.

When America's favorite paperback of recent times, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; premiered as a movie in 1973, it was carnival time in theatre lobbys and Hollywood corporate headquarters. The film took in big profits and patrons were behaving as if they too were possessed by the devil. Long lines waited to see swirling heads, defrocked priests and a little girl who was no Shirley Temple. People freaked, ran from the theatre, got sick. The news press reported of ambulances arriving at theatres to escort ill patrons to the hospital. I remember many a cold night standing in the snow waiting to get another look at this ... show. When those lobby doors closed it was like being trapped in a cage with a ferocious animal. The chaos on the screen was only matched by the chaos in the theatre where people alternately laughed and genuinely screamed at the ridicolous horror, sometimes in the same breath uncontrolably. As kids, we couldn't get enough of it. I must had seen it five times in it's premier week, every show a packed house of 'Rocky Horror' responses that were never planned. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was the tabloid 'catch phrase' of the day. It seems every church group in America was protesting the movie. There was talk that the story was based on the demonic possession of a Hollywood celebrity's child, we all knew who and we all believed it! We were told the real Catholic priests who played themselves in the movie were being ex-communicated from The Catholic Church, and yes, it's true, the Catholic Church rarely performs exorcisms. It was a glorious media ... circus and it retains that manipulative capitalist soul sucking spirit today. And to some of us it remains very dear. You see, the youth in 1973 could point up to the screen to a puke discharging, head spinning, foul-mouthed little girl with a fondness for crucifixes and say, &quot;You know, some days I feel like that.&quot;

Small time French gangster, dabbling in a real estate racket, renews his passion as a classical pianist, while falling deeper into the sordid world of low level gangster violence. He's got to protect his hands for his piano playing when he beats someone up, which is often, and no one, not his gangland buddies, who all look like they began stealing loaves of bread on the same French street corner, or his gangster father, who sees his son as the heir apparent to 'the big score', can understand his sudden desire for the ivories. This remake of, "Fingers", a rather obscure 1978 film starring Harvey Keitel, is a breezy and dramatic romp about one man's last chance to grab destiny by the throat, and strangle it. Does he succeed at his big audition with a famous conductor? You'll be hoping so with bated breath. Romain Duris, in the lead, as the petty criminal nursing an artistic desire, whether hunched over the piano striving for perfection, or slapping around a guy in a resteraunt, is as magnetic and fiery as an approaching meteor, Linh Dan Pham, as his piano teacher, with a talent all her own, harbors a wealth of dimure, ferociously reserved sexual appeal, and Niels Arestrup, as his worldly father, casts parental gazes only a dad could possess. My guess is that your heart will flip over, "The Beat That My Heart Skipped".

Yvan Attal, the French Woody Allen? Maybe. What's wrong with this film? Well, it doesn't amount to much. It's frivolous and unimportant. It needs a little Allen sermonizing on love and life to put a heart in the center of it's romantic spirit. What's right with this film? It's an engaging superficial comedic collage viewed as one would a not-very-deep but pleasing French painting of, say, summer people with parasols on a beach, or maybe a bird in a cage looking out the window to a beautiful morning while a lady with grey hair knits nearby. Suffice to say, I love this film. Director, writer and star Yvan Attal, who casts his real life wife, Charlotte Gainsbourg opposite him, is a comedic marvel, like a juggling, dancing all purpose clown at center stage of the circus refusing to let our eyes wander, as his ordinary life begins to unravel when he suddenly discovers a jealous streak towards his wife's romantic celebrity status. That is the thrust of the plot, but it all keeps rolling along in big, and little and sometimes contrived funny bits that pay off well.

I was paging through an alt-news weekly when I came across word that Kate Bush was releasing a new album that very week. My jaw sort of dropped. I held a grudge against her for dropping out of sight twelve years ago, leaving me at the ball holding a ruby red shoe, that not Tori, Bjork, Sarah or half a dozen others could fill. And don't even get me started on Joni.I didn't have to drive sixty miles through a snowstorm to get to the nearest record store on the day of it's release, but I was on vacation and I had nothing else to do. Salivating, I was.The new Kate Bush album, "Aerial", is a big wet kiss from Kate to her fan base. A piano driven, two disc, soft-rockish, set offering sweeping Bush soundscapes of shadowy valleys and sunshiney skies, haunting moments of beguiling vocal beauty, (if she says "washing machine" one more time, I don't know what I'll do), and a steady rock beat sure to get a middle-aged frame swinging. As intimate as writing in her diary in a garden, her focus is the child rearing of her son, who in, "Bertie", has, "the most truly, fantastic smile I've ever seen", and we can't help but agree after seeing his rosy, toothy grin in the accompanying family photos. Soft and sweet Winnie the Pooh references and bird songs filter through disc two like a trusting, protective nanny while mom embraces the piano, the laid back and smooth lapping wave back beats, and inside word to her fans that she's been busy mopping the floor, raising her son, contemplating her late mother's life, and in the title track, a stunning and wild prog rock and dance club extravaganza, guarding herself against the mystical and real demons of stardom.Thank you, Kate for the lifetime of pleasure your music has given me. It was worth the wait, although twelve years is an awfully long time. And while we're talking, could you please, TOUR AMERICA!

Colorful picture book boasts fine loving photographs of junk collected in American junk shops by the author, a self confessed junk junkie. The minimal text is sometimes awkward, the author is a more accomplished photographer than she is a writer, and the hundreds of photos are brilliant eye-catching motifs of both, truly collectible antiques and other people's garbage, like amateur paint-by-numbers paintings of dogs. Although the author pays very little for her vast array of objects; $20.00 seems to be the average price, she seems to purchase a home every time she runs out of space to display her treasures, and her constant references to places like "the summer home in Millenton" become a bit daunting.

True story of Burt Munro, who in the 1960's, was compelled to take his 1920's era Indian motorcycle from his native New Zealand, across the ocean to the Utah Bonneville Salt Flats to break a motorcycle land speed record, makes for an elegant film, engrossing in it's simplicity, and as involved as any great story can be. Anthony Hopkins brings a passive, indefensive determination and a hard earned and folky willpower to the aged hero who sees nothing strange in hauling his relic of a motorcycle, (a champagne cork serves as a fuel cap, a refrigerator latch secures the engine), across the ocean to a barren lake bed just to see how fast it will go. Director Roger Donaldson, who filmed a documentary on Munro twenty-five years before this film, and has confessed to being obsessed with his subject, has as much positive human detail to reveal in Burt, as he does about the various New Zealanders and Americans fortunate enough to step into Munro's world. A feel-good movie without the sloppy sentiment, you're going to want to stand up and cheer a true winner.

Hard rock? Alt-country? Indie? It's hard to tell but this sounds to me like an ordinary promo debut rock act. The guitars seem particularly unexceptional, 80s hair maybe with few creative ideas and the vocals/lyrics invoke bold cliches (why not another numbered nervous breakdown?) and mention Jesus Christ so many times I'm beginning to suspect this is Christian rock disguised as cool.

With a band name more suggestive of a cheap packet of garden seeds, as opposed to anything Greenday may covet, Garden Variety's 1996 debut has 15 tracks, all sounding like an angrier Superchunk, and all nearly interchangable in their similiarity. This can be a bad thing for half-listening ears; the drone of these punkish songs may sound like the same song repeating, and a good thing for the attentive, who may find the exceptional hoarse garage vocals, constant guitar, and loud drums, pounding the same path in each song deceiving, as it leaves subtle progressions and changes to the sonic landscape, more revealing in it's totality, than the sum of it's parts, like a plot of bare earth becoming a garden with a little help from Miracle-Gro. Drummer Joe Gorelick created the cool street scene artwork on the CD front and back cover, looking like the work of an excited Van Gogh after an outing with Greenday.

I didn't dislike "The Constant Gardener", but given it's critical buzz, it didn't live up to my expectations. In it, a British conservative bureaucrat marries a liberal activist who becomes involved in uncovering a pharmaceutical corporation conspiracy. She tries to prove impoverished Africans are being used to test new dangerous pharmaceuticals.Director Fernando Meirelles (City Of God), films a glorious, remote and colorful country focussing on the poor, highlighted by aerial panoramas of red-baked seaside cliffs, green roving, grassy plains, and raw images of ingenious peoples and locales. The cinematography overwhelms the topical but standard suspense-thriller story, becoming nearly condescending in it's constant touting of the real poor in Africa. The enormity and plight of starving diseased Africans stands like a giant next to the fictitious, and often thin, characterizations of the two lead characters.I couldn't buy the character of Tessa, as a humanitarian activist. Her character is flighty, a bleeding heart if you will, without roots to empathetic response to human suffering. She is more like a Peace Corp volunteer than a genuine activist. The emotional intention of the film may be to depict her as sweet and naive, but her superficial probing and brow bending suspicions, blunted a sharp edge the film may have possessed, had her character been more secure in responding to abusive global corporations.Despite these reservations, the second half of "The Constant Gardener", improves over the first considerably, as the 'suspense-thriller' dynamics are set into gear, and the chase, so to speak, is on. Before then, the constant merry-go-round romantics of the starry-eyed lead characters become superfluous and annoying. He loved, loved, loved her, with all his heart, heart, heart. We get, get, get it.As in his "City Of God", concerning the slums of Brazil, director Meirelles photographs a stunning human vista of a suffering and splendorous Africa. The conspiracy thriller aspect of it, is often only secondary.

The Amazon editorial review for Royksopp's "Melody A.M." declares, "Arguably the best album of 2002". Well, here's the argument: This is derivative drivel. Minimal song structures with elaborate trappings consisting of dropped and bent notes to make the contrived melody more interesting. The constant weak musical passages serving as songs give way to worn lyrical melodies making the whole CD ring like a shallow musical grave. At best, the third track, "Sparks" sounds like England's 'Broadcast' after a few double martinis and the fifth, "Poor Leno" is certainly late '90s 'Everything But the Girl". I'll be darned if I don't hear 'The Pet Shop Boys' in here as well if you were to poke them with a stick and force them to make a new album. It all sounds very familiar and I suspect it's a case of buried and disguised plagiarism.

OK, so I forgot to send my order card back in time to a certain mail-order record club and I'm stuck with the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; Soundtrack. It's not so bad. As movie soundtracks go, it's a little tough for a collection of songs to resemble Spider-Man, but these teen-oriented, rock driven testements of the day are as fun and entertaining as your favorite second string Super Hero. Just try not to sing along to the vocal anthem joy of rock and roll in Sum 41's &quot;What We're All About&quot;. The sensitive &quot;Bother&quot; by Corey Taylor reaches dramatic tuneful plateaus, and The Hive's &quot;Hate To Say I Told You So&quot; sounds like old recharged Kinks records with a 2003 mega production team. Infected&quot;s &quot;I-IV-V&quot; is a diamond in the rough and tough modern rock sound asking the unlikely question, &quot;What's your favorite color?&quot;, and standing out like a whiz kid in a classroom of degenerates, and Jerry Cantrell's &quot;She Was My Girl&quot;. the album's best track, is as rock and roll monumental as say, Blue Oyster Cult's &quot;Don't Fear The Reaper&quot;. Almost everything else sounds like Stone Temple Pilots or Pearl Jam to me, but so does most of rock radio. The movie themes by Danny Elfman are like clouds in search of a celestial melody and it takes forever for them to roll by. The final song, Aerosmith's &quot;Theme From Spider Man&quot; is a bit uninspired in the midst of these teen beat rock records and it's like pulling up a chair for Grandpa who commands both respect and boredom.

Dan Ackroyd's first starring vehicle after the success of the original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; is a weak disjointed comedy wherein he plays a college professor who must pose as a mob boss. The scenes with a rival crime czar, a woman named 'Mom', are grotesque and funny but Ackroyd never fits comfortably in the role as he did in hundreds of SNL skits.

&quot;Caravan&quot; was a nominee for Best Foreign Film at The 1999 Academy Awards, and it caused quite a stir due to it's then limited availability and pro Tibetan stance, ( Present day China wishes to capitalize on the merits of Tibetan society and include it in it's Republic ). It is reissued theatrically in a limited run in 2001 under the new title, &quot;Himalaya&quot;, an apparent attempt to bring attention to the spectacular Himalayan scenery that abounds in the film. The plot revolves around a seasonal migration by Tibetan trade merchants ( miners ) to harvest salt in The Himalayas. At first, the amateur cast is difficult to bare, over emphasized dialogue, a lot of fake grinning, but as the film progresses the short-ranged realism invoked by these Tibetan actors achieves a documentary-like quality which wouldn't have been reached had the cast been professionally trained. By reel's end, they find solid ground in the humbleness of their performances depicting the peacefulness of Tibetan culture. The drama builds to a deeply satisfying conclusion and the suspenseful mountain action sequences reminds us we don't need high-tech wizardry to make a mountain exciting. This is one beautiful picture.

Very funny adaptation of the William Inge play finds Marilyn Monroe romantically abducted by country bumpkin who has fallen in love with her. Monroe is ravishing and sympathetic as the saloon girl Cheri turned unwilling fiance and Don Murray in a debut performance as the hardheaded Bo finds a great mix of whooping and hollering and real romantic depth. Some of Bo's manhandling of Cheri gets a bit harsh in accordance with cinematic sexual mores of 1956; a skirt tail is ripped off, she is helplessly hoisted upon his shoulder, but this is effectively an innocent and touching film with just the right amount of naivete.

Exploring the dark psyche that is Lambchop's "Is A Woman", I have to ask, like David Letterman, "Is this anything?". Kurt Wagner's inspiring bizarre lyrics sound like they will be the last words spoken from a dying man into an empty amplified drinking glass. The brooding often beautiful and odd music creates a soothing trance-like effect as comforting as a lullaby and as menacing as The Pied Piper of Hamlin coaxing rats from the city. Is this anything? Yes, but exactly what besides beautiful and bizarre, may require a few more spins on the disc player.

David Lynch's cosmic black and white film of the life of John Merrick is a rewarding movie experience. Quite touching without being sensational it extracts dynamic performances from John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft. Director David Lynch has somehow combined the grimy grey bleakness of old London with the bright hope of a better tomorrow. Black and white indeed. Some scenes, like the elephant man's memory of his mother, and the doctor's first examination of him are so moving they pain until tears swell in your eyes.

Irresponsible investigative documentary alleging Mrs. Kurt Cobain, (Courtney Love), is responsible for the death of her husband, founder of the grunge band, Nirvana. Docu-maker Nick Broomfield, boots about Seattle, film camera hoisted on his shoulder, justice shrouded on his weathered face, interviewing seedy insignificant type, who look like they agreed to speak in exchange for money to feed a drug habit. One junkie drug dealer, with an unfocused attention span, reacts to the filmmaker's murder-mystery questions, as if saying, "Dude, are you out of your mind?". Dismay ensues Broomfield's righteous crusade as backers of his film in progress abandon the project after pressure from, (did I hear this right?), ...MTV? More likely they saw a preview of this very meaningless film.No doubt, rock and roll nightmare, Courtney Love, raised by a man interviewed in the film that one would like to spit on, was about the worst thing that could have happened to Kurt Cobain. This attack on her however, is grossly unjustified, given the film doesn't turn a single stone in support of its meek accusation. With the handfuls of third rate theorists offering hungry opinions, no one comes off worse than the filmmaker himself. In an apparent effort to save his film from total vacancy, he finally steps up to a microphone platform, after Love has spoken at a Civil Liberties union, and publicly accuses her of dodging questions regarding the death of her husband. Here the film achieves its only characteristic, - an empty documentary starring a jerk.

The 'other' Truman Capote bio film, which came on the heels of the successful Oscar winning "Capote", also examines Capote's non-fiction writing of the slaughter of the Cutter family, and his relationship with the killers. Toby Jones, as Capote is more extravagant, more expressive and feminine than Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance, and there lies here a greater vulnerablity, a weakling inside a wolf's coat, a Capote whose insecurities are clearly evident beneath an exterior manner of confidence and vanity. When he is attacked by one of the killers, (Daniel Craig), in a jail cell, he cowers like a frightened child, when he reveals his own childhood traumas, in comparison with the killer's, all masks and manipulative attitude disappears, as if revealing a real person, without pretension for the first time. I don't know why there was a sudden interest in Capote writing In Cold Blood, the groundbreaking true crime book of 1966, but both movies, while attempting to present a character study of Capote, are overshadowed by the sensational and brutal murder of the Cutter family. It's difficult to access Capote's psychological struggle while the hunt for the killers carries on off-screen, as Capote and his New York literary friends sip wine and chat with the enamored townspeople, who after a silence campaign, accept Capote as an eccentric oddity they enjoy rubbing elbows with. I liked the nostalgic New York cocktail party scene, with literary art types learning how to do Chubby Checker's The Twist. It is another world compared with the bleak empty Kansas farmland where the murder occurs. The dialogue with the killers seemed at times, to be coy and unconvincing, as they find reason to put trust in the New York writer in a feminine fur coat, with the nasal muted voice described here as "if a brussels sprout could talk". It takes only a few manipulative and pat tricks from Capote to gain their trust, one being his familiarity with Marlon Brando. The two Capote movies are surprisingly alike, covering similiar ground, making sly mention of Capote ally Harper Lee's next novel after To Kill A Mockingbird, which was, and is still, unfullfilled, but both films accept the sad murder of the family as merely a sub-plot to reveal Capote as a troubled man, and neither films compare to the original writing and the 1967 film by Richard Brooks, which too reveal the writer as deeply affected by his relationship with the doomed killers.

As if having worked out peculiar leanings of logic and coherency with his last film, &quot;The Straight Story&quot;, Writer-Director David Lynch returns with vengeance to his familiar style of psyched-out paranoia with the weird odyssey, &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot;. This, like his sci-fi nightmare &quot;Lost Highway&quot; is a gargantuan &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; crashing through the roof of stability and meaning and then plunging into the depths of complexity and bombastic film noir. But unlike &quot;Lost Highway&quot; which dropped me off the journey without a hitch back to the impossible plot, I was with &quot;Mulholland Dr.&quot; for every curve in the road, studying landmarks and tossing bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretal hoping to find my way back to Mulholland Drive. It didn't matter because the whole thing soon explodes into a splendid visual and literal horizon of L.A. decadence barreling over any sign posts it may have made on the way. It's something like a Hollywood Hills cocktail party from Hell. Maybe something to do with the death of Marilyn Monroe. It's like flipping through the pages of old black and white movie magazines of car crashes and dead celebrities. It is the adult nightmare that belongs to a 5 year-old. It says something about the vitality of youth crossing paths with the declination of age. It doesn't matter what it says or what it's about. Somewhere deep within the recesses of my shady human mind, I think I understand.

Jefferson Airplane evolves into Jefferson Starship in this 1974 album that, despite the name change, seems a natural progression of the Airplane's cosmic minded, hippie drenched music. Marty Balin returns to the band with the stunning and dramatic rock epic, "Caroline"; a 7-minutes plus progressive ballad that soars like a released bird into flight. Paul Katner's "All Fly Away", is a hallucinegenic dream of other worldly horizons that offers H.G. Wells imagery in a world where "we rode a bubble to the sun,... there were men with fiery wings". Grace Slick's "Devil's Den" is a clever jaunting word play with fiddle,(Papa John Creech), assessing time running out on an evil capitalistic nation, that gets slightly sinister in Slick's spoken line followed by a creepy mocking laugh, "he thinks he's born to glory". Opening track, "Ride The Tiger" offers Jefferson's leftist political leanings in a racially divided America that needs to 'ride the tiger' to a better tomorrow, and Grace Slick's "Hyperdrive", (she once cited it as one of her favorite compositions), combines cosmic imagery with scientific logic, in yet another attempt to leave this world for another, asking quite eloquently, "where do you go on a night that is clear and warm?", along with bizarre geometric inclined lines like, "I've heard circles moving right through corners". The song, "That's For Sure", (love that indifferent group harmony), is a windswept hilltop of life and death philosophy, and "Come To Life", comes alive as a catchy rocker with touching nostalgia, "remember the times and places, glass eyed stares from glowing faces?". Dragon Fly is a humble and confident offering from the Jefferson clan, and it's got one of the best cover arts of the '70's.

This is a funky laid-back album that never lived up to the potential it's hit single, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; suggests. The other songs are folkie rockers and Harry Nielson-like sleepers that never get very wild. Still, if Lou Reed wants to dig a ditch and wallow in it, I'll listen.

CIA intrigue, political assasins, an amnesiac hero, cool car chases, a lovely damsel in not too much distress, what more can you ask of a spy thriller based on a Robert Ludlum novel? Stop and breathe for a moment and you may realize this is little more than one long chase scene. But the exotic European locations, and believable if not comic book performances move this along faster than a high speed European railway system. It's all pretty exciting, if not complex. Give a CIA assasin amnesia and all sorts of things are bound to happen. But mostly he'll be chased. There's a conviction here that could wipe the smirk off James Bond's face in a moment.

"One Hour Photo" isn't as creepy and sordid as I expected. Robin Williams as a sex criminal didn't sound like my idea of a good time, but the film is really just a good suspense thriller despite it's lurid, pathetic lead character, a photograph developer who psychotically fantasizes about a young family whose pictures he develops. Cinematography is often as vulnerable and crisp as a color photo and the direction is taut, with the exception of the blindfold over the viewer's eyes concerning the outcome of the climactic scene. "One Hour Photo" is not the nightmare I was expecting but is a very good suspense thriller.

Try as it might to be otherwise, this is still a man-on-a-deserted-island story and there's a lot of campfires and spear fishing going on and a vague life lesson about deserted islands. The surf is much more inviting than the island which remains an unexplored vista. Tom Hanks watching the rolling whitecaps is a haunted, alien scene. Exactly what Hank's character is doing on that cargo plane is anyone's guess. And when will Helen Hunt stop agreeing to anything?

A very odd, entertaining and funny animated film that is not without a profound message about the joy of living. I heard a lot about the funny dog in this film, but I was not prepared for the hilarity and skilled craft of the filmmakers who make this dog, very nearly, the only dog to be truly brought to life in animation. It's an imaginative and vivid romp through France and the final few moments are truly touching.

When Robert Downey is in session with his psychiatrist to cure his depression from a rare disfiguring skin disease, this movie truly 'sings' The quick witty banter between the two could have justified the whole film. But when the 'singing detective' imagines his new detective yarn we're treated to what looks like a long Robert Palmer music video from the '80s. Real empty-headed stuff. Also, childhood trauma lies at the root of this mystery and that goes way against the grain of the detective film noir style the movie was certainly aiming at. Uneven is the word.

Michael Gira's ode to darkness is given new light, as it were, in the 1999 debut album of his most recent creation, Angels of Light, both a passive defiance of Christianity, as a few songs praise Jesus for the path to secular normality, and a remarkably quiet regard to his listeners who are the object of his dark humanist affection. Gira is at the center of a group of credited yet anonymous sounding musicians, who don't so much as form an ensemble, as they dillegently support the brooding quirkiness of Gira's haunting moods, save the supporting choral vocals who sound like someone Leonard Cohen or Tom Waits would hire to give a song some melodic charm. Behind Gira, such gleeful harmonies sound like a curse, a contradiction of sweet and sour. This is certainly nothing like industrial, metal, goth Swans, Gira's first band, no more anguished screams to the pagen god of the sky, nor anything like Drainland, a solo work which finds him knee deep in thunderstruck commoner insight, like a profound message from a drunk. In Angels of Light's "New Mother", Gira is content to strum his guitar and sing (practice) his voice in variations on religion and politics in the form of a distant lover, and the result is slow-going and singularly atmospheric, like Gira speaking to you from across a table with a megaphone. I could almost say it's a bit indulgent, except Gira has already proven his worth. Given the downtempo dour heartbeat of these songs, the angels of light casts all shadows.

Female cowboy rider dressed in black whips outlaws into submission. What is this, kinky vintage pornography from the 1940's? Shoot, it's just another western serial, and a rather lame one at that. When crime fighter The Black Whip dies, his sister discovers his secret identity, and assumes the black outfit, whip and horse of the famed do-gooder. The poor beautiful and bland girl assumed none of his better acting style. Horses and third string outlaws upstage her.Trip wire horses, trot-galloping turned up fast speed, a movie-set hideout underneath a waterfall, and an earnest history lesson on fighting for justice to insure Idaho becomes a state. Where do I get the medal for sitting through all twelve episodes? The best thing, the only thing about it, is the assured camera work of close-up stunt riding.But hold on, partner. There's gold in these hills in the form of bonus feature, "The Bold Caballero", a 1936 Zorro classic with Robert Livingston as the legendary crude artist, and Heather Angel, as his royal seniorita, dabbling in daring escapes, sassy swordplay, slapstick humor and yes, enough romance to snap a whip at.

Natascha McElhone may be a fine actress but her 'who am I, where am I?' portrayal of a deceased woman materializing in outer space lacks much conviction of whatever the film is trying to convince us of. There are moments of intense drama here; George Clooney blankly staring at a torn jagged hole in the spaceship wall, but there is also a dreary unsensational flashback romance occupying most of the film that moves like a wedding march to a funeral drum and does little to build suspense or understanding. The movie intersperses to the image of pink neon gasses surrounding the planet Solaris constantly as if saying, to increasing annoyance, 'meanwhile back on the ranch&quot;. &quot;Solaris&quot; could have been intriguing if it had realized it's psychological and cinematic potential as alternative science-fiction. Come to think of it, haven't I seen all this before, albeit on a much smaller budget, in an episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;?

Teen-age love angst with a peculiar feminist slant from three brothers?, cousins?, with the same last name of Caterer and a drummer who make up the disbanded but fondly remembered 'Smoking Popes'. This is breezy power pop with a dominating lead guitar, a little like 'The Smiths' or 'Talking Heads', but without the psyche hangover of pent up emotion. Singer and lyricist Josh Caterer clearly wants something but is it the girl or just the girl's dress? His quest for love's renewal is so insistant, he sounds on the verge of becoming the woman he wants. &quot;Just Broke Up&quot; and &quot;Need You Around&quot; are great radio songs, if only there was a radio station that would play them.

Big, bland, boring saga that manages to turn the excitement of thoroughbred racing into a dull pony ride. The characters are empty shells given sympathy from tragic pasts that are hammered home early in the film, and Seabisquit himself remains an anonymous animal whose only mannerisms and character are told to us through a voice over narration. Sudden artsy camera work, a purposeless, nearly silent female lead, and a constant attempt to insure the film doesn't veer into "Lassie Come Home" territory make for a sometimes visually beautiful but deadly dormant day at the track. "Seabisuit" gets scratched at the post.

Dependent on the unlikely actions of several characters, &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; is a heavy-handed, utterly earnest excersize in contemporary tragedy. I understand that Jennifer Connely's character is supposed to be an average American whose life history remains obscure but her reason for being involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of a modest home is so unlikely it is rendered shallow. The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog.

Dynamic and lush production and Jewel's soul-deep enriched vocals, (she can go deep into a bass register, and high into soprano, and yodels like she just came down from the mountaintop), make "Pieces of You", her debut Grammy-winning album of 1995, a stunner of an album. Since then, she has yet to capitalize on a successful career, flittering in and out of the popular charts without the impact and artistic success of this album, which combines at least three outstanding tracks, ("Who Will Save Your Soul?", "You Were Meant For Me", and "Foolish Games"), with school-girl poetics on bigotry and homophobia, which are presented as naive and honest as a first training bra. Her in-your-face sweet righteousness is enough to make you cringe at the dopey sincerity, ("Jew ... Do you hate him because he's pieces of you?"). She possesses a genuine folksy charm which can roar like an urban lion as she reaches soulful masculine tinged registers in her gorgeous voice; "Who will save your soul', she pleads so deeply, 'when you won't save your own?", in outstanding opening track, "Who Will Save Your Soul?". "Pieces Of You" is pieces of Jewel, an emotionally fragile and solid songwriter wrapped in string enriched orchestration, guitar strumming folk, live acoustic, and mind settling balladry. The years have been kind to this album. I like it today more than yesterday, when it was merely an album with a few good tracks.

A drummer for people who only need a beat, some guitar to make it easy to move your feet, add a little baritone, and a right out-a-site organ, (no horns though), and Steven Tyler Aerosmith vocal inspiration, and you got pure and slick, perfect and corporate, riffed and hooked rock and roll from Aussie band, Jet. Hey, this stuff is nearly perfect. Who said rock is dead when infectious drum beat meets thumping bass, and guitar adds some electric twang, and you expect to hear Golden Earring's RADAR LOVE, or any of a number of great lead-in songs. This band has the lead-in down cold, (you know, it all started with The Supremes' YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE), and the substance that follows isn't half bad. ROLLOVER DJ has a great head-bobbing vocal and riff, ("Hey Rollover DJ, got nothing to say?, mind if I play?") - not really the verse sang here, but it fits as good as any, and it rhymes. And sure, be above it, - boldly lean on The Beatles' SEXY SADIE, on track 4, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE, right down to the resounding half-note piano key, half the kids listening never heard the original, and it sounds great. No, really. And I like The Strokes influence. And when was the last time you heard the blues as basis for great rock and roll on modern rock radio? Zepplin? And I LIKE the ballads. You can't have all riffs and hooks all the time. It would get monotonous. RADIO SONG, ("This won't be played on your radio, tonight"), a dreamy ballad makes absolutely no sense, and I find myself singing along to it on the second listen. That's craft. Closing track, TIMOTHY, at first seems a haunting reference to LSD explorer Timothy Leary, ("Timothy, we found your spaceship, ...it's the farthest you've ever flown"), but on repeated listens, seems much more profound, like a questioning of the very existence we live in, ("It's not what it seems, but it is"), - toke doobie, stare at the moon, and think about it. Nice melody too. And a fine rock album. All in all, I like it, I can bop my head to it, I wish I were 17 years old again, and I give it 4 stars.

Earnest, Disney-like film about a boy who tries to save his bull from the matador's ring in Mexico City. The ride atop an old farm truck into Mexico City is a beautiful scene suggesting a &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; affection and the only drawback is the kid's unremarkable ability to show expressions of joy, sadness, excitement, etc., as the camera focuses in on his face. The bull makes for a unique, likeable hero. The film won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay of 1956.

A kinder, gentler, Robyn Hitchcock and The Egyptians album, (save the nursery rhyme-like, "The Yip Song", and the grunting, lecherous, "Wafflehead"), with respect due, according to the liner notes to Raymond Hitchcock, (father?), and John Lennon. The partiarchal inspiration is evident in the soft bongo and acoustic driven transcendence of generations in "Railway Shoes", a slice of lazy day sunshine in brand spanking new shoes, - "the ghost of your father is right by your side, he's so close to you that he's almost inside, he's guiding your head and he's guiding your limbs, but he isn't you, and you know you're not him, in your railway shoes." Beatlesque influences filter throughout, with Asian-Indian "Baby, You're a Rich Man", sounds in the hallucinogenic, "When I Was Dead", - "When I was dead, I wore a strong perfume...". Hitchcock embraces Lennon's crusade for love and peace, without Audrey Hepburn's tentacle feelers and other morphing metaphors, in honest and global love songs that are surprisingly deft and touching. "Arms of Love", is more emotional than anything U2 might plead by, and 'Love' is lost like a ship downed at sea, in "The Wreck of The Arthur Lee", a seeming reference to Arthur Lee's prog rock ensemble, "Love", and his abandonment of humanist spirituality in favor of a more conventional Christian belief. But, there's more. "The Moon Inside", is a spooky, multi-layered techno rock haunt of mortality and demise, and "Driving Aloud (Radio Storm)", is a rewarding, joyous, pop stomp of heroic, life saving radio waves. Given Hitchcock's penchant for borderline bipolar observations, "Respect", is like an escape from the ward, for a few rationale moments of love and respect.

It was enlightening to see East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down depicted as a modest patriotic country in this warm amusing tale of a young man who goes to great lenghts to shield his mother from the unification of Germany. The already contrived comedic situatiion gets bogged down in the second half with the mother slipping in and out of comas and hospitals, her character becomes the picture of tragic consequences and robs the film of it's gentle light-heartedness. There is also a bit of clumsiness in the young man's infatuation with his long gone father and an East German astronaut, who apparently served as a father figure. The two characters look alike and, as shadows from the past, are seen as the same, lending a bit of confusion. Daniel Bruhl as the young man carries this film single-handedly with his undaunted determination to protect his mother but even his dynamic presence becomes a wee tiresome as his mother succumbs to illness. It seems this tragic angle doesn't absorb well into the hopeful texture of the film.

Surround Robyn Hitchcock with strings, prancing piano, harmonic backing vocals, and perfect pop song structure, and you have, Robyn Hitchcock and The Egyptians."Queen Elvis", from 1989, offers Hitchcock's bizarre and funny wordplay, ("yesterday I saw the devil in my food. I wasn't hungry, but I played with it."), in several carefully knit and catchy pop song crafts. "Wax Doll" stabs the heart of the friendly pop sound with it's lingering, aching refrain, "Is your wax doll still crying in the fire?", (I used to think the line said, "If your work's done, they're still praying in the valley", - I liked that too!), and "Superman", is a jangly guitar ode to a precious toy found in a cereal box, that reaches incredulous heights, -"It took the holy Roman Empire just to keep you satisfied, and I'm going to be more careful with you, aren't I?". "Queen Elvis" is a neatly trimmed album on a constant wavelength of melodic delights edged by Hitchcock's descriptive ponders that take frightening and beautiful shape. REM's Peter Buck adds guitar on several cuts, and violinist/composer Jocelyn Pook, who composed the devil ritual music in the film, "Eyes Wide Shut", offers her lofty and stinging strings on "The Devil's Coachman", and "Wax Doll".

Supertramp's Roger Hodgson's first solo album from 1984 is, like the worst of Supertramp, big and bland, and overloaded with the vague empty imagery of prog rock, where the object of desire; an unidentified god, self, or lover, is expressed in the worst of amateur poetry cliches - "Time is always on the run, we've only just begun, lovers in the wind." It's line after line of this Kansas meets Karen Carpenter blandness, but Hodgson's whiny, happy lunatic vocals recall Supertramp's most infectious songs, and sometimes this mirrored canary in a cage sings a sweet, if mindless tune, as in the final track, "Only Because of You", a thunderhead of nothing sentiment, but a gloomy prog rock haunt that should get you comfortably staring into the void, provided you ask nothing of your empty space. It's a rainy day Supertramp album in dire need of the group's production values.

Oh no, another dreary indie rock record. The Comas should fall farther into their comatose state or snap out of it completely, as this record fails to excite or seduce. Imagine if you will Radiohead crossed with Marcy Playground or barbed wire crossed with cotton candy. The gentle sing-songy vocals are joined by a lot of uninspired blip and bleep sound effects that become annoying and the melodic hooks demand attention like an insect buzzing around your face does.

A book collector is hired to determine the authenticity of a book allegedly written by Satan. If this Roman Polanski horror vehicle helped finance his subsequent &quot;The Pianist&quot;, well then, so be it. It is a rambling, increasingly tedious and superficial suspense thriller starring Johnny Depp, whose one-note negativism as an unscrupulous bibliophile doesn't contrast well with the overall dullness of the film. The lead lady's bizarre supernatural powers look like a paraplegic Peter Pan on training wheels.

Even the title sounds dated. Originally meant as a jab at the then current crop of self-help hitchhiking guides; The Hitchhiker's Guide To Travelling Across Europe, for example, "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" offers warm nostalgia to lovers of Douglas Adams' cult classic sci-fi comedy, but may be perceived as a meteroic lead weight swarming with silly ideas and aged humor to others. While the answer to The Ultimate Question, as posed in the story, (The answer is 42 but nobody can remember the question), and a recital of the third worst poetry ever written, still seem like comedic genius in concept, their execution here is stale and contrived, like familiar trophies alongside Monty Python's Spam joke and Lumberjack Song in the comedy hall of fame. This all played better in the original BBC-TV serialized production, it's low budget and weekly half hour soap opera-like installments served the story of the vagabonds in space well, with almost all emphasis on comedy and character. Here, Hollywood looms like a star filled galaxy over what amounts to some snappy dialogue and clever ideas. Still, like the original book became a cult classic, so might this movie. It's difficult to assess from an original perspective, so ingrained is the book and it's sequels in my mind. Sam Rockwell plays a very funny, egotistical, opportunistic 'President' of the Universe, but earthlings Arthur (Martin Freeman) and girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel), fade into cyber-dust as Rockwell steals every scene. Hollywood has proposed that this will be the first in a series of five movies based on the book and it's sequels. I wish them well and I would remind them that it is the Hitchhiker's Guide itself which holds the keys to the universe and is a Bible-like reference against danger and death to our protagonist. Consult the guide. Don't panic.

Texas Ranger, (John Wayne) enlists the aid of wanted fugitive, (Stuart Whitman), to bust gunrunning operation. Everything you can expect from a Wayne western, with eye-popping Cinerama,(or whatever they called it in 1961), rousing musical theme that becomes a little less so by the fourth or fifth ride into the sunset, dancing skirt sashaying senioritas, (hoochie-koochie, anyone?), standard western stunts, (falling horses, especially), and a still cloudy distinction of the American Indian as being either 'wild', (bloodthirsty scalpers of white people), or 'tame', (sell their soul for a cheap bottle of whiskey and a good cigar). Love interest Ina Bolin, (dark, mysterious, like you can picture a whip in her hand), adds some Mexican zing to the mix, but man, those are some nasty wigs she wears.

Interesting documentary about one of the first pay-tv services in America offers intriguing film clips from several beloved, obscure and notorious films. I didn't think anything could have me consider sitting through Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" again, but it looked like another film entirely seen from this perspective. The documentary's main objective; a bio of famed 'Z' programmer Jerry Harvey, proves him to be an aggressive and heroic movie lover, but in the final analysis, he is only what his last act proves him to be. Aside from some manic behavior, it would seem some personal insight into the tragic outcome of his life could have been revealed. His unfortunate wife is regarded as a woman of no significance. As it is, the joy of movie-loving so intensely felt here, is overshadowed entirely by the meaningless, pitiful tragedy, akin to celebrating O.J. Simpson as a great sports hero.

Given the complexity of the world's illegal drug trade, &quot;Traffic&quot; is a trickle of activity concerning drug trafficking between Tijuana, Mexico and The United States. It depicts a very accessible and obvious ladder of good and evil underworld hierarchy that includes South American drug cartels, a reluctant government informant right out of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, a United States drug czar who battles illegal global drug trade but can't stop it in his own home, and a Mexican drug task officer fighting corruption in his own ranks. In &quot;Traffic&quot;, the distinction between good guys and bad guys is obvious with little depth of character aside from either fighting or distributing drugs. The token drug addict here is so 'high', she behaves like a relic from the 1960s psychedelic scene, &quot;Far out man, I see colors!&quot;. The over-ridden action sequences are cliched drug smuggling bits of bullets and blow-ups less compelling than even an episode of TV's &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. There is a moral right-wing quaintness to &quot;Traffic&quot; that suggests we confront illegal drug use one pathetic addict at a time. Where serious answers lie to escalating drug use in America, we get instead an all encompassing theme that 'drugs are bad' laden in melodramatic trifle more akin to Joe Friday's &quot;Dragnet&quot; than it is to Hollywood's big drug statement. After nearly 2 1/2 hours of this tedious action and morality, I needed a Tylenol.

Special edition episodes of Ab Fab DVD containing "The Last Shout", and "In New York"."The Last Shout" is my favorite Ab Fab episode. I love the breezy, sunny, renewed expression of the opening shots, with light commercial music filling the air, playing on radios in at least three seperate locations, that never would have sounded as good anywhere else, accompanying a cocaine fueled Patsy preparing for a job interview, a vacation planning Edina listening to upbeat, watered down hit music in therapeutic headphones, (she listens to "Good Morning, Starshine", and repeats phrases aloud like, "think happy thoughts."), and a starry-eyed Safron about to accept a marriage proposal. Reality busts through this complacency as Edina is devestated by news of her daughter's marriage, Patsy would rather party than work, and Safron falls victim to her fiance's patriarchal ways. It's a blueprint for some of Ab Fab's funniest moments, spearheaded by the show's unique brand of social relevance and poignant and outlandish humor. It just bubbles over with laughs.Then there's "In New York". The first time I saw this on cable TV, I had to turn it off at the half way point. I always admired Ab Fab's ability to poke bold fun at guilt inducing, socially conscious agendas like eating disorders, substance abuse and disease, and the episode's immediate reference to 9-11, (Edina calls it 7-11, or is it 24-7?), is like relief from our stilted hushed post 9-11 atmosphere. But after a remarkably unfunny second half concerning Edina's attempt to locate her gay son in New York City, the program concludes with a bizarre finale as a New York bar explodes, causing burnt and charred people to spill out into the street, in a heavy reference to 9-11 that is simply disturbing. It's as if there is an inside word here, an attempt to lay blame and guilt on the causes of 9-11, that escapes me entirely. The final NYC shots of a smoke blackened Edina and Patsy being arrested while sirens wail and a building burns, as her son places a cell phone call and his lover shouts, "Do something!" seems an unhinged reference to the tragedy.But as the character Bo would say, anyhoo. Jennifer Saunders is remarkable. I'm amazed by her ability to singularly write these scripts brimming with keen absorbed observations. Often looking gawky and ill-kept as Edina, she looks particularly radiant and beautiful upon reuniting with her son and feebly attempting to accept him as a 'book' worm in "In New York". Mo Gaffney, as Bo has some of her best Ab Fab moments in both episodes, especially her paranoid escape from the scary Christian Scientists in "Ths Last Shout", and her subsequent drunken Christian rants of her days in the ministry; "...for the life of me, I could not remember the names of the four disciples, but I could remember every Osmond (brother)...".I received a very kind letter from Jon Plowman, executive producer of Ab Fab, with my last Amazon review of an Ab Fab DVD, and with all due respect, I'd like to remind producers of these packages that, at least here in America, we buy televsion series DVDs to insure an uncensored, unedited show. I hate reading in the credits that Marianne Faithful sings the title song, "Wheels On Fire", when there is no such vocal on the disc. Also, the blank space where the missing song, "The First Cut Is The Deepest" once was in "The Last Shout", is an insult to my regard for the program as a cultural icon. And, while it may be fast becoming the norm, I hate having to sit through, or fast foreword through, several minutes of BBC program promos every time I put the disc in.But I'll take Ab Fab any way I can get it.

Michael Keaton brings no distinguishing characteristics to the ghoul 'Beetlejuice', he merely acts bizarre, as does the script. It is often stunning cinematography but when the movie itself comes into focus, it's like finding one of Beetlejuice's snacks in your popcorn.

This film builds in entertainment value as it skips merrily along and possesses an unnerving quality, sure to upset the con in all of us, regarding true life famed forger Frank Abagnale Jr. being globally cornered and doggedly pursued by a determined and obsessed FBI agent. Director Steven Spielberg pictures an upscale, conservative and gaudy side of the 1960s, and DiCaprio is more than convincing as the gifted scam artist, who as Spielberg suggests, is only trying to find his way back home. Clever and amusing "Pink Panther" -like musical score by John Williams helps keep this criminal act a light-hearted affair.

Less a detective noir thriller, as reviews and promos have led me to believe, and more of a melodramatic Boston crime saga, like author Dennis Lehane's "Mystic River", with an unlikely 'surprising' conclusion crowning an otherwise dark involved drama concerning the disappearance of a four-year old Boston girl.The girl's aunt and uncle, frustrated by the police's lack of success hire a street level private investigating team, (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan), who quickly unravel a connection with the girl's disappearance and a drug king's stolen booty.Casey Affleck, directed by brother Ben, is a striking and unassuming leading player, a cross between a short John Cusack, and an adult Beaver Cleaver, and his common man characterization, all searching eyes and wiry reflexes, as he reveals a genuine familiarity with seedy Boston neighborhoods, (in real life he would have been shot a couple hundred times), is really the only redeeming factor I could find in the film. He deftly pulls off a righteousness that would seem impossible in a tough Boston private eye. Michelle Monaghan, as his partner in bed and in business, is a badly drawn character, who apparently represents only femininity, and does little else but worry the entire film. She's a dull girl Friday who would have been knocked out of the way by Miss Marple on her search for a clue.Given it's theme and one scene of a brutally molested child, the film's lesser roller coaster ride of standard detective fare is a trifle off-beat and insignificant. Twists and turns are piled as high as a pastrami on rye, and the conclusion is simply melodramatic trite, like a lesser Agatha Christie, and seems and excuse for Affleck to deliver his fine little speech on truth and dignity.If you loved Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River", you'll also love Ben Affleck's "Gone Baby Gone". If you like your crime fiction with a little less emotional bloat, and your idea of gritty realism doesn't include tortured murdered children, I suggest another round of "The Maltese Falcon".

For my money, a much better movie than the other recent underground comic book translation, &quot;American Splendor&quot;. It's about two female high school graduates who bravely confront impending adulthood in the mundane suburbs of California and it is funny without being loud and cynical without being abrasive. Probably a more precise deptction of the teen scene than the current slice of silly cinematic pie, it's a rewarding, funny thoughful film for all concerned.

Noble Prize winning mathematician John Nash's descent into schizophrenia is far more fascinating than his recovery in the heralded Ron Howard directed drama, "A Beautiful Mind". Nash's delusions, which occupy most of the first half of the film, are frightening flashes of cimematography that startle the senses into belief in much the same way a schizophrenic's delusions would. The second half of the film, his recovery, offers much less in cinematic value as Nash buries himself in mathematical equations as his delusions become less aggressive but forever present. Russell Crowe is the epitome of a schizophrenic Math professor almost to the point of amusing caricature, but the performance is disciplined excellence. Jennifer Connelly, as his wife seems merely there, no more or less than the sympathetic role offers, (I'm in the minority here). Her atrocious make-up in the final scenes, some forty years later, make her look like The Bride of Frankenstein. I would like to have seen Nash's groundbreaking work on economic theory better explained, even in layman's terms. It would have added much to his abandonment of reality. The inevitable emotional summation of Nash accepting The Noble Prize before throngs of applauding admirers was a bit anticlmactic. I mostly however enjoyed this film.

A frozen neanderthal man comes alive on a train in Russia in the early 1900s and terrorizes crew and passengers for the durarion of the film. Exceptional cast including Christopher Lee as a pioneering scientist and Telly Savalas in a bizarre role as a westerner turned Russian super-trooper. A rather ingenius wild science plotline with regards to '70s infatuation with alien theories about the origin of Earth, as suggested in such '60s-'70s pulp non-fiction like "Chariots of the Gods". Seems a bit inspired by the 1951 ckassic sci-fi, "The Thing From Another World".

Slice of war lacks a particular political point of view and instead mirrors back the American public's indifference to involvement in foreign affairs. The film is partly propagandic in painting a simple crude picture of the enemy seizing all food-care shipments from whom they perceive as their enemy. There is just not enough evidence presented to support the risk imposed in sending military special forces into Mogadishu to contain ( kidnap? kill? ) Somali dictator Muhammad Farrah Aidid. Regardless, the movie is a harrowing depiction of men in military conflict, extremely well filmed and very sad. I'm disturbed to see our American troops immortalized in this way and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; forces us to contemplate our military actions.

Sans motorcycle. It's ditched about a quarter way through the film, a 1939 Norton 500 classic called "The Mighty One".The black sputtering sleek machine, bleeding oil and begging another mile possessed a lot more rebel spirit than Che Guevara (Gael Garcia Bernal), the legendary revolutionary depicted here in this autobiographical story as a reserved young man with the budding awareness of social injustice in 1950's South America. He's a good hearted humanist and unfortunately, aside from the glare of his sympathetic heart, we never do learn what makes this infamous historical figure tick. We know he'd give you the shirt off his back, give away his last money to the needy, question the ideology of Christian missionaries swapping needed food for sermon, but when he's asked by a budding novelist to critique the work, his brutal honesty and derogative comments are treated with the reserve of noble causes as if we're to understand he's painfully truthful as well. Here Gael Garcia Bernal, more so than in Pedro Almodovar's gay oriented "Bad Education", is a bit of a real drag. "The Motorcycle Diaries" brings no face to Che Guevara. It's just a point by point filming of his writing where issues of urgency; the selfish provincialism of South American countries, the overwhelming of ingenuous peoples, are merely chapter headings in what amounts to a feeble character study. But I liked the bike. I liked the South American history and scenery. I liked his riding partner's (Rodrigo De la Serna) snaky dancing. And anyone who tops a wild three month vacation off with a visit to a leper colony already has my attention.

Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, is a cold-hearted, dramatic document mirroring unfortunate sordid headlines of today's news, in it's tragic story of a young medieval Swedish girl assaulted by a group of ruffians on her way to church. Too many real-life young girl abductions come to mind as the camera painfully reveals the aftermath of the tragedy, which starts off as innocently as a tea party with Alice in Wonderland, and ends with a disturbing, realistic visual, that remains one of the most unsettling, lurid sights ever captured on dramatic film. The two young actresses, Brigitta Pettersson, as the young victim, and Gunnel Lindblom, as her pagan worshipping stepsister, offer exemplary acting performances, and while the revenge aspect of the drama seems common, Bergman's examination of an active, involved, and strangely sympathetic Pagan religion, contrasts well with the merciless, empty sky-full of Christian belief that ends the film.

Federico Fellini's take on modern show biz stars real life wife, Giulietta Masina, (Nights of Cabiria), and Fellini mainstay, Marcello Mastroianni, (City of Women), as a former dance team reunited 30 years later for an appearance on a TV variety show. It's a funny and touching look at culture clash between the two has-beens, and a young show biz world intent on instantaneous gratification. Masina makes "Nights of Cabiria", (if you've never seen it, do so), vocal references every time she says Pippo's, (Mastroianni), name (it sounds like her cry to her lover after he tries to drown her in "Cabiria"), but even at this late stage of her acting career, Giulietta Masina seems much more capable than the soft shoe performance she offers here; aside from a youthful exhuberance at the thought of returning to the stage with her former partner, her character remains stoic. Mastroianni's character has more depth, (he's a drunk, a louse, a flirt), but the empty subplot regarding his mental health history may make him more complex, but he remains unrevealed. During the low-key Casablanca-like ending at a train station, one begins to suspect the chemistry between them goes no further than the sparks from their tapping shoes. Still, watching two of Fellini's favorite actors in what amounts to fish out of water submerged in the fast lane of superficial show biz has a dreamlike quality based in a glaring realm that is always, if nothing else, Fellini.

Although highly regarded as a superb independent film from many qualified sources including The New York Times, I found this rare, hard-to-find video to be lacking in substance and heavy on uninvolved emotional suspense. Intended primarily for a adolescent audience and derived from a popular juvenile fiction novel, it tells the story of a 15 year-old boy who struggles to learn his true identity. Given the youthful audience it targets, it is at least unconventional film-making and a think-piece for young minds who would enjoy a more intellectual slice of drama. For all it's youthfullness though, it is a dark and grim plotline and adults may be troubled by the lead character's predicament and psychological well-being. Apparently there's something here that young teenagers will absorb. Robert Wagner is very stiff and lifeless in the role of the boy's psychiatrist and Hope Lange plays an incidental character even less significant than her role as the doomed wife of Charles Bronson in &quot;Death Wish&quot;. If nothing else, &quot;I Am The Cheese&quot; is unique.

It sure sounds familiar. A Hollywood film crew causes havoc in a small American town while filming a movie. It seems they were kicked out of a previous small town due to the lead actor's (Alec Baldwin), penchant for young teenage girls. And it's deja vu all over again.What I liked about "State and Main" is it's treatment of the small town locals as being as sophisticated, savvy, and in the case ot the young teenage girl, promiscuous as the blindsided big city moviemakers, while never abandoning it's Rockwellian small town charm, or it's big city smarts. It's a perfect marriage of the two cultures clashing, never wallwoing in the expected morales and pathos of its conflict.The ensemble cast takes David Mamet's witty and clever script and flesh out the characters to sharp edged precision and humor. William H. Macy is perfectly and forgivingly corrupt as the film's director, (he'd kill a horse to make a dead horse scene look real), and Rebecca Pidgeon radiates a secure small town confidence as the local book store owner forced to abandon her plans for a community play, while setting her sights on the film's morally conflicted writer.

This movie is just begging for the folks from &quot;Mystery Science Theatre&quot; to take a seat in the front row. Killer plants from outer space terrorize Earth and dismay movie fans everywhere. How do these plants manage to stay rooted while transversing across Europe? Don't ask but they need not be plants for all their maneuverability. Why not killer frozen TV dinners from outer space? How about terrifying air freshener from Mars? The plants, kind of a cross between walking cactuses and seaweed, are finally lured away by a Spanish ice cream truck with a melody that sounds like the tune from &quot;Close Encounters of The Third Kind&quot; as sung by an out of key doorbell. It gets no better than this for lovers of bad film. Favorite line: As a scientist is dissecting a plant to learn it's origin, he screams in exasperation, &quot;Dammit, I'm not even a botanist!&quot; I howled.

Billy Idol's third solo album from 1986 is a worthy follow-up to the smash, "Rebel Yell", although with less sweeping majestic, and more stabbing, jerky guitar work from Steve Stevens, and drooling rock star Elvis/Gene Vincent vocals slobbering in echo overdub like a seductive drunk using his microphone stand to remain upright, while delivering homage to the Blueberry Hill wax museum, (Hey Baaabeeee!). You can almost smell the beer on his husky breath in the rock-star-in-a-shell revealed, "To Be A Lover". He grunts, screams, growls, and gets oh so Elvis baritone in the paranoid, music noir psyche destruction of "Don't Need a Gun", casually mentioning as if meaningfully delusional that, "the Russian roulette will fall", in a world where, "Johnney Ray is always crying". He sobers up for the pillow talk, languid, "Sweet Sixteen", a sweet and lingering "my little runaway" ode, and the all purpose melody and offbeat, "All Summer Single", has less to do with marital status, than it does the luxury a hit record can afford. I saw Idol recently in a 2005 concert comeback attempt, and dude, lose the snarl. That is so last century.

It is certainly the definitive version of Dicken's classic story. Polanski's canvas of visual depth and human population is striking. The hellish orphanage looks like the hull of an unfortunate slave ship, and the City of London is a paradox of dangerous alleyways and sky kissing church steeples. If there is a weak link, it is the young actor who plays Oliver, who seems merely a director's product, although it may be Polanski's intent to use a novice in presenting the innocence of a child. The rest of the cast is remarkably indebted to their characters.

Excellent cast, save a lackluster Dr. Watson, in a so-so Sherlock Holmes mystery based loosely on Conan Doyle's original title. The film is old and creaky and refuses the high psychological logic of Sherlock Holmes' perfect science in a few apparent plot holes, but the supporting cast is exceptional, and although star Reginald Owen's Sherlock leans a little closer to Perry Mason, he quite fits the shoes of the famed detective.

Late '60s, early '70s band from Flint, Michigan came up from the ranks of self promotion and constant touring to establish themselves as America's favorite hard rock party band. So with Grand Funk classics like the hard rock bluesy "Heartbreaker", would be prog pretty, "Closer To Home", and later successful hits like the airplay aplenty, "Some Kind Of Wonderful", and the Little Eva remake, "Loco-Motion", why does this live recording from 1975 sound as lifeless as a dormant railroad track, and as tiring as an after-party Tylenol? Could be that the band was losing it's appeal as their total output proved the party was chaperoned by a desperate attempt to remain on track with super produced hit singles rendering the band's original American sound anonymous. The uninspired drum solo is here as is an indifferent three minute treatment of the Todd Rundgren produced big hit single, "We're An American Band", which the band merely checks off their song list, as if impatient to get it out of the way, while "The Railroad" offers a gentler and heavier Grand Funk as a hard working class blues oriented rock band. The earlier "Grand Funk Live Album" is the one to get, showcasing this suburban teenage no-future spirit before the spoils of success.

Comprehensive 2 DVD package chronicling the arrival in 2004 of Beach Boys' Brian Wilson's "Smile" album, that legendary hushed secret rumored to be as grand as "Sgt. Pepper", uncerimoniously leaked over the years in bootleg recordings, and finally laid to rest as an impossible dream, a rock and roll fantasy on a par with a complete Beatles reunion. In 1967 the world grooved to Beach Boys' classic, "Good Vibrations", but the album which it heralded never arrived, abandoned by Wilson after costing him a chunk of mental well-being, as he found himself in artistic arrest, unable to iron out what he felt were imperfections to his masterpiece. He stuffed his production on a shelf somewhere and strolled away, from the album, and indeed from life. It only took therapy, a supportive new wife, and maybe a kilo of anti-depressants to lure Wilson from self exile and complete the album, 37 years after the fact. This DVD package, a documentary leading up to and including the unveiling of the complete "Smile" performed in London in 2004, and the complete album itself performed in Surfin' City USA, L.A., is a Beach Boys lovers wet California dream come true. The reclusive Wilson is seen like a fish reentering water, enthusiastically speaking of the history of "Smile", (Did anybody care after 37 years?), and his life and career; he tells of a young Beach Boys earliest recordings gaining popularity as they repeatedly called a local radio station requesting their record. He is unassuming and confident, fragile and artistically obsessed, indeed taking "Smile" back into the recording studio cost him at least one more hospital visit, which was abruptly ended when his wife asked nonchalantly if he'd rather go out for dinner. He's keenly aware, and befuddled by the awe he inspires in his peers, and becomes frustrated with the reproduction of the album, expressing temperament, (and love), with studio musicians, and is totally unimpressed when Paul McCartney and other rock royalty visits him backstage just before the premier of "Smile". The only thing missing here, and it seemed vital with everyone and their brother offering insight into Wilson, is the surviving Beach Boys', (Mike Love), input on the reemergence of "Smile". Maybe they chose not to indulge, and if so, it was a grave error not to be in support of this historical footnote. Lest I forget the thing itself, the album "Smile" is wonderful, with lyrics by Van Dyke Parks, music by Brian Wilson, it is a resounding last surfer wave banging against the beach, a celebration of American pop music and it's attempt to lead the masses into a brighter tomorrow. But it is not so much the album that inspires and warms the heart, which it certainly does. It is the fact that Wilson finally delivered "Smile" to the music world and his fans, when all hope was long dashed.

The five members of Yes are profiled and speak casually to the camera about the longevity of the band and it's future. Video and audio concert bites make one hungry for a complete Yes show, and the whole purpose of this three hour documentary seems to be an incentive to purchase a ticket the next time Yes roll into town. Still, it's refreshing to see this elusive band letting their hair down and revealing themselves to the camera. Drummer Alan White, often the most subdued Yes-man, comes across as the more personable and reflective member, looking bright-eyed and healthful, speaking from his recreational boat somewhere in northwest America. The photography of the disc, although little more than following them around on tour, and recording them in their homes, is sharp and vivid, and the audio concert is exceptional, as we can expect from Yes. The narration from paycheck hungry (?) Roger Daltry is awful, sounding like a Monty Python bit straining to be heard over the documentary soundtrack. And I hate to mention it, but these guys can't dress. They collectively look like they're wearing the results of a crash landing in a colorful hot air balloon.

It was discouraging to read disparaging remarks here on Amazon concerning censored segments in the 5th season DVD collection of "Absolutely Fabulous", because I noticed a rude editing job during what was apparently a missing "Chicago" parody, and Deborah Harry is credited with singing the theme song which, here, is an instrumental. Strange, because I sort of liked the organ blues melancholy sound of the new instrumental theme until I realised it was in lieu of Deborah Harry's vocals. I don't like watching the show on the Oxygen cable network because there is a lack of respect for the program with crass, indiscriminate commercial interruption and an inferior video quality. So it seems it is only a matter of cost saving that these segments are missing, and it is ironic that a show which so boldly mocks greed in capitalism would find itself victimized by it. Even that though, can't stop me from singing the praises of Jennifer Saunders, creator, star and writer of the series. "Absolutly Fabulous" still stands alone in the American television wasteland as sharp social satire that manages to retain that essential element of the best sitcoms - a heart. In our cardboard cut-out, eternally politically dull sitcom saturated TV, it is a sigh of relief to find comfort, warmth, and familiarity in an alcoholic, a drug addict, insincere Christian born-agains, and the like of a more real modern life. And the program always looks so good, with bold colors, elaborate sets, and constant movement like a gentle heart beating frantically. At near the end of this collection, I was very worried that a beloved character had actually expired. That I could care about any fictional character on TV as deeply as I did watching this, is testement to the fine craft of this program. But first and foremost, this show is just so (darn) funny.

2 CD German import album with twenty dance house gems, successfully fusing old school with new, you won't know where '70s soul ends and '90s trip-house begins. Isaac Haye's cool, urban movie anthem, "Theme from 'Shaft', (Sash! Extended Mix)", with it's city smarts downbeat of fluid bass and Rocky-fly-now horn section, crawling down the street like a new jewelled Cadillac, stands alongside the likes of Pizzaman's unisex, hypnotic "Gottaman", and the siren wailing disco fire fright of, Morel Inc.'s "Are You Ready To Play The Game". CDK's "I'm Your Boogie Man", yes that SAME song you punched off the radio in the ''I Hate Disco" '70s, that got stuck in your head like a nail, sounds almost meaningful in it's new production shoes, likewise, Joey Negro's "Can't Get Higher Without U", has matured like a bottle of buried wine in it's 'Hysteria Dub', with congo popping percussion, dance begging bass, and swirling mono-stereo manipulation. Eartha Kitt's clubmix "Where Is My Man" sounds as fine today as it did when it graced the airwaves in the '80s, and yes that's Eartha Kitt, the same pop vocalist of 78rpm records of the '50s, and the hottest Catwoman ever seen , in TV's '60s shlock series, "Batman". As the kids have said, and the rest of us enjoy repeating, "It's all good". Twenty luscious long tracks with that smooth stereo dream-like soundscape, dancing with your mind as well as your feet, a hard but patient sound, so absent in today's cluttered and dreary rock music. This CD package lets you absorb the past while facing the future. And don't bother pulling the car over to the side of the road. That siren you hear wailing from all directions is coming from the speakers.

Balancing a rough and gentle set, Genesis's "Wind and Wuthering", is a prog rock melancholy celebration, and love, like for a bad child, of staunch European lone star England, with nods to it's aristocratic past, (Eleventh Earl Of Mar), it's Protestant 'work 'till you die' ethics, (One For The Vine), and it's current aggressive and perfunctory political state, (Blood On The Rooftops). With Phil Collins at the helm, the lyrics are just shy of Peter Gabriel's (gone solo), metaphoric wizardry, but Collins does paint a haunting imagery of merry old England, like comparing the writings of very British but layman, Arthur Conan Doyle with the more literary Charles Dickens, they both excel in their given genres. The music is almost all Tony Banks controlling most of the album, delivering waves and washes of synthisized keyboards, giving it a low-key Baroque-like flavor, and the album breaks, in a very satisfying relief in the final track, "Afterglow", with Collins' ode to love seeming the last testement and property of his beloved England. It's all a more minor, but absolute Genesis music, and although you can't dance to it, thankfully, it can send you soaring. The album contains the dead-beat, mass appeal hit single, "Your Own Special Way", which should have been sold to Peter Frampton.

INXS's big, showy album from 1985, finds the late Michael Hutchence leading his band through agreeable, if a bit pat pop construction, which in retrospect, is a bit choppy and nerve ridden, like a constant hiccup, with belches of guitars cutting a sharp chord for hook's sake, bass vibrating like something funkadelic, and drums never veering from a rock beaten path. What was exciting in 1985 sounds routine today. "This Time Will Be The Last Time", still holds it's ground as snazzy pop harmonics, and "Falling Down The Mountain", is still an Aussieland-Appalachian misty folkish dream, but the rest of it, well, it's only rock 'n roll.

Oddball English film with a quaint setting of two elderly sisters living in a grand old seaside cottage in the 1930s, who discover a young man washed ashore from an apparent shipwreck. The movie has an annoying device of plodding along without revealing any details of the young man, even after he becomes a resident of the sisters' home and a familiar member of the community. Is he amnesiac? Married? Where is he from? As if under a directional insistance, these questions are never answered and do not seem to be a concern of anyone involved. He apparently simply came from the sea. What appears to be a microphone boom hanging from the top of one scene in the cottage suggest these apparent flaws in the film have a purpose, but by reel's end, the renewal of sexual feelings from one of the sisters towards the young man, is the only dramatic pull working here, and knowing little about the woman's history, this romantic angle comes off as a bit ridiculous. There are fine character portraits of the village and it's people, and the cinematic touches of manipulated camera work are graceful but beguiling, in that contrast of color and scheme, sudden camera stops and slow motion effect do not make the story or meaning any clearer. Still, there is a haunting hook to this film, the heavy-handed flaws are so apparent, I wonder if it's just an upsetting little dream of spinsters nearing the end of their lives.

When we first see Rosalba, the constrained fortysomething wife and mother on a dull vacation with her family in her native Italy, she is an unattractive awkward tourist with a black fanny pack revealing a drooping middle-aged spread, clumsily carrying bags of gawky souvenirs, while not having the time of her life on a bus trek through Italian historic relics. Somewhere along her independent journey, when she misses the bus while detained in a tourist stop restroom, actress Licia Maglietta transforms her character into an eye-popping, sexually exciting woman with an alluring expression of desire and maternal warmth, while doing little else than losing the fanny pack. Ah, that's amore! What a nice, non-abrasive film this is, offering not so much a feel-good response as it does a more satisfying glow of hearts yearning and emotional contentment.

Quite exhilerating, stark, simple yet complex marimba musical arrangements by 20th Century (and 21st) composer Steve Reich is wonderful to even this progressive rock fan who admittedly hasn't had much exposure to this type of music. The musical nucleus of this centripetal web keeps the listener transfixed on a musical point that grows, wavers, momentarily disappears and returns with renewed intensity causing the listener to stare into the insistent sound as if by gunpoint, helplessly hypnotized and bondaged towards a finale. Rather mind boggling at times it's not recommended for in your car listening. You're liable to find yourself cruising down a road that didn't exist before you got there.

If you like Jack London's The Call of The Wild, then you'll probably love this internationally cast, (dubbed, save Charlston Heston) and earnest adaptation of the classic fiction with shanghied german shepherd, Buck, sold into the 19th Century Yukon dog trade, where he finds guidance and companionship in dog sled mail rider, John, (Heston). What appears to be a small budget for the film, does remarkably well in capturing the crude and bawdy Yukon gold rush boom towns, and the genuinely wintery and snowy northern wilderness. The film pulls no punches in delivering the violent aspects of the book, (the dog trade is crude and ugly), and animal star, Buck, (as himself, the credits say), would make Lassie proud.

The songs seem designed around the sparse but dominating pop hooks that serve as melodic pitstops to Costello's dark, new album, &quot;When I Was Cruel&quot;. He seems to chide the new youthful generation of popular music tastes in &quot;Cut Off Your Own Head (It's A Doll Revolution)&quot;, and on the title song he stands alone among failed peers and salivating starlets as if witnessing a phenomenal but faddish pop act spectacle under the glittering silver ball dance light of Abba's &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. This is not as surfacey consuming and exhausting as some of his recent work and the musical depth and crevices of &quot;When I Was Cruel&quot; could take several months to explore.

Imperial Teen constitutes that teen-hood than eerily elevates itself above all others. You know the one, the kid dressed in black and leather, mysterious and dark, maybe a 'kill the teacher' t-shirt, selling hard drugs at his school locker, wild stories about drug score journeys to distant places, layers and layers of frightening sexual appetite eying all as you trot off to English class, some talk that he killed one of his relatives. And then you hook up with him, and he's just another weakling screwed-up jerk, and probably gay. And brain sap is drooling out of his ears.Carry on, wayward imperial teen. Take that crown of thorns and turn it into a masochist's daydream. Graduate, (unlikely, he's never been to gym class), or drop out, and go get some,- "Bow down to me, bow down, yeah, baby, baby", and then spit it out,- "You're not qualified, you're not what I employ", from "Water Boy". Go home again after you taste the freedom of life outside your parent's home,- "I'm not dressed for this climate, someone take me to the mall", from "Blaming The Baby", but that's no good because it's good to hate your parents,- "I crashed the family limosine, I drove to feel the drive, the chauffer's dead my mother said, and you're the only one alive.", from "Luxury", so get out man,- "I left my home and family, they still don't know I'm gone, I'm looking for a family, that listens to my songs." Just don't make them listen to a song called, "Imperial Suicide".All set to the pop jingle, guitar slashing indie rock a guy like you would suddenly realize is cooler than metal.

What do I think of director Ron Howard telling ME about poverty, in depicting World Title Boxing champ James Braddock's struggle to feed and support his family during the American financial depression of the 1930s? His relentless grim picture of hungry children with bronchrial coughs in cold city tenements is like finding a razor blade in an apple off The Walton's family tree. Times are tough all over, but you gotta do what you gotta do, even if you tearfully promised your son, on word of honor, that you'd never split up the family. I think Howard wrung an emotionally soaking wet rag dry, just to set us bleeding heart saps up for the exhilerating ride to the rewarding, climactic world title boxing match. Starting off like a morality play, typical of the era, with ragged parents on snowy city streets looking for food for their family, the movie then uses the violent, blood-spitting sport of boxing as the only cultural alternative to both the hopelessness of the depression, and the cynical and maudlin voice of the media of the day. A happy ending to a dumb drama might help depression audiences cheer up a bit, but seeing a guy punch the living daylights out of an established, cocky world boxing champ, will send them out into the streets roaring with approval. Ron Howard's extravagant, artsy camera work only enhances the film; the stop action camera flashes during boxing bouts nail home the graceful strategies of boxing, Russell Crowe walking down a city street while all around him becomes a blurred image, conveys well the character's deepening isolation. The leads and supporting cast are excellent, the historic details are meticulous, blah, blah, blah, but it's the horrific edge of World Boxing Champ Max Baer, he killed some guys in the ring, played by Craig Bierko, that gives the film reason to rally around the hero and strike up a round of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'.

This is a very sweet, not maudlin, film of a brother and sister relationship forever bonded by love and familial obligation. Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo are convincing and likable as siblings who share a traumatic childhood which matures them to the responsible (Linney) and irresponsible (Ruffalo) adults they've become. For being a so called 'art movie' which played in the smaller theatrical houses, it is surprisingly lightweight comedy-drama, never very demanding but engrossing nonetheless, amusing and touching. Rory Culkin playing Linney's 8 year-old son delivers an accomplished wry performance as the child at the center of the sibling's storm center. Although much different in dramatic content, I'm reminded of Martin Scorsese's, (credited here as a producer), &quot;Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore&quot;, in it's similar folksy realistic view of the nuclear American family.

In the dead of winter, I looked through my book shelf, and found a copy of A SUMMER PLACE. The smash hit theme song from the movie version rolled through my head, lulling me into a comfy chair, a hot coffee, and an electric blanket, and in no time, I was immersed in this story of young love renewed and young love discovered. It's been years since I've seen the movie, and I can't say I even remember it, (Sandra Dee? Troy Donahue?), but I was surprised to find the summer place of the title a series of summer places, like a Floridian beach house, an aging Maine coastal inn, and even the sights and sounds of Buffalo, New York, (where I hail), and indeed, like Buffalo in winter, the summer place of the book is a place of the mind.It's a complicated and dramatic love affair concerning two generations revolving around a historic summer inn on a Maine island. Two teenage camp counselors fall in love and eventually marry, while their male friend, a clumsy and disliked camp counselor, and the butt of all jokes and pranks, has to relinquish his lust for the spoken for girl, but not until he rapes her in a semi-consensual night on the beach. Years pass and the clumsy teen councelor is now a successful rich businessman, married with two young girls, and still harboring a desire for his old friend. He books a vacation at the inn one summer, knowing his childhood friends have bought and manage the old inn. When the son of couple number one meets the daughter of couple number two, the summer gets that much hotter.Author Sloan Wilson creates convincing and sympathetic chacarcterizations, as the middle aged couples' mistakes and regrets, longings and desires, are brought full circle as the young affair blooms before them. In the teenagers in love, he clearly draws the insecurities and private worlds of young minds. Lovingly realized characters, a decent Romeo and Juliet plot, and a mature delving into the psyche of sexuality and commitment, make A SUMMER PLACE, a book well worth reading. Not to mention a summer breeze rolling in off the ocean in the dead of winter in Buffalo.

I don't know anything about the movie this soundtrack is based on, but this collection of songs is like a great late '90s hard rock mix tape, full of gloomy, ominous, hopeful and deadly, high profile artists and songs. The Frankenstein experiment gone wrong in Prodigy's "Poison" is dramatic and fun listening, Everlast's "So Long" got some bad publicity as allegedly being a song obsessed by a certain high school killer, it is truly less menacing, being a beautiful rock ballad about the results of bullying, Guns N' Roses' "Oh My God" successfully fuses old school rock with a nu metal heartbeat, Eminem's cocky "Bad Influence" attempts reverse psychology in an anti-suicide social statement, the more alternative Sonic Youth breezes along in their traditional rhythm and guitar chaos in "Sugar Kane", Korn's big production in "Camel Song" is like an upheaval of late '90s radio, Limp Bizkit's "Crushed" leans on funk, pop, and The Steve Miller Band in a weird jangle song structure, Rob Zombie's "Superbeast Girl On a Motorcycle Mix" sounds like a high school marching band fully geared for war. Twelve tracks in all, these songs sound like they belong together, hard rock with a heart, a halo, and a gun.

Woody Allen has managed to combine true belly laughs with heartfelt emotional conflicts in this modern movie classic which remains as satisfying today as it was when it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Too often confused with being episodic or out of a chronilogical order, &quot;Annie Hall&quot; expresses found and lost love and all the mental juxtapositions that come with it.

Welsh playwright, author, actor, Emlyn Williams, (1905-1987), the writer of "The Corn Is Green", and "Night Must Fall", and cast in several films including Alfred Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn" (1939), has confessed to possessing a passion for real life murder. Before penning his classic play of the macabre, "Night Must Fall", he labored over courtroom transcripts of murder trials, and based his first big sucess on a real life murder.So it is no wonder that his 1968 classic true crime book, "Beyond Belief, A Chronicle of Murder and Its Detection", an account of the infamous child murders in mid 1960's Britain, known as the Moors Murders as two bodies were unearthed on the English moors, is rich in eloquent passages worthy of a poet, while the horrendous crimes are cautiously treated with reverence and a debt of sorrow by a writer who surely knows his way around a corpse.Between 1963 and 1965, a young working class British couple, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, (he languishes in prison to this day, she died in prison in 2002), killed at least five young people varying in ages from 10 to 17, for apparently no other reason than the sadistic thrill it gave them. Two of the murders were verified after the publication of this book. The children were lured into a car with the promise of a ride home, viciously murdered and buried in the vast lonely English moors. A 17 year old young man was hacked to death in the couple's suburban kitchen.William's book builds suspense like a thick low fog over the moors with fiction-like writing, rich in rural English colloquialisms that sometimes defy American translation, as he channels the speech patterns and minds of the British working class, and savors the impending doom of quiet English towns and children walking alone at night. So much so that halfway through the book, intrigue and impatience got the best of me and I had to look up the details of the crimes on the internet. And while the first half is like a long slow frightening climb up a roller coaster hill, the second half races frantically downward in startling detail as the police slowly piece together an unlikely scenario that surprisingly brings closure to long lost missing children.If you enjoy real life crime books, Beyond Belief is especially fine due to the assured writing talent of Williams. Given the horrific details of the crimes, he is trustingly sensitive and shields us from true horrific exposure with an almost Dickensian kindness.

If I were a CIA agent and the man I was interviewing and investigating walked to an open window and paged through a book, I would immediately know that he was signalling a contact. Not the CIA agent in this movie. He nearly single-handedly captures himself. Sure, Michael Caine is fine with 'character' chiseled on his mature fine lined face but he's surrounded by a lot of clap-trap that reeks of dated romantic adventure fiction from years gone by. The intriguing premise of American CIA operatives in pre-war Vietnam is too singularly entwined in a love triangle that remains confused and inconclusive and somehow cold-hearted. The political espionage is simple and barely thought provoking in its depiction of the CIA as anything but a noble force. There is no excusing the character of Phoung as the female love interest who is throughout, the depiction of stereotypical American bias of a 'pretty Asian woman', a demure mindless geisha of a girl you expect to see serve tea at any moment while delivering a foot massage. Big sweeping musical score doesn't enhance the film, it impounds it. A big disappointment.

Maybe in the future we'll be able to wake up in the morning, press rewind and watch our dreams on our dream recording machine. Until then, we have filmmakers like Bob Dylan, who have the accessibility to monstrously construct the elaborate and profound thought process they have experienced. How can such a cold and lifeless movie come from such a warm and gracious artist? As a visual feast to Dylan's most recent work, it manages to exclude his entire heart. Great sound and extraordinary soundtrack does not a movie make.

This film isn't deserving of the controversy it created in depicting Asian American teenagers involved in petty crime which escalates into heavier criminal activity. No, this film is guilty of much more. Just when it has walked the plankboard of typical high school teen angst as depicted in scores of other minority based films, it then jumps into the cold water relying on 'hammer to the head' dramatic shock value to give the aimless narrative some direction. Aside from this violent murder scene that the movie seems to celebrate, this is really dull stuff, like watching the kids from TV's &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; walking down an endless school corridor sporting guns under their belts. The dramatic hook at the beginning of the film is a tremendous letdown by movie's end. &quot;Better Luck Tomorrow&quot; is tough luck today.

I can't say I know Shakespeare very well, certainly never knew "The Merchant of Venice", (which I would have guessed was one of his lighter comedies), so I was unprepared for the difficulty in digesting this Jew vs. Christian drama which simply smacks of anti-semitism, despite it's lofty and high minded ideals. The sight of a Jewish man merely, albeit outrageously securing the conditions of a debt in a court of law and being threatened, nearly condemned to death, and reduced to a Rumplestilskin-like troll under a bridge, by a person posing as an influential leader, who holds a tremendous bias in the outcome of the case, is a discomforting and ugly situation. The film was only wavering with cinematic interest until this bombshell dropped; ellaborate settings and costumes, immaculate acting, well plotted conflict, musical score by Jocelyn Pook, ("Eyes Wide Shut"), but what is it we're supposed to learn about the merchant of Venice? That in order to learn the sanctity of forgiveness, he needs to become a Christian? Here is a comedy with a very cynical laugh, a tragedy where no one dies. Assuming this is an accurate vision of the essence of the play, the old man wasn't so far removed from his own generation's fears and prejudices.

The pajama factory setting is a little awkward and it doesn't really jive with the spirited song and dance numbers, which are constatly splendid. When the whole factory goes on a company picnic, you know this Broadway musical longs to be as big as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, but is constrained by the very little framework of a labor dispute in a clothing factory. Still, you may be surprised to find the host of wonderful recognizable songs that originated from this musical, the cast is exceptional, and if you like Doris Day, well, you may find yourself in 'que-sera-sera' heaven.

I can't help but think of all the people going into this film expecting to see a scary monster. The only scary monster is the hyped up advertising which seems to promise fear, scare, and psychological suspense beyond belief. More like boredom beyond compare. I've seen this story of an Amish-type society building a rural utopian dream only to be threatened by the same social element it ran from many times before, but never so massively produced and pretentiously executed as it is in this pseudo-intellectual, swath of artistic pomp. Your worst fears do come true here when absolutely nothing happens and the red herrings grow to the size of whales. And how does Adrien Brody manage to play a village idiot without any character whatsoever?

Here is a thorough collection of not only the greatest hits of &quot;The 5th Dimension&quot; but their lesser hits as well which have been difficult to find in one package. This colorful 2-disc volume includes a 23 page booklet of the band's history and vintage photos of the group including their performances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the original album covers. Despite the history of childhood friends noted here, &quot;The 5th Dimension&quot; were probably a producer's creation, brought together to turn the record company owned &quot;Up, Up, and Away&quot; into a hit single. But, oh, what beautiful music that creation ensued. With songs by such successful writers as Jimmy Webb, Laura Nyro, and Burt Bacharach, &quot;The 5th Dimension&quot; roared through Top 40 radio in the late '60s and early '70s with their light symphonic pop and soul melodic hooks and harmonies that were just shy of &quot;The Carpenter's&quot; blandness and a bit more conservative than Sly Stone. All the big numbers are here but so are less successful singles omitted today from retro oldies radio and deserving of attention. Laura Nyro's &quot;California Soul&quot; is a splendid, sweet psychedelic ode to the California hippie movement with soaring group harmonies and a cool blues electric piano. Jimmy Webb's &quot;Carpet Man&quot; finds the whole group contributing playful, swirling call and response pop vocals to a catchy rock and roll beat, it's a great forgotten hit single that reached #29 on Billboard's charts. &quot;Light Sings&quot;, from the Broadway musical &quot;The Me Nobody Knows&quot; is as joyful and celebratory as their biggest hit, &quot;Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine In (The Flesh Failures). The 5th Dimension, in their corporate string of best selling records, may not be the grooviest institution to come out of the '60s, but they very well may be the sweetest.

This is the last book in the nature series by Helen Hoover chronicling her and her husband's sixteen years in a small cabin in the Northern Minnesota wilderness. With fine pen and ink illustrations by Ade Hoover, the book is a modern day &quot;Walden&quot; as Helen and Ade cope with the ways of the wilderness after leaving prestigious jobs in the Chicago steel industry for a life that affords none of the comforts of modern living. High-brow readers and scientific minds will cringe with suppressed delight as The Hoovers study the natural world by feeding it, comforting it, and befriending any wayward creature that happens through their cabin door. If you like nature writing with a tinge of sentiment or if you ever imagined getting away from it all and living in a cabin in the woods, you will find this book and the entire series essential and delightful reading.

Illegal African immigrant in London finds a human heart in the plumbing of a city hotel room where he works the night desk. Intriguing beginning propels the relevant, and both tragic and comedic story forword with layers of dynamic social commentary concerning the plight of unfortunate lives in underground London. For me though, the ending tainted severely the grim yet promising flavor of the film. The recipient of a very dastardly deed is one of the unfortunates the film alleges to sympathise with, however ruthless and criminal minded he is. That the 'just rewards' aren't targeted at a more prominent level of this sad social scale, from outside the underground, left the story a human microcosm devouring itself. That, and a tearfully murmured 'I love you' in an airport near film's end, as if from another film entirely, left me feeling unhinged. Chop off the final 20 minutes and it's a near perfect touching social comment and a wonderful movie.

After awhile, Ray Charles starts sounding like a spokesperson for 'Travel in America' as each 19 songs on this CD speak of hittin' the road and visiting, not the musical road less travelled, but the swinging nightclubs and hot spots where Steve and Eydie Gormet may be the opening act. We're reminded what a great hit single, &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;, was, an explosion of anger at the heat of a romantic conflict as the vocals scream and demand in two part melody. The first twelve songs are the original tracks from his 1959 album, &quot;The Genius of Ray Charles&quot;, and the transfer to CD has left them sounding a little hollow like Charles is singing from another room. One suspects the vocals were sung over at the time this album was compiled. The Bonus Tracks are much better but hey! did I say something negative about this cool laid-back groovy album? You have to hear the half spoken/half vocal call and response of &quot;New York's My Home&quot;, as Charles grinds his gravelly voice over his blues/pop piano and wins any argument against New York City. &quot;Georgis On My Mind&quot; is also here and a less grave &quot;Rainy Night In Georgia&quot;, where Charles even hiccups over a drink in the fade out of the vocal tracks. Now that's casual.

The gimmick here; a resteraunt conversation that offers two variations of the story of a girl named Melinda, seems an after the fact remedy to a very weak script. The conversation cuts in throughout the film, serving as narration to the stories of Melinda, a rather non-descript, insubstancial person who drags the film terribly whenever she has a story to tell. The cast is almost uniformly insecure in their roles. In contrast, the film ignites, for only a moment, as one of the storytellers; a lovely brunette who had the same sort of role in Allen's "Hollywood Ending", simply 'takes the stage' as she compares the concepts of comedy and tragedy. Why not more of her, or more of that? I can't help but think of the first Woody Allen film I ever saw. As kids we used to camp out in tents in each other's yards in the summer, stay up late and watch black and white late night TV. One night, quite unexpectedly, "What's Up Tiger Lilly?" came on a late movie, and we roared and howled with laughter, so much that neighbors called the cops. Now I don't expect to find myself laughing like a delirious 13 year-old, but I find myself instead, after a new Woody Allen film, a muttering indignant adult, very much like the critic complaining in the movie line in "Annie Hall". Oh well, there's always next year.

This film is padded with pretentious film gimmickry to disguise the commonplace and crude story of a sensational axe murder revealed here in a blood-splattering flashback climax. Characters interchange personas, appear to be two places at once, and are edited in a flashy style to lend credance to their obsession of a true-life murder that happened off the coast of New Hampshire in 1873. The two modern couples exploring the historic incident exchange romantic intrigue with each other to no avail and are at times very stupid, as in the climax when they're running from an impending hurricane like they're being chased by Dorothy's tornado. Still, the film has a becoming salty sea air about it. The pristine blue sky, dark ocean, and modern white sailboat contrast well with the smutty murder being investigated and the flashback scenes to 19th Cenrury American immigrants are far more absorbing than the Playboy Centerfold-like beach babes and guys investigating them. With true-life axe murders and 19th Century life on an island off the coast of New Hampshire in mind, the film is flawed and irresistible.

It tries to make much of the boyish and coy rivalry of indie rock bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, and The Dandy Warhols, but the admiration one puts on the other soon becomes trite, and what emerges is an irrelevant and entertaining study of the two bands as they merge and cross paths. They are about as similar as The Beatles and The Spice Girls, but the documentary works as a whole, as it would if nearly anybody, say, Billy Idol, walked in and joined the mix. Anton Newcombe, of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, is a bona fide eccentric, borderline nutcase rock star, and although it may be true, as Dandy Warhol's lead, Courtney Taylor says in the aftermath of the production, that he's really a nice guy, but a very bad drunk, he still looks like a total (any expletive word will do), as he kicks a fan in the head for a mild catcall during a show, lays claim and emotional fervor to a newborn son, kicks back on heroin highs, and chases The Dandys around in a revealing confusion of publicity and emotional longing. He is the single most fascinating aspect of the documentary, a reckless and unhinged true artist, and a very bad drunk, and without him there is a much lesser film. It's hysterical to hear the voice-over of Brian Jonestown Massacre's representative, as she explains the night she gathered top record company executives in a club to hear the band perform, and secure them a major recording contract, based on the positive industry buzz they were receiving. What happens after she says, "it couldn't have been worse", is the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long time.

If you used to say, you only watch this TV show because it's on before "Dallas",and you always watch Dallas, c'mon, fess up! You love "The Dukes of Hazzard". You love Daisy Duke, The General Lee, moonshine, Uncle Jesse, and you think the Waylon Jennings theme song is just about the best damn song ever written. You can name the character cousins who replaced Bo and Luke Duke during their brief contract dispute with CBS, (the question stumped me during a recent Trivial Pursuit bout). You said a silent prayer when you heard two of the series stunt drivers were killed during a filming of one of the episodes, ending with, 'that great dirt back road in the sky'. You owned a Dukes of Hazzard T-shirt, the board game, official '69 Charger model kit, and you periodically check the secondary market of your Dukes of Hazzard lunch box.This movie loves the Dukes too. The cameras treat The General, that legendary orange '69 Charger, like a star in a fashion shoot, with long, loving, slow-motion shots and spectacular flying sequences, not only over country creeks, but highflying like a witch on a broom over highways in downtown Atlanta. Yee-Haw! There's more love here than a possum in springtime. A minor beloved character smiles directly into the camera after his bit, and who would have imagined that Daisy Duke's short shorts could become shorter? I can reluctantly admit that all essential characters, and then some, are accounted for, and the script is taken directly from episodes of the series, particularly the one about the successful hometown Hazzard boy who comes home to win the big race.The movie Dukes are a little dumber than TV's clean-cut Bo and Luke. Seann William Scott, as Bo, conveys a perfect simple-minded, big-hearted, gearhead country bumpkin, and Johnny Knoxville, aside from some lame and gratuitous stunt work, manages to fulfill the character, even with a wavering put-upon southern accent. The funniest role belongs to Kevin Hefferman as conspiracy minded, schizophrenic good ole boy, Sheev, who wears an armadillo shell on his head to block secret messages from the CIA. Jessica Simpson, as the leggy Daisy Duke, admits in the DVD extras that she only has to stand around and look good, and she does that well enough. The only grave disappointment is law enforcement bungling baddies, Roscoe and Boss Hogg, characters demanding broad slapstick are given careless and indifferent no-cigar treatment.So kick your shoes off, set down ahwile, the DVD extras reveal a dismantled and controlled General Lee, but dreams of a '69 Charger never die. When the sequel comes around, you'll be there faster than a polecat chased up a tree.

Jets to Brazil's Blake Schwarzenbach, with his nasal cold and fake British Elvis Costello-like accent, writes testimonies of love unfulfilled like he's sitting in a stoned haze, lifting his eyes momentarily out of the warm mist, looking around, and returning, dismayed, but not discouraged, to the sheltering comfort of his nothing, protected world, where you'll find a poet's grace for the perfect sentiment, ("If I cried a river for you, would you swim in it some sunny afternoon?"), cosmic imagery, ("Do the stars conspire to kill us off with loneliness?"), lazy guitar fueled summery ballads, ("summer dress your hair's wet, and gets into our kisses"), and sharp hooks and riffs so simply manipulative you'll feel tinges of guilt hitting the repeat button on a guitar riff that even The Knack would reject as too common, ("Little Light"). It's an addictive, melodic, and even companionable album, like comfort from a friend whose love life is so screwed up , you feel that much better about your own.

Eloquent and strange film about two female comatose patients and their respective partners who wait, administer nurturing care, and indeed, 'talk to her'. This film is laid out like an inviting satin bed sheet with seductive comfort zones and gorgeous sexual images; you won't soon forget Rosario Flores decked out in her bullfighter garb, until more fundamental plot developments disturb the sedate quality in the second half. The Romeo and Juliet-like denouncement seemed beneath the film's objective, but the final moments are stirring and the use of subtitles, especially at the end where love is the silent communicator, is very moving.

This is one of those movies you've heard so much about and are thoroughly disappointed by. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is almost Gidget in it's simple pansy story about Rolling Stone Magazine's cub reporter Cameron Crowe in the early '70s. The music isn't even relevant of it's day but are even older radio hits. This kid really began to ware on me. I kept wating for something, anything to happen.

Some of Janis Ian's wordplay could make a bad poet blush. Take this line from her adolescent hell signature song, "At Seventeen", a tune betrayed by this bizarre description of teenage alienation, "Their small town eyes will gape at you, (gaping eyes?), in dull surprise when payment due, succeeds accounts received at seventeen". How's that, a teenage accountant? Or this from, "Tea and Sympathy", "Pass the tea and sympathy, for the good old days are long gone, we'll drink a toast to those, who most believe in what they've won." Never have I wanted to drink a toast to those, who most believe in what they've won. But just when you want to file these feminist minded, man-eating compositions under aimless testements, Ian slam bangs the finish with two monumental orchestrated numbers questioning the choice between laying down to the death of a lifetime with your lover, or the freedom artistic pursuit and single-hood can offer, making all her previous meandering diatribes sound meaningful. Here the album stands up and says hello, and the crescendoing climax calls you back for another listen. Some nice touches here and there as well, including a brooding cello solo at the end of, "Water Colors".

Fluid and dreamy but not without a pop beat sensibility, England's 'Suede' sails a romantic ferry across the Mersy with inspirations of Smiths, Bowie and Ray Davies along as passengers in this 27 track double CD compilation. Brett Anderson has a personable, emotional singing style and although the lyrics lack much depth his tidy and refined songs are heart-felt and often striking in a folk-goth-rock minstrel way. Guitarist Richard Oakes lays down some flashy superb rock tracks without causing much corrosion to the pretty tapestry.

After the first 90 minutes, I was about to stop watching and save this six hour HBO miniseries for another rainy day. When Meryl Streep arrives in New York City from her Mormon homeland, to visit her son and question his strange behavior, the film improves considerably. She brings a much needed point of view to what has already been established as an ensemble of unlikeable characters threatened by the AIDS virus during the epidemic's early stages of development. Not that Streep's character doesn't tow her own worldly baggage, but her ordinary yet not unquestioning life contrasts well with the troubled complications of the other characters. She's like a sigh of relief when all else is bated breath. Somewhere deeply involved in the second half, I had to ask myself if I'm enjoying the film because of the creativity involved or is this merely a good soap opera? And were the surreal scenes of a frustrated wife stepping into La-La Land, angels crashing through hospital ceilings, and the ghost of U.S. assasinated convicted spy Ethel Rosenberg walking around and offering advice, effective or merely indulgent? There's also a strange morality working here; a perceived as evil AIDS patient succumbs to the illness, while a good-hearted one survives; out and proud homosexuals are made heroic while a troubled one, guilted by his religious upbringing, is left out in the cold. An enthralling film with powerhouse characterizations, it finally doesn't all add up but it marches by proudly like lesser and greater parts of a passing parade. I couldn't help but be impressed with the overall spectacle.

Ugh! This is uninspired film making at it's most tepid. It has all the substance of a Harlequin romance novel and all the character of your worst home video. It also looks so shoddy with some of the most drab set designs I have ever seen in a film, even a ritzy country club comes off looking like the cheapest garden resteraunt. The plot? Two gay men meet, fall in love and proceed to behave like 6th Graders going steady. What trite. The only gay rights invoked here is the freedom to make a movie as bad as anyone else.

So romantically cloying, it bathes viewers in a love story that's about as subtly manipulative as tar and feathers. It starts off well enough with Eastwood arriving in a small Iowa farm town to photograph bridges for National Geographic and meeting immigrant housewife Streep with a thick Italian ( Italian? I would have guessed Czecklesovokian! ) accent. After a sexual encounter the two carry on a brief but passionate affair that's about as invigorating and sexy as Barbie kissing Ken. Through it all, Streep's husband is away at a county fair concerning something about a 'prize cow'. Talk about your Freudian nightmare! It took me several sittings to get through this tear-jerker which comes equipped with it's own box of soggy Kleenix.

Yes, Jeff Bridges is superb, but "The Door in The Floor" doesn't add up to much. Aside from the bland symbolism of the title, the film is only a romantic drama leaning heavily on the sadness of post-grieving parents adjusting to life after the death of their teenage sons. The details of that tragedy are given more importance than seem necessary and the film ultimately centers on a "Summer of '42" plotline and Jeff Bridges' breezy seasoned performance.

Grim and gripping melodrama sucks viewers in to sordid tale of three blue-collar Boston playmates brought together again as adults by a tragedy. Opening sequence is very distasteful but the story settles down as the police probe into a murder swings into high gear. Acting is uniformly great and Director Clint Eastwood has an ocean of emotion to work from. The final resolution though, seems unlikely and why did the Massachusettes FBI, and not the City Police work on this case?

After seeing this tour live in Darien Lake, New York I had to see if the DVD captured the magic of this extraordinary concert. It does. Roger Waters and his ensemble stunned witnesses to his "In The Flesh" concert tour across America and this DVD enhances that experience with revealing camera work of the performers and considerable attention to the super-wide Waters-like images that backed the stage. At the center of the stage Waters looked humble, as if unaware of the devotion and and gratitude the fans offer him, acknowledging them with a shy but commanding stage presence as if he was doing nothing more than offering them a beer. He and his ensemble became a dynamic collective force blasting out a unity heralding Water's solo career with each member becoming an integral component to the astounding musical package. Andy Fairweather Low's blazing guitar solo during "Money", Jon Carin's letter perfect vocal rendition on "Dogs", Doyle Bramhall II's constant virtuosity in interpreting Pink Floyd and David Gilmour's lead guitar work; all these performances and the rest of the musical cast brilliantly recreated Water's and Pink Floyd's music. I was reminded while watching this how much alt-music fans have to be thankful for in Roger Waters. His is a humane and intelligent delving into the psyche, questioning where we came from and fearing where we might go but always with a respect for the weakest human condition. He has remained consistent, alternative, stimulating, and challenging at a time when most contemporaries will abandon their past for the lure of a hit record. At the outdoor venue where I saw this show live, to the dismay of thousands of concert-goers, dark rain clouds threatened the sky just prior to the scheduled time, and as if on cue, to the cheers of the crowd a sudden rainbow dissipated the grey clouds like a Pink Floyd album cover just before Waters made his entrance. It was like God himself was the set designer. Yes, this DVD captures the magic of that blessed evening. Far out man.

It just barely manages to stay afloat as an action packed thriller, and you've got to ask yourself, just where did all the mega-millions poured into this film go? Besides it's promotion, that is. Like it's art history subject matter, I expected a cinematic canvas of depth and beauty, but this is more like standard action fare, as Ron Howard's generic and hurried direction rushes by like he's filming NASCAR and throwing a rude mustache on the Mona Lisa. It breathes like a lesser James Bond film, with lots of facial concentrations, typical car crash and shoot 'em up violence, and so much conversation, at times they may as well be reading aloud from the book. Unlike the book, (I suppose), it is more indebted to the action genre than it is art history, even the spliced flashback images of ancient times seems more an homage to Cecil B. DeMille, than it is true history. Tom Hanks never quite grips the role of an ancient symbols expert thrown into a diabolical plot, his security and knowledge of the subject matter is aloof and increasingly dissipates as the film progresses, like you expect him to moronically and unknowingly burst, "Hey, this is some heavy stuff!", at any moment. Audrey Tatou's role as a student of cryptic analysis, is reduced to what seems a dull investigative reporter, full of routine questions, and duly surprised reaction that only serve as springboards for the film to delve into a facts and legends expose. Picture a big budget History Channel on Halloween night. There's also a grueling sort of half-hearted glibness at mention of what seems controversial subjects; The Pope, Catholics, a blood line French family, as if the film smugly retains a secret it yet shares with its audience, and a ridiculously indulgent line uttered by Hanks at the height of action; "I've got to get to a library!", that suggests to the audience to look it up themselves if the film falls short of total explanation. I'm googling Rosalind as I speak. The Da Vinci Code is an amazingly conventional and second rate thriller. But is it art?

The shag-haired bow-tied kid at the concession stand in the theatre where I saw &quot;Bully&quot; loved this film, saying he had been to suburban Florida and kids there are capable of murder due to the extreme Summer heat and boredom. Larry Clark's disturbing true life drama of a group of middle class druggie white kids who plot murder against one of their own has that effect on viewers. Like the high school tragedy at Columbine and the similiarly paced murder by young people in the film, &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;, these things only happen in other neighborhoods. In &quot;Bully&quot;, parents muse to their drugged out doom plotting children about week-end happenings and college preparation while the kids stash their pockets with knives and family handguns and announce they are going to a movie. Sounds ironic and amusing like an Oliver Stone &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; psychedelia but it's played with a deft realism that exposes these killer's intent as a very ordinary response to a frenzied teenage angst as hot as the Florida Sun. This film is uncompromising in it's documentary-like execution, never probing deeper into it's character's motives than the one-dimensional killers one would imagine upon hearing this real life tragedy.

A dramatic historical speculation on the identity of the subject of a famous painting? OK. It seems the story of &quot;The Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; could have come up with a more intriguing idea than said subject being a house servant having an affair with the artist in his home. The real story of the lowly-classed dressed pretty woman wearing a jewel of an earring is probably much more interesting than this. The painting itself is much more interesting than this. Film starts out with an artist's eye revealing every framed image but seems to lose this technique as it moves along. The images gets shallower, as does the story. But as a romantic historical piece, it's very nice especially if you like your romantic history draped in pretension.

Aretha Franklin is one of those rare singers whose voice is as fine, if not better as decades roll by. This CD single teaser for the album of the same name boasts an artist in total control of her chords, with lush subdued production values in the title track, a poignant up-tempo self examination of advancing and fading beauty with age. Also includes snippets of four songs from the album, making this quickie more a promotion for the album than a thing in itself.

Cheap DVD collection has surprisingly fine video transfers of three very bad horror films, one trash classic and four episodes of the very early TV show (1949), "Starring Boris Karloff", retitled here as "The Veil", and incorrectly titled on the DVD cover as a Vincent Price vehicle. Horror diva Barbara Steele is "She Beast", a violent and ugly flick about a witch stepping out of her tomb in modern day Transylvania, "Bloody Pit of Horror" is a crude and bloody (maimings galore!) cheap Euro flick about a fashion shoot in a haunted castle, B movie classic "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" finds a surgeon keeping the head of his fiance alive while he searches for new body parts, and "King of The Zombies" is a laughable South Sea island zombie fest about a mad doctor training zombies to fight the allies in WWII. The episodes of the early television series, "Starring Boris Karloff" is the most interesting thing here, an anthological forerunner to "The Twilight Zone", hosted by Karloff who takes a role in each episode, the prints look well preserved, there is a fantastic roaring fire in a fireplace at the start of each episode and the program boasts a sincere interest in the supernatural, as all the episodes are allegedly based on real events. All in all, this DVD is well worth it's cheap price, the movies are adoringly bad, and the TV show proves that early programs were not entirely without sophistication.

I never read the Victor Hugo classic book. I never saw the show, never even heard the cast recording. So maybe this 'concert' recording of Broadway's "Les Miserables", is a bit too much overload for a novice. While I understand this musical is dear to Broadway lover's hearts, it's greatness, as presented here in a taped costumed performance at The Royal Albert Hall in London, eludes me almost entirely. The music is dreary variations on a military march, the vocals too long in the same key and dull, and the cutaways to filmed scenes of the actual stage production, full of technological wizardry and lavish production, looked overwrought with pageantry and theatrics. My experience wasn't helped by the balloon dropping, self-congratulating finale, that offers a roll call of 17 actors who have played the lead in "Les Mis" around the globe, parading in front of an exhausted, partyed-out audience. The thick decidedly British cockney accents, used by some of the French characters, were mind boggling. The white generic, 'Les Miserables' T-shirts worn by the entire chorus kept me in check, as if saying, "it's just a concert, it's just a concert."

If "Out Cry" was a play by a new playwright, it would be an exciting debut showing great promise. That the playwright is Tennessee Williams, ( A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof ), one could second guess the worth of this psychologically strange play-within-a-play-within-a-play concerning thespian siblings acting out a play from the confines of their self-imprisoned home to an audience of no one. It's as if the character driven pathos of Williams' earlier work have gone full blown psychotic with no chance of returning to normalcy. Certainly a cross between "Waiting For Godot" and Shirley Jackson's novel. "We Have Always Lived In The Castle". "Out Cry" is frustranting, challenging, stimulating, and manipulative. Possibly all the characteristics of a great play. It is a reworking of an earlier play from 1967 by Williams called "Two-Character Play".

Crude and cheap disc with bad piano accompaniment audio reveals Charlie Chaplin to be, surprisingly, not the physical comic genius I expected to see, but a hammy 'look-at-me!" comediene whose subtle facial expressions seems to set him apart from the wide, bold gestures of the other players. Aside from falling down, which happens a lot, there isn't really a single stunt in the eight one-reelers from 1914 shown here, and a whole lot of time where no action occurs at all. Fatty Arbuckle, whose career was ruined by a notorious sex scandal, is showcased in "The Knockout" and fares much better as a graceful. physical comediene with an inviting, commanding presense. This collection is shoddy as a product, at least one film's subtitles are in French, the piano accompaniment seems not in accordance with the film's pace, and the screen's borders omit characters that are obviously supposed to be seen.

Signature Airplane from 1971 finds the departure of singer and founder, Marty Balin, and the addition of fiddler Papa John Creach, in a San Fransisco street-wise, cosmic minded collection of songs propelled to depart this wretched earth via hallucinegenic drugs, or home built starship. "When The Earth Moves Again", is the familiar hippie battle cry of intolerance and druggie wishful thinking with the group's meandering, 'all-together-now' harmony, "If you've lived on earth you've never seen the sun, or the promise of a thousand other suns, that glow beyond here". "Pretty As You Feel", offers guitarist Jorma Kaukonen's bluesy and soulful riffs supporting a laid back, (stoned), testament of eye mascara and facial make-up for the soul addressed to a woman who is told to "go out there and knock them silly". Grace Slick's experimental, or simply downright strange, "Never Argue With A German If You're Tired or European Song", sung in German, finds Slick sounding unlike her throaty self, and more like a purely voiced, and a little tipsy, German barmaid, in a vocal manipulated, quirky sound effects laden, piano driven European philosophical binge. Closing track, "War Movie", sounds pretty much the same as opener, "When The Earth Moves Again", as Paul Katner's sci-fi imagery paints a mind altering, 'peace through science' scenario, "thirteen battalion of mind raiders, three hundred master computer killers, from great platforms in the mountains", surrounded on both sides, at the opening and closing of the song, by what sounds like a stalled barge of failed industrial revolution. I'm not sure if The Airplane/Starship ever realized their cosmic dream of "riding a bubble into the sun", their last albums, produced well into the '80's, seemed tepid Top 40 lounge for impressionable teens in love. But with "Bark", and several other titles from the late '60's and early '70's, the hope of a peaceful and promising ecological future is youthfully naive and alive, if a bit cloudy from all the drugs.

Under the clumsy title, "Take Them On, On Your Own" BRMC embraces the distance between fan base and their respective cool, celebrating and revelling in the adoration of pop stardom. These guys are more lovers than they are rebels as each melodic, harmonic song longs for the comfort of companionship yet remains fired up by it's absence. Call it hard-soft rock with an indie groove, a daisy in it's lapel, and an arm length away from vintage Badfinger and the inevitable Velvet Underground comparison for music that can well be called 'groovy'. I like it but it may be a tad too light for my total satisfaction. It might be time to crack up the bike around the next curve for the third album and try to be a bit more viscious.

A bonding of the cosmic and the mundane in a musical fantasy soundscape where your common splattered bug on the windshield flies in direct from Fairyland, Superman is nearly defeated, scientists compete to find a cure to save mankind from itself, and there is laundry to be done. All to the tune of some catchy quirky melodies. The very pretty orchestration with quivering falsetto vocal is offset by a hippie, druggie whimsey, ferocious drumming and splashes of rock guitar to keep this sensual passion play from becoming just too precious. The song, "Waiting For A Superman" is more psychologically earthward, mooning quite effectively strength gained in the loss of childhood beliefs. Certainly an odd and beautiful album.

The true story of German immigrant turned American pilot Deiter Dengler, (Christian Bale), and his subsequent capture, confinement and escape from a POW camp during The Vietnam War, echoes elements of The Great Escape, and several other escape films, while delivering its own distinct 'war is hell' eulogy in its shadowy, claustrophobic and artful camera eye which defines the hero and his fellow prisoners as a Christ figure surrounded by grungy devotees. Scenes within the confines of their jungle clearing bamboo prison cell, as the prisoners huddle together and whisper secret plans for escape, are indebted to images of famous classical Christian paintings, like an up-close and personal Da Vinci's Last Supper. With Deiter's return to freedom, in the sanitary and joyous sanctity of his home base, he is lifted horizontally above the heads of his cheering fellow soldiers while draped in white hospital convalescent clothing, looking like Jesus rising from the dead. In one scene he wrestles with a large serpant in an attempt to eat it. Director Werner Herzog's religious interpretations are like chapters that lead to a harrowing and godless scene, where an enemy in enemy land, (Deiter), screams in horror to a sky litttered with unwitting rescue helicopters. It is at once, a hope filled and hopeless scene, a picture of war itself.While following the conventions of escape films; The Deer Hunter, Midnight Express; the list goes on, Rescue Dawn is grittier and less majestic in its adventurous tone, keeping it's cinematic drive not in the panorama of heroic nature, but in the vistas of exotic beauty in the Thailand jungles where the movie was filmed, which reveal a hostile environment of flood swollen rivers, determined blood sucking slugs, and impassable jungle terrain, and the starkness of the mundane and military place of freedom where the adventure began. The movie follows the book on escape films with POW's on the verge of mental breakdown, a bowl of live worms for breakfast, discourse among escapees, emotional freedom ringing conclusion, but it does it all so artfully, you are never reminded of the other great escapes. In Deiter, played by Christian Bale, we have not a disillusioned Vietnam soldier on the verge of living a lifelong nightmare, but of the quality John Wayne boasted, but without the bravura and impossible manhood. You can picture him barbequing in his backyard with the wife and neighbors, leading a carefree life when the war is over.The film ends without revealing the fate of Deiter's fellow prisoners which is upsetting. It also offers a lingering question which may suggest topical references to our current state of military affairs. There is a psyche-bizarre scene after a torture session where Deiter seems in compliance with his recent captors as they stand near a body of water filled with, what looked like minnow sized sharks. It is suggestive of the prisoners signing papers declaring America an evil imperialistic nation after an intense psychological torment, hence their confinement, as opposed to their demise. Guantanamo Bay comes to mind.

Everything you could possibly ever want to know about American copyright law is included in this large 4th edition volume detailing the ever evolving world of copyright, including it's protection, public domain property, and determining whether a work is in the public domain. Mammoth book is a breeze to read, if you care to know it all, with informative and entertaining court rulings, (the classic film, "It's A Wonderful Life", for instance has an interesting and unsettled copyright history), but as a read-through, can become tedious, as it details everything copyright-able under the sun, (jewelry; a Coca-Cola bottle; the humongous world of the internet). Best used as a source book for determining how to find copyright history on a particular work.

Novelist with one major book under his belt has trouble selling his next. The plot then gets bizarre in a minimal high drama sort of way as he embarks on a hunt to find any means of income to support his family. Upon hearing a job prospect is a male escort the naive and gullible writer played by Andy Garcia says something to the effect of, "You mean like standing on a street corner in a big white cowboy hat?" If only. No, he is to embark on a literary metaphysical journey caused by the frustration and insecurity of writing amd make love to a beautiful woman under the watchful eye of the image of Ernest Hemingway whose writing credits he will share. In the shadows wait a sleazy barfly man from Elysian Fields looking like a scrawny weathered Hugh Hefner after sand is kicked in his face. Somebody somewhere ought to get back on their anti-psychotics.

Maybe one has to indulge in lead character Jane's party favors to enjoy "Laurel Canyon", a domestic comedy about a newly graduated physician intern who temporarily moves into his rock and roll mother's home with his girlfriend. As it is, the lusts and loves of the characters inside this Canyon mini-mansion mostly reminded me of a Frankie and Annette beach party movie complete with the foreign exotic beauty who shows up on the beach to steal Frankie's heart. Successful rock and roll producer Jane is all attitude, no characterization, strutting around her recording studio in a muscle T-shirt, smoking joints, and behaving like a poster child for a renewed subscription to 'Rolling Stone' magazine. The rest of the characters buzz around her like equally bland insects to a glaring light. This movie concerns corporate rock and roll and that just isn't cool enough. It also suffers from a sad desire to be "Absolutely Fabulous".

What can you say about "Alexander" that hasn't been said about the Encyclopedia Britanica? It's long and interesting and has great pictures of far away exotic places, and although I wouldn't want to read the Britanica cover to cover, I'd advise anyone to subject themselves to Oliver Stone's historical biography. This is a play-by-play review of the DVD. Preliminary thoughts include feeling as though I am boarding the Titanic as I sit down to watch this notoriously criticized film, and there is a nagging doubt that it is somewhat shameful for a director to approve a modified version of his product with "Faster-paced Action", like it was a new improved laundry detergent. ... Already I don't know what I hate more; the stuffy history lesson narrative, or the shiny, young Greek protege child actors with British accents, ...Much time has passed, (or so it seems, I'm not yet through the first hour), I don't think I can make it to the end. Colin Farrell (Alexander), looks like a bunny rabbit in shock, like that last living look of a soon to be road kill on a country highway. Alexander has conquered half of Asia and I keep thinking of other things I might be doing with my time, like cleaning my apartment or starting a stamp collection. As I write, Alexander and his buddies are discussing the dangers of homosexuality. Mind you, they're all in skirts. The battle marching scenes are stunning, the actual battles; so-so, with sweeping aerial scenes of thousands warring, intercut with ridiculous close-ups of swords piercing a foot, and facial reactions to injuries like being bopped on the head by The Three Stooges. The subtitles are absurd. "MACEDONIAN LEFT", means nothing to me. It's hard to tell who's winning the battle but the charging camels win best float in the parade, (I've yet to see the earth-shaking stampeding Indian elephants), ...Hell, Bush would have conquered Asia in half this time, ...There's a "Gone With The Wind" dead battlefield nod. Nice. ...I'm in Persia now. Alexander is falling in love ... with everybody. Nothing like a little Greek debauchery. Better lock up the camels and snakes. ... Damn, I hit the wrong button on the remote and I'm back to the beginning. Babylonian Twilight Zone. Was I in Persia or India?, it all looks like an ancient Asian opium room, ... I'm through the first hour. Not bad. Not bad at all. It has a youthful and adventurous "Jason and The Argonauts" appeal, and a philosophical world domination theme, and epic cinematic proportions of ancient global vistas and artistic design. What the producer's of this DVD need to do now is offer a secret Alexander decoder ring in every package. ... After nearly three hours, it's over, and the verdict is, it's long and complicated, and the ill-chronological order doesn't help matters, but it's a great film.

Just when you think there's little reason to continue watching this pathetic true life loser descending further into delusion, "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" starts running madly and doesn't stop until it's shattering conclusion, sure to mobilize your mind to a more heightened sense of awareness. Before the final twenty minutes or so, it's discomforting to share time with Sam Bicke (Sean Penn), an office furniture salesman who longs for success but seems to be sold up the river by the world at large. His wife (Naomi Watts) is divorcing him, his boss is threatening his job, his successful businessman brother is 'washing his hands' of him, and the bank has denied his loan application, in which all his future hopes and plans lie. Watching him is like running over a wild animal with your car, a feeling of disgust and helplessness, and a reassurance that you didn't swerve and hit a tree, or that your life isn't nearly as awful as his. In his warped perspective, there's nothing else to do but hijack a jet and hopefully slam it into The White House with the intention of killing the President. "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" is based on a true event that occurred in 1974 and is a chilling reminder of what we always understood to be a magnificant vulnerability in our national defense. Like the indifference we harbored in the knowledge of known terrorist ties taking American flight school lessons, we watch hopelessly and helplessly until the traumatic conclusion, with nothing left to do but learn from our mistakes.

Such a very thin story line in a colorful and colossal documentary-like depiction of mid 19th Century New York City. The camera's sweeping view of the city is an astounding sensual experience, but the final hour of the film drags terribly as the plot is chiseled down to a very weak romance and a Popeye and Bluto-like duel to the finish. The historical accuracy is alarmingly dead-on target, if my American History college course is any indication.

Post Clash project featuring bassist Paul Simonon is a flurry of Latin inspired alt-rock with regards to fast cars, motorcycles, socialist agenda, Ernest Hemingway (Death in the Afternoon), and American rockabilly, (Blue Gene Vincent). Given the relative success of this project, I always expected a follow-up album, (apparently, according to one Amazon reviewer, there is one other obscure album.). The music is exciting, with marimba slamming percussion, traditional and exotic rock guitar riffs, and bullfight inspired Cuban radio sound bites that take you away to a Spanish bullfight on a lazy afternoon. The songs have a tendacy to blend into one another in an album sameness, but the sharp and clear production always remains riveting and unexpected, wailing away in a crescendo of political angst and poetic desire.

Maybe what Truman Capote meant by the term, 'In Cold Blood', was in regard to his own perception and investigation of the murder of the Kansas farm family, The Clutters, in 1959. His assuredly manipulative means of extracting the story from convicted murderer, Perry Smith, doesn't so much question the ethics of a reporter butter stroking his subject in exchange for information, as I have heard of this film, but instead justifies a very excellent investigative reporter feeding the public's insatiable desire to know what happened that night in November, 1959. A grim and profound task for any writer, and one that will surely have a life long effect, but one could argue that Capote was long on his way to becoming a drunk before "In Cold Blood". This acclaimed drama, with a lurid and fascinating subject matter, is really just a paler version of Richard Brooks' 1967 filming of Capote's book, that featured, of all people, Robert Blake as the convicted murderer. While Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Capote is masterful in mannerisms, it is still just a superficial, albeit superb, characterization of a quirky, sensitive writer displayed through outlandish vocal and physical gestures. A writer 'writes', and watching one work does not make great cinema. It is the murders, not so much Capote, that fascinates us, and the film offers the story of "In Cold Blood" in much the same way as the original film except with it's writer directing traffic at the center. Yet, it's just about worth it to hear Hoffman, portraying Capote, sipping a drink, while muttering a put-down of his friend, Harper Lee's "To Kill A Mockingbird". Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.

The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack, a grey-necked Pennsylvainia steel town's hopes and fears are a musical noir that only wants to see the town's high school trophy football go through the field goal. Nice cinema during the football scenes. A bit dull though. If only Tom hadn't spent so much time thinking about football, he might have gotten into a better college. Life is like that.

Maybe it's the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; overtones that make this sequel leagues better than the original &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot;, which when I saw it in a theatre, came across as a bloated, mundane overdose of fantasy. Here in the domestic comfort of my living room, the DVD of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; offers an easy-going storyline that this adult always remained interested in, action that doesn't rival the tackiness of World Wrestling, and a dark visual atmosphere with less sun-god like glaring computer generated graphics than the blinding original. Speaking of computers, the little mostly naked guy with the nervous tick who guides the hobbits on their adventure had an achingly real oppressive acting style. The real actors here can at least be assured there is no threat to their profession. The hobbits themselves seemed much less like &quot;Snow White&quot; rejects and more genuine was the bond between them. The main swashbuckler dude seemed cautious of the camera while the long haired blonde Scandanavian guy was much more assured and seemed to be a real hero from Middle Earth. Loved the basic electricity look of the 'two towers', and one wonders how our own real satelite atmosphere compares. I couldn't help but wonder if this film preceded 9/11 and how much attention was given to the irony. Oh, and those tree people were much less animated than the trees in my own yard.

Christopher Guest lampoons community theatre in a hit and miss comedy that is strangely loyal to the theatrics and commitment of the community theatre. One would expect a comedy of errors climaxing to a calamitous opening night but the problems here are mundane, like an actor copping out at the last minute, and the final show itself, is rather flawless and entertaining. So, all in all, it seems a bit pointless (like community theatre?). The "Waiting for Godot" reference, is never really explored, and the whole film seems bent on either being sarcastic or serene, wavering between the two with no real destination in mind. The jokes often fall very flat (drum roll, please), but it can also be brilliantly funny, like the Director's plea to a town board meeting for more funds for the theatre (he seriously asks for $500,000!).I haven't seen other Guest vehicles like, "Best In Show", and "A Mighty Wind", but I suspect they, like this, non-chalantly poke fun at the given fields of dog shows and folk music with wry humor and sly observations that finally come across to me as haughty and aloof. A friend in community theatre recommended this film to me and I can attest, we are much more funny and much more pathetic, than what is depicted here.

A flock of escaped and born parrots are cared for and studied by a San Fransisco resident in this gentle and amiable documentary. Opening sequences of parrot caretaker, Mark Bittern, answering tourist's questions as they stroll through Telegraph Hill in San Fransisco, as if it was a zoo, and as if he was an employee of the city, are friendly and amusing introductiions to both the birds and Bittern, who becomes as much a documented study; an unemployed and somewhat aimless man who seems to have found his life's calling in caring for the birds. When the camera goes inside his apartment, which serves as a parrot hospital, the parrots take on a clown-like personae, with one appearing to really rock-out with the beat of a song Bittern plays on his guitar. Bittern, who at one time struggled to be a musician, plays a nice guitar and has a good singing voice, and the folk guitar heard throughout the film is an accomplished pleasurable score. Through the course of the filming we see a change in Bittern, he seems to have aged slightly, his frisky nature seems to be winding down to an exhaustion, as late in the film, he is passively evicted from his rent-free home, which is conveniently close to the parrot population.One feels he has run himself ragged caring for the birds and accomodating the filmmakers. This makes the undeniably happy ending all the more agreeable. There are few, if any, detailed studies of the behavior of surviving non-native escaped birds, and Bittern's notes become a definitive scientific study, even though his objectivity may be in question, with an absolute passion for the birds.The film morphs between the studies of the man and the parrots, and the incidental conclusion, left me a bit undone, with questions lingering regarding the bird's history and future, like how long has the population been existant, and what threat, if any, do they pose to native species? It's a sweet little documentay shuffling science and emotion with some very colorful characters, not all of which are feathered.

Stanley Kubricks's long picturesque saga of an Irish rogue in 18th Century Europe is certainly the most entertaining costume drama ever made. Each frame of the film is filled with visual splendor as meticulous as a classic painting. Panoramic battle scenes and richly detailed costume and set designs come alive as from an artist's palette. Ryan O'Neal's bogus Irish accent is easily forgiven as he seems merely a prop in the center of Kubrick's vision of European aristocracy in conflict with an Irishman's independence. The pistol dueling scenes are outstanding.

Like the gentle familiar sound of a creaky wooden rocking chair, Robert Frost's aged voice recites some of his most beloved poems in this cassette companioned book recorded at his home in Cambridge, Massachusettes in 1956. In Frost's conservative tone, he still achieves a degree of radicalism, as the road not taken on a frosty winter morning, while being Thoreau-ish, and as warm and philosophical as a bowl of Campbell's soup, is also often filled with striking psychological ghosts and tragic human consequences, both the good and the evil of the human heart. "The Witch of Coos", stands out as a poem extravaganza, offering unsettling spookery, profound humanism and amusing folk story.

America had it's Woodstock and Canada had it's, well ... train. A train carrying the likes of Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, The Band, and many other significant 60s rock and roll icons, on a cross-country three concert stop through Canada. It is amazing that this film was ever dormant or lost, as it is a historic and artistic documentation of powerhouse musical forces performing together on stage and partying and jamming in a coach car on a train for the sheer joy ot it. To see Janis Joplin plopped among these festive partyers, singing like she was just another hippie roadie or to watch mild mannered, reserved Jerry Garcia, like he was just another guy on a train with an incredible talent on guitar, is a reward no true rock and roll fan can be without. The concerts, made all the more dramatic by the social politics of the day, are moving testements to the magnificance of these performers, and the DVD extra performances are just as wonderful. Woe to those who apparently were on the train and refused to give permission ( New Riders of The Purple Sage ) to participate in this fantastic journey. It's the spirit of rock and roll, brother!

Moody and slow dramatic think-piece concerning the state of marriage looks and sounds very much like an afternoon soap opera. A couple, (Richard Crenna and Susan Clark), realize the futility of their marriage when asked by his parents to renew their vows during the elder couple's anniversary. Maybe not the most encouraging words to say about the institution of marriage, but most viewers will recognize the serious nature of commitment to love. Crenna and Clark are fascinating as a couple who see each other almost as strangers after years of marriage. A Broadway Theatre Archive DVD.

Maybe Brad Pitt can't help but look so gosh darn cute. And maybe Anthony Hopkins can't help but pull off a rather excellent portrayal of the 'Bonanza - Ben Cartright' pioneer dad. Maybe beautiful Julia Ormond has talent, but as the old joke goes, it certainly isn't acting in front of a camera. Maybe the book this sprawling western is based on is better than the movie. Maybe it skipped over plot transformations like a stone skipping across a pond. Maybe if I had never seen Elvis Presly in "Love Me Tender", this would seem original. Maybe a shoot-out over a small time bootleg whiskey industry is not the climax I had in mind. Maybe this should have been a CBS Sunday Night Movie, and I would have known to avoid it. Maybe there is no explanation as to why it's called "Legends of The Fall". Maybe I was expecting the OK Coral. Maybe if it had continued much longer Brad Pitt's character would have travelled to the moon ( he had already covered the globe.). Maybe if I had known there was a killer grizzly bear segment coming, I wouldn't have watched at all.

It was always perfectly obvious to me what Billie Jo McAllister and the narrator of Bobbie Gentry's classic country story-song, "Ode To Billie Jo" threw off the Tallahassee Bridge. It was an aborted fetus, and later, Billie Jo doesn't jump, but is pushed off the Tallahassee Bridge. There is a haunting sense of guilt in Gentry's slow southern drawl as she sings of a lazy summer when dread hung over the dusty delta like a merciless sun. What a great song. It still sounds as inviting and mysterious, alt-country really, as it did when it ruled the AM radio airwaves in 1967. Only one other song on this greatest hits package measures up to the class act of 'Billie Jo', and that is "Fancy", an upcharged, very cool hit record telling the story of a prostitute's rise to fortune, with great Americana folk - just this side of tragi-corny lines like, "Your Pa's run off and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death." It was a colorless mid-nineties remake hit by Reba McIntyre, but this original is a slick pop masterpiece with a chugga-chugga tamborine and percussion musical break, and some hip street talk as the singer hooks up with 'Sean', who becomes "a congressman and an occasional aristocrat" and buys her a Georgia mansion. "Oklahoma River Bottom Band", a failed 45rpm single, is a delta-bluesy, sluggish Mississippi River ballad with a southern jug band equivalent of Beatles' White Album mystique; Gentry sings in seeming reference to the phenomenal success of 'Billie Jo' - "I told you society, green apple piety, death of variety, Oklahoma river bottom band." Most the other songs on this Collectables CD (18 in all), although strong delta-blues inspired compositions, are buried in an over production of incidental orchestration, and the duets with Glen Campbell, from Capital Records', "Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell", are atrocious, with Gentry unsuccessfully trying to tind a comfortable octave among Campbell's perfect tenor. The CD has a brief bio of Bobbie Gentry, but fails to mention she quit the 'business' in the '70s, and never returned, and remains today a missing oddity, like a sane Syd Barrett of country music.

Four plays by William Inge all published and produced on Broadway in the 1950s. The plays are underbellies of the American dream concerning modestly incomed average Americans facing conflict in a changing social environment, each with a deep dramatic sense of the human spirit riddled softly with a genuinely comedic edge. &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; is a low-key story of a recovering alcoholic which rises to thunderous and violent drama. &quot;Picnic&quot; follows two Kansas households whose lives are disrupted when a stranger comes to town during a Labor Day weekend. &quot;Bus Stop&quot; concerns an unlikely wedding engagement among a group of stranded passengers in a coffee shop bus stop. Only &quot;Dark At The Top of The Stairs&quot; is a little less focused in it's story of a 1920s family threatened by marital discord, the play is unfortunately reliant on a shock-value incident which seems to only serve as a melodramatic device. The book includes an essay by William Inges on being a successful playwright.

Killing Joke's mix of heavy metal and melodic pop hooks fuel &quot;Democracy&quot; into a confused, rather bland set of songs that seem a mix of '70s 'Boston', 80's 'The Cult', and 90's grunge, never identifying itself as the dark post punk distinctive Brit sound Killing Joke is alleged to be, but instead revealing a swirl of many hard rock ideas unfortunately anchored in an '80s time capsule where the beat goes on and on but never seems to get anywhere. The songs too often use the same formula of a grunting hard-edged vocal transforming into a lighter melodic sing-song soft core voice with vibrating 'Cult' guitars and repetitious, thump, thump, bang, bang, drums that clumsily combine punk with melody. They seem capable of more and a good Producer could have trimmed the clutter and the repetition in a more pronounced vision of social politics, which seems to be the aim here.

Japaneese punk recorded live in the studio onto 4-track is as crude as an A.M. transistor radio blasting out Ramones singles at fast speed. Now slam that transistor on the sidewalk, open the back and find a pulsating thingamijing vibrating a strangely foreign tongue like other wordly messages, and you have Teengenerate. Vocalist Fink does a dead-on early Joe Strummer and the rest of them do a mean Alvin and The Chipmunks.

As difficult to digest as The Clash's original, SANDANISTA!, this tribute album, which covers all 36 songs from the 1980 three album set by The Clash, comes with all the warts and band-aids, ups and downs, of the original work. By far, the best track here, (and one of my favorites from the original album), is Wreckless Eric's, take on The Clash's stoned-out, ska-hazy, "The Crooked Beat", which takes an already bizarre but strangely calming song and turns it into ska from Mars, with obstructing clash-like sound effects cutting into it, like a fleet of flying saucers interfering with your car radio. Also completely satisfying is Willie Nile's point blank interpretation of The Clash's cover of The Equals' "Police On My Back". It's a fiery charged-up cover which knows enough not to twist that which is already perfect. Lou Carlozo's "Living In Fame" sounds like any '60's pop band forced to crash into the far future, with claustrophobic remnants of song that were once a simple melody, and Tim Krekel's "Version City", allows that song to come full circle with what it always wanted to be; an Americana folk junkie praise of railroads.But too often, many of the songs are tiring novelty numbers that are more cutesy than interperative, and some of the lazy covers are simply bland. It's fun to hear the disco meets cold war, "When Ivan Meets G.I. Joe", as a corny country and western duet, but fun only once. And certainly something more novel could have been applied to "Mensforth Hill", which originally was a song from side one played backwords on side 5. If you're a Clash fanatic, hollowed ground is trampled upon when the climactic, war and peace mongering, "Corner Soul", is interpreted as if it were an Elton John number.If you're that Clash fan (had all the albums, all the imports, shed a tear when Joe Strummer died), you'll stand behind SANDANISTA!, regardless how you feel about it, as you would behind an impossible, problematic brother. You'll defend it, hate it, love it, and stop just short of throwing the whole damn thing atop a book burning pile. So while this is a worthy project, (aren't all tribute albums?), it is, for me, unfriendly packaging. Designed like the original album, with a faux newspaper, (The Armagideon Times), I take exception to the smug light Seinfeld-like humor of the accompanying comic strip with representatives of two generations, (now and then), discussing SANDANISTA! in a Starbucks. And if you read the 2007 Armagideon Times Update, you may cock a pierced eyebrow and spit everytime the writer attests to generally hating tribute albums, (this is SO tribute album), and labelling side 6 from the original album as "evil", and unlistenable. It's always been my favorite side, and much more contemplative and listenable than the other 5 sides of the original vinyl.But I digress, as SANDANISTA! is prone to make me do. This tribute album is certainly as worthwhile a listen as the original work which I once called, "London Calling's ugly sister". It opens the door again to the conflicted, chaotic follow-up to the brilliant "London Calling". It causes one to consider Joe Strummer's historic legacy, and his strange creative left turn mess of an album that is SANDANISTA! He's probably out there somewhere, still rebelling against heaven.POSTSCRIPT, 11/2/09 - I said, "Corner Soul" is trampled upon and is interpreted as if it was an Elton John number. Funny what time does to music. It is now my favorite track on the disc. I don't know how I missed it's exceptional and haunting quality. Some amateur reviewer I turn out to be.

Small documentary of rock outfit, Wilco, creating and producing their album, "Yankee Foxtrot Hotel", is given added drama when their record company, Reprise, drops the band upon completetion of the album. Wilco ensemble pieces, in the studio, and on stage, are flawless rock and roll songs delivered with a raw energy of unified musicianship, certainly the music is the best thing about "Break Your Heart". The discretionary camera has no qualms filming Wilco lead Jeff Tweedy vomitting in the bathroom as the pressure of the album becomes strained, but we only hear of guitarist Jeff Bennett's dismissal from the band in it's aftermath, the undocumented heave-ho is looked back upon like the passing of a friend. Although there is cause to celebrate when the album is finally released to glowing reviews, the justification of it's success is tarnished when "Foxtrot" is finally released by the same corporation who owns Reprise. There's no great evil-doer here, except maybe Tweedy himself, who justifiably retains artistic control over his band, and seems delighted when Bennett is no longer a member of Wilco. The money from the album still goes into another pocket of giant Warner Brothers music. What is interesting is that Warner Brothers Records even temporarily chooses not to release what will become a worthwile longstanding profit, while probably at the same time, released scores of less profiteering material from flash-in-the-pan artists. This DVD is an outstanding music package, the documetary is certainly interesting, but there seems little reason for filming in black and white.

In &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;, Woody Allen was fearful of the belief that all things we do in life we are destined to do for eternity and that meant he would have to sit through &quot;The Ice Capades&quot; again. I feel much the same way about this film. Slack jawed Gena Rowlands has a powerful deadpan delivery that can turn the worst sentences into words of delight, but her Philosophy Professor character here is a dud, never revealing any concern for her subject and writing a book, a significant part of the film, that we are told nothing about. Instead of delving into her potentially interesting psyche, the film instead finds her renting a New York apartment to write her book and overhearing a remarkably unexciting session from a psychiatrist's office through the, ahem, heating duct which causes her to evaluate her life. It's a swarmy cast of characters methodically groping for life's meaning in a pointless surreal search. Woody should have included himself opposite Rowlands to give the film a comedic edge and erase that Bergman nonsense because what we have here is truly a 'Stars on Ice Extravaganza'.

Zany, delightful, and strangely compelling comedy purporting the host of TV's "The Gong Show" was a hit man for the CIA. Director George Clooney has a deep apprecitation for TV's pop culture and a wide span grip on this unyielding but doubtful true story, from the autobiography of Chuck Barris who had the audacity to confess to the world that while host of "The Gong Show", he was a CIA assassin. Vintage takes on "The Newlywed Game" and "The Dating Game" sharply define muted sexual psychedlia that was '60s network television. Yet the question remains - was he or wasn't he a hit man for the CIA? Come on, Chuck! Must we say so? We've always loved you! Go ahead and have your little delusion. It's just a little guilt you're dealing with. We forgive you for "The Gong Show Movie"!

It sounds like a psychotic reaction to a Catholic mass. Something horrified goes running from the church. Bells, chants, booming crescendos, and a glockenspiel tied to a lead weight, go hand in hand with swirling and standard back vocals, (oooh, aaah, oooh), which are about as progressive as The Partridge Family, complimented and compensated by a weird, whimpering lead vocal that sounds like an alien-being with lockjaw attempting to mimic the human voice. Washed over by a wave of alarming, climactic vocal structure, and tinkered by a constant, brainwashing keyboard that sounds like a passive-aggresive hearing test from a very bad nightmare. Accesible? Not if your of this world. I know one thing. I drove down a lonely highway from central New York State to Pennsylvania on a cold stormy winter night, and popped this new CD in the player, and I swear, SOMETHING was trying to take control of the steering wheel.

I am bewildered by the unanimous positive critical response to this movie. It's "The Godfather" meets "Father Knows Best" with a virtual bloodbath of gangster executions warmed over by a "Dad, can we have a man to man talk" mentality. The director screams "PERIOD PIECE!" with exquisitely manicured 1930s set designs that upstage the crummy little story of a boy being taken under the wing of his viscious but kindly gangster father. Jude Law playing a profiteering hitman/photographer is the only redemption here, his deranged characterization is the true spirit of this movie. I would have much preferred watching his life story for over two hours.

Collection of Sonic Youth singles between 1983 and 1988 sounds great but the songs don't stand as well alone as they do in the midst of their original albums. In fact, they leave one hungry for the wholeness of a Sonic Youth album and that seems to be the marketing strategy for &quot;Screaming Fields of Sonic Love&quot;. 8 page CD booklet offers nostalgic pictures of vintage advertising posters for early &quot;Sonic Youth&quot; shows.

Moody, slow-going and atmospheric Russian film about a man returning to his wife and two sons after a long absence. He takes his sons on a long awaited fishing trip which becomes a strange odyssey of paternal bondage as his interest in the sons reaches psychological tension on the fringes of surrealism. The image of 'father' hangs over this film like a grey Russian sky, and it is only in the reuinion of the three that one understands the absence of the father in the son's lives. The two young actors playing the sons are remarkable, delivering almost uncanny acuracy as embittered and questioning children, but the rather dramatic ending seems an afterthought and besides the point.

Dreadful little bit of family dysfunction in which the awkwardness of making a good impression on your partner's family, is treated like a psychological horror fest in a series of crude and mean spirited situations. Craig T. Nelson as the Dad, violently slamming his fist on the table as a reaction to a dinner guest's ignorant and naive comments, was about as much as I could take of this on the verge of violence family. Dermmont Mulroney, as the boyfriend of the family's scorn, (Sarah Jessica Parker, - too stiff and unreal, and still the best performance here)), so cruelly allows his family to gang up on his partner, you just want to take him out in the yard and slap him around. When the family tries to make amends and goes romping around like The Brady Bunch on Christmas morning, (the Christmas pudding ends up in a lap) it is shooting from the hip, finally covering all aspects of drama and comedy, but never allowing us to give a Christmas fig about any of them, except maybe Parker whose sad plight gets emotionally reckless. The Family Stone could have served better with any degree of subtlety, and maybe a sly twist at it's inevitable tragic outcome.

Broadway musical performed before a live Los Angeles audience, based on a 19th Century British urban legend, if you will, about a barber, (George Hearn) who cuts the throats of his clients, and his lady friend co-hort, (Angela Lansbury) who bakes the victims into meat pies. But before you can say, 'Little Shop of Rocky Horrors', know that "Sweeney Todd" takes itself very seriously; Stephen Sondheim's majestic and fun score is based on traditional opera, and it is an almost overwhelming musical delight of Broadway heaven with sweeping, complex and tuneful musical arrangements.It also has a slight case of indulgence. While the melodramatic book of a barber incensed with revenge over an unjust prison sentence is certainly emotional and involving, the comedic and horrific killing rampage almost gets out of hand for it's sheer vivid and realistic cruelty, and the unlikelihood of the two killers easily slicing the throats of random barber shop patrons and turning them into meat pies, without so much as a missing person report filed, rocks the realm a bit. These scenes seem to be the equivalent of the opera lady with a ram's horns helmet on. The book succeeds in celebrating the unity of the worst and meekest of humankind, and tries, sometimes successfully, to deliver the message that we are all killers at heart, so forcefully that you may find yourself silently re-commiting to a pro or con capital punishment or abortion agenda.While the song, "A Little Priest" goes on far too long in a cutesy bad pun lyric of the various pies certain dead men would make, - "The clergy is too coarse and too mealy", and the bright zippy "By The Sea" seems from another show entirely, (although it does establish Angela Lansbury's character's own desires and hopes), the rest of the music absolutely shines in accordance with it's theme. There is a moment of near ecstacy as the company marvels over the satisfaction garnered from consumption of the pies in "God That's Good", one of many musical highlights. The company is thoroughly and equally excellent from George Hearn's Lon Chaney-like, obsessed and fiendish, yet gentlemanly Todd, down to the least chorus member.The DVD itself is not very special, with average sound quality, and there is some question as to the 'live' recording, as audience and players sometimes seem out of sync with each other, and players at times appear to be lip-singing. It doesn't diminish the general high standards of the production. It is a fine documentation of one of Broadway's most memorable and bizarre moments.Gotta run. My microwaved pot pie just dang.

I just couldn't accept two police officers from Los Angeles under investigation for suspicious activities would end up together in a small fishing village in Alaska to help solve a murder. It made no realistic or metaphoric sense. The plausibility becomes even more bizsrre when one of them breaks a firearms rule that even a 15-year old with a hunting permit couldn't possibly commit. It's part of the psychological profile drawn here of a trigger-happy, sleep deprived man with a haunted past shooting in a dark fog. I cringed at the dueling character driven acting battles between hero Al Pacino and villain Robin Williams. They seemeed like two Hollywood stars doing facial trick ponys. I couldn't help but wonder what another actress might have done with Hilary Swank's role of exactly two emotions: naive giddiness and suspicion, coming across as a more serious Barney Fife with a computer. Oh, for one of the resident's of TV's 'Northern Exposure' to stroll on to one of these scenes to put it all in perspective. At the center of this sprawling drama is a corpse of a young girl soon forgotten as Director and cast look toward sunsets of their own, none of them shared by me.

The premise of the history of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from a college frat-like tough boy club, where pig-pen mud wrestling and macho truth or dare sessions, ("Tell us something about yourself you've never told anyone"), were the order of the day, through to a troubled and scrutinized CIA in the early 1960's and the Cuban Bay of Pigs missile crisis, makes, as backdrop, a much more intriguing story than THE GOOD SHEPHERD's main focus - an upstart recruit's success and conflict, during the founding years of the organization, as he tries to live by his belief to know who you can trust. He soon finds he can trust no one but himself, but before we are accustomed to Matt Damon's bookish characterization of a serious minded government agent, (he's described as a tight-"behind" with no sense of humor), we can't help but wonder why he was so aggresively sought out by the CIA as a junior member. He's first seen, in drag, make-up, wig and falsetto voice, on a college theatrical stage singing in a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He is, (gulp) a poetry student, and his father committed suicide with the distinction of being a traitor to the U.S. government. These should not be high marks on a CIA score card. But without further explanation he's sought after as if he's the ideal candidate. The rest of the film is a series of knee-deep espionage, and double agent revelations that apparently astounded the filmmakers, (musical score soars), but which could be found as passive page-turners in a mediocre paperback spy novel, (watch out for the brunette with the 'hearing aid' and eastern European accent who asks you over for dinner; wink, wink, nudge, nudge). The film goes on for three hours and is missing a narrative drive despite some dramatic pitstops along the way; Angelina Jolie is quite effective as Damon's socialite wife, and the Bay of Pigs segment seems an accurate portrait of the blundering by the U.S. government, but THE GOOD SHEPHERD mostly shepherds along as if searching a landmark statement it never reveals.

Somewhere in this gloomy picture they're may be a decent women's prison exploitation flick. But as a horror film, the movie seems unable to settle into a niche of the gender before abandoning it and exploring another. At once, film noir, simple detective, horrific, &quot;Gothika&quot; changes hands like a deck of flip cards out of chronological order, finally settling on a bizarre plea of social conscience. Before then the movie is often just flip. When a local newspaper's banner front page headline reads, &quot;Local Girl Commits Suicide&quot;, the fine line between black and white isn't grey, but completely colorless.

This movie was rolling along with irreverent comedic grace until it threw its playing cards in the air leaving Igby, the privileged, juvenile anti-hero, left to confidently fend for himself in a world that will surely eat him alive. Going down I suppose. In an attempt to fuse some moral substance into this misguided teen, the pat climax concerning a death bed emotional outbreak seemed forced upon the script and cruel. Too bad the movie weakens because I liked the drug addicted, money-grubbing Igby but are we to undertand his freedom and redemption is won only through the circumstances of the morbid death scene and a character whimpering in a mental institution? Kieran Culkin is amazing in the title role bringing believability to a character possessing a lashing intellectual wit who apparently never read a book in his life. Unfortunately Ryan Phillippe couldn't have been any less interesting as his preppie older brother and Claire Danes as a love interest seemed bursting at the seam with something just verging on acting ability. I guess you have to be really fond of Igby, I mean really fond, to see his character emerge as anything but a future fatality.

Documentary of the life of artist Andy Warhol is a visually exciting rapid fire attack of 60s psychedelia as seen through the life and times of a group of New York City tragically hip, hapless celebrities that flocked around the elusive, indifferent Warhol like a 'Night of the Living Dead' fashion show. It's a seemingly endless parade of Warhol art, movies and photos which ultimately define the world of Andy Warhol. That his art is a pop culture commercial gimmick is a notion long been put to rest and the seriousness of his work is heralded and applauded here, an artist of the 1960s who chose not to run from rampant commercialism, but to turn and confront it. The names of celebrities captured from Warhol's home movies would read like a Who's Who of pop culture but it's Warhol himself who leaves the most lasting impression, a modest witty genius, a serious artist, and a cultural phenomena.

A paradox of good and bad cinema, like last year's &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, it is a mile-wide screen of bleak, bright images, like watching clothes drying on a clothes line in a mesmerized trance. The country of Japan has never before been seen as beautiful and revealing as this, miles of winding road hillsides and clay carved suburbia as comfortable as &quot;The Flintstones&quot; neighborhood. The black and white film (silver, really) is colorized at the Director's discretion, a subtle change from grey to color with the emotional rhythm of the movie. But &quot;Eureka&quot;, about three post-traumatic stress victims on the lam puts women and mental disorder in a samurai's spitoon. I never believed Japaneese women were as subservient as this in their households, and not only is a typhoon coming, there is a serial killer on the run. Time to hit the road. And it does for over 3 1/2 hours. I just wanted to drive these characters to a hospital quick. Still, a generous dosing of tranquil hypnosis and gorgeous scenery.

1984 Brit pop group dabbling in funk and ska yielded one great song; "Tenderness", a jingly piano-driven, bassoon enhanced, unabashedly sweet, catchy song that contains maybe the most representative line of '80s suppressed left wing agenda, - "I open my mouth and out pops something spiteful.", it rises above the hyperactive vocals and dull routine funk of the other songs, although the song, "General Public", adds Middle Eastern and progressive elements in a grandiose album closing. Band member, Ranking Roger (vocals, keyboards), has put out at least one fine Motown influenced solo album, and Clash guitarist Mick Jones, plays some rough guitar on some of the tracks. The band needs to lean more towards it's tender side than it's frantic funk.

From the same book of stories that brought "In The Bedroom" to film, this slow moving but forever involving drama of marriage infidelity probes with a secure eye the depths of the institution of marriage. Two successful college town couples fall into affairs with each other's spouses creating a tense plot that becomes increasingly knotted until it seems bound to snap, all the while digging deeper and deeper into the question of marriage as a viable way of life in the 21st Century. Director John Curran creates a subtle yet gripping picture and the four leads are excellent, notably Laura Dern as a stay-at-home Mom with a longing for securement.

The 17th in the Huh musical compilations, an unidentified music source that seems to come from nowhere. I have a handful of these CDs, all exceptional, with a harder rock and roll edge cutting into the indie landscape. I find it difficult to believe they're as scarce as their prices suggest, they once plentifully littered used CD bins, but this one has at least two songs which may be hard to find elsewhere; Gene's "Sick, Sober, & Sorry", the B-side to the "Olympian" single, is a lightweight, twangy, Morrisey devoted ode to drinking and smoking, and Hank's "Helen Says" is an indie-generic, acoustic strumming, jangle questioning the insane party in a relationship, from the album, appropriately, "Are You Insane". Some outstanding tracks rise this above the sludge of indie samplers; Spain's Untitled track, from the album, "The Blue Moods of Spain", is a very fine blue mood, walking "away from all my crimes", into a tequilla flavored sunset, and Binsey Poplars' "Spoons", sounds like spoonfuls of early Siouxsie and The Banshees in an acid-tinged, adrenaline rushed nuclear morning.

It's interlocking stories build to a warm blanket of security and good will under the ominous tone of a sky-less New York. It's funny how things turn out.

Brrr, it's chilly in here. The Dramatic's signature vocal arrangements ("What You See Is What You Get", "In The Rain"), are missing in this 1990 break-beat galore album, replaced by a generic, indifferent collection of songs that indeed are stone cold. Twenty years after their biggest hits, The Dramatics sound like only producer's property willing to agree to the typical light jazz, rhythm and blues style of the era. No outstanding tracks, no defining moments, the horns are the best thing about it, and they seem to want to wail over many songs in an attempt to hijack this misguided production into jazz.

Just when we were about to write Genesis off as a relic from the prog rock dinosaur age, came this dazzling 1983 album which secures the band's progressive rock sound, their later penchant for Top 10 hit singles, and adds a signature reminder, without bowing to the new wave and post punk of the day, that they are just a damn good rock band, capable of writing music outside the box regardless of classification. The mix of great songs, (Mama, Home By The Sea, Taking It All Too Hard, Illegal Alien), and worthwhile filler material, (Second Home By The Sea, Just A Job To Do, Silver Rainbow), defines Genesis as an odd geometric shape, like the album cover picture. You accept and love the lesser material as a testement to Genesis's time and place in 1983, it sounds today like a 'before it's time' enhanced CD with bonus tracks. What secures this album as a pop masterpiece, as good as the compositions are, is Phil Collins fiery, growling, soft and complicated vocal tracks.

Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic.

This is a superficial yet amusing comedy about an Italian man who marries despite his better judgement. Before Dustin Hoffman became a star in &quot;The Graduate&quot; he starred in this Italian subtitled film speaking his dialogue in English while dubbed by an Italian actor. Even with these cinematic barriers he displays his understated genius flair for comedy in quirky mannersims and facial misgivings as the hapless husband watching his Italian divorce-less marriage explode before his eyes. The premise here, an Italian wife too difficult to live with (think Sophia Loren throwing dinner plates) is shallow but the cast including Stefania Sanderelli as the wild bride is full of spirited conviction.

The East Side Los Angelos sound, as depicted here, may have less to do with great rock and roll roots, as it does with marketing strategy. These great crude A.M. radio wannabes were hacked out from small recording studios, indebted to the current trends of the day, to either sink or swim into the Top 100 record lists. Opener "So You Want to Rock" by Chuck Carlson and The Majestics, is virtually "Do You Wanna Dance?" (Dave Clark 5) with different words, and The Atlantic's "Sloop Dance" makes no bones about lifting "Hang On Sloopy". The early stuff has some great uncredited California sounding electric guitar ( the only credits offered here are the artists and the songwriters), and there are some bona fide classics amongst the hacks and novelty acts - (check out "Olive Oil" by The Mixtures in which the entirety of the lyrics is the cartoon heroine seductively saying, "Ohhh, Popeye!", to which a very bad impersonation answers "Olive Oil!", while a rock band from Frankie and Annette's world backs them up. One can only assume the song is entitled "Olive Oil" because they couldn't secure the rights to the name 'Popeye'.). But, is not "Hopped Up Mustang", by Arlen Sanders, the best car song ever recorded, with it's simple tale of a drag race with a Cadillac, fitted with the most perfect engine's roar zooming by? Runner-up may be The Romancer's ode to the depths some women will reach in "She Took My Oldsmobile". The Premier's "Farmer John" is a rauckus party song with an audience whooped up to near hysterics, and their later stuff, "Get On This Plane", and "Come On and Dream", have the making of classic psych-garage, and they sound like they could have been huge, in the right hands. The crown jewel here is, Cannibal and The Headhunter's "Land of 1000 Dances", a big natiional hit, it still sounds voodoo frightening and oh, so crude. There are no master tape transfers here, most (all?) are lost, and these recordings were taken from original vinyl, and you can even here some comforting scratch sounds from the old records. They are all worthy of salvaging and saving, (ok, if you were to throw some of them into the ozone, they just might get thrown back), but they are a lot of fun, indeed historic, and you may not find another chance to hear them.

Exotica lounge music by musician-composer Robert Drasnin (piccolo), who used to be Director of Music for CBS Television. This reissue of an obscure record album, created when 'bachelor pad music' was a successful musical genre, has an eerie, other-worldly quality, like a 'Night of The Iguana' tropical resort complete with voodoo glow skulls, flaming torches and forbidden love on a moonlit beach.

I don't know anything about this guy but this is pure early rockabilly with Buddy Holly, Elvis and Hank Williams influence breezing across the music like a fine tuned fiddle. A lttle more country than rock, Campi is comfortable in both genres with a natural drawl and a becoming break in his voice that sounds as pure as a first take on audio. A reissue of an earlier album one would suppose, covering the years 1951 to 1996, the transfers range from crude; the lovely old vinyl charm o &quot;Toe Tapping Rhythm&quot;, to high-gloss; the campy (Campi?) lounge lizardry of &quot;I Love You So Much It Hurts&quot;.

This comprhensive book is insistant on teaching a conservative method of craps and ignoring, indeed vehemently disdaining, the more tempting and colorful craps bets that the author proclaims to be money loser tbat glitter like tempting gold coins on the craps table. These and other tips are forcefully ingrained into the reader until they are nearly mantra-like in the mind. Still, by the time I arrived at the craps table I found myself wishing I could reach for this book to help me out with a bet or a question. I don't think the dealers and other players would have appreciated my referring to a "How To Play Craps" paperback in the middle of a roll. So later I read the book again and I'm still referring to it. Only complaint; the depiction of women as less than perfect craps players. I'm a less than perfect craps player. My first roll went flying off the table and sailing across the room like I was throwing darts. The author attributes such a wild throw to women and often refers to them as some kind of good luck charm.

Maybe this Spanish speaking film suffers from a bad translation. Still transfixed by Writer/Director Almodovar's haunting and powerful "Talk To Her", I was swept into the theatre by advanced word of mouth and glowing reviews heralding his new film, a film noir to end all film noir. Now that it's over, I'm having trouble remembering this film, and it's only a few hours old, about a movie screenplay based on two young boy's experiences in a Catholic school. That is the basis of this film within a film within a film ... ( I'm no mathematician ), that pulls the plug on the alerted mind and dilutes it with a constant barrage of actors playing multiple parts and questions too tedious for answers. For instance, what does Alfred Hitchcock, Moon River, Breakfast At Tiffany's, and transvestites all have in common? Well, ... I haven't the slightest idea. This is film noir overdose. This is like waking from a dream to feel it slowly dissipate until it is mostly forgotten. All that's left is a bizarre scramble of guys in wigs and priests in business suits. Oh yes, and the Spanish version of "Moon River", which is sung by a boy just before he is molested. Crazy stuff, man.

I've seen a lot of bird migration documentaries on PBS and Cable TV and I was concerned this film would be merely a big screen adaptation of those same films, but this is something more, much more. It's a superlative documentary about bird migration boasting the most fantastic aerial camera work of birds in flight ever seen. A minimal amount of narration allows the wonder of bird flight to be seen as if from a child's viewpoint of awe inspiring images so startling one is filled with momentary disbelief. The naked camera eye watches as a bird beats it's wings in flight with such physical endurance, one can't help but almost feel it's heart beating to the rhythm of it's effort. I believe it was a flock of colorful Rose-Breasted Geese that the camera documented flying through a bleak industrial European city like an other wordly beauty against a Fritz Lang 'Metropolis' urban landscape. I loved the soundtrack music, some of it co-written by rock icon Nick Cave. It was just weird enough to offset the intensity of the natural science of migration. Only quibble, why not humor us and save that poor broken-winged shore bird eaten alive be gigantic sand crabs? I know this isn't Disney but it's also not your run of the mill cold nature film. This is the second film I've seen this year, the other being "Standing In The Shadows of Motown", in which the audience burst into spontaneous applause as the last credit rolled.

OK, so Woody Allen doesn't own a monopoly on Manhatten comedy dramas. I liked this film very much. I was sympathetic for the characters and felt very involved in their lives. The TV documentary angle may have been unecessary but certainly didn't hamper the film's narrative. Like an Allen film with somewhat tiny-er characters, it doesn't ape or pay homage to Woody, but remains an individual and entertaining voice and a very nice stroll through Manhatten.

THE FANTASTIC FOUR would be stopped at the door of a superhero cocktail party. It would take all of Superman's effort not to glibly chuckle upon hearing one of them have the ability to elongate his arms to fit into tiny crevices. They seem to be stuck in the era of their creation, 1961, when optimum space and combustible fireballs may have been leading issues in science. It is not so fantastic, indeed a little silly, to watch Mr. Fantastic's deformed rubberized ability, a handy trick should you drop your keys down a sewer drain, but hardly the stuff of jumping tall buildings in a single bound. The comic book superhero movie genre has grown a bit tired, and THE FANTASTIC FOUR does little to elevate it's status, with a cramped visual style, a fault in many comic adaptations, using the tall building metropolis backdrop so often, it looks like it never leaves the same city street. Yet, as a kiddie toy movie, the tongue in cheek here, so firmly planted in a fun time, delivers a quick and enjoyable romp of supporting players in the comic book hall of fame. Ioan Goufudd, as Reed, or Mr. Fantastic is remarkably in tune to the bland dynamics of the leading hero, and Michael Chiklis, as The Thing, a sort of cross between The Incredible Hulk, The Michlin Man, and The Adams Family's Uncle Fester, offers a thoughtful, riotously funny interpretation of the reluctant monster.

Classy, hyper-active monster of a movie that is a constant barrage of viscious violence overruled by the enthralled viewer's and unsympathetic but wonderful lead character's adaptation to an environment that is indeed a city of God, if truly even one person escaped it's grip. Picture "West Side Story" run wild in living hell standing off and challenging a colorful Brazilian street carnival stomping across switchblade slashing and gun-popping gangland violence with more trafficking than a thousand crushed ant hills. There is so much artistry here but I was particularly delighted with the jam-packed nightclub scenes with dance-crazed patrons looking primitive and clumsy compared to the electrified ballet of life going on out in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. A superb film, beautifully conceived and executed with a dynamic enormous cast, some of whom were recruited from the very slums of Rio where the film is based and apparently shot. Magnificant.

The theatrics and birth of the first staged version of "Peter Pan", including the first female actress to play Peter, is often overshadowed by the maudlin romantic drama that is the bulk of the film, in which the heroine coughs that fateful movie-death-cough and author J.M. Barrie goes frolicking through the woods with 'the lost boys' to gain inspiration for the play. The emotional climaxes at the end are geared to tug at the heart strings, Depp turns in a neat, complex performance, and Dustin Hoffman manages a very wry theatre producer with great humor.

Very faithful adaptation of the J.M. Barrie children's classic novel should delight kids, indeed should inspire them to read the book, but adults may find the film lacking an identity of it's own. The performances, altough fine enough, seem generic like a cartoon, save Lynn Redgrave who does so much with a small role as the kid's London aunt. The flying scenes were rather unspectacular but overall this is a worthy adaptation of the book.

Jason Briggs stuttering monotonous delivery of lines gets tiresome. Christina Ricci's flirting lead lady isn't revealed as anything but a superficial portrayal of what amounts to a not very interesting person. Anything else? Yes, Stockard Channing. as the Mom with a nightclub act is a far more involved character and is wasted to a comedic relief position. When Woody Allen isn't on screen as the cynical mentor of comedy writer Briggs, the weak knees of it seem about to bust. Danny DeVito as the kid's dependent agent is also a welcome relief from the dull young cast. I can't help but expect more from Woody Allen.

Santa Claus is a tough sell. You can't cause him too much peril, because, ... well, because he's Santa Claus. In "The Polar Express", the only conflict that exits is the threat of losing your belief, in Santa Claus. Adults may add their own metaphor. No evil plot to conquer The North Pole, no reindeer catastrophe, no elves picketing for better working conditions, no, this is serious Santa. What we all understand about the famous, "Yes, Virginia, There Is A Santa Claus", newspaper editorial, (it's always been my cynical belief that a brilliant editor made up the letter), is laid out here in bloated bubble-gum fashion. Somehow wallowed in the sentiments and styles of the first half of the 20th Century, the film is about a magical train to The North Pole, and if nothing else, they got the transport right, sometimes the train ride to Santa Land is as redundant as a train ride to Buffalo."The Polar Express" is filmed with animated real actors, apparently playing opposite a 'blue screen', and then swallowed up by it, like that dreadful Aha! video from decades ago, and the effect is like a more mature, thoughtful Gumby, or a decrepit Davy and Goliath, (it was a clay-motion religious children's show in the early '60's, and those who have seen it will never be the same.) Great care is given to detail the facial psychological grimaces of the boy who hops aboard The Polar Express, to see for himself if Santa is real, but the 'extra' kids on the train, seem ridiculously unable to react or interplay with the few speaking characters with dialogue, like if they spoke, the producers would have to pay them imaginary scale, or the animators would have to move their mouths. When a magical train ticket, (nothing is left un-magic-ized), is lost out the window of the train to the wind, the film uses exquisite filming technique to record its journey up mountains, down rivers, free-falling and swirling in snow squalls, and it is a very nice, worthless to the story, bit of Fantasia. Likewise, the boxcar tramp who appears to the boy in times of peril, like a cowboy from heaven, is a nice touch, but the idea, like the tramp, disappears in a puff of smoke.The final North Pole Christmas climax extravaganza, looked to me, given its 1940's heart, like a horrific German youth for Hitler rally, with thousands of elves dominating the city, (mean mothers, too), like a Karl Marx industrial nightmare, and what seemed an entire civilization vowing allegiance to dictator Santa.Suffice to say, "The Polar Express" doesn't compare to the humblest Christmas pageants, say, TV's "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer", which seems to have the same earnest warm Christmas thoughts in mind, and accomplishes the sentiment that The Polar Express, all lights flashing, and whistles blowing, roars through. Will kids like this movie? I think they will. Will they hold it precious through their lives? There's the rub.

Possibly the diary itself should have been excluded in this transition of the Georges Bernanos novel to film. The book allowed the diary passages, which by book's end swelled in emotional intensity, to serve as evidence to the sainthood of the young country priest who believes himself a failure at uplifting the spirit of his depressed parish. Here, the diary passages, although sometimes humanely profound, contol the film systematically as a tool to forward the plot, and never successfully reveal the character.If you've never been moved by French author, Bernanos' powerful book, it's cinema counterpart may seem only dull and religious. If you have taken the book to heart however, there is a lot to admire here. The cold rural atmosphere can be felt like a chill to the bone in the bold, stark, black and white cinematography. The character actors surrounding the priest are a solid wall of antagonizing support. The young priest's joyous motorcycle ride is captured exactly as the book intended, as an unexpected escape from his mundane and painful life.Claude Layduin, in the title role, is often moving as the sole god-fearing man in a village of depraved religious intention, but his wise, godlike stares away from the camera, as if into the mist, upset the ignorance and humility of the character, who never for a moment believes himself to be worthy of God, the essence of the novel.This classic French film seems to be a victim of mixed reviews since it's 1950 premier. It would seem admirers of the book will also admire the film. Those unaware of the novel, may find it's greatest aspects here as well.

A Portuguese woman and her young daughter take a Mediterranean cruise ship while absorbing ancient historic sites and artifacts. Slow moving and clinical, the emotionless dialogue and blase photography forces the viewer to concentrate on the history lesson of western civilization, which evolves into a thematic comfort zone of it's own, until the preposterous climax, sure to incite emotion in the unsuspecting, and sedated viewer. "A Talking Picture" leaves one speechless.

This is about a brother and sister's monogamous relationship and how it relates to other troubled marriages. Writer, Director Tran Anh Hung also directed &quot;The Scent of Green Papaya&quot; which was a spellbound sensual delight with a shattering dramatic climax about a young Vietnamese girl's rise through the glass ceiling of Asian domestic hierarchy. But in &quot;The Vertical Ray of The Sun&quot;, again starring the Director's wife, Tran Nu Yen Khe, he creates a dull psychological drama with an ingratiating attitude towards it's audience, asking us to confront our own judgmental predisposition regarding the on-again, off-again relationships of a group of middle class Asian couples. Visual references to Picasso and American commercial art only reveal a photographer's keen eye as if to serve as commercial interruptions to the weak-kneed drama that muddles in and debates the sanctity of marriage and fidelity. The influence of Western culture is seen as a wind blowing away Asian morals and codes as the siblings wake every morning to the sound of rock group icon &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; playing from a stereo so serenely, one expects a Pepsi-Cola logo to appear on the screen. Very nice to look at but what's the point? Maybe divorce is a political issue in Viet Nam and maybe symbolizing that is the Director's intent. Regardless, when a baby's goos and gaas are subtitled as coherent sentences, as they are here, I suspect the rest of the dialogue as being a more adult version of psycho-babble.

With an adoration for the bluesy rock of The Stones' "Exile On Main Street", and for the boys themselves, (not everybody can so easily name-check 'Sticky Fingers'), Giant Sand's "Swerve" is an offbeat alt-country collage of quirky pop effects, a perfectly unpolished guitar-string-snapping rhythm section, and the quest for the elusive butterfly of love, seen here as emotional money in the bank, which we're told in the first track, "Can't Find Love", can't be found "in ten minutes, not in a half of hour". There's an obligatory, eyeball in the headlights Dylan cover, (Every Grain of Sand), some '60s electric organ mini-jams, and a fine youth-forever philosophy of adult harboring of naked emotion in the country rock twang of "Trickle Down System", - "When we were younger/we were more like purveyors/perverse and purposeful and full of neglect/These days we've been reduced to surveyors/more severe, more soulful/and acutally capable of some respect." Yeah, I respect this. And the philosophy that people who live in sandcastles shouldn't make waves. Unless it's not a problem to float gently out to sea.

Civil War yarn longs to be epic in scope but remains an elaborate love story with Nicole Kidman waiting on new-found beau Jude Law to return from the war. The early battle scenes exhibit an authentic air and a scene with deserters being stung in a house of prostitution gives the film an unexpected horrific edge. The film's resolution, although intense, seems off-hand and pointless. The movie seems intent on avoiding a happy ending.

Odd, sometimes nearly unlistenable redundant melody pop that is so blatantly stripped to it's 'Pop Goes the Weazil' bare bones, it's like listening to a big budget Kareoki act with guitar. &quot;Psycho Wing&quot; is particularly bizarre and manages to keep a woman laughing maniacally throughout it's eight minutes. She also does a wierd terror-filled roller-coaster shrill scream which I sort of like. So bouncy-bouncy, the beat doesn't roll, it gravitates.

Land developers preying on naive and worldly-wise landowners in Florida isn't the most original idea, indeed it sounds dated, but this ensemble comedy-drama from Writer-Director John Sayles is as engaging as a warm ocean breeze on your favorite Floridian beach. All the interlocking stories of the potentially wealthy residents are entertaining and amusing but the film really belongs to Angela Bassett and James McDaniel as a woman returning to her home town with her husband, half-heartedly willing to confront unresolved family affairs and relationships. They provide a strong backbone to this gentle and funny film.

Every now and then you come across a work, say a movie, a book, a piece of music, which moves you so entirely, you will never look at life quite the same ever again. SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, the DVD, a staged production of the Stephen Sondheim, James Lapine Broadway musical is an unconventional show, sometimes more in the tradition of a Gilbert & Sullivan opera, in that the music is truly, as joked in the musical's book, 'variations on a theme'; one long sweep of music that climaxes in a powerful finale, bound to shake up the heart, and enlighten the mind.The synopsis of the play is bound to chase some away, as it did me for many years. It is a fictional account of real life 19th Century Parisian artist, Georges Seurat, and his attempts to finish his masterwork, "Sunday Afternoon On The Isle of La Grande Jatte", as the Paris art community ridicules the work in progress, and stands defiantly against the finished piece. During Act 2, you are rudely whisked away 100 years into the future, where a monstrous piece of art; a metallic iron lung, shell-like object, is beaming laser beams and playing new age-like music to a less than enthusiastic crowd of artists and would-be admirers. It is the work of the great grandson of Georges Seurat, who faces the same doubt and betrayal from his peers.The sad history of the artwork, brought to the front in a matter-of-fact way during a presentation during Act 2, in which aged daughter, (Bernadette Peters), and great grandson, (Mandy Pantinkin), recount the likes of Renoir and other famous painters of the era, retracting their entries into an art exhibit when it is learned, "Sunday Afternoon On The Isle...", would be included, brings characteristic emotional depth to the painting which is now regarded as a treasured piece of art, and indeed the painting is the star of the show, even taking a majestic bow during the closing curtain call.It sounds dry, but this is all very light-hearted, with traditional musical comedy amusements, which surmount to a power sucker punch of sadness, humanity and beauty, as the cast gathers for the final song. Get out your handkerchiefs. The cast is exemplary; Mandy Pantinkin delivers an alarmingly spiritualized tenor proclaiming the beauty of art, sure to send shivers your way, and Bernadette Peters, is aglow with an empathetic characterization, full of conviction and grace, rarely realized in a musical.Just a quibble. An annoying, but tolerable 'feed-front', (the dialogue is heard just slightly before it is spoken, it seems to happen often in these taped DVDs), can be heard distractingly at the quiter moments. Mandy Pantinkin, Bernadette Peters, Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine provide audio commentary.

If The Beach Boys represented the '60's teen spirit of west coast fun in the sun, Tommy James and The Shondells were the teens sniffing glue behind the garage in a grungier, urban America. From the definitive 'garage rock' of their first hit record, the all-ages appealing, "Hanky Panky", to their expanding forays into psychedelia in "Crinsom and Clover", and "Sweet Cherry Wine", Tommy James and The Shondells released a string of AM radio favorites that brought a sense of maturity to the power pop teen market of the era, say the massive middle ground between the The Archies and The Beatles. "I Think We're Alone Now", with it's instantly recognizable thumping bass opening, tamborine, and searing vocal, "Children behave ...", is urgent and earnest in it's desperation, with a cool electric crickets chirping effect at it's most seductive moment. "Mony Mony", and "Do Something To Me", may be the best fake audience participation party records ever produced, the former working itself into a perfect musical frenzy. "Crinsom and Clover" is still a beautiful mind gazing slice of psychedelia, (unfortunately, for a fairly thorough compilation, this anthology doesn't include the 'long version' of Crinsom and Clover; no groovy wah-wah pedal solo), and "Crystal Blue Persuassion", christens the peace movement meets drug culture era in a soft and dreamy bongo tapping blue-eyed soul classic. There is a lot of filler here, a hit and miss barrage of teen idol-like B sides, and psychedelic misfires, but the hits far outweigh them; "Ball of Fire", and "Sugar on Sunday", are welcome reminders of the versatile pop the group was capable of, and the 27 tracks conclude with Tommy James big solo hit, the infectious rock and white soul of, "Draqgin' the Line". James possessed a fine distinctive vocal control merging screech and howl range with soft pleading minister style, a perfect complexity based on early rhythm and blues, that holds its own today against the best blue-eyed soul singers. I would surely like to see his name on the concert comeback circuit. The CD includes an extensive history of the band.

Caustic Resin sound like a postmortem Creedance Clearwater Revival spiked with a lunatic Hank Williams and blessed with a singing cowboy's sense of balladry. Mind you, this is rock at it's purest drenched in guitar drone and vocal manipulation, haunting and wailing lyrics, and song hooks that strangle. "Message To Shareholders" is a wrenching blast of Brett Netson's vocals and guitar that sounds like being trapped against a wall while a ferocious animal drools in your face. "Fry Like Ace Jones", with it's romantic western tinged dramatics, sounds like your executioner breaking out into a pretty sundown-y ballad just before he drops the floor out from under you. At first, the title track, "Keep On Truckin" (omit Eddie Kendricks from your mind), is an elaborate commercial sounding "All the Young Dudes" worship anthem, on repeated listens, it sounds like the band making a melodic attempt to reach a genuine musical scale with mock rock star Netson passing around shares of rock and roll idolization as he nearly croons and howls masterfully a swirling blend of pop and delusion. It's been a while since an album has put me away like this. On the inside of the lo-frills CD cover is an interior photo of the band's 'tour bus'. It's the same vehicle I saw parked just outside the door of the small club where I saw Caustic Resin play in Buffalo, New York a few years ago; an eyesore of a van loaded to the brim with the stuff bag ladies dream of, looking like a 1972 time warp through an Iraqui war zone. I thought, some hippies must have driven in from the hills and they'll be lucky if the cops don't come and haul this heap away.

Aretha's classic rhythm and blues album is gospel tinged soul with the Queen belting out a handful of remakes and the co-written, "Think", a feisty supercharged personal and social call for freedom, with a stinging chorus forever imbedded on listener's conscienceness. Sometimes the 1968 code of hit-making ethics find her lungs a bit constrained when you know she just wants to wail her church trained voice and make the song her own, like in Burt Bacharach and Hal David's "I Say A Little Prayer", and Sam Cooke's "You Send Me", fine songs and fine renditions, but just not the excitement of a Franklin single. As her career moves on, she gets better and better, and this is a fine place to start.

It's more than unplugged, it's completely uninvolved. 'Laid back' is the tone this video would like to convey, but interviewer UFO researcher, David Sereda, and subject, Dan Aykroyd, are so casual, they may as well be discussing who won the Mets game. It's difficult to discuss such fantastic subjects without striking a nerve somewhere, but this documentary manages just that, seeming more intent on showing just how normal, (and dull), a paranormal believer can be. We like Aykroyd using his celebrity status to bring the UFO phenomena to the talking tables, (it sure is more sincere than weight-loss programs, and orphaned African children), but his rather unconvincing account of a 'men in black' encounter, and his lung polluting, chain smoking cigarettes inhaled into his very overweight rotund figure, while discussing how the U.S. Government is destroying the world's natural environment, verges on SNL satire.

Famed writer Oscar Wilde languishes in prison on a sodomy conviction while a prisoner chorus line struts by, a hard-nosed warden appears in outrageous drag, scenes from his works reveal themselves in a psychedelic hue, mother reminisces, and his oppressed wife visits with increasingly depressing news, all while the day to day grind of prison labors on. This play, written by Adrian Hall and Richard Cumming, part of the Broadway Theatre Archive series, and culled from PBS's "Theatre In America" is an extraordinary mess of straight drama and surreal imaginings that collectively present a coherent study of the great writer's time in Reading Gaol prison. Richard Kneeland, as Wilde, perfectly channels the writer's fears and bewilderment of society's understanding of acceptable behavior and his own eccentric convictions. And he's constantly funny, mouthing out Wilde witticisms like a second language: "To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as misfortunate; to lose both looks like carelessness."

I doze off for all of three seconds watching David Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, and it must have been a crucial three seconds, for when I looked back at the screen, I was as lost as a character out of Lynch's amnesiac LOST HIGHWAY. We can go on about the freedom an artist possesses to express himself, (Lynch worked without any studio interference on INLAND), and how an empty cinematic plate is to the film director what an empty canvas is to an artist, but when all is said and done, boring is boring is boring, and boy oh boy, this is boring. I don't need a linear plotline to keep me attentive to a Lynch film, the music, sound, and images can speak to me on a level more rewarding than a story line, but just how many times were we to watch Laura Dern's (producer and star), character, walk down a dark Lynchian hall way, and slowly open a secret door to reveal another secret hallway and another secret door, and another, and another, ... in the meantime we get every Lynch trick and treat known to film, (men talking in silly voices, cigarettes burning holes in the sky, neighbors with clairvoyant messages, etc.), losing impact like an unfinished highway, without however, a silent dwarf, whose appearence may have signaled the close of this murky film, and with, a TV studio sitcom of two-footed, human-like, living room rabbits, which become a welcome relief of familiarity and order, when interrupting Dern's endless bewildered quest.The way I see it, in Lynch's vision of INLAND EMPIRE, there is an imperfect parallel universe fighting each other for survival, and such conflict is the cause of all violence in the world. It's as good an idea as the snake tempting Eve with the apple. So we have Alice, (Dern), not so much falling down a rabbit hole, as being dragged through one, and then things get peculiar and peculier. The film often drifts towards a group of T & A gifted women, (picture a poverty stricken Spice Girls), who may be the victims of assault and murder, and may be consoling Dern's character in an afterlife, or a parallel universe, or posssibly they're really there in Dern's apartment, lying around like a Penthouse photo shoot and dancing to Little Eva's "Locomotion". Or maybe they're just a delusion. Or maybe they're simply the biggest T's and the best A's ever seen in a Lynch film.Cameos galore here; Bill H. Macy, Diane Ladd, (Laura Dern's mom), Nastassja Kinski; you just want to stop one of them and say, do something before you leave! Don't leave me alone with Laura! I can't bear another handsome close-up and dreary speech! What about those rabbits? Why not bring The Spice Girls into the rabbit sitcom? That might work. Hugh Hefner could enter and say, "It's just a rabbit, dear."I'm out the door of the theatre and there's a sidewalk sign from the club next door reading, HALF-PRICE COCKTAILS WITH MOVIE TICKET STUB. I am SO there, and in pure Lynchian fashion, me and the dwarf enter our own parallel universe.

Whimsical soundtrack to the 1967 Mike Nichol's film blends the foxtrot generation with the soft-core hippie music of '60s Simon and Garfunkel. Hence, you get the folkish and electric versions of "Sounds of Silence" alongside '40s cocktail lounge big band that sounds like your local TV station holding a telethon, and a hot striptease blues number, (in the film it's when Dustin Hoffman takes Katharine Ross to a strip joint), with blazing sax and rolling drum solo. The centerpiece here is Simon's traditional English folk, "Scarborough Fair", with it's precise musicbox harpsichord sounding impossibly perfect. And, where have you gone, "Mrs. Robinson"? Only the first altered stanza is found here, as it was in the movie.

Australian outback western covers the genre's traditional story and gunplay well, while never being cliche, but by sundown, the stunning, blazing yellow and red cinematography, and Australian folk inspired music, by alternative rocker Nick Cave, who also wrote the screenplay, lingers fresher in the mind than the gritty bad guy vs. bad guy, earnest and crudely violent history lesson of Australia in the late 19th Century. It boasts concern for the inhumane treatment of the aborigines of Australia, who suffered a similiar history as that of African Americans in the U.S., with reminders via vintage historical photographs depicting an enslaved people, but the film is mostly indebted to Charly Burns, (Guy Pearce), a member of the notorious Burns brothers, who is given a 'proposition' by the local lawman, to ride out into the outback to kill his older brother, or his younger brother, held in the jailhouse, will be hung. A bit much to ask of him, and us, the audience, and while it tries to create a doom mongering cowboy mission full of mysticism and rocky plateau sunsets, it becomes less interesting, and less rewarding, the closer he gets to his objective, with little, if any moral conflict. It's glistening red, fresh kill violence, isn't nearly as objectionable as the lawman's wife character, who spends the entirety of the film dreading the thought of rape.

My "TV Classics Westerns" is a 2 DVD set with both Volumes 3 and Volume 4, currently sold on Amazon as seperate volumes.Saddle 'em up pardner and hit the trail of 1950s television where the hero is never less than perfect, certainly never complex, distinguished by the bad guys who are always as mean and ruthless as a springing rattlesnake. Before a television violence code turned westerns into dull character studies (Gunsmoke), they were shooting each other up, punching each other into head concussions, and employing bullets through the hearts of them varmint bank robbers, cattle rustlers, and law killers who always clutch their hearts after being shot, cry out, and die at the feet of the smirking god-like law abider. What refreshing violence. The code of the west preached in each and every episode here is, "Kill! Kill! Kill!". All so that peacefull minded Americans can live fearlessly in the name of freedom. Yahoo!OK, smirk if you will, that The Lone Ranger (Clayton Moore) and Tonto (Jay Silverheels), spent all their time alone roaming the west and looking for a place to camp for the evening. They were simply exhausted after a long day of thwarting train robberies, chasing stagecoaches over cliffs, and galloping into oblivion. And every now and then a cry of "Hi Ho Silver!" could be heard from a campfire somewhere in the west. I'll have none of your Abe Lincoln theories of weird costumes and masks. I hear The William Tell Overture, (you may swear allegiance at this time, it excitedly opened every episode), and there is The Lone Ranger (at the beginning of every episode), perched on a cliff like a surveying hawk, eyeing the wide open west as if saying, "If so much as a mouse moves, I'm going to be there." And then a fantastic voice-over narration proclaiming our hero to be, among other things, a "marvelous" guy. Tightly knotted story lines would not fly over the head of a dull 5 year old. Clayton Moore's strange straddling walking gait, like John Wayne in a tutu, may throw impressionable young minds temporarily out of whack. The next generation of kids will grow up with Mr. Rogers. Go figure. Did you know that in the hundreds of episodes of "The Lone Ranger", he never killed a man? He just wounded them and hauled them off to the law, and they would kill them. What a guy.There's one episode of "U.S. Marshall" here, a modern day Arizona western formerly called "The Sherriff of Conchise", a syndicated show not affiliated with a television network, and the episode is a hoot, with Jack Lord (Hawaii 5-O) guest starring as a violently crazed felon scheming to escape from the penetentiary. This guy's so mean, when asked by a desperate fellow inmate for just a puff of his cigarette, he says, sure, and proceeds to put the cigarette out in the poor guy's hand as he screams in agony. I laughed so hard I spilled coffee all over my Lone Ranger jammies.Finally there's eight episodes of "Stories of The Century", an Emmy winning, also syndicated western, telling the tales of Matt Clark, Railroad Detective (he introduces himself just like that - "Matt Clark, Railroad Detective") played by Jim Davis, who played Jock Ewing on "Dallas". The serious minded adult show boasts it's story ideas were taken from newspaper archives and records from the 1890s, and it's authenticity is impressive as the sun goes down on true life notorious outlaws like Billy The Kid, The Dalton Gang, and Jesse James in each episode.Happy Trails.

Gulf War Marines are watching an old war movie in a Marine base theatre just prior to deployment to The Gulf War, and are whooping, hollering, and cheering their compatriots on like frenzied spectators at a college football game. Just one day in the life of a Gulf War Marine, and "Jarhead", effectively uses this common perspective of your average joe, in a less than glorious war, standing tall, armored and prepared, but mostly disallusioned and bored, as action sought is never found, and the blood of the enemy never tasted. Indeed, these Marines fill in the missing gaps of glory with their own personal triumphs and trauma, even firing rounds of ammunition into the empty desert night sky as closure to a war they hadn't entirely witnessed. There is almost nothing in "Jarhead", that hasn't been seen in other war movies, yet these stock wartime scenes and situations stand like pillar stones to a war secured before it even began by American manipulative control, (the same could not be said about the current Iraqui situation.). While there are several ugly conflict induced scenes in "Jarhead", the film does not bombard with the horrors of war, but instead, asks us to consider our current politically aggressive state, while preserving our regard for the soldiers committed to carrying out America's decisions. As one sharp-shooter in the film puts it, "Let's leave politics out of it. We're here. That's what really matters." And while "Jarhead' doesn't particularly make you proud to be an American, it makes you proud of our American soldiers. The film has a glistening yellow napalm sky meeting white desert sand beauty to it, and performances by lead Jake Gyllenhaal, as your typical home town hero, who says he's a Marine because he got lost on his way to college, and Jamie Foxx, as a Bible-reading, god-spitting Staff Seargent regulation guy, are as strong and reserved as you could expect from a fighting Marine. As for escalating drama and eye-popping action and adventure, you'll have to rent an old war movie for that. This is the real stuff.

&quot;Sandinista&quot; is in response to a Central American conflict in the late 70's, in which a leftist army overthrew a Democraticic government with ties to America. The Clash, confirmed Socialists, celebrated the Sandinistan victory with this mammoth telephone directory of oddball songs and political ya-hoo that filled 6 sides of vinyl when first released. The new Sandinistan government fell back into Democratic hands only a few years later and &quot;Sandinista&quot; is as flippant and buoyant as such political conflicts. The Clash are thieves dancing around a campfire outside the circle of victory with the smallest cache. Any political ideology evaporates into Joe Strummer's weary daydream of what it would be like to be just anybody. There's a sweetness here, the dream of the tired rebel in &quot;Rebel Waltz&quot;, a romantic image of victory that swells into heaven-like bliss, a soulfullness in &quot;Charlie Don't Surf&quot; with a California beach guitar conjuring a gorgeous night-time surf, an immediacy and rhythmic tranquility in &quot;Living in Fame&quot;, a railtrain piercing the fading tracks in &quot;Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)&quot;... No, I wouldn't be without &quot;Sandinista&quot;, the mesmerizing ugly sister of &quot;London Calling&quot;. It's like receiving political pamphlets from the sky from a million dollar jet as victory is declared in Ding-dong-ville.

I fear someone involved with the making of this film knows the real Jacques Cousteau, and is telling it like it was. "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou", is 60's landmark TV's "The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau", seen through a psychedelic prism, into an alternative underwater world where drinks are tipped, pot is smoked, sharks are hunted down for revenge, and the underwater exotics are revealed as childlike-drawn animated caricatures. Like the baby boomers in this film, I'm a little troubled that the scientific, fatherly Cousteau, patrolling the ocean depths in his cool submarine, discovering aquatic wonders and mysterious marine life, may have been more a manic Square Pants Sponge Bob, than the man most likely to seriously fulfill a Mr. Limpit fantasy. Granted, this film isn't ABOUT Jacques Cousteau, but then, why was it even made, if not to reveal the Hollywood cocktail stories that likely were told about him and his underwater expeditions? So be it. If you have a soft spot in your gill for Cousteau, you have to admire it. It seems you can catch a sea breeze of the real man somewhere in the chaos. It's scenic, funny, bizarre, and although it suffers from the dreaded, 'just-how-long-is-this-movie?' reach for the DVD cover, you can't easily look away. I suppose I object to the tragic consequences befalling the only young, virile character, and the pirates invading the ship seemed too brutal, but we need be reminded what beautiful melodies David Bowie writes, and the acoustic Portuguese versions of his songs were exceptional.Now, I wonder just how much I can get for my Junior Club Membership to The Jacques Cousteau Society on ebay.

Very fine adaptation of the William Inge play with Shirley Booth in an Oscar winning performance as a middle-aged, childless woman, whose husband, (Burt Lancaster), is about to hop off the alcoholic's wagon. Unlike two other Hollywood filmings of Inge plays; "Picnin", and "Bus Stop", "Come Back Little Sheba", finds little reason to expand its horizons for film's sake, and sticks close to the drawing board, concentrating on the subtle, brewing drama that finally erupts in an angry alcoholic's rage. Lancaster's transition from devoted Alcoholics Anonymous member to raving lunatic is superb, and the two young supporting players, Terry Moore and Richard Jaeckel, are surprsingly deft and accomplished as teens in love, in contrast to the passive and hardened relationship of the middle-agers. Shirley Booth delivers a dazzling, emotionally engulfing portrait of a woman clutching love, her borderline manic character is genuinely empathetic. The only problem, and one that occurs to me every time I read the play, is the suggestion that a kitchen knife holds the answer to the fate of the missing dog, Sheba. I don't think it was the playwright's intention to envision Burt Lancaster carving up the cute little poodle, but every time he picks up that knife and lunges at his wife, I expect to find little poodle chops in the freezer.

It seems to be filled with nasty Hollywood inside jokes that are never shared with the public. A scene with a take on Hitchcock's Cary Grant disrupting a private funeral service seems strangely real. Another, with our man English demanding a secret message written on someones's body be revealed, is hilarious in a psychotic sort of way. Often it is only typical of the spy spoof genre but when it is funny, it is very funny.

This film is as earnest as a Mark Trails nature comic book adventure, but in telling the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who abandons convention and a promising career to hitchhike and live in the Alaskan wilderness, director Sean Penn, films a beautiful movie void of psychological or spiritual conviction, even while gorgeous landscapes, eagles soaring against the Alaskan sun, oddball eccentric Ameriana road characters pepper in, and a genuine empathy prevails for McCandless' compulsion to walk into the wild woods. There is a nagging doubt that underneath this nature loving idealist, who disappears without a trace to embark on his adventure, lies a malice aimed at his concerned family who live in grief for years unknowing of his whereabouts and fate.In fact, Penn's inistence to include the McCandless family, (professional, upper-scale, worried sick about their missing son), prominently in the narrative is a superflous reminder of the past when a few well chosen words of dialogue would prevail. We want the great Alaskan wilderness adventure, and while we get that, we also get a whole lot of generation gap family soap which is suspect to significance. Scenes like the cap-throwing college graduation do little but make this a very long movie.We feel for McCandless in much the same way we feel for "Grizzly Man',the psycholgically leveraging photographer who also went into the Alaskan wilderness, believing he could commune with the wild bears, but instead was eaten by them. Likewise McCandless had severe mental issues, that went beyond the call of the wild, in luring him to a wilderness camp where he was inept at hunting and eating wild game, unable to tell a poisonous plant from an edible one, and lived in an abandoned bus begging for a lead paint intolerance. Penn's god-like vistas of the great wilderness are in innoculated contrast to the frail, doomed, self renamed Alexander Supertramp.I expected to love this movie, and while I never even disliked it, (it's a cabin in the woods thing), in retrospect, the haunting image of the real McCandless at the end of the film, leaves him a sad and nearly pathetic man. Is this the intention of the film? To wonder what he was really running away from? When I was 19, I packed a bag and walked and hitchhiked the continental U.S. from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. I too was looking for something but I trust it was not a desire to become a second-rate Thoreau. The film refuses to speculate on where McCandless' intention lied, or where his pain began. It has however conjured in me an absolute respect for him. In peace, bro -

If ever a musical comeback was due, it belongs to Sly and the Family Stone, who have been silent as a stone for too many years as this excellent package reminds us. That funky beat, rude horns, inter-racial harmonies and an unlikely fuzz-tone guitar brought pop culture to it's knees in the late '60s and was the first rock and roll outfit to successfully cross over to mainstream pop while remaining true to it's black soul heritage. At a time when The Supremes were wearing white-inspired mile high hair-dos, Sly and the Family Stone were a shocking rebelious sight with wild colorful mod American garb and blonde hair on dark skin. Those wonderful politically astute, radio friendly pop songs are all here plus some early soul recordings that gives hints of the magic to come. I was glad to find "Somebody'a Watching You" on the disc, being familiar with the dark paranoic but haunting and lovely Little Sister version (I believe, a Sly family off-shoot artist) here is the original Sly song in a much lighter vein bringing a playful tolerance to the big brother theme. "The Essential Sly and The Family Stone" is excellent and historical popular music. It makes one crave for more of Sly Stone's work in music.

Comically angry, abrasive, and a bit cluttered "Fishbone" album is not without the cool whimsey, genuine social comment, and tight ska-rock-soul musical excellence that is Fishbone, a band that gets more respect than it does recognition for their powerhouse rocking assault on the ears and for staying true to their original concept; great music and something philosophical about a fishbone. I love the hard rock edge, the ska horns, and Angelo Moore's political, wild and crazy guy poet's rants and raves. Here we have Chim Chim the monkey, a metaphorical Fishbone, joyfully lashing out at social disorder, white rock and roll guys (with tvs in their ears and eyes), the pressure to hip-hop, and happy-go-lucky substance abuse; the song "Alcoholic" really sounds like a walk from the bar to the alley and back to the bar. Fishbone create a real homey, family insider feeling for the listener, one feels a part of this not hip-hop but not without bop alternative musical ensemble. Chim Chim, however, like a pet monkey gone violently beserk, needs a few sessions in anger management as some of these songs go on just a bit too long, like Angelo Moore is really, really mad about something.

Somewhere in their career, someone rolled The Clash into a recording studio and produced &quot;London Calling&quot;, and the rest is human history. Producer Guy Stevens techno wizardry creates a freshly tarred, wall-to-wall stereophonic slice of happy pop culture stomping on shaky ground. This is 'The Clash' with a dollar pinned under their ear and lavish lip-licking commercialism in the briefcase. My original vinyl record even had a secret message. At the end of each four sides of vinyl, scratched in the ending groove were the consecutive words, TEAR-DOWN-THE-WALL. It was the year of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; and you couldn't get away from the hit single, &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;.

The extra live tracks from this Buffalo based punk influenced band seem like another band entirely, a more assured, slightly deranged sound somewhere between garage punk and dirt-glam progessive. The studio tracks suffer from an inferior sound quality where guitar and vocals sound hollow, high and above the cool background wash of music. I like the Count Chocula and Boo-Berry samples, and the lead vocals, at first indiscriminate and anonymous, become familiar and friendly like running into a good old friend on a city street. Great band name, maybe from a 1970s Saturday morning cartoon, and perfect homage to The Clash's "Garageland" in the live track, "Lower East Side".

Fifty years from now, pop culturalists will be going ga-ga over a quirky Saturday morning kiddie cartoon that starred a thing from another world and a young American girl with a penchant for the darker side of life. The animation is fine and imaginative but tv cheap, it's the great scripts and honest delivery of the actors involved that make this so enjoyable. A saturday morning kid's show that suggests to kids to embrace their darker side, and to have concern for the 'beetlejuices' of our world.

In many ways, it's typical of an old fashioned Hollywood biography except for the homosexual aspect of Cole Porter's life, which remains old fashioned in that all the homosexuals are depicted as if they just stepped off a bus from Sodom and Gomorah. I hate to say it but Kevin Kline was simply too old to play the young Cole Porter. Except for an exhausting boyish charm, no attempt was made to make him look like a younger man. He fared much better as the old Cole Porter although then he looked strangely like Carl Reiner. Ashley Judd, as his long compliant wife is lovely but her constant staunch characterization finally comes full circle with the Columbia Motion Pictures lady with the torch. Surely there was something this woman was doing about her mostly sexless marriage besides smoking cigarettes. In depicting Cole Porter's songs, rockers Alanis Morissette, Elvis Costello, and Sheryl Crow should have been given their pink slips as soon as they opened their mouths. They are not versatile singers and their renditions are of butchery. I couldn't imagine that Elvis Costello could look any more ridiculous than he already does. Was is that he's doing, the frug dance from the '60s? Now that I got that off my chest, I really enjoyed this film. It's a neat glitzy melodrama. But I now have a strange desire to watch Judy Garland in "A Star Is Born". Now there's a great fictitious biography!

I probably would never have seen "Shrek 2", if someone didn't force me to watch it recently, and it's a handsomely produced ugly duckling-in-reverse fairy tale boasting a smart sense of humor and enormously creative production values. As funny and enjoyable as it was though, the story itself is a little vacant, dependent on the crafty characterizations and animated effects. The celebrity voices have been deservedly praised but so too should be the unknowns who apparently acted out these scenes in human form before they were turned to animation.

&quot;Strings&quot; is romance, or romantic orchestration substituting and proving more rewarding than the concept of love, illusion being more longstanding than reality. So inspires Kristin Hersh (Throwing Muses) in this eight-song EP compact disc which provides dark, beautiful cello and violin chamber music to Hersh's morning misted lyrical landscape of broken love remedied by nature. Her absent lover in &quot;Strings&quot; is embodied by environmental song title themes as, &quot;Beesting&quot;, &quot;A Loon&quot;, and &quot;Sundrops&quot;. The quest, or avoidance of human relationships is the fuel that keeps the fire burning as in &quot;Me and My Charms&quot;, in which she sings, &quot;When I kiss an angel, I have a piece of you&quot;. But only a piece, she avoids the commitment of relationship and accepts the earth, moon, sun, and angels as her own. The strings on &quot;Strings&quot; are luscious full-bodied breaths of classical music, much like &quot;The Brodsky Quartet's&quot; work with Elvis Costello, but Hersh plays a strikingly sharp acoustic guitar as well, which accompanies the brooding strings like day and night. Her rendition of Led Zepplin's &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot;. which concludes the disc, is closer in heart to the American folk ballads that inspired it and sounds genuinely bluegrass.

Strange tale about interwoven lives surrounding a heart transplant recipient works very well despite a super tragic incident which serves as the movie's centerpiece and garners the audience's attention and sympathy. A woman's family is killed while crossing a street by a drunk driver and she slowly and methodically seeks revenge with the help of her dead husband's heart transplant recipient. Sounds preposterous but it unfolds believably and becomes a genuine think piece that never resorts to heart bludgeoning measures, given the very emotional circumstances involved.

It was much to bear to watch the eleven Israeli athletes of the 1972 Olympic Games slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists, just as they had primed their young bodies and minds to a state of physical strength and endurance in Stephen Spielberg's, "Munich", but the carnage doesn't stop there, and if you brace yourself for the awful scenes of the athlete's assassinations, you still have to endure the slow death walk and gurgling bleed of a half naked enemy spy prostitute, and other agonizing deaths which possess a morbid fascination, the kind teenagers in the horror flick audience would find, "cool", and "awesome". It's often a Night of The Very Nearly Living Dead, as gunshot victims momentarily carry out their final acts, as if unaware of bullet holes through their foreheads and chests, until blood protrudes from them like ketchup released from a stuck bottle. Why this fascination with gore, is beyond me. Maybe it serves as companion to the horrific details of the film's inspiration, suggesting the expectations and perpetual motion of the Istraeli athletes were snuffed like a spent Olympian torch.It's a difficult film, given it's "inspired by true events" lead-in. With a free hand to examine the Munich execututions, Spielberg delivers an assured sense of actuality in depicting the State of Israel, seeking revenge against, as opposed to overwhelming, terrorism, and in finding the revenge seeking, justice fighters greatly outclassed in the world of high end spies and assassins. Their secret mission is exposed a number of times due to emotion level tactics, they fall prey to an obvious, seductive counter-assassin, they harbor a mole, and offer outragous sums of money to contacts for information. They mostly 'get their man', so to speak, but we could have told them the cost of terrorism is more terrorism.Without the historic events, "Munich" would make a fantastic espionage thriller. In detailing the history with a flair for the sensational, Spielberg has given us a cloudy, but forceful impression of the Munich assassinatiions, leaving us with the suggestion that all is not well in the course of history. As The World Trade Center towers in the New York City skyline via trick photography near film's end, Spielberg tells us, history will repeat itself. His film's main objective is the conclusion that America did not do enough to support Israel's sense of justice regarding the Munich assassinations.Anyway you look at it, it's a film that shouldn't be missed.

Intriguing premise of America's forefathers leaving secret clues to a hidden treasure is given the kiddie comic book treatment in this fun, and tedious, adventure saga. A little more intellect wouldn't have gone amiss, and discerning viewers may mutter to themselves long into the second hour, "Just find the damn treasure already!". Nicholas Cage has a 'Romantic treasure hunter? No problem.' conviction and Diane Kruger brings excitement and appeal to her role as a rigid historian turned Santa Claus believer, but the whole lot of treasure hunters and the bad guys chasing them begin to resemble the cartoon cast from the "Scooby-Doo" cartoons, complete with Scooby-like chase van. Not a bad thing if you're twelve years old, but like a crummy free toy in your sweetened and forteified cereal box if you're not.

Dependent on it's moody likable Inspector Montalbano whose Sicilian mannerisms and bohemian lifestyle carry and lie at the heart of this mystery, &quot;The Terra-Cotta Dog&quot; is a leisurely and fascinating journey through the streets and countryside of Sicily as the Inspector solves a mystery of preserved corpses found in a cave. It's the Inspector's love of art and music, his disdain and attraction to modern media, and his commitment to fine Italian cuisine which keeps these pages turning as the mystery itself brews as tempting as a slow cooked pasta sauce. The excitement wanes a bit as the book propels into climax which amounts to a conversation resolving all issues, but it's the time spent with the reserved yet crusty and good-hearted Inspector which makes &quot;The Terra-Cotta Dog&quot; so enjoyable.

My favorite progressive rock band from the 1970s as money grubbing spoiled rock stars? Yes? No! The author certainly loves the band but reveals them as quite human after all, blowing the lid off the Yes mystique of cosmic peace and mind altering exploration, as they scramble to keep pace with changing public musical tastes and advancing middle age. Even after reading &quot;Close To The Edge, The Story of Yes&quot;, the band members remain as strangers coming across as mere participants in the great machine called Yes, and as less than mature men who blame all their troubles on everyone but themselves. The author's narrative rolls along serving Yes information, however tedious to the unadorned, in an enjoyable way until the end when he suddenly dropa out of sight allowing the concluding chapter to serve as a promotion for the band's new album. One wonders if the band's participation for the book was dependent on that promotion.

The title track is still awful. You can hear a real rock song trying to emerge from the sappy rhythm and lush orchestration of it, but the powers that be Peter Frampton in 1977 preferred targeting what we used to call teeny-boppers, (a rather obscene description of youth), and offering them a lullabye into puberty, and suddenly ace guitarist of Humble Pie, cult hero of Frampton's Camel, and shared generational icon of "Frampton Comes Alive", was a teen idol poster boy. It seems at the same time, he appeared decked out in medals and awards on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine, starred in that awful Sgt. Pepper Bee Gees movie, (where was Michael Jackson's monopoly on popular music rights when we needed it?), and if my memory serves me correctly, didn't he also host the first, and last, Rock Music Awards on television? For all I know he was the center square on Hollywood Squares as well. It was as if Frampton came alive and then it was right back to the crypt. But listening to "I'm In You" after nearly 30 years, (terrible track, terrible title, terrible album cover), ... it's really not so bad. In a way it's as modest and unassuming as his solo work pre-'Comes Alive'. "Putting My Heart On The Line', and "Won't You Be My Friend?", are irrisistably catchy tracks, the former led with a harmonious talking guitar effect, the latter a funky and bluesy melody and beat with a down home slide guitar twang. The covers seem unecessary but both "(I'm A) Road Runner", and "Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)", are fine rock testimonials, and when he insists on a love ballad; "You Don't Have To Worry", "St. Thomas (Don't You Know How I Feel)", the results aren't nearly as doomed to love as the title track, indeed often thoughtful and rhythmic. All in all though, this just isn't what we expected, or wanted after the rock and roll party atmosphere of "Frampton Comes Alive", the little girl demographic targets were steering away from the guitar heads and rock buffs who had supported his career, until he was all but inaccessable and surrounded by a career making machine. I remember the irony well, at the height of the 'Comes Alive!' tour, I was eating at a resteraunt with my girlfriend when who but Peter Frampton and an entire entourage of people sat down a few tables away. We didn't want to be crass and ask for an autograph, but decided to stop at his table on the way out, to tell him how much we enjoyed his music and that we had tickets to his concert the following night. As we stopped to offer our well wishes, the whole table of business-like people surrounding the great guitarist, looked up at us in such intimidating silence and expectation, we couldn't utter a sound. We just stood there as if in awe. I, in fact, sort of snarled, and my girlfriend sort of hissed, and then we shuffled along. It was as if there was no penetrating Frampton's family of friends.

In this most recent installment of the British sitcom, the simple task of redoing the kitchen becomes a nightmare for Edina, (Jennifer Saunders), who sees a design in her mind's eye she can't seem to share with the world. She comes to believe her dream kitchen may be the product of one of her self-professed past lives. So let the hilarity begin.There's a lot of AbFab schtick here; best friend Patsy, (Joanna Lumley), has another biological disorder and is equipped with a body fluid draining tube dangling from her person, (she puts the external end into a glass to preserve the alcohol); ex-husband Marshall and partner Bo, (Christopher Ryan, Mo Gaffney), make an obligatory appearance on the run from the FBI, as if doing a quick shuffle and soft shoe and then exit, and guest Nathan Lane offers a hammy and unfunny performance as an eccentric interior designer, verifying that with all it's comedic rule, AbFab is incapable of creating an equally strong comedic male character.But like another reviewer suggested concerning the impending demise of the program, I would like to follow Edina and Patsy far into the future to that final snort and sip. When this episode is funny, it is hysterical. Minimal design minded friends Bettina and Max, (Miranda Richardson, Patrick Barker), are back to design Edina's kitchen in the 'white box' design of the title, and the scene is delightfully demented and offers a great slaptstick bit. Laurie Metcalf, as a psychic who attempts to reveal Edina's past lives is also very funny, guiding her back in time with the use of "funny voices". I even liked the goat scene and found it perfectly plausible that aging Patsy would believe that goats naturally speak.The episode is a fun little pit stop while the wheels of these ladies are still smoking. Here's hoping they never surrender. Cheers!

If you can imagine The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot; as performed by a Broadway musical cast, well then there's no surprises here. The Who's original &quot;Tommy&quot; album was a success due to it's innovative music but it's very thin storyline and simple themes of worldly gain and loss glare akwardly in this original Broadway cast recording. Peter Townsend's original work compared itself to traditional opera in that it's story was secondary, indeed only a backdrop to the music, but Broadway takies it oh so seriously with nary a drop of humility and restraint. It amounts to the sound of a loud parade passing by, in tune but colorless. For a better transition, see Ken Russell's 1975 film, &quot;Tommy&quot;.

Reruns of "Murder She Wrote" on cable TV were good for one thing - power naps after work. The episodes put me to sleep every time. I have yet to master the art of falling asleep while reading. The book is dull, routine, and dumb, just like the tv show, but not without that addictive pulp fiction downgraded IQ quality that keeps the pages turning. The resolution is a major let down, like a cold, burnt match concluding the final chapter. When my elderly grandmother died I inherited (took) her boxes of paperback mysteries, which certainly would have been tossed away by less inclined members of my family, mostly classics of the genre and the oddball title like this, based on the popular tv show. Assuming she had read this well-thumbed copy, I'm hoping gramma wasn't bored to, ahem, tears.

Australian metal band with a philosophical handle on star-struck hit making angst, battling the demons of rock and roll success via cool control over thumping bass line guitar, bewildered teen vocals, and just enough tender reverb to give the songs memorable hooks and riffs. Picture a young, crownless James Hetfield fronting a more melodic Cannibal Corpse and scowling at barracuda record executive types as in "NBT", or 'next big thing'. If this sounds a bit pompous, it comes across as a genuine love of metal in familiar thump and grind structures that often slip into quieter, more thoughtful angst, as in the nearly apologetic, metal defending, "Bad Funk Stripe", and the fluid, bar-gazing, "Repeat". The band's individual roles aren't credited on the CD, but the vocals, scowling and lung busting one moment, meek and vulnerable the next, give the band both a youthful zest and wizened maturity.

Three people aboard a fairly leisurely sailboat excursion on a Polish lake, sounds rather dull, but Roman Polanski's first feature length film is an absorbing intense drama in which even the mundane manual rigors of sailing becomes an exciting metaphor of human manipulation. The three characters, (the only three people seen in the entire movie, as a cost saving measure Polanski tells us in the DVD extra), are as perfectly formed and developed, understated and powerful, as we could expect from an Ingmar Bergman troupe of actors. Unlike most DVD extra director interviews, Polanski's inclusion of surprising facts about the film actually enhances the viewing of it. We learn of the difficulties involved with getting a film accepted by the then, (1962), socialist minded, communist controlled Polish film board, which explains some unusual dialogue concerning the difficulties of being a university student. The dialogue was added only after the censor board determined the film was of no social value. The actress, Jolanta Umecka, in an accomplished solid performance, was discovered at a municipal swimming pool, specifically for the casting of the film, and had no previous acting credentials. The actor, Zygmunt Malanowicz, had an inappropriate high pitched voice, so it was dubbed by Polanski's own speaking voice. The film itself is perfect satisfying drama. The DVD extras, including several Polanski student films, makes it shine all the more.

Brad Pitt is Jesse James and Casey Affleck, (Oscar nominated Best Supporting Actor), plays his assassin, Robert Ford, in this fine and moody, psychological western, based on Ron Hansen's book, which takes it's long amusingly clumsy title from an actual 1882 newspaper account of the murder of the famous outlaw. A long movie, at 160 minutes, it breathes, as opposed to moves, at an unhurried pace, like a slow steam train forever halting to a stop, as it rides a paranoid and lonely trail, treats character conversations with cinematic patience, reveals dusty 19th Century American towns and cities as if bringing life to vintage photographs, and riles things up with a frightful night-time train hold-up, shot in shadowy sequences, that features a splendid and nightmarish scene of outlaws in ragged masks awaiting the beaming white light of the approaching doomed train. Director Andrew Domink has a handle on the gun draw, (and American western history in general), with two dynamic scenes of characters, poised on adrenalin, shooting another through the head, as if deciding at the most oppurtune moment to swat a fly off the wall. And like that train halting at it's destination with a steely screech and last steam cloud blowing, the film winds down, most unusual for a western, with a denouement, that follows the assassin for a considerable time after the murder to his own western justified fate. A fine film, a great western, magnificent and humble cinimatography, ( Oscar nominated Roger Deakins ), and stellar acting from the leads and wealth of plentiful supporting players.

This is really an old fashion melodrama with mental ward cliches derived from Susan Kayson's autobiographical journal of her time spent in an institution in the late 1960s after a suicide attempt. Angelina Jolie's much acclaimed performance as a schizophrenic vixen is worthy of the Supporting Oscar she received but Winona Ryder is equally as good in the lead role of a young woman whose ambivalence causes her to close the door on the world around her. The film rolls along at a steady pace with familiar dramatic plot elevations and the mental ward girls are so frivolous and predictable it's as if the orphans from &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; have grown up and gone nuts. Vanessa Redgrave as The Psychiatrist with the power to grant freedom seems very much the same psychiatrist from the first Hollywood film to realistically deal with mental incarceration, &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, from 1948 starring Olivia de Havilland. Whoopie Goldberg is here as well playing a kindly mental health worker. Depending on your point of view this DVD is either fine melodrama or a Junior Miss 'Bell Jar'.

&quot;It was a robin's egg and it was blue&quot;. Nice simple line in the Superchunk single, &quot;Mower&quot;. Hear it melodically shouted over the catchy rhythmic guitars and after awhile you begin to get some idea of, as the song says, &quot;what they're saying&quot;, but don't ask me to explain it. OK, I will. I see it as a stoned out baby talk communicative of some profoundity. A second song, &quot;On The Mouth&quot; is a fast and furious ode to teen frustration like spending a night alone on a couch making kissy with a pillow. The live track of &quot;Fishing&quot; is down, dirty and druggy with lo-fi anxiety ridden guitars burying lyrics I can barely make out, but it sounds like, &quot;It's not your water, let's go fishing.&quot; Let me think about that awhile.

Guitar drags around pounding drum kit and trippy-dippy vocals that shout like an adolescent in teen-angst sexual transformation. This compilation of singles and B-sides is an entirety in itself with the loud rhythmic guitar creating a climaxing crescendo that rises and breaks in guitar heaven in the final two songs, "Forged It" and "Home At Dawn". Great stuff, and smart too! Superchunk's insights into teen wanderlust and adult misgiving speak to the teen in all of us and if Superchunk had their way they would crawl right back to babyhood and re-utter their very first syllables in the hope of charting a course to a less troubled but less tuneful adult.

I downloaded Guv'ner's &quot;Lucky Ladybug&quot; off this three song CD single, (we need new terminology for the music of the new millennium), and was awakened to what sounded like a warped indie version of an old Perry Como/Doris Day record with alternative music non-sensibilites. The kind of song Doctor Demento of radio show fame would have held dearly. After the song tipped my brain to permanent imbalance mode, I ordered a copy in the hope the other tunes, including the titled &quot;Break a Promise&quot; would return me to equillibrium. Unfortunately the other two songs aren't nearly as demented and now I'm stuck here like a juke box that forever skips.

For the longest time, it was the only Pink Floyd solo album, not including Syd Barrett's departure from the band and reality via LSD, and it is a subdued and rather comfortably numb offering from prog guitar riff king, David Gilmour, with leanings towards blues guitar and flashes of Floydian space rock. "There's No Way Out Of Here", got all the radio airplay in 1978, a holy ghostfest goth-like FM radio favorite with impending organ, harmonica, and a female chorus torn between church and a 'Dark Side Of The Moon' recording session. Otherwheres there's a bit of routine and generic guitar filler, but "So Far Away", recalls Gilmour's early 'Umma-Gumma' era Floyd work, with piano driven lingering melody, and just enough guitar and downbeats to make it cool and spacey, and "Short And Sweet" sounds lifted from a blend of post-Beatles projects, notably Harrison's "What Is Life?", and Starr's "It Don't Come Easy", poured into Gilmour's own question and answer session. It's a fine and nostalgic album, maybe exactly what you'd expect form Pink Floyd's super guitarist, given the chance to be alone.

A minor progressive rock classic from the 1970s, "Eldorodo", with it's romantic 'Wizard of Oz' cover and medieval full orchestrated sound has always been a favorite, although then, and now, still a bit vague in assessing the place, Eldorodo, as a state of mind. Who cares? I'm off to join the good fight where "men have fought the holiest wars", and "smashed some of the holiest jaws". Love the god-like voice that opens and closes the album, either welcoming or cursing you "high on a hill in Eldorodo!", and that South Sea Island guitar that soothes the weary warrior after the battle. Opener "Can't Get It Out Of My Head" remains a melodic mental fixtation, "Boy Blue" sounds like trying to remember the song 'Hang On Sloopy' after too many mugs of ale, fave "Laredo Tornado" is a whirling dementia of words and sound, "Poorboy" is the perfect Robin Hood fantasy. "Mister Kingdom" is still alluring yet distant and a bit vacant in describing a man alone in a cityscape, "Nobody's Child", finds our fantasy hero tempted by a prostitute, "Illusions in G Major" is rock and roll boogie filler, and the album closes majestically with the luscious title track. We apparently were very economical in the '70s and didn't let much go to waste, hence the bonus tracks, a kareoke like overview and an unfinished song structure, are scraps. Includes written commentary for each song by writer, composer, lead Jeff Lynne.

I didn't know who John Malkovich was before "Being John Malkovich", and since then he has unfortunately rubbed me the wrong way with his prissy characterizations and his cocky self portrait. He redeems himself as director of this engrossing suspense thriller about a law enforcer tracking down a group of mysterious terrorists in a South American republic. I liked the intrigue about the unknown killers being somewhere among the public and the subsequent search for them, but couldn't help but scoff a bit at the 'under your nose' resolution, and the South American detective's unexplained American-like cop buddy ( he behaved as if he just flew in from L.A..) But the film hooks you in the beginning with sustained suspense and doesn't let go, it looks great, and it carries a certain sense of social responsibility in our terror filled times.

I bought this book on the basis of a National Public Radio story which promoted it in an in-depth study of the devestating 1900 hurricane that killed thousands in Galveston, Texas. The radio spot spared no expense with the sound of hurricane force wind surrounding the historic taped voices of survivors describing a night where death pounded on the door. It made a much better radio show than it does a book. The problem is, the eyewitnes accounts are all in cloudy retrospect, some were taped seventy-plus years afterwords and are shaky historic accuracy. The book is a compilation of various communications from victims and survivors; personal letters, weather reports, diary entries, newspaper headlines and the mighty storm soon becomes as redundant as a 'Weather Channel' report. If the authors had found a grocery list of a victim, it would be included. Surely this hurricane which killed over 5000 people in an American coastal community in 1900 was more horrific than the drab, hearsay accounts given here. There is no journalistic quality. Even the photographs show page after page of what appears to be the same pile of wooden rubble.

Not the definitive Hollies collection, but a pretty good one. "Bus Stop" is missing, as is "On A Carousel", but it has twenty others from the original master tapes including, the unlikely hard-rocking "Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress", the echoey, organ saturated, "Long Dark Road", the novel. skirt chasing, wolf whistling pop of "Jennifer Eccles", and the harmonic Calypso-Mersey beat of "Carrie Anne", along with super hits, "The Air That I Breathe", and the solemn, and surprisingly still vital, "He Aint Heavy, He's My Brother". The crude stereo separation sounds warm and nostalgic, and the CD package includes commentary for each track by lead singer, Allan Clarke and original producer, Ron Richards.

Clumsy comedy-mystery concerning a dead journalist, who receives a news tip that is SO good, he leaves the afterlife to pursue it. Another trivial parlor game from Allen, that beholds a comedic and cinematic vacancy under it's brisk and snappy pace. Scarlett Johansson is all nerves and girlish charm as Allen's counterpart, and while the film is dependent on their co-presense, the sparks between them fall flat. Hugh Jackman, as an English aristocrat who may be a serial killer, serves well as the film's contrast to the silly proceedings, but stands alone like a partner without a dance. At the theatrical viewing of "Scoop" that I saw, several young teenagers, there apparently for Johansson's sake, laughed uproariously at every good and bad joke Allen cracked. If nothing else, maybe the film will have a younger generation searching Allen's backlog of true comedic masterpieces.

British punk band evolved into a shiny pop outfit before imploding in the early '90's.Their greatest hits package offers glistening pop sheen, ("Skin Deep", "No Mercy"), art-pop Euro-lounge, ("European Female"), punk with careful pop borders, ("Something Better Change"), some lame and toughened up covers, (The Kink's "All Day And All Of The Night", and ? and The Mysterians' "96 Tears"), and a dark, eight minute, guitar soloed, organ pounding version of Burt Bacharach's "Walk On By". It may be said The Stranglers, with so many musical styles, lacked an identity of their own, but there's no denying the 15 tracks on this disc offer an upbeat, addictive listening experience.

Chicago based &quot;The Arrivals&quot; feature gruff Joe Strummer-like vocals, Clash-like melodies, and their own unique Chicago thrashing metal garage sound heavily indebted to the best of 70s punk, particularly &quot;The Clash's&quot; first American release, the notoriously underappreciated &quot;Give 'Em Enough Rope&quot;. Some of the songs, &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Chineese New Year&quot; seem a bit like melodic radio airplay hopefullness but it is their more sinister sound as in &quot;Heavyweight&quot; and the thrilling, frightening, &quot;Surf Riot&quot; that &quot;The Arrivals&quot; shine like a dark emerald heralding punk as a thriving musical form. &quot;Surf Riot&quot; locks in the memory with it's impending doom-like premonition of a wild good time and &quot;The Barter&quot; speaks of &quot;being saved&quot; by a no alternative mainstream music machine with a driving beat, Gothic influenced vocals and a crash and boom decibal shattering bass guitar. Should &quot;The Arrivals&quot; arrive at your party, be prepared for a rockin' good time.

I was so riveted to the screen, you'd think much more was going on in "Shattered Glass" than the true story of the exposure of a "New Republic" magazine journalist as a fraud. It's how to make a good drama and build suspense without hanging over a cliff and detonating explosions. This is wonderful filmmaking which takes a relatively non-sensational news story and raises it to a profound and highly entertaining level. The DVD includes the original "60 Minutes" newsstory in which said reporter Phillip Glass attempts to make the viewer sympathetically understand his undoing. It is to wince.

Downright silly album from England's Hefner, based on the wreck of a love relatioinship that once frolicked in the cosmopolitan air of the big city. Quirky, like Robin Hitchcock, who singer Darren Haymen sounds a lot alike, the twelve tracks are crafty pop ditties, more often goofy than not, with expected and lazy hooks that long to entrance, but often dissolve like a TV show theme you've tired of. "Hymn for The Postal Service", from the album, "Breaking God's Heart", is what first attracted me to Hefner's music; an atonal, slow stirring haunt of letters never arrived, that sounds more genuinely broken-hearted than the in-your-face, giddy anger management attestments found here, although "Your Head To Your Toes", closes the album with the reminder of Haymen's stark singular vocals reeking lust without bells and whistles invading from all directions. No doubt, the relationship examined in "We Love The City", which at times seems a metaphor for English politics, left Haymen with a lunatic's grin, and a wagging tail impulse to tell his side of the story, but by the time he gleefully sings the chorus of "Ding-Dong The Witch Is Dead", backed by children's vocals in "The Day Margaret Thatcher Died", you just want to tell him to get back out in the city and meet some new people.

Like an obscure '60's Mexican lounge album, crossed with '70's style synthesizers, and towered over by a 21st Century mixboard, this dark and easy-going odyssey into the cosmos via an Ennio Morricone good, bad and ugly guitar, invokes a mental state of a south-of-the-border saloon, with a nourishment-giving insect at the bottom of your drinking glass, a bowl of organic fungi on the bar, and maybe a bare red lightbulb casting strange shadows around the room. It is in this bar that you have the most profound thought of your life, like, "I never noticed before that my teeth are upside down." Deeper the music goes into the cosmic jungle, the guitar leading you into a starry lit desert, you're transported away, and what started off in the first few revolutions as a modest, maybe even bland, space-psych instrumental, leisurely passing dull meteors, vacant planets, and the Mexican Clint Eastwood on horseback, becomes in a few more spins around the galaxy, the understanding of the song, and the revelation that the fungi tastes much better soaked in wine. And you are not of this world. And you're on a quest to find the magic sombrero.

German import CD will take you back to 1995, and the clubs where the music was so loud, you had to play Charades with the bartender just to order a drink, and where the strobe lights were so intense, it was like scaling a pyramid just crossing the room, while the techno beat pounded the dance floor and you accumulated free drink vouchers if you so much as appeared sober. Sounds like 2005. Thirty-nine abbreviated versions of classic 90's techno dance on 2 CDs is like one long extended dance track set to the same pulsating beat interrupted only by mainstream artist Ace of Base, whose "Don't Turn Around" never sounded more agreeable, with it's smooth velvetey techno-Abba drive, like a bit of patience among these more radical flights of dance.

I liked it but not nearly as much as composer Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine's other taped Broadway DVD's, "Sunday In The Park With George", and "Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street". Here, being characters from genuine fairy tales, the cast never emerges as anything but playthings in a morality tale, a slick and profound adult lesson to be sure, but with cut-out mature representation almost verging on the parody of "Avenue Q", that never wanders far from the simplistic fairly tales it draws from. Bernadette Peters' 'Witch' seems inspired by an "I Love Lucy" episode, and it is typical of the superficial characterizations the musical offers. Still, it delivers what you can expect from a Sondheim/Lapine project; a sweeping musical that ultimately offers produndity in the mundane. It's just not my particular cup of poison.

I feel like I've been strapped to a chair and forced to watch an entire season of TV's &quot;Touched By An Angel&quot;. What fluffy goody-good nonsense this film is. Bumbling eccentric angels have to be one of the thinnest fictional devices ever revealed in the movies and this group make Casper the Friendly Ghost look like a Dicken's spirit. I sat there waiting for this film to click into gear for quite some time until it became apparent this movie is a watershed of indifference concerning the afterlife in a small dying American town soon to be turned into a lake. As if the dumb angels weren't enough, we have worldly government agents in black trenchcoats and a Christ-like child looking for his wings which is much less compelling than Peter Pan looking for his shadow. Writer, director, and star, The Polish Brothers ought to row, row, row their boat in any other direction.

It seems there's this angel who comes to Earth and falls in love with a beautiful woman and becomes infatuated with human beings and life and this is not &quot;Death Takes A Holiday&quot; and if you like movies about angles who confront human nature as if it's an exotic butterfly then this is likely to be the cherry on your ambrosia pie.

Scowling lead vocals with a yelping trill, hung up on drugs or women, a big bad bass guitar, a prominent poppy organ, and a pounding beat sounds like British blues Animals and The Stones or if you prefer American, The White Stripes meet Paul Revere and The Raiders &quot;Kicks'. This five song EP is just enough to whet the appetite for more, as did their live performance which I remember being akin to a circus car of clowns spilling onto the musical stage.

A Criterion Collection DVD set with three of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's early-1960's films, which have come to be known as his, "Trilogy Of Faith", in that all three films question and philosophize the existence of God. Each features a striking sharp and brisk black and white photography conveying isolation in the midst of familiarity, and desperation in the course of change.1963's "The Silence", the strongest and most ambitious film here, has a notorious history of being the first general public theatrical film to feature graphic pornographic images. The buzz of frank adult sexual content on the big screen made it a box-office success in the United States, one of the few global movie markets to neither ban nor censor the film. Look for waves of an inspired Stanley Kubrick's work in "The Shining", in the story of two adult sisters and a child who interrupt a train ride to take residence in an old Gothic and spacious European hotel in a mid-urban city. Bergman experiences with a hand-held camera for the first time as the sisters reveal an impenetrable wall of distance from each other. One is sickly, the other looks for excitement and sexual companionship in a city that offers their own isolation back to them on a silver platter. The child meanwhile, exuberant with innocence, explores the mostly vacant hotel, amuses himself with a cap gun, and strikes up a friendship with a troupe of David Lynchian travelling acrobatic dwarves. Bergman severs the familial tie that bonds in a closing sequence aboard the train with two of the characters returning to lives we never learn much about, while the third remains, as if trapped in the dying hotel. As Bergman is, the film is dream-like yet mundane, with a morale concerning the distance we insist upon one another.Bergman himself is prone to inspiration and 1961's "Through A Glass Darkly", is reminiscent to, of all things, Tennessee William's "A Streetcar Named Desire", in it's depiction of a tragic and possibly mentally unbalanced heroine. Four family members converge to a seaside home for a holiday weekend and again, the familial bonds shred as one resorts to mentally unhinged behavior as the others seem to helplessly encourage her psychological breakdown. Suggestions of childhood rape, and incest, and unsettling victimized pathos like the character Blanche in "Streetcar", make this a grim profile of degradation amidst the support and misplaced love of family. Here Bergman leaves you helpless, pining for release from the mental trappings of a troubled past.1962's "Winter Light", is more stark and impersonal than the other films, creating a cold detached godless universe in the story of a priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand, who also stars in "Through A Glass Darkly"), losing faith and questioning the worth of his own life. Like cold water through frozen plumbing, the film trickles it's spotty information, long time frames, and deadening snowy images, as if it's slowly breathing pace will simply cease at any moment. It's Bergman at his most stoic.The DVD set includes a documentary on the making of "Winter Light". In Swedish with English subtitles.

Oh, I don't know. Is this really the best comment on race relations in America that we can expect from Hollywood? I'd be hard pressed to name the race of any co-worker, neighbor, or friend I know but, "Crash", for all it's kid glove liberal morale, lives in another world. A world of familiar racial stereotypes characterized as only pawns in high drama that more resembles network television, (picture a millionth episode of 'Hill Street Blues'), than it does powerful cinema. Black people are either hip-hop, jive talking carjackers or slaves to the system, white people are capitalistic, powerful and affluent, undisclosed low income Asians are robbery prone small grocery store owners, and Thai are helpless and abandoned slaves or refugees. The film succeeds in only it's whiplash sensation of melodrama; someone survives a sure hit with a gun, a character is pinned in a fiery crash, a man steeped with revenge leaves his home armed with a weapon. But as a race relations comment, the film is pedestrian, and as dramatic entertainment, it is unfocussed. Just what are we to make of the sexually molesting police officer coming to the aid of one of his victims? That he's really just a nice guy?

Picture Saddam Hussein in a psychiatric session with Dr. Phil. Such is the image of heavy metal monster, Metallica, hiring a prominent psychiatrist-of-sorts to remedy their internal conflicts during the making of the "St. Anger" album. This is really one long unintentionally funny group therapy session, with the macho Metallica reduced to bratty siblings tattling on each other to mommy. It's a wonder these guys ever make it through a day. The psychiatrist, who remains with the band through the years it took to make "St Anger", is about the most un-Metallica like square you could ever imagine, sporting a mall bought knit sweater, and hush-puppies no doubt, looking like somebody's Dad from a 1960s sitcom, mouthing broad bland strokes of psychiatric wisdom which is sometimes heard as nothing short of profound from the members of Metallica. Later in the film, when Metallica determines he is no longer needed and too expensive anyway, and the psychiatrist himself is apparently making plans to become an unofficial fourth member of Metallica, as maybe some former band members can attest, he is given the boot. Chewed up and spat out. And the poor guy doesn't get it. He has a mental block. He can't comprehend getting fired. I thought he was going to start begging - "I'll do anything -I'll sweep the floors - I'll carry the amps!" You can hear frontman James Hetfield murmer something under his breath to the effect of, "See you later, chump." It was a bit reassuring to see Metallica bully somebody around, and this documentary reveals Metallica in all their flawed human glory. They're just your typical multi-millionaires with problems just like the rest of us. When drummer Lars Ulrich decides to part with his art collection of famous paintings, he is conflicted. He loves the paintings but decides he wants to share them with others. A museum or gallery doesn't leap to mind, but a public auction does, and he is rewarded with millions and millions of dollars in profit. Boy, can I relate. It was just the other day I was looking at my original Van Gogh on the wall, thinking, you know, I'm getting so bored with that picture ... By the time the work is done and Metallica steps on stage to reveal "St. Anger" to the world, you have to believe that you have witnessed the process that resulted in the fine music. I like these guys even more than I did before seeing the film. It takes courage to reveal to the world that you're just a bunch of jerks. The striking tinted color cinematography during concert scenes looked like a neo-youth for Hitler rally nightmare. Seas of flesh saluting praise to Metallica. The editing and sound of the film is superb. It has to be the first rock and roll documentary I've seen, where, as far as I can recall, not one cigareette was lit.

Gershwin CD is strangely lacking in atmosphere and reference, with over an hour of Gershwin's more classical side, including Michael Tilson Thomas conducting The Columbia Jazz Band's "Rhapsody in Blue", featuring Gershwin's original 1925 piano roll, Leonard Bernstein conducting The New York Philharmonic's "An American in Paris", and composer John Williams on guitar in "A Foggy Day". With song titles like, "Medly From The Woody Allen Film 'Manhatten", at just over three minutes, and "Medly From 'Porgy and Bess'", the CD is a classy cash cow thrown together by CBS Records. Tilson Thomas' "Three Preludes for Piano", stops and takes a dramatic musical breath in the context of these slam-bang offerings. Truly bland CD liner notes by Bobby Finn and Kay Swift, whoever they may be.

There are lapses of direction in &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, places where the musical focal point seems to be going nowhere. Marriage can be like that, and this album seems to come from the deep cocoon security a good marriage can provide. I see Ms. Bush behind a castle wall living the mundane life of a happily-enough common wife and mother freely probing her past of childhood trauma. I'm assuming it's trauma that turns her cherub-like vocal in &quot;Rocket's Tail&quot; to a monstrous caregiver who shouts &quot;Eat this! Eat This!&quot; like a cuisine nightmare. Some of the album is so base yet it remains alluring even under the simplest of themes like the Internet musical greeting played throughout &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; and the marriage-go-round familiarity of &quot;Heads We're Dancing&quot;. &quot;This Woman's Work&quot; seems much more than the sexual dysfunction that comes to mind, more an affirmation to survival itself. This album is warm, secure and daring.

Like the glory days of AM radio, when you could hear the newest single from The Rolling Stones, followed immediately by the conventional "Theme from Romeo and Juliet", this 17th volume from Rhino's "Super Hits of the 70s, Have A Nice Day" series, offers a variety of styles that made AM Top 40 radio so splendid.Danny O'Keefe's "Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues", is a most welcome haunting ballad of longing and regret with touching lyrics spiked by a kindly passage of the era's drug culture, - "I got my pills to ease the pain." Cymarron's "Rings", is a one hit wonder that gives a good name to 'easy listening'; a lazy poetic slice of good loving with great sing-a-long lyrics - "I got James Taylor on the stereo". The other 10 tracks are oldies radio staples including Nazareth's "Love Hurts", Brownsville Staion's "Smoking In The Boy's Room", and Orlean's lilting ballad, "Dance With Me". Mike Post's "The Rockford Files" is superfluous and Morris Albert's "Feelings" is Gong Show worthy.

Part of the problem may be Gong Li's superficial performance as a young artisan in love with a poet. She flirts well with the camera but does little to reveal the complexities of her character, likewise her dual role as an older woman who serves as narrator of the film, is lacking in depth and conviction. Beautiful cinematography and thoughtful editing can't make up for the overall emptiness of the film.

Documentary attempts to lift the veil on mysterious, unknown musician, Jandek, who has been steadily producing and distributing his own beatnik meets acid freak music for decades. The only evidence of his identity is a P.O. Box scribed on his self-owned, crudely generic record label, Corwood Records. The film mirrors Jandek's successful self promotion, be it genius or simply sincere, by painting an eerie, enticing picture while infatuated talking heads, (record geeks, rock and roll writers, and a reserved, trustworthy, radio icon, Dr. Demento), speculate on his identity and music. The genuinely creepy, yet hollow and mundane images of Jandek and his environment, from his K-Mart Photo Booth-like album covers, along with the strange stream of unconsciousness music, (definitely an acquired taste, like drinking gasoline is an acquired taste), creates an undeniably frightening unknown. The payoff is a telephone interview in which Jandek reveals himself as a normal, yet private and protective guy, whose dumbfounded silence, when asked a simple question, (a very funny scene), is indicative to the limits of his playful madness. This documentary has pushed this admirable artist, who you become fond of as you watch the film, into the mainstream. Some of his albums are now sold here at Amazon, courtesy of Corwood Records, the Willy Wonka of record factories.

I wouldn't doubt that &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is a series of dreams experienced by Kate Bush, as there seems to be no other reason for this collection of bizarre unrelated Gothic-induced songs which are at times indecipherable, majestic, lovely, ponderous, familiar, and scary, very much like dreams. Bush's shrieks and wails in &quot;Pull Out the Pin&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;, sound too much like a real victim of violence, and &quot;There Goes A Tenner&quot; is a dream fairyland or birdwatching in heaven or running for public office in the afterlife, all to progressively friendly piano chops that skip merrily along. Do you know what is so intriguing about this artist? She's just a regular demented girl.

It tries to reach the heights of cinematic atmosphere, with deep and personal human questions, but effectively accomplishes only the localized dilemmas and comedic pain of a successful, and bored Chicago weatherman, on the verge of scoring a big network TV job. Domestic storm clouds hover over David Spritz, (Nicholas Cage), just as he is about to join Bryant Gumbel in New York for a cushy weather position; his overweight daughter is becomiong more distant, (honestly, it was refreshing to see a movie kid, who wasn't a Life Cereal role model), his ex-wife is completely uninvolved in his efforts to reconcile, his son is being seduced by a male teacher, and his famous writer father, (Michael Caine), is dying of cancer. And he's thinking of chucking the whole business aside, and writing dime novels, which apparently he isn't very good at. As he leans toward a higher income bracket, with New York beckoning like an emerald city, he attempts to gather his dependent flock through the stormy weather, all the while questiioning his pursuit of a job he perceives as insignificant and threatening to his life's calling.Like an inaccurate weather forecast, The Weather Man tries to cover too much atmosphere, the amusing domestic traumas don't always collide well with the meandering life philosophies. A one-nighter with a sex bomb seems an afterthought to there not being any sex in the movie, and the son's pedophilic teacher seems offhand and unnecessary melodrama. But it's still a great, fun movie you can't help but become involved in. The daughter's indifferent archery endeavor,(she chooses it as a hobby as if pulling a number out of a hat), is very funny, and the overflow of product endorsement, fast food chains, for instance, all get equal time product displacement, is a subtle and amusing comment forecasting a time when Burger King will be able to place it's logo on the face of the moon.

Steven Spielberg's sci fi mega movie from 2001, is a time traveling, bumpy carpet ride of exciting and profound entertainment, combining a boy's wondrous adventure, albeit an 'artificial' boy, with meticulous film construction of inspired images of the near and far future. From the sterile and precise modern suburban culture of the near future at the film's onset, to the carnival holocaust, spectator sport extermination of artificial beings in the film's most striking, and emotionally riveting scene, and the towering decadence of a destroyed New York City towards the film's end, and finally, to the very fringes of time itself, (as in Kubrick's "2001"), "A.I." paints an astounding canvas of a likely tomorrow.Its conclusion, however, so absolute that one expects an almighty god to enter the picture and wrap things up, seems elongated and not entirely focused, as if Spielberg had many endings to choose from, and decided on them all. Other problems weigh in. Our hero's infatuation for The Blue Fairy, from "Pinocchio", and the love of 'mother', are crossed swords, where one super maternal figure would suffice, and the boy's last wishful fantasy come true, a very human desire, seems much less than the milestone, (or light year), one expects him to cross. The beginning too, a platform discussion on the ethics of biological tampering, is a fistful contrivance. Still, it's the journey, not so much the destination. that makes "A.I." so appealing, and once the robotic Pinocchio, who only wishes to be a real boy, is set on his way, through the door of a couple who adopt an artificial boy, there is no stopping the film's childlike wonder, adventurous spirit, and mature thought provoking insight. I really felt the desperation of the 'artificials' being threatened with extermination in the carnival concentration camp, (The Flesh Fair). Speilberg's subtle characterizations of human want and need, particularly in the artificial junk rummage scene, with humanoids pilfering for needed body parts, makes these pathetic unfortunates soar with humane value. Haley Joel Osment, who always spooked me before, as an unfortunately gifted child actor, is masterful at creating a robotic, spiritualized protagonist with a heart of tin. The special effects are excellent, maybe the best I've ever seen, and the credits include Meryl Streep and Ben Kingsley in cameo roles.Some tweaks here and there aside, this is "The Wizard of Oz" of the modern era.

A magnificant little odyssey that will warm the heart with genuine sentiment and delight the senses with gorgeous New Zealand oceanic scenes. Thankfully, this 'feel-good-movie' accomplishes just that through a compelling simple story, wonderful performances, and a high regard for the indigenuous peoples of New Zealand. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as the young girl, even a tear-jerking speech in an emotion packed scene is delivered with great deft and restraint and she has a beautiful singing voice, bringing much clarity and exposure to indigenuous tribal songs. So real was the traumatic beached whales scene that I was scrambling through the end credits to insure no actual whales were harmed, and of course it was all a brilliant special effect. For fans of this film, the DVD offers a &quot;Making of Whale Rider&quot; documentary in which cast and crew deservedly talk about the wonder of this beautiful film.

Anyone who has appreciated the great records of '60s Motown has at one time or another given an earful of appreciation to the big brassy perfection of the studio back-up band. This documentary attempts to attribute the excellence of those wonderful records to the studio musicians known as "The Funk Brothers". However as accomplished as these musicians are, the great Motown records were truly the inspiration of the great record producers of the '60s who are sorely lacking in representation here. It needs be said these guys were merely session players for the Motown recording studio. Unsung heroes, no doubt, but not the guiding hands the movie alleges them to be. They would have never been left behind when Motown Records packed up their East Coast operation and moved West if they were the hitmakers the movie claims. Why for instance are the major artists of that era not here in this movie testifying and singing the praises of these musicians? Instead we're offered mostly lukewarm renditions of Motown classics by contemporary artists that seemed an excuse for a movie soundtrack recording, as the original hit records are heard here in only edited bits. Watching The Funk Brothers reminiscing and regretting came across as righteous sour grapes, however unfortunate the era was in reserving royalty checks for the record companies and not the musicians. They deserve their due and it is sad this film couldn't portray them as the strong backbone and not the curator of those wonderful records. As the movie ultimately and unwittingly reveals, The Funk Brothers were session players for Motwon Records. No more, and respectfully, no less.

A dying woman is surrounded by her sisters in a Swedish mansion at the turn of the 19th Century. I can't recall a movie death being as cruel as the one pictured here with the dying sister gasping and pleading into oblivion. Bergman's statement on the wasted measures of our lives is a glorified 'stop and smell the roses' morality tale, deeply depressing, meticulously filmed, and irresistibly haunting.

Traditional gangster film with a modern British spin. Drug kingpin advances to the top of the trafficking 'layer cake' of drug smuggling, and believes he will be able to retire in multi-millionaire comfort. There's just one more job to do. While all the familiar gangster themes are here; heads packed in ice, double crosses, pistol wielding maniacs, the film boasts a realism that reveals the upper income underworld with little pretension, and not a godfather in sight. The entire organization is nearly brought down by the hot potato 'big score', - one million hits of the club drug Ecstasy, a loot, I would assume, no self respecting murderous drug smuggler would be left holding in a bust. It all makes for an intriguing and entertaining gangster film; these characters could be the grandsons of 'Goodfellas'. It's no wonder the cool, controlled Daniel Craig, as the accomplished and independent anti-hero, has just signed to be the new James Bond.

I ate these words up. Joyce Carol Oate's mastery of language is at the height of it's power in "You Must Remember This". I had to stop and seep in some of her truly inspirational prose, told in such a purposeful, matter-of-fact style, just to remind myself what a gifted writer can accomplish. A sometimes grey-clouded and bountifully absorbing novel depicting the human sexual condition under the colorless factory-lined skies of her native Western New York. I can't recall another book bringing the characters to such full-fledged living form as Ms. Oates does here. From what magic does she compose the radiating brilliance, sensitivity and brutishness, innocence and shrewdness of the character Felix, an ex-boxer who spends his life gallantly seeking the happiness deprived of in childhood. It would seem only a Boxing expert could delve into the mind striking constant chords of revelation and truths and opening the reader's mind to the insights and points of view of boxing. Or the character of Enid, a troubled, too deeply sensitive high-schooler whose mysterious mind and advanced maturity may reflect Ms. Oate's own childhood genius. These pages turn as fast as a high charged suspense novel, it's low-key slowly climaxing appreciation of the human condition result in an intimate bond with the characters and human nature itself. I feared the last handful of pages, so concerned was I that something tragic would happen to these tender, fragile charaters. As a Wesstern New York native I was delighted to read the countless descriptions, some bold others suggestive of this part of New York State where factory-lined horizons, still-water lakes and gaseous colors in the sky can be beautiful. I must say I found the title and conclusion of the book a bit vague but I trust Ms. Oates discetion and understanding that I will be remembering this for quite some time.

One of several Broadway Archive Series DVDs that chronicles televised productions of plays, The First Breeze of Summer, is an exquisite account of a black southern woman's solemn and painful retreating of her past as her family gathers for a birthday celebration during a suffocating heat wave. Civil rights aside, this story concentrates on the emotional plight of womanhood and the wolf that prowls in the back shadows of Christian conviction. A family Gospel singing scene with grandmother and grandson experiencing spiritual revelation is quietly shattering. The cast is superb, with notably, Frances Foster as the proud and saintly grandmother, and Reyno as her adoring and questioning grandson. The play, written by Leslie Lee, ran on Broadway during the 1975 season.

No kidding. The whole cast sings a Broadway song as the entire ship goes under in this outrageous, incredibly dramatic and stirring Broadway show that succeeds in treating the sinking of the Titanic with respect, without plunging to the depths of creative and real despair. The best musical sections concern communication among the ship's officers; an officer reporting on the ocean's temperment - "No sir, it appears to be a flat calm" ("No Moon") is delivered in a lifeless monotone like a sigh of relief before the iceberg takes their breaths; the frenzied and violent arguing among the ship's commanders and builder as the ship sinks, ("The Blame"), soars in intensity to operatic-like levels of tragedy. The musical also conveys a sense of time and regard for the generation of the Titanic; their hopes, fears, and understanding of their modern world, notably in "Barrett's Song", which delivers a life long passion of a young telegraph operator to the fateful journey. There's a rousing and emotion packed musical theme near the beginning and the end; "Godspeed, Titanic", and "Finale", and a song, "Autumn", taken from a song sheet actually found among the surviving artifacts of the ship, which fits securely and adds a haunting touch of authenticity. In the epilogue finale, the "Autumn" theme plays again in a moving musical interlude paying tribute to the lives lost. One can excuse the few imperfect moments; "Doing The Latest Rag", is a dull and obvious rag dance craze, typical of the 1910s, and particularly uninspired, and "Lady's Maid" is a touching but superficial and cliched 'immigrants coming to America' routine. All in all, it's a remarkable achievement. The CD includes a 43 page booklet with lyrics, pictures, cast and Titanic statistics. "A Night To Remember" the classic 1955 book by Walter Lord, remains the best source of the Titanic story, but this Broadway musical is a Titanic of a different color; a heart-felt, joyfull and tragic plunge to the ocean floor.

Stark and simple resignation of love and commitment, the new Jonathan Richman album may never grow to adoring heights as his last album, &quot;I'm So Confused&quot; did after repeated listens. Where &quot;I'm So Confused&quot; dragged love so seriously to a cold stone grave and preserved it, &quot;Her Mystery Not of High Heels and Eye Shadow&quot; dances on that same grave with an abandoning sneer and indifferent glance with songs that are such simple impersonal sleights of hand, they're over just as soon as you ponder them. Tracks like the title song, &quot;Springtime in New York&quot;, &quot;Me and Her Got A Good Thing Going&quot;, and &quot;My Love For Her Ain't Sad&quot; speak not of the beginning of a relationship, nor the end, but one that is firmly there in a possessive stronghold, like a fondness for a pet. Richman's handsome crooning voice is wonderful, like common conversation sung, and his acoustic guitar plucks can invoke the most exotic of atmospheres, particularly a 1950s Latino nightclub on a warm Summer night. &quot;Vampiresa Mujer&quot; (Vampire Girl), sung in Spanish, as are three others, is dark, catchy and amusing, or so I suspect as I possess no espanol.

The letter 'E' is burned out on the neon lighted lettering of the aging, scheduled to close Hotel Baltimore and the assorted low income residents and workers are going through their daily routine while the wrecking ball looms nearby. This urban themed play about the network of support these city dwellers have built for one another is poignant and comically abrasive, very 70sish, and while all the themes don't quite mesh, it is a successful character ensemble of psychological survival at the lower end of the social scale. The basis for a short-lived ABC-TV sitcom from the 1970s.

Oh, so smug. Pretty much exactly what I was expecting but with a higher degree of tongue-in-cheek humor and some stylish violent atmospherics. Brainless homage to cheap violent Asian kung-fu films based on a comic book remains adolescent and entertaining throughout. Personally I'd like a date with the &quot;Hiyeee!&quot; girl with the spiked ball and chain.

It takes skilled craftsmanship to update and modernize the lyrics of traditional American folk songs without losing the song's integrity, and that is what &quot;The Handsome Family&quot; have done on &quot;In The Air&quot;, a collection of Americana folk songs with a New Milennium bent. Such is the history of folklore, each storyteller lending his own version of familiarality to the story based on tradition and belief, and these songs are as genuine and sincere as the most beloved renditions. &quot;The Sad Milkman&quot; takes the wanderlust of &quot;On Top of Old Smoky&quot; and gives it a decidedly perverse human desire for The Moon crossing a mountain top over a loved one's grave. Religious symbolism is replaced with a familiar object in &quot;When That Helicopter Comes&quot;, where avenging saints marching in, clouds of joy, and such themes are seen as an Industrial Age, life-saving helicopter fluttering in the air. The Gospel influenced &quot;Grandmother Waits For You&quot;, remains as mournful and hopeful as the saddest folk lament while leaving it's religious root of belief in an afterlife planted in the ground. These songs are so stirring, so familiar, I only wish the instruments were allowed to continue a little longer after the vocals end to keep that sweet melody in my ear. Maybe that's what keeps me returning to &quot;In The Air&quot;.

From the jacket of my hard bound copy of this book, it states, "... forces the reader to turn the pages quickly to satisfy his simple curiosity: What happens next? How does it end?". So true. This tense, violent suspense play had me doing exactly as predicted, but when I had finished, I felt as if I had been gawking at a horrendous car crash, and felt a bit guilty for my indulgence. Mark Medoff's 1973 Off-Broadway play about a violent armed assault in a New Mexican diner is indebted and infatuated with William Inge's play "Bus Stop", also concerning a diner, and the threatening violence which lurks unborn throughout Inge's play, erupts in a sensational, exploitative fury in Medoff's. The characters seem like twisted versions of Inge's characters, one even nearly shares the same name, but the inhabitants of Medoff's diner are never fully developed as real people before, during or after the violent surge. Still, there is much sympathy to be had for Medoff's strange anti-hero protagonist, Red, and the pace of the play is as swift as it would be witnessing a bank hold-up.

Something like a Battle of The Bands in another galaxy with the imprisoned singing prince from "Monty Python and The Holy Grail" dreamily singing into a reflective portal like a rock star canary in a cage. The bizarre idea and sci-fi atmospherics finally give way to heartfelt emotional depth, like Pinocchio come to life, as our guy in space, once pathetic, now just real sad, plucks some real human heartstrings craving for love and worship in songs like "In The Morning Of The Magicians", with it's sweet sad refrain; 'I was waiting for a moment, but the moment never came', and "Do You Realize?". Certainly "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots" is a nifty melodic spacescape with craft to spare, but there's surprisingly little identification and empathy for this wimpy Buck Rogers with a fantasy black belt karate girlfriend crooning to a house of space cadets in some galaxy far, far away. It's as if The Flaming Lips really met this guy and his story is only slightly worth documenting.

Intimate and loving theatrical version of the folksy and slightly radical Garrison Keillor radio program, A Prairie Home Companion, a weekly National Public Radio show, broadcast from the fictitious, rural prarie town of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, "where all the women are pretty, all the men strong, and all the children above average.". If you've never tuned in, picture a folk music version of a Grand Ole Opry broadcast with sharp mid-western humor and accomplished and modest folk music, without money and celebrities.It would seem you may need to be a fan of the program to appreciate director Robert Altman's probing and low-key treatment of Keillor's script, in which the story of the radio show's last broadcast is merely a backdrop to the gentle rhythms and interactions of it's participants. Kevin Kline brings Keillor's Bogart-like film noir detective, Guy Noir, to an enormous life-like comedic characterization, and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly, as a pair of guitar strumming ranch hands, with a hysterically funny musical repertoire, are such a warm embrace of dusty saddle busters, it's like a cloud of mid-western dirt trails blows in with them every time they enter a scene.It doesn't all work so gracefully, it's meandering and inconsequential narrative at times seems less significant, and less smugly aloof, than any episode of the radio series, giving it the cinematic right to take itself more seriously. Guy Noir's 'lady in the white trenchcoat' becomes a literal angel who arrives to guide someone to heaven. Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, as what is left of a once regionally renowned singing family, although a welcome sight, get somewhat lost in Altman's typical ad-lib and overlapping dialogue, the enormity of their celebrity status projection overwhelms the smallness of their roles.But anyone from Lake Wobegon would tell me to mind my manners and quit knit-picking. It's a real treat for fans of the radio show. And anyone else can surely appreciate a good dirty joke, delivered joyfully with a devil's grin by Harrelson and Reilly.

When I converted my LPs and tapes into compact discs years ago, there were only a few I didn't want to keep and &quot;Lionheart&quot; was one of them. I since have replaced it and time has been kind to this luscious crop of super-feminine musical meanderings that seem just a heartbeat away from Lawrence Welk. After all this time however, I still don't 'get' &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;.

Edward Herrmann and Sigourney Weaver play a young successful suburban couple who allow their daily consumption of cocktails to manipulate their lives. A Broadway Theatre Archive Series DVD, the drama never gets as drunkenly sordid as say, "The Days of Wine and Roses", or "Come Back, Little Sheeba", as the alcohol dependence here is subtle as it frays at the binds of family ties. Especially moving is the husband's ignorance of his young daughter's ( Mara Hobel in a fine juvenile performance), intolerance at the succession of household daycare workers who lose their jobs as it is discovered someone has been nipping at the sherry. The play, written by Wendy Wasserstein, is based on a short story by John Cheever.

Ten largely unknown punk bands, two songs a piece and a bonus uncredited version of &quot;Walk Like An Egyptian&quot; make up this compilation from 1998 by Hopeless Records. These tracks too often sound like they're coming from the same band of loud aggressive vocals and garage punk musicians but there are some distinct outstanding moments. Amsterdam's &quot;Funeral Oration's&quot; two contributions have some great hardcore pop hooks and sound like refreshed early &quot;Smiths&quot; singles minus Morrisey's efeminacy. &quot;Against All Authority&quot; adds a brass influence to its heavy guitars and drums creating an eerie punk marriage of ska and metal. Permanently etched on the back cover of the CD is the price quote in the tradition of indie/punk music. It's certainly worth it's cheap price.

It has the deliciously campy album version of "Mama Was A Rock and Roll Singer and Papa Used To Write All Her Songs", and the tacky pseudo-psyche "A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done", the lovely "All I Ever Need Is You", the stupid "When You Say Love" ( once the musical jingle for a Coca Cola ad campaign ), and Sonny on vocals in "You Better Sit Down Kids", a hit record where divorce is put to melody. The live tracks are comedic nightclub versions of their biggest hit records, ( "I Got You Babe", "The Beat Goes On" ), and a dumbed-down version of ( as if it could get any dumber ) "Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". I love the original if not classic hit records here but the live tracks are like a bad lounge act on a cheap cruise line. But if you like Sonny and Cher, then you like Sonny, and you'll like this.

Three discs chronicling the historic 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival includes the original film, the complete performances of Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding, and other performances not seen in the original movie. That movie (Disc 1), is small in scope, (the epic Woodstock performances would come a few years later), and crudely edited, with songs sometimes abruptly halted mid-performance, or cut away from before the audience reacts, and after viewing the third disc of the other sets, the original film does not encompass the essence of the event, while Disc 3 does, offering the late Laura Nyro, after a murky bit with her band and backup singers, in a stunning solo appearance, Jefferson Airplane in a dark and gothic heavy set, and of course, Janis Joplin with Big Brother's Holding Company, whose completely riveting and sexual performance should have been showcased alongside Hendrix and Redding within the context of this package, (there is a feature length film of Joplin's Monterey show), and The Who, described as an up and coming band from England, (they were already enormous in 1967 with those in the know), in a magnificant pyro-technic climaxing appearance. These along with many others on Disc 3 musically define the era and the festival, even Top 40 'producer's band' The Association, mocks their generic image pretending to be robotically controlled. It is, however, the complete Jimi Hendrix appearance, that rises Monterey a significant notch above a historic footnote. One can only marvel at the fluidity of his total being, and the sadness of his tragic short life. Many of the amazingly subdued audience, as if waiting to hear The Mamas and The Papas, did not know the cultural significance of the moment they were witnessing, some like they were frightened and about to run for the exits when The Eternal One ignited his guitar in flames.

At the dawn of the 80s, (or was it the death of the seventies?), I was taping a concert or something off the radio and reluctantly the tape recorded a live Kate Bush album that was played afterwords. I couldn't tell you the name of the concert I recorded, lost to memory, but that Kate Bush music at the end stayed with me until the cassette tape turned to thread. For the longest time it was the only evidence I had of Kate Bush. I couldn't find a record store that even knew her. The cassette played a concert recording of five songs from &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. I first kept returning to the tape to hear one or two things that I wanted to hear again before I found myself amazed and sedated by the changing musical arrangements and a dead on operatic shrilly singer who seems tethered on the brink of a big closing musical key and a goofy circus show. Kate Bush albums found their way into my life and they have been prized but &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot; refuses to join her sisters on my record shelf. I am nearly appalled by &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;. What kind of nonsense is that? This album does not invite me in to it's music, and I've given it considerable time to do so. Come on babe, get to work.

The same buzz. Woody Allen's new film debuts at Cannes. It is said to be a return to form. It has critic's drooling. It is Hitchcockian. Stop. It is being nominated for numerous awards. STOP!My first reaction - just about the worst title for a film about a tennis teacher. My second reaction, how can you take the strong backbone subplot of (Allen's) "Crimes and Misdemeanors", and use it as the singular thrust of a new film? You can't, Mr. Allen. That film left an incredible impression on me and you musn't tamper with it.Not unless you do it quite perfectly. You can hammer it home again. You can make me feel that I haven't returned from a movie theatre but from an art gallery, showcasing a stunning, but depressing new exhibit. After viewing "Match Point", I'm not strolling along with a renewal of life, wishing for a Manhatten weekend, chuckling to myself, no, I'm dragging a guilty heart for hoping, for even a moment, that the fortunate son-of-a-gun in this film gets away with his crime. I momentarily understood the mindset of an unwilling accomplice. When tragedy befell a character in Allen's "Bullets Over Broadway", the loss and exit of a hysterically funny performance was felt as if someone had really died. And in "Crimes and Misdemeanors" all I could think was, ...yes, yes, people are probably like that. Here, the bottom falls out competely. There's no brushing shoulders with those with little regard for human life. We are as insecure as the tennis ball wobbling atop the net, as alike as the trapped rat defending his space.The pretty lipped lead, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, is pretty impressive, and Scarlett Johansson, so vital, genuine, and sexual here, proves herself in all sorts of ways. Woody Allen has delivered us a cold slap in the face, and maybe we need to be reminded how badly people can suck. "Match Point" is a disturbing thud to the heart. I'm in the movieplex lobby, as the real world falls back into place, and the tinge of guilt I feel is complimented only slightly by the sudden rationale realization, that I don't think anything, could have me buy a ticket, and enjoy, a gay Harlequin romance about cowboys.

I had to pause the DVD and pour myself a glass of wine, just to keep in step with these two middle-aged buddies celebrating the demise of bachelorhood on a wine bar vacation in California's wine growing region. Several glasses later, like a back seat rider through philosophical discussions on impending deep middle age, sordid quickie affairs, earnest heartache, hateful fights and renewed friendship alliances, I took my last sip and realized these wine connoisseurs would balk if they knew the cheap wine I had been drinking all evening, and I longed for the mystique and sensation of the fine wine that is the source and nutrient of this film. I thought, "maybe I'll start a wine collection and really get to know wine.", as this film inspires one to do. ... It is the next morning. I have a terrible headache.

Fine rendition of the classic H.G. Wells story with Tom Cruise in a surprisingly effective and sensitive performance as a divorced man running with his estranged children from invading aliens. The down to earth family dynamics contrasts well with Well's sometimes cold and calculated documentation of the near annihilation of Earth. When the father and son squabble over deeply rooted family issues, (son takes pop to task for being a semi-absent father), it is as dramatic and urgent as the monsters dropping from the sky in the backdrop.The film retains the novel's remarkable, future gazing, menacing and mechanical 1898 depictions of aliens from outer space, while never appearing hokey, and looks like a glorified nightmare of doom in the sky in Steven Spielberg's extravagant 21st Century special effects, giving the film both a sci-fi nostalgia and a modern movie appearance.It ends a bit suddenly with an, "and then they were gone" resolution, but it's an intense adventure on the way to victory, helped enormously by the talents of Cruise and Justin Chatwin and Dakota Fanning as his children. Spielberg displays his magician's handle on doom mongering disaster and freedom.

Not bad. Not good either. Take a song, any song, say, Mott the Hoople's "The Golden Age of Rock and Roll", from Hoople's last studio album, and screech a distorted guitar over it and you have title track, "I Hate Rock 'N' Roll", or take later day Beach Boys single, "Do It Again", and screech same distorted guitar and you have second track, "Snakedriver". What we have here is pure pop, buried under a droning tuneless guitar that makes the same alarming sound my last car did before it died, (it was a Hyundai). Fair enough, it's a rarities and B-sides collection, (meaning the album didn't work), but Odds and Sods it ain't. It ain't even YESterdays. Some of it is very catchy, and maybe I should be thankful the killer guitar crucifies nearly every song or you may find yourself playing Name That Tune in the deep recesses of your garage rock mind, (not always a good thing if you remember "Indiana Wants Me", and The Archies). But I love the short, punkish, "I'm In With The Out Crowd", and the gentle and really lovely, "Little Stars", sounds like every debut bar band remaining afloat by an excellent bass player, or so you told your drunken friend, who felt they just sucked. But I hate, "Teenage Lust - Desdemoana Mix", Desde-MOAN-a, get it? It's really not very funny. And all of this is not very good. But it's not bad either.

Until the big shoot-out climax, when the plausible factor gets stretched to the limit, 3:10 To Yuma, is a big enjoyable western relying on the traditions of the genre without resorting to post modern hindsight. The film is based on a 1957 highly regarded film and a story by Elmore Leonard.A partly crippled rancher, (Christian Bale), volunteers to help escort notorious outlaw, (Russell Crowe), to the 3:10 train to Yuma, to collect two hundred dollars he needs to keep his ranch alive, feed his family, and thwart greedy land developers. The stockpile of western cliche's, (nearly all of them; the stampede, the cowardly sheriff, the stagecoach heist, the hotshot young gunner,...) seem only fine dramatic development to the mounting suspense due to the traditional and convincing performances of the hero-villain team. The escorts are chased by the outlaw's shoot-'em-up gang, attacked by Apache Indians, besieged by railroad developers, followed by the rancher's daring young son, and finally surrounded by an American frontier that would rather see quick cash in their pocket than justice brought forth.The big climax in Yuma gets a bit crowded with unlikely character development and impossible action shoot-outs, and the finale could have kept the trails more blazing had it been slightly altered, but here's a western that so respects the heroic traditions of the genre, it's impossible not to love.

Five song EP from Austrailian metal rock band, Grinspoon, offers a heavy metal sludge sampling, with everyman teen vocals that unexpetedly burst into raving mad adult monster, and guitar chords that could excavate a stone quarry. Grinspoon lays it nice and neat with no pretense; just good rockin' songs spewing hard knockin' angst, with just enough 'F' words to remind us this is a private teen club.

First time director Juan Antonio Bayona reveals a reverence for classic horror films in this haunted house thriller about a ghostly country orphanage unleashing secrets from the past. Some of the finest films of the suspense-horror genre; The Haunting (1963), The Innocents (1961), are given the tip of the hat, and even the opening credits pay homage to the rapid succession of images in Hitchcock's classic, Vertigo.A successful married couple (Belen Rueda, Fernando Cayo), with an HIV positive adopted son buy the dilapidated and abandoned orphanage where the wife lived as a child. Their intention to turn it into a home for other disadvantaged children runs afoul when the young son experiences the presence of long dead children.What The Orphanage does so well, is master the classic jump-in-your-seat scare. Not the all-out, sudden horrific image of a grotesque, face ravaged killer with a bloody knife suddenly appearing on screen, but the subtle and equally compelling frights of a hand reaching out from the darkeness and a door slamming shut. The Orphanage earns it's shudders while absorbing you into it's somewhat traditional gothic story.It's a bit unfortunate that the story eventually overwhelms the tone of the film, and the last half-hour or so, becomes a fearless damsel-in-distress climax which is not entirely satisfying.The cast is fine with notably child actor Roger Princep as the son in a masterful blend of innocence and mayhem, and Geraldine Chapman, as part of a psychic investigating team, in a perfectly executed segment confronting technology with the supernatural. My highest marks though go to the creepy and quiet soundtrack, which had me second-guessing just which sounds were coming from the TV speakers, and which were the sounds of my own home at night.In Spanish with English sub-titles.

Cool music score, great cast, big productionm budget, but the detective story, while laid out clearly and treated seriously is abandoned somewhere along the way. For all it's wildness it could have also proved to be compelling. Very ironic to see INXS'S Michael Hutchence's fictitious koalo bear hanging from it's neck, as Hutchence himself died from strangulation in real life long after this movie premiered.

Ah, &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot;, maybe the coolest psyche-rock hit single to emerge from the '60s, with the perfect mesmerizing lyrics that mesnt God-knows-what although any discerning listener could picture the image of matchstick men, the swarming, disturbed vocals that eerily blended from left to right speakers, a wah-wah peddle, and a blistering wake up call to the heart lead guitar that alerted you to your favorite song on the radio. I wonder what ever happened to, um, ... what was their name? Status Quo? Was that their name? Apparently, after 'Matchstick Men', this English band continued to produce hit after hit in their native land, and continues to be a working popular band there today, but nary another light show under the eyelids in America, although the title song, &quot;Ice In The Sun&quot; sure rings a distant decades buried bell and included here must be the original recording of &quot;Green Tambourine&quot;, made famous in America by, um, ... I can't remember their name. So where does Status Quo go after the majestic psychedelia of 'Matchstick Men'? All sorts of places; rockabilly, classic Southern rock, Delta blues, Bee Gees balladry, jangly pop, and every now and then, a whisp of their paychedelic roots. Some of these unknown songs get better and better with each listen, but I begin to think it may be better to burn out than fade away. As the album closes and it is apparent Status Quo is seething into what amounts to a very good Allman Brothers-like cover band, I get the suspicion their mellow, 70s rock, another round of beers attitude couldn't even listen to &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; today, let alone play it.

I'll make no friends critisizing HEART OF GOLD as a dull concert movie. I liked the modern Nashville insight centered around the historic Ryman Auditorium, where Young and friends gather for a concert to premiere the album, PRARIE WIND, but the strength of this film is dependent on the success of Prarie Wind as an album, given it is played in it's entirety, and the music falls short of being outstanding, a sort of lesser, "Harvest", with routine Young acoustic melody, sentimental, less than profound lyrics, and war protest songs lacking inspiration and artistry. I'm glad Young is alive and well but Praire Wind is less a wind than a gust of crudely simple ideas and songcraft.

I was quite disappointed. Director George Clooney aims for a historically accurate portrait of the 1950's and CBS-TV News' confrontation of Senator Joe McCarthy's anti-communist Senate hearings, and the characters here are as dull as stone face mugs ripped from an old history book. Historic accuracy is never as exciting as the real imagined thing, and these characters are cemented to their historical perspective. One, upon entering his first scene, might as well be wearing a sign reading, 'I WILL SOON BE A TRAGIC CHARACTER'. Clooney has polished his accuracy to a black and white dull shine that reflects his own fascination with the film's detail. The inclusion of a couple in the newsroom who harbor a secret, and are given considerable screen time, adds nothing but dramatic dishwater to the story. Frank Langella offers a fine stony portrait of legendary CBS executive William Paley, and David Strathairn as Edward J. Murrows has a closing speech on the future of television that is stirring. But if you so much as have seen a History Channel documentary on the McCarthy hearings, this film is a bore.

The famed Fiora jewels are missing from a museum and everyone thinks former jewel thief turned antiques dealer John Mannering has them. Everyone but Mannering himself, who dons his former celebrated jewel thief persona, as 'The Baron', to discover who has the loot. This fast paced mystery is the 44th in the 'Baron' mystery series, and has an air of sophistication and exciting passages of chase sequences and police investigations, as it dabbles in the world of London trend and art forgery. Characters are sharply defined, Mannering and his wife, Lorna, are a breezy cool couple, and there is intrigue in Mannering's little incognito equipped antiques shop. Easy reading and maybe just a tad run-of-the-mill.

Alt-country atmospherics that sound like the musical forces between two lines of lonely but active telephone wires along a deserted Texas highway. Jay Farrar's (Uncle Tupelo) rich rambling voice sounds both virgin and whiskey-throated and when he sings &quot;catching an all night station, somewhere in Louisiana, sounds like 1963, but for now it sounds like heaven.&quot;, the listener is right there with him cruising down a starry twilight highway onto the next time zone. &quot;Trace&quot; reminds me of The Eagles first record without the big city polish with equal parts acoustic country soul and flat out Southern rockers, neither form vying for prominence but blending effortlessly into a solid alt-music perfection.

Perfect audio adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy, originally released in 1963 by The Shakepeare Recording Society, with a cast of renowned British stage actors including Paul Scofield, (Hamlet), and Diana Wynyard, (Gertrude), members of a Shakespearean troupe, who in 1955 brought the play to Moscow for the first time since 1917. The recording is aglow with expert audio depth - old English musical interludes, complex vocal readings, and subtle and dramatic sound effects. You certainly won't find a better reading of "Hamlet" anywhere. Accompanying book offers Shakespearean history and complete text of the play.

This staged production of the 1927 George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber hit play, about a theatrical clan towering over Broadway from their Manhatten penthouse, is still a comedic gem, with knock-out performances from Rosemary Harris, as Broadway's leading lady who regards every doorway as a grand entrance, Ellis Rabb, who also co-directed, as her John Barrymore-ish brother, a tempermental actor who remains just this side of frantic measures, and Keene Curtis, a leading man past his prime, grasping at roles with shoe polish adorning his graying hair. The biting 1920's theatrical sarcasm is still very funny, and serves as historical document of what was relevant at a time when emerging radio, silent movies, and sensational staged productions were Broadways's only competition. The foreign collection of exotic people and animals accompanying brother Tony, (Rabb), on his return trip from Europe, gives the production an authentic 1920's global glitz. I would have preferred to see this play filmed before a live audience, which would have comforted the sometimes hollowness of a filmed staged play, but "The Royal Family", is a real treat for lovers of theatre, and historical Broadway.

OK version of the William Inge Broadway play casts thirtysomething William Holden in the twentysomething role of Hal, a drifter who blows into a sleepy Kansas town on a Labor Day Holiday weekend. How does the movie shake up the sameness of the one set play? It goes on a picnic, literally showing what the play only eluded to, with an entire town celebrating an Americana holiday weekend, with much sly eavesdropping on the American conciousness. Picture Steven Spielberg's work with New England townies in &quot;Jaws&quot;, and Director Joshua Logan accomplisshes much of the same with Mid-Westerners in a down home country state of being. I also liked the visual sky and corn stalks references of the farming industry governing, like a sleeping watchdog, over the rural community. The best thing about it though, and the best performance comes from the featured screen debut of Cliff Robertson who brings much spirit and sensitivity to the role of the lead character's best buddy.

Very slow-going with long stretches of mundane actions like sawing wood, interspersed with subtle plot developments that reward and hook the involved viewer to the tension mounting story. Mostly a character study, expertly done, with a concluding morale of forgiveness that is significant and sympathetic, but seems less than the film's dramatic strengths.

The 'road', as an open highway to emotional oppurtunity, is a glistening blue and gray effect in Vincent Gallo's notoriously criticized, "The Brown Bunny", the portrait of an eccentric lone wolf who packs up his motorcycle in the back of his van and travels from New Hampshire to California. As a road picture, it seduces the viewer to kick back and comfortably watch the winding highways and impending horizon, despite the genuine nutcase driving the van. Singer-songwriter, Gordon Lightfoot's "Beautiful", becomes a crackling, cheery and upbeat ode to love, through the bug splattered windshield, in one perfectly pristine scene. I could have driven for hours, but by the time he reaches California, and the infamous oral sex scene, with a nearly comical (and egotistical) stunt-male organ, things get a bit, um, tasteless. Our hero's delusions turn out to be not very complex, and the significance of a flashback detailing his history, amounts to a character study the equivalent of a criminal and psychotic mind on network TV. As for the symbolism of the brown bunny, (there actually is a brown rabbit in the film), I fear it goes no further than a geometric shape children might see in the commode.

Entertaining reading as it is exciting theatre, these plays, all produced pre-1965, serve up some thrilling suspense and often, comedic nervousness in 10 masterpieces of the theatrical mystery/suspense genre. The biggest surprise is the cleverness, wit and well-hung terror in what should be a theatrical chestnut from 1935, "Night Must Fall". The older the plays of this genre get, the stuffier they sometimes are, but Brit playright Emlyn Williams ( Director and star of the first American production in 1936) has given us here a contemporary, even edgy suspense thriller with a great comedic flair, and what introduces us to what is probably the first modern day theatrical psycho in the character of 'Dan". What makes this play work is the lack of guess work in who the murderer must be, by the time the deadly deed comes, you have dismissed the obvious and settled your nerves on a host of others only to be deceived by a great playright's 'in your face' resolution. Even though the author has updated his play since it's premiere in 1935, it's still bewildering to hear a sarcastic house servant mutter a classic cliche when she tells an investigating inspector to "put that in your pipe and smoke it!". In William Archibald's "The Innocents", based on Henry James' classic novella, "The Turn of The Screw", a children's governess is obsessed to belief that her two young charges are possessed by ghosts and the sexual tension and imbalanced psychology of James' origninal work come full breathed to the stage. Agatha Christie's classic "Ten Little Indians" is the perfect prototype murder mystery with a group of people being knocked off one by one as they are stuck in a house on an island. The rather visciousness of Christie's original work is softened here, we end up with a surviving hero and heroine, and again, an unexpected modern day wit prevails. Joseph Hayes' theatrical version of his novel, "The Desperate Hours" finds a typical 1950s American family held hostage in their home by a group of killers, it's a straight-foreword, suspensful and melodramatic play, likewise Edward Chodorov's "Kind Lady", finds a middle-aged woman in her home also held hostage. They're all great plays, sometimes a little too deep in the stuffy cushions of old English parlors, but pour some tea, light the fire, and settle in for some supreme superficial entertainment. If you're fortunate enough to find the hardcover version of this 1973 compilation, it comes with glossy black and whites of the original stage productions.

A sort of 'Clockwork Orange' rock and roll documentary about Roky Erickson, lead singer of renowned late '60's garage band, 13th Floor Elevators, (who have gained deserving greater fame today than they did in their brief history), and his plunge into druggie mental illness and subsequent controlled sanity. It's another dysfunctional family documentary, like Terry Zwigoff's docu on underground comics writer, Robert "Crumb", where family members are revealed as social oddballs whose own sad turn of events rival the main pathos. Erickson was a heavy drug user, singled out by drug enforcement and finally busted on a marijuana charge and confined to a crude Texas mental institution for the criminally insane for three years, where, of course, he started a band, which included, for instance, a child killer on drums. Upon release he is a total social misfit, addicting The Cartoon Network as his new drug of choice. The film is not complete without the DVD extras which add a needed conclusion, (otherwise the skepticism is, once a heroin addict ...), but you'll have to decide if genius is lost between the pre-saved Erickson, reciting a harrowingly dark poem about family life in a drug induced stupor, and the post-saved rock 'n roller, likely to be found in a Starbucks signing autographs, and who the freaks are; the lunatic jumping the barbed wires of prison to go get high, or his symphonic tuba playing straight laced brother in a 'mommy loves me' session with his therapist.

Southern Fried Lamb alternative country that is more a nod to the soulful rhythm and blues records which dominated popular music in the late 60s and 70s. &quot;Grumpus&quot; is a skyline humming melody with lyrics passively idling another non-monumental day. Kurt Wagner's falsetto vocals get a bit wiry but it makes him sound genuinely involved in the Burt Bacharach, &quot;Love Unlimitted Orchestra&quot; dance floor sound. They're from Nashville where everything that isn't rock or country is alternative country. Whatever, this sounds like breaking up with your girl at the 11th Grade Gym dance all over again. I must say the name, NIXON does nothing for me.

Well, it had to happen eventually. A Robert Altman film I truly dislike. I get the impression this ballet company film was way scaled down from a bloated romantic script and consequently we're left with the bare bones of cliched situations and characters, who instead of executing their expectant behavior, manage to do nothing at all. I'm glad that the kid ballet guy with no place to sleep didn't end up hanging from a rope, and that the young star's choice of a common Romeo type over a dashing prancer didn't cause her starry-eyed Mother to rebel, but why ignite these flames at all just to see them die down to a warm but lifeless ember? The love story aspect was particularly insulting, just short of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw catching snowflakes with their tongues. Be it a ballet company stage or a common office, this film only proves that most of us have a pretty dull day.

Short, (50 minutes), one-act play concerning a long suffering waiter, (Sam Jaffe), and his five year relationship with a belittling complaining customer, (Ned Glass). When the waiter reveals a secret, the tables are turned on these 'enemies', creating just enough ripple of drama to make this an amusing piece that lingers in a cloud of deception. The DVD is part of the Broadway Theatre Archive Series.

In the American southwest desert, a family lives independently off the land in a modestly built structure, while the home schooled only child, a daughter, suffers growing pains as she longs for a more urban life, insisting to her parents, "Do you know what the word desert means? It means wasteland!" But there's a bountiful of family love, sun baked desert vistas, mystical coyotes, quiet star lit nights, and an artist's interpretation of the sky and land that make this sunny environment a thriving human oasis in the desert. Touching, leisurely, funny, beautiful to look at, "Off The Map" is a lovingly realised family film for high minded folk. The autobiographical sense bends just a bit as the plot documents the successful career of an artist who lives with the family. His career and work is shown so intricately, one might assume he is a real true-life artist, ( the movie credits suggests he isn't ), and the father, also an artist, who suffers depression throughout the film ( but never succumbs to gloom ), never reveals the source of his depression, and his artwork is strangely never seen. But that's small complaint for the warm embrace this film offers it's viewers. Pass the sun block.

Sometimes bizarre rendition of Shakespeare's comedy with a very young Laurence Olivier. The forest scenes are the best with very wild animals tramping across the camera eye as if they just escaped from a zoo. The film is old, creaky and sometimes inaudible but that is part of it's charm. Elizabeth Bergner's closing bit in the epilogue is very lovely.

Eloquent nature writing with a sense of humor, sure to delight any reader of down home country living. Author Doug Elliot's chapters on the natural world are lovingly researched anecdotes on the critters, plants, folklore, and people that compose North America's natural environment. An ex-hippie, Elliot is adept at speaking naturally with a scientific appreciation of the mystery and wonder of nature, whether he's hiking for an elusive mystical Ginseng root, or revealing a prized recipe for Dried Apple Stack Cake. Stories of native American folklore, particularly stories of Coyote The Creator, a hapless though efficient god-like being are delightful fables retold here in amusing moral ending style. Mr. Elliot has also illustrated his companionable book with splendid artwork revealing an artist's eye for the love and fascination of the natural world.

From the stirring majesty of it's main musical theme, (Je-sus Christ, Su-per-star), to the pop perfect song craft of it's light heart, (King Herod's Song, Everything's Alright), and the deep drama of it's darkest moments, (Damned For All Time/Blood Money, Trial Before Pilate), JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR remains a pop music masterpiece. Andrew Lloyd Webber, (composer), and Tim Rice, (lyricist), successfully, and respectfully turn religion into a modernist cultural celebration by fusing rock music elements, traditional opera, and a host of other musical styles, (Dixieland, Black Gospel, Folk), into the story of Christ, surmounting to a genuinely dramatic and involving opera, with vocal performances so realized, it is as if the listener is seeing as well as hearing. The guitar work here is simply amazing; the reverberating drone of the opening chords, angry accompaniment to full orchestra, solo bits and pieces bridging sequences and moods powerfully; this cutting electric gee-tar fits in quite snugly with traditional orchestra. Horns blast, blare, go funk, and celestial, and piano leads you through some of the most catchy pop ditties of the 20th Century. Strings swell into emotional climax, and vocal chorus shifts from adoring masses of angelic sentiment to vengeful voices of damnation and threats,(crucify him!). It's a powerhouse piece of music. Mind you, this is a secular story of Christ, quite scriptual, minus the Resurrection, with witty lyrics and tragic human pathos, (Jesus' weakness and doubt, Judas' suicide), that gives as much reverence to the historic man as it does the spiritual. I've never seen the staged show, but it would have trouble competing with the musical theatre of my imagination that this recording offers. Interesting to note; the Pope of the years Jesus Christ Superstar was first released, periodically played the entire opera on the official Vatican radio network. I guess he had good taste in music.

What have I gotten myself into? I'm watching valiant but impossible acting, undoubtedly by some amateurs, in a movie about modern tribal people in the Arctic Circle that is ... videotaped? Where's the Cinerama? This is slow-going. I'm checking the screen to insure I pressed the 'PLAY MOVIE' icon. Seems like an added feature. This is indeed, the movie. My eyes are getting bugged out by staring at the Arctic Circle on videotape. This is, I suppose what I would expect from people living in The Arctic Circle. A lot of sitting around in igloos. Hunting fresh meat. Cleaning fresh kill. You can't very well take people like this and expect them to act. A story begins to emerge, as if being told in a nightime story session igloo sit-around. I'm staring into the fire listening and watching the penetraing light and relieving shadows. It's a love story. Guy wants girl but girl's father not so sure. Ouch! Did that guy just kick that sled dog? Where's the injured animal disclaimer? That dog yelped in pain. This is ... too real. Another dog snarls and bites. Will somebody please wipe the snot off that baby's nose? Some of these performances start becoming sharply defined. I'm rooting for the hero and hissing at the villain. Let me review. I'm watching genuine Arctic tribal people acting in front of a camera in their own environment, outreaching the boundries of moviedom by claiming the story told and handed down through ages is the human possession of the heart, and the only reality. The sad, shocking revelation in the closing credits make it all too, too real. I'm all over the internet trying to find information about this wonderful movie.

A woman is told her nine year old son, who reportedly died in a plane crash, actually never existed. Is her missing son part of a diabolical plot or is she merely delusional? Unfortunately, it's the former, and the 'diabolique' comes in the form of modern movie super-villains, (think X-Files). A schizophrenic would have been far more interesting, but it moves along swiftly, like a glossy moralistic episode of 'The Twilight Zone', and never tries to be anything more than a big budget 'B' movie for bean brains.

A night cleaning woman (Ruth White in a deadpan and delightful performance), develops a relationship with a dolphin in an animal experimentation building in this amusing and slightly bizarre New York Television Theatre entry in the Broadway Theatre Archive Series by Paul Zindel. Originally broadcast in 1969, the teleplay offers some quirky '60's socio-psyche humor regarding the contrast between the animals, doomed for painful scientific study, and the simple, lower class, and seemingly lonely New York cleaning woman; On her first night on the job, her cloying and dutiful supervisor, (an over-the-top and funny Elizabeth Wilson), asks what she thought of the job interview in the Personal Office. It went something like this - She responds, "Some of the questions made me uncomfortable". - "REALLY? WHAT QUESTIONS?" - "They asked me if when I'm watching television, do I sometimes feel when the audience laughs, they are laughing at me?". - "WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?" - "I told them I don't have a television".This is a fun and low-key theatrical outing featuring a dolphin prop puppet that wouldn't feel out of place on Sesame Street, circa 1969. Music is performed and improvised by The Modern Jazz Quartet, including a repeating, taped vocal monotone version of "Let Me Call You Sweetheart", in an effort to make the dolphin talk. Oh, did I mention the dolphin talks? There is a scene where Helen the cleaning woman is attempting to understand what the dolphin is saying, and given this sweet unpretenious comedy, it is really an eloquent and touching scene.

Strange story, part of the Broadway Theater Archive Series, that brings an other-worldly atmosphere to the sterile and coldish setting of a waiting room in a city hospital, where five women have assembled to retrieve their children from a lengthy experimental procedure. The two-act play, written by Marsha Sheiness, and first produced by The Cincinnatti Playhouse In The Park in 1975, is a low-key drama with mounting tension and striking development, made almost surreal by what seems a monster lurking behind a closet door. Act Two delivers a quietly powerful punch, as if dazed and relieved by hallucinatory delirium after a slam to the head. A most rewarding and unusual play in an excellent production by the PBS 'Theater In America' series. The bizarre title is in reference to a children's rhyme.

While the Nazis are occupying France, a famous French movie actress is more concerned with scandal than the overthrow of her country while she tries to get rid of the corpse of the blackmailing man she just murdered.. She symbolizes France's reluctance to defend itself against the onslaught of invasion in this irreverent, off the wall comedy which delightfully treats the invasion of Nazis as a mere inconvenience. Part farce, part romantic comedy, part thriller, it even has a Hitchcockian nod to the all-purpose secret agenda, say, the microfilm in the old spy movies, in the form of "heavy water", which may or may not be an essential ingredient to making an atomic bomb.

The most remarkable thing about STAGE DOOR, is the absence of any true leading man. Adolphe Menjou is there, where a dashing romantic male lead may have stood, as a sleezebag Broadway producer, who courts the young starlets, and then drops them off like yesterday's luggage. His quality of character is nearly null, comedic effect really, and in effect, this boosts the young ladies, boarders of a NYC rooming house for young, undiscovered actresses, to center stage as strong, free women, who need not a Fred Astaire to come dashing into the room to sweep them off their feet. Seems almost revolutionary for a 1937 flick. Based on the Edna Ferber and George Kaufmann play, which only ran for 169 performances on Broadway during the 1936 season, the film is a bolder vision with equal parts melodramatic sentiment, and smart, snappy, and risque dialogue, that must have had the 1937 censor board on the edges of their seats. Ginger Rogers is a doll, equal parts sexbomb and smart cookie, and Katherine Hepburn is, well, Katherine Hepburn, immortalized by "the calla lillies in bloom again".

Pippin is the court jester of Broadway musicals. The story of a 9th Century son of a Roman king who seeks to find the meaning in his life is as casual as a troupe of travelling medieval entertainers, yet as entertaining as it's Broadway rock contemporaries; Jesus Christ Superstar, Hair, and even Rent. Great early '70's rock music with a heap of soul, (The Jackson 5 had a hit with Corner Of The Sky in 1972), and outstanding musical comedy performances by Tony winner Ben Vereen as the godlike omnipresent lead player, Chita Rivera as Pippin's scheming sex-brained mother, and Benjamin Rayson as the warring king. The late Bob Fosse coneived this musical based on a college project by composer/lyricist Stephen Schwartz.

Exquisite choral music highlighting 10 of the most familiar music from Handel's "Messiah". As a crash course to Handel's lengthy masterpiece, it truly highlights the essence of it's religious and secular nature. Vocals are full-bodied and lush, and the orchestra is subdued and powerful.

Energetic musical stage play chronicling the life of circus showman, P.T. Barnum, (Michael Crawford, who is quite adept at circus performance.) The big-top atmosphere is magnificant but the musical is bogged down heavily by an insistent plotline detailing Barnum's marital domestic trifle which adds little drama and only a bit of spice. It would seem Barnum's questionable and god-like exploitation of circus freaks lies at the heart of this superficial, action packed production, which is highlighted by genuine stunts and acrobatics. Filmed before a live audience in London, the extravagant cast call is well worth waiting for.

This is the world of mobile homes, bad marriages and aging barflies. M. Gira's (Jarboe, Swans) solo project puts an electronic noise factor in Tom Waits-like ballads that collectively ask whether to pop open another beer or go meet the maker. It may be easy enough for Gira to plop a talk track on top of the opening, &quot;You See Through Me&quot;, but the conversation from a young redneck couple about money and mothers-in-law becomes candid and frightening, like your eavesdropping on your best friends. The closing track, &quot;Blind&quot;, is a lingering, soulful, folk delight of self-awareness and pride. The rest of it may sound like somebody kicking empty beer cans around, but snap open a new one and listen. Gira has something to say.

An unpretentious true 'diary' from 70's British glam rocker ( for want of a better description ), Ian Hunter of "Mott The Hoople" during his band's successful 1972 tour of the States. He reveals a historically fascinating 'behind the scenes' look at the rock and roll concert circuit of the early '70s, where in Hunter's humble view, sex, drugs, and rock and roll take a back seat to wry observations on American life, a compassion for music, and a compulsion for old guitars found in American junk shops. The reader goes along for the ride as Hunter and the rest of 'Mott The Hoople' tramp across America like kids in an amusement park. Personal revelations and run-ins with a host of rock and roll celebritys give this book an insider's edge and there is a rewarding final entry which finds Hunter questionably inside the high security gates of Elvis Presly's mansion, creeping about like the obsessed fan he reveals himself to be.

For a recorded 'live' CD, this album is as intimate and personal as something spooky hollering in the middle of the night from your dark bedroom closet. Gloomy progressive gothic rock, too blunt to be metal classified and too dramatic to be punk, it creates a musical nightmare, the kind of dream you wake up from and ponder into the void over it's complexity, made all the more unsettling by an audience applauding and sometimes chatting indifferently over the superb performance. I discovered 'Swans' music after swearing allegiance to M. Gira's solo work ( &quot;Drainland&quot;; his current band is &quot;Angels Of Light&quot; ), and inititally found this to be industrially exotic, like a bootlegged former Soviet Republic's banned rock and roll. It has since found a niche in the corner of my mind reserved for great music. If this is symbolic of a 'swan', it has a bloody knife under it's big white wing. OK, the title of this CD is a little dark, but while the current state of 'indie' and other music is leaning dangerously close to what could be described as musical romantic fiction, let me slip into my headphones and shout out in a satanic tongue, &quot;Down with organized religion! Release the animal instinct in all of us!&quot;, and then it's right back to my life, my job, Radiohead, and the real world.
