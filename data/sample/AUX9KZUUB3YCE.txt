A great racing game.Background:I initially saw this game offered as a demo, which I downloaded; I was quickly addicted and ordered the game from England before Xmas 2004.The Game Basics:Playable as a single player or on-line (I was unable to play on-line as I was the only one with the game). Your view of the action is from either 1st person( in the driver's seat)(recommended) or 3rd person (from above and behind your car)There are 2 skills to play, 1.) Normal and 2.) Professional (where the physics of cornering, braking, spinning out and the effects of car damage are more accurate).There are 3 levels of racing; 1.) Bronze (9 races), silver (12 races) and gold (15 races). You must finish a race in the top 3 positions in order to open up new race courses to you. Similarily, you must complete all bronze before silver becomes available, and all silver to advance to gold. Money earned for good finishes allows you to upgrade you vehicle and also buy new and better cars.There are 5 different types of race tracts; 1.)Asphalt 2.) Gravel pit 3.) country dirt road 4.) town and country and 5.) Winter (with icy roads and frozen lakes). All these tracts require different driving techniques and skills.The Game Play:This game is simply an adrenalin rush from beginning to end. It is a contact sport with cars. Strategies requires you to drive clean when your in front but to bump and grind it out when your trying to come from behind (and what great fun this is).In the single player version you are pitted against 7 other opponents who are hell bent on winning at all costs.As good as any A.I. racing competitor as I have ever played against! The physics of this game are simply hard to believe; sliding around corners, turning, braking and collisions are as real as you can ask for in a racing sim. Also the scenery is stunning; especially the winter tracts.Extras:In addition to the main game there is a series of target practice games with a "rag doll" driver that explodes through the windshield after collisions. Also there are 3 short demolition tracts to try. These are fun to try but not as adrenalin pumping as the actual game itself.Suggestions:1.) You really need a steering wheel with gas and brake features to be competitive on the silver and gold levels.2.) There is a downloadable patch that allows you to turn off the "rag doll" effect that sends the driver through the windshield with every collision. This is a neat effect at first but becomes tiresome and time consuming during an actual race.Conclusion:It took me 6-7 weeks of solid play to win all 36 races on the professional level. At times it was very frustrating (especially on the gold level), but I was NEVER bored with this game.If you love racing sims, this one should not be missed. Highly recommend!Addendum Jan 08Having had time to compare 'Flatout' vs "Flatout 2', I have to state that the original 'Flatout' is a much superior game. They seemed to cut some corners in producing 'Flatout 2'; fewer 'rural' areas, more downtown city scenarios, no winter driving, etc. The original 'Flatout' was, and still is, the best racing sim I've ever been privileged to play.

Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451* over 50 years ago; it's theme of the 'Big Brother' autocratic society, has often had it compared to Orwell's 1984.Before I read this book I knew absolutely nothing of the story or its draconian motif. So finding out the altered definition of 'fireman' that this book refers to was a revelation, to say the least.The story: *SPOILER*This is the tale of Guy Montag, a 'fireman' within this repressed society; a society in which 'happiness' is permitted and even encouraged, but free thinking is frowned upon in the strongest terms. And what is the most obvious example of free thinking...why books of course. Thus we discover that Montag is a 'fireman' and his job is to burn books; burn books, so that no one in the future will every get a sense of history or get any ideas about changing the present regieme into a free thinking society. Montag's problem is that he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right; thus his personal revolt begins, and not surprisingly he finds friends and enemies in unexpected places.I liked the style in which Bradbury developed Montag; Everyone in this society is suppose to be happy, but Montag is increasingly unhappy. He is constantly talking to himself, always doubting himself and his new, 'radical' thoughts. It's not difficult to feel empathy towards Montag as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his position and he begins to question his thinking and his own sanity. His wife (and her friends), his job and his desire to read books all contribute in ways to reduce his ability to handle his increasingly difficult situation.Subjectively, I liked the first 2/3s of the book better than the latter; not knowing anything about this tale added to the intrigue and mystery at the beginning, making it hard to put the book down. I didn't find the latter 1/3 quite as 'believable' and that compelling sense of urgency that defined the first part seemed to disappear, and for this I took off 1/2 Star.Conclusion:A great book, much different than I'd expected. Well written, with a wonderfully developed hero; giving us many glimpses of a distressed and complex personality who is in an ongoing battle with his own inner demons, and a waffling conscience that's unsure of it's moral obligations as it fights to maintain his sanity.Interesting to see that some of Bradbury's thoughts of the future are not all that far off in certain parts of the world today; some maybe closer to home that we'd like to believe.* 451 deg. Fahrenheit, is the temperature at which paper begins to scorch and crumple.

'Of Mice and Men' was written in 1937 by John Steinbeck. To me, one of his finest works.The setting is in the Gabilan mountain area of western California and although no specific dates are mentioned, probably around the time of the great depression. The two main protagonists are George and Lennie, two drifters that travel the area looking for seasonal work at harvest time. George is a small cunning man while Lennie is giant of a man, but with the mind of a child. Their wandering lifestyle is fueled by their dreaming about better days ahead and having their own place...as Lennie puts it, "Can you imagine such a place, living off the fat of the lan'?". However their future is about to drastically change in ways they can never suspect (or understand) and the dream is about to be shattered forever.Subjectively, I loved it all; the finest of writing, that not only features exquisite descriptive passages of barns, horses and of lazy, late summertime afternoons, but also the unique characters that go into making this depression era tale. And although the book is really just a longer, short story (just over 100 pages in length) it is the ever-so subtle increasing tension coupled with the real personalities, that makes this wonderful novel so hard to put down.If any complaint, it would be that the tale is so short; it's all over almost as soon as it's begun. However, it's quality over quantity. Easily, 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

This is a collection of sudoku puzzles compiled by Will Shortz, editor of the N.Y. Times Crossword Puzzles.There are 250 regular Sudoku puzzles that fall into 4 categories; Light and Easy, Moderate, Demanding, and Beware very challenging. By and large the classifications are reasonable accurate. Nearly all 'easy' puzzles are do-able without notations or an eraser; the other 3 types will need some due consideration, requiring the solver to apply some of the standard Sudoku techniques that advanced solvers know and use, especially with the more difficult puzzles.In addition, there are 10 super sudoku puzzles which are played on a 12x12 grid (instead of the normal 9x9 grid). But wait, there's more (sounds like a fast sell TV ad, doesn't it) also included are a 5 other games called END VIEW, SNAKY TILES, UP & DOWN, ALTERNATE CORNERS and SPIRAL GALAXIES. These are all number, letter or maze type games that some may find very interesting and challenging, but have little to do with Sudoku.Conclusion:This puzzles are nicely sized for making notations and corrections but the book itself is not too big to take on a trip or such if you want to pass some time. It includes a reasonably assortment of easy to very hard sudoku puzzles. There are a few other solitary game/puzzles included as well. A good mixture for any Sudoku enthusiast. 5 STARSR.Nicholson

A fantasy/adventure novel of high intrigue and daring exploits.This novel is well written and well paced, making it a book that was hard to put down. The 4 main characters have endearing personalities and an inner warmth that makes them bond easily with the readers. I found myself thinking of them on occasion, long after I'd finished this tale; I guess that's one of those unique qualities that makes a book like this so special.A funny, fantasy adventure of the highest caliber. Told with a tongue-in-cheek style, this book easily captures the imagination of both young and old. 5 Stars!

Another great story from Steven Erikson.This is a short novella (121 pages long), but don't let the size fool you. It contains the same quality of story telling that fantasy readers have come to know and relish with this author's " Malazan Book of the Fallen" series. (in fact the story itself takes place in the Malazan sphere of influence)I really like Erikson's descriptive narrative abilities; he has such a natural way of making the words on the page transport you to another place and make you feel a part of the surroundings. In this instance, it's a sombre mood with a chilling atmosphere in a town called "Lamentable Moll" (don't you just love the name). A place as seedy as they come, where there has been murder, multiple murders in fact, and the local gendarme has been charged to find out what is going on. And what he finds out is...well, lets say, unexpected.All in all, a wonderful read; if you like the "Malazan" series you'll love this. Highly recommended!

An interesting read from Margaret Atwood.This is definitely a story noire, set in the not too distant future in a dictatorial, 'Orwellian' society . Life is a struggle and one does whatever one has to do, just to get by. And whatever one has to do just to get by, is usually controlled by the state.I like Margaret Atwood's style of story telling; she takes a decidedly different plot and surrounds it with interesting characters and circumstances. As with most of her books, there are a few twists and turns along the way to keep you on your toes.Conclusion:Not a particularly happy story, but intriguing enough to keep the pages turning, IF, you don't mind a somewhat Draconian tale right out of "1984". If you can deal with the subject matter at hand and if you like Atwood's style, you'll enjoy (or at least appreciate) 'The Handmaid's Tale'.Ray Nicholson

Previously, I've liked most efforts by this author, but this one was an exception.My concerns?...let me explain1.) I found that the rather unusual combination of heroes, that being, Borel (Prince and all round good guy), Flic (a faery) and Buzzer (a bumble bee), really pushed the envelop of believability to the very edge (I know, unbelievability is difficult to conceive as a concern when discussing the fantasy genre).2.) Although this novel did have a few good moments, I felt that the dialogue between the main characters had an overall sense of immaturity; this hindered character development and made it difficult to become immersed in this book.3.) I got the feeling that a lot of the background story telling done in this novel was really, (and let me be honest here), just fill; maybe to enlarge the book to novel length?...I began to find it easy to begin skimming some of these sections.4.) Many of the "quests" in this story seemed somehow, out of place; they just didn't seem to fit in. It seemed a new piece of the puzzle would spontaneously appear in a chapter and then become the next important piece in a series of problems that need to be solved. The concern being, that more often than not,(after a period of head scratching by our heroes and several dead ends) a convenient, timely solution appears, like magic, to let the story finally proceed onwards.All in all, less than I'd hoped for! 2 Stars.

This is a RTS that is fun to play and is guaranteed to get your adrenalin pumping once you get into the action. It has 3 different difficulty settings, (easy, normal and hard) and it is playable as a single person or as a multiplayer; this review is of the single player game.The game setting is the European/Eastern Asia theater during World War 2; however the game throws in a few "what if" scenarios and a few futuristic weapons to make the game a little different that your normal WW2 game.As with any game there are positives and negatives...let me explainThe Pros:1.)Non linear game play; although you must complete certain objectives to complete a mission, how and in what order you do it is completely up to you. You can also play the game from either the American or German point of view (with completely different scenarios). This gives the game a large degree of replayability2.)Your three main "heroes" of this game have upgradeable skills, giving them special talents to help you in certain situations. Some of these skill are passive (in effect all the time) and some are active (only begin when you click on an icon and only last a specific period of time)3.)Some buildings, and airports have upgrades available once specific conditions have be achieved.4.)Easy save game at any point. (recommended to do it often)5.)Grouping of infantry and vehicles to allow you to facilitate deployment of your troops.6.)Production buildings and airports can be set up to continually produce the same group of units that you've instructed; this allows you to continue to make tanks, infantry and airplanes while you "try" to concentrate on running the war effort.(not as easy as you'd think)7.)Some "hot keys" are available to facilitate commands to certain units.8.)You have some limited amount of time to set up your forces when the mission starts, then it is intense, nonstop action from there to the end of a mission.9.)Use of the "pause" button to stop all the action; however, you can still look anywhere on the map to assess what needs your most urgent attention.The Cons:1.)Initially, you can easily feel overwhelmed and become frustrated with this game; trying to complete mission objectives while being continually attacked on several different fronts at the same time. The action at times is so hectic it borders on chaotic; it's just hard to know which major problem to try to fix first.2.)The instructional manual, although complete, is very basic and simplistic to say the least, when compared to the scope of activity you are going to have to deal with in the missions.3.)The tutorial covers only very basic strategies, or so it would seem, (see "suggestions" below) in its instruction, and hardly prepares you for what's to come. Learning how to use the tutorial to its full potential will help immensely.4.)I could not get the game to install initially; after an hour of fiddling, I eventually went to the web site to the FAQ (frequently asked questions) section only to discover that the game may not install with an active firewall; once I'd disabled my firewall, it installed without any problem. I just can't understand why a potential problem such as this would not be mentioned in the instruction booklet.Suggestions:1.The tutorial is deeper and more useful than it initially appears. On the section on fighting, you should take your time to learn how to use your buildings to produce infantry and vehicles that have the same group number (for example you might have a combination of 20 infantry and tanks in group No.1 and a group of 6 fighter planes and bombers in group 2, etc.) This will allow you to send an entire group (instead of individual units) off to battle with one or two mouse clicks.2.In the tutorial on turrets and airfields, there is another group of enemies that are not in obvious view on the map; if you look for them with a plane you'll find them, then you'll have a real battle to practice on the tutorial session. Of all the help available on learning how to play this game, this was the most useful.3."loop" you building units to continually produce infantry, airplanes and tanks. You will not have time to do this once the action starts.4.)use the "pause" button to get time to think (when all is chaos around you). Although you can't make any changes during "pause" you can use the time to determine what needs to be done first once you "unpause" the game.A great game, with a huge and somewhat difficult learning curve; however once you've mastered the basic game controls it's a real blast. 5 Stars.R.

"The Picture of Dorian Gray" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain.

A well done World War II FPS featuring the USA Airborne division.As with any game there are positives and negatives...let me elaborate.The Pros:1.)Excellent graphics, audio and gameplay.2.)Several upgrades to weapons (larger ammo clips, scopes, faster reload, etc.) that become available with progress in the game.3.)The game requires thinking, patience and working with your comrades. No stand up and blast away here; you just won't last very long.4.)Multiplayer available if you register your game online.(See Cons: 2.) below)5.)Many different weapons to choose from; each with their own different characteristics.6.)A really satisfying sniper role; one of my favorite modes.7.)Non-linear game play; although you must complete specific goals to progress, you can complete your objectives in any order and your movement is unrestricted.The Cons:1.)You'll need a high end system* to run this game properly.2.)If you want to play online (multiplayer), you must register your game with 'Electronic Arts' (and there is only one registration allowed per game). So this may restrict the resaleability of the game somewhat.3.)Saves are done (automatically), but only at specific checkpoints (controlled by the game). So if you got killed just before reaching a checkpoint you have to start the entire segment again. (and you must engage all the same enemy you just fought, again)4.)If you want to switch difficulty from lets say 'casual' (easy) mode to 'normal' you loss all your game saves and must start all over (which includes a tedious tutorial)5.)There are only 6 different battles segments (in 6 different geographic locales) on the entire DVD (plus a short training tutorial); and although some of the segments featured extended firefights, the entire game was somewhat short to play.6.)Limited replay value.Finally...this is my favorite type of game (that being FPS with some weapon upgrades) and despite its overall short length, I really liked this game . The fighting was visceral and gut-wrenching; you really felt a part of the action going on around you. 4 1/2 Stars.* Review based on the following specs: OS was 'Vista' with a Dual Core processor, 2 GBs of RAM and a 8800 series nVidia video card.R.

An enjoyable book.As with the first book in the Corean Chronicles, this novel is about our reluctant, humble hero, Alucius: a good guy, whose easy to like, making the book pleasant to read. There is, however, enough action to keep the story interesting and moving along.(with the exception of one, somewhat repetitious part, about 4/5 the way through).If you liked the first book, "Legacies", then you will like this one as well. It's not deep, but it is entertaining and will keep you coming back to it until it's finished.

A magnificent book!An extremely well written testament of man's inhumanity to man; small glimpses of emotions, revelations, insight and even rationalization that occur within the human mind during moments of extreme stress and depravity; "moments" in this case, occurring almost continually for over a year.The quality of prose reminds me of Anne Franck's diary; it's another book that makes you sometimes just stop and think of what can occur all too easily when we live in a setting that has no moral code to guide it. And yet, there are a few that are able to survive and become a greater persons for all this deprivation.A story of pain, despair and survival. Highly recommended!

This is my favorite book of the Dark Tower series.I've never been a huge fan of horror (Stephen King's or anyone's else) but the fantasy aspect of this particular series has really caught my attention. And in truth this is much more fantasy than your typical Stephen King horror.In their ongoing quest to reach the Black Tower, Roland and his Ka-tet (Eddie, Jake, Susannah and Oy) come to a farm village called Calla Bryn Sturgis where some disturbing occurrences have been happening of late. Strange wolves started raiding the area about the same time children began to disappear, only to reappear, but drastically changed. Does it have something to do with the arrival of the 'wolves'? What is going on with the children? Is Andy the Robot all that he appears? And what is going on with Susannah? Reasonable questions that are all answered by books end.I found that this 5th installment had a high level of suspense. I could not wait to get to the end of this book as I knew it would be climaxing with a terrific battle; a battle that I felt (IMHO) was one of the best actions of the entire series.Other reviewers mentioned that there were some areas of this novel that dragged a bit, e.g. the return trip to New York. However, I felt that not only did this side 'trip' add information regarding the entire series, but also allowed me more time to anticipate and appreciate the final sections of this thrilling 5th installment.Conclusion:Stephen King at his best; high fantasy that is intriguing, page turning and extremely well done.Ray Nicholson

A good adventure/fantasy read from Jacqueline Carey.I've decided to do a review of all three "Kushiel" books,(that being "Kushiel's Dart', "Kushiel's Chosen" and "Kushiel's Avatar") as one review; all three books are connected with the same ongoing story line, quality of prose and a consistent level of interest and intrigue.This is a story of Phedre, a heroine who is blessed (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with some special talents and skills; she rises from obscure beginnings to queens' favorite over the course of the three novels.The books were well written and gripped one's interest from early on. There is travel, love, betrayals, unexpected enemies and friends, and a few situations where magical qualities are displayed; but my favorite scenes were those of the battles and escapes. You should also be aware that there are some very intense, sexually explicit encounters in these books.All in all, I enjoyed this trilogy very much; while not deep or philosophical it was easy to read and found myself looking forward to finding time to return to these books when the opportunity arose. The only negative, (and this is purely a subjective, personal opinion) was that I found the areas involving travel within the book a little long and dragged out; but this is a minor complaint compared to the overall quality of the entire trilogy. 4 1/2 stars.

Some thoughts...The Pros:As with most fantasy there were elements of magic, deceit, betrayals, unexpected friendships and a smattering of romance; and in this book, there were a few areas that were witty and humorous. The story proceeded with a good pace. There was very little 'down time' in this story; something was always happening or about.The Cons:1.) A story that had characters were so shallow and one dimensional that the book was difficult to finish.2.) Profanity!...profanity that was excessive and unnecessary (were talking about the 'f ' word here). Profanity that occurred in situations that, generally speaking, it was very unlikely to happen. e.g. When Locke was speaking to the members of the upper crust of the Camorr society; and even more unbelievable was that fact that these members of Camorr's nobility never said a thing about our hero's continuous vulgarisms.Let me add this; I have no problems with swearing in novels when it is done in the 'proper' situation, (there are times where swearing adds realism to the situation (depending on who is speaking and what is going on at the moment). However, this novel exceeded even my level of 'reasonable' swearing tolerance. I find it hard to believe that one of the editors didn't get this problem discussed and corrected. (then again, maybe they did, but the suggestions went unheeded.)1 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A wonderful DVD! I think both Orff and Beethoven would have been pleased with Ozawa's interpretation of these works.This DVD presents Seiji Ozawa conducting both Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana" in 1989 in Berlin (with the Berliner Philarmoniker and the Shin-Yu Chorus of Japan) and also Beethoven's 9th Symphony in 2001? in Tokyo (with the Saito Kinen Orchestra and the Tokyo Opera Singers). In addition, the Orff work has guess soloist Kathleen Battle, Frank Lepardo (tenor), and Thomas Allen (baritone). The soloist for the Beethoven work are Anne Schwanewilms,(soprano), Barbara Dever (alto), Paul Groves (tenor) and Franz Hawlata (bass).A fabulous performance of Orff's work. Ozawa's animated conducting style is able to get the best out of this orchestra and chorus. Allen's baritone voice is well suited for this work; while Kathleen Battle gives a smooth, emotional performance. Her voice is just so pure, her singing almost effortless, that she simply stands apart in this cast of great singers. (While watching this performance I began to wonder how much time must have been spent in rehearsals in preparing this huge Japanese chorus to sing in Italian. Whatever difficulties (if any), Ozawa pulls off this Herculean task with considerable aplomb).The 9th Symphony by Beethoven is every bit as good as the Orff. With the difference of 11-12 years between these two recordings Ozawa has become decidedly grayer, and with a look of seasoned mastery about him. However, with age, his conducting skills seem even better. He controls his orchestra/chorus with a raise of a finger here, a look of an eye or a nod of a head there; but he's always in charge and with impeccable timing.The camera work and editing was first rate in both performances; moving and switching to the next instrument/singer(s) was done with accuracy and great effect. There is a wonderful balance in this video with respect to the amount of time showing the orchestra/chorus verses Ozawa. (I think back to some of the Von Karajan "legacy" DVD's and how much time seemed to be taken up showing the conductor rather that the orchestra). The audio is also top notch.Highlight of the disc:So many to choose from, but I'd have to pick Kathleen Battle's rendition of "Dulcissime" from "Carmina Burana" (cut 24 on the disc): 49 seconds of the purest voice and sweetest sounds you'll probably ever hear in your lifetime. (As an aside, notice the violin player just off Battle's right elbow during this aria; I think he was entranced with this performance)All in all, two great pieces of music that are performed as well as I could ever has hoped for. But make no mistake about it, this DVD is as much about Ozawa as it is the music being played; a legacy, if you will, profiling his talents and skills as a conductor that have accumulated over a long career. Highly recommended.

An interesting read! (mostly)This in not your everyday fantasy adventure. In fact, those of you expecting something akin to George Martin's "Ice and Fire" series or Steven Erikson's "Malazan Book of the Fallen" novels will probably be disappointed. This is a fictional story dealing with the reemergence of magic (after centuries of absence) in England of the early 1800s. The first part of this novel is ponderously slow in its development, but if you persevere you will be rewarded with a thrilling tale and an excellent ending.Well written, great character development, an intriguing plot and a superb ending make this book a definite winner. However Clarke's greatest writing asset is her use of descriptive prose: i.e. to convey the subtle textures of a landscape; to chill us with the eeriness of a dusky, poorly lit room etc. She has the ability to transport the reader to the place she is describing, and to me, this is the writing quality that separates the great writers from the merely good.All in all, the book is so well written that, when I look back, I can forgive the rather tedious pace of the first third of the book; in fact, in retrospect, the slow plot development seemed to mesh perfectly with the era of England portrayed in this novel. There was a slower pace of life, a quiet civility with an air of standoffishness that separated the "gentile" class from the lowly servants and working class of the time, and all this added to the realism of the over story. Recommended! 4 1/2 stars

La Traviata: Surely this one work must have the highest ratio of great songs and recognizable tunes in all of operadom.This production at Covent Garden stars Angela Gheorghiu as Violetta, Frank Lopardo as Alfredo and Leo Nucci as Giorgio Germont (Alfredo's father). The conductor is Sir George Solti. The camera placement and switching, as well as editing are well done. The sets were appropriate for the scenes depicted, although the non-party scenes were rather drab and austere. Angela Gheorghiu's dresses were sumptuous and a compliment to her good looks and figure.I found the opening scene, although well done, rather stiff. It is in the final two acts, however, that the singing and acting ability of the performers comes through. Angela Gheorghiu interpretation of the fatally ill Violetta is nothing short of breath taking. Her use of hand action and facial expressions to augment her mood is extremely well done and conveys the delight or sorrow she's feeling at any given time.Frank Lopardo has a wonderful voice and acts out a very credible Alfredo. The final scene with him and Violetta is heart wrenching.The only weak acting performance is that of Leo Nucci as Georgi Germont. He seemed to me to be very stiff, mannequin like, and in a couple spots in the middle act he looks directly at the camera. I find when this happens I lose my sense of involvement in the performance and I'm snapped back into reality: Annoying! (Thus the loss of one star)The background music of the final act is the epitome of the melody perfectly fitting the mood of the scene that is being preformed. (In this case Violetta last moments before dying) Angela Gheorghiu' is at her absolute best in this tragic ending and the chemistry between her and Alfredo will touch your heart.All in all, a magnificent performance. A La Traviata worth having.

Another great addition to the "Malazan Book of the Fallen" series.Erikson's latest book (the 7th in the series) is set in the locale of Lether; an area that has been conquered by the Tiste Edur but is stilled "governed" by the Letheriis (with some non-too subtle direction from the Edur). Some internal strife is beginning to show and the backstabbing and double dealing has begun. As with previous books in the series, there are several side tales that add to the overall enjoyment of this latest installment.The book is rife with the Erikson's usual host of intriguing characters; some kinky, some downright perverted and some with unusual talents and skills. Needless to say these various personalities can make for interesting exchanges at times...with sometimes unexpected results.As well as the usual cast of our favorite Malazan army regulars (although not introduced until about halfway through), this novel reacquaints us with two old friends from "Midnite Tides"; that being Tehol and Bugg. These were two of my favorite "benign" characters from that novel and they've returned with their usual weird (but often funny), devious schemings.In addition, at the front of the book there is a good map and a list of characters (with brief descriptions) that you'll meet in this novel.What makes this (and others in the series) so good?...it's Erikson's extraordinary skill with prose; that ability to seemingly transport you to the scene of the action using the vehicle of the written word on paper...amazing. I've been a devoted Erikson fan ever since the first book ("Gardens of the Moon") and feel his works easily rank beside the upper echelon of writers of the fantasy genre.My only minor complaint of this work would be that I found one side story a little hard to follow at times...but this doesn't take away anything from the overall quality of this excellent novel.900 pages long and these seemed to just fly by; I can hardly wait for the next installment. 5 Stars... more if I could.R. Nicholson

A great fantasy read!Although Erikson's style and skill as a fantasy writer is evident throughout this entire series (and also in his short stories, "Blood Follows" and "The Healthy Dead"); I feel this is his finest writing achievement to date... let me elaborate a little.As with his other books in this Malazan series, there are several story lines in this novel as well, but the main tale of Coltaine and his soldiers of the Seventh Malazan Army simply excels; this hopelessly outnumbered group tries to protect thousands of refugees while traveling vast distances across hostile terrain and against countless odds. It was to me, one of the truly stirring, written accounts of any epic journey... anywhere; one of those rare narratives that has the ability to sweep you up and almost make you a part of the story line. I was emotionally involved with the telling of this wonderfully drawn out tale and unashamedly distraught at it's end.Some "side" stories (for example, Mappo and Icarium and also that of Fiddler and Kalam, to mention a couple) are nearly as good the main plot, with their own interesting twists and turns.All in all, just great fantasy writing! If you love this genre, you simply must have this book. Highly recommended!

This is a first rate Die Fledermaus!I watched this DVD last nite for the first time and what a pleasant surprise. Right from the opening chords of the overture you could tell that the conductor Carlos Kleiber obviously loved this work, and the orchestra responded in kind to his caressful approach(see some video of him in the latter part of the opera) to conducting this piece.The opera takes place at the Bavarian State Opera Ballet and is performed before a live audience that was in a very receptive and appreciative mood.The video director was Brian Large. Superb! Really, you can have the best singers, orchestra and sets but if the camera angles and switching isn't done properly then the final product can be very mediocre. No worry here.The singing is stellar: with Eberhard Wachter (Gabriel von Eisenstein), Pamela Coburn (Rosalinde) and Janet Perry (Adele) in the leading roles. The acting is good: light hearted, honest and the overall production is really very funny, without seemingly to have to try to be funny. The cast genuinely seemed to be having a great time on stage and responded enthusiastically to the audience's appreciative applause.And then.... there were the costumes(especially the ladies) and the sets: Absolutely gorgeous, sumptuous. Perfectly fitting for the setting that this work was written for.I would have no hesitation in recommending this wonderful, funny opera to anyone. You will love this "Fledermaus"

A strange novel!I'd found this title by chance; I'd been perusing some reviews on a fantasy title and a reviewer had mentioned this work as a interesting read.Rather than a true fantasy story, I'd have to classify this book in the paranormal horror (mild) genre. I must admit this is not one of my favorite themes and as a result, this tale did not really work for me.The story itself is well written and easy to read; it starts very innocently (so benignly in fact, that I almost quit this book after the first chapter or so because I was bored) and then proceeds to get more "strange" as it winds its way toward its conclusion.This novel was not exactly what I was looking or hoping for, but I 'm sure there are readers that enjoy this genre and may very well be pleased with this book.

This is a 3rd person shooter with RPG type upgrades.This game was offered on 'Steam' for under $10.00 so I took a chance and purchased it; a good decision.There is nothing fancy here, mediocre graphics, OK sound, BUT the game is fun. Basically it's just non-stop alien slaughter that results in blood and body parts everywhere.The Pros:1.)What makes the game interesting is the large choice of characters, weapons, skills and upgrades (this also gives the game some replay value).2.)The game is playable on easy, normal and impossible (but this is changeable anytime in the game, even mid level).3.)You get to drive a vehicle with a Gatling gun and also a tank; both will give new meaning to the words 'weapons of mass destruction'.4.)The game was a definite challenge at times; it's basically you alone (with some minor exceptions) against hordes of aliens. Because of this, you do need to consider how you will spend your hard earned XPs (on upgrades and/or skills) and your money (on weapons and/or armor).The Cons:1.)You can have up to 5 lives, but there are no game saves; so if you die fairly well along in a level (and in dying, have used up your last life), you'll have to repeat the entire level all over again. Luckily, most of the levels aren't particularly long, however, having said that, there were a couple levels that were a real pain to start over again.2.)My character got stuck a couple times where I couldn't move and had to restart a level.Conclusion:This is your basic run and gun, not-much-thinking-required, shooter; but the various weapons and upgrades made this game great fun to play; plus the price was very reasonable. 5 Stars.

'The Quiet American' is set in Vietnam in the early-mid 1950's. The French have just begun to realize the futility of trying to help the mass illiterate embrace democracy, all the while fighting an increasingly costly jungle styled war against insurgents.This is the story of Fowler and Pyle (the quiet American ). Fowler is an English reporter and has been covering the war for some time, while Pyle is newly arrived and attached to the American diplomatic branch; a presence which is just starting to become involved in this area of south east Asia. Their paths cross, initially over a girl, and then later through a series of events, causing their destinies to become entwined in ways neither could foresee. Fowler is the main focus of the book, with Pyle dropping in and out just enough to add new twists and developments to the situations that arise.It is a tale of love, lust, intrigue, espionage, and some misguided (misguided, depending on which side your on) ideological thinking. Throw in an occasional skirmish or two and you've got a tense, psychological thriller.Conclusion:I really enjoyed this book. It was in all honesty, a little slow to get into, but somehow, great stories are often like that. Hard to put down...very well done.5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

This game is the long awaited follow up to 'Farcry' (one of the best FPSs of 2004). We now finally get a look at this newest offering.Here are some of the things that I've liked in the single player mode...1.)This is a FPS in which your nano armor gives you special 'skills"; these 'skills' include enhanced speed, strength, armor and invisibility; and you'll need them all to survive.2.)Graphics that are smooth and flowing...plus excellent audio; both add a spooky, creepy ambiance to this jungle based horror game.3.)The ability to use and control vehicles (on land, at sea and in the air), as well as the mounted weapons on these units.4.)Generally good (but not great) enemy AI! Although some will just stand out in the open, there are some that will sneak up on you or hide behind cover; also they must reload empty weapons. Due to their larger numbers and the fact they're usually spread out, will necessitate your using your special 'skills' and the surrounding environment to defeat them. This is the basic, reoccurring challenge for this game.5.)Easy, anytime save/loads with F5/F9 respectively, as well as game generated checkpoint saves.6.)If your taking a beating (or find it too easy), you can change the degree of game difficulty anytime, as you play; you don't have to start a new game. This is a nice feature!Cons:1.)I've had a couple freeze ups, requiring reboot; also some minor video fragmentation (after extended periods of play).2.)I found the controls on flying the VTOL (vertical take-off & landing) craft were difficult to operate (the plane just didn't seem to respond to commands quickly) with the result of frequent crashes.3.)There was one extended section where you were floating (in either space or water), that I found confusing, tedious and boring. I was lucky it was very linear, or I might never have gotten out of there.4.)A high end system is preferable. Although playable on XP, Vista can use Dx10, and combined with good hardware and a high end video card, it does make a difference in being able to run a lot of the 'extra' graphic details.Conclusion:All the pre-release hype made it sound as if this game would easily qualify for Game of the Year honors; I don't think so. Graphically it is beautiful and it is a good game, but it's not a great game! If you liked 'Farcry' then you'll probably like 'Crysis'. Was it worth the wait...probably, but somehow I was expecting something more. Over all, I liked 'Farcry' and its gameplay a little more. However, still worth a 4 1/2-5 Star rating.

Some comments on the 3 new components of this 5 game package.Episode 2...a worthy sequel to Episode 1...In fact, qualities good enough (IMO) to think that it might have contended for single player, Game of the Year*, (however, its shorter overall length would probably preclude this honor.)This game was all that I'd hoped for; it has some great battles, an extended car driving component, an interesting new weapon (towards the end), a compelling story line, a hint of humor and a touching, emotional ending.In addition, it has smooth flowing graphics, well sync'd voice and lip movement and a few interesting puzzles. Also, the way the other characters (i.e. Alyx, Dr. Vance etc.) watch you and turn their bodies to adjust to your position (Freeman) is remarkable; very realistic.My only small complaint would be that the first quarter of the game was a little drawn out and repetitious; however this is only a minor concern in an otherwise incredible PC game.Easily 5 Stars...more if I could.*****Portal...quirky and different but fun!A rather unique, single player puzzle game that involves going in and out of doors; doors you make with (what else), your portal gun. However, this task is not quite as easy as it sounds; to accomplish your goals you must use strategies of lateral thinking, timing and momentum to get through all 19 different levels. Of course the challenges become more complicated as you progress and to win the game (and escape), you must defeat the increasingly neurotic test-facility robotess in the finale. Great fun!This spacial concepts took a little time to get use to, but once the basics were mastered this was an interesting and fun exercise in abstract thinking and puzzle solving. 4 Stars.*****Team Fortress 2...non-stop actionAn excellent addition to the original TF. The gameplay could best be described as multiplayer chaos, with everyone running around like mad trying to survive. It is, however, great fun. 5 Stars.Conclusion:Great value for the money; 1 new game, 2 new sequels, plus a couple of old games thrown in (games that, for anyone who likes this genre, has already played long ago). Overall package...5+ Stars.*other nominees for single player 'Game of the Year' might be 'Bioshock' and "Call of Duty 4', with 'Timeshift' and 'STALKER-Chernobyl' close runner ups and 'Crysis' in a more distant grouping.

I really liked this player!It has many good features and I've only one minor negative comment...let me elaborate.The pros;1.)light weight and small (but appears to be solidly built); easily portable for travel.2.)comes with car plug adapter so it can be used in your vehicle.3.)has 2 ports so you have the option of using one port for headphones with the main speaker on, or the second port for use with the main speakers muted. (Really useful in the car or motel room when you want to watch or listen to something while someone else uses the radio or tv)4.)comes with an a/v connecter cord so you can hook this unit up to a TV set.5.)LCD image is very clear...screen angle is adjustable (by tilting forward or back) to give the best picture.6.)There is a menu button that gives you control over such things as type of stereo output, subtitles and the ability to go directly to any cut on the DVD.7.)It also comes with a fully functioning remote.8.)Comes with a lithium rechargable battery that reportedly will give you about 2-3 hours of use.The con; (singular)The only negative point I've come across with this unit is the fast forward or rewind function (using the >> keys); the key is small and must be held down it order to fast forward/rewind, making it easy to misjudge how far forward or back you wish to go. However, that being said, this is only a small annoyance in a otherwise well made product.All in all, a compact, portable DVD player and, as with most Samsung products I've purchased before, a well built, reliable piece of electronics.

"Mary and O'Neil" was the debut book for Justin Cronin in 2001. It subsequently won him the PEN/Hemmingway Award and also the Stephen Crane Prize in literature. The book is 243 pages in length.I purchased this book because I'd just finished Cronin's latest effort, "The Passage", and was so impressed by its quality I want to try other books he'd written."Mary and O'Neil" is basically a book containing 8 short stories mainly about the people mentioned in title, plus, and to a somewhat lesser degree, their surrounding families and friends . Chronologically, the book covers 8 distinct periods between the year 1976 and 2000. And although there are gaps (in years) between each chapter, they are all connected in important ways. We first meet O'Neil at age nineteen (as well as his family) in the first segment and finish with him as a 40 year old husband (to Mary), teacher and father in the last chapter.What is it about this book that is so wonderful? First, Cronin displays a magical touch for his descriptive passages of nature. One can almost see the beautiful snowy nights or the autumn leaves and yet this is the least of his writing attributes...where he really shines is in his ability to describe and give the reader a real feeling of human emotion when it is under duress and is extremely vulnerable.As well as happy moments, there were moments in this book of subtle sadness and other areas of poignant clarity...things that it made me reminisce to some of my adolescent and early adulthood days. For all that this book has going for it, I believe its greatest asset is its ability to make the reader reflect back to their own era when they were growing up and maturing, often giving them some new insight into things and events in earlier times that they may have been forgotten...tucked away in some recess of their mind. I was surprise how often that some of the things that occurred in this story, made me think of my own days gone by. Frequently with a very eye opening and sobering effect.Conclusion:A beautiful love story, but more than that...a glimpse into lives that very well may allow you the privilege of reflecting on your own. Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A book that started well, but was ultimately disappointing.The year is 1902 and Vienna is at the height of its glory, sporting many unique shops, entertainment venues, fine museums and was home to the rich and famous of the day. The novel features a mysterious locked room murder, that results in inspector Oskar Rheinhardt and psychologist-physician Dr. Max Liebermann becoming involved to try to solve the crime.The descriptive writing had a pleasant ambiance to it, detailing an early 20th century Vienna and its surrounding area. We also meet with some interesting characters within the frame work of the investigation, some of which are, of course, the suspects. And there are several subplots referred to on a regular interval that, although not directly involved with the murder, have a tangible effect on the story has a whole.So what was wrong with the tale of this mysterious murder...end-novel unbelievability!The book went along quite well for the first 4/5...an intriguing tale but with a lot of apparent dead ends; I was beginning to wonder if the culprits would ever be apprehended, and then...*PARTIAL SPOILER*Out of the blue, one of the side characters suggest two theories as to1.) how the murderer left the room (it was locked from the inside) and2.) how the murder itself was committed.Although the two theories suggested regarding these murder solving details were not entirely outside the realm of possibility, given the information available and characters involved, but they were a definite stretch...extremely remote to say the least; especially considering the time-frame and era involved. I had the feeling of having receiving last gasp information not previous presented to the reader, solely for the purpose of solving this crime because we'd reached the end of the book.*END SPOILER*Conclusion:A generally well written, murder mystery but with a highly unlikely ending, taking the entire novel down several notches. Too bad really, the story had a definite appealing feel to it...however, as it is 2 to 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson

This DVD is the movie version of Giselle filmed by the CBC in Canada in the mid 70's. The cast is highlighted by National Ballet of Canada stars Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn: both in their prime.There were highs and lows, in my view, associated with this Giselle.... To mention a fewThe pros- Separately, both Kain and Augustyn are excellent dancers; (see some of Mr. Ausgustyn's solos in the 2nd act). The emotional interpretations required in this ballet were generally well done by both principal dancers.-The sets were detailed and attractive for both the village and forest scenes. The costumes were colorful for the main dancers as well as the corps de ballet, however the attire for the nobles in the latter part of the 1st scene was simply sumptuous.-The camera work and film edit is, without doubt, the best of all the Giselles I've seen: the cameras tended to move in and out with the dancers on stage, so that there is not a lift or jump that is not viewed from the best vantage point.The cons...-The lack of spontaneity and enthusiastic response from a live audience in hard to measure and describe, but it definitely noticeable and sorely missed in this production.-The audio is mono: maybe not a big point, but I must admit that having gotten use to listening to almost everything in Dolby Stereo, I now find mono really dull and lifeless.-and last, I found that some of the lifts and glides from the pas de deux in the 2nd act were somewhat stiff and well... almost forced...even rushed. This is hard to understand in a movie version of a ballet: a dance segment could be repeated over and over until the perfect one was captured on film and edited into the final cut. Such is, unfortunately, not the case. Then again, maybe it was the choreographer who intended these maneuvers to be presented in this fashion. To me, the finale of this ballet is what Giselle is all about; Adam's haunting melodies accompanying those fabulous, smooth, unhurried lifts and glides that just leave me breathless and in awe of such unbelievable talent and skills. It just didn't happen in this Giselle.All in all, this is a solid, well done performance (and you will probably never see a better filmed and edit production of Giselle), but the less than satisfying dancing interpretation shown in the pas de deux of the 2nd act has resulted in a Giselle that has been left wanting and me a little disappointed.

A magnificent tale!'A Tale of Two Cities' is one of my favorite Dickens' novels. Although set in London and Paris, most of story deals with the turmoil in France in the late 1700s. The glory days of Louis XIV are over and the starving populace is not only out for food, but also for revenge after years of abuse and virtual slavery. Unfortunately, as is often the case in perilous times, many innocent people get caught up in the conspiracy theories of the revolution's overzealous patriots; and thus the setting for the heroes of this tale is set.Well written and evenly paced, this novel will hold your attention through to the very end. Character development is superb as Dickens able to create real-life characters not only for the wrongly accused, but also for those caught up in the 'meting out of justice'.A sad, but beautiful novel; a tale of hope and tragedy, in this most infamous period of French history. 5 Stars.

"The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley" E-book edition is a work of fiction by reknowned author Betty Dravis. This Kindle version is a 485 Kb download.Jeremy is a young boy with a successful cartoon series, but when one of the characters, Doog suddenly comes off the computer screen into Jeremy's bedroom things change forever. Doog's arrival sets in motion a series of events that include a rogue group of toonies that want to leave Cartoon Land and take over the world.Dravis has a wonderful style of writing that will appeal to both young and adult readers. The action, dialogues and story line are fast paced and interesting from beginning to end. Adults should be forewarned that there are a couple scenes in this book that could be very disturbing to a younger reader.Conclusion:A fast, easy read...I really enjoyed this unique little book. As a hard core fantasy reader I was pleasantly surprised that the author saw fit to put in a few scenes that were definitively graphic (violent). Well written and destined to become a classic within its own circle. 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.This is the type of work that if Betty Dravis were English, I could see a knighthood in her future. Hmmm...Dame Betty Dravis...golly-by-golly that has a nice ring to it.

A great novel!This book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing. The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before; you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's " Cold Mountain". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.Highly recommended!

The 'Furies of Calderon' is the first book in the 'Codex Alera' series by Jim Butcher.I've been a fan of Butcher's Dresden novels, featuring famed vampire fighter Harry Dresden. So when I saw this book was available and it had received generally high reviews, I was eager to get into this book.When I started this tale I was impressed; I thought I'd finally found the holy grail of fantasy books...that being a writer that was possibly equal to, or at least comparable in fantasy writing skills as George R.R. Martin ('Ice and Fire' series). However, my initial enthusiasm quickly fell away, replaced by the realization I'd stumbled upon a very good story, but unfortunately, supported by mediocre story telling.First, the good:All the ingredients for first rate fantasy were there; magic, unique characters and creatures, deceit, treachery and some perilous treks through dangerous territories. There was even a hint of romance and some subtle erotic moments. The plot for the story itself was noteworthy with the classic good vs evil motif. Then coupled that with Butcher's proven ability to weave magic through the written word (as he's done so many times before with the Dresden Files) and you should have an outstanding tale...should have.However, I have a principle regarding fantasy writing, as defined by the following statement...'TO HAVE GOOD (OR GREAT) FANTASY, IT MUST BE, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF FANTASY WRITING, BELIEVABLE'And with my statement in mind, these are my concerns: ***No specific spoilers, BUT, read at your own risk***1.)There was one mode of travel, that seemed utterly unrealistic; unrealistic, even given the fact that magic was a factor. (and exceedingly advantageous to the party(s) involved)2.)Grievously injured characters that were able to keep going on and on and on.3.)One character kept popping up, unforeseen and unexpected and usually at the most unlikely and inappropriate time. I remember one instance where I said to myself 'not again, this is unbelievable'.4.)Battles (both large and small) throughout the book, that seemed destined to end in gloom and doom, had outcomes reversed at the last moment by someone or something arriving in the nick of time to save the day.5.)Many of the characters appeared to be too nice, too fair, too forgiving...too much alike. Several of the 'good guys' appeared 'squeaky clean'; just unrealistic traits for so many different personalities, especially in this perilous setting.6.)And finally, no map! I realize some readers don't care if a map is provided in stories such as this, but I do. This book was the perfect example of a tale where a map could have been so useful to define distances and geographic locales.Conclusion;A very interesting first book in this series and it does hold promise for future installments. The story had an excellent beginning, but ultimately succumbed to some writing techniques that were of questionable benefit. 2 1/2 to 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A good, fun entertaining read.This book (the fourth in the Artemus Fowl series), while it might have been intended for an adolescent audience, has an adult sense of humor and cynicism. The plot is face paced, witty, and clever in its development; it also has several spots that are funny enough to give you an unexpected chuckle or two.All in all a satisfying continuation of the Artemus series. Recommended for anyone, any age with a liking for books leaning to the fantasy/adventure genre.

This is a DVD release of a movie that was originally filmed in 1948. "The Red Shoes" is about a ballet company owned by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) He discovers a unknown composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring), and a new leading ballerina, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer), to play the lead in a new ballet called "The Red Shoes". This is basically the oft repeated story of joyous success and love followed by separation and tragedy.Whether you like this movie or not will depend on what you are looking for. If you wanted a show of some historical significance that was considered a ground-breaking achievement at its time, then this may be a show that you will really enjoy. To a movie-buff/collector this would probably be looked upon as an archival gem.If however, you are looking for great acting then I'd advise you to spend your money elsewhere. The plot is not bad, but really, the acting by today's standards is mediocre at best. There is however, is some good dancing in this show by Ms. Shearer.All in all, an expensive DVD. Not what I was looking for. I hope these comments will be useful to you if you are considering purchasing this disc.

A wonderful culinary series!This is a set of four DVDs that contain various recipes of just about every conceivable type of food offering; there is beef, seafood, chicken, lamb, pasta, bread, soups, sauces, pizza, desserts and salads.I initially saw some of these episodes on PBS TV where each show would encompass a hour cooking class. Because I love to cook I became very interested in this series and eventually decided to purchase all four discs; there are many positive features to be found here (and a couple of niggling negatives as well)...let me elaborate a little.The Pros:1.) Each disc has 6 or 7 main themes; within each "theme" there are several "complimentary" dishes that go with the main recipe. e.g. If the main topic was seafood, the lesson might include a salad, sauce or dessert to go with the main course.2.) Most shows have a brief discussion on wine; usually in context of what vintage might be most appropriate for the meal being prepared.3.) Each show features Joanne Weir with a guest student who helps her prepare the food choice of the day. What quickly becomes evident is that both Joanne and the student (with one exception) really love to cook and prepare food. If there is one thing that comes shining through in these lessons, it is the atmosphere created by people doing what they love and loving what they do; this positive attitude towards cooking really make the shows fun to watch.4.) These cooking classes are really a hands on learning experience for the students and this is a real asset to the viewer of the DVD. In the course of the food preparation, the student and Joanne often discuss a host of culinary topics that result in lots of cooking tips and technique suggestions; these are just little nuggets of cooking information that are just not obtainable from reading a recipe from paper.5.) Each recipe is printable on a home computer; there are about 70 recipes available is this series.6.) Technically, the discs were professionally filmed and edited, with one exception, [see Cons: 4.) below], resulting in a superior DVD product that to me, was very reasonably priced.The Cons:1.) There is no printed list or index of all the different recipes that are used in this cooking series. Finding a specific recipe will take some searching in the electronic folders of the DVD itself. [see 2.) below]2.) The recipes are not viewable on your TV set. There are, however, two ways to view and print the recipes that are on the disc; both require a computer with a DVD player.a.) while at your computer, go to the drive icon in which you have inserted the DVD, right click, press "explore", and you will find an "index" icon that will take you to a website that contains all the recipes and you can print them from there.b.) similarly, there is also a "pdf" folder that contains the recipes and they are printable from there. However, once you are into this folder, the name beneath each recipe icon is poorly illustrated, so it makes finding the exact recipe you want a little more difficult than what it needs to be.3.) Some of the ingredients used, may not be available in all areas.( but in fairness to Joanne, she was aware of this and often suggests substitutions)4.) On my set of discs, the lesson on "Handmade Pasta" (disc "C") cut off after only 8 minutes and exited to the credits; lets hope this was a problem unique to my DVDs and not a defect on all disc "C"s.The first 3 concerns I've mentioned above are really more of an inconvenience; the 4th a little more serious. However, I was still very pleased with the overall quality of instruction and the highly professional way the series was produced.Conclusion...A useful, well presented cooking series; if you love cooking and if the kitchen is a place of comfort and good vibrations for you, then these DVDs will be a welcome addition in your home. 5+ Stars!

An interesting story, but I'm not sure one I really enjoyed.Being a fan of Stroud's Bartimus series I was looking forward to another good fantasy read, however this effort was much different than what I'd expected. It started out with what seemed like an promising fantasy tale, but gradually turned out to be an increasingly dark psychological thriller.All in all, this book is well written and has a sense of style, pace and atmosphere. Stroud has the ability to take the reader into a story and I must admit to a feeling of creepy discomfort as I approached the end of this short novel.A good book, but just not a book that I could classify as one of my favorites. 3-3 1/2 Stars

I've watched this version of Carmen several times and like it more and more each viewing.This is the first opera I've watched as a movie and the effect is certainly different than before a live audience. I don't think any movie can compare to having the performance done in the intimate setting of an opera house: and this is the reason it took me a while to appreciate this work. Having said that, this production does please the visual and auditory senses. The scenes are beautiful with a pastel quality to them: just enough color for warmth and atmosphere to complement the locations. Some of the views are panoramic while others a close-up.The roles of Carmen and Don Jose are done by Julia Migenes -Johnson and Placido Domingo respectively. It is hard to imagine two better people for the leads.Although Julia Migenes-Johnson has a wonderful husky voice that complements her part, it is her acting that is truly outstanding. Swiveling hips, swishing raised skirts, ringlet hair and the look that absolutely makes her the genuine temptress and seductress that her part calls for. How could poor Don Jose not fall for her?Placido Domingo's interpretation of Don Jose is stellar. Handsome with a voice to die for! Watching his downward spiral as his relationship with Carmen deteriorates is, from a male perspective, hard to watch. The begging and pleading are heart wrenching and you cannot help feel sorry for Don Jose while at the same time wishing he would stand up for himself.My two favorite scenes are the beautifully choreographed and sung "Habanera" and the finale "It's you! It's me!"All in all a wonderful production of Bizet's Carmen in movie form. Highly recommended if you don't mind losing the stage effect of a live production

After a long wait, the 4th book in the Ice and Fire series has finally arrived; with mixed enthusiasm by some of the reviewers. I found this to be an enjoyable book with a few minor reservations...let me explain.The pros:One of the finest assets that this series (and has continued with this book) has been the authors' great literary skills in story-telling, plotting and descriptive writing. It has all the ingredients for the type of fantasy I love, that being love, honor and devotion mixed with a liberal dose of betrayal, lust, deceit and unspeakable cruelty. This series is second to none in having the characters " telling it like it is" and invoking a strong visceral reaction in its readers.There is an incredibly detailed list of ALL the characters (Houses, families and individuals) in these novels, at the end of this book: reading this makes you appreciate just how much effort has gone into making this monumental series.The cons:(listed from minor to more important)1.)The maps and geographic locations:I found a significant portion of this book took place in locales that I could not find on the maps provided, such sites as "Duskendale", "Maidenpool", and "Braavos" for instance. The same can be said of some of the waterways. For example, I could not figure out where Brienne was until near the end of her story. The strange thing is, that the map is very detailed with many names and places that were never involved with the story at all.2.)Dragged out, uneventful sections:There were two characters whose tale seemed somewhat redundant in the telling; that being Samwise and Arya (and to some degree the tale of Sansa Stark). In fact, it got to the point were I had trouble holding my interest in these sections and started skimming the chapters concerned, just to get through them.3.)Lack of my favorite characters:I must admit I sorely missed Tyrion and Jon Snow in this novel. (although keeping up to date with Cercei and Jaime was enjoyed, and in fact, their stories really held this book together)All in all, not the best book in the series, but it is a good book. Let's hope Mr. Martin was just taking a breather before delivering us with the next installment.

Mordecai Richler has been one of my favorite Canadian authors (Steven Erikson [fantasy] is another) for a long time and 'Barney's Version', is my favorite of all his novels.'Barney's Version' was in fact, my introduction to Richler. From there I followed his literary offerings with interest, as I gradually read his other works and eagerly looked forward to his weekly column in the national edition of the "National Post" out of Toronto.The story (without giving anything away) is set in Quebec, Canada and deals with the slow, subtle disclosure of an old local mystery. The quality of this work, is like fine wine; smooth, delicious and always leaving you with a taste for just a little more. Richler's strengths are his use of prose, his exquisite sense of cynical humor and his ability to tell a wonderful story. This is a book that actually made me laugh out loud, many times.Conclusion:Perhaps Richler's finest work (a subjective opinion of course). But try this book, I'm sure you'll not be disappointed and you may discover (if you haven't already) one of Canada's finest literary figures.5 Stars...more if I could.R.NicholsonP.S.Canada lost one of it's truly great writers and story tellers when Mordecai Richler died a few years back. His passing has created a void in his writing genre that has yet to be filled.

An interesting Civil War love story/adventure written by Paulette Jiles.First, let me say that I felt some concern in trying to write a meaningful review on this novel; this is because of what I perceived as different degrees of writing excellence in this book. Let me explain.....I really wanted to like this book, as I have a great interest in stories involving the era surrounding the American civil war. Also the tantalizing review on the front cover, which reads " 'Enemy Women' deserves the Pulitzer Prize", had me drooling to get into this story. However, I don't think I could honestly say that it deserves a Pulitzer because I found that the quality of writing of this work seems to fall into two categories: initially average, and then terrific.The first third of the book seemed to be somewhat slow and ponderous. Coincidental happenings seemed all too predictable, so much so, that I almost discarded this book at this point but persevered on, and I'm glad I did.The latter part, however, was a tour de force of intriguing and suspenseful story telling of the finest quality and the book become difficult to put down. I found here an imaginative, addictive style of writing that seemed far removed from the techniques used at the beginning of this work: a narrative approach that at times reminded me of Charles Frazier's " Cold Mountain". (Another magnificent Civil War story of epic proportions) It just kept getting better and better.All in all a good read. . Recommended.

Another book where I was fooled by an intriguing cover and some glowing reports on the inside pages by some enthralled reviewers.I've always had a passion for good fantasy writing and I'd hoped this effort from Jo Walton would scratch that itch; unfortunately no pruritic relief here.When I read one of the cover reviews comparing this work to Austin's 'Pride and Prejudice' I didn't really believe it but I decided to try it anyway. However, it's true, this is a tale about dragons that are basically Victorian era-like creatures that act and interact like real people, having the 'normal' inter-relational concerns with such things as marriage, children, strife, conflict etc. They even have religious beliefs and clergy.Unfortunately, this story just didn't work for me; I kept saying to myself, as I slogged through this novel (frequently skimming sections)..."this is ridiculous, why didn't the author just write this story using real people instead of dragons"? Other than a few dragon traits (gold hording, breathing fire etc.) there was little or no benefit to using dragons vs people as the main characters. Even then, I'm not sure using people would have improved this work significantly, given the level of writing. 1-1 1/2 Stars

This is one of my favourite booksA story of improbable,intermitant love between Ada (a preacher's daughter) and Inman (a soldier). The story is set during the latter part of the Civil War: replete with all the sacrifices and deprivation that accompanied this era of American history.Initially, this book was a little hard to get into; but then, so beautifully written and engrossing, it became hard to put down.I must tell you that there were a few occasions in this book that literally took my breath away: descriptions of some subtle unexpected event or scene that jolts the readers senses. There is one moment of such compassionate violence that I still think of, even though I read this book a couple of years ago.In short, a masterpiece of writing and story telling: one of these rare books you hate to see come to an end.

"The Stand: Expanded Edition" is a re-release of a previous novel of the same name by Stephen King. This book is 1141 pages in length.*SPOILER*Human error has resulted in a 'superflu' being released within the USA and it eventually spreads throughout the world...with only a few survivors that, for some unknown reason, have immunity. Survivors who, strangely enough, all seem to be having the same recurrent nightmarish dreams; dreams that seem to be herding them to a small dilapidated farm in Nebraska. As the story follows several characters the reader is gradually made aware of a dark and sinister force that seems to be behind some of these strange happenings. It becomes apparent that a some sort of confrontation is going to occur between the good guys gathering in Boulder CO. and the evil Anti-God daemon and his forces in Las Vegas NV.*END SPOILER*The basic premise for the plot and subsequent story was as good one. Some horror, some tense, intriguing moments and (at times) exceedingly good story telling. BUT, there are extended areas within the book that focus on dragged out, mundane snippets of personal character tales, and it's these that add several hundred of extra pages to this already very long book. True, these areas were vaguely related to the overall main plot but on the very periphery...they could have been just as easily been left out and nothing would have been lost or taken away from the main theme. Fortunately, it was easy to recognize these spots and skim through them, allowing me to concentrate on the more main-theme areas of the story.Honestly, it would not have been a hard thing to give up on this book completely, however when you've invested a larger number of hours of reading to get over 1/2 or 2/3 way through one of these mega-books it's hard to justify just stopping on page, say 800.Conclusion:A story with a solid foundation and intriguing plot that I really enjoyed, but was filled with so many soft and dragged out sub-stories, that it just seemed to go on forever. Hard to maintain interest...hard not to skim. 2 StarsRay Nicholson

A gripping, stirring account of one man's survival through the war years: Wladyslow Szpilman is a Polish Jew whose talents as a pianist help him barely endure the holocaust years of Nazi occupied Warsaw.The book admirably shows the survival instinct of man: just when it doesn't look like it can get any worse, it does: and yet he is able to persevere with a little cunning and sometimes a lot of luck. Also accurately depicted is the disturbing recurring theme of how evil can grow and flourish in people when there is nothing to constrain it. A "Lord of the Flies " all over again, only on a grander scale.All in all a compelling read. Well written and hard to put down. Highly recommended!

A magnificent DVD! Simply breathtaking !This DVD features excerpts from performances of the Kirov Ballet at Covent Garden and an open-air concert from Red Square in Moscow.It is difficult to know were to start: there are so many exquisite performances on this disc. I will pick out a few (really, you could mention all of them)The beauty, grace and sensitivity of Julia Makhalina as Odette(with Andris Liepa) in the Adagio from "Swan Lake".The obvious joy and subtle sadness, coupled with the incredible dancing skill of Altynai Asylmuratova and Konstantin Zaklinsky in " The Leaves Are Fading "; music by Antonin Dvorak.The unbelievable athletic abilities of Farukh Ruzimatov in his Pas de deux with Larisa Lezhina from Drigo's "Diana and Actaeon".And then there were the young dancers from the Vaganova Ballet Academy doing a wonderful job on Minkus's "Paquita: Polonaise and Mazurka" and also a credible rendition of the Dance of the Mirlitons from Tchaikovsky's " The Nutcracker"Overall, I personally enjoyed the Covent Garden section a little more and yet my favorite piece is probably the Pas de deux from the Act II of Giselle (Adam) by Carole Arbo and Kader Belarbi; the smoothness, the height of the lifts, the glides, the quiet touches and the grace of both performers is simply hard to believe.As a bonus there is a short commentary on the history of ballet by Ruth Leon in the accompanying booklet that is interesting reading.All in all, some great performances of the greatest ballet scenes you'll ever find on one disc. Highly recommended!

I was unable to get a consistent, satisfactory signal with this unit because of the antenna; the rest of the unit worked fine.I found that unless you had perfect exposure to the satellite that this antenna did not receive the signal very well. Also, the least movement of the connecting cord or if someone moved a blind/curtain, this would disturb the exact positioning required to make this antenna function properly.In the end I returned this unit and got an extra car antenna (the one with the strong magnet); this allowed me to put an extension cord under the window sill to the outside. From here, I was able to easily find a site for the magnetic antenna that resulted in excellent satellite reception (exact positioning is not nearly as important for the magnet antenna). Since then my home unit has worked perfectly.So...0 Stars for the headache in finding a secure, undisturbed spot for this unit. Makes you wonder if anyone at the company ever tried this unit before it went to market.Ray Nicholson

One of the best sci-fi books I've ever read.This book is the second of six in the 'Ender' series by Orsen Scott Card. It continues on with Ender's story, albeit some 3000 years after the first book. And although there is barely any resemblance between book 1 and book 2, you won't be able to make much sense of book 2 without having read and understood the ramification of book 1.The setting for this book is a far off distant planet; the tale is one of emerging discovery not only between individuals but also between species. i.e. humans and a new alien life form found there. I found that Card has done much more with his character development of people (and aliens as well) in this book, giving them a much broader depth of character, moral fiber and some individual weaknesses and shortcomings. This tale seemed to be more about the 'people' in the book, rather than solely about the circumstances they find themselves in (well, this statement is not completely accurate, but you'll understand what I mean once you begin reading).On the broader scale this book could be view as a microcosm of life on earth; replete with different groups, different races; all with their own unique and different agendas, encompassed within a sphere of distrust and misunderstanding. Card does a masterful job of drawing the characters and story together to make one very satisfying, magnificent read.I do have some minor concerns for this book, but I'll comment in a P.S. As this may constitute a spoiler to some.Conclusion:O.S. Card has written a sci-fi novel for the ages and although different from 'Ender's Game' as it can possible be, was better in many regards. I found the story and writing...addictive!. The book itself was almost impossible to put down; I always had to read one more chapter. And despite my minor protestations below, this book easily rates 5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.My concerns *** possible SPOILER ***1.)The alien race that was discovered on this new planet were referred to as 'piggies' because their physical features had pig-like characteristics. Somehow the manner and tone with which this obviously very intelligent race of aliens was continually referred to, seemed almost racist and somewhat condescending. Let me state that this was different than book 1 (Ender's Game) where the aliens were called 'buggers' (because they looked like insect) but 'buggers' didn't seem to have the same 'off' connotation as 'piggies' because there was no actual personal contact with these aliens, to give them any real endearing identity.2.) The only real flaw I found in the concept and the telling of this story was towards the end, with the 'treaty' drawn up between the 'Piggies' and the humans. The concepts of this 'treaty' were hastily drawn up and even more hastily agreed to than seemed realistically wise; one wonders if the lack of a 'due diligence' process was for the sake of novel brevity. Some of the items within the 'contract' had me thinking..."hmmm, I can see that part of the agreement causing problems a few years into the future."3.)And finally, a real picky point, I can't for the life of me understand reason for the cover on this book; it appears to have nothing to do with the geographic locale where the story occurs, or for that matter, with the story itself...Strange!P.P.S. many thanks to my friend 'Critical Mind' a.k.a. 'the other Ray' for pointing me towards this wonderful set of books.

A thought provoking fictional novel from Yasmina Khadra.The setting for this book is in present day Israel, replete with all the trappings surrounding the pent-up hate, rage and suspicions that predominant this area of the world.*SPOILER*This is the story of a young, well respected, Arab-Israeli surgeon (Dr. Amin Jaafari) who lives and works in Israel. Shortly after he attends to the victims of a suicide bombing (not an unusual occurrence for him) he is made aware of a development that is about to change his life as he knows it; the suicide bomber was his wife! The news is met initially with denial and disbelief, then a grudging acceptance and finally 'why'.The 'why' leads Amin on a dangerous trail of discovery that uncovers and discusses many of the tenets of belief that occupy the thinking of the Arabs and Israeli in this tinderbox known as the Middle East. Needless to say, Dr. Jaafari also discovers many things about himself and his life that had, up to this time, remained hidden from him.*END SPOILER*The story is well written and holds your interest; the book is hard to put down. Khadra's development of the main character, Dr Amin Jaafari, is parallelled superbly with his (Jaafari's) ever increasing knowledge of the extraordinary situation that is opening up before him. My only minor concern with Dr Jaafari's character was that some of the decisions he made on his 'quest' were somewhat ill-advised (IMHO); but this may be partially explained by stress the man was under and also because I'm dealing with a culture and attitude that I'm not familiar with.It is not, as you might imagine, a pleasant tale, but one does get a sense that the author knows what he's talking about when discussing the 'politics' of the area. What I found particularly interesting was that Khadra, in weaving Dr. Jaafari's story, was able to give a deeper insight into the thinking of both sides. You begin on one hand, to understand the Arab sense of repression and the loss on dignity, but as well, the Israeli increasing distrust and frustration for the Arab regime, particularly since the suicide bombings have begun.Conclusion:An intriguing novel. Although fiction, the story is not outside the realm of being plausible.Even more important is the light shed on the circumstances that reflect the partisan thinking that prevails in this area of the world. You begin to understand that hate, rage and distrust have dominated for SO long that it's hard to consider other more peaceful options; hard to consider because for things to changes it would mean that both side would have to 'give a little' and giving a little would mean 'losing face'. And of all the options available, 'losing face' is not one of them. Easily 5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S. Yasmina Khadra also wrote 'The Swallows of Kabul', another one of my favorite books.

The action begins on D-day (June 6, 1944) and then progresses onward as the allies gradually recapture the German occupied territory in Normandy, France. The game has some historical accuracy; with regards to the events occurring around the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath.As with most games there were good and not so good features...let me explainThe Pros:1.)The game was fun to play; the battles certainly are gut wrenching and tend to sweep you up emotionally into them.2.)Good maps, with clear cut instructions as to what needs to be done to complete a mission.3.)Easy to program your units to build troops, vehicles and armored units etc.4.)Many advanced abilities are available to choose from, by spending your Experience Points, (earned in battles) for upgrades.5.)Easy, anytime game saves.6.)Interesting cut movie scenes before and after each mission.The Cons:1.)During the chaos of battle, I found it very difficult to accurately control some units; either getting them to go where I wanted them to go AND/OR do what I wanted them to do. Because there were often multiple units (represented by icons) close together it was sometimes hard to accurately click on the appropriate icon with the CORRECT mouse button. Probably the worst example of this was to try to get a manned artillery cannon pointed the right way and then get them to fire on a specific target. (while all hell was breaking loose and you needed that cannon in a hurry).2.)A limited total number of units (units encompass personnel + buildings + vehicles) at any one time, in any given mission. I seemed to be forever at my unit limits with no way of producing a set of tanks to help my buildings or troops that were being ravaged by German Panther and Tiger tanks. (In other words. I had to let many troops die in order to free up 'space' to make some heavy armor units).3.)However, the most frustrating thing to me was the spontaneous regeneration of German armor or troops in an area you just spent a half hour clearing. (and of course you won these battles by the skin of your teeth with barely any troops or armor left).4.)The tutorial, while it gives the bare basics of game play; has very little in-depth instruction.5.)The computer AI running the enemy could do anything, anywhere and all at once; where as you, the gamer, can only act in one place, on one unit at a time. Hardly seems fair.6.)Picking an upgrade (by spending your hard earned Exp. Points) seemed a trial and error affair; what worked well in one mission, may be of limited use or even useless in another (often, with the end result being restarting level to try to find something more useful).A decent RTS war game, that had great potential, but, I felt, just fell short. I found myself continually frustrated by my inadequate, one click of the mouse button at a time response, compared to the all encompassing AI that ran the enemy. 3 Stars.R. NicholsonP.S. As an alternative RTS World War II game, I would suggest "War Front". Although not as historically accurate as CoH, (it also had some 'what if' scenarios thrown in as well), but it at least had a set-up that allowed the 'gamer' more control over the production and deployment of his troops, buildings and armor.

A wonderful story...well told!Some potential *SPOILERS* to follow...While this book was large and daunting in size, I nonetheless found this tale, (set in mid/late 19th century Russia), fascinating and easy to read. It is the story of the rich and bored (and somewhat insecure) upper crust of Moscow's and St. Petersburg's society. The story starts off somewhat benignly but gradually becomes more involved as the characters become more exposed, showing all too common human frailties and weaknesses. The primary tale is one of an intense, emotional relationship (involving three people), while the secondary story deals with another man's own set of vulnerabilities and shortcomings as he struggles to find himself within the confines of his personal life, his work and his place in society.Tolstoy, because of this writing skills, has the ability to make his characters come alive and become indelibly etched in the readers' psyche (in mine at least), and even more impressive is the fact, that little appears to have been lost by the effects of translation. I found myself (even without the book) frequently reflecting on the ever changing relationships between main characters (Anna, her lover Vronsky and her husband Alexie on one hand and Levin, Kitty, Stepan, and Dolly on the other).The only area of this book that I found a little slow was some Tolstoy's philosophical musings (through Levin) towards the end of the novel; however the overall quality of the entire book easily puts it into the "classic" category. 5 Stars.P.S. Kudos to both Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky for their incredible translation of this startling work; it's hard to believe that so much of the emotional quality of the original manuscript was retained (and with such easy readability), through this process.R. Nicholson

'Serata Italiana' is a CD featuring tenor Michael Schade and baritone Russell Braun with the Canadian Opera Company Orchestra under the baton of conductor Richard Bradshaw. It is, as one might guess from the title, a sampling of arias and duets from four of the world's most famous Italian opera composers; that being Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi.The music that was picked for this recital was well chosen; it seems to fit the style and voice strengths of both performers. I particularly liked Braun's tongue in cheek rendition of Rossini's 'Largo al factotum' from the "Barbiere di Siviglia" and Schade's sensitive interpretation of Donizetti's 'Una furtiva lagrima' from "L'elisir D'Amore". In addition there were many other extremely well done pieces.The CD gives us a nice sampler of well know arias and duets; it would serve either as a good introduction to opera for someone wanting to 'try' opera out (as it features fairly well know works with pleasant melodies), or it would also be appropriate for a seasoned listener who just wanted to enjoy some old standards by the 'masters'.Conclusion:A CD of Italian composers; it features two male singers who have the voices and the talent to make this a pleasurable listening experience.5 Stars.

Two beautifully recorded CDs!The fact that Mahler and Walter were close associates, probably had a significant influence on these recording. I seems that Walter must have obtained some insight as to the "artistic intentions" for these pieces because they have a special quality that many other recordings of these works seem to lack; a subtleness, a quiet self-assurance if you will.My favorite:...Symphony # 1I've always been drawn to the "Titan" from the very first time I heard those eerie opening bars years ago. It always reminded me of stepping out into an alien (but not necessarily unfriendly) landscape.All in all, Mahler as I'm sure Mahler would have intended. Recommended!

"Madouc" is the third book in 'Lyonesse' trilogy by author Jack Vance. This novel is 426 pages in length and the Kindle e-edition is a 809 Kb download.I decided to purchase all 3 books in this series at one time. And to be honest, it's the only reason I finished this series. I was thoroughly disappointed with the first two books in the series but hoped that the 3rd book might be better...it was the worst of the lot.Basically, the first 90% of this story follows the adventures of Princess Madouc and her search for her 'pedigree'; a quest that puts her in direct confrontation with her father, King Casmir. The last part of the story (once Princess Madouc's tale was finished) held more interest and resulted in me giving this book 2 Stars instead of one.And here's the crucial point, it's not the quest that's so bad, it's the story telling. Unreal characters, repetitious and inane conversations, questionable decision making that put people unnecessarily in harms way, contrived situations, and problems/stories that are suddenly 'solved' with little or no explanations. In summary a myriad of techniques that made for a poorly written book.Impressions:The book reminded me of 'Camelot' meets 'Pride and Prejudice" but with the writing geared for a young adult audience. In addition, there was a smattering of fantasy (magic, wizards, faeries, trolls etc) thrown in, that at times was reminiscent of a child's faerie tale.Maps:Three maps, but unfortunately, many names and places mentioned in this tale were nowhere to be found on any of these maps.I've reviewed the ratings for this book and the ones preceding it and I believe I'm only one of a few reviewers to give less than 5 stars to them all. What did they see in the writing of this tale that I missed? I can understand any book having a chapter or two that my not have attained the higher standards of the book as a whole...but the entire book, the entire trilogy?Conclusion:A preteen/young adult may like this work.Ultimately uninteresting to read and a struggle to finish; skimming became almost a necessity. I could have stopped anytime without a single regret. 2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

I love this DVD!Performed in Los Angeles in 1994 and of course features Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. Zubin Metha conducts the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The camera angles are well placed, the switching is done appropriately and the editing has resulted in a beautiful production.What I liked about the overall performance was the obvious magical chemistry that seemed to bind the performers, orchestra and audience from the very beginning. Early on, the singers must have gotten the unmistakable feeling of having the audience in the palm of their hands.On an individual basis the whole night featured one great performance after the other: each tenor got to show off his unique voice and talent. One got the distinct feeling that a competitive atmosphere started to develop as the tenors seemed to try to outdo one another with each successive piece of music. The result was nothing short of a spectacular evening of entertainment. Who won "the battle of the Tenors" is a purely subjective matter: but I have my own winner (which I'll keep to myself)It appeared that the best time was had by the conductor Zubin Mehta: how could you not be enjoying yourself conducting a world renown orchestra and three of the worlds greatest opera singers before an enthusiastic and receptive audience. What more would it take to make one happy? Precious little I think!All and all, a must have DVD for any opera fan. This concert will be remembered for a long time to come and deservedly so.

"The People of the Mist" is a novel by Henry Rider Haggard that was first published in 1894. It is now classified as a public domain work and is available free via Kindle download. The book is 248 pages in length.*GENERAL THEME SPOILER*This story begins in England and tells of two brothers who have just found out that their recently dead father has lost the family fortune, and they are now, basically destitute. They make a pack between them to leave England and not return until they've become rich enough to reacquire the family estate. What ensues is a trek into the heart of Africa in search of gold and precious gems, but instead of a quick and easy payday the two brothers struggle to eke out an existence. One brother, Tom, falls ill and dies leaving his brother Leonard on his own, with only his man-servant Otter as a companion. The rest of the tale is a series of breathtaking adventures that require our heroes to use all their wits and resources just to stay alive, sometimes against staggering odds.*END SOILER*This book has a definitive 19th century flavor...a writing style which most readers will recognize from books by Dickens or Thomas Hardy. My only complaints (minor) would be that most of the time our adventurers had an unusual (almost uncanny) amount of good luck...when things looked bleakest, something would occur or someone would appear that would help salvage a rather tricky situation. Also, each chapter of the book was given a title and unfortunately this title usually gave away the main action or event that was about to occur in the ensuing section...this technique had a significant spoiler effect.Conclusion:A thoroughly enjoyable 19th century adventure featuring almost non-stop action. A story of unbelievable daring-do that will keep you interested from start to finish. A solid 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

This novel had an intriguing cover and the glowing reviews on the back and inside front covers had me eager to get home and dive into this offering by Paulo Coelho.However the result was a resounding disappointment...let me explain1.)The Introduction;Red flags began waving when I read the introduction of this book with the author statinga.) that he saw photographs of both President Bill Clinton and actress Julia Roberts, showing them reading this book andb.) that he, (the author) could not really understand why this book sold 20 million copies world wide.Somehow, tooting one's own horn and a hint of phony self depreciation in the introduction has a way of getting things started off on the wrong foot.2.)The Story:This is a touchy-feely-warm-and-fuzzy-all-over novel. If life enhancing, moralistic novels are your thing, you may really like this work. This book was just not what I'd expected.3.)The intended audience;The writing is really at an adolescent level. I could imagine this novel being picked out to be read for a youth-camp discussion group as there are some values here that might be useful to the younger reader, however, I would think that most adults would be far beyond the elementary teachings of this book. I guess this is why I find it hard to understand the reasons that many other readers can justify giving it 5 stars (or even 4 stars for that matter). Maybe something was lost in the translation, however, I cannot help but stop to wonder how these readers would rate a truly great book...if in fact they'd ever recognize one.This story was not what I'd hoping or looking for; undoubtedly many people will find this book engaging and a joy to read. However, I must agree with the authors statement in the intro... I find it hard to believe this effort has actually sold 20 million copies. 1 1/2 - 2 Stars.

An good sci-fi space adventure.I picked up this book after a reviewer had mentioned this work in his review of another book; I'd been a avid fan of the fantasy genre for as long as I can remember and this book provided an enjoyable excursion into something a little different.This story is a classic confrontation of good verses evil in space; a tale of suspense, betrayal, and the unexpected. All the action/events take place concurrently in a space 'lab' and on an unique planet that orbits a dormant sun; a sun that only 'fires up' for about 40 out of every 200 years. Appropriately, this sun is call the 'On/Off Star.Overall, Vinge is an excellent story teller; he makes most of his chapters [with some exceptions, see 2.) below] just long enough to tell what has to be told and then proceeds on to the next event/topic. I found he was able to create real tension (to whet your appetite, as it were) within a given scene with comparative ease, leaving the reader eager to get back to that 'area of interest' once the chapter had ended.My concerns;1.)the bizarre alien culture encountered, had too many 'human' traits; to me this seemed just a bit unrealistic and I felt took away from some of the believability of the entire novel. Yes, I know, it's just make-believe sci-fi, but to me if a story has a concept that is improbable (as this was, IMHO), within the context of the tale, it tends to take away from the entire novel.2.)A couple of areas were somewhat slow and draggy (even to the point of considering skimming them), and seemed to add little to the overall tale, other than lengthening the story.Conclusion:Despite my concerns, an altogether enjoyable Sci-fi read; some great action, unexpected events and a story with great pace (well, mostly) and timing. Some areas could have been shorten, however...3 1/2 Stars

An impressive hair clipper in every sense.I purchased this cutter (for home use) after some discussion with a person who had some experience with 'Wahl' hair cutting products; I was not disappointed with my decision.The unit comes with a clip guard, blade oil, a comb and six different cutting guides (ranging from 1/8 to 1 inch). This is a corded unit and requires a wall outlet that will accept one normal width and one wide prong plug.The pros:1.)This clipper has a heavy, secure feeling in your hand; it really feels solid and well made.2.)The cutting guides give a nice solid 'click' when applied to the blades, giving the impression that they are securely on.3.)Noise was not an issue for me (as opposed to the person who reviewed this product before me). I felt the unit produced a substantial, but not terribly annoying, hum.4.But most importantly, this unit gave a smooth, even cut; plus, there was no pulling of hair despite my attempts to push the blades through my hair fairly fast (to see how well it would perform when used quickly). The blades cut my hair without the slightest hesitation, nor was there any sense of laboring from the motor itself.Conclusion:An excellent hair cutting product for either professional or home use. It is reasonably priced and to date, has matched, if not exceeded my expectations. 5 Stars.

An interesting novel.I picked up this book really by chance at one of the local book stores; the cover really intrigued me. Several good reviews on the inside made me decide to purchase this little work by Iain Pears. I'm very glad I did.This is a story about vengeance and it involves storytelling with a difference. The entire book (all 211 pages of it) is composed of a single monologue by the narrator of the story, (an artist [painter] by the name of Henry MacAlpine). There is not a single direct comment (although there are some quotes) from another personage within the frame work of this tale. This technique works very well in this particular story as MacAlpine proceeds to lay bare his soul, with introspective thoughts on his mediocrity and his flagrant shortcomings (both as a painter and a human being), while all the time, plotting against his prey.Reading this book is akin to peeling an onion; each layer removed gets you closer to the heart of the matter; the problem being, that as you get closer to the center, one begins to have an uneasy feeling the that "heart" might just be quite rotten.This was a story that captivated me from the beginning, with its unique locale and its eerie atmosphere. Although I sensed the "type" of conclusion to come, the last 10-12 pages totally caught me off guard. There are not many tales that I go back and reread certain passages (to see if I missed the obvious), but I did, on several occasions with this book.A great story; beautifully told with pace, timing and atmosphere. Highly recommended! 5 Stars (more if I could)

This is Pearl S. Buck's stunning Pulitzer prize winning novel, 'The Good Earth'; it was written in 1931.The book itself is easy to read, written in plain language using simple words to describe people, places and things. No dictionary or thesaurus needed here.This is not only the story of Wang Lung and his wife O-lan (by arranged marriage), but also in a sense, a historical novel that gives the reader a glimpse of early 20th century, rural China. The tale follows Wang Lung life that starts from the humblest of beginnings; to later, when the winds of revolution started to bring a subtle but steady changes to his way of life as he knew it, with some unexpected effects.While reading this book, I could not help but feel that this story could be transposed to any poor rural area almost anywhere in the world; its theme has a universal chord to it.Conclusion:A beautiful story of a changing China and its people.Highly recommended.5 StarsR.Nicholson

After a long break, the highly anticipated 2nd volume to the Eragon series has finally arrived. This story is broken into two parts; one follows Roran (Eragon's cousin) and his flight from Carvahall, and the other tale, as you might guess, is about Eragon. Was it worth the wait? Well yes and no... let me explain.The pros-There is a good map and also(to refresh your memory) a short synopsis of what has transpired in the first novel.-The writing is well done, with vivid descriptions of persons, places and things; also character development is also well executed, giving us some insight into some of the other significant people in the novel.-There were some very suspenseful moments in Roran's story making it hard to put down.The cons (spoiler)-Well, to the negative...to be honest with you I was extremely bored with Eragon's tale. I had this increasingly uncomfortable feeling about this section after the first 100 pages or so. It became obvious that this entire part of the novel was going to be about Eragon's trip to the elves for training, and little else. Other than an occasional conflict of personalities, absolutely nothing happens until the very end. An ambush, a raid, a side trip to some dark foreboding place would have been so easy to include here and done so much to relieve the monotony of this long, virtually uneventful tale.All in all a good effort, but it misses the mark of greatness. A little more action (which the author is very capable of delivering, as witnessed by some of his battle scenes) would have turned this sleeper into a runaway fantasy milestone. 3 1/2 stars.

Another great adventure/fantasy read by Paul Kearney; in fact, I liked it a little more that book 1.The book is well written, has a sense of pace and timing and is absolutely crammed with action, both on the land and sea. But be aware, the writing at times can be very graphic; there are some descriptions of the battle casualties that are not for the faint of heart.As with most good fantasy tales there are elements of love, deceit, betrayal, unexpected friendships and a degree of magic; and this story is no exception. I especially liked Rol's character; this guy is no knight in shining armor and has his share of despicable traits, but he is the "hero" of these stories and there is something about him that gains my grudging admiration.The only minor negatives about this book are that1.)it's too short (317 pages to be exact)2.)although there is a map, it is not particularly detailed (at the times it needed to be).It's amazing how quickly you can read a book you like; the pages just seem to fly by. I was sorry to see this captivating tale come to such a quick end; now I can hardly wait for book III. 5 Stars.

This is a well-written, true story based on the memories of a war torn childhood.What horror it must have been to have been a German family (in this case a mother and son) and stuck in Germany at the end of WWII and even worse luck to be stuck in the Soviet Zone. The book is an account of one family's determination to survive: Survival that depended on the ability to learn how to quickly adapt to the constant changes of circumstance and the willingness to undergo individual sacrifices. In short, to do what ever was necessary to live one more day, over and over again.A compelling work: hard to put down. Highly recommended!

Fantasy literature is my favorite genre; has been for many years. So when I finally got around to reading this book, after perusing some of the 5 star reviews (many of which stated that this book, although intended for the 9-12 age group, would be enjoyed by adult fantasy readers), I was very much looking forward to a great fantasy/adventure.This is the tale of a young boy (Bastian) and a quest that takes him into the fantasy world of a book that he is reading.It is a story that is generally well written, but despite having some good qualities, I just could not get into the 'flow' of this story. Though the quest was indeed a noble one that does have some dramatic and touching moments, I found the writing was somehow geared for a definitively younger audience than myself.I've cut my fantasy teeth on Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings', Asimov's 'Foundation', George R.R. Martin's 'Ice and Fire' series, Erikson's 'Malazan' saga, also the likes of Bakker, Abercrombie and J.V.Jones, just to mention a few. These aforementioned authors tend to pull no punches when it comes to gory battles, horrific acts and clandestine plotting etc. and I must admit that these are the type of tales to which I've become addicted.'The Neverending Story' was OK-ish, however, it was tame, too tame for my tastes. It lacked for me that subtle excitement, that propensity for the unexpected that my favorite fantasy books just seem to exude almost from page one. I hesitantly admit that I found myself actually skimming some parts (not a good sign) because I was bored and uninterested in what was happening to the characters within this tale.Conclusion:A fantasy story with qualities reminiscent of a faerie tale; meant I believe, for the kinder, gentler and probably younger, fantasy lover. If your looking for battles, deceit and treachery, the chilling unexpected etc. then look elsewhere. In all honesty, this is one of those books that I have difficulty understanding the apparent adult popularity it has achieved. Also somewhat difficult to rate. And while I can understand a 5 star rating if you loved this book, but to me...1 1/2 to 2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A decent read!It seems I waited forever for this 2nd book by Charles Frasier, (the first being the well acclaimed "Cold Mountain"), and now that I've read it, I must admit to some disappointment.As with the first book, the main locale (fictional) is in the Appalachian area, somewhere in the western North Carolina/Tennessee region; the time frame is in the 19th century. The book is a running autobiography by the main character, Will Cooper, as he remembers his life long association with the Cherokee Indians and his dealings with the U.S. government.The book was generally well written and had a few parts that were extremely well done, (where you'd be hard pressed to put the book down at the given moment). On the negative side however, I felt that there were some areas that seemed to be dragged out, while some other sections had events that I found were just not believable (even in the context of fiction). Both of these deficiencies took away from the overall enjoyment I had hoped for in this novel.All in all a good second book, but it pales in comparison with the depth, tension and story quality of its predecessor. 3 Stars.

This is a thought provoking, yet disturbing, work: concerning itself with the cause, effect and future implications surrounding 9/11.Thomas Friedman is the foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times and this book, Longitudes and Attitudes, is a compilation of his works written for this paper between Dec./00 and July /02.The subject matter is broken down into two time periods, before 9/11 and after. Also included is a diary he kept during his travels to Europe and the Middle East, also between Dec./00 and July 02.The columns themselves, can be divided into three general categories 1.) The Palestine/ Israel conflict 2.) Arab/Muslim concerns, especially with regards to government and education, and 3.) American foreign affairs policies (management and mismanagement). Whether you agree or not with Mr. Friedman's thoughts is a personal matter, but the issues he raises are certainly not only thought provoking (because they have such far reaching, world wide implications) but yet, at the same time, disturbing, because the problems seem to be increasing exponentially (instead of receding) and any attempt at a solution seems to be light years away. I don't think I've read anyone who has been able to describe and dissect the events that lead up to and have occurred since 9/11 as well as Mr. Friedman. The author also puts forward some of his own ideas as to some potential solutions (or a least places to start) for some of these most troubling of issues.The only quibble I would have with regards to this book is that some of the material is repetitious. This is not so apparent if you read his column in the newspaper on a twice-weekly basis but becomes more obvious when you read a collection of these vignettes in a sitting.Finally, I must compliment Mr. Friedman's abilities as a writer: I was concerned when I considered purchasing this book, knowing it was basically a collection of his columns, that the articles would be hindered by the "pressure of deadline" and the "pressure of length". Writing columns twice a week must be a tremendous burden; to do this week after week must be extremely difficult on those occasions when you are fatigued, come up "dry" or have an episode of writer's block. Similarly writing a column 740 words long must also be hard: sometimes having to condense a long article and other times adding "fill" to make up the required length. However, I had little reason for concern, as most compositions seem to flow naturally and fit perfectly into an easy reading cadence that seemed of appropriate length.Highly recommended for anyone interested in the events surrounding 9/11, Middle East politics or U.S. foreign affair in this area of the world.

An interesting pseudo-culinary book.I must begin by stating that I love to cook and any book, video, program etc. that involves cooking tweaks my interest; and so I approached this book by Herve This (pronounced 'Teess') with great anticipation.This translated book (and I felt that there may have been a little something lost in the translation) has 101 chapters on various culinary topics; each chapter being no more that 2 - 2 1/2 pages long. Also there is an excellent glossary, index and a list of 'further reading' listed in the back.I'd been hoping for some advice on French cooking techniques that I could learn and apply to my kitchen skills. And although this book did have some interesting topics and some good suggestions, the advanced cooking tips I'd hoped for turned out to be more generalities than specific instructions.Rather than discussing how to make a dish, the author goes into great detail as to why certain things happen with certain combinations of ingredients. Initially this sounded exactly what I'd hoped for, but I quickly realized that most of the chapters involved going over cooking experiments and chemical reactions between compounds. In short, this work reminded me more at times of a PhD thesis than an actual cookbook; I felt the finding discussed here would be of more interest to a chemistry major than a chef.Conclusions:This is a well written, translated book that ended up an interesting read but not really what I'd being looking for when I decided to purchase this work. I felt that, although the discussions produced in the chapters were relevant to cooking, they were just not really practical for applying to home based culinary usage.If I'm somewhat disappointed in this book I've no one to blame other than myself; after all, the book jacket clearly states "Exploring the Science of Flavor". Plus, I should have read the other reviews more closely.

This amazing story (epic) finally comes to an end; and what an fabulous last book it was!To me, this book was one of the most difficult in the entire series to put down. It had everything; great battles (large and small), mysterious places and circumstance, devious twists and turns and some unforgettable characters and creatures. There was even a few moments of quiet sadness and heartfelt tenderness that balanced some of the chaos that seemed the norm for the ka-tet of Roland and company.Some reviewers disliked the Coda, but one really has to allow Mr. King some artistic license to end his story the way he wishes. However, I thought this addendum was the perfect todash nightmare.All in all a great finale. Bravo!!!

Cateye CC-VL810 Velo 8-Function Bicycle Computer by Cateye. It comes in silver and black and is available at most bike shops for around $20.00.The Velo 8 is a wired unit, so a wire connects the sensor on the front strut to the read-out device that snaps into the cradle that is attached to the handle bars.Some thoughts on the Velo 8 wired odometer...The Pros:1.) small in size... but big enough to easily see the LCD read-outs2.) the eight functions that can be accessed by toggling the central button on the read-out device. They are...a.) speed (in Km/h or MPH)b.) the time spent actually biking (the time stops when the bike stops moving and resumes once movement is detected)c.) average speedd.) maximum speede.) approx. calories burntf.) distance of your present rideg.) total distance of all ridesh.) time (in either 12 or 24 hr clock)3.) the read-out device is snap-in: snap-out, making it easy to put on your bike or remove if your bike is left unattended.4.) easy to reset the values on the device to zero by pressing the button for 2 seconds.The Cons:1.a) instructions are in many different languages, making for compact, small printing and somewhat difficult to read.1.b) instructions for setting up the sensor device on the spoke and the wheel strut can be confusing if your not familiar with these type of devices.2.) no specific turn OFF button. Meaning the device is always on, although it goes into 'sleep' mode to conserve batteries when idle.The only way to turn it completely off would be to remove the battery.Conclusion:For the price, a unit that will appeal to a lot of casual bikers.An eight function odometer that takes some care in setting up, but once properly installed is easy to use with its prominent toggle button. Also the ease of snap in: snap out to the handle bar cradle is a real convenience.An OFF-ON button would have been nice for extending battery life.4 1/2 StarsRay Nicholsonraynicholsonsreviews@hotmail.com

A stunning disc: both the visual and audio!This DVD is was produced in 2003 in Cortona in the province of Tuscany, Italy and features Andre Rieu and his orchestra. It is performed at an outdoor stadium with a live audience. The music selection is superb, the costumes sumptuous (see the women in the orchestra) and the musicians are first class. The camera work and editing simply make this DVD a cut above: you see film not only of the musicians but also candid shots of the audience; men, women, children and couples all enraptured by the effects of the extraordinary music they are hearing. There are even some shots of the magnificent countryside that are just stunning.There are many selections that I loved...I'll mention a few_The William Tell Overture, played with zest and pace.-The Italian National Anthem; I never realized this was such beautiful and inspiring work-The Opera Potpourri was dazzling; all the classics, including excerpts from "Rigoletto", "La Traviata", "Carmen", "Aida" and others.Highlight of the disc:The me, the best cut on this disc was Puccini's "O mio babbino caro" (sung exquisitely and with great theatre by Carmen Monarcha). It is said that when Puccini was asked what he want his music to do, he replied " to make people cry". Well, if this quiet, heartfelt masterpiece doesn't make your eyes moist, nothing will; Several of the audiences' certainly were (as were mine).The disc includes some extras, including some material on Andre Rieu himself, and then on the making of this Tuscany DVD (which shows the enormous amount of manpower it takes to assemble and the disassemble one of these shows). There is also a time lapse sequence that gives a rapid viewing of the assembly/disassembly process that is really interesting. However, all these "extras" would not make a great DVD if the music was not truly outstanding.Someone in the audience hold up a sign that says "Musica Bella": and this entire disc really is, Beautiful Music. Highly recommended!

Simply a magnificent book!I could hardly wait for this work come out and when it did, I was not disappointed. It's classic de Berniere; with the first part of the book dealing with character introduction and development. Then the second half telling how a series of wars in the early 1900's changes their lives forever; upsetting a previously workable coexistence between Greeks and Turks in the Balkan region (and within these two nationalities, Muslims and Christians).There are some very graphic depictions of the horrors of war, yet the quality of the story telling just makes you get through these tough sections and keep those pages turning. This is a difficult book to put down once you get into the main story.On the other side there are some moments of compelling sadness and of heart rendering kindness that leaves you with a lump in your throat and your eyes moist. Moments that simply make you stop reading, let the book fall to your lap and just makes you reflect on what you have just read.Story telling at its best! Highly recommended.

'The Light Fantastic' is a new offering (I stand corrected, a re-issue) of the 'Discworld' novels by Terry Prachett.This is a fun, fantasy novel, featuring an unlikely hero by the name of Rincewind (who just happens to be a wizard, and a rather incompetent one at that). This book also 'stars' a character by the name of Twoflower (tourist and travelling companion to Rincewind) and the Luggage which is aptly named because 'it' is just that...luggage, but with a personified taste for adventure and also packing a bite (as well as many other surprises).The writing is simple; the story totally unbelievable (yes, even unbelievable for fantasy). It abounds in off the cuff remarks and distinct sense of humor that could only be British. There were many laugh out loud moments in this short novel.Conclusion. A short, fun read that makes for a wonderful diversion from some potentially more serious material that I/you may be reading.A well deserved 5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.Thanks to D. Blankenship (a good amazon friend) whose review tweaked me to this most interesting and entertaining book.

A fabulous followup to the first two books in this series!The story deals with the ongoing adventures of Alucius in his struggles to save his homeland. This book follows the same pattern of the previous two, with short chapters, lots of action; all done with great storytelling skills. You just have to read one more chapter!I initially thought that this series was to be a trilogy*, but apparently there is a 4th and 5th book to come(according to the book legend in the front of this book).In my opinion, this book is the best of the three so far, and I'm looking forward to the next in the series.* P.S.The fourth book "Alector's Choice" uses a completely new set of characters and although taking place on Corus, occurs in a time far before Alucius's story.

A truly wonderful rendition of Verdi's tragic opera.This presentation is from the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden with conductor Carlo Rizzi and is performed before a live audience. The stars of this opera are Jose Cura (Manrico), Dmitri Hvorostovsky (Count di Luna), Yvonne Naef (Azucena) and Veronica Villarroel (Leonora).The casting...superb; the acting is committed and as passionate as anyone could wish for in this dramatic work by Verdi. The voice qualities are superior for all the principals, with the characters of Hvorostovsky and Villarroel leading the way.The loss of one star (really 1/2 star if it was available) in my rating was as a result of a few things that niggled me during the performance ... for instance-The sets, although well done, (and undoubtedly a lot of time and effort went into their construction) were cold and grim in their appearance: then add to this, the effect of the darkness of nighttime scenes and you had an opera where it seemed impossible to find a ray of brightness throughout the entire work.-The only subtitled language on the DVD is English. It would have been nice to at least to have the option of following the opera in Italian.-And finally (and a really picky point here) but one I feel obliged to mention because once I noticed this, I just could not get the idea out of my mind: that being, the officers costume worn by Count di Luna reminded me of something that would be seen on the doorman of a fancy New York hotel. I'm sorry, but I just had to get that out.All in all a solid Il Trovatore. To me, there were a few minor distractions, but the great acting and singing would allow me to highly recommend this work.

I really liked this novel.This was an interesting, well paced sci-fi drama/thriller that had, the ever so slight hint of Orwell's "1984". Atwood is the consummate writer; her books (and this one is no exception) are easily readable, intriguing, and have depth of story. I thought the main character of this novel was well developed, interesting and had some personality (easy to like or dislike, depending of your point of view). I found myself reading late into the night with this book..."I'll just read a few more paragraphs or one more chapter", and on I'd go.And this...kudos to Ms Atwood; she is one of the few female writers that can take a male character and make me believe that his thoughts, actions, personality traits and quirks, and above all, his preoccupation with sexual ideations, were really how a male would think. Almost every other female author (when writing from a male perspective) would always say or write something in such a way that I end up thinking, "hmmm...only a female author would say that's the way a male character would think or handle a given situation". (no offense meant to other female writers, it's just that men and women think differently) Well done Margaret!A wonderful, page turning story, albeit it a pessimistic view of the future. (SPOILER) If any negative, it would be the somewhat inconclusive ending. 4 1/2 Stars

A wonderful DVD recorded in 1991This is a live presentation at the Met of Donizetti's L'elisir d'Amore with James Levine conducting. It stars Kathleen Battle (Adina), Luciano Pavarotti (Nemorino), Jaun Pons (Belcore) and Enzo Dara (Dottore Dulcamara).This recording has so much going for it... Let me elaborate.The sets and props were outstanding with magnificent drop down scenery and even a revolving waterwheel. All the costumes (especially the ladies)were gorgeous, simply sumptuous. The camera work was generally well done with only a little concern in some of the duets. (in "Quanto Amore" for example, the camera tended on several occasions, to focus on only one of the singers when in fact both persons were singing)What really separates this L'elisir for some of the others is the quality of the singing and acting; Battle, plays the perfect Adina,(coquettish and funny)then add to this the pureness to her voice, and her ability to reach some of those high notes with such apparent ease. Pons does the best Belcore I've seen or heard, and Dara does a wonderful interpretation of the charlatan buffa, Dottore Dulcamara.However, to me, it is Pavarotti who shines throughout this night as the lovesick and downtrodden Nemorino. This is without a doubt, Pavarotti's finest acting achievement; he seemed so at ease with his character during the entire performance. And, of course, there is his voice, which was in magnificent form for this performance.Highlight of the disc:If there was one memorable, focal point in this night of outstanding performances it was Pavarotti's aria "Una Furtiva Lagrima"; sung with such tenderness and feeling that the enraptured audience ACTUALLY WAITED until the music finished before the thunderous applause and cheering started, so great was their respect for the mans rendering of this famous piece.The entire performance that night seemed to be incredibly relaxed, with the cast seemly having a lot of fun on stage. Some of the camera work actually caught some of them laughing and joking with each other after their songs. The audience giving prolonged thunderous applause and ovations after nearly every song (and deservedly so,in my opinion). What at thrill it must have been to be there that night.All in all a fabulous DVD. A must have, if your a fan of Donizetti, Battle, Pavarotti or any of the other performers of this wonderful opera with its catchy, infectious melodies.

This is a collection of humorist Stephen Leacock's best short works. There are 34 tales in this 339 page book; most are between 4 to 10 pages long, with the longest being 31 pages. The topics included in this small book vary widely and are in no particular order either chronologically or by subject.Stephen Leacock was born in Swanmore Eng. in 1869 and lived nearly all of his life in Canada, dying in Toronto in 1944. In his career he won several awards; the Lorne Pierce Medal and the prestigious Governor General's Award. He had the Leacock Medal for Humour established in his name and even had a Canadian postage stamp issued in his honour.Despite all the good things said about this book and its author, I must admit that I have a concern; the concern being that I didn't really find these stories that funny. Yes, an occasional smile or smirk, but certainly nothing that made me laugh out loud or have tears streaming down my cheeks. On reflection, I began to wonder if my lack of response is a sign of the times we live in; that I somehow misinterpreted what was considered SO funny back at turn of the last century, as being somewhat, well...silly. Humor (or at least it's interpretation) seems to have changed in the past 100 years or so.I realize that Leacock fans (who probably number in the thousands) will come down hard on me for this review, but I'm simply reporting honestly how this work affected me.Ray Nicholson

A great CD.To me, the first movement of the Mendelssohn violin concerto is one of the most perfectly structured pieces of music that has ever been written: then couple that with the haunting "Russian" theme and you have music that is both emotionally moving and gratifying. It just gets into your subconscious and affects your inner being.Hahn's playing was absolutely wonderful: her notes crisp and clean; the interpretation flawless.The lost of one star (actually star, if it was available) was because of my concern with the audio volume of the orchestra; I found the principal violin occasionally (not often, but enough to be noticeable) drowned out by orchestra. At times the orchestra sounded almost blaring; just enough of a stigma to make this less than an absolutely perfect recording.The other offering on this disc is a work by Shostakovich; a piece I'm not particularly familiar with, nor as pleasing to my ear as the Mendelssohn. The work is technically difficult but Hahn plays it with style and polish.All in all, a CD with 2 violin concertos that is worthy of adding to your classical collection.

A terrific 5th!This is the best rendition of Beethoven's 5th Symphony I've ever heard. It has a continuous pace and energy that I've seldom heard when listening to this piece before.Beethoven's 5th has often described as "fate knocking at the door". Well Kleiber's interpretation still has fate knocking at the door, but urgently... very urgently, and with the utmost positive effect. (I somehow envision the musicians lathered in sweat and collapsing from fatigue at the end of this piece).This disc also has Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it too is very well done and, on any other CD, would be the focal point of attention.A great CD; one to be considered in anyone's collection of classical music.5 Stars.R.

Nabucco, one of Verdi's earlier operas that he completed in 1842, was the work that launched his career. The choral gem, 'Va pensiero', quickly became the unofficial national anthem for the Italians whose country was under duress from its neighbors at the time.This performance stars Renato Bruson as Nabucco, Ghena Dimitrova as Abigaille, Paata Buchuladze as Zaccaria and Raquel Pierotti as Fenena; it is performed at the La Scala in Milan. The conductor is Riccardo Muti, whose animated performance during the overture was, to me, one of the highlights of this DVD. The video and editing was done expertly by Brian Large, whose deftness in this area (not only in this recording but others I've seen as well) seems to allow him to consistently get the best vantage points and camera angles.The scenery is elaborate in its structure, with some surreal qualities that at times, I found a little out of context. The costumes of the principals and corps de opera were generally resplendent in quiet flat tone robes and gowns befitting the circumstances and occasion. The exception here were the two female leads(Abigaille and Fenena) whose attire could best be described as unbecoming (honestly, bordering on ugly)The performances are sincere and powerful; the voices well controlled and vibrant. This Nabucco adequately interprets the era it tries to represent with all its religious plotting and power struggles. The audience received this production with enthusiastic applause and cheers (as it truly deserved).The disc allows you to go directly to any scene you like and the subtitles are available in five different languages including Italian. Bravo!All in all, a superb and wonderful recording. Highly recommended.

"Sophie's Choice" is work of fiction by author William Styron.SPOILERS throughoutIn 1947 a young and aspiring author (Stingo) has recently arrived in Brooklyn, New York (from Virginia) hoping to find work and the time to write his first novel. He finds some cheap accommodations in the Jewish neighborhood of Flarbush where he meets two people, Nathan and Sophie, whose unusual relationship is about to change him forever. As their friendship blossoms over the next few months, small snippets of information are gradually revealed about Sophie's past...a past that involves her capture, in 1943, and eventual incarceration in a concentration camp in Poland.As Sophie arrives in Auschwitz with her two children (Jan and Eva) she is confronted by a drunken medical doctor...whose job it is to separate the new arrivals into those who will die and those who are to be used for labor. Inexplicably and cruelly he gives Sophie a choice...pick one of your children to save, the other goes to the crematorium. For Sophie, a moment in time where the world, in her mind, stood still for the rest of her life.Impressions...Beautifully written, author Stryon weaves a stunning tale that slowly and gradually reveals the story of Sophie's past...her semi-privileged middle class life in prewar Poland, her struggle to barely survive during the invasion by Nazi Germany, her incarceration at Auschwitz and finally to her coming to America after the war where she meets and falls in love with Nathan.Yet despite all the horrors she has seen, it's her moment of 'choice' that haunts her every thought...her every waking moment. An instant in time so horrendous, so terrible, that all the other atrocities she has witnessed, pale in comparison... Sophie, required to pick one so that both won't be taken, chooses Jan. That moment when Eva, her daughter, clutching her one-eyed doll and her flute is taken away. Eva... crying, afraid and looking back, pleading... calling out to her mother. Sophie numb with incomprehension, shock and guilt is absolutely powerless and can do nothing more than helplessly look on. A scene where the reader begins to understand some of the reasons for her unusual behavior and her strange dependence on Nathan...a man who the readers will soon learn has his own emotional demons.There are many graphic and explicit sexual descriptions. At one point in the latter third of this book, I thought the writing was becoming quite ribald...however on reflecting on Sophie's increasingly dysfunctional state of mind, these 'situations' became, while not necessarily normal, at least more understandable...whatever it took to briefly escape the memories...whatever it took to cope.This is a densely written book, resulting in a slow read. In particular I found the first chapter, particularly tedious and ponderous, to the point that I actually gave up on this book the first time I attempted to read it. However, IF you can endure and get through that first chapter, you'll be rewarded with an extraordinary tale and possibly some of the finest writing your ever likely to come across.Conclusion:One of the finest books I've read in ages.Subject matter that is simply so poignant, a tale with revelations so devastatingly blunt and stunning that it is almost impossible to put this exquisitely written book down.Easily 5 StarsRay Nicholson

BACKGROUND:I purchased the DLink DIR-615 because I'd recently got an IPad and of course I needed Wi-Fi to use the wireless features. This particular unit was recommended by the sales staff at the retailer because they said it was fast, had a setup DVD for installation and would have no problem connecting me to the internet from anywhere in my two story house or veranda. The price was $49.99.SETUP:The installation DVD was inserted. I followed the instructions to the letter...the router indicated the configuration was complete...all lights were blinking on the router and my IPad indicated 3 Bars (the Maximum) of reception...I was all set to go...or so I thought. The problem was I couldn't connect to the internet. I made several attempts to reinstall but to no avail.THE SOLUTION: (the happy ending)The DVD and the retail box both have a 1-800 tech support phone number, available 24/7. In desperation I called it and (as I'd expected) got put on with an automated attendant. BUT to my surprise after a couple redirects to the appropriate service I was QUICKLY referred to a LIVE assistant who was kind, patient and very familiar with my concerns...He directed me to a web-site and with a few instructions had my DLink 615 up and running in a couple minutes.PERFORMANCE:In a word...PERFECT. Steady fast data streaming, no lost connections and works everywhere in my surrounding area with a full 3 Bars of signal strength.CONCLUSION:A reliable product, reasonably priced and with great Tech support! What more could you ask for. 5 StarsRay Nicholson

"The Name of the Rose " is a medieval murder mystery by author Umberto Eco. The paperback copy is 517 pages long and retails for $10.85 while the Kindle e-version is a 896 Kb download that retails for $3.28 at the time of writing this review.SPOILERSThe story is set in the 1327... William of Baskerville, a former grand inquisitor, has been called to a remote abbey in the north of Italy to investigate some rumors of heresy. However, a recent mysterious death sidetracks is original mission, and leads to many new and disturbing findings. The results are an investigation what will shake the Abbey to its very foundations and will affect nearly everyone associated with this Holy place of worship.With him is a young boy by the name of Adso, a monk in training, who also acts as his scribe. Their investigations meet obstacle after obstacle, but eventually enough information is gleaned between murders, to make our sleuths aware that the off-limits library seems to hold the answers to the ever increasing number of questions.END SPOILERSImpressions:The story, when it was able to stay on focus, was great...interesting, tense and even at times, harrowing. Dark recesses visible only by the ambient lighting from candles or oil lamps, affairs that were both secretive and illicit, clandestine meetings...all gave this book high marks for intrigue and maintaining the readers interest.But...as good as the main tale was, unfortunately there were long and drawn out segments that dealt with the religious ideology of the time. Differences in religious views that prevailed in neighboring areas of Italy, France and Germany in the early 1300s, resulted in the formation of several separate orders of Monks... each firmly entrenched into the thinking that their 'religious perceptions' were the only correct version.To illustrate some of the absurdity, two topic of great and prolonged discussion in this book were the interpretations of the 'vows of poverty' and whether Jesus ever laughed. Hard to believe that such insignificant sounding topics could dominate the religious politics of the day. And you had to be careful who you talked to, because your point of view could label you a heretic is the wrong circles.I'm not a historian, but if accurate, the detail in reciting some of the religious thinking of that era and the thousand years before it was truly impressive.Because of the rarity of books in that age (most were painstakingly copied by hand) most information of the millennium before the time of this story, was passed down by word of mouth or by fragile crumbling parchments. Not surprising then that accounts of events could change dramatically with the adding or dropping of an important word or phrase here or there. It also depended on the beliefs of the person telling these old accounts...adding a bit of personal 'color' to the history being related.Eco's book makes it perfectly clear that people of this era lived in a culture of ignorance, illiteracy, superstition and most of all, fear.In addition the book had a couple good maps at the beginning giving the layout of the Abbey, and one very informative map of the complicated series of rooms and hallways of the mysterious library.Conclusion:I loved this tale when it stayed on course with the story.The latter part of the book is somewhat different than what I remember from the movie.There is no questioning Eco's ability to write a great tale that can captivate a readers attention. That being said he also can drift off the subject at hand for prolong periods...side stories that although related to the story, have little to do with the actual substance of the plot. The number and length of these 'distractions' added significantly to the length of this book and to be honest had me skimming some of these sections.As it is...4 Stars (would have been an easy 5 if not for the 'diversions')Ray Nicholson

This is part of Herbert Von Karajan's legacy series featuring the Weiner Philharmoniker. Recorded in 1985 this DVD has a total running time of just a little over 43 minutes.First, let me state that Dvorak's 9th Symphony (From the New World) has always been one of my favorite pieces of classical music; with its pulsating opening movement, then the Largo, with its beautifully quiet "going home" theme and finishing up with a driving ending that simply leaves me breathless and in awe of this masterpiece.The audio is a very solid production of Dvorak's 9th ; my only minor complaint here would be that I found some of the horns a little blaring at times. However, I have several concerns for the video portion of this recording; (not that there was anything technically wrong with the video,) but more specifically, I felt the way it was recorded and then edited into the final product could have been better, much better... let me explain.-many of the shots of the orchestra were fairly tight closeups of groups of 4 or 5 instruments (horns, cellos or clarinets etc.). The view was from the perspective of looking down an row of musicians with their instruments; the first person was in focus but all the others becoming increasingly out of focus. (this reminded me of a line of Greek columns) This view was repeated over and over throughout the entire work. The camera for these shots (and in fact, all shots) was stationary, giving the video a regimented, detached almost lifeless look.-although the DVD was in color there was a drab, featureless quality to it; to me, it might have well have been in black and white.-there were virtually no panoramic views of the orchestra itself. The largest group one got to see was about 10 or so violins in the background (out of focus) with Von Karajan in the foreground (in focus). Again, this was a view that was prominently featured throughout the entire DVD.-and also I have a couple of "video" concern dealing with Von Karajan himself;1.) this DVD seemed to me, to be more about HVK than the piece being performed; he seemed to spend an inordinate amount of the time in the camera spotlight.2.) Von Karajan seems to conduct this energizing, exhilarating symphony with all the vigor of a man scarcely awake; arms and hands barely moving up and down while the orchestra and its rampaging music is pounding all around him. His conducting enthusiasm just did not measure up to the music being performed, and yet the "music" was as good as I could have asked for. I eventually found it was much easier to appreciate this great work by turning off the monitor and simply listening to the audio.Basically the only reason to put a product like this on DVD is for the visual affect, (the audio could be adequately handled by a CD), and the video in this case falls short. To me, this is a 5 star audio recording of Dvorak's New World Symphony, but the video limitations are significant enough to really hinder the overall enjoyment of this great piece of music. 2 1/2 stars.Addendum: Dec. 18, 2006If I had to recommend a DVD recording of Dvorak's Symphony # 9 "From the New World", it would have to be Euroart's magnificent recording, "Claudio Abbado: Europa-Konzert From Palermo" ; this DVD features the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Italy. It has wonderful audio, and as well, is superbly filmed and edited; highlighting the most appropriate individual, group or panoramic view at any given moment in the concert. It's simply 5 Star in all aspects.

I purchased these headphones last week and have listened to a lot of both classical music and opera with them; its been a rewarding experience.This unit has a full audio range while at the same time blocking out extraneous noise (however, they aren't a noise reduction unit) You have the feeling of almost like being in a sound proof room; you hear nothing but the music or ambient sounds associated with the orchestra. They were able to pick up some of the more subtle sounds that occur during a performance that you would not pick up from floor mounted speakers.The only niggling complaint I have is that even though the set is circum-aural fitting, I found that they tended to be warm on the ears after about 20-30 minutes of use.This product is expensive, but worth it, i.e. you get what you pay for; in this case, a quality product geared towards audiophiles.

An interesting, informative book.This is an account of one man's participation in the American Civil War (1861-1865). Elisha Hunt Rhodes joined the Rhode Island Volunteers in 1861 as a private and left as a colonel in 1865; having earned the respect of not only his peers but his superiors as well. The book is a diary (plus a few letters) he kept during his army life: it includes daily to weekly accounts of the people and places he got to know and see, plus the battles with which he was involved.The diary is well written (better than you'd expect from a 19-year-old in 1861). There are accounts of the marches that covered seemly unbelievable distances: wearing the men in to a state of complete exhaustion. (And often, after reaching their destination, would have to march back to where they started) There are tales of deprivation, hunger, prolonged stress, boredom and even some humorous moments as well. The descriptions of some of the carnage is told in a rather detached, matter of fact manner, (probably understandable, given the circumstances) even though he was in the midst of several of these bloody scenes and lost countless friends and colleagues.The diary was recorded chronologically and with dates: also included, is an excellent map of the area. The map even outlines the marches that the 2nd R. I. Volunteers participated in during their 4 years at war. This is a wonderful addition to this book that not only makes following the events easy but also makes you appreciate the distance that these armies traveled, mostly on foot.All in all, an interesting, personal account of the American Civil War: one that gives new insights into an era of history that has significantly shaped the United States into the country that we know today. Highly recommended!

'Three Cups of Tea' is a novel-like biography (i.e. told in story form), covering an extended period in Greg Mortenson's life. The co-author is David Oliver Relin.In Sept. 1993, Greg Mortenson has failed to climb K2 (not the highest, but arguably the hardest mountain to climb in the world) and on his descent becomes lost. He mistakenly ends up in a small primitive village called Korphe; a primitive, illiterate village that will change his life. He is enamored by the people and their seemingly inexhaustible energy to survive in this harsh way of life. He decides to do something to help their existence; he pledges to build them a school. And thus his life and his existence are about to change forever.'Three Cups of Tea' is emotionally moving at times and nerve wracking at others; all the while describing the rugged land, its incredible people, the ever present hostile terrain and the extremist combatants that live there. The book, although an account of one man perseverance and courage, also inadvertently (maybe not so inadvertently) points out, using hindsight, the obvious; so much more could have been accomplished to effectively combat terrorism in this area of the world with the use of books, hospitals and education (especially the girls).There are 2 excellent maps of the area, that will give you an idea of the geography involved. Also there as several pictures taken by Mortenson, a few of landscapes, but most are of the people of the region who he came to depend upon.Conclusion:A beautiful book, filled with wonders and courage; a tribute to one man's foresight and dedication. A lesson for all governments.5 Stars.

A good set of headphones from Sony.The ProsThis product has a full sound spectrum with realistic reproduction of classical music.The headphones cushions rest on the head instead of the ears, making the unit reasonably comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.The ConsThe price; In Canada $299.00 from the Sony storeThe unit, although not heavy, is big and clunky and because of its size tends to be moved around a bit by pillows or cushions when used while lying down on a sofa.All in all a quality sound product but pricey and somewhat cumbersome. 3 1/2 stars.

'Academs Fury' is the second book in the 'Codex Alera' series by Jim Butcher (author of the popular, 'Dresden Files' chronicles).Well, this book is an improvement on book I of the series; in which I'd complained of several ongoing, perceived 'flaws' (see my review of 'Furies of Calderon' dated Jan 03/10). The 'flaws' were about my need for fantasy to be 'believable, within the context of fantasy'. I had really thought that the author had got the 'believability factor' spot on for this book...until I reached chapter 29 and then later on at some of the battles towards to end. At chapter 29, two separate decisions occur which are just totally unrealistic (and unbelievable) within the parameters of the story, thus diminishing (at least for me) the premise for good/great fantasy. And with regards to the battles...it appears that no matter what the staggering disadvantage against them in numbers, strength and magical resources, the 'good guys' seem to be able to eke out another survival.As I continued to read on, shaking my head in mild disbelief, it finally dawned on me what exactly was the problem. Where it falls down, is in the apparent lack of consistency in the intended level of audience. Let me explain...First, let me ask this question...what is the most annoying thing for most true-blue fantasy lovers...easy answer...YA (young adult) fantasy writing with its convenient (and usually unbelievable) solutions. And herein lies the problem with this novel...it's a mixed bag...parts of both. While most parts of this book read like they were intended for 'adult' (or at least mature) lovers of fantasy literature, chapter 29 however, changes to a style that I'd have expected in a book meant for young adult readers. i.e. a convenient, easily justified, but unrealistic ideas/solutions for some ongoing problems. And although slightly different, the same technique is use to save the day in the outcomes of the major battles towards the end.It's when you encounter instances like this, even though they occupy very little time and space within the context of the entire story, they have a way of reducing the quality of the entire tale several notches.It is really too bad because you have to give Jim Butcher his due regarding this story. It has an extremely interesting tale; otherwise well written...filled with magic, intrigue, extraordinary creatures, double dealing, and some great skirmishes. In short, all the ingredients that any fantasy lovers would crave.Conclusion:Despite my concerns, I really liked this story and the series so far. And, I like Jim Butcher writing style, he's got a great imagination and has the ability to really spin a wonderful tale...but this overall adult quality fantasy is diminished somewhat by inclusion of some unlikely happenings that I'd have expected to find in a young adult level book. Mr. Butcher needs to make up his mind as to which fantasy audience he wishes to write. 3 Stars.Ray Nicholson

An enjoyable performance on DVD of Mozart's last opera in which he used Lorenzo da Ponte for the libretto.This is a 2-disc DVD set that stars Amanda Roocroft (Fiordiligi), Rosa Mannion (Dorabella), Rodney Gilfry (Guglielmo), Rainer Trost (Ferrando), Eirian James (Despina) and Claudio Nicolai (Don Alfonso).John Eliot Gardiner conducts this work that is performed before a live audience at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.The sets are simply magnificent with multiple curtains that depict beautifully painted backdrop scenes. The floor is entirely made up on plaques of inlaid stone to resemble an outdoor courtyard: a very realistic touch. The costumes are lovely and are appropriate for the era they represent. Also the cameral angles, switching and film editing are excellent and have resulted in a finished work that is of superior quality.That main singers are young, vibrant and indeed sexy: someone you could really believe to be in love and they all have great voices. They are competent in their acting skills making good use of hand gestures and facial expressions.And yet despite all the above positives things that I've mentioned above, I felt, for some difficult to explain reason, the first half of Act I dragged significantly (thus 1/2 star lost). I sensed the audience also had the same opinion, as their applause during this phase was rather subdued. However, this lack of energy changed quickly once Eirian James, as the maid, Despina, came on stage. She had an energetic stage presence that seemed to infect her fellow actors: While the other actors and actresses seem to enjoy their roles, she obviously loved hers and this shone through from beginning to end. From this point on, the entire cast seemed more at ease and appeared to be enjoying themselves on stage. The last part of Act 1 and the remainder of the work was lively, funny and a joy to watch and hear. Certainly the audience was much more responsive and their applause more sincere and prolonged.Technically, the disc has subtitles in several languages, including English and Italian, BRAVO!. However on the negative side, there is no menu that allows you to go to a particular scene: you have to start at the beginning of an Act and continue to jump forward one scene at a time(another 1/2 star lost). This is annoying and difficult to understand with the advances in todays recording standards.All in all a wonderful presentation: the negatives that I've mentioned above pale in comparison to the overall positives of this delightful work. A Cosi that I could honestly recommend to be added to anyone's opera collection.

This is a wonderful DVD, having all the best of ingredients that blend together to make a near perfect Don G.Herbert V. Karajan has done a magnificent job with the orchestrated music and the performers are top notch (acting as well as singing). I found the setting perfectly suited to the style and mood of this great work: dark, seductive and secretive. The camera angles are well placed and the audio is superb.Samuel Ramey is a perfect Don G. Unrelenting in his persuit of the fairer sex and unrepentant as well: great voice and obviously enjoys his role as the world's number one philanderer.Julia Varady is the frequently scorned and forever forgiving damsel. Her non singing part in Leporello's "Madamina" is delightful to watch.Kathleen Battle plays a coquettish Zerlina and her arias and the duet with Ramey are magnificent to behold.My favorite performance however, is by Ferruccio Fulanetto as the roguish Leporello; playing the role of a scoundrel who knows he should know better but is having too much fun to stop.One final point: I liked the menu on this DVD. Giving you the option to play the entire concert or go to a particular scene. Also the choice of language for the subtitles was nice as well: although I speak English only, I find that once you get used a particular opera, it really is nice to follow along the voices in the recorded language, in this case Italian. I must admit that my favorite opera language is Italian.The true measure of pleasure an opera gives me is how often I listen to my favorite sections and it comes as no surprise that I play several sections very often. It seems every time I observe something new.If you were considering getting Don Giovanni I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD. You will not be disappointed.

A disappointing read.Having exhausted the supply of my favorite fantasy writers (see list below), I came upon this effort by R.A. Salvatore and despite the lack of any reviews (superlative or otherwise) on the back and front covers I decided to give it a try anyway.The story line was not bad but I had 2 major concerns with this book.1.) All the "good guys" are squeaky clean; not a character flaw to be found among all of them put together.2.) And my chief complaint; As soon as I read a few paragraphs of the first battle scene I got this uneasy feeling about Mr. Salvatore's battle writing technique. You just could tell that no matter what the dire predicament, no matter what the staggering numbers of bad guys verses good guys, that the monsters and evil doers simply never had a chance.Don't get me wrong, I like the good guys to win as well, but a least there should be an element of doubt as to the outcome, rather them making the battles an almost foregone conclusion.In fairness to Mr. Salvatore, I believe this was one of his first efforts. However, the shortcomings mentioned above, were enough to make me not bother to read the rest of this trilogy. This book turned out to be less than satisfying. 1 1/2 Stars.P.S. If you want gut wrenching fantasy that has some unpredictability and surprises, I'd humbly suggest one of the following authors; that being S. Erikson ("Malazan Book of the Fallen"), Scott Bakker ("Prince of Nothing") or R.R. Martin's incredible "A Song of Ice and Fire" series.

I've decided in this review, to do all 3 books in the Tawny Man trilogy, (that being Fool's Errand, Golden Fool and Fool's Fate), as they are intricately connected (as you might expect) in the main characters, story line and writing quality.I enjoyed this series but with some minor reservations... let me explainThe pros:The prose and story telling is of the highest quality with detailed description of persons, places and things. There is great character development throughout the entire trilogy; people you really like (or dislike) with a passion, and as with most fantasy novels, there is some magic and characters or creatures with special talents. The plot, although slow to develop, is interesting and intriguing; it grips you, making you eager to get back to these novels whenever you can. The writing itself has a nice, easy to read flow to it and follows in a logical sequence.The cons: Two niggling concerns: (and loss of star)1.)The main character; ( Fitz) is best described as a reluctant hero with an overwhelming sense of guilt and continual self depreciation. In Fitz's opinion, everything that has ever gone wrong in this story can be traced back to the way he handled a situation in the past; and he is FOREVER agonizing about these thoughts (what he might have done different... etc.) Needless to say, three novels of this, and this character trait starts to wear a little thin.2.)Lack of action; I realize a great novel does not have to have "action", however having said that, I've always liked my fantasy novels to have a fair amount of "action" with some battles or combat (large scale or small). That is not to say this series has no action, because it does, but somehow I wanted more. The few skirmishes seemed so far apart, and I must admit this was somewhat disappointing.Although it may appear that my "concerns" mentioned above appear huge, such is not the case. This is a deep, rich fantasy series of epic proportions; well written and detailed, but just misses the mark of true greatness because of the shortcomings mentioned above. 4 stars.

This is an entertaining read."Baudolino", by Umberto Eco, is a tale of grand adventure and intrigue: the setting is in Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The story is well written and absorbing: it moves at a good pace and procedes to a definitive ending. I really looked forward to finding time to keep returning to this book.If you like Umberto Eco's style of writing then you will enjoy this book. Recommended.

"The Iron Tower" trilogy by Dennis L. McKiernan is one of my favorite fantasy reads. The three components of the trilogy are 'The Dark Tide', 'Shadow of Doom' and 'The Darkest Day'.This trilogy follows the adventures of Tuck and Danner and their companions, (characters who are members of a physically small people called 'Warrows') as they travel countless leagues to fight the source of the evil hordes that have begun invading their quiet homeland.The one criticism of this work is that some fantasy/adventure readers find it follows Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' closely; in fact, a little too closely. And this statement is, in my opinion, probably justified. However, this does not diminish the quality of the writing and the beautifully developed story found within these pages.I loved the main protagonists with the same intensity as Tolkien's Frodo and Samwise; maybe even more. Tuck and Danner have a likeable, genuine quality that draws you into this trilogy and make you read on and on; in short, I really cared for them. In addition to some great and treacherous treks, there are some huge battles, magical creatures and friends and enemies found in unexpected places.There is, for those that care about such things, an adequate map; allowing you to keep abreast of where events occurred and also maintain some sense of position and direction in the wide spread geographic area that this tale covers.Conclusion:An enthralling fantasy/adventure experience; probably McKiernan's best work. Notwithstanding the criticism of readers for its closeness to 'The Lord of the Rings', to me, it still remains a treasured read.5 StarsRay Nicholson

An excellent extension (if needed) for your indoor Sirius Satellite Radio system.I found the indoor antenna that comes with the home unit for Sirius Satellite Radio inadequate because;1). It seemed weaker (in reception) than the corresponding car antenna2a). I couldn't place it on a indoor window ledge that had the proper direction for receiving a strong signal.2b.) Exact placement on window sill is required. However, the least movement of the wire or window curtain would minutely change the position of the antenna, resulting in signal loss. Very annoying and frustrating.I eventually solved the problem by using a Sirius Car antenna (the one with the magnet) and placed it in a good outdoor spot to receive the satellite signal; the 50 foot extension allowed me to connect the outdoor antenna to my indoor Sirius radio by channeling it through a window frame. Now the satellite radio works just fine.A great product that allowed me to use my indoor Sirius radio as I had intended. 5 Stars!

This is the second book in the series featuring Butcher's protagonist, Harry Dresden; wizard, private investigator and all round good guy.In this story Harry and Murph become involved in a convoluted plot that revolves around several grizzly murders and werewolves. Bob the Skull, a virtual encyclopedia of all things regarding werewolves and lycanthropic lore (not to mention all things testosterone as well), helps Harry in his plan to investigate these unusual circumstances. The pendulum has been set in motion, and chaos and mayhem are about to reign supreme.Conclusion:If you like Jim Butcher writing, you'll like this. Fun, faced paced and has some interesting confrontations, sprinkles of humor and some erotic moments; in other words, a typical Harry Dresden novel. 5 Stars.

An excellent crossword puzzle help book; it is a compilation of Crossword definitions that have been taken from other puzzles over the past 10 years.**SEE Kindle EDITION COMMENT AT THE END OF THIS REVIEW. Jan 07, 2011What I liked...1.)It features an extensive list of words, abbreviations, acronyms, phrases, and fill in the blanks in phrases and sayings.2.)It also gives detailed information on authors (and their books), actors and actresses (listing their movies), sports and sport persons, musicians, movies with stars, directors and music and Oscars; this is, of course, in addition to a huge volume of 'normal' crossword puzzle definition and answers.3.)There are foreign countries listed (with notable persons, places and unique points of interest), as well as common words found in many foreign languages4.)Answers to definitions are listed first by word size, e.i. 3, 4, 5, letters etc. and then all these words are listed alphabetically; for example, If you looked up the word 'MEANING' you'd find: 3...aim, use; 4...gist, goal, pith; 5...drift, heart, and so on.Minor concerns:1.)The book is large (1,268 pages) and heavy, making it a significant weight to be toted around. (not unexpected, I guess, for the quantity [and quality as well] of material it holds)2.)The printing is somewhat small; most of us 'older' folks will need reading glasses to see the offered answers comfortably.Suggestions for improvements:Some shading at the side edge of the pages would have be very useful to indicate where each letter of the alphabet started; possibly using different colors may have helped even more.Conclusion:I love challenging crossword puzzles; this paperback book has provided the best help for finding most tough clues that I've come across. 5 Stars**KINDLE EDITION. In a word USELESS. The only interactive aspect of the Kindle edition of this book is the basic alphabet listings. i.e. A, B, C, etc. and with these you can go to the first page in the "A" listing, the first page of the "B" listings, and so on. This leaves you 'flipping' through page after page of definitions trying to find the one you want...very time consuming and frustrating. The letter "S" alone in the paperback book goes from page 971 to 1099...with each page contain somewhere around 80 to 100 definitions. And remember the Kindle page hold much less information because they are smaller.

A small masterpiece by Khaled Hosseini.Every once in a while I come across a book that has a character in it that thinks and acts like I would have probably thought or acted given the same situations; "The Kite Runner" is one of these novels. I suppose that is what made this book seem almost "personal" to me, and let me tell you, it was difficult to face the written word that continually exposes your human frailties and shortcomings. Be that as it may, this is still a work I cherish.It is beautifully written , moving and disturbingly graphic at times. It is difficult not be become emotionally involved in this work; I suspect this is why I found this book hard to put down.This is the story of Amir and his friend Hassan, (a middle class boy and his servant, respectively) living in Kabul, Afghanistan in the mid 1970s. The book details Amir and his struggle to find himself in his difficult, dangerous and changing world. Initially, the setting is Afghanistan prior to the Russian invasion, it then switches to the U.S.A. before returning to Kabul during the reign of the Taliban.All in all, one of my favorite books. Highly recommended. 5 Stars

A sad, painful, haunting novel by Yasmina Khadra.This is the story of 4 people who live in Kabul: A Kabul that has degenerated into an urban economic and psychological wasteland under the Taliban.Then one event changes the course of the lives of these 4 people: bringing them into contact with one another and making all of them reflect and focus not only on the past but also what is happening to their somewhat "safe" present existence.The narrative is powerful, the story is exquisitely told. It will keep you turning the pages until you reach the conclusion.Highly recommended

'Ender's Game' was written by Orson Scott Card and first published in 1977. It has won both the Nebula and Hugo Award for Science fiction novels.I picked up this book after some discussion with another amazon friend who was a great fan of this series (now at 6 books, I believe). This recommendation turn out to be a good piece of advice as I enjoyed reading this work.The tale was well thought out and superbly written; the story itself was intriguing, with enough action and interesting events to make you eager to get back to this book whenever you could.The Story...*SPOILER*This is the tale of Ender Wiggin, who we meet as a six year old boy. We then follow Ender through the next five years of his ongoing training and development; development that the authorities of the day hope will lead them find the next military leader they need to save the world from an alien invasion.One Concern...*SPOILER*The one negative I'd have (and loss of 1/2 Star) would deal with the aspect of believability (or lack thereof). Somehow taking a six year old boy (despite his high aptitude for the job) and training him to take over an intergalactic space armada seems a little (well, a lot) preposterous. Replacing the six year old with someone a bit older, would have added some credibility to this otherwise excellent story.Conclusion:Although toted to be 'Young-Adult', this book will appeal to any sci-fi fan because it is both well written and superbly presented. Maybe the believability factor could have been enhanced somewhat with an slightly older protagonist. 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

I was disappointed in this effort.OK, to be fair, it said "scholastic" on the front cover of the book and although I'd warning bells going off in my head, I figured with the glowing reports on the initial inside page, in addition to the number of great young adult fantasy coming out of late (i.e. Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, Bartimaeus etc.) that this one would be a winner. Unfortunately this is not the case... Let me explain.The pros:The book has an enticing cover, an intriguing beginning, and a very good ending; it also has a great concept in the way the book "Inkheart" was used in the story as the central force behind the plot. So far so good, however...The cons:However, the novel was decidedly disappointing throughout the middle section. The characters were frustrating; their actions and decision repeatedly bringing them into harms way that even a simpleton would have recognized and avoided. Also, I'm still trying to figure out what the real role Elinor had in this book; maybe she's intended to be a source of comic relief. Except she's not funny and again like so much of the middle portion of this book, does things that continually jeopardizes the entire group as they muddle on towards the end. Another example is "Tinkerbell" (from Peter Pan), introduced about 2/3 the way through the book, mentioned several times, but had absolutely nothing to do with any of the characters or the storyline. Strange!This book had such promise; but the weakly developed and totally forgettable main characters, (in addition to the erroneous thinking and actions on the part of our "heros"), continually left me cringing at their shortcomings.All in all, this book would appeal to the older child or young adult; anyone that is a true adult fantasy lover, would have difficulty being pleased with this effort. The pity of it all is that this book was so close to being a great fantasy read.

As good as I had hoped for (with one small caveat, mentioned below)Anyone who enjoyed the previous books in the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant should relish the opportunity to refresh old memories with this latest Donaldson work. The book begins with a short synopsis of what has taken place previously. This story line and structure remain much the same as the preceding series; with the slow build up, constant self-doubts and self-incriminations by (in this case) the heroine of the novel, and finally resolve and determination directed towards the conflict at hand.In short, I loved the novel; it got better and better as it went along and it came to the point where I found it hard to put down.And yet, (and I just have to mention this) the work has, what I feel to be a flaw: an error of grammatical license if you would... let me explain.My concern or "flaw" in this case is the word "percipience"; I noticed it many times in the first half of the book and then I started to count the number of times it appeared from page 250 until the end. A total of 23 times. Roget's thesaurus list 36 different alternatives for the word "percipience". I just find it hard to believe the author, proof readers or editors didn't pick up on this rather amateurish mistake. But then maybe it was deliberate. Who knows! In any event, it became hard not to cringe when I came upon one of the repetitious uses of this word. (Sorry, I just had to get that off my mind.)Notwithstanding, and aside from my little "rant" above, it was a great read; a fine continuation of the Thomas Covenant Chronicles and I can hardly wait for the next installment. Highly recommended for Covenant fans. 4 and 1/2 stars

"Triggerfinger" is the second episode in the second half of Season 2 of AMC networks Zombie thriller "The Walking Dead"SPOILERSThis episode picks up where the last left off, as it follows Rick, Hershel and Glen and concludes with a gunfight at the deserted tavern in the near dark. Spooky and tense on its own, but terrifying when you realize that the Zombies are never very far away. The results look to make a significant impact back at the farm. Also featured is Lori's car wreck and her harrowing tale of her escape while encountering some Zombies.END SPOILERSIn addition to the two main story lines mentioned above, this episode features a lot of raw emotion being shown between several individuals... emotions that seem sure to lead to more internal conflicts between our original survivors and the farm denizens as well.Conclusion:Again, great acting and a near perfect blend between action and drama. A story of survival... and survival means avoiding Zombies when possible and killing them when it's not. Great directing and outstanding camera work that captures those fleeting emotional nuances that come and go in a split second.A great series; a great individual episode.5 StarsRay Nicholson

"Better Angels" is episode 12 in the second season of "The Walking Dead".Some thoughts...1.) a seemingly 'slow' episode ends with an absolute blockbuster of an ending.2.) one gets the feeling that the normal way of being infected with the Zombie 'virus' as just undergone a new and sinister mutation.3.) my only concern for this show/series is that there seems to be a definitive 'soap opera' quality creeping into the events that involve our survivors. Things seem to be becoming a little more bizarre every week. This may not be necessarily a good sign.4.) great actors and great acting giving us memorable characters.Conclusion:Overall a rather slow episode (2 1/2 to 3 Stars), but with a stunning finale (5+ Stars)Aggregate rating 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

"The Walking Dead"... last nights finale for season two had some interesting moments.1.) probably the greatest number of zombies in one show for the entire second season.2.) loss of two more members of Hershel's family to the herd.3.) Rick informs the group on the details of Shane's death and also tells them some stunning news regarding the Zombie virus... news he's known but withheld from them since they left the CDC center at the end of season one.4.) a fast paced and harrowing ending... with the survivors just barely surviving and Laura being 'rescued/captured'. We are given brief glimpse at the very end as to what will probably be main locale for season three next fall.5.) overall, great acting bringing a myriad of truly interesting characters to life.6.) my only concern would be the soap opera quality of events that seem to be creeping into the latter shows.Conclusion:A great season finale and overall an incredible season two.Best moment of the year... The 'barn' finale at the mid point of the season.5 StarsRay Nicholson

"Nebraska" is the first episode in the second half of Season 2 of the AMC TV show "The Walking Dead".Another terrific episode in this outstanding series in which the survivors deal with the aftermath of the 'barn' incident, Hershel's disappearance and Laura's car drive.Impressions...Some complain about the lack of action, but this episode (and the others in Season 2) are more than just encounters with Zombies (although there are plenty of those). What makes this show so special (at least to me) is...1.) the acting...and not just by one or two. The entire cast is great.2.) the method in which the plot is slowly advanced to build a tension filled atmosphere that usually leads to one or more focal points in each episode.3.) the different personalities that make up the survivor group... a fragile mix of emotions that are liable to explode at any moment and often do.4.) new developments are brought into play just as one flash point is finally put to rest, resulting in another tense, edgy ending for this particular show. You could just feel it coming... loved it!Conclusion:A Zombie TV adventure with as good as acting and plot writing as your ever likely to encounter.5 StarsRay Nicholson

"The Walking Dead" (Season 2) is a Zombie tale in the form of an eight part mini series on the AMC network. The first show was two hours in length and was followed by seven segments that were each a hour in length.The entire second season of "The Walking Dead'" is unbelievably good. Great acting of interesting characters that have such a diversity of personalities, highlight this intriguing series. Couple the acting with a suspenseful story with life and death implications, creepy settings and the occasional unexpected attack and you have a series to keep you on the edge of your seat.I noticed some other reviewers complained that there was not enough action, or less action than in Season 1 and that may be true to a point. But this season, to me, was much better because of the emotional build-up in some of the scenes. Things that lead to some unpopular but decisive decisions making... decisions that sometimes had repercussion that were of mammoth proportions in the overall scope of this ongoing tale. I found it very easy to become totally immersed in this thrilling series.The finale ending... violent, yet stunningly heart-rendering and somehow cathartic. So far I've watched the last few minutes four separate times and oh my... the acting, the raw, visceral emotion... just gut wrenching. Hard to express in words the impact of this visual experience... best to see it yourself.I can hardly wait for the rest of Season 2.5 Stars...more if I could.Ray Nicholson

I liked this book.The writing of this fantasy is plain and simple, no complicated words or phrases: but the story is told with the skill of a master taleteller and (just as important) with an easy readability. I found myself eager to get back to it whenever I found a spare moment.I found I liked the central figure (Alucius) and his special "talent". Also, there seemed to be just the right balance of magic, suspense, love, friendship and battles to make this work a pleasure to read for any fantasy/adventure fan. Recommended!

This novel, by Edward P. Jones, won a Pulitzer prize. (and deservedly so, in my opinion).The story revolves around the interaction of a group of slaves, (some freed, most not) and slave owners in Virginia in the 1830s and 40s.Not unexpectedly, it is the quality of story telling that distinguishes this book and has made it a major prize winner. The written words seem to flow effortlessly off the page giving the reader a sensation of comfort and enjoyment with the passage of each chapter.Have you ever been able to sit in a comfy chair on the porch on a warm summer evening, watching a sunset through the remains of the days heat haze and listening to the frogs begin to chirp? Nothing to rush you, no pressing commitments, just plain contentment, well that's what reading this book reminded my of.I found a good friend in this book and hated to see it come to an end. Highly recommended.

"The Assault" is a work of fiction by Harry Mulisch. This soft cover book is 186 pages in length.Foreword:I came across this book as a result of my stumbling across an obituary in one of our local papers. It took up about 1/3 of a page and mentioned that the author was renowned for his WW II story "The Assault". Previously I'd never heard of Harry Mulisch or this tale. However, because of the high praise mentioned for the book in the obit. plus the fact that I've always had an interest in events concerning WW II, I decided to get this book...a very rewarding decision.*SPOILER*It's Holland, January 1945...remembered as the 'winter of starvation' for reasons most of us can guess, but little appreciate. As the war is winding down in the still occupied town of Haarlem, a hated Nazi collaborator has been shot and killed on the street one freezing winter night. This occurs in front of a collection of four houses, containing four families. Anton Steenjwijk, then a 12 year old boy, is about to have is life irrevocably changed in the following minutes. Mistaken information, deliberate misdirection and a Gestapo that really doesn't care if the gets the murderer, just so long as it appears someone is made to pay...all these factors have a part to play in Anton's confusion (at the time and for years to come) regarding this unforgettable night.His story continues through to 1981, and despite his every attempt to suppress his memory of this night of horror, a series of chance meetings, sporadically spread over the years with other people involved in that infamous few moments, bring him to finally and painfully understand the peculiar circumstances that occurred that fateful evening.*END SPOILER*Well written (nothing seems to be lost in translation to English), intriguing and almost impossible to put down. The story is so poignant, so emotionally traumatizing, when seen through Anton's eyes, it's almost impossible not to empathize with him, even though he spends most of his adult years trying to simply forget.Conclusion:A short story about some of the horrific events of WW II. Not really graphic, but told in a manner that inspires awe and admiration towards the gifted author and the people about whom he writes. 5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.Those of us who have never experienced a hostile occupation, especially of the scale that occurred in WW II and the abuse that accompanied it, can never really appreciated what memories the survivors must have. I've looked after War Vets, and every once in a while you'd see a guy sitting by himself, quietly crying...you'd never interfere, you knew why...memories!

I remember being enthralled with this series when it came on TV years ago; it was the one show that my son and I would not miss. We awaited each new installment with great anticipation.So we decided to purchase this series of discs when they were offered; they (the discs) were expensive, but you know what those good memories are like...well, they sometimes have a way of clouding sound judgement.And with the result...What a disappointment; what a bore! Have I changed that much with time? I fail to understand how this series could have, at one time, enamoured me so much. Now, this childish, immature cartoon series, that I once thought was so great, has me shaking my head in disbelief.One of the other reviewers, seemed to indicate that something had been left out; maybe so, because something seems different. But then, maybe it's me. In any event, a major letdown! 2 Stars...1 Star (because it's the least available) plus 1 Star for the memories.

An excellent first book in this trilogy fantasy series!Well written and easy to read, I found this book had just about everything one could ask for in a good (bordering on great) fantasy story; that being love, deceit, unexpected twists and turns, creatures and people with special talents and of course, a liberal dose of magic sprinkled through out the entire novel.The Pros:a.)There was substantial character development through out the entire series, and not just the main characters. The good guys had some faults and the bad guys usually had a few redeeming traits making it difficult at times, to separate the two.b.)Multiple, complex and convoluted story lines; just when things seem to be leveling out something else happens to reshape the scheme of things.The Cons:Only one, that being; I found it easy to get a little confused at times because of the number of twists and turns that occurred, especially in the third book.A good book featuring an extremely interesting and complex fantasy adventure. Recommended!4 and Stars.

I was disappointed with this DVD!As soon as I saw the overture with a young, stiff, seemingly terrified Claudio Addado at the conductors podium I got uneasy vibes. Then, the fact that the production was a movie did little to reassure me. Add to this, that the audio was lip-synced to the video (and rather poorly at that) further downgraded my enthusiasm for this production.The characters had costumes that were overdone and seemed, to me, to add very little to the intended comic effect. The comedy, in fact, seemed to be almost slapstick at times: contrived, not to mention chaotic.So, were there no redeeming features to this production? Yes, the music of Rossini: wonderful tunes, good voices and the orchestrated aspect of the opera was well done despite the above mentioned distractions.But surely there must be a better Barber of Seville on DVD out there somewhere.

Probably my favorite and most watched ballet DVD!The title of this DVD really fits perfectly; "Variety and Virtuosity" features not only some of the classical standards of ballet but also a few modern works to show off the talented dancers that make up the American Ballet Theatre. In this disc the group performs ensemble sets as well as several Pas de Deux.Although the DVD only lasts 83 minutes it contains some real gems: just to mention a few......- the great athletic and dancing skills (along with the colorful costumes) of Angel Corella and Paloma Herrera in Minkus's Don Quixote.-Alessandra Ferri and Julio Bocca do a wonderful interpretation of young lovers in their balcony scene Pas de Deux from Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet. Their dancing and expressions are so sensitive that you could almost feel the love that their characters had for one another. In addition, Ferri has in some way, an indescribable allure to go with her infectious smile that draws your eye to her.-However, the highlight of the entire disc was, to me, the husband and wife team of Amanda McKerrow and John Gardner in The Leaves are Fading . ( choreography by Antony Tudor, music by Antonin Dvorak) This is one of those ballets that combine the perfect music with the perfect dance; and McKerrow and Gardner simply do a magnificent job in expressing the quiet joy and subtle sadness of this masterpiece by Mr. Tudor. I have watched this particular dance frequently since I got this DVD and I seem to see something new with each viewing. The ending is so exquisitely beautiful and peaceful it near moves me to tears. It has gotten to the point that I cannot imagine this music being played without this dance accompanying it.All in all, this fabulous disc is a must have if you have any interest in great ballet. Highly recommended.

An incredible fantasy/adventure.I've been a fantasy reader for years now and thought I'd about run the gambit of available books/authors to read. I'd just recently finish Steven Erikson's "Malazan Book of the Fallen"(5 books) and Scott Bakker's "Prince of Nothing" (2 Books) and felt that these efforts were about as good epic fantasy as I've ever come across. That is, until I found this book in the "Fire and Ice" series; this book by G.R.R. Martin is, I think, one the best I've ever read in the fantasy genre.Why?... let me elaborate.We've all heard a great story teller whose voice kind of mesmerizes you and you become completely absorbed in what is being spoken. Well, this story has the same effect but with the written word instead of the spoken.The story is huge in scope and breadth but yet it does not ramble on with endless fill. Each chapter, even each paragraph, seems to bring some point of interest that adds to the aura of the story being presented. It is simply readable in the purest sense: you want to get back to this book; you look for time to have to yourself to get "a get a few more pages in". It's that good!The characters seem real, believable: some you love and others you love to hate. There is travel, battles, magic and betrayals. Something for all fantasy lovers; but more important, done with a quality that stands out and leaves you eager for more.

I bought this New Year's Gala DVD because I liked the themes associated with Bizet's Carmen, which were prominently featured in the program. Also, well known names like Bryn Terfel, Claudio Abbado, Anne Sophie von Otter and Robert Alagna added to the luster of the evening's performance. The concert was very nice: great orchestra with a world renowned conductor, wonderful singers and then.....there was Gil ShahamI remember as a teen buying an album for a particular song and every so often (rarely) you would find a hidden gem that was unexpected and quite often better than the piece you had originally purchased the album for. Such is the case here: Gil Shaham is a violin virtuoso extraordinaire! His performance of Pablo de Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy op 25 it simply breath taking. The piece is full of joyous energy, technical skill and shows a man that is one with his instrument. An unbelievable performance of a beautiful piece of music that must have been thrilling to have witnessed live.The rest to the disk is very good but this one piece is worth the price of the entire DVD.

A very good, interesting game that got better as it went along!This is a third person shooter with weapon upgrades; the location is on the alien infested moon, Ganymede.The Pros:1.)Good, spooky atmosphere; many darkened rooms and outdoor areas that are only partially visible with your flashlight beam.2.)Audio; although not dazzling, it is effective in adding a sense of edginess of the overall game play.3.)Initially I was disappointed that this was a 3rd person vs. 1st person shooter. However, with time this concern was less and less important in the overall game play. The third person overhead view does help with showing you a little bit about the rooms immediately next to you. (some with obvious aliens inside) This had the advantage of allowing you to plan ahead.4.)10 different weapons, each with 3 different upgrades available (some of which are very useful, others less so, but then again it depends a lot on the opponent(s) you are up against at the moment) The weapons upgrades were varied enough to make choosing an improvement (and using up those hard earned experience points) a matter that required some thought, but overall was a lot of fun.5.)An interesting variety of monsters, each with his own strengths and weakness; half the fun is trying to determine that weakness and picking the appropriate weapons that will be effective against it. Not as easy as it sounds.6.)An intriguing assortment of ways to defeat your opponents by using your surroundings and your different weapons to your advantage. (some obvious, other less so)7.)The action was, at times, intense and hectic but never boring.The Cons:(singular)1.)No save game feature: the game has ten sections of varying length and difficulty. You have 5 lives for each of these game sections. If you lose all five lives you must restart the section (not the entire game) again from the beginning. Initially this was annoying, but with time I liked this system as it gave me time to study the surroundings and try different weapons when I'd have to replay a level.All in all, a great action game that was intense, exciting and had no trouble holding my interest. 5 Stars!Addendum /08:Having played and finished the sequel to this game, 'Shadow Ground Survivor' I'd recommend that this game; is the much better of the two. This sequel is, in general OK, but it's much shorter, easier and less intense; however the ending is do-able on the newer game.

Well, I must admit to some disappointment with this book...let me explain.This book came highly recommended by bookstore personnel and after reading the reviews on the dust cover and at amazon.com I decided to buy it.While initially, I found the book humorous with its typical British style of dry wit, I soon became aware of an impending sense of deja vu. I found myself returning to thoughts of those early and dreaded grammar school lessons (at which I did very poorly) From thereon the book became tedious and difficult to read and enjoy. I was back in school and this book was really a teaching manual; something to be studied and learned, i.e work. I could not finish it.The other interesting thing was that two friends who saw this book sitting on the table and borrowed it, ended up with the same impression as I did. (and the same unfinished result)Obviously, some people loved this book (see other reviews) but it was not what I was looking for.

A good conclusion to this excellent fantasy trilogy.Well written and easy to read, I found this book had just about everything one could ask for in a good (bordering on great) fantasy story; that being love, deceit, unexpected twists and turns, creatures and people with special talents and of course a liberal dose of magic sprinkled through out the entire novel.The Pros:a.)There was substantial character development through out the entire series, and not just the main characters. The good guys had some faults and the bad guys usually had a few redeeming traits.b.)Multiple, complex and convoluted story lines; just when things seem to be leveling out something else happens to reshape the scheme of thingsThe Cons:a.)I found it easy to get a little confused at times because of the number of twists and turns that occurred, especially in the third book.b.)Kuikui...I found that Kuikui's trips to the nether world to save children a bit too frequent and repetitious; even more annoying was the fact that she had to be rescued herself on several occasion by others.c.)And last, I took one star off the rating because, as one of the others reviewers noted, the later third of this book seemed really rushed; so many loose ends and major battles hurriedly finished off in the last 25 or so pages. Maybe the author was getting tired (or had publishing deadlines) and just wanted to finished.A good finale for this trilogy; it is an extremely interesting and complex fantasy adventure. Recommended!4 Stars.

Let me say that Giselle is one of my favorite ballets; I love Adam's music, the choreography and the story.I really wanted to like this Giselle; I could hardly wait to get the DVD home and in the player. However, this shortened movie version of Giselle starring Natalya Bessmertnova and M. Lavrovski was disappointing to say the least.I have a several areas of concern with this DVD production... to mention a few- The sets are "barebones" with flat color tones and meager drop back curtains; there is little or no "scenery" to give one the feeling of the rustic quaintness that seems to be the norm in other Giselles. The cast almost looks lost on this huge stage.- The music/audio is flawed: there is an annoying high pitched tinny quality to a lot of the higher notes throughout the entire performance: this is very distracting and although I could diminish this effect by tweaking my audio system, I could not get this problem to disappear entirely.-With the entire ballet only 82 minutes long, they decided to leave out the Peasant Pas de deux at the end of the Act I.... Need I say more.-And finally, to me, Giselle has always represented ballet at its emotional best: with Adam's haunting melodies and the beautiful choreography taking the audience the full gambit between initial happiness and gaiety to final sadness and grief. In this production, although the dancing is technically good, it lacks any arousing impact; the performers went through the dance steps,but they didn't seem to be very convincing or committed in their acting. For instance, Bessmertnova tends to look very serious most of the time in the opening scenes where she is suppose to be flirting and falling in love with Albrecht; any rare smile seems forced and unnatural. (Then again, the camera settings were often so far back, that it was difficult to see the faces of the participants.)-On a positive note, however, the Wilis' costumes in Act II were stunning; the skirts were sheer, moved beautifully with the lifts and generally enhanced the impression of them being apparitions .All in all a disappointing DVD, with poor audio, devoid of any real beauty in the stage sets and lacking much emotional punch.P.S. If you were looking to buy a Giselle on DVD I'd highly recommend the La Scala version with Alessandra Ferri and Massimo Murru. ( the sets, costumes and emotional content are all 5 stars)

'Andre Rieu: Live from Vienna' is, without question, one of the most outstanding Andre concerts I've had the privilege to watch.The setting is the plaza in front of the beautiful Hofburg Palace in central Vienna. Recorded on a quiet, beautiful and warm (audience and ladies of the orchestra in bare shoulders) summer evening; a perfect set of conditions for a concert such as this.First, the technical:It's hard to imagine all the technical and logistical happenings that had to occur to make this evening a success. The plaza had a false floor inserted for seating accommodations and traffic was apparently rerouted around the area for a week in advance of the concert to allow the structural changes needed in the plaza to occur. The lighting, cameras were all perfectly placed, helping give that subtle, wonderful ambiance to the evening as night gradually overtook the concert.Then there was the coordination of the different concert elements...the orchestral, the costumes, the dancers. The number of rehearsals and the amount of time involved must have been staggering to get a concert of this size and magnitude to come off without an apparent hitch (even though I realize the final DVD product probably received major editing.I also like the candid shots of the audience...some caught singing, dancing and just generally enjoying themselves; and oh yes, there was the occasional tear.Second, the performance:The concert program featured several of Vienna's (plus surrounding areas) own historically prominent musicians; the most famous being Johann Strauss and W. A. Mozart, just to mention two. In fact the theme of the night was predominantly Strauss waltzes. One great melody after another, enhanced by the wonderful locale, costumes, players and dancers.But, more than just the setting and the music, the intangible quality that sets Andre Rieu's shows apart, is the obvious and sincere fun everyone on stage is having during the performance. And make no mistake about it, no one is having more fun than Andre, and this attitude seems to radiate from him and infects the rest of his cast. A joy to watch, as well as hear.Conclusion:A stunning DVD. Filled with all the pomp and pageantry that gives the viewer a small glimpse of what the old Austrian empire must have been like at its zenith, when it was considered to be the cultural center of the world.A couple of things regarding Andre Rieu.A tip of the hat for his foresight and perseverance to pull a show like this off; the worries and concerns must have been enormous, but you'd never know it to watch him on-stage. Always smiling and directing his charges with a smile, a look , an eyebrow or a stroke of his bow...all with the confidence of the consummate professional.Three personal favorite moments (from many):1.)Andre's short solo performance of the violin sonata/concerto during the Mozart medley.2.)Carla Maffioletti's 'Mein Herr Marquis' from Stauss's 'Die Fledermaus'.3.)The ballet by the Vienna Ballet and Folk Dance group of 'Ganz onhe Weiber geht die Chose nicht' from 'The Gypsy Princess'. (stunning costumes that flowed and moved perfectly with the music)Ray NicholsonP.S.And for all that I loved this performance, it still comes in second place among all other Andre Rieu's DVDs. My favorite is the show from Tuscany, Italy...a smaller, more intimate setting that oozes unbridled joy and spontaneity.

This is a series of DVDs on hitting the golf ball by teaching golf pro AJ Bonar. It encompasses the drive, irons, chipping, pitching, bunkers and putting.The first disc discusses some theory on how to hit the ball correctly; i.e. why the ball does what it does when you hit it. This same disc then proceeds to instruct on how to put the theory into real time application on the driving range and then the golf course with the goal of eliminating those troublesome slices and hooks.However, as good as the discs are on hitting the driver and irons, it is,The Short Game disc that is the real gem in this whole golf instruction package. This is the lesson that will absolutely help you get up and down from just off the green with great regularity with a simple, repeatable technique.The discs are high quality video, with some slow motion and animation to enhance the instruction. It doesn't take too long to realize that AJ Bonar is man that loves to teach: he has an ability to get his ideas across in a way that are easy to understand and, more importantly, makes sense. I addition to good golf instructions, AJ injects a sense of humor in these discs: they are just fun to watch.I've had these discs approximately a month now and I've benefited greatly by repeated viewings of certain segments of these lessons. There is so much information on these discs that it is impossible to see and absorb all the info with a single viewing. And like anything worthwhile you must go out and practice the ideas which AJ teaches.One other thing: I had a question regarding some point on the disc and wrote an e-mail to the support centre and I received an e-mail back the next day from AJ himself.All in all, a teaching golf package that delivered what the infomercial promised, (at least for me it did) and with a support system that you can actually benefit from.

Generally I enjoyed this game, but honestly, I was glad to be through it; paranormal horror is just not my preference for a FPS.The Pros:Good smooth action and great graphics if you've the hardware to run it properly.Spooky atmosphere, (better than Doom3) with some surprises that will give you a jolt.Easy game saves (and you need to do this very often) with the quick save F5 key, as well as several checkpoint saves done by the game itself.Some new weapons and some interesting enemies; The Slow/mo feature really added an interesting aspect of some of the firefights you get into. In fact, it would've been very difficult to get through this game without it.The Cons:1.)Very linear game play when on a mission.2.)Only three types of building used throughout the entire game; that being 1.) office tower, 2.) decaying apartment building and 3.) vault/research center. The office towers had the majority of the action; but the multiple cubbyhole workstations, made for very repetitious play and became quite monotonous after a while (not to mention confusing). There was only a few short outside scenes.3.)It was difficult, in many cases, to figure out where to go next, once your mission was completed (especially true in the office towers). I found that once you completed a mission, some previously locked door or gateway became open, and you had to go back and find it before you were able to proceed on your new task.4.)You only had access to your 3 most recent saved games; and, as you could only carry three weapons at any one time, it was sometimes difficult to know if you should pick up a new weapon (while discarding another one) just before you were about to change locales forever (where you could not possibly return to without restarting a previously saved game).5.)No "bosses" to fight, even at the end. A rather dull and anticlimactic finale. "Boss" fights have always been one of my favorite parts of FPSs and I missed them in this game.6.)And finally, the game has no replay value whatsoever; I can't think of a single mission or scene I'd be remotely interested in replaying again.All in all, a different type of FPS. If you don't mind the horror aspect, then this is a game you might enjoy.

I enjoyed the game with some minor reservations ...let me explainThe Pros:I've a half decent video card and mother board so the game loaded easily and played smoothly for me; resulting in good audio and great graphics.The action takes place in both indoors and outdoors; and in some of the outdoor scenes you have the added fun of controlling [and from the first person perspective] 1.) a hover tank, 2.) a walker robot, and 3.) a machine gun on a monorail tram. I've always enjoyed this type of scenario in FPS and these 3 segments are really well done.Some challenging Bosses that'll give you a run for your money.Save the game where ever you like with the F5 quick save feature.Cons:The game play is somewhat repetitious at times, especially with the indoor settings; and also with the main opponent, that being the basic Strogg soldier, who becomes fairly easy prey after you get a few good weapons.High gore level (which you can adjust in "options"); but I'm not sure that any graphics need to be this intense.The Ending: for all the difficulty of some of the Bosses throughout (and especially just prior to the end), the finale itself is surprisingly simple. (once you know the way to do it)All in all a good game; anyone that's liked previous Quakes, Doom, Half-Like, Far Cry etc. will enjoy this FPS.

There's no need to rehash the plot of GRR Martin's fabulous "A Song of Ice and Fire" series; everyone remotely interested in this extraordinary piece of fantasy/adventure is familiar with its medieval story-line.Things I liked in this HBO series...1.) it's not often a movie-series turns out to be the perfect visual compliment to what many consider to be the gold standard for epic fantasy writing...but this does. It captures the atmosphere, the subtle edginess, those brutal, unexpected moments; it really does grasp the mood and essence of the book.2.) in addition to presenting a riveting tale, the production gives us acting that brings the books' characters to life in realistic settings.3.) a computer enhanced animated map is shown as a short cut scene at the start of each episode. Giving those of us familiar with the books a brief refresher and those new to the series a sense of the geography, direction and distances.4.) a pulsating, musical score to start each episode that perfectly fits the heraldic spirit of this story.Conclusion:HBO has done a wonderful job making this first book (Game of Thrones), into a first rate TV series. 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A fabulous finale!This is the concluding book in the "Prince of Nothing" trilogy by Scott Bakker. I'd waited in eager anticipation for this release; I was not disappointed.The Pros:1.)The book effectively ties up the loose ends of previous episodes and (thankfully) comes to a definitive ending; and, not surprisingly, it may have opened a few new treads at the conclusion as well. This book deals with the same major characters as the previous books; that being Kellhus, Achamian(Akka), Esmenet and Cnaiur, as well as a new "concern" that was mentioned passingly in previous books.2.)Well written, gripping and intriguing right from the word go, this book was a page turner; also there was an erotic quality in some areas that was "intense" to say the least. As with most great fantasy novels there is a liberal dose of magic, deceit, love, betrayal and some really great battles.3.)In addition to the story itself, there are 3 maps at the back of the book to keep you abreast of the Holy Wars' locations: as well, there is a 100 page "Encyclopedic Glossary" at the end of this book giving added descriptions of persons, places and things mentioned in the trilogy. (it's this "glossary" that makes you realize the effort that the author has put into developing the storyline of this epic fantasy)The Cons:And yet, despite the greatness of the story, there were segments of this book that I did not find easy to read; e.g. I found I really had to concentrate hard to try to understand some of the philosophical discussions between Akka and Kellhus and likewise for some chapters dealing with the internal musings of Akka and Cnaiur as they went through periods of internal crisis. Thankfully, these chapters were short and infrequent, making my "complaint" a minor issue when weighed against the overall quality of the rest of this book.All in all, if you liked the previous installments of this series, I think you will find the conclusion equally enjoyable. Recommended! 4 1/2stars.

A short hauntingly beautiful piece of early writing by George R.R. Martin...circa mid 70's.*SPOILER FILLED*Atmosphere is the key word to describe the stunning imagery of sunsets, landscapes and castles in a world populated by a single person...Laren Dorr. Then one day, by a whim of fate, a visitor (Sharra) suddenly arrives through one of the 'gates' (a traveling portal, if you will) in her never ending search for someone. She is weary and injured, but is tended to and healed by Laren. Through time, they tell stories of love lost, loneliness, their unique circumstances and of their mutual hate for The Seven...guardians of the gates who are trying to capture Sharra and at the same time, prevent Laren from leaving this world.The situation that both visitor and host find themselves trapped in, makes for a compelling tale. You can feel the crushing isolation, the eons of loneliness and weariness of both parties that are revealed in their individual tales (songs) that they relate to each other. It is heart rending to see the budding relationship and the positive effects that companionship and conversation has formed between them, only knowing full well that they will have to separate and return to their solitary existences. For Sharra must continue her quest and Laren can't go with her because neither one of them alone, or both together, is strong enough to survive a confrontation with The Seven.Conclusion.A sad and moving short story...exquisitely told. 5 StarsRay Nicholson

Band of Brothers: An unbelievable event, made for TV. Produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, this series, based on true occurrences, has all the realism and gut wrenching tension that we saw in "Saving Private Ryan".I had no idea of what was in store for me when I dropped the first disc in the DVD player. I was simply mesmerized: I could have sat through the entire series non-stop except for the fact the five movie discs plus one specialty disc took up about 12 hours. I could hardly wait for the next day to arrive to watch the next segment.The series is about a group of men that volunteer for the newly formed parachute regiment and eventually drop in behind enemy lines in Normandy, France on D-day, June 6, 1944. They eventually end up capturing Hitler's Eagle's Nest retreat in Austria as WWll ends.When I saw "Saving Private Ryan" I didn't think that any war movie could be better: I was wrong. Band of Brothers is well acted, incredible realistic and shows you what a prolonged campaign must have been like with the constant stress and tension that turned boys into men and men into.....As this series develops, from one story to the next, you begin to appreciate the meaning of the cliche " the fog of war": sometimes simple sorties turn into unexpected nightmares and then other times when all seem lost, something or someone, completely unexpected, will turn up and save the day. You just can never predict in war what will happen: who will turn in a hero or a man paralyzed with fear or fatigue. Nothing is ever a 100% sure bet.Adding to the drama of the story are the interviews with the actual participants who lived through this horrific period and are still alive today. You can still see the agony in some of their faces when they recall old events and missing friends that didn't return home with them. Unbelievably touching!All in all an incredible series: something everyone should see just to make you realize what these men (and women) went through for us. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid.

A movie of exceptional quality!I'm a great fantasy fan and after seeing the trailers I decided to go see this movie, not really expecting anything special; to say I was stunned by the unique story, the acting and the cinematography would be a gross understatement.The story take place in a rural, mountainous area of Spain during the Spanish Civil war in the 1930's or 40's. Part of the tale is about the civil war but there is another more 'magical' conflict going on at the same time, hidden deep beneath the earth's surface; as you might imagine the two tales become intertwined as the story progresses.Be forewarned, this is not a movie for children or the faint of heart. There are some scenes containing unspeakable cruelty and this will, without doubt, be a major turnoff to some. However, I found the violence within the context of the story and the era involved. (unlike some other movies where the violence seems to be gratuitous and is often there only for shock effect.Pan's Labyrinth is a foreign film with subtitles; I remember people complaining about this before and after the show. To me the subtitles enhanced the special effects of this movie; it added to the realism of the geographic area where the story took place. After 5 minutes, the subtitles went virtually unnoticed because the story was so enthralling and the acting so good.Conclusion;One of my favorite movies; a true gem.However, not all movie buffs will like this movie because of the fantasy component and the graphic scenes. But in my opinion it easily rates 5 Stars...more if I could.R.Nicholson

This is an interesting FPS that allows you to use 'time' as one of your weapons in defeating the enemy; time can be slowed, stopped or even reversed. In fact, you won't get very far without using your one of your 3 'time' options to either defeat the enemy, avoid them or solve puzzles.Some brief comments on the good and not so good...The Pros:1.)Smooth flowing graphics, great special effects (ambient lighting, smoke, dust etc.) and good audio.2.)And to show off the graphics there are some stunning visuals once you get out of the urban area and into the country.3.)A large selection of weapons (although you can only carry 3 at anyone time) that have a primary and a secondary firing option. You have, for instance, your standard pistol, automatic carbine and shotgun but you will also come across a guidable rocket launcher, a sniper rifle, an energy gun, an incendiary pellet gun and an extremely powerful crossbow.4.)You have the ability to operate turret guns (both on the ground and on flying Zeppelins) and drive vehicles. Also, you can use 'time' when operating these units.5.)Easy, anytime save/load with F5/F9 respectively, as well as game generated checkpoint saves.6.)But the best (and most fun) feature of this game is the ability to alter time; however, the amount of 'time' you have to use is extremely limited, so using this asset wisely does require some thinking. Initially using 'time' was a huge advantage (especially against one or two enemy), but it soon became an absolute necessity as you proceed into some difficult combat situations (against larger, spread out groups) and also for some puzzles. There were areas that I had to 'inch' my way along (using frequent saves) to get through.7.)I felt the game scenarios and challenges improved as the game progressed.The Cons:1.)Fairly narrow path to follow; very little area in which to 'roam' around or explore. (not unusual for most FPSs I guess)2.)Limited replay value.3.)About the only irritating thing about this game was the non-stop, repetitive propaganda dialogue, spewing from the loud speakers that were everywhere in the first couple segments and the finale.4.)The game has fairly high hardware and video card requirements* (if you want to see it played as the developers intended).5.)On 'Normal' game difficulty I felt there were 2 things that took away from the overall challenge of the game, these were:a.)one weapon (crossbow) was a little too much of an advantage against the majority of the army-type personnel (it gives you the ability to easily pick off individual men from great distances).b.) Ammo was too readily available. There was no need to conserve ammo, no need to be concerned about running low on 'bullets'; ammo seemed to be everywhere.Conclusions:I really liked this game...A game that uses 'time' manipulation to add a definite twist to this otherwise excellent FPS. If the game developers had not given the gamer such an omnipotent weapon (crossbow) with an overabundance of ammo, this game would have been extremely challenging to play and finish. But for this drawback, this game may have been in the running for single player 'Game of the Year' honors**. Nonetheless, an impressive and graphically beautiful game...4-4 1/2 Stars.*System Specs...Played on Vista with an Intel Dual core processor, ASUS P5K motherboard, 2 GB RAM and Nvidia 8800 GTS video card**other nominees (IMO) for single player, 'Game of the Year' would be 'Bioshock', 'Half-Life 2 episode 2', and 'Call of Duty 4', closely followed by 'STALKER-Chernobyl', with 'Crysis' a more distant, second tier contender.

An fantasy/adventure that had great potential!I picked up this book as I was looking for something to read at the local library and despite the 'Harlequin Romance' like cover I decided to try it.Some likes and dislikes...The Pros:1.)The core of this book was developed around a very intriguing and interesting fantasy twist, i.e. the unique talent(s) this heroine had been given.2.)The character developments were fairly well done; reasonably genuine and believable people with traits the reader will identify with, and either like or dislike as the case may be.3.)The story itself was very good; it had the potential for being developed into a major stand alone work or maybe even an ongoing series.The Cons:1.)Although there were some great moments in this book, I found a few areas in which some of the writing was rather weak; especially with dialogues between characters in some situations.2.)The book was quite short; just over 200 pages, so some of the miraculous escapes (especially at towards the end) were done with out much explanation and generally seemed to lack detail. I had the feeling the author just wanted to get this work finished and said the heck with a realism or attempting to put more plausibility into the latter part of the story.3.)And finally, one personal concern. When I mentioned above that the cover had a 'Harlequin Romance' appearance to it...well so did an ongoing and undercurrent theme of this story. Unfortunately, the 'romance' aspect seemed to become more dominant towards the latter part of the book, and this may have been the reason that the description of the 'escape' near the end seemed to 'suffer' in relative importance, receiving less attention than it deserved.To me I guess it comes down to this; if you like your high fantasy 'burdened with swooning hearts' well fine and good; but not for me, thank you very much. It's just that I like fantasy that tends (by and large) to separate the its action from the romance.Conclusion:A fantasy/adventure that was so close to being great. The 'gift?' the heroine had, was extremely interesting; so much more could have been done with some better writing (in spots), providing some added descriptions and substance. One had the feeling that a good editor could have really helped polish this story and subsequently raised the standard to a greater height. 3 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

I was unable to get a consistent, satisfactory signal with this unit.I found that unless you had perfect alignment to the satellite, this antenna did not receive the signal consistently well. Also, the least movement of the connecting cord or if someone moved the blind/curtain, this would often be enough to move the antenna and thus disturb the exact positioning required to make this antenna function properly.In the end I returned this unit and got an extra car antenna (the one with the strong magnet); this allowed me to put an extension cord under the window sill to the outside. I then was able to easily find a site that gave me excellent, continuous satellite reception using the magnetic antenna (exact positioning is not nearly as demanding for the magnetic antenna). Since then my home unit has worked perfectly.

A game that started out great but quickly became disappointing...let me explain.The Pros:1.)Great graphics and good audio.2.)Easy to save/load with F5 and F9 respectively; but there is little reason to use these. [see Cons: 3.) below]3.)A few new weapons and a couple of new transport systems.The Cons:1.)Repetitious play. About half way through you've met all the various aliens that are going to try to obstruct your path.All levels involve killing all the aliens to open up a portal to the next level. This is basically the entire game.2.)There are a few levels involving some flying of a lightly armed shuttle-craft; however the encounters with the enemy aircraft usually occur in an area where there is not much space and the enemy is much faster and more maneuverable than you. You're better off to quickly land your craft at a docking pod and engage the enemy fighters from the ground.3.)BUT, the most annoying feature of actual game play is the fact that it doesn't matter if you live of die in a fight...Why? Well, let me elaborate a little; because you play a native Cherokee Indian you have connections to the spirit world. If you die you simply go to the spirit world, restock up on hit points and return to the game at the point where you died. There is no reason to fight for your life if you're taking a beating; just stand there, get killed, get automatically transported to the spririt world, reload on hit points and start again where you left off. Initially this seemed like a great feature, but it quickly became obvious that all the fun and uncertainty of major battles disappeared because you now can win all battles by simply wearing down your opponent's hit points, as he/she cannot renew theirs, at crucial times, like you can.4.) The game is only available on the "easy" level until you beat it the first time; the problem being, I can't think of a single level I'd want to play again on any level. (easy or difficult)5.)Also, if you wanted to play the game again on the difficult level, you must go through the entire bar sequence at the beginning of the game and also watch a prolonged movie segment at the start of the first level in the alien ship; there is no way to skip these sections and they are tediously long.All in all a game that had great potential but instead was a disappointment in many ways; too easy and repetitious are just 2 of the a series of problems with this FPS.2 Stars

A wonderful fantasy adventure read.This is a book written with an adolescent audience in mind, however it has the writing quality and story line to keep most adult fantasy/adventure lovers contented.Personally I liked this book better than "Airborn", (which I felt had some very convienent solutions to solve some of its near impossible situations). This book, (featuring the same main charcters and the same zepellin like airships), seemed to me, to have a better conclusions for the various twists and turns that the heroes encountered.I found this book hard to put down and would have no hesitancy in recommending it for anyone what wants an interesting, action packed story.5 Stars!

An enjoyable continuation of the series.Although the story for this novel takes place on Corus, the action occurs many years before the Alucius based trilogy; and of course, there is an entirely new set of characters.This is a tale told with similar characteristics as the previous three novels in this series. The story is not profoundly deep, but good story telling techniques, plenty of action and a couple of heros not too far removed from the Alucius mold make it an interesting fantasy/adventure read.Anyone who liked the previous three books will, I'm sure, enjoy this one as well; also, there are enough loose ends in the last couple of chapters to make one look forward to the final installment of this series.

This DVD is a collection of 15 Pas de deux covering a time span of 31 years. (1965-1996). It includes such well know ballet stars as Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Makhalina, and Asylmuratova to mention a few.The entire compilation tries to focus on presenting the performers when they were in their prime. For instance the segment featuring Nureyev and Fonteyn was recorded in 1965 and although the picture is a little grainy, it is more than adequate to give us a glimpse of what these artists could do when they were at their best.Some of my favorite pieces were...- Spring Waters with Maria Bylova and Leonid Nikonov; with their fast paced,energetic leaps and lifts.- Romeo and Juliet (balcony scene) with Alessandra Ferri and Wayne Eagling; an early example of Ferri's acting and interpretation skills that we would continue to see develop, in the years to follow.- Swan Lake (Black Swan scene) with Julia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky; Makhalina show us (as Odile) just how poised, incredibly flexible and talented she really is in this role. She is simply stunning.-and last but not least the Don Quixote pas de deux with Cynthia Harvey and Mikhail Baryshnikov. This features some of Baryshnikov's world famous leaps and spins. Enough said!There were a couple of segments that I didn't enjoy as some of the others; but that would to be expected in a &quot;sampling&quot; of a series of pas de deux. Also a couple of dancers and choreographers were featured multiple times(3); this I found a little puzzling on a relatively short, one disc recording.An enjoyable DVD and although the video quality my change a bit from one performance to the next, you still have to feel grateful just being able to watch and appreciate some of the greatest dancers of the last century.

I liked this DVD from beginning to end !This is the movie version of Verdi's tragic masterpiece Rigoletto. I must admit, that up to this point, I had not been a big fan of operas that had been made into movies: but I have to make an exception in this instance. Filmed in Italy by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, the settings consist of real castles, streets and rivers that lend a sublime atmosphere and ambience to the opera being presented here. It would be impossible for a stage version to present such elaborate surroundings. The costumes, throughout, are nothing short of sumptuous and fit perfectly into the era they were intended to represent. The camera angles were well placed with the only negative comment being that some of the facial shots were ultra closeup.This work stars Ingvar Wixell (Rigoletto), Luciano Pavarotti (Duke of Mantova) and Edita Gruberova (Gilda).Luciano Pavarotti is in his singing prime in this production and his acting, although not great, is passable. Gruberova has a great voice and does justice to her part as Gilda. It is however Ingvar Wixell that commands the audiences' attention with his fabulous interpretation of the tragic hero, Rigoletto. His performance, in my opinion, is worthy of acting honors and his singing voice is as impressive as his stage presence throughout the entire work. He simply carries the show from beginning to end.I was much more impressed with this performance than I thought I would be and could highly recommended it without any reservations: A Rigoletto you will be happy to own.

A satisfying finale!This series by Sean Russell is one of the best fantasy reads I've had in ages. It has everything I enjoy in this genre; love, hate, betrayal, friends/enemies in unusual places, unexpected twists and turns and a liberal dose of magic throughout this work. The conclusion to this epic good versus evil struggle ends with a much anticipated and long awaited battle that will, I think, leave most fantasy reader satisfied.(and maybe wishing for more)What separates this trilogy from so many others is the quality of the prose. Russell writes with an impressive descriptive style and is able to give us a range of characters that go from easily likable to just plain despicable(and lots in between). I found this novel hard to put down and often read late into the night.The SINGLE negative (and loss of star) for this book (and the entire series) is the fact that there is no map; a map that would have made following the travels of our heroes so much easier and enjoyable.All in all, a great final installment for this epic fantasy trilogy. Easily recommended for all fantasy lovers. 4 Stars.

This is a stage production performed without a live audience. Natalie Makarova directed the choreography and Tchaikovsky's ballet was played by the Danish Radio Symphony orchestra conducted by Graham Bond. The sets have a beautiful mystical quality to them and the costumes are exquisite: the atmosphere is perfect for this ballet.The principal dancers are Evelyn Hart of the Royal Winnepeg Ballet and Peter Schaufuss.I had first seen this performance (in part) as a PBS feature some years ago and although I'd no real experience with ballet in the past I knew as soon as I'd seen Ms Hart come on stage that I was watching someone special. Thus, when I had the opportunity, I was delighted to buy the DVD.Having had time to view this Swan Lake I must say that I can only reconfirm my initial impression of the Prima Ballerina. Ms. Hart has all the qualities to make a great leading dancer: poise, grace, an unbelievable sense of balance, and extension that almost makes her arms and legs look like they must be leaving their sockets. However, the thing that seemed to impress me the most was the expressiveness and suppleness of her arm and hand movement: almost like she had no joints in her upper limbs.Peter Schaufuss is a perfect leading male for this work. He is a supreme dancer, athletic and also blessed with grace and balance. The pas de deux are the highlights of this ballet and they are simply breathtaking. Mr. Schaufuss is able to lift his ballerina so delicately and smoothly that you barely know that he is there: his touch, so subtle, so sure, that his partner can have every confidence in performing her difficult routine; and what a performance it is. Just a joy to watch!And now, the negative (singular) and thus the loss of one star. The wicked sorcerer is portrayed, several times, by an animated ghost-like bird that must have been transposed on the main film. This gimmick, this photographic trickery, almost ruins an otherwise stellar performance of this Swan Lake. What was the director thinking when he added this apparition to this star studded work. Totally unnecessary! So annoying that as you watch this beautiful work, you begin to become uneasy, knowing that this abomination is going to appear and almost ruin the magic that has gone on before.All in all, despite the previously mentioned distraction, let me say that dancing of the principals is so exquisite that this is a Swan Lake you would be happy to make part of any ballet collection.

Having played and finished all three of the most system demanding FPSs of this year, that being Doom 3, Half Life 2 and Far Cry, I have to give FAR CRY my unequivocal vote for the best of the best award.Why this game over the rest you ask? Fair question, let me explain...There is one thing they all have in common and that's outstanding graphics: on that point there is no question. Where Far Cry has a slight advantage is in its enemy AI that makes it a challenge to play against and to defeat (maybe a little too hard towards the end, even on easy). However the one thing Far Cry has over the other two notable candidates is its nonlinear game play. You can, in this game get directly from point "A" to point "B" if you want to, but you may be able to accomplish the same task easier and at less risk by getting to point "B" by going to point "C" or point "D" first. There is just so much more choice and in turn just so much more fun. It simply has a replay value that the other don't have.That is not to say that Doom 3 and Half Life 2 aren't great games; they are and then some.The other thing besides the linear game play that took some of the edge off Doom 3 for me, was the relentless darkness and gloom. True, this initially added to the super scary atmosphere, but I found that this effect started to wear off about 1/3 of the way through.To some extent the same held true with Half Life 2. The facial features and lip sync were fabulously done. The air-propeller driven water buggy and the dune buggy episodes were really fun, but I found the long segments through bombed out apartment buildings and parking garages somewhat repetitive and tedious after a while.All in all a great year for the FPSs if you have the hardware and the system to play any of these three games as they should be seen. Far Cry just has that little bit extra that makes it my choice for game of the year..

"The Time Traveler's Wife" in a novel of fiction, written by Audrey Niffenegger. It is 518 pages in length.Time to fuss up:1.) I picked this book up in desperation. I was out of books to read, awaiting my next order from Amazon. Looking at the title, I surmised that this was a tale about an Alzheimer's patient who kept drifting in and out of the years gone by (hence, the time traveler reference in the title). Nothing could have interested me less and nothing was further from reality of this story. The book was not about dementia and was, in fact, about time-travel.2.)For the first 50 or so pages I was totally confused and bored. I could have given this book up in a heart beat, with nary a thought of regret. But I plowed on, and I'm very glad I did.*SPOILER*This is a love story between Henry (the time traveler) and Clare, his significant other. We get to see their ever changing relationship from various dates and places due to Henry's unpredictable time traveling ability.*END SPOILER*Neffenegger has managed to weave a magical tale that encompasses a host of emotions...love, humor, sex and above all, a beautiful, touching sadness; emotions that not only affect the characters within the book but also the readers as well. This is, at times, not a particularly happy story and I found it very difficult to not get caught up in the events and emotions that befall our heroes.If Neffenegger has one strength it is story telling skills; the writing simply gets better and better as you get deeper into this novel. The story which starts as light and somewhat carefree, changes subtly with each chapter; a change that is so minute that the reader really doesn't realize the ever increasing significance of the alteration of the mood and circumstance. And by the end you are so riveted to the events surrounding Henry and Clare, it is hard to realize that the novel has come to and end...you just want a little more.Conclusion:A brilliant work. Wonderful character development and a deftly told magical tale.Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholosn

The picture on this LCD TV can be summed up with one word...Stunning!I investigated several LCD TVs before I bought this one; and I'm very happy with my decision.The Pros:1.) Crystal clear image when viewed from a source with High Def.(HD) broadcast AND you have the necessary cables. [see below Cons: 1.)]2.) 4000:1 contrast ratio: this is basically a comparison between the whitest white and the blackest black that the TV can give. This ratio is outstanding and accounts for some of the units exceptional video performance.3.) Lots of inputs on the back; 2x HDMI inputs, 1x S-Video, components, PC connections; as well as output jacks for connections to home theatres.4.) Inputs on the side of the unit for external devices such as video games and camcorder; these include an A/V input and a S-Video input jack. There is also a Headphone jack for private listening.5.) The external cabinet is a high gloss metallic surface that just glistens; I don't think I ever seen a TV as eye appealing as this one.6.) Comes with a good swivel stand and fully functioning remote.The Cons:1.) The unit does not come with any connecting cables except for the power cord; so, if you want the best HD reception you need to get a triple video (Y/pb/pr) or a HDMI cable. Also, you may require S-Video or component cables if they are needed for other external input devices (VCR, DVD etc).2.) Some other reviewers have felt the audio/speakers were somewhat weak; I thought they were adequate. I purchased this unit for its video aspect; if I want top end sound I can hook this TV up to my stereo system.All in all, in spite of the minor concerns mentioned above, this is an outstanding LCD TV; the picture is as good as I could ever wish for. If your looking to invest in a high end HD TV, then you owe it to yourself to check out this unit before you make your decision. 5 Stars.

Original L4D review of Nov 18, 2008'Left 4 Dead' is a great new 4 man co-op or single player FPS game from VALVE.The GAME:This game is a 4 player journey of survival; it can be played as single player (with 3 computer comrades) or with 3 other people on-line. The trek begins in any of 4 different locations and ends in another part of town with an extraction to safety if you survive. (or a nice mention, in memoriam, if you don't)The Pros:1.)Great graphics and audio. The atmosphere is very dusky and eerie; lighting is sparse in buildings except for your flashlight (kind of reminds me of 'Doom 3'). Creeping into a pitch black room with only a flashlight to find it either empty, full of zombies or even worse, harbouring a super mutant is visceral to say the least.2.)The action is fast paced and hectic; there is not a lot of down time between one attack and the next. Attacks either by a hoard of undead or a super mutant comes at a fairly regular clip. Half the fun here is trying to find out what weakness the monsters have and what works best against them.3.)Weaponry come in the form of guns (shotgun, sniper rifle, automatic machine gun and pistols) explosives consist of pipe bombs and Molotov fire bombs.4.)You can start the game from the beginning any one of four campaigns OR at the beginning of any chapter within a campaign. Each section of the game is reasonably short, so you don't have to redo the entire game if you have to shut down for a while [see Cons: 2.) below]. Also, if your team dies while playing, you restart from the last 'safe-house' you made it to.5.)The game resets weapons, monsters, and health packs for every new game; so each game is slightly different than the last, although played over the same geographic area.6.)Certain 'achievements' are awarded throughout the game for accomplishing certain things. I initially thought these were a perk or upgrade, but now I don't think so...they just recognize certain 'accomplishments' i.e. setting a 'tank' afire or pushing away a 'hunter', and many others.They add absolutely nothing to the game play and they were not available in the demo.7.)You have the ability to set up a game from the Undead point of view; haven't tried this yet.8.)A couple of nice on-line game features:a.] you can change the difficulty setting ANYTIME; great if it's too easy or if your taking a continual poundingb.] if you have a player that is 'disruptive' to the team play, you can kick that player out of the game by simply taking a vote among the other three on-line players. (I was surprised that this actually happened a couple of times while I was playing)c.)And finally, a truly great feature; You can 'Take a Break' from an on-line game by pressing ESC> Take a Break> anytime while playing; great for a call to the BR or to take a phone call. When you 'Take a Break' you go 'Idle' while your away and your computer player takes over until you get back into the game (by pressing the left mouse key).The Cons: (all minor)1.)A fairly linear game; only a little room to travel off the prescribed path. Yet, in retrospect, having played this game many times, it would be difficult for this game to function properly with a 'open world', given the fighting style required for on-line co-op; each segment is a fairly short 'meat' run from point 'A' to point 'B'.2.)No game saves...none; and this is understandable from the 4 player on-line game. However with the single player game, the chapters aren't terribly long BUT they do require a degree of concentration and work to finish, especially on the higher difficulty levels. And somehow losing all your hard fought gains if you have to leave the game unexpectedly, seems a little unfair; you'll understand more clearly what I mean once you begin to play.3.)The AI of your comrades in the single person game needs one small modification; your buddies will guard you, heal you and stay near you BUT, they won't pick up the extra pipe bombs or Molotov bombs that often sit there before them. And it would be really helpful in the single person game-play if they did, especially on advanced and expert.Suggestions:I can not stress how much headphones/microphone add to the enjoyment of playing this game on-line; especially with communicating with your on-line playing partners. If you can, try playing with a headset, you won't believe the difference.Conclusion:A new FPS that requires 4 player co-operation (in both single and on-line play) to be successful. You may get away with a little 'individuality' on 'Easy', but on 'Normal', 'Advanced' or 'Expert' forget about it; if you don't travel and fight as a pack, your toast.The on-line co-op version is one of the greatest games EVER...IF played with the 4 players who have an understanding of the game concepts and are willing to work together. And that being said, having a maximum of 4 players for on-line play is probably the perfect number; 3 would not be enough to fend off the hoards (except on easy maybe) and with 5 players you'd be getting in each others way.The game chapters are fairly short and there are no game saves. However the game play is intense and visceral and you do tend to become wrapped up in the action that is taking place around you.And finally, this is one of those rare games that I just don't ever get tired of playing, (at least, with the on-line game)...and a game with this quality has to be in the running for game of the year.4 1/2 to 5 StarsRay Nicholson (cujo)Addendum: Oct 07/09"Crash Course"...some commentsFirst impressions from a co-op viewpoint...initially disappointing, but better since they've updated it (see comments below).A very short game...maybe 30 minutes or so consisting of only two segments. The map is mostly made up of streets littered with abandoned cars and trucks, and the buildings are mostly warehouses. This added map, although playable as single player or co-op, was primarily intended I believe, for Versus players.This map has improved since its original debut; updates have apparently removed a lot of the excess ammo and guns, making it a better challenge.The finale...interesting and takes some planning (although the final run to the rescue vehicle is extremely easy). Which leads to the one drawback in this new map...if you all die in the finale, you must restart at the last safehouse...about 15 minutes of travel to the ending.Conclusion:Now that the game (with the removal of all the extra guns and ammo) has become more of a challenge, I'll probably play this map a bit more...too bad they didn't make it a full map like the others (probably didn't want to divert too much attention away from the upcoming L4D2).Addendum: April 22/09"Survival"... some comments,Well the much anticipated update for Left 4 Dead has finally arrived. The new game is call 'Survival' and it IS aptly named. There are several new individual mods to this new game that use slight variations from some of the different sections of the 4 established games i.e. No Mercy, Death Toll, Dead Air and Blood Harvest. There is one brand new locale called 'Last Stand'; its setting is at a lighthouse and it's probably the most difficult game of the lot.Rather than a prolonged campaign these games are very short; and make no mistake about it, you are going to die. The challenge here is to see how long you can last; 4 minutes gets you a bronze medal, 7 minutes a silver and you get a gold medal if you last for ten minutes. Unlike the regular game, there is NO option for easy, normal etc. difficulty; just the one standard for everyone; "brutal" might be a good name for this newness addition.In the regular game you get attacked by hordes of zombies, with an occasional smoker, hunter or tank thrown in, but usually not all at once. However in this game, you get attacked by ALL types of infected, all at once. In addition, there is no long stretch to outrun a tank; not that that matters, as you are fighting the horde, smokers and hunters the same time as your trying to fight off the tank...yup, just about impossible.Impression:Intense...yes. Gut wrenching...yes. FUN...hmmm, I'm not sure. One of the great strengths of on-line Left 4 Dead was the co-op fighting style needed to get through the advanced and expert campaigns. Here in 'Survival', co-op is needed but somehow, after a battle that begins with about 1 minute of 'easy', all chaos breaks-out. And because your being attacked from all side by ALL types of infected, the co-op gaming style, that made the regular L4D sooo enjoyable, is gone; gone because at this point, it becomes a game of personal survival, rather than the group...and that's the real shortcoming of this update.And finally, I could play the regular on-line L4D for hours and never (well almost never) get tired. But with this game, I found that not only did it take quite a lot of time/effort to strategically set up gas cans, propane tanks etc. in the area you want to TRY to defend, but also, that after 3 or 4 tries I was frustrated, weary and eager to return to the regular game.I must admit, in fairness, that I've never been a great fan of time based/get the highest score, type games, so I'm probably a little prejudiced. I'll continue to 'give this a go' for a while; maybe it'll turn out to be a great game. But somehow, I think I'd have liked a new regular campaign map better.R.N. (cujo)

This is a magnificent DVDThis all Mozart concert was recorded live in Graz, Austria and features mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt with the Concentus Musicus Wien.The first half of the disc features Bartoli singing some of Mozart's lesser know arias. Songs that were intended to replace arias in some of his or other opera writers works. This was sometimes done to feature a particular singer whose voice was not suited to the original work. My favorite piece by Bartoli is the lilting 3/4 time "Un moto di gioia mi I sento" ( intended to be used in "Le Nozze di Figaro")The second half of the concert is Mozart's Symphony #38 "Prague". This, I believe, is the only DVD recording of this work and is played beautifully by the orchestra. The third movement is truly outstanding.However, as beautiful as Bartoli sings and as expressively as Harnoncourt conducts, the truly outstanding individual talents shown on this DVD are really brought together by the director, Brian Large; his expertise has resulted in a product of superior quality . The great camera work and film editing has captured many appealing, animated moments by both performers. (especially of Harnoncourt directing the "Prague") Also, the switching of the cameras to the proper instrument is done with impeccable timing and great effect.In addition to the DVD, there is an informative booklet that goes to some length to explain the reason some of these aria were written, and as well, gives some insight as to what was going on in Mozart's life at the time. Also, there is an extra segment on this disc which documents how much time and work was involved with setting up the lights, cameras and stage for the filming of this live recording.The DVD has a good menu and you can select which scene you wish to watch: The only niggling complaint would be that the only subtitle language choice is that of English. I must admit, once I get familiar with a work, I like to follow it in the language it is sung in. ( in this case Italian)All in all, a classical DVD of the highest quality. Highly recommended.

"The Road" is a work of fiction by Cormac McCarthy.*SPOILER*This is a story of a man and his young son (maybe 9 or 10 yrs old) and the relationship between them as they struggle to survive. Because survival here is not usually by the fittest, but more likely by the most vigilant, the most ruthless and occasionally, by the luckiest.The world is in an ever deepening apocalyptic winter that occurred after an event that happened several years previously. So the goal is to go south (to where it is hopefully warmer) and find/steal any previously unfound food/clothing and try to find somewhere safe to spend the long black nights. But paramount to things mentioned in the last sentence, is to avoid the 'bad guys'...not easily done.*End SPOILER*A pleasant book?...decidedly not! In fact, this is one of the darkest books I've ever read...the ongoing bleakness, the overwhelming sense of hopelessness and futility seems to weigh heavily on the reader as he gets deeper and deeper into this living nightmare.However, towards the end of the book I became acutely aware of the loving, trusting relationship between father and son. I probably should had perceived this relationship earlier on but I was 'blinded' to it for much of the book because of the many repetitive one or two word conversations they shared throughout much of the novel. In fact, it is hard to grasp the 'sensitivity' of the relationship between the two (both who BTW, remain nameless throughout) while actually reading this story. It wasn't until after I finished the book and reflected on the dire situation that confronted them on a seemingly moment to moment basis, that I began to develop a sense of appreciation for what McCarthy has written here.Conclusion:A bleak, dark novel...definitely not for everyone's tastes, but it does have some reflective moments in it. And maybe the human spirit to endure and survive, to never give up, has never been better demonstrated. 4 1/2 Stars

Simply some of the best fantasy I've read in ages!I discovered this book almost by accident when I saw another reviewer recommending this work by Sean Russell. I must admit I'd never heard of this author or this series previously; but I'm glad I went ahead and purchased this book because it's a real gem.This tale has all the ingredients for great fantasy, that being an interesting storyline for the mandatory good verses evil plot line, creatures and characters with special talents, love, deceit, betrayal and a liberal sprinkling of magic scattered throughout this work. The character development is adequate and by about one third way through this book you have an assortment of people you love to love and even a few you love to hate.Fantasy has always been one of my favorite genre of books that I read for pleasure and this work contains some of the finest fantasy writing I've come across in a long time. What separates Russell from other writers in this field is the quality of the prose; there is a "polish" or a "refinement" to the storytelling that many other authors just never seem to obtain no matter how good or interesting their tale is. This work has an easy readability and when combined with its precise sense of pace, it makes this book hard to put down. To me, this novel fits comfortably into the upper echelon of fantasy books written by the likes of George Martin, "Ice and Fire" series, Steven Erikson, "The Malazan Book of the Fallen" saga, and Stephen Donaldson, "Thomas Covenant" series.The only niggling negative would be the lack of a map; it would have been so useful to try to pinpoint locales and gauge distances.All in all, a great story accompanied with remarkable storytelling skills and writing techniques; If you love great fantasy you'll want to read this book. Highly recommended! 5 Stars (more if I could)

What a disappointing book!I hate to say it, but I must...this is a novel that will appeal almost only to adolescent, teenage girls.I purchased this novel after hearing all the hype around the latest book ('Breaking Dawn'); so I decided to start reading this series at the beginning, with book 1, 'Twilight'. The book had an intriguing cover and the short preface gave me some initial hope of a great story, however, after about 20+ pages, I started to get an uneasy feeling that this book was not written with any intention of appealing to an adult audience.*SPOILER* to follow...The story tells of the developing relationship between Bella (a 17 year old girl) and Edward, a 100+ year old vampire (who is handsome beyond belief and appears physically to be in his late teens).*END SPOILER*My concerns for this book...1.)The book features one line dialogues and inane conversations; page after page of fill and fluff. The link-up between the two main protagonist was dragged out over an incredibly boring 200+ pages.2.)Bella's and Edward's characters are about as flat and one-dimensional as any I've ever encountered in a novel. Furthermore, Edward's personality and his desire for Bella is totally unrealistic and unbelievable, given his true age and experience.3.)The writing is uninspiring and repetitive, as witnessed by Bella's unending swooning over Edward's good looks, and then Edward has frequent mood fluctuations (varying from outright adoration, annoyance, irritated or anger) whenever he has any dialogue with Bella.4.)The one, tense and extremely intriguing event (hinted at in the preface) that happened between pages 380 and 450, was resolved without explanation...almost like magic; the reader not really informed as to what had occurred to solve this life threatening situation. Then the novel slips once again back into a state of perpetual, rambling boredom right to the end.Conclusion:A good story that is well written and expertly told, will usually transcend most age groups and the expected differences in maturity levels; this book, emphatically does not.If your a 13-17 year old girl, you'll probably love this book...from the sales, it appears someone likes this novel. The level of writing and dialogue is very much geared to an adolescent female age group.Anyone else looking for a good fantasy tale should look elsewhere.1 StarR.NicholsonP.S. I find it unimaginable that they would think of making this into a movie. Other than the brief 'encounter' mid-book, there is absolutely nothing to hold your interest for 2+ hours in a theater.

"Lyonesse: Suldrun's Garden" is the first book in the 'Lyonesse' trilogy by author Jack Vance. This Kindle e-edition is a 756 Kb download.Background:I had just finished reading "Songs of the Dying Earth...a compilation of 22 short stories by various authors that used the settings from the world of Jack Vance's "Tales of the Dying Earth" collection. It seemed obvious that if many different fantasy/sci-fi writers would use the settings from someone else's book for their own work, then this was a testament of respect for the original author. With this in mind I decided I'd like to read some of Mr Vance's works to get a sense of his writing style for myself. Ultimately, I chose the "Lyonesse" trilogy because I tend to enjoy a three book series (especially if they're good) and also I find that short stories can be a real hit or miss scenario.Impression: (some SPOILER material to follow)I had mixed feelings for this work. There were moments that held me enthralled with the story, such as tales of Shimrod and then of Aillas; well written, exciting and well paced with action and intrigue. But there were other areas that almost seemed like a fairy-tale, with story telling so simple and bland that I thought it was written for children. For instance, much of Dhurn's (son of Aillas) tale seemed almost very young adult in quality...there were moments where I got the feelings that the intended audience was for one much younger than myself. This was in stark contrast to some of the dark goings-on found in other areas of the book.And also with Suldrun's tale...we follow her from birth to early teens. I always had the feeling that something ominous or crucial was about to happen, but it never did until towards the very end of her story. And even more strange, about one half way through the book, Suldrun, for whom the book is named, is quietly and without fanfare, written out of the story.Often there was significant build-up to several important meetings and events that were about to occur, but then it (the event) was over, seemly to be cut short on descriptions and details; details that might have given the reader more insight into the cause and effects of some of these actions. And this was important because some of these happenings would have an impact on what would transpire in the future. I also felt these 'abrupt' endings, resulted in the loss of potential character development. Obviously a subjective opinion, but this is how I felt about several areas of this novel.Maps:There are three maps giving (all rather poorly rendered by the Kindle App)1.) a general overview of the 'Elder Isles' with territorial divisions and names.2.) a list of major towns/citys within the land mass3.) an enlarged view of area around Lyonesse Town and surrounding forest.Conclusion:I really liked this book...at times! It had potential and an intriguing story line, but the quality of story telling seemed to change from one area to the next. There were parts where I could hardly wait to turn the page and others I was tempted to skim...even a couple of times I could have easily stopped reading this book altogether. Overall this work was just good enough to continue on with the rest of the trilogy. 2 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

I purchased this unit as a replacement for a Sportster 5 Sirius Satellite radio that recently ceased functioning.This unit is smaller, more compact and in fact, more attractive than the Sportster 5.It has all the features I want on a Satellite radio, that being a fully functioning remote, 44 minutes of replay, game day alert (will automatically tune in your favorite sports teams broadcasts) and save your favorite songs into memory (you can program this unit to alert you to when any of up to 20 favorite songs are being played on any of the 100+ channels of commercial free music.About the only negative on this unit is that the screen is somewhat smaller, making it a little more difficult to read than my old unit, however this is not a major detraction from this otherwise well made product.Conclusion:If you love satellite radio and the variety that Sirius provides in music, news, sports etc. then this is a unit that offers a lot towards fulfilling your car radio needs.5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

A truly wonderful piece of fiction.Dostoevsky's (1821-1881) classic work was written towards the end of his life (between 1879-1880). It is a tale of a dysfunctional Russian middle class family; the story follows significant events in the lives of the father (Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov) and his three sons (Dmitri, Ivan and Alexei).Although the first half of the story is slow to develop it is well written and easy to follow (maybe this is a trait of this era of Russian writers, I found Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' had the same qualities.) The latter half of the book was, in my opinion, much more dynamic and interesting to read.The translation of the work, by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, from Russian to English, is well done; subjectively, to me, it seemed to captivate many of the subtleties and nuances that I can only assume Dostoevsky wished to bring forth in his novel.However be forewarned, reading this novel is a true labor of love and a definitive exercise in perseverance. The book is 779 pages long and 'dense' with regards to the number of words per page. Some paragraphs go on for pages; some sentences can be difficult to follow because they are exceedingly long and punctuated with many commas. Also, Dostoevsky at times, uses his novel to expound (often, at some length) upon a few of his philosophical theories regarding such opposing forces as life/death, good/evil, and the existence (or not) of God.Conclusion:Many consider this one of the finest books ever written, and it may be so; this is obviously a very subjective opinion. I really enjoyed the book, especially the second half (beginning with Dmitri's tale). However, if your not an avid fan of Russian literature or if your simply reading it for pleasure then this book requires a degree of dedication to finish. But make no mistake about it, the quality is there, and if the story tweaks your fancy you'll be well rewarded by reading Dostoevsky's final masterpiece.R.Nicholson

A stunning presentation.This is the 1989 version of Verdi's Aida performed before a live audience at the Met in New York. It stars Placido Domingo as Radames, Dolora Zajick as Amneris and Aprile Millo as Aida. The orchestra is conducted by James Levine; the video under the direction of Brian Large. The sets were spectacular, immense; the costumes were well done and fairly represented the Egyptian era they were trying to portray.Placido was at his prime during this presentation, his voice vibrant and powerful. His portrayal of Radames perfectly balanced Millo's Aida, whose sweet voice was able to hold and control those exquisite soft high notes in her aria's and also in her duets with Domingo. Zajick (as Amneris) had some incredible aria's in the second half of this production.In addition to the singing, the acting was extremely well done; powerful, sincere and passionate. Emotional enough to have the audience giving enthusiastic applause and cheering almost before some of the acts ended; making the show wait until they stopped.This opera was deemed fit to win an Emmy in 1989 for "Outstanding Classical Program in the Preforming Arts". It's not hard to understand why. With this cast and this setting, it's an Aida for the ages! Highly recommended

An entertaining read.This novel by Arturo Perez-Reverte is set in 17th century Spain and is a tale of political intrigue of international proportions; a tale of single shot muskets, romance, sword fights, ambushes and unexpected friendships. Told through the eyes of a young boy, it captures the era around the reign of Philip the 4th; a period when Spain was at the height of its powers (although the evidence of early decay was starting to seep in through some of the cracks).The book is easy to read (even with the translated text), has an good pace and an interesting story line. There are sprinklings of poetry here and there that are appropriate for the era and personages involved.I liked the book, and would recommend it without reservations. 5 Stars

A generally enjoyable DVD!Die Zauberflote, Mozart's last opera, performed on this disc by the Metropolitan Opera under the direction of James Levine.The cast features such stars as Kathleen Battle (Pamina), Fancisco Araiza (Tamino), Manfred Hemm (Papageno), Kurt Moll (Sarasto), and Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. Brian Large, who has vast experience with opera, directs this major work.This opera showcases the voice and acting skills of Kathleen Battle: she is brilliant, beautiful and with a voice that could only be described as a gift. Also noteworthy are the exquisite vocals by Luciana Serra as the Queen of the Night. However, it is Manfred Hemm as Papageno who steals the spotlight: from beginning to end, his funny interpretation of his character (accompanied by his great voice) carries this work to its fitting conclusion.The only negative comment (thus the loss of one star) was the surreal quality of the sets. Frankly, I thought they were ugly and if anything, detracted from an otherwise stellar performance. Also the overture featured, I felt, a little too much of James Levine: surely, some more shots of the orchestra could have been inserted here somewhere.While The Magic Flute is not my favorite opera by Mozart, this is, all things being considered, an enjoyable performance. Musically, I could honestly recommend this DVD.

I've decided in this review, to do all 3 books in the Tawny Man trilogy, (that being Fool's Errand, Golden Fool and Fool's Fate), as they are intricately connected (as you might expect) in the main characters, story line and writing quality.I enjoyed this series but with some minor reservations... let me explainThe pros:The prose and story telling is of the highest quality with detailed description of persons, places and things. There is great character development throughout the entire trilogy; people you really like (or dislike) with a passion, and as with most fantasy novels, there is some magic and characters or creatures with special talents. The plot, although slow to develop, is interesting and intriguing; it grips you, making you eager to get back to these novels whenever you can. The writing itself has a nice, easy to read flow to it and follows in a logical sequence.The cons: Two niggling concerns: (and loss of star)1.)The main character; (Fitz) is best described as a reluctant hero with an overwhelming sense of guilt and continual self depreciation. In Fitz's opinion, everything that has ever gone wrong in this story can be traced back to the way he handled a situation in the past; and he is FOREVER agonizing about these thoughts (what he might have done (or not done) different... etc.) Needless to say, three novels of this, and this character trait starts to wear a little thin.2.)Lack of action; I realize a great novel does not have to have "action", however having said that, I've always liked my fantasy novels to have a fair amount of "action" with some battles or combat (large scale or small). That is not to say this series has no action, because it does, but somehow I wanted more. The few skirmishes seemed so far apart, and I must admit this was somewhat disappointing.Although it may appear that my "concerns" mentioned above appear huge, such is not the case. This is a deep, rich fantasy series of epic proportions; well written and detailed, but just misses the mark of true greatness because of the shortcomings mentioned above. 4 stars.

This device is a small attachment for any of the Navigon 2100, 5100 or 7100 series GPS.For some reason, Navigon decided to place the charger receptacle on the BOTTOM (facing downwards) of their units. This makes little difference if you use the windshield suction cup to hold and display your unit. However, if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection, as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down. This device, when attached to the GPS, allows allows the charger cord to come in from the side, eliminating any acute bending of the cord.Conclusion:A helpful device for all Navigon GPS units; intend for those users who wish to have their unit mounted to the dash. 5 Stars

A somewhat disappointing book!I purchased this book because the cover stated that it was the winner of a major literary award; in addition to that, were the multiple glowing reviews on the inside and back covers.While I have no problem with an adventure story about a dirigible and its crew with a somewhat improbable plot, but what I strongly object to in this book is the repeatedly, totally unbelievable events and escapes made possible by conveniently finding something or someone to save the day at the last moment (Almost like a James Bond movie). Add to this the inane conversations between Matt and Kate and you have a book that could have been great but instead struggles to lift itself above mediocrity. Although a completely different story, it reminds me of the same disappointment, the same letdown, I felt about "Inkheart", by Cornelia Funke.Now, having read this book, I find it difficult to understand how this book could win a Governor General's Award (Canada). And then there are the beaming tributes; for example, "This book is a must read" says the Montreal Gazette... Well, I guess it's just a matter of personal taste and preferences: just not my tastes and preferences.All in all, a book that would probably entertain the older child age group; other readers would be well advised to look elsewhere.

Another marvelous look at Mikhail Baryshnikov.This is a DVD produced by Twyla Tharp featuring a more relaxed performance by Baryshnikov. The program begins with an segmented introduction that continues on in between the three, featured dance routines. The female leads are partners Deidre Carberry in 'The Little Ballet', Elaine Kudo in 'The Sinatra Suite' and finally the corp de ballet of the American Ballet Theatre in 'Push Comes to Shove'.This DVD features a Mikhail Baryshnikov that is somewhat older (but he really doesn't look or dance like it). The lifts and glides, the incredible sense of timing with his partners are done with such ease and grace...no effort at all...surely anyone could do that, couldn't they? Well, no most of us couldn't; what we are witnessing is Baryshnikov's athleticism, skill and balance that have endured, if not gotten better, through the years.A comment on a few likes and dislikes about this disc...1.)'The Little Ballet' starts off with a waltz where Baryshnikov and his partner, Deidre Carberry, only touch with their forearms; this is amazingly beautiful and erotic. The music and dance that follows just flows with a nature pace and sensitivity. I makes me wonder if dancers of this quality don't fall in love with their partners while performing these exquisite routines (well, at least for a few minutes anyway).2.)My favorite work on this disc in the tribute to Sinatra featuring Baryshnikov and sultry looking Elaine Kudo. Using Sinatra's songs, this elegant couple do waltzes, modern dance and even a 'gangster and moll' routine. Baryshnikov finishes the set with a slow sensitive solo to 'One for My Baby' (It's quarter to three). I'm sure Mr. Sinatra would have been pleased to see his songs use as a setting for the dance skills of Mr. Baryshnikov.3.)The third and final piece was 'Push Comes to Shove'. This work features Mikhail with the corp; it is an attempt to show some humor in dance, and while the choreography is excellent, they unfortunately decided to use a laugh track to simulate audience laughter. I assume, that because there was no 'live' audience, they felt the need to put some laughter in at the appropriate spots, however this somewhat diminished the effect of this routine because the laughter was so obviously artificial.Conclusion:Mikhail Baryshnikov doing what only he can do, along with some exquisitely talented and beautiful partners. To be able to dance with such ease, grace and skill almost seems unfair to the rest of us mere mortals. 4 1/2 Stars (1/2 Star off for the canned laugh track)R.Nicholson

This DVD is a gem!GREAT music by Donizetti; tunes that I'm continually humming to myself (because I can't sing) throughout the day. Wonderful singers: Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu in the starring roles, however the show is stolen by the performance of Simone Alaimo who does a superlative job as Doctorre Dulcamara. Talk about getting into a role: he holds absolutely nothing back....magnificent! Just see him in the duet &quot;Quanto amore&quot; with Angela Gheorghiu and you'll see what I mean. It'll leave you breathless.As far as the overall production, I have seen a couple operas staged (on DVD) from the Opera National de Lyon and have not been disappointed in the results. They seem to have the knack of producing good audio and pleasing sets that are easy to look at and complement the people on stage.Brian Large handles the video and editing so you know you're going to get great camera angles.My only negative comments(and thus the loss of one star) about this otherwise wonderful production is that first, Roberto Alagna's voice came through my stereo system slightly tinny at times(maybe my system and/or the fact that I like my opera fairly loud) and second, that I could swear someone hits the wrong note at the very end of the opera.All in all an enjoyable show that I've listened to many times and just never get tired of. Absolutely worth getting.

'Home Sweet Home - My Canadian Album' by Mordecai Richler is just that, an album of literary snapshots of our unique land. Almost any Canadian will easily recognize these small vignettes, and yet at the same time, will probably be flooded with a host of interesting memories.To me, a Canadian, the fact that this book was published some time ago in 1984, only seems to enhance the images that Richler so beautifully draws with his prose. His writings are filled not only with casual (but often caustic), realistic observations, but also of course, with his candid and refreshing wit. Not many writers have the ability to make me laugh out loud...Richler does.The book is a series of short chapters describing many real-life situations that he (Richler) encountered in his travels across Canada and the U.S., both as a boy and then later, as a grown-up in Montreal. To mention a few of the subjects touched upon...we see glimpses of Expo 67, the birth and death of the Montreal Expo baseball team, the separatist political group (Parti Quebecois) and of course his beloved hockey team, the Montreal Canadiens. There are many more, each with its own special reflection on some event or time within the framework of Canada dating from WWII to the 1990's. It's like reading a diary; a very interesting, historical diary.Conclusion:A nostalgic look at Canada's recent past; told through the eyes of someone who was there when it happened. A book filled with subjective, yet honest observations and sprinkled with a wry humor...resulting in a collection of short treatises that make me ache for the 'good old days', even more than I realized. Thanks for this Mr Richler.Ray NicholsonP.S.Mordecai Richler was one of my favorite Canadian writers; he passed away at a youngish 70 in 2001. I loved his column in the 'National Post' (Toronto); my favorite book of his...'Barney's Version', published in 1997.

This book is classic Mordecai Richler:His main character, Joshua, is a Montreal Jew who is opinionated, cynical and comes from a seedy background: and yet, is able to survive, become successful and marries into a well-off family that have their own set of closet skeletons. The story has many interesting twists and emotions vary from the serious, sad or sometimes, to the very funny. Like many of Richler's characters, there is a gutsy determination, a sense of purposeful indignation about Joshua that you can admire and identify with.The novel is well written and easy to read and uses sporadic explicit language.This is sure to please anyone who has enjoyed other Richler books such as "Barney's Version" or "St. Urbain's Horseman". A recommended read!

A spectacular, stunning Giselle!This DVD version of Giselle was recorded live at La Scala. It stars Alessandra Ferri as Giselle and Massimo Murru as Albrecht: both give stellar performances.There are the many wonderful moments in this production: I'll touch briefly on a few....-Ferri is breathtaking in her interpretation of the main character: her dancing is vibrant and her acting and expressions capture the essence of the naive, love-stuck young girl in Act I, and then, as the protective Wili for the final Act.-The costumes and sets are beautiful. For example, in the village scenes of Act I, the corps de ballet wear gold and rust colored outfits , while Ferri,as Giselle, wears a sky blue skirt with a navy blue top that makes her stand out from the other performers. She is simply stunning, your eye cannot help but be drawn to her in this setting.-There is something about ballet done before a live audience. This "Giselle" is so enchanting, you could really appreciate the reaction of the audience: enthusiastically clapping and cheering, almost before some of the scenes ended.- And last but not least, there is the music by Adolphe Adams: melodies so beautiful and haunting that when combined with the choreography for this work, have resulted in a ballet that has become an ageless masterpiece. What a thrill it must have been to have been there that night.Technically, I thought the cameras were well placed and film editing was, with one or two exceptions, well done. The DVD has superb video and audio, and the menu allows you to go to any scene you like.All in all a recording of Giselle of the highest quality.P.S. If I had to pick a Giselle to buy, this is the DVD I'd recommend. The other notable offering of Giselle is the movie version by the American Ballet Theatre starring Carla Fracci and Eric Bruhn. The dancing is excellent in the ABT production but the film editing is poor. (to the point of distraction at times)

This disc has a great variety of classical music: opera, concerts, sonatas and ballet: i.e. something for everyone and every taste.It features excerpts from many international stars such as Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Bryn Terfel, Cecelia Bartoli, Leontyne Price, Anne Sophie Mutter, Rudolph Nureyev just to mention a few. Some of the composers and their (works) are Mozart (Le Nozze Di Figaro and Die Zauberflote), Bizet (Carmen), Tchaikovsky (Swan Lake and the Nutcracker) and Verdi (La Traviata, Rigoletto and Il Trovatore ).All the selections are short and show just enough of a scene to give a hint as to what is to follow.All in all, an enjoyable DVD. Probably an ideal starting point for anyone looking to get into classical music or ballet

Another excellent DVD from Euroarts.This disc contains the Berlin Philharmonic's annual European Concert for May 1 ( the date commemorating the founding of the orchestra many years ago); the 2006 concert site is Prague, Czech. The conductor and pianist for this performance is Daniel Barenboim and the guest soloist is Radek Baborak playing the French Horn. The entire concert features Mozart; there are two symphonies, (the 35th [the Haffner] and the 36th [the Linz]) bracketing the Piano concerto No. 22 and the Horn concerto No. 1The concert took place in the Estates Theatre, Prague; a delightful horseshoe shaped theater featuring its huge chandelier, ornate domed ceiling and intricate decorative work ornamenting the five layers of loge boxes surrounding the perimeter of the main floor. Simply a magnificent structure!An all Mozart concert is fitting for Prague because it was this city that embraced his music right from the beginning; his home town of Salzburg, often was less enthusiastic about his musical offerings. In fact, so popular was Prague with Mozart, that the first performance of "Don Giovanni" was performed at the Estates Theatre in 1787.As with all previous Euroarts DVDs of the BPO's May 1st concerts, there remain certain constants over the years; that being, great music (of course), exceptional filming and editing, wonderful audio and above all, some of the greatest musical compositions played by arguably one of the best orchestras in the world, featuring world class conductors and guest soloists; this years DVD is no exception.Highlights of the disc; (obviously a personal choice)1.)Barenboim playing of the Allegro (rondo) 3rd movement of the Piano Concerto No. 22; (featured in the movie "Amadeus"); played with great sensitivity and emotion not only by Barenboim but the entire orchestra as well.2.)The entire Horn Concerto with Radek Baborak as guest soloist; a wonderfully happy melody played to perfection and with great cheer.In addition to the music on the disc, there is also a video clip about some of the history and musical events surrounding Prague; a short but interesting bonus on this DVD.A wonderful DVD; a performance and recording of the highest standards. 5 Stars.

A stunning DVD!The concert was recorded live at the Herodes Atticus Odeon in Athens, Greece on May 1, 2004, and features the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) under the leadership of Sir Simon Rattle. The works performed are Brahms' piano concerto No.1 ( with Daniel Barenboim at the piano) and the piano quartet No.1 (arranged for orchestra, by Arnold Schoenberg).There are many positives to this performance... to mention a few-the video: the technical team has produced a superior product. Multiple, great camera angles and the switching/editing was done with impeccable timing and great effect. Also the setting is unique, with this ancient amphitheater at the foot of the Acropolis providing an impressive visual backdrop.-the audio: simply dazzling acoustics! (even with the occasional bird heard chirping in the background during some of the quieter moments)Performance highlights:-the third movement of the Piano Concerto, (Rondo, allegro non troppo).What a wonderful meld between Daniel Barenboim, Simon Rattle and the BPO; the piano is played with pace, force and enthusiasum by Barenboim, while Rattle is having the time of his life (you'll understand what I mean when you see this DVD) conducting the BPO.-the fourth movement of the Piano Quartet (rondo alla zingarese, presto) arranged for orchestra.If ever a piece of music was written to put an orchestra through it's paces, this was it. Most of the 8-9 minutes of this moverment are played at a breakneck speed, that Rattle and the BPO handle with considerable aplomb. Simply breathtaking to watch and listen to!This is one of those performances that having a video to accompany the audio adds so much to the enjoyment of the entire package. If you like Brahms then you will want this in your video/audio collection. Highly recommended.

The title sums up my feelings for this game.There is no let up in the hordes of undead coming at you from the moment you step into a new area until all enemies are vanquished (at which point an exit is made available to you to do it all over again on a new level); this basically is the entire game. On each level (once cleared) you can go hunting for ammo, shields, power ups etc. After two levels of this I was bored, bored, bored and couldn't even bother to continue with this game.On the positive side, the graphics were very good and the atmosphere had a spooky ambiance to it; however, these attributes were not enough to make me want to keep going.Gamers that liked the original, old fashioned, run and gun FPSs will probably like this game. However, I've gotten to the point in my FPS gaming of wanting a plot or at least some situations that require some thought; challenges that make you consider your surroundings, skills and weaponry etc. instead of just blindly plodding on while continually squeezing the trigger.All in all, a game that is the new definition of the word "tedious"; it offers nothing more than monotonous, endless killing and little else. 2 Stars.

This DVD features Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet performed at the La Scala in 2000. It has all the ingredients to make a superbly entertaining video with Alessandra Ferri and Angel Corella starring as the principal dancers. It also has great scenery, fine costumes and better than average filming and editing.However, to me, it has one glaring drawback, that being the music (not the way the music was played for this performance but rather the composition itself)...let me explainTo have great ballet, I associate thoughts of outstanding dancing and beautiful music that go together; things that compliment one another, things that seem to be made for and could simply not exist without the other. Such is not the case here (with the exception of the two pas de deux mentioned below).To be honest, I'm not sure this music is meant for ballet. It's got a symphonic quality that is heavy and ponderous; it's just not "pretty"! For instance, in Act I there is a lot of festive activities going on featuring the corps de ballet: they are happy and smiling but its hard to understand why, with the decidedly cheerless music that they must dance to. Even the audience seemed to feel restrained during this entire presentation: their applause consistently subdued and short.On the plus side there is Ferri and Corella!Ferri seems to have blossomed into one of the better actress/ballerinas of our time; her facial expressions and body language compliment her gifted dancing abilities. She and Corella carry this performance from beginning to end; they have two outstanding Pas de deux during this ballet, that being the "Balcony Scene" at the end of Act I and then the "Bedroom Scene" starting Act III. Other than these two magnificent dances, Sir Kenneth Macmillan (the choreographer) has done about as much as possible to "fill in " the rest of music with a ballet performance. Even under ideal circumstances it must be an arduous task to try to choreograph dance to music that, dare I say, is a challenge to become enthusiast about; one can only compliment him in completing this difficult endeavour.I guess it all boils down to whether you like Prokofiev's music (and obviously this is a purely personal, subjective opinion); nonetheless, I give this a 5 star presentation in all things but the music. If not for Ferri and Corella I probably would have given this disc a 1 or 2 star rating; in fact, if not for Ferri and Corella I'd have regretted buying this DVD at all. However, that being said, the two Pas de Deux ARE worth the price of this disc and the menu allows you the option to go directly to these scenes should you wish.

Another historical gem from Kultur; this DVD features Mikhail Baryshnikov's 1976 American debut at the Wolf Trap Theatre.Because this was 'live recording', the disc is quite short; it is only 50 minutes long. However it is filled with an exhibition of talent and grace that could only be Baryshnikov. There are four Baryshnikov pieces featured on this DVD; two Pas de Deuxs with Gesley Kirkland, one with Marianna Tcherkassky and a solo dance.This disc features Baryshnikov at is prime, and while watching him, you begin to understand the fervor around his arrival to the west. His spins and leaps appear to happen in slow motion...virtually effortless; his 'hang-time' could easily be compared to that of basketball's Michael Jordan.The only minor concern about this disc is from a technical point of view; age has made the film somewhat grainy and the sound is in mono. However this is a small price to pay to be able to see one of the best, at his best.One other observations, when watching Gesley Kirkland in the two dances she performed with Mikhail I noticed two things, first, that she appeared somewhat shaky (nervous perhaps?...who could blame her) and second, how incredible thin she was (every bone, every muscle defined). Then during the credits there was a note, written by Gesley, warning young girls of the the dangers of anorexia and how it could affect their performance in ballet. I thought this was an incredibly thoughtful, honest and revealing gesture on her part.Conclusion:An archival treasure... featuring Mikhail Baryshnikov's at his American debut. A must have for any ballet lover. 5 Stars

A wonderful DVD!This disc is a collection of short ballet vignettes that pays tribute to the Kirov dancers and the magnificent choreography they have been given to perform. The dances range from the traditional to more modern pieces and it is this variety that gives the entire presentation a well rounded, balanced feel ; there is something here for all tastes.Although all the works on this disc have some special qualities, the following are some of my favorites:-"Chopiniana" , featuring Altynai Asylmuratova, Konstantin Zaklinsky and the corps de ballet; I wonder if Chopin would have ever believed his music would be the accompaniment for this serene, beautiful dance.-The surreal, starry setting for Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings" seemed a perfect backdrop for Yelena Yevteeva and Eldar Aliev to perform their sensual, almost contortionistic dance.-"Le Corsaire" features Faroukh Ruzimatov with, as always, his unbelieveable leaps and expressive dancing.Highlight of the disc:...Without question, the "The Fairy Doll" with Larissa Lezhnina as the beautiful doll, pursued relentlessly by the two love struck mime-clowns. (performed by Dmitry Gruzdev and Yaroslav Fadayev) This is the comical side of ballet at it's best: the two guys are magnificent as they attempt to outdo each other as they vie for her affection. All three participants of this work show grace, balance, athleticism and an unbelieveable sense of timing that make this difficult performance look simplistically easy.All in all, a DVD featuring great choreography and top quality dancing by the Kirov. Highly recommended!

A good (albeit short) fantasy read!This is another sordid tale from Steven Erikson involving Bauchelain, Korbal Broach and Emancipor Reese: We'd last left our despicable trio of heroes on their urgent (and expedient) departure from the town of "Lamentable Moll". Now we pick up their trail near the town of "Quaint"; the town and its "kindly" king are soon to know the mayhem and devastation that can result from a visit from these three traveling companions.Again, as with the first book ( Blood Follows), it's Erikson wonderful use of descriptive prose that has that ability to take you into the places described in the book; it's that dank, foreboding atmosphere, that edgy feeling for ones safe being that makes this novella a pleasure to read. And yet, despite that gravity of the overall story, there is an element of humour sprinkled throughout this work; even a couple of occasions that made me laugh out loud.All in all, an enjoyable story, told with typical Erikson literary style and skill. If you liked " The Malazan Book of the Fallen" series or "Blood Follows" you'll enjoy this.

If you are an outdoor enthusiast who loves to take pictures but deplore the weight and size of most conventional digital or 35mm cameras, then this camera is the one for you.Weighing only 4.6 ounces and smaller than a pkg of cigarettes this little beauty has a case that will attach to your belt and allow you complete freedom of motion.Technically, a marvel: 3.2mpx plus 3x optical zoom with no lens to retract or extend ( all this is done WITHIN the camera !!!) and sharp quality pictures.Negatively, the software could be better and the camera is expensive. This is the classic example of the old cliche: you get what you pay for.

'Across the Face of the World' is the first book in a trilogy by Russell Kirkpatrick.I picked this book up in my local library while browsing for something 'fantasy' to read. The cover really intrigued me...five riders on horseback, set against a huge full moon...so I decided to try it.I must admit to some concerns after I got home and found several reviewers had given it a rather low rating. However I decided to give it a chance...with the result that I really liked this book...it had many qualities that made it an exceptionally good adventure (with a touch of fantasy thrown in).First and foremost, this is the tale of Leith and the circumstances that turn his quiet world upside down...thus beginning the grand quest (the book title is very appropriate). But unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn't find the story telling dragged out and boring. Granted, there was quiet times between 'events', however, I found these moments very interesting as they were used to develop many of the characters. And at the same time, they gave a lot of significant detail and background on the land (which is huge) and its inhabitants (of which there are many and varied).Also there are several wonderful and extremely detailed maps...very useful in following the exploits of our heroes. If only more authors would be so kind as to include maps for their world building tales I'd be very happy.In addition, there is a useful glossary at the back of the book to explain many unusual places, locales and groups etc.About the only complaint I have with the story is at campsites, where the travelers get into telling prolonged tales of the lore of the land (regarding Gods and their world building etc.). These diversions seemed to me to be less important than the main story, adding length to an already fairly long book (671 pages). However this is a minor concern when discussing this terrific, epic tale.Conclusion:The beginning of a epic and noble quest. Well written with pacing that I would describe as being close to perfect. I look forward to book II. 4 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

Despite some of the negative connotations suggested by the title of this review, this is still one of my favorite ballets on DVD.This is the movie of Adolphe Adam's Giselle, performed by the American Ballet Theatre. The choreography is by David Blair (after Perrot and Corelli). The principal dancers are Carla Fracci as Giselle and Erik Bruhn as Albrecht. The sets and costumes are beautiful and fairly portray the era they are meant to represent.Fracci is a superb dancer, but beyond this, she does a magnificent job in her emotional interpretation of the shy village girl who falls in love with the deceitful Albrecht and then later in Act II, (as a spirit, after her death) where she tries to save her lover from a watery grave at the hands of the vengeful Wili. This ballet has several different mood swings during the performance and Fracci accomplishes them all with surprising ease and elegance.I think this work has a lasting, timeless appeal because of the way that Adam's beautiful, haunting melodies are able to fit with the choreography that was provided for this ballet; the dance and music so superbly suited that this ballet has become ageless masterpiece.There is, unfortunately, a negative side to report (thus the loss of one star): as mentioned by almost all reviewers; some of the camera work and editing is hard to believe. Awkward close-ups, bumpy movie scenes taken from the backs of moving horses, highly magnified distorted shots: all detract from an otherwise outstanding performance. I cannot imagine what the producers or editors were thinking when they allowed this product to be the ultimate version for retail distribution. The cast must have been stunned to see this as the final cut.All in all, I can recommend this work because the music, the dancing and dancers in this ballet are of 5 star quality, however, the entire work is somewhat tarnished and diminished by its less than stellar camera work and editing.

A great read!This book, the first in a trilogy, turned out to be a well written fantasy that increasingly held my interest and by the end of it, left me eager to get to the next installment.The story revolves around the main character, Nazhuret (an interesting gnome like figure who is a lot more that he appears), his travels and his interaction with people and things he meets on his journey. There are several other important people in this tale and Macavoy does a stellar job in developing and introducing them into the plot.My only niggling complaint is a lack of a map of the area that would have let us to track the adventures of our hero.All in all, a good fantasy adventure and I'm looking forward to more.

An epic, stand alone fantasy story. (unlike most of the genre today, that seem to be published in the form of trilogies)After a somewhat slow beginning, this novel really picks up speed as it twists and turns its way to a very good conclusion. Like with most great fantasy writing, it has an abundance of magic, betrayals, creatures and people with special talents, love, unexpected friendships and above all an superb story line.I particularly liked the quality of Williams' prose in this book; it had that wonderful ability to sweep me into the story and keep me reading late into the night. Even though the novel was 800+ pages (paperback) I was sorry to see this extraordinary tale come to its end.Fantasy writing at its near best! 5 Stars.

A glorious 'Swan Lake'.This is a movie version of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' filmed in 1990. The performance is done by the Kirov Ballet and stars Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky.There are many positives regarding this DVD and only one minor negative...let me explain.The good:1.)This is one of the most beautiful renditions of this ballet I've ever been privileged to witness. Makhalina is a vision of loveliness and her skills, designating her as a prima ballerina are not hard to spot. Her spins and balance are flawless and her sense of timing with her partners is perfection itself.2.)Prince Siegfried is danced by Igor Zelensky (a dancer unknown to me prior to this performance). I felt his emotional response to his role was a little flat, BUT his spins and leaps (especially in his solo in Act II) were breath taking. The height and hang-time of his leaps were reminiscent of Baryshnikov in his prime; his leaping spins were exquisitely performed and fully completed.3.)The costumes and sets; simply sumptuous...enough said.4.)Camera work and position of shooting angles was, with a couple of exceptions, well done and resulted in visual pleasing presentation on this DVD.The Negative: (singular)Whether you like a recorded performance with or without a live audience is, of course, a personal preference. However, I felt this work sorely missed the spontaneous response that is only obtained with a live audience. Within this DVD you'll be witness to some of the most incredible skills in the form of a pas de deux or solo dance(s); but then, the music would end, the dancer(s) would hold their finishing poses and...nothing...just dead, disquieting silence. The camera then faded to black and the next scene started.It's hard to express in the written word how much the applause and the shouted 'bravos' add to a performance such as this. To me, the lack of audience response slightly diminished the overall effect of this otherwise magnificent ballet; I really felt that the performance was incomplete...something was missing. One can only wonder how it could not have affected the dancers themselves; hard to believe they'd not have 'given' more before a live audience.Conclusion:One of the finest productions of 'Swan Lake' I've seen, featuring two of the world's best dancers in their prime. It's unfortunate it wasn't recorded in front of a live audience; one can only speculate about an even better performance than in this movie version.5 Stars for the music, dancers, sets and costumes. 2 1/2 stars for the movie format.

Another great racing Sim from Bugbear/Empire games!As with the original FlatOut this is another high quality racing game that pits you against 7 other, hell-bent on winning, computer drivers. The game is also playable on the Internet against real opponents.The Pros:1.)The races are over a variety of terrain; there are race tracks, country roads, desert wastelands and towns.3.)The physics, as with the original game, are hard to believe! Sliding around corners, braking, crashes are very realistic.4.)Initially you only get to a limited number of tracks (and cars) to chose from until you finish at least in the top 3 places in a race, at which point new areas to race are opened up for you to try. You can use your winnings to upgrade your existing car or even buy a better vehicle if you have the funds. This is a great feature as it gives you incentive to finish high in the standings.5.)There are an assortment of bonus games and stunts that become available as you proceed through this game. These are fun but not the adrenalin pumping action of the real game.6.)The rag doll effect (driver flying through the windshield after an accident) is stopped immediately (thankfully) once the reset button is pressed.The Cons:1.)Although there are lots of racing venues, there seemed to be a lot of repetition of the race tracks that are used; every new racing area opened up, seemed to use the same tracks (with some slight variations) you'd finish is the last competition.2.)There as no info booklet or game sheet with the game (just the 5 discs); the manual is on the disc itself. Anyone playing FlatOut for the first time would be hard pressed to figure out the controls and especially to play in the first person perspective (and really the only way to play this race is from the drivers seat looking out the windshield) instead of 3rd person (from above and behind the car) which is the default.3.)Finally, my most serious complaint with this addition to the Flatout series is the lack of car damage (that effects drivability). With the original Flatout there was a "Pro" mode that allowed car damage to really affect performance; this is not the case with Flatout 2. If I had to name one major distraction from this game it would have to be that the major emphasis is on destroying objects and wrecking other drivers,(which were prominent in the original but not to the same degree) instead of skillful driving. And it's a shame really, because the AI of the computer drivers in really good and when combined with tract difficulty, makes winning a race against them a real challenge. I just think they went the wrong direction in this game and as a result I didn't enjoy this game quiet as much as the original.Suggestions:1.) To be competitive you really need a steering wheel with a gas/brake pedal feature.2.) Power and speed are important but so are handling and braking; so spend money on stabilizers, tires and shocks as well as the "power items".3.) Take some time at the beginning to set up the game to make it work right; go to the "Options" menu, set it to your likings (especially the "camera" setting which will allow you to set up a key on the keyboard so you can toggle through the different views to get the first person perspective) and you'll be rewarded with great driving competition.All in all, as good a racing Sim as I could ask for (with some minor reservations mentioned above). If you liked the original game, I'm sure you enjoy this one as well. 4-4 Stars.

An intriguing tale!This book, as stated in many other reviews, was difficult to put down; what seemed to start as a quiet, docile story turned out to be an intriguing investigative mystery.The novel is well written, has a good sense of pace and timing that add to an increasingly foreboding atmosphere. It also has that wonderful quality, usually found in a good book, of wanting to make you read one more chapter.All in all an good novel that keeps you coming back. Recommended...5 Stars.

'Goblin Quest' is the first in a fantasy series by Jim C. Hines.Our hero in this tale is Jig the goblin; a timid little guy that has a bit more to him than meets the eye. Jig is reluctantly commandeered into a quest by a group of overbearing 'adventurers'; the goal...to find the magical, but missing 'Rod of Creation'.The story is basically a romp through a maze of underground tunnels, all the while dodging hidden traps and fighting off unexpected attacks from hobgoblins, carrion worms, necromancers, tunnel cats and dragons.The positives for this book; it is an interesting tale that is well written and keeps your interest. Also, there are many genuinely funny moments sprinkled through this tale that had me chuckling out loud from time to time.Conclusion:This is fantasy-lite; it was fun and it was funny.This short book makes an enjoyable diversion; the entire novel could easily be read over a day of two.Although not specifically categorized as young adult I could easily see this book fitting into this classification.R. NicholsonP.S. Thanks to Paul Weiss for tweaking me onto this series with one of his excellent reviews.

A decent 2nd book in this trilogy.While I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first, I'd still recommend this series to any serious fantasy genre lover. Plenty of intrigue, betrayals, magical happenings and unexpected twists and turns.However, I have a couple of complaints for this book.1.)Most annoying, there is no map: this story covers a huge geographic area and a map would have added so much to the overall quality of this epic fantasy. Hard to believe that the author didn't include one.2.)Without giving spoilers, there was one locale in this book that seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to get through.All in all, a good second book in this interesting and well written fantasy series. Recommended. 4-4 1/2 Stars.

'The Black Company' by Glen Cook is a fantasy/adventure.I came across this title when I saw another reviewer mention it as an alternative to another book I was interested in. The book basically follows the main protagonist, Croaker, (a healer/fighter), as well as the men that make up this group of mercenary fighters (i.e. The Black Company).Although the story itself was interesting, the way in which it was told left something to be desired. The prose was made up of many short sentences, giving an almost staccato effect to the reading...in a word, choppy. It was difficult to get a sense of flow to the story because of this perceived disruptive style of writing.Each chapter had the company fighting a new and terrible rebel leader, which they'd defeat by the skin of their teeth. Near the end of each chapter a new and even more terrible leader would be mentioned; and low and behold this new enemy was the target for the next chapter. And despite the ever increasing devastating losses the enemy received, they seemed to be many times stronger for the next encounter in the ensuing chapter. This general scenario was repeated over and over.Also, at the beginning of each new chapter, I always had the feeling that I missed a section of the book; How did the 'Company' get from where they were at the end of last chapter, to this new place, at the start of this new chapter? Even the dialogue between characters at the start of a new chapter made me feel liked I'd skipped some pages.Anyone familiar with Steven Erikson's 'Malazan Book of the Fallen' series will immediately think of the group of fighters call 'the bridgeburners'; there are many similarities between the two groups, including mages, the usual soldiers' attitude regarding war, life, their superiors etc., the kibitzing, the practical jokes and of course, the genuine friendship and respect for one another when the chips are down.Conclusion:An interesting fantasy/adventure that I did enjoy...sort of. I just had the constant feeling while reading this book, that it needed a bit more 'polish' in prose and writing techniques that the author used. 2 1/2 StarsR.Nicholson

I've always had an interest in ballet so when I saw that this recording was available and then read the positive review by David Thierry, I decided to get this DVD. This turned out to be a case of 'one man's treasure is another...This performance was recorded in Sept 2007 in the Netherlands; it was dedicated as a tribute to fete choreographer van Manen's 75th birthday, by dancing some of his 'most celebrated ballets'.There were things I liked and disliked about this DVD...let me explainThe Pros:1.)The dancers could really dance! They were young, flexible and lithe; I could only wish to have been in such shape when I was that age.2.)There were segments of dance that were very pleasing to watch during this performance (the 'trois gnossiennes' and some moments of '5 Tangos' come to mind); unfortunately they were few and far between.The Cons:1.)The choreography. A lot of the dance (with some notable exceptions above) appeared wooden and stiff; it lacked a sense of flow and spontaneity. The general motif for the entire night's performance was that of classical ballet techniques blended with modern dance, and it just didn't fit; and maybe it didn't fit, because of...2.)The music! A selection of music as dreary and morose to dance to as I've ever heard...and this continued throughout the entire performance. Usually if you go to concert there may be something that doesn't please your ear; but rarely the entire evening's offerings. And there was nothing technically wrong with the playing of the music, but these particular classical offerings just did nothing to enhance one's enjoyment of the dancing. I can't image what would have persuaded the powers that be, who had the choice of music, to pick the audio selections they did.Shows like this always make me wonder how the dancers felt about performing to such music; surely something a little more 'pleasant' would help with one's 'dancing attitude'.Conclusion:To have a great dance performance you need three things: great choreography, great music and great dancers; a nights entertainment featuring just one out of three is really unacceptable.If, your a hard core van Manen fan you'll may really like this; I honestly did not.5 Stars for the incredibly skilled and talented dancers. 2 Stars for the overall DVDRay Nicholson

I liked this initial offering from Mitchell Graham.This is a story of magic rings and the people they align themselves with; resulting in the inevitable good vs. evil scenarios.This book is well written and easy to read; the characters are interesting and show some development throughout the novel. As with any good fantasy, this story has magic, some great battles, a splash of romance, friendship and betrayals, and above all, an interesting tale.The only minor negatives were1.) a somewhat slow and tedious midsection. (the beginning and end were well paced and interesting)2.) a map of questionable quality; poorly drawn and of limited use (more accurate detailing would have be extremely useful). Yet, having said that, I'm grateful for a map (any map), as some fantasy writers don't include one with their books, making the movements of their heroes so difficult to follow at times.A good first book to this series; a few minor shortcomings, but I'm looking forward to book 2.4 Stars

I purchased this unit about 1 week ago and I'm extremely please thus far.The Pros;-light weight, and easily portable; comes with a small, snug fitting pouch for travel storage/protection.-long battery life; still fully charged since my initial charge up.-fits comfortably into the hand and is not "slippery".-the three flexible, triple layered "floating" heads give a great shave...close and smooth; as good as I could have hope for.-shaving head is washable while on the razor.The cons;-only one really, that being that the entire shaving head doesn't separate from the unit (for cleaning purposes)as with some previous models; instead it has a fliptop (like a cap on a ketchup bottle). Although there is nothing specifically wrong with this, it does appear to be somewhat "fragile" to say the least. (one accidental knock or mishap and its easy to conceive the shaving head being knocked askew.All in all, a very good shaver.

I'd first seen this performance on CBC TV(Canada) in 2001 and immediately knew I was watching something special.On this DVD one gets to see and hear not only two great virtuosos in what must be their absolute singing prime, but also two incredible actors who obvious absolutely love what they are doing: And if that wasn't enough you get to listen to a magnificent orchestra who has a conductor (Myung-Whun Chung)with impeccable timing. Also the camera work and film editing is wonderfully done (Brian Large): just the right facial expression, just the right cut to the next camera for the most appropriate view: just the right angle to see the cello player come in on a certain note to accompanying the vocalist.I would like to add that this has, without a doubt, become my favorite opera DVD: and Donizetti's "Quanto amore" from the Elixer of Love is my favorite piece. Although there are several others that are truly wonderful ("madamina", "La ci darem la mano" and "Pa-pa-pa" just to mention a few)It is the definitive mix of Singer-Conductor-Orchestra blending together to become an indivisible, single entity.This performance is magic, just magic! What a thrill it must have been to have witnessed live; Too bad there wasn't more.

I'd first seen this performance on CBC TV(Canada) in 2001 and immediately knew I was watching something special. Having purchased and just watched the DVD two things become abundantly clear. First, it's even better than I remembered and second, this recording makes it so obviously clear how much more an excellent DVD gives the viewer, compared to an equally excellent, but visually lacking, CD.On this DVD one gets to see and hear not only two great virtuosos in what must be their absolute singing prime, but also two incredible actors who obvious absolutely love what they are doing: And if that wasn't enough you get to listen to a magnificent orchestra who has a conductor with impeccable timing.

Revised review Dec 02/08. (see P.P.S.)Let me start off by saying that Giselle is my favorite ballet; I love the story, the music and the dance.This performance was recorded in 2006 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Gardens, London and stars Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobberg in the principal roles.This is probably the best danced and finest interpretation of this magnificent ballet I've ever seen. I initially saw this at a movie theater with about 200+ people; you could have heard a pin drop during many of the pas de deux between Cojocaru and Kobberg, they were that stirring to watch.There was so much to like about this performance...let me elaborate,the Pros:1.)The costumes for the peasants, the Royal hunting party and Wilis were sumptuous; the sets for both acts were nicely conceived to display the rustic theme for the village in Act I and then the marsh scene in Act II.2.)The principal dancers, Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg gave the performance of a lifetime. Cojocaru has such skill and grace...an easy effortlessness that holds her audience spellbound. Kobberg attains such height with his leaps and jumps that it appears as if he can defy gravity.3.) The emotion displayed, through facial expression and body language, by both leads was perfect for the situation; their dancing techniques and skills when together, were simply breath taking. Some of the famous lifts in the Act II were, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen in any performance of Giselle.4.) The conductor, Boris Gruzin, interpretation of Adophe Adam's music was beautifully rendered, complimenting the tone and mood of this ballet that covered both ends of the emotional spectrum.The Cons:About the only concern (albeit minor) for this interpretation of Giselle was with regards to the Corps de ballet. Although the dancing through out the entire ballet was excellent, some of the timing of movement and dance steps was slightly off between some couples, particularly in Act I.Conclusion:Simply the loveliest Giselle I've ever seen; a Giselle that literally moved me to tears. The emotions shown and skills displayed by Cojocaru during this performance were as close to perfection as anyone could ask.5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.Interestingly, the program accompanying the theater performance I saw stated, 'Legend has it that she (Cojocaru) was promoted to principal at the end of the first performance'. You'll understand why when you've seen this DVD.P.P.S.I must admit to a grievous error on my part with my initial review, in which I criticized some of the camera shots and angles. This initial review was based on my viewing of this performance in a movie theater. The home DVD video was much better visually than the performance seen in the movie theater; better because of a much sharper picture as well as less 'close-up' camera shots. I suspect the enlargement that took place to fill an entire movie screen caused some distortion in perception of size and movement, giving the movie house performance a less than perfect visual presentation.My apologies go out to the producers and editors of this fine DVD for my initial review based on my movie theater experience.Ray Nicholson

A fabulous DVD!This disc features Itzhak Perlman* playing two of the worlds most famous violin concertos. ( Beethoven and Brahms). They have been recorded in 1992 at the Schauspielhaus in Berlin with Daniel Barenboim conducting the Berlin Philharmonic.There are so many things to like about this DVD... to mention a few-the audio is simply superb. I'm fortunate enough to have a fairly good sound system and I must say that the audio on this DVD is by far the best I've heard when playing either of these two concertos. The basses are deep and rich and the orchestral passages have a real sense of presence and fullness. Obviously, the acoustics of the theater, along with the sound engineering has resulted in a superior product.-the video was generally well done; the lighting, camera angles and switching were performed, with a couple of minor exceptions, with skillful timing and good effect.-the Beethoven is played with smoothness and grace; the grandeur of the opening bars has always been one of my favorite musical passages. The cadenza is played with skill and technique that Mr. Perlman has become famous for.-the Brahms, to me, is the best I've ever heard and it is different, wonderfully different. The first movement, at times, is played with a sense of primordial passion and well....almost aggression by Mr. Perlman. The notes are seemingly ripped off the instrument with sense of urgency and power. The second movement is the antithesis of the first, played with a quiet sensitivity and beauty that would allow you to hear a pin drop in the audience during one of the brief lulls in the music. The third movement showed unabridged joy and happiness as it pulsed on toward its conclusion.The only niggling feature (from a strictly video point of view) on the entire DVD was perhaps Daniel Barenboim's conducting style; he appeared very stiff on the podium, almost marionette-like at times.All in all, an opportunity to add another masterpiece to one's classical library. Highly recommended!*Mr Perlman plays the Soil Stradivarius (pronounced 'shwah') made in 1714; many consider it to be the finest Strad ever made.

A wonderful story; beautifully presented and well told.I think that this is my favorite Stephen King story (although 'The Dark Tower' series comes close as well). This is a tale of a prison guard (Paul Edgecombe) and convicted child murderer (John Coffey) and the unusual relationship that developes between them on death row in the of fall of 1932.I saw the movie some time ago and it is one of my all time favorites; great acting, well directed and, as with all great movies, has moments that seem to linger with you and are recalled from time to time (and sometimes at the strangest moments).The book and the movie are somewhat different. The story is basically the same of course, but because the book was written in installments, (featuring the main characters serially), I believe it would have been difficult to make a movie of the book that would have made sense. However, what they did with the movie turned out well.The book, not surprisingly has some additional story in it, that is not found in the movie. We are provided with some extra information that deals with Paul's life after he retired from his job on death row and also with a different ending for Mr Jingles then was seen in the movie; both additions alone make reading the book worthwhile (especially the latter).Conclusion;The memorable story of Paul Edgecombe and John Coffey ("like the drink, only not spelled the same way"). An emotional story with some haunting attributes; simply exquisite.5 Stars...more if I couldR. Nicholson

An incredibly beautiful book!This is a story of a young German girl abandoned in the late 1930's and her ordeal of survival over the war years in Nazi Germany.The story is told by the personified spirit of Death; a sympathetic Death who is so worn out and so tired from the countless millenniums of collecting souls. A Death so discouraged by man's inhumanity to man that when is sees something special in our heroine (the book thief) he decides to follow her story over the next few years.Deeply, deeply moving, insightful and, as is often the case in periods of dire circumstance, occasionally humorous. There were moments of profound revelation, moments of quiet discovery that took my breath away; moments when it was difficult not to stop reading and reflect on what one has just read.Reading this book reminded me somewhat of "The Diary of Anne Franck" and although the stories were completely different there was a connection because of the era involved and the wonderful, emotional impact of the written word on the page.All in all, a beautiful, compelling story. Highly recommended! 5 Stars, more if I could.P.S. surprisingly enough this book is found in the young adult section of most book stores; this I feel is a inappropriate classification. This novel really is an adult book and should be placed as such.

An unique love/war story.This is my favorite of the two De Bernieres' novels I own; the other being 'Birds without Wings', which is excellent, but just not my first choice.The novel is set in Greece during the Nazi/Italian occupation during WW II . It's a tale of the hardships during occupation, the Greek resistance and an developing relationship that begins between one of the Italian officers and Greek girl.I simply loved this story. The prose is exquisite; it just makes you want to read on and on. And, despite the fact there was a war going on, there is an atmosphere of high romance and intrigue through out this novel, associated with not only the war, but the developing love story as well.Conclusion:Louis De Bernieres' very best work. Superb, skillful writing that has resulted in a tale well told and beautifully presented.5 Stars, more if I couldR.Nicholson

As my title suggests, a disappointing game!As a sniper in this game, you spent most of your time as an infantry man, trudging the towns, fields, streets etc; but rather than being a true sniper specialist, you play an infantry soldier who just happens to have a sniper rifle.The graphics are fairly good and the FPS perspective is well done, but where this game really falls down is in the gameplay. Let me explain...1.) The play is very linear, you can't stray from the chosen path by more than a yard or two (at which point you'll hit an invisible wall). You have a compass that dictates which way to go next.2.) Your fellow soldiers simply stand around and watch( not all, but a lot of the time), even when they are in the midst of a firefight, (especially when you're in desperate need of assistance)3.) The enemy is repeatedly regenerated from one or two areas and you must kill all of them before you move on to the next encounter. (this became drawn out and tedious after a short while)All in all, a "Call of Duty" wannabe, but poor play makes this effort a game to avoid.

Another great addition to this ongoing trilogy by Jonathon Stroud.Anyone who has enjoyed Book 1 will be very pleased with this latest offering. The story line continues with its fresh, innovative approach with Bartimaeus and Nathaniel getting into all kinds of new intriguing, chilling situations. Stroud's story telling has an addictive quality to it that makes you want to keep on reading; you can absorb several chapters in a sitting without realizing how much time has past.Bartimaeus, the main character, has a wonderfully warped cynical sense of humor along with a generally condescending view of just about everything and everyone; it's his character that makes this series the so compelling.I had one minor complaint about this novel and that revolves around the initial development of Kitty's character (who we met briefly in the first novel). This area of the novel is slow, tedious and predictable and I must admit that I had a hard time getting through this part at first, however once she gets into the story proper she is an interesting and important part of the tale.And finally, a personal subjective opinion; I had expected Nathaniel to mature somewhat as he grew older and had improved his stature within his profession, but instead he has remained a petulant little twerp; however, (and I had to remind myself several times) that this tale is primarily about Bartimaeus, and Nathaniel is more of a secondary, albeit important, character here.All in all, a great addition to this ongoing fantasy. 4 stars.

This game is a 1st person shooter with multiple upgrades to weapons, skills and abilities (reminiscent of 'Deus ex' & 'System Shock').With the right hardware, this is an amazing game; without it, I can imagine the frustration some people are feeling. For me, the game ran without a hitch on 'Vista' with a Dual Core processor, 2 GBs of RAM and a 8800 nVidia video card.There were many positives about the game (and a couple negatives as well)...for instance1.)Wonderful graphics, audio and game play; probably the best I've ever seen. The game is able to take advantage of the new Dx10 (as an option) if you have a system that runs 'Vista'.2.)There is a map; indicating where you are and sometimes showing where your present goal is located.3.)Three levels of difficulty that are changeable at ANYTIME (very useful if your taking a continual beating); The degrees of difficulty could be described as...easy (very much so), medium (a definite challenge) and hard (brutal) It was difficult to stay alive on 'hard'.4.)Movement and firing are handled with the mouse, while weapon/ammo changes are done effectively with the keyboard (this is a useful blend of controls when the action gets hectic).5.)Anytime, anywhere saves and loads with F8 and F9 respectively.6.)A helpful guidance arrow to help you travel at certain times.(travel can be confusing at times) [see Cons: 3.) below]7.)An emotional storyline and plot; the little girls will tug at your heartstrings.8.)Some degree of replayability...you could try a 'different' attitude in your handling of the little girls and also you could focus on different weapons and 'skills'.9.)Non-linear game play; although you have to complete specific goals on each level, you are able to move about unrestricted and explore anywhere.The Cons:1.)The game must be activated via an internet link; I'm not sure if this means you can sell your game or not after your through with it.2.)Very high end hardware is needed to get this game to run smoothly.3.)I found the mapping system a little confusing, at times, e.g. when I changed rooms or went up or down stairs. (really a minor complaint, but you'll understand what I mean once you start playing)Conclusion:This game will (IMO) be very high in the running for single player 'Game of the Year' honors* as it ushers in a new era of improved standards in the field of computer gaming. You will need a powerful system to appreciate this game (and others soon to come) in the way the developers had intended. Simply a joy to play. 5 Stars.* other nominees of single player 'Game of the Year' might be 'Call of Duty 4' and Half Life 2 episode 2, with 'Timeshift' and 'STALKER-Chernobyl' close behind. Crysis would be a more distant runner up.

Another fabulous musical event by Andre, his singers and orchestra. This concert was performed before a live audience in Dublin in (I believe) 2003. Some of the music has a definite "Irish" flavor to it, as one would expect from its locale.There were many highlights to this DVD but my favorites would have to be Carmen Monarcha's exquisitely sung "O mio babbino caro" from Puccini's 'Gianni Schichhi' and also Carla Maffioletti's puppetesque performance of J. Offenbach's "Song of Olympia". Some other lilting Irish melodies were beautifully done and these were really appreciated and enjoyed by the audience.And now a personal, subjective choice. If I had to buy one, and only one, Andre Rieu DVD I would have to give my unequivocal vote for the "Tuscany" DVD. Why? you ask; let me explain...The music is of the same high quality but the intangible difference between the two discs is in the relaxed mood, spontaneous joy and atmosphere that seem to permeate the Tuscany audience. Don't get me wrong, the people in Dublin had a great time. It's just that, to me, the same degree of 'exhilaration' did not seem to occur within the Dublin concert. I got the feeling that while Andre and the orchestra seemed enjoy themselves in Dublin, they seemed to be having a awesome time during the Tuscany performance and this seemed to shine through on the Tuscany recording. I must tell you I've watched the Tuscany DVD so many times that I almost feel like I know the people in the front two rows on a first name basis.All in all, both DVD's are great; take your choice (or even better, get both)

A wonderful read (even with the translation)!Flaubert has written an engaging tale (set in 19th century rural France) that is beautifully written (or a least translated). The quality of the prose of descriptions of persons, places and things is of the highest quality; however, some of the conversations between characters, may have lost a little something in the translation. Nonetheless, this book had no trouble keeping my interest and provided me with a dramatic tragedy that was, to say the least, memorable.This book must have caused quite a stir in its day, due to what would have been considered a scandalous topic at the time of its original publication. (SPOILER) It is the story of a beautiful, but bored and unsatisfied housewife, paired with a naive, cuckold husband; both of whom unwittingly conspire (her actively, him passively) to lead their marriage on an ever downward spiraling path to ruin.Simply a superbly told tale! 5 Stars.

This is a top notch fantasy/adventure.I must admit the beginning was a little slow to get going, but once into this novel, I found it hard to put down. Some of the reviews on the covers described it as a real pager turner and I'd have to agree. It was one of those books that I really looked forward to getting a few minutes to read a few more pages.The novel has all the ingredients for an intriguing fantasy story; there is magic, betrayal, love, unspeakable cruelty, true kindness and friendship and some unexpected sudden changes in circumstance; . (in some ways reminded me of George Martin's "Fire and Ice" series). You will find that Myrren's "gift" adds a definite twist in the genre of average fantasy tales.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the writing quality was not great, and, to a certain degree, this may be true, but the story itself is so interesting, you become deeply immersed in it before you realize what's happening. I felt the quality of the book and story telling improved as the novel progressed and at the end I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I neared the riveting conclusion of this book.All in all, good fantasy reading; I'm looking forward to Book II

This is a fabulous continuation to Book One, "Myrren's Gift".In my opinion, Fiona McIntosh is quickly becoming one of the best fantasy writers out there; this work ranks up there with the heavy weight authors of the genre such as George Martin ( Fire and Ice), Scott Bakker ( The Prince of Nothing), and Stephen Erikson (The Malazan Book of the Fallen)This original storyline keeps you turning the pages with its fast pace and unexpected developments. Just when you thinks things are finally settling down...well, another surprise is just around the corner. As with the first book, magic, deceit, love, cruelty and betrayal play a part in telling of this magnificent tale.All in all, simply great fantasy writing! The final book in this trilogy is due out early next year and I can hardly wait. If you enjoy the fantasy/adventure genre then read "Blood and Memory", you will not be disappointed.

An enthusiastic 2 thumbs up for this unit!I've had the Sportster for about a month now and I couldn't be happier. Let me elaborate...1.)This unit has the advantage of 30 slots of memory for 30 different radio stations. All available at the click of a button on the unit or the remote.2.)Pause/Rewind. You can pause any broadcast and then get up to 44 minutes playback. If you used the save feature you can also fast-forward to skip items your not interested in.3.)You can save up to 20 song titles to memory. Anytime one of these songs in played anywhere on Sirius Radio you will be notified so you can listen if you want to.4.)Good quality stereo FM sound that is uninterrupted unless you go through tunnels or behind buildings.5.)All the NFL, NBA, NHL etc. All live and you can set up this unit to notify you when your team/broadcast begins. (And with the save feature you can listen to your team score that touchdown again and again.)6.)Fully functioning remote. Actually this is the best way to change channels while in your car (the buttons on the unit are small and may be difficult to use safely while driving if the Sportster is on the car dash).7.)Easy setup of antenna and suctioned holder (removable) for in car use. (Suction works great if moisten before applying.)8.)There is a kit available to use the unit in your house.* One important negative;The magnetic antenna that attaches to your car hood or roof will scratch the paint IF you repeatedly remove it (for instance, to prevent theft while going into a store). I had to cover the bottom of the antenna with a sticky-back cloth tape to prevent direct contact with the paint of my car. (this did not cause problems with the antenna's magnetic function as the magnet is so strong it still stuck to the metallic surface with no difficulty)All in all a satellite radio that I've enjoyed much more than I anticipated. For the extra bucks you get a lot of extra features, which, if you listen to a lot of radio, is a good value. Recommended!

Despite some problems, the game itself is really fun to play!The Pros:Dark Messiah Might and Magic is the type of computer game I really enjoy, that being primarily a FPS combined with touch of RPG; if you like System Shock or Deus Ex then I'm sure this game will be of interest to you. This game (when it works properly [more below]) has it all; some interesting quests, first person combat with traditional weapons or magic against various groups of enemies. There were even a few individual bosses to defeat along the way.One of the nicest things about this game is its replayability; you could, for instance, play the game as a warrior/fighter and then try the game again using the skill points you've earned to develop a top flight assassin or mage. Lots of variety, lots of choices, IF, you can get the game to run properly.The Cons: (from most important to minor)1.)Crashes, but less with the latest patch. I eventually put the game settings on low (especially the video [and without any real reduction in game play enjoyment]); I found this reduced most (but not all) of the crashes that usually occurred when I tried to reload after dying or loading a new scene.2.)The audio and video were often out of sync, for both talking scenes and battle sounds.3.)Only a small number of recent saves (maybe 3 or 4 ) which sometimes made it difficult to use your hard earned skill points wisely for upgrades. (some skills were very useful [depending on your character], others less so).4.) Really annoying, grating voice acting for Leanne and Phenrig.All in all, a great game; they should have waited a little longer to fix the bugs before releasing it.

I bought this CD today, listened to it twice and probably never will again.My concerns?...let me explain1.) Can these guys sing?...well, maybe they can (but you'd never know it from this CD). I've heard them a few times before; but on this disc, while they seemed to sing well individually, their voices did not "blend" well when they tried to sing together. I'm not sure what the problem was with this performance because their other recordings are much better.2.) The music...maybe it was the arrangement (the way the music was scored) that seemed to put the musical quality on this recording off; the orchestral music being played for the songs on this CD just didn't seem to compliment the voice of the singers.All in all, a seasonal CD (one wonders if it was rushed to get it out for Xmas) that should have be wonderful to listen to, but just wasn't. 1 1/2 Stars, grudgingly rounded up to 2 Stars.P.S. I wonder how many people think this a great album just because the guys are very good looking? Can the eye really sway the ear that much...apparently it can.

I must admit to some disappointment in this DVD; not because of the quality of the content but rather the content itself. Also, this disc is short, very short...only 54 minutes in factThis DVD features four of the male stars of todays American Ballet Theatre: That being, Jose Manuel Carreno (Cuba), Angel Corella (Spain), Vladimir Malakhov (Russia) and Ethan Stiefel (USA).I'd expected some extended video of each of the dancers actually dancing, but instead the bulk of the video is more of less a mini biography of each of the dancers with brief snippets of each of them from previous shows they were in.There is also an extended section showing them rehearsing a dance, a pas de quatre, danced to Scubert's piano quintet; the finished work is about 7 minutes long and shown at the very end of the disc. This was well done and performed before a live audience.I think the highlight of this disc, to me, was a short segment of each of them on a trampoline, with a single photograph frame capturing some spectacular aerial pose at the apex of their leaps. Unbelievable height and agility.All in all, not quite what I expected when I purchased this DVD. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy it, I did, (getting some insight on the lives of these fabulously talented individual was very interesting, but it's just not something that I'd probably watch more than once. And watching some of my favorite choreographed dances is something that I do watch on a regular and repeated basis.

I was somewhat disappointed in the DVDThis is a 1984 recording on the Sony label by H. Von Karajan and Anne-Sophie Mutter: It is part of Karajan`s Legacy recordings.I've always considered Beethoven's Concerto in D major for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 61, one of the greatest pieces of music of all time. The opening orchestral bars have a grandeur to them that is emotionally stirring and uplifting, and the solo violin builds on this theme throughout the first movement. The second movement is slow and deliberate and continues non-stop into the rondo finale, which is simply breathtaking.I had previously purchased the CD version (recorded in 1980) of this recording and was struck with the beauty of the playing. I thought that the DVD version would give a visual enhancement to the superb audio that I had come to know and enjoy. Sadly, such is not the case. While the music remains spectacular and there is nothing technically wrong with the video, I have several concerns: for instance, I found that camera placements and film editing were less that ideal. Most shots of Anne-Sophie Mutter (at least in the first movement) were from her left side with Von Karajan to her immediate front: this one view became rather monotonous after a while and it was hard to see her finger work from this position. Also, the camera work on the orchestra tended to be tight close-ups of several sets of violins, cellos, clarinets etc.: there where virtually no panoramic views of the orchestra, which I feel, would have been preferred for some of the magnificent orchestral passages: which instead featured mostly Von Karajan.But, I think my biggest disappointment was the stage presence of Anne-Sophie Mutter, or lack thereof. She appeared to be tense (I suppose who could blame her, given the circumstances): eyes almost never looked up from her instrument. Little or no personality shone through during this performance to go along with the extraordinary music that was coming from her instrument. [In comparison, try to see Gil Shahan's performance of Pablo De Sarasate's Carmen Fantasy, opus 25 on the New Year's Gala 97 (ARTHAUS label) and you'll see what I mean about playing with emotion and what an effect it has on the overall presentation.]All in all, not what I had expected or had hoped for when I purchase this DVD. A 5 star audio recording but the video portion does not do justice to the beauty and grace of Beethoven's Violin Concerto.

This is a wonderful book by Sam R Watkins: a confederate soldier that survived the entire American Civil War (1861-1865). Watkins was a private who joined the Tennessee Army and with whom he participated in every battle and skirmish that the regiment was involved. He received several wounds but never any serious enough to keep him out of action for very long.These memoirs where written about 20 years (circa 1882) after the last shot was fired and so there are some minor errors in the facts regarding some of the events described. The descriptions are short individual vignettes of battles, marches and daily life associated with the Confederate Army.What makes this account of the civil war special is the quality of the story telling. The language has a sensitivity to it that seems to capture your imagination and emotions. It is, of course, at times explicitly descriptive, regarding some of the battles and their aftermath, but there are passages that are movingly sad and others that are quite humorous: tales of how thousands of men have to learn to live together and adapt to survive prolonged stressful conditions. The narrative description of the deprivation and dilapidation of the Confederate Army at wars end is heart rendering; men in filthy, tattered clothes, many barefoot and starving.I learned several things from this work; for instance, I was unaware of the numerous small battles that never claimed the infamy of Gettysburg, Antietam, Manassas etc. but were none the less just as vicious as their larger counterparts. Daily skirmishes were not an infrequent occurrence. I was unaware previously of the frequent court-martials and firing squads used to deal with the relatively large number of deserters from the Southern Army. Also interesting was the acute awareness and acumen of the lowly private soldiers regarding the circumstances surrounding some events that were looming in their immediate future; i.e. battle formations, forced marches, incompetent leaders etc. If the generals had the instincts that some of the "regulars" did, a lot of the carnage may have been substantially reduced or avoided.The only negatives are (thus the loss of one star)1.) there are very few dates given(you assume the book runs chronologically)2.) a map would have made it so much easier to follow the marches and battles locationsAll in all a compelling work: personal insights that you just don't find in larger accounts of this period.Highly recommended if you have any interest in the Civil War era.

This product contains three replacement heads for the Norelco 9160XL electric razor. After 1 1/2 years of continuous daily usage the original cutting heads were no longer giving a good shave. I decided to replace the original blades with this set.The good:1.)Easy to following instruction for replacement on the package, and the actual replacement process was incredibly simple and easy to do.2.)The new blades functioned perfectly; because the decline in performance of the original blades was so gradual, it was difficult to believe how much of an improvement these replacement blades provided.The not so good:Only one complaint; the packaging. The replacement blade were embodied in a package that made it extremely difficult to actually get at the blades. There were a series of 6 grommet eyelets surrounding the entire package making it very secure. I literally had to force scissors between the layers of cardboard to get around the grommets to eventually get to the blades inside. In a word...frustrating. Plus, a slight slip and a bad cut may have occurred (I think everyone has experienced trying to open one of these newer hard-plastic wrapped items and knows just how difficult it can really be to get at the product inside).Conclusion:An excellent set of replacement blades. (I just hope they'll last longer than the 3 months it took for the original blades to start to lose their sharpness). Time will tell; but up to now, so far so good.However, getting the blades out of this package could be considered a potential hazard.5 Stars for the product itself, with 1 or 2 Stars off for the needless obstructive packaging.Addendum Feb 24/08:Interesting to note that they've changed the packaging on this product (since my original review) making it appear that it's less hazardous to access. However, as I haven't purchase this specific product package, I can't comment on the ease of access (or safety) of the new packaging.R.Nicholson

An entertaining, short fantasy read (the book is only 322 pages long).I stumbled upon this author (Jim Butcher) while reading someones' review; I've always enjoyed fantasy so I decided to give it a try.'Storm Front' is the first of a series of books (now 10 or so books) starring Butcher's hero, Harry Dresden. Dresden is a wizard/part-time private investigator who often gets involved, with or without the police, in investigating paranormal occurrences.The writing quality is reminiscent of your typical detective/sleuth novel...only better. What I really liked was the way the story really hooked you into reading on and on; there was always something happening, or about to happen, to keep your interest at a high level.Also, it was not hard to identify and like Harry with his self-depreciating and cynical humor. Other characters, although not greatly developed, are intriguing and easily fit into the frame work of this story. And as you might suspect, there were some interesting confrontations involving humans as well as your evil fantasy types.Conclusion:A short fantasy read that is well presented and fast paced. It has an interesting hero and the storyline that will tweak your curiosity to the very end. 4 1/2 to 5 Stars.R.Nicholson

A great fantasy read.Anyone who has read and enjoyed J. K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series will be pleased with this offering by Jonathon Stroud. The setting is in modern day London and features two initially antagonistic heroes; that being Bartimeaus, (a demon) and Nathaniel (a young apprentice magician)What makes this novel so "special" is its extremely addictive and fresh story line coupled with an easy to read writing style. It's a "I just have to read one more paragraph, one more chapter" type of book.The main characters are intriguing; especially Bartimaeus, who has been reluctantly summoned by the novice magician. As you get into this novel he shows his true nature, a cynical sense of humor and condescending attitude to all things (both human and fellow demons alike). His mind is usually preoccupied by one of two thoughts; that being, some sort of revenge towards someone or, more importantly, self preservation (and not necessarily in that order). It's impossible not to like this cunning creature, even with all his sense of righteous indignation.Nathaniel's character, who we initially meet as a young child, develops into an interesting adolescence; replete with all the difficulties and awkwardness of going through this age group. As his relationship develops with Bartimaeus, his magic abilities grow but he still struggles with some youthful immaturity.All in all a superb opening for this trilogy: I loved this book; could hardly wait to find time to get back to it and I'm looking forward to Book II.

A very good DVDI'd been looking for a DVD of Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto when I came across this disc that featured two independent recordings; Beethoven's Emperor Concerto in 1989 with the Munich Philharmonic, and then 3 Mozart piano sonatas in 1995.(also recorded in Munich).I must admit I was unfamiliar with the name Friedrich Gulda (1930-2000) until this time. Initially, I was somewhat surprised by his causal attire when he arrived on stage; the concert appeared to have very laid-back atmosphere. However, Mr. Gulda proved to be a pianist extraordinaire, as was evident by his interpretation and skill with both the Beethoven and the Mozart. The playing is enthusiastic and passionate throughout, and despite looking decidedly older and more frail in the 1995 recordings, I liked the Mozart sonata in D major K 576 best of all the works on this disc.The only negative is that the recording has picked up some of Mr. Gulda's humming and mutterings that occurred while he was playing. This was not particularly distracting to me but I mention it for the sake of completeness.There is only scant information on the disc case and there is no booklet with this DVD but the disc has extra material on it giving some biography info on Mr. Gulda and a brief history of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. There is also an option to have some on screen musical analysis done while you're watching this recording.All in all, a fine DVD to add to one's library of classical music.

Listening to classical radio has once more paid unexpected dividends; yet again I discover a treasure that would have escaped my notice and I would never have otherwise heard.This disc is a collection of Easter music performed by the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir under the direction of Nikolai Korniev. It is beautifully recorded in the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in St. Petersburg, Russia; the wonderful acoustics of this magnificent structure adds to the spiritual effect that this music requires.The entire CD is beautiful, but it is the very first piece on the disc (the one that I heard on radio) that caught my undivided attention, that being, " Alleluia, Behold the Bridegroom". This haunting melody played as quiet chant, repeated over and over, rises to a soft crescendo before it reaches its conclusion. It is hard to believe that this piece has gone virtually unnoticed; that it has not become a staple of sacred music through out the Christian world at Easter time. Even more astonishing is that the author of this incredible work has become lost with time; the creator, who in this case has flirted with a small measure of immortality, is simply recognized as "anonymous".All in all, a CD that any lover of choral music (sacred or otherwise) would absolutely cherish and desire for their collection; but it is " Alleluia, Behold the Bridegroom" that will move your soul.Highly recommended.

This CD by Deutsche Grammophon presents Beethoven's 5th and 7th Symphonies, conducted by Christian Thielemann. When I initially heard this recording it struck me as an excellent recording of both works, but particularly the 5th.What I really liked about this recording was Thielemann's interpretation of the first movement of the Fifth. Most conductors seem (IMO) to rush through the da, da, da, da's, which encompass the theme of arguably the worlds most recognized symphony. Thielemann's approach to that same 4 note sequence is play them a little slower and a little more drawn-out, resulting in a more intense and powerful interpretation. On paper his notes might be described as daaa...daaa...daaa...daaaaaa. I realize it may be difficult to comprehend what I'm trying to describe, but for me at least, he has captured the essence of Beethoven's creation in its most powerful interpretation. I've never grown tired of hearing this piece.The 7th symphony is equally well done; again, a somewhat slower version giving a more 'thoughtful' presentation. I especially love those triumphant horns at the end of the first movement, overcoming all the doubts and insecurities that have been presented for several bars prior to the ending; stirring!Conclusion:Two superb performances on one CD.The recording of the 5th is my all time favorite; no other conductor has interpreted the first movement of the fifth with such intensity and force.5 Stars. Highly recommended.R.NicholsonP.S. Interestingly enough some of the other reviewers here, dislike Thielemann's treatment of the 5th for the very reason I loved it. A case of one man's treasure...I guess.

A wonderful novel!This is a war time story by Irene Nemirovsky; Irene Nemirovsky, a Jew, died in a concentration camp in Auschwitz on Aug 17, 1942. This magnificent manuscript remained virtually forgotten for more than 60 years after the authors death. It tells of the early war years (1940-1941) with the Germans having just defeated the French army and occupying northern France.The novel is broken into 2 sections. The first section, "Storm in June", deals with the story of about half a dozen persons and their immediate family or associates. Initially, it's an account of these soon-to-be refugees trying to endure the collective humiliation of a nation devastated by their recent defeat in the war; but it is more than this, it is really about the individual changes and personal hardships that are thrust upon hordes of unprepared poor, middle and upper middle class people. Charity, compassion and fair play are thrown out the window and replaced with greed, hoarding and personal survival (at any cost). A striking change in life's values when " the chips are down".The second part of the novel, "Dolce", was my favorite and I felt, the most beautiful part. It is, in essence, two different love stories. One between a German officer, billeted in a small French home, and a middle class French women and the other, a more generalized affair between the occupiers and the conquered. Over the course of their 3 month occupation the Germans soldiers, despite their attempts to act civilly and integrate with the villagers, have difficulty understanding why the people of the village don't accept them, and in turn, the villagers, who initially will have nothing to do with the invaders, begin to actually like and even admire some of these "foreigners" by the time they depart to the new Russian front. This second section was well written and beautifully told; something to be appreciated and savored, like good wine.Two appendices contain some hand written notes by the author made while conceiving this novel and also some correspondence between the author and associates dated in 1942. Another section at the back of this book gives a brief resume of the authors life.All in all a magnificent novel. Highly recommended! 5 stars.P.S. If you enjoyed this book as much as I did then I'd humbly suggest reading "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak. Another novel of the same time era; beautifully written, movingly sad, but yet a pleasure to read. R.A.N.

An enjoyable CD.This disc features Claudio Arrau, playing Chopin's entire set of Nocturnes and Impromptus. The playing is soft and performed with feeling; it's easy to listen to either straight up on a good home theatre system or as background music appropriate for a small dinner party.All in all Chopin played with a quiet, thoughtful passion. Recommended.

I must admit that I was disappointed with this DVD.I purchased this DVD based on some familiarity with Joan Sutherland's voice and the distinctly positive input from the reviewers of this disc.Joan Sutherland was in her vocal prime prior to the advances of today's recording technology and this fact has resulted in a recording that is less than perfect. (Certainly not her fault) Some of the audio performances are scratchy and the videos in some are slightly flawed. The settings look typical of the late50-early 60's TV production and by today's standard, I suppose, are outdated.If you may have seen these performances live or been familiar with J. Sutherlands' talents when she was at her best, you might really enjoy this disc.To me the DVD was expensive and the above mentioned technical flaws did not allow me to appreciate this work as I had expected. I suppose I should be grateful that these recordings are available at all, and I am, but.....Technically, at best, a work for the archives: useful for a look in the past at this great singer and her God given talent.

I'd eagerly awaited this final book in the "Quickening" trilogy; I was not disappointed. As my title suggests, I really enjoyed this book with one minor reservation...let me explain.The pros:The book is easy to read and intriguing from the opening chapter. It has, as with most great fantasy stories, a plot filled with love, betrayal, friendship, unexpected twists and turns and a liberal dose of magic. I found myself reading late into the night to satisfy my need to find out what happens next... just one more chapter!The book has several different storylines, told alternately, that revolve around the main characters of the first two novels, that being Wyl, Valentyna, Fynch, Aremys, Cailech and of course the main villain of the tale, Celimus. The individual tales come together at the end to make for satisfactory conclusion.(To those of us who thought we'd figured out the ending for this trilogy at the end of book two... well think again.)There is also good character development of the people in this book making them more real to the readers. Characters you love to love or love to hate as the circumstances dictate.The cons: (small spoiler)Despite my enthusiasm for this novel I have one complaint, and it has a tone of disappointment associated with it; that being the overuse of magical devices/occurrences to tie up some of the potential loose ends at the conclusion of the book. After an entire book of brilliant buildups involving untold hardships, cruelty and suffering, (and some good things as well) we have a fairy tale ending...an "everyone lives happily ever after" conclusion that just doesn't fit the mood or style of the rest of this magnificent tale.All in all a great ending to this trilogy (even with the minor concern I mentioned in the above paragraph); a testament to Fiona McIntosh's developing skills as a writer in this genre. This to me, fits right up there with R.R. Martin's "Ice and Fire" series as well as Steven Erikson's "Malazan Book of the Fallen" novels. Well done!!! 4 1/2 stars.

An interesting read.This book is a collection of ten short stories by George Martin that were written in the late 60's and early 70's. The writing is not quite up to the quality of the "Ice and Fire" series, however if you look beneath the surface you can see the beginnings of the style that has made the aforementioned series a resounding success.The stories are all off world adventures including the Hugo Award winning "A Song for Lya", however it is the story "Override" that is my favorite in this group of ten. This tale has a gut wrenching, visceral component to it that we fantasy fans have grown to love in Mr. Martins' latest offerings. In fact, I'd recommend buying this book for this story alone, it's that good.All in all, early G.R.R. Martin, and definitely worth reading.

A small gem!Every once in a while a book comes along that really moves me with its quiet beauty; "A Thousand Days in Tuscany" fits easily into this category.Wonderfully written and easy to read with its soft descriptive prose; the words transport you from your comfortable sofa to a magnificent area of Italy that is renowned for its people and its unique landscape.The book follows two new arrivals to the Tuscan region of Italy and tells of their interactions with the local residents; people who soon become part of their daily routine. Each chapter is a small vignette describing a situation (usually with a local personage), a trip and, above all, food; in fact all chapters get around to the discussion of, or preparation of food. Most chapters end with a recipe for the main dish that was describe in the chapter involved.All in all, a warm, quiet and beautifully descriptive short book about an area of the world that all of us would probably love to visit at least once in our lifetime. Highly recommended.

Another very good fantasy read from Mitchell Graham.This book is the second in a continuation of the "The Fifth Ring" series. I actually enjoyed this book more than the first; the pace was better (there was a slow, drawn out section in the middle of the first book that I found tedious to get through). As with most good fantasy there was magic, battles, friendship and betrayals; all of which made for page turning interest. While the first book was good, this one was even harder to put down.The only negative, as with the first book, was the map; (and although I'm grateful for a map) it is poorly drawn and of limited use (a little more detail would have helped immensely).A good story, well told; I look forward to book 3. 5 Stars.

While there were some very good tense encounters in this book, I felt that overall, this was the weakest of the three novels in the series. To me, there seemed to be some credibility gaps in not only some of the events, but also in some of the attitudes and conversions between several of the characters throughout various areas of this novel.To mention a few (but not all) concerns...(potential spoilers to follow)When Matthew and Father Thomas finally get back together after 4 years apart, it takes about 2 weeks to pass by before Matthew finally asks Father Thomas about his girlfriend/lover, Lara. Imagine...2 WEEKS go by before you inquire about the love of your life...is she still alive?...does she still love me?...is there someone else? I mean, get real.Several conversations between Mat and Teanne, Gawl (with others) and Teanne continually get into an unending loop of "why should we trust you after what you did before", over and over again, page after page etc. And in addition, there are other "conversations" that seem to have a repetitive tone to them, giving the dialogues an almost immature, adolescent quality.Gawl (a huge, kindly hulk of a man, who just happens to be king) has taken on Hagrid (of Harry Potter fame) like persona. Once I made a link between these two characters, I couldn't shake the connection, thus taking away for me some of Gawl's personality and uniqueness.There were some areas in the book that were somewhat slow and tedious, while some important events, although in sequence, seemed forced; a little rushed. I some ways, I had the feeling that the author was getting tired and just wanted to be finished with this work.While the trilogy as a whole was well done, this was a somewhat disappointing finale (after the 1st two books, I was eager to get into this concluding installment). This book seemed to lose some of the "magic" (no pun intended) the previous books had. 3- 3 1/2 Stars.

An enticing fantasy/adventure by Paul Kearney.When I started to read this book I had some initial concerns that it may have been meant for an adolescent audience; such is not the case. Although the story seems to begin rather tamely, the main character (Rol) quickly becomes engrossed in a story of travel, intrigue and combat; then add to this some sexual innuendos, betrayals and a liberal dose of magic, and you have just about everything anyone could want in a good adult fantasy novel.The quality of writing is good, however it is the story line, with its many twists and surprises, that really make this book hard to put down.All in all, a excellent start to (hopefully) a ongoing series of entertaining novels. The second book is coming out soon and I'm looking forward to being able to continue to follow the story of Rol. 5 Stars.

A disappointing book!Like several other reviewers, I too, was intrigued by the nifty cover and the glowing reports from some well respected fantasy authors. Now, I find I've less respect some of these authors than I did before, and I've become determined not to be influenced again, when buying a book, by another "pretty face".The story initially seemed to have such great prospects; revolving around two central figures who, while simultaneously on the same side, are constantly suspicious of each others intentions. Unfortunately, this theme became tiresome when it began reappearing in chapter after chapter, with nothing ever changing and with nothing ever resolved.There were times when I thought the story was finally gelling into something substantial, only to find it falling flat... again.Another concern was the writing of the battle scenes; the good guys always seemed at an initial disadvantage, but were repeatably able to win with surprising ease and lack of substantial casualties.This book, at times (albeit rarely), showed promise but the difference between promising and producing has resulted in a novel that is lacking in overall quality. 1 1/2 stars (grudgingly rounded up to 2).

"Novice to Master; An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity", is an autobiography of the life of Buddha Master, Soko Morinaga. It was translated to English by Belenda Attaway Yamakawa. This small book is 153 pages in length.This book uses a series of short anecdotal tales to reveal some of the trials, tribulations and dedicated perseverance required to train to be a disciple and eventually a Buddhist monk.I guess as an outsider, both to the Buddha mantra and also, in general, the far-eastern, oriental life style, I had difficultly understanding why anyone would put themselves through this prolonged, regimented and extremely Spartan existence...all done of their own accord.And yet, if your a non-believer (religious) but still believe in a basic 'spiritual' goodness that lies deep (often hidden) within the entity of what we wishfully call the human spirit or soul, then the Buddhist philosophy does make some degree of sense.During the course of this work, we witness brief glimpses into some of the perspectives of thinking that has taken Soko Roshi (Roshi, being the honorific used to refer to a venerated master) years of training to achieve...and from these brief examples I can, towards the end of this book, begin to appreciate that a lifetime of self-denial and deprivation might be the only way to a formulate some of these ideas and impressions.However, it just left me wondering if there might not be a somewhat less austere way accomplishing this objective. Certainly the minds of young acolytes... many filled with the want of a better life style, more money, better clothes etc. would have to undergo an abrupt 180 degree reversal of thinking, requiring years, if ever, to accomplish. It's not easy to attain and live a life of 'enlightenment'.Conclusion:An interesting book; not always easy to comprehend...especially the philosophical musings. In addition, it gives some details into the harsh training and will power needed to become a Buddhist monk. I think any attempt to explain the ideology in greater depth, may have made many 'unenlightened' readers, such as myself, totally lost. I did however, come away with a feeling of a little better knowledge of Buddhism and it's ideals. 3 1/2 to 4 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.Thanks to amazon friend, 'Miz Ellen' for suggesting this book

This is the first of the Steven Erikson's "Malazan Book of the Fallen" series that I did not enjoy as much as the preceding ones... let me explain.Unlike previous books in this series, (where there many short chapters introducing many different characters and multiple story lines), the "House of Chains" begins with a long section (263 pages) envolving one person and one theme. This particular character I did not really "bond" with; thus this first part of this book I found somewhat tedious and took me a long time to get through. After this initial slow beginning the author then reverted to his normal style of story telling and I found this much more interesting and I had that urge to get back to this book and read whenever I could.The other area of concern (at least to me) was the ending; with so many characters in so many different places that I found it difficult to tell just what was going on, to whom and where events were happening.All in all a good book 4, in this otherwise magnificent series; just not quite up quality of the previous three.

A fabulous DVD!This disc was recorded in 1995 and features Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Daniel Barenboim (on piano and orchestra conductor) with the Berlin Philharmonic.I became interested in this music because I'd heard the Choral Fantasy while listening to CBC radio 2 (Canada). When I looked up the Choral Fantasy on Amazon.com I found that it was available on DVD and it also contained Beethoven's Triple Concerto. It was a pleasant surprise to find both these magnificent works on one disc.There were many things I liked about this disc...to mention a few.-while the Choral Fantasy is awesome on its own (with Daniel Barenboim giving a virtuoso performance), it is the Triple Concerto that is the spectacular focal point on this disc. Its infectious melody is performed with such pace and intensity that I sensed that all participants were totally absorbed in giving what could only be described, at least to me, as a performance of a lifetime.-this disc is the perfect example of why classical music such as this should be on DVD as well as CD. The video of this performance does so much to enhance the enjoyment of the music; the camera work and film editing for the entire disc make this DVD a superior product. There were close ups of fingers and instruments, as well as shots of individuals and some panoramic views of the orchestra. The camera switching was done with impeccable timing and with great effect; for instance, there is one point in the 3rd movement of the Triple Concerto that you could see the perspiration glistening on Yo-Yo Ma's brow as rivulets of sweat ran down his cheek. Just great camera work!-the emotional impact of the music on Ma , Perlman and Barenboim during this performance cannot be overstated; the intensity and concentration on the faces, as well as the animated body language of the principals could be clearly seen and appreciated.-and finally, it appeared that all three featured performers, as well as the orchestra and chorus were elated with the way this performance continued to progress during the evening; a sense of joyous accomplishment seemed to permeate the orchestral stage... What a thrill it must have been to have witnessed live.Highlight of the disc:So many to consider, but I think my favorite part of this entire disc is Yo-Yo Ma's beginning of the beautiful Largo (2nd movement); He is totally absorbed in his work, every note played with the utmost tenderness and feeling. Stirring to watch.All in all, a 5 star performance in audio, video and most importantly emotional content. It's just hard to imagine finding a better Triple Concerto or Choral Fantasy anywhere.P.S. The only thing I found odd about this performance was the delayed audience response at the end of the Triple Concerto. (one of the other reviewers mentioned this as well) I got the feeling from the way the audience finally responded, that they weren't quite sure it was over (that no one wanted to be the first to clap or cheer); the only other explanations would be that they didn't like it (unlikely) or were so enraptured with the music they simply forget when it was finished.

A fantasy/adventure of the highest order!This is the first in the 'Sword of Shadows' series by J.V.Jones. I'd seen other comments on this trilogy by other reviewers and decided to give this author a try...with very favorable results.Without giving any of the story away, this book's main focus is on 3 characters, Raif, a clansman; Ash, an orphan savant of great (but unbeknown to her) magical powers; and Effie, a small girl of the same clan as Raif. The entire story takes place in a near frozen tundra-like landscape.As with most fantasy tales this is an adventure that involves people or creatures with magical abilities. However what separates this book from so many of the other offerings in this genre is the quality of the writing; in short, that elusive skill of great story telling. This tale does have some battles etc., but its strength comes from the development of a host of well developed characters (not only those mentioned above, but several other side-players as well).I find it interesting how quickly a reader (me, in this case) can determine when they've found a 'gem' in what they are reading; such is the case with this book (and I hope series). Within the space of several pages of the opening chapter, I found there was a definitive feeling of tension and intrigue that made me aware that I was reading something special. And, more importantly, these traits continued throughout the entire book. This WAS a book that was hard to put down.Also interesting to note, is that some of the other reviewers complained of the book being 'slow' and in truth I can appreciate where this attitude is coming from. However, the strength of story (and its telling) was strong enough, that this concern was not a problem for me. In fact, the 'slowness' allowed the story to develop at a more natural pace and overall, really improved the telling of the tale...I guess you might compare it to savouring a glass of fine wine.Conclusion:J.V.Jones has written a superb fantasy/adventure. And despite the persistent bleakness of the geographic locale, the story grabs you and just doesn't let go...and who could ask for anything more than this. Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War" was written by Max Brooks. The Kindle edition is 352 pages in length.SYNOPSIS...NO SPOILERSThe entire book is a series of interviews conducted AFTER the end of the Zombie wars. The interviews are taken in a general chronological order...that is, from the very beginning of the outbreak, where no one was really sure of what was going on, to the end where the 'infestation' has been globally defeated (at least they hope so).The book encompassed individual tales from survivors from around the world...from the arctic to antarctic, all world land masses, oceans and islands...no area was immune as the Earth was literally overrun with undead. All interviewees had some part to play in the wars...some a minor bit involved in some local, isolated 'event', others a major role to play in a more national or global strategy.What impressed me most about the different accounts was this; although each one was a short personal excerpt, they all fitted together perfectly in the telling overall history of the Zombie wars. All stories were varied, unique and interesting; tales of battles in mountains passes, on the plains, on shorelines, on oceans...stories of bravery, isolation and darkness, fear, the humiliation and guilt of leaving others behind while while some fled for their lives. All the tales had a real touch of humanity about them because they not only recounted the actual events of the day, but also took into account how the passage of time could change one's perspective of those horrendous days. And some of these 'insights' were often both very revealing and heart rendering.Concerns:...only one...(the believability factor rears its ugly head once again for me)(SPOILER) The tale of Sensei Tomonaga Ijira...a BLIND Japanese martial arts master who, despite his handicap and being alone, recalls one battle where "I dispatched forty-one in as many minutes", and then he proceeded to bury them all! This one story, among all these other fabulous and haunting tales was really the only 'weak' spot in the entire book.Conclusion:A fabulous book; well written as a series of small vignettes that are filled with the emotional strengths and frailties of human existence when placed under extreme stress. 4 3/4 Stars (1/4 Star off for Ijira's story)Ray Nicholson

After reviewing the reports of other reviewer I decided to purchase (with some trepidation) these headphones from Bose.My short experience with this set has resulted in several positive viewpoints...to mention a few1.) Great sound (as you would expect from Bose) especially the base; deep and rich with a full presence to it. ( without drowning out the rest of the frequencies)2.) Extremely light weight (a total of 5 oz.!); a pleasure to wear3.) Comfortable circumaural fit; the cushions sit on your head, not on the earlobes, making them wearable for an extended period of time before your ears start to become tired.4.) Even comfortable lying down on a sofa; I've tried other headphones that, when you try to wear them while reclining, are pushed off your ears by the pillows or cushions. Not so with this set; they are small enough that they stay in place over your ears when lying (I didn't realize how much I appreciated this feature until I actually tried it)5.) Although small and light these headphones have a "tight" fit and block out most other extraneous noise in you listening area. (almost like being in a sound proof room)All in all, an excellent set of headphones from a sound quality and comfort wearing point of view. Also, I feel these phones are reasonably priced for the quality (I've tried several other more expensive set from other manufacturers that don't have much more to offer that this unit)

Steven Erikson has done it again; Another great fantasy read!This episode contains new locales and characters (with one exception) in the ongoing "Malazan Book of the Fallen" series.The story alternates between two different regions that are preparing for war with each other. Again we have Erikson's writing talents giving us the intriguing assortment of betrayals, deceit and magic. As well, this tale has some great character development: people(and other beings) that you can readily identify with and care about. There is also a line of developing humour sprinkled throughout the book in the chapters envolving Tehol and Bugg.All in all, fantasy writing at its best. Highly recommended!

A different, dark and brooding fantasy.Traditional fantasy tales (with magic, dragons, elves etc.) when done well, have always been one of my greatest sources of reading pleasure and I'd hoped for this kind of experience with this book. However, this dark, moody psychological tale really did not fit in the category of books that I'd list as one of my favorites. As one review stated, this was an "adult fantasy" and I'd have to agree; it had a dark theme that got just got darker and darker as you went further into this novel.This novel was well written, had good character development and was entertaining (it certainly had the ability to keep you turning the pages), but to me, it was not a pleasant story; far from it. There were sections that almost seemed to drift into paranormal horror (again, not one of my favorite subjects) and as the story picked up momentum there were even a few occasions that were creepy enough to cause me to have flashbacks to "The Blair Witch Project". The latter third of this book I found increasingly tense and I must admit that I was actually relieved to be finally finished this work.The book is extremely well done and although not my favorite kind of fantasy, it still merits a rating of 5 Stars.

This is a comprehensive work about not only Wolfgang, but also his entire family: especially his father, Leopold. It contains an excellent classification list of Mozarts' works by category and also a numerical list by Kochel Numbers. Each chapter has a sizeable list of related notes in the back of the book and the bibliography is also extensive.Although the book is informative and easy to read, I found it a bit repetitious at times (i.e. discussion of Leopold's prolonged influence over Mozart, and also, the ever present preoccupation with money). There were a couple chapters on the meaning of Mozart's music as to how it was affected by events of the time that seem to me to contains a lot of subjective conjecture.On a personal note, I was hoping for some detailed accounts of Mozart's relationship with Saleri and especially, his librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte (who did the libretto for Cosi, Figaro and Don Giovanni). However, although both men are mentioned in this work, there is sparse information on their involvement with Mozart.All in all and enjoyable work.

A well done FPS!.This game is set in the future, with a plot that begins around the time of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. It is a game of intense action, atmosphere and involves some strategy and choices.As with any game there are positives and negatives...let me explainThe Pros:1.)A great selection of weapons and ammo (with the better ones becoming available as you proceed in the game). Some are better than others and some are quite heavy (you have a limit to how much you can carry).2.)Different armor is also available at different points in the game.3.)Realistic "fog of war" occurrences; weapons jam (with increasing frequency as they become worn); your player tires and gets hungry affecting his ability to perform.4.)Great atmosphere; spooky ambient lighting in dark halls and tunnels, in the outdoors you have rain, lightening and night time; and then there are always the unexpected attacks (anywhere) by an assortment of men, animals and mutants.5.)Enemy AI that is realistic: their guns need reloading and occasionally jam; they hide behind objects when shot at; they sneak up from the unseen side; animals attack in packs and from behind while one or two distract you from the front. All in all an enemy that appears to "think" about what it's doing instead of just standing there and blasting away at you.6.)Although the game requires you to the complete main missions to proceed in the game, you can roam around the country side unrestricted. As a bonus, however, there are several side missions that you can do (these are optional and not required to finish the game but may give you substantial rewards in money or items)7.)Easy save and load feature.8.)3 different endings, depending on the choices you make near the end of the game.9.)Some re-playability; you may want to try different endings, side missions and other weapons and armor.10.)Many hours of intense, hectic game play.Cons:1.)You'll need fairly good hardware and lots of RAM to run this game as it was meant to be played.2.)No vehicles to ride for battle or transportation purposes. (and annoyingly, towards the end, you must walk back almost to the starting point to get an important piece of info) or you can't get into the last 2 endings.3.)Maybe, just maybe a little too hard even on novice (especially towards the latter part of the game).4.)You'll need at least 9GB of disc space to load this game.5.)I found there were occasional crashes or freeze ups after long periods of play.Suggestions; (SPOILER)1.)Early on, go to "Dark Valley"; this will give you a chance toa.)obtain a sniper scope (useful a little later) andb.)while here, do a side mission that requires you to "rescue a fighter's friend" (here you'll find, in the same building as the "friend" (but in another room), a piece of great armor and many useful and powerful "artifacts".2.)Take every bandage you find; medkits will heal wounds but do not stop bleeding (and if you don't stop bleeding, well...you bleed to death).Conclusion:This was a game that I really enjoyed (even though the novice level could be a real challenge at times); it featured my favorite type of game, that being, a FPS with some RPG upgrades. If you liked such games as Deus Ex, System Shock or Dark Messiah, I'm sure you'll pleased with this game. 5 Stars.R. Nicholson

"The Kinshield Legacy" is the first of a two book series by K.C. May. The paperback copy is 378 pages in length while the Kindle e-edition is a 591 Kb download.General theme *SPOILERS* (no specific details given)Our hero, Gavin, is in search of clues that will allow him to solve the mystery of the Runes, and if accomplished, allow him to claim the kingship of the land...the irony is that he doesn't want to be king, but of course there are other less honorable and fair-minded people than him that do. The location of these Runes have been known for years, the problem has been to separate the Runes from the 'tablet' they are magically attached to, a task no one has figured out how to accomplish...until now.*END SPOILERS*Impressions:The Pros:1.) entertaining in a light hearted way...just not quite the same intensity you get from reading G.R.R.Martin or Joe Abercrombie. But that being said, the latter part of this novel had all the intensity I could ask for.2.) there is compelling quality about this tale...it creeps up on you and keeps you reading.The Cons:1.) there are several segments that I felt lacked depth; the atmosphere, that sense of tension and foreboding...qualities that, at least to me, are needed to truly define great fantasy writing.2.) areas that I found, well in a word, predictable.For instance one entire chapter is taken up with a situation that was obvious from the beginning. A wife tell her husband not to tell a secret; he goes to the tavern...he gets drinking and guess what? You knew he was going to blab it out, yet a whole chapter was constructed (dare I say wasted) to tell the reader what was apparent at the outset to everyone.3.) some inane conversations, e.g. the conversation between Gavin and Daia while traveling together.4.) decisions to do (or not do) things that made a straight forward objective confusing or resulted in putting oneself or one's group in jeopardy.5.) no map...a tale geographically diverse enough to warrant one.6.) names for some the characters in this book...like Enamaeria, Cirang, JNese, Nasharla or Saecan. Begging the question...why does the author ( and others as well) feel the need to populate the book with names that are almost unpronounceable?Conclusion:Despite my perceived flaws, I liked this tale and I liked it more the deeper I got into it.Overall, this is good fantasy...just not great fantasy. But there were moments of promise.Would I read the second and final book...yes!3 1/2 Stars.Ray Nicholson

The action begins on D-day (June 6, 1944) and then progresses onward as the allies gradually recapture the German occupied territory in Normandy, France. The game has some historical accuracy; with regards to the events occurring around the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath.As with most games there were good and not so good features...let me explainThe Pros:1.)The game was fun to play; the battles certainly are gut wrenching and tend to sweep you up emotionally into them.2.)Good maps, with clear cut instructions as to what needs to be done to complete a mission.3.)Easy to program your units to build troops, vehicles and armored units etc.4.)Many advanced abilities are available to choose from, by spending your Experience Points, (earned in battles) for upgrades.5.)Easy, anytime game saves.6.)Interesting cut movie scenes before and after each mission.The Cons:1.)During the chaos of battle, I found it very difficult to accurately control some units; either getting them to go where I wanted them to go AND/OR do what I wanted them to do. Because there were often multiple units (represented by icons) close together it was sometimes hard to accurately click on the appropriate icon with the CORRECT mouse button. Probably the worst example of this was to try to get a manned artillery cannon pointed the right way and then get them to fire on a specific target. (while all hell was breaking loose and you needed that cannon in a hurry).2.)A limited total number of units (total units encompass personnel + buildings + vehicles) at any one time, on any given mission. I seemed to be forever at my unit limits with no way of producing a set of tanks to help my buildings or troops that were being ravaged by German Panther and Tiger tanks. (In other words. I had to let many troops die in order to free up 'space' to make some heavy armor units).3.)However, the most frustrating thing to me was the spontaneous regeneration of German armor or troops in an area you just spent a half hour clearing. (and of course you won these battles by the skin of your teeth with barely any troops or armor left).4.)The tutorial, while it gives the bare basics of game play; has very little in-depth instruction.5.)The computer AI running the enemy could do anything, anywhere and all at once; where as you, the gamer, can only act in one place, on one unit at a time. Hardly seems fair.6.)Picking an upgrade (by spending your hard earned Exp. Points) seemed a trial and error affair; what worked well in one mission, may be of limited use or even useless in another (often, with the end result being restarting level to try to find something more useful).A decent RTS war game, that had great potential, but, I felt, just fell short. I found myself continually frustrated by my inadequate, one-click-of-the-mouse-button-at-a-time response, compared to the all encompassing AI that ran the enemy. 3 Stars.R. NicholsonP.S. As an alternative RTS World War II game, I would suggest "War Front". Although not as historically accurate as CoH, (it also had some 'what if' scenarios thrown in as well), but it at least had a set-up that allowed the 'gamer' more control over the production and deployment of his troops, buildings and armor.

A series produced by the BBC and narrated by Dr David Attenborough; it turns out to be an electrifying testament to Planet Earth. Technically, the 5 DVD's are excellent; great video and superb audio.This is a series that basically spans the globe bringing us stunning visual accounts of the wildlife on our world; in the air, on land and under the oceans, from pole to pole, from desert to tropical forests. There are moments ranging from motherly tenderness to stunning hunts of predators and prey; some will leave you breathless.Each DVD tends to deal with a particular area or topic. One doesn't have to delve far into the first disc to realize that someone, somewhere has spent countless hours (mostly just waiting for the right moment) to obtain these unique and unbelievable shots/films.My highlight of the entire series was from disc one; an immense great white shark (previously hidden beneath the surface of the ocean), leaps completely out of the water to devour a poor unsuspecting seal. This spectacle is presented to you, the viewer, in slow motion; the actual event is stunningly quick, violent and takes place within less then two seconds. Talk about being at the right spot at the right time (unless your the seal, of course), to actually film this incredible footage. .Conclusion:A 5 DVD collection; professionally filmed, edited and narrated. It will make you aware of the beauty, yet savage potential that encompasses some of the less traversed areas of our home planet. 5 Stars...more if I could.R. Nicholson

Even better then the first book!J.V Jones' 2nd book in the 'Sword of Shadows' series is simply a great fantasy/adventure read.The story continues where book I left off and follows sequentially Raif, Ash and Effie; their stories take some interesting twists and turns throughout the course of this book. The terrain is the same basic bleak winter tundra (although spring appears to be coming) of the first book.One of the many strong points of this novel is the deliberate pacing of this story and its telling. Then add to this a great basic story, plus an author's with the ability to weave a good tale, and you end up with a memorable fantasy work. And although different in various ways, this work, at times, conjures up memories of the writing quality and techniques found in George R.R. Martin's 'Iced and Fire' series and Joe Abercrombie's 'The First Law' trilogy. (see P.S. below)The only niggling complaint would be that the map (and in fairness, the one provided is fairly good) could have provided a little more detail; details that give some names or markings as to where our protagonist were located during some of their journeys. I realize this is probably a 'personal' concern, but I've always liked to have a sense of position and of distance/proximity to other geographic locales when reading fantasy/adventure; it just makes the prolonged treks easier to visualize in my mind.Conclusion:A 2nd book in this series that is of the highest order; a great story, superbly told. 5 Stars.Ray NicholsonP.S.I defy anyone not be moved to the point of being emotionally distraught by chapter 5 in this book. A subjective opinion...certainly; but read this one chapter and see how it affects you.

I purchased this headset with microphone to play some on-line PC games (namely 'Left 4 Dead').This unit is connected to your computer via a USB port (rather than standard 'jack' on your audio card) and has volume adjustment in the connecting cord.The head phones are padded making them comfortable to wear for prolonged sessions and the microphone is the boom-type attachment so it can be swung up or down to give the best results for audio input.The configuration in 'Control Panel' provides that you use either your regular speakers OR these headphone/microphone, but not both at the same time. This is a great feature as it allows me to slaughter countless aliens without the noise of guns and explosions disturbing the rest of the household late into the night...I mean, who else is going to keep the free world free, right? ;-)Conclusion:A well made headset/microphone that typifies a 'Boys and their Toys' attitude to perfection. 5 StarsRay Nicholson

A wonderful book by Yann Martel.Winner of the Man Booker prize and finalist for The Governor General's Award and The Commonwealth Writers Prize.An easy to read, compelling work of fiction that is almost impossible to put down. Martel's character, Pi, is from India and has typical English based, down to earth sense of humor, that lends itself perfectly to the telling of this tale. It is realistic to the point that you begin to think " mmm, maybe this is based on a true event! ". You exult in his highs and despair during his low moments: but you never doubt his instincts for survival.All in all a most enjoyable work: Highly recommended !

An extraordinary CD.This disc has two great violin Concertos: Brahm's and Stravinsky's, both in D major.As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the Stravinsky is exceptionally well played. Although this piece is not as pleasing to the ear (at least to my ear) as the Brahm's, one has to appreciate the amount of effort and skill that is put forth by Ms. Hahn for this difficult work.Without doubt the Brahm's concerto was my favorite: I found Hahn's interpretation flawless. While I loved the first movement, played with all the power and grandeur that I think Brahm had intended, it was the third movement that absolutely captivated my attention. This allegro, with its beautiful, haunting melody is made even more incredible when accompanied and embellished by the orchestra. The work was played with such joyous abandon and energy that it was hard to believe it was over so soon... Breathtaking!A must have CD if you love Brahm's violin concerto in D major....Highly recommended!

As my title suggests, much, much less than I'd expected.Having just finished "The Book Thief" by the same author, I could hardly wait to get my hands this book; unfortunately they are as different as night and day.The book had an intriguing cover and the story started reasonably enough, but then quickly became unbelievable with unlikely clues and convenient solutions. Then, to make matters worse, the ending is even more far-fetched than the main story itself. About half way through, I found myself starting to skim the chapters (not a good sign) just to get finished faster.As I sit and write this review I find it hard to believe that the genius that penned "The Book Thief" (a book so deeply moving and beautiful that I was saddened to see it end) was the same person who wrote this book of such...of such questionable quality.All in all, I wished I'd passed on this book. 1 StarAddendum; Aug.18, 2007Having read other peoples' reviews on this book, I wonder if they've read "The Book Thief" by the same author. That book, IMHO, is so superior to 'I Am the Messenger' that I still find it hard to believe that both novels were written by the same person.However, in trying to be objective, I've tried to put myself in the position of what I would have thought of 'I Am the Messenger ', IF, I'd not read 'The Book Thief ' first. Honestly, I feel I probably would not have trashed 'I Am the Messenger' as I did in my review, but still could not give it anymore than 2 stars.But, having read 'The Book Thief' first, I stand by my critical review of 'I Am the Messenger '.

This is a magnificent novel by Sue Monk Kidd.The story takes place during the time of the Civil Rights Act in the mid 1960's. The heroine is a teenage white girl named Lily who has previously lost her mother under somewhat mysterious circumstances and then, after years of abuse, runs away from an exceptionally cruel father. The bulk of the story takes place after Lily has been taken in and cared for by 3 black sisters, one of which is a beekeeper: it is at this point her "education" begins.Each chapter in the book is prefaced by a short statement about the life in a beehive (thus the name of the novel): then the following chapter will, in some way, parallel Lily's story with that previous statement about the bees. A unique concept but one that works very well in this setting.The book is extremely well written, captivating and is a roller coaster ride of emotions as Lily's situation changes with her development. The author has exceptional abilities to present to the reader what Lily is actually thinking that is, to me at least, so realistic, so " right on the mark" , that you could not help be enamored by the heroine and her slow, soul searching maturation and awareness.A must read! Highly recommended. It's just hard to imagine that this masterpiece didn't win some literary award.

La Boheme:What an unbelievable work by Puccini: surely the opening theme must be one of the greatest melodies of all time. It moves me near to tears: To think anyone could imagine music this beautiful and be able to write it down for others to hear for time eternal.The scene is Paris 1957. The 2 main actors are young and handsome: someone you could really believe to be falling in love. But the best parts are the acting qualities of the singers and what voices!!!!In particular, David Hobson as Rodolfo: his rendition of "che gelida manina" will make the hair on the back of the neck stand up and salute! When done well, it must be one of a handful of great tenor arias in all of opera.Cheryl Baker does an excellent job as Mimi. A great voice and her death scene in the end is very moving.This production done by the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra is a fine example of an excellent use of people and resources. Filmed before a live audience (really the only way great opera should be recorded) we actually see stagehands moving the sets, and yet they do not distract from the magic that is happening but instead are part of the drama unfolding before you.The only unrealistic part of the entire performance was the audience: Silent, except for an occasional cough, they sat on their hands if they were watching paint dry. Did they not see the unbelievable performances that were unfolding before them? I mean, is that not the purpose of live theatre??: Audience reaction to great performances: If I had been an actor on that stage I would have been so disappointed: wondering what we were doing wrong. Maybe the audience was instructed not to clap or shout until the end of a scene, but if that is the case why even bother to perform it live.A wonderful disc; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

A great read!This is the second book in " The Prince of Nothing " series. It chronicles the adventures/misadventures of the Holy War as it slowly advances southward toward its ultimate goal at Shimeh.We see several characters that rose to the fore in Book 1 continue to dominate the main story of Book 2: those persons being Kellhus, Achamian, Cnaiur, Esmi, and Serwe, but we also keep in close contact with a host of other major participants we meet in the initial book.I found the story, after a somewhat slow start, a real page-turner. The descriptive prose was of the highest quality, especially Bakker's ability to describe the subtle textures and colors of surrounding environments. I really liked his use of the inserted italic word to show what people were really thinking even though their actual conversation may indicate something completely different.My only complaint for this second book was what I felt was the overuse of profanity in what seemed to me, unwarranted places. Also, all the women in this book, and to some degree in the first book, seem to be sexually exploited on either a consensual or violate basis.All in all, despite the few concerns mentioned above, a fabulous follow up to the first book. Although there is no specific mention of another book in the series, one would have to assume that there is more to come that will clear up some major loose ends that finish up this book.

This is one of those books that I could hardly wait to get a free minute or two to continue reading. It is the first of a series and I'm itching for the next volume to come out (expected sometime quite soon, in fact)The first part of this book reminded me a lot of Frank Herbert's "Dune": that being, a rather diverse, confusing, "I wondering what's going on here", beginning: and like "Dune", your patience is rewarded as the individual pieces eventually get pulled together, making for one great story.The story itself is fresh and intriguing; with plots and subplots involving individuals and also on a more global scale. There is a wealth of interesting characters and substantial character development. You will find war, revenge, deception, journeys, and an erotic sexy quality to the sporadic love scenes: all of which make this novel very readable and addicting.If you liked the style of story telling you found in "Dune" or if you just like great fantasy writing, I would recommend this novel.

A beautiful DVD!This disc has the best of everything: my favorite tenor (Andrea Bocelli), my favorite conductor (Myung-Wung Chung) performing at the magnificent Basilica of Santa Marie sopra Minerva in Rome. Accompanying the principals are the Orchestra and Chorus of the National Academy of Di Santa CeciliaAlthough you take for granted that the quality of the singing and the music will be first class, it is however, the excellence of the camera work and the editing that really makes this recording a cut above the rest. The video not only includes close-ups of all participants and many panoramic views both inside and outside the church, but it also seems to be able to capture the essence of the spirituality that the music and the surroundings are trying to convey. There are, for instance, several touchingly beautiful shots of Bocelli and Chung together, both so enraptured by the music that they seem to be oblivious to their surroundings.Simply put, although the music of this DVD is predominantly sacred, I think that any music lover will find something in this disc that will move them and bring a sense of peace and joy to their hearts.

This work by Sheila Hodges is a biography of the man who was the librettist for three of Mozart's most famous operas: Le Nozzi di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi Fan Tutte.The book traces Lorenzo Da Ponte's life from birth in Ceneda, Italy in 1749 to his death in America in 1838. The material used in this biography include Da Ponte's own memoirs and various others letters and text that documented his life in Europe and America. In the back, the book list chronologically dates that of were of importance to Da Ponte, dates of his writings (poems, letters etc.) and finally dates of his libretti. There is also an extensive bibliography and a complete index of the names of people in the book who were part of his life.The book deals extensively with all sections of Da Ponte's life including his growing up, his work in Vienna, (where he met Mozart and worked for Emperor Joseph), his life in London, and finally his last years in America. Among these segments we see a young man who could not resist the fairer sex; a gullible soul who repeatedly lent money to people and rogues that could not or would not repay him, thus leaving him in an almost constant state of poverty throughout his entire lifetime. As that saying goes "he was his own worse enemy".Personally, I had hoped to gain some insight into the working relationship between himself and Mozart but there is apparently little record of their actual association. What did come out, that is intriguing, is the apparent sway Da Ponte's skill with the libretti had in determining the music that Mozart eventually wrote for the three operas mentioned above. This ability seemed to arise from his upbringing and his education as a young man, where eventually he developed his talent to write these fabulous Italian libretti: libretti that were not only used by Mozart, but by many other composers of the day, including Salieri and Martin Y Soler, just to mention a few. It appears plausable, that without Da Ponte's influence on Mozart, that these three masterpieces would be substantially different than what we know today.The book is well written, generally easy to read and will be appreciated by anyone interested in Da Ponte, Italian opera or the political intrigues of life in 18th century Vienna. Certainly a special interest book, but one that is an fascinating read.

Book 8 in the Dresden File series; another fine addition to Jim Butcher's ongoing series featuring wizard/detective Harry Dresden.Something unusual is happening at a local horror film festival and Harry is asked to check it out. From there Harry, Murph, Bob (everyone's favorite, well OK mine at least, libidinous skull), Thomas and Mouse (his dog) go from bystanders to main combatants as they delve into the ever expanding 'Horror' situation.This is my 4th Dresden novel and it continues to use the same simplistic format that has worked well with the rest of the entire series. The outline of this story is identical to the previous books; Harry gets involved with an unusual occurrence, Harry discovers an underlying sinister plot, Harry faces astronomical odds against survival, and finally Harry saves the day. But instead of a rather boring rehash, each new work brings something fresh to the table that provides an unexpected, pleasant revelation of sorts.Conclusion:Basically, I like Harry and the host of other characters that Jim Butcher has produced in this entertaining series. The story is fun, fast paced and keeps those pages turning. And for light read, who could ask for more than that.Ray Nicholson

An enthusiastic 2 thumbs up for this unit!I've had the Sportster for about a month now and I couldn't be happier. Let me elaborate...1.)This unit has the advantage of 30 slots of memory for 30 different radio stations. All available at the click of a button on the unit or the remote.2.)Pause/Rewind. You can pause any broadcast and then get up to 44 minutes playback. If you used the save feature you can also fast-forward to skip items your not interested in.3.)You can save up to 20 song titles to memory. Anytime one of these songs in played anywhere on Sirius Radio you will be notified so you can listen if you want to.4.)Good quality stereo FM sound that is uninterrupted unless you go through tunnels or behind buildings.5.)All the NFL, NBA, NHL etc. All live and you can set up this unit to notify you when your team/broadcast begins. (And with the save feature you can listen to your team score that touchdown again and again.)6.)Fully functioning remote. Actually this is the best way to change channels while in your car (the buttons on the unit are small and may be difficult to use safely while driving if the Sportster is on the car dash).7.)Easy setup of antenna and suctioned docking unit for the receiver (removable) for in car use. (Suction works great if moisten before applying.)8.)There is a kit available to use the unit in your house* One important negative;The magnetic antenna that attaches to your car hood or roof will scratch the paint IF you repeatedly remove it (for instance, to prevent theft while going into a store). I had to cover the bottom of the antenna with a sticky-back cloth tape to prevent direct contact with the paint of my car. (this did not cause problems with the antenna's magnetic function as the magnet is so strong it still stuck to the metallic surface with no difficulty)All in all a satellite radio that I've enjoyed much more than I anticipated. For the extra bucks you get a lot of extra features, which, if you listen to a lot of radio, is a good value. Recommended!

A very good read.This is a true story that begins in Afghanistan in the mid seventies. It follows the members of an upper middle class family as they struggle to survive in their homeland; survive, despite a series of ever increasingly ruthless dictators, the Russian invasion and finally the Taliban.This book is beautifully written and easy to read; it has a wonderful descriptive quality to it that has the ability to provoke strong emotions. The book was hard to put down; I found myself wanting to read "just on more page, one more chapter".This story has an universal theme; it could be viewed as a testament to all common, oppressed people anywhere; people who'd like nothing more than to live in peace, but are prevented from doing so (through no fault of their own), because they get caught up in events caused by the ever changing whims of the "dictator de jour." Highly recommended. 5 Stars.

Overall, a well done and interesting game!I had some serious reservations about this game early on. Initially, it was just about impossible to get killed, making the game extremely simplistic and, in a word, boring. This "flaw" lasted only 2-3 levels at which point things became much more interesting and complex.There were several pros and a few cons...The Pros:1.)Reasonably good graphics and audio.2.)A variety of weapons and components (most of which have significant upgrade potential). However, you only have a limited amount of upgrade points ("salvage"), so choosing the right upgrade is important, as it can significantly impact your abilities.3.)Some First Person Shooter (FPS) capabilities when using a bunkered machine gun or flak cannon.4.)A couple of extended episodes of FPS that involves you controlling a gun from a moving vehicle.5.)A really satisfying sniper component to this game.6.)A brutal finale; it took me a couple of days to get through this on "hard"; you have to use nearly all your "skills", but above all, you need to have patience to complete this level.7.)Some replayability; although the game challenges would be the same, you could try doing it with a completely different set of weapons and upgrades.Cons:1.)3rd person shooter vs. FPS, but the game (after the first couple of very easy levels) was so good, I didn't even notice the difference after a while.2.)Game could only be restarted (when loading or after dying) from the beginning of the level or a specified checkpoints. No quick-saves! And then, once a level was finished, you could not replay it until you finished the entire game (at this point you could replay any level you wanted)3.)The AI of the majority of the enemies was, at best, fair; they showed limited abilities to protect themselves when under fire, usually making them easy targets. (but thankfully, there were a few that were a real challenge)4.)Linear game play, with only some limited ability to deviate from the main path of completing your objectives. (with a compass arrow always pointing the way to proceed)In summary; a game I almost quit because it appeared, initially, too easy. It turned out to be a fun 3rd person shooter with some RPG upgrades. 5 Stars

A stunning operatic DVD!This DVD was recorded live at the open air Waldbuhne amphitheater in Berlin on July 7, 2006. It features Placido Domingo, Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon with Marco Armiliato conducting the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin. The program featured a medley of cherished operatic staples.20,000 people got to witness one superb performance after another on this pleasant summer's evening; what thrill it must have been to have actually been there. Domingo, looking grayer and somewhat older, has lost none of his voice over the years nor any of his passion; he seemed a comfortable fit for the rising stars of Netrebko and Villazon.Highlight of the disc:So many to choose from, so obviously a subjective choice; but I'd have to pick Netrobko and Villazon (as Mimi and Rodolfo) singing the love duet ' O soave fanciulla ' from Puccini's "La Boheme". Being a sentimentalist, this piece has always had a emotional effect on me, but none much stronger than rendition performed here. Stirring to watch.And finally, and I guess it goes without saying, but you really need a decent stereo system to appreciate this disc; I initially played this DVD through a friend's TV speakers and the quality (sound) was disappointing to say the least. However on a home theater system the full, rich quality of the music was evident. 5 Stars, more if I could.R. Nicholson

I purchased this External DVD re-writer to copy a business program that needed frequent backup.This unit seemed to work fine playing DVD movies, etc, however this was not my main use I had intended for this machine.The problems I encountered were as follows;1.) When I copied the my program onto the DVD for backup purposes, I had difficulty recopying it back to my computer; it wouldn't do it reliably and frequently crashed.2.) When I tried to rewrite over an old program (i.e. update the same program but with new information) on the DVD it wouldn't (although it asked me if I wanted to and I said yes). So I had to erase the entire DVD before I tried to copy a new file on the DVD disc.3.) After I erased the DVD, that disc would not accept a new file being copied to it; the EZ-Dub kept asking me to put a disc in the drive, although there was one already there.(the one I just erased)I ended up taking this unit back as I could not seem to get a consistent working response from this machine.

This is Tchaikovsky's ballet performed by the Kirov Ballet on it's Canadian tour in 1989; it contains all the ingredients to make it a spectacular success. It has, for instance, the creme de la creme of the Kirov principal dancers; Larisa Lezhnina, Farukh Ruzimatov and Yulia Makhalina. Then add to this the beautiful backdrop scenery, working fountains, huge chandeliers , sumptuous costumes for all its participants, and you'd have a production of " The Sleeping Beauty" to die for, right....well not quite. Let me explain.Having watched this DVD performance a couple of times, I have this gut feeling that when choreographer, Marius Petipa, saw the original score for this ballet, his initial though must have been, "my God, what I'm I going to do with these people for over 2+ hours." Despite all the positives I've mentioned above, I honestly feel that not even all this onstage beauty and talent (not to mention an incredible effort by both Lezhnina and Ruzimatov) could justify this slow paced, sometimes repetitive work. Some of the dances (excluding those of the principals) seem have little to do with the overall story: In fact, the Prologue seemed to be dragged out and some of this area of the ballet could have been significantly shortened. I must admit that during some segments, I had difficulty keeping my attention focused on this performance.All in all, a beautifully staged and exquisitely danced production that is superbly recorded (both audio and video) but it is, simply put, too long.Ray NicholsonP.S.Jan 2011As commenter John Beal noted below, apparently the choreography was done before the musical score. I guess second paragraph sympathies go to Tchaikovsky instead of Petipas.

The Marriage of Figaro on this DVD is a good one, boasting fine acting and splendid voices.The production is done at the Opera National de Lyon with its small and intimate stage and is performed before a live audience. Paolo Olmi conducts the orchestra. The sets have an attractive pastel quality without being overdone and the costumes fit the period for which the work was written. Also, the camera angles and video switching is well done.This opera was one of three where Mozart used Lorenzo Da Ponte for the libretto and with the same results: a plot full of twists, suspense and surprises. Add to the words, the great music of Mozart, and you have a winning combination.Stellar performances by Giovanni Furlanetto as Figaro, Elzbeta Szymtka as Suzanne, Ludovic Tezier as the count, Janice Watson as the Countessa and Francesca Provvisionato as Cheribino highlight the opera.Although this cast does not have the blockbuster stars to sing the leading roles, it does have actors and actresses that seem to have a special sexy chemistry with each other that makes for a wonderful presentation. They are young, vibrant, enthusiastic and committed to the roles they are portraying onstage and yet at the same time seem to be having a great deal of fun.A wonderful production of "Le Nozze": one you will be happy to have in your collection of great opera.

Multiple cameras positioned to give multiple angles; capturing everything from panorama views of the orchestra to individual players...even some of the finger work of the violinists and pianist. The colors and clarity are crisp throughout even though these recordings are from the early-mid 90s. The audio is in Dolby digital 2 ch.Comments:I enjoy these type of recordings...I find that I usually benefit from 2 things...First, if I'm really lucky, I get to discover a piece of music with which I was previously unfamiliar, that being in this case, the Paganini Violin Concerto #1...played with great expression and sensitivity by Sarah Chang.Second, I get reaquainted with an old favorite...in this case Beethoven's Fidelio Overture. Fidelio is pure Beethoven. It is the perfect example of why I love Beethoven...it has that powerful, driving, pulsating pace surrounding moments of comparative quietness. This performance of Fidelio was conducted by Zubin Mehta (and who has more fun conducting that Zubin Mehta). This piece brought back a host of wonderful memories relating to my discovery of classical music way back when...and especially my introduction to Beethoven.Thank you Kultur and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra...5 Stars.Ray Nicholson

Having just finished watching The Civil War by Ken Burns I felt I had to review it. The DVD, on 6 discs, encompass the entire civil war from beginning to end, including important events that preceded the firing of the first shot.In the end, the union won of course, but was somewhat lucky to do so: despite continually squandering the advantage of numerical superiority and the innumerable opportunities they had for victory.Although it is difficult to describe what so compelling and addictive about this work, I believe, one of the factors is the beauty of the story telling. The main portion of the series in simply nothing more than old black and white photographs captured by photographers of the day; images with a ghostly, grainy quality that makes for a special eerie affect. I do not think colored pictures, somehow, would have been effective in creating the mood that these B &W; photos do: simple images of men in their barracks, in front of a tent, on a horse etc. or sometimes grotesque scenes of death and destruction after a battle. The fact that so many of these images survived is a miracle in itself.Just as important is the beautiful, narrative voice of David McCullough and others historians who give expert commentary and actors who read letters written by people involved in this event.However, in my opinion, it is the music that sets this epic event apart from any other work on the same topic. The Ashoken Farewell by Jay Ungar begins each installment: it is hard to imagine a more fitting piece of music that could preface each episode: this haunting melody, played by a solo violin, seems to capture the raw essence of the story so perfectly: it simply seems to reach out and touch the soul. The majority of the music accompanying the story is played by solo guitar, piano, banjo or violin: and again the singular instrument seems much more appropriate than orchestrated music: capturing the ever increasing loneliness and solitude that these men must have felt as the war dragged on throughout these four years.All in all, the photographs, the narrative, and the music blend together to make an unforgettable 10 hour series that surly is one of the most important events not only in American history, but maybe even more importantly, for the entire world.

'A Man Betrayed', is the second book in the trilogy of 'The Book of Words' by J.V. Jones.It continues where the first book left off, and sequentially follow the main players, that being Jack and Melli, Tawl and Nabber, Baralis and Maybor, and Tavalisk and Gamil. In addition there are several other characters that come into contact with the above mentioned, that have a major influence on the outcome of certain situations.As with most great fantasy stories there are liberal doses of magic, conflicts, deceit and betrayals, unexpected twist and turns, and even some budding romances. Jones is a great story teller and spins a tale that is fasted paced and continually changing. In addition she is able to continually develop her protagonists, making them characters you could really like/dislike, as the case may be.So why only 4 Stars....let me explainFor fantasy to really work well, it must be believable (yes I know, an oxymoron if there ever was one), And with this in mind, there were few times during the telling of this tale that I had some minor concerns regarding this perceived believable/unbelievable issue; a few occasions that I had to stop and say 'hmmm...that seemed a somewhat unusual occurrence/reaction/happening at this particular time'. Mind you, these were a minor distraction to an otherwise terrific plot and narration by the author, but yet did detract from the overall excellence of this book.Conclusion:A terrific second book in the trilogy; a real page turner. Jones is an exceptional writer with that elusive knack of story telling, and what more could any fantasy reader want.Ray Nicholson

Another wonderful DVD from Euroarts!This recording is of the gala concert to commemorate Mozart's 250th birthday (and not surprisingly it is an all Mozart affair), beginning with the Overture to Don Giovanni, followed by the Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra (featuring Sharon Kam, playing the basset clarinet) and closing with the Symphony No. 38 "Prague".The concert was recorded at the Estates Theatre in Prague on Jan 27th, 2006. This is a small, horseshoe shaped theater that has a series of 5 stacked loge boxes surrounding and rising above the main audience floor; to say the decor is opulent would be a gross understatement. The concert is played by the Czech Philharmonic under the skillful baton of Manfred Honeck. Interestingly enough, all three pieces performed at this concert had their first performances at this very same venue in the late 1780's and early 1790's.The city of Prague was very special to Mozart as it was here that his music seemed to be most appreciated by the nobility and the public in general; here he received accolades the he could only dream of in Vienna. Thus it is not surprising that Mozart chose to honor Prague with these first performances; the city and its inhabitants were obviously very special to him.Highlight of the disc:While the Overture and the "Prague" symphony were expertly played with pace, feeling and enthusiasm, it was, Sharon Kam, the soloist for the clarinet concerto, who provided the highlight of this DVD. Kam is a clarinetist extraordinaire, and she uses a basset clarinet (instead of the usual clarinet in A) for this performance. This is the same type of instrument that was used in the original performance in 1791; it has a slightly lower range than the clarinet in A and Kam is able to use her instrument to perfection, giving the bass notes a rich, velvety tone. Simply magnificent to watch as well as hear.The disc is recorded beautifully; featuring great camera angles and superb audio. It was then professionally edited and transcribed to disc; this DVD is of the highest quality.Negatives?...well, yes one...the audience's response to this concert. What I discovered on this disc were three magnificently performed works (especially the solo by Sharon Kam) and yet the reception by those in attendance that night, might at best, be described as...subdued; a token of almost "ho-hum" appreciation. In other words...polite applause, just long enough to not be considered rude. From my perspective (the DVD) I saw a performance that was simply stellar; well, I can still offer my own "bravos" and "bravas" from the comfort of my home.Simply a magnificent DVD; anyone who loves Mozart, or just good classical music will want to have for their collection. 5 Stars...more if I could.

This is a well-researched book by Robbins Landon not only giving a detailed glimpse of Mozart in 1791 but also the ongoing intrigues associated with life in late 18th century Vienna. Discussed in detail are the three main compositions that he completed during this final year: those being, The Magic Flute, La Clemenza di Tito and his Requiem. There is an interesting section on Mozart's death and the myths and suspicions associated with his final illness. The last chapter is devoted to Constanze and her struggles to survive after Mozart's death.The book has extensive reference notes, a detailed bibliography and an index that list people who were part of Mozart's life during this period. Also included are some interesting sketches of Mozart's apartment and an area map of Vienna where he and Constanze live in during his last year.What I personally found of interest, resulted from the extra measures that Robbins Landon goes to give added details on some topics (in particular the 3 works mentioned above). Insights as to the sequencing of construction, participation of other people and outside distractions that influenced Mozart's ability to work on and complete these projects. For example: the fact that 5 different types of sheet paper were used by Mozart during the writing of "La Clemenza di Tito" gives clues not only as to the actual chronological order that some of the scenes were composed, but also an idea as to the geographic locales where different parts this opera was conceived. i.e. Prague or ViennaIt seems hard to believe that retrieving accurate material on Mozart's life and music would be difficult, given his fame. You'd just assume that every note (musical or otherwise) that he wrote would have been recorded for the sake of posterity: sadly, such is not the case. Although Mozart was regarded as a brilliant musician during his time he was only recognized for his true genius, posthumously. So, although a lot of the musical scores, letters, writings and conversation have survived, many were lost or went missing over the past 200 years. What a pity!Well written and informative. This is certainly a book of special interest, but one that goes beyond the superficial discussions of Mozart's life. Recommended!

A disappointing finish to this intriguing trilogy.J.V.Jones had shown herself to be a skilled storyteller and a developing writer with the first two books. The basic story is great throughout...a classic fantasy tale based on the ongoing struggle between good and evil. This installment continues to follow the converging tales of our two main protagonists, Jack (the baker's boy) and Tawl (the Valdis knight).The series started off well in the first installment and continued nicely into the second book, but somehow this book seems to have lost something...not so much with the basic story, but rather with some areas of its execution...let me explain.1.)There are many flashbacks (in fact too many), referring to a previous time involving Tawl's disastrous relationship with this sisters.2.)There were some conversation between characters seem somehow scripted and forced; conversation that didn't seem to go anywhere, leaving the reader with the feeling that the author was writing 'fill'.3.)There are instances of people doing really questionable things, resulting in them unnecessarily, being put in harms way.4.)And as I noted in my review of the second book, there were happenings and occurrences that just seemed unlikely, given the situation at hand.5.)There were times of unrealistic cruelty in several areas, that again seemed a little overdone and thus making it somewhat unbelievable.6.)And finally, the book became more laden with the above mentioned perceived shortcomings as the end approached; in truth it was all I could do to finish this work. It got to the point where I started skimming some areas because I was bored and just wanted to get finished.Conclusion:Although Jones has an easy to read and likeable writing style, this last book, unfortunately, has resulted in some of the luster being lost from the entire trilogy. However, if you can ignore the drop in quality, especially during the latter third of this last book, this is still an overall engaging and rewarding fantasy adventure. 2 to 2 1/2 Stars for this book; 4 Stars for the entire trilogy.Ray Nicholson

A thoroughly enjoyable fantasy adventure from J.V.Jones. This book, the first of a trilogy, was penned in the mid 90's. I came across it after having read the author's more recent 'Ice' novels.In many ways this earlier effort, although not quite as well written*, is more enjoyable to read than the more recent "Ice" series. This story flows a little better and the mood and geographical surroundings are not so bleak and dark as Jones' latest effort.This is the story of Jack who is an apprentice to the castle baker. But unbeknown to Jack, he has some magical abilities that he is unaware of, but soon to discover; abilities and powers that are jealously coveted by others. Throw in some clandestine plotting, interesting quests and some flirty romancing and the real tale of 'The Baker's Boy' unfolds. In addition, there are several other characters with side stories that are just as intriguing as Jack's, and that are of course, remotely related.Conclusion:A great novel; a well written and captivating fantasy adventure. I'm looking forward to the next 2 installments of this trilogy. Easily 5 Stars.Ray Nicholson*P.S.The one thing I did notice was that although Jones' story telling has remained first rate covering the span from this initial book to the more recent series, the quality of the prose in the 'Ice' has improved from this earlier work...let me explain...some sentences in this initial book have a short, abrupt quality to them, resulting in almost a 'bullet' like, point by point effect. And although this doesn't detract from the magical tale that Jones has to tell us, it just doesn't read as 'smoothly as the more recent 'Ice' books. However overall, this is a minor complaint.

I actually enjoyed this game more than the original full version Half Life 2.Pros:1.) Lots of action with Gordon and Alyx trying to get out of City 17.2.) Great graphic and sound if you have the system to run them properly.3.) The last 1/2 of the game is an example of FPS gaming at its best. Wonderful! Lets hope for more of this in episode two.4.) Comes on a DVD, so the install is fairly quick.Cons:1.) Because it comes on a DVD, you'll need a DVD player on your computer.2.) Then after the DVD install, you are automatically sent to "Steam" where you must download the entire game again from the internet. I'm fortunate enough to have a fast internet connection, but if you have to use dial up, forget it; it would take forever and probably turn you off so much you'd never enjoy the game. (Thus a loss of one star on the "overall game" rating)3.) You need a good CPU and video card to enjoy the game or else you may have turn down some of the video options to get the game to run without clipping.All in all, despite my concerns, this game is a winner, and worth the reasonable purchase price. I can hardly wait for the next installment.

Another fabulous DVD from EuroartsThis disc, featuring the Berlin Philharmonic Symphony (BPO), is one of a series that has been recorded in May of each year from various European locales (To commemorate the founding of the BPO on May 1, 1882). This recording, in 2002, is from the glorious Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Sicily, with the BPO under the baton of Claudio Abbado.The composers featured are the finest the 18th and 19th centuries had to offer; Beethoven (Egmont Overture), Brahms ( Violin concerto in D with Gil Shaham*), Drovak (Symphony # 9, From the New World) and Verdi (Sicilian Vespers)Everything about this DVD is top notch...let me elaborateThe setting is sumptuous; the newly renovated (1997) Teatro Massimo is a show piece of consummate proportions. It has six levels of private wall lodges surrounding the entire outer edge of the main floor; this would make for spectacular, private viewing. The domed ceiling, with its hand painted, petal shaped design, is as much an attraction as the theater itself. How proud the people of Palermo must be of this magnificent structure.The video is superbly done. There are close ups of individuals and instruments as well as panoramic views of the orchestra and also the inside of the theater itself. The editing reflects a knowledge of the music being played as evidenced by the switching of the camera to the most appropriate view; this was done with impeccable timing and great effect.The audio: simply superb! Enough said.The performance: As good as I could ever have hoped for; and what a bonus to have these 4 masterpieces on one DVD. It would be near impossible to pick one piece as the best on the disc; they are all that well done.All in all, Euroarts has produced a recording that exemplifies why a DVD with its video capabilities, has so much more to offer than the same product with only an audio (CD). This recording would be great simply to listen to, but the video simply enhances the pleasure of viewing this wonderful recording. Highly recommended!* Mr. Shaham plays the Countess Polignac Strad, built in 1699. It has, in my opinion, the finest sounding G and D strings I've ever heard on any Strad. (but then maybe it's the way Mr Shaham plays them)

This is a universal satellite radio antenna (universal in the sense it will work with either Sirius or XM satellite car radios).I had to replace my antenna for my Sirius satellite radio as the cord had cracked and was no longer acquiring a signal. This XM version was the only one available at the store I was at, so I bought it, realizing that the antenna for XM and Sirius (now that they have joined companies), was interchangeable.The antenna fit perfectly into my satellite radio, however, the reception of this antenna was inferior to the reception to my previous Sirius antenna. The 'bars', indicating signal strength, are usually only 1 out of 3 (rarely 2) and the signal, frequently cut out, even in very 'open-sky' areas.Conclusion:The reception was unreliable and sporadic. I would not buy this brand of antenna again.Ray Nicholson
