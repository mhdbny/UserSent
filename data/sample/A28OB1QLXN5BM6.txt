I really enjoyed the first DVD, STARGATE - THE ARK OF TRUTH, but felt it was lacking in two areas: 1. no Jack and 2. the "movie" was no more than a standard two- or three-part episode. Well, in STARGATE - CONTINUUM, Jack is back, in not one, but TWO roles! And the story itself is more than satisfying. It is bigger and better than episode, has all the stops pulled out, and retains all of the great elements we have come to know, expect, and love from Stargate.In STARGATE - CONTINUUM, we find our friends called back from their various exploits around various galaxies to witness the execution of the last of the Ba'al clones, thus the final destruction of the System Lords. But, as always, Ba'al has a trick up his sleeve, and the twists, turns, and fun begin. This movie is classic Stargate at its finest, with timelines changed, history rewritten, and our heroes needing to save the day and put everything right.Richard Dean Anderson is perfect in his reprisal of Jack. I really miss Jack when he isn't there. Anderson's timing, ingenuousness, and droll repartee are archetypal Jack, and just what we wanted. Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge are all together again as SG-1. Cliff Simon out does himself as Ba'al. There are special appearances by Beau Bridges, the beloved Don S. Davis, William Devane, and pretty much anyone who has played a character over the last 10 years. It was wonderful to see them all together again, bringing the story full circle and putting a nice, neat, exciting bow on the entire package.STARGATE - CONTINUUM is fast-paced, action-packed and tons of fun. The special effects are terrific, and definitely a cut above a typical episode (which are pretty good to begin with). The settings and scenery are beautiful to watch, and are mostly shot on location. You will find yourself cheering for our heroes, and wondering how they are going to get out of this mess and save the world, as always. But, as always, they do. And we wouldn't have it any other way.

I am going to say up front that I really enjoyed this movie. I was delighted and entertained. Prince Caspian follows The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as the second installment of the classic Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis. It is a strong sequel: the pacing is terrific, the plot moves quickly along, and the visuals are absolutely exquisite, both location and CGI. All of the performances and characterizations are top notch. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy ARE the characters in my head from the books. Aslan IS Aslan; I couldn't ask for anything more. The introduction of Reepicheep, the valiant and loyal mouse, is wonderful. He leaps perfectly from the book to the screen, as real and alive as I have always imagined him. Trumpkin, Prince Caspian, the Badger, Nickabrick, the Trees (oh, those amazing Trees!!!!!), Miraz, the Doctor, etc., are all that I expected, and in many cases, more.Now, here is where it loses the star: this movie is much more of a departure from the book than The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe was. I can't help it, I lived in Narnia for many years. I still visit at least once a year. I have the chapters, the dialog, the entire series memorized. As I watched this movie, the book was playing in parallel inside my head, so, to me, the changes and omissions were obvious. Most of them were merely annoying, but two things really bugged me.1. The love interest between Caspian and Susan does not exist in the book. So why the need to turn this into a teen romance? I agree with Edmund, I don't want to understand it.2. The constant sparring between Peter and Caspian is totally unnecessary, and it adds nothing, IMHO. In the books, Peter clearly tells Caspian that he has come to put him on his throne, not to take it. He is a very supportive friend. So why the "my crown is bigger than yours" tension? I found it ridiculous and distracting.Again, all the salient points from the book made it to the screen, and overall, I was charmed and enchanted by this movie. Disney is doing a splendid job translating these classics to film. I hope they do all seven. The Narnian in me just wants them to stay closer to the stories that C. S. Lewis wrote. However, that does not prevent me from highly recommending this film.

It has been many, many years since I watched Disney's PINOCCHIO. Today, my husband, 3 year old daughter, and I sat down to watch the 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition, and we couldn't have been more delighted. The story of PINOCCHIO is timeless, and this anniversary addition could not have been lovelier.PINOCCHIO is the perennial tale of the wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy. To become a real boy, the Blue Fairy tells Pinocchio he must prove himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish. He has lots of bumps and misadventures along the way, but in the end, with the help of his conscious, Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's wish comes true.My wee one was absolutely entranced by PINOCCHIO; her eyes were riveted to the screen. She was completely absorbed in the story. I have to admit, her daddy and I were, too. Disney did an outstanding job on this restoration. The colors are luminous, vivid, and awe-inspiring. The music, well, the music brings a tear to your eye as you remember the words and melodies. Songs include the classic "When You Wish Upon A Star," "I've Got No Strings," "Give A Little Whistle," "Hi-diddle-dee (An Actor's Life For Me)," to name a few. The sound is beautifully remastered, and every note is pure. And Jiminy Cricket's voice will fill your heart.It is interesting to discover after not seeing this movie for over 30 years, that the myth of PINOCCHIO has become greater than the sum of its parts. For example, as we all know, PINOCCHIO's nose grows longer and longer each time he tells a lie. This is perhaps the quintessential lesson of PINOCCHIO. But this event is on small part of one single scene, yet it is everyone's greatest memory of this movie.As another note, all of the voice acting is uncredited in this film, including Mel Blanc and Cliff Edwards, who went on to voice Jiminy Cricket for many, many years.I am so glad it I was able to share this movie with my child. It was a wonderful, lazy family afternoon. PINOCCHIO is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

As with all the Little Einsteins DVDs, this one contains two previously seen episodes, along with an "all new" episode not yet aired at the time of release. Disney has followed this format on all of the Little Einsteins DVDs so it was not a surpise for us. Perhaps, eventually, there WILL be an all new, full length movie, but that is not what Disney is releasing at this time.My 3 year old daughter LOVES Little Einsteins, as do I. Each episode includes a piece of classical music, a piece of art, and a lesson. The characters are large and bright; and there is always dancing, singing, and a specific musical instrument. In general, ALL the Little Einsteins episodes are well done. They capture and keep my daughter's attention, and she walks around the house humming classical tunes. We purchase all the DVDs so that we can "view on demand," rather than waiting for the right time.The DVD is what it is, and is no more or less than I expected. We have enjoyed watching this together. I recommend it for any Little Einsteins fan.

HORTON HATCHES THE EGG, by the legendary Dr. Seuss, is my 3 1/2 year old's favorite Seuss book. She loves to pretend that she is the Mayzie bird - but a better Mayzie bird, who hatches her own eggs. Ever since we first read this story, she keeps a basket of Easter eggs nearby that she sits and sits on, trying to be a good bird and hatch.In HORTON HATCHES THE EGG, Mayzie is too bored and too lazy to hatch her own egg. She convinces Horton, an elephant who is faithful 100 percent, to egg-sit for just a short while. But, Mayzie is gone for nearly a year, and our faithful Horton sits on that egg come rain, shine, snow, hunters, kidnapping, and the ridicule of his friends. And in the end, he is justly rewarded for his hard work and faithfulness.Only Theodor Geisel can tell a story like Dr. Seuss. Kids and adults alike are drawn to his weird and whimsical characters, and his wonderful, meaningful messages. His tales are all told in rhyme and are pleasing to the ear and the tongue - perfect for reading aloud.HORTON HATCHES THE EGG is a lesser known work of Dr. Seuss, but my daughter and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. It is a great lesson about faithfulness, trust, and doing a job well. And a whole lot of fun, too!

I really cannot say enough good things about WHITE CHRISTMAS. A true classic, a film for the ages, a movie for generations to come, timeless, beloved.Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera Allen...that says it all. Four of the greats, all together in this fantastic film. The songs are memorable and you know the lyrics to all of them. I always sing along to the entire film, much to the chagrin of my children. The dancing is top-notch, the acting is impecable, the story is funny, sentimental, and classic.This has been one of my favorites since I was a child, and in my house, it isn't Christmas until we have watched this movie. Quite simply, IMHO, WHITE CHRISTMAS is the greatest Christmas movie of all time. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Actually, by quite a lot. GET SMART, the movie remake of the 1960s hit comedy series of the same name, is in no way true to the spirit of Maxwell Smart. The original series was cute, warm, and wacky; a patriotic slap-stick comedy. The modern day movie, GET SMART, isn't even a parody of the TV series; rather, it is a very pale and hollow interpretation of an American institution.Neither my husband nor I found the movie version of GET SMART to be funny. There were maybe two spots where we actually laughed (and hence, two stars instead of one); however, most of the time, we never even smiled. Where the original was clever and quirky, the movie is banal and pedestrian, relying on too many insipid off color or fat jokes instead of real humor. Where the first Agent 99 truly cared about Agent 86, from the first time she met him, this Agent 99 can't stand Max and he has to fight to win her approval. Where the original Max was bumbling and lovable, this Max is clumsy, off-putting, and very dull.There are times when a "stupid movie" can be really fun. In this case, the stupid movie, GET SMART, is just plain stupid. There is almost nothing to recommend GET SMART. Especially since the villain is clearly telegraphed from the beginning. We definitely will not be watching this movie again. What a disappointment. It could have been a movie worth watching.

My husband got me into film noir, exposing me to classics such as Double Indemnity, Laura, The Blue Dahlia, Pickup on South Street, and many others. But neither of us had ever seen 1974's CHINATOWN. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Roman Polanski. We expected a lot. We were disappointed.The first problem is the soundtrack. It's all wrong for this type of movie. It's too saccharine and "period." It would be perfect for an old elevator, but not for an old-style detective drama. The story is fine, but Jake, Nicholson's character, figures it out about halfway into the show. His performance is acceptable but he seems to lose steam midway through. Dunaway is pretty bad. It's clear that she and Nicholson are supposed to remind us of Mary Astor and Humphrey Bogart in the Maltese Falcon. Epic Fail. And because it's a Roman Polanski film, there's a dash of incestuous rape thrown in for shock value. I wasn't shocked. I was bored. Then it ended (badly) and I was happy again!Overall, CHINATOWN dragged and the performances were very subdued. Despite Nicholson's gravitas, I can't recommend this "classic." I fully recommend those I mentioned above, though. And if you want a new take on film noir that is truly worthy of the genre, take a look at L.A. Confidential. Note the MPAA Rating for EVERYTHING but it is one of our favorites of the category.NOTE: They only go to CHINATOWN once in this film, and the audience wouldn't even know that it WAS CHINATOWN if the actors had not kept saying it. It could have been any city anywhere. So what was the point?

I have been trying to watch MEET THE ROBINSONS for nearly a year now. Each time I sat down to watch it, my three year old needed mommy for something else. Finally, she, herself, is old enough to enjoy it, so we all sat down together to watch this Disney film. What fun we had!Disney did a nice job with MEET THE ROBINSONS. This film is beautifully animated, had a nice, happy story, and puts a smile on the of each member of the family. With the added bonus of a little cartoon sci-fi and some time-travel, MEET THE ROBINSONS will appeal to almost everyone.In MEET THE ROBINSONS, Lewis is a geeky little 12 year old inventor, who was left at the 6th Street Orphanage soon after his birth. A very sweet, but very quirky boy, Lewis has never found quite the right family to adopt him. Lewis's world suddenly gets turned upside down when mysterious people begin popping into his life. One kid, Wilber, has a time machine and takes Lewis back to the future to fix a very big mess. There, Lewis meets the wacky Robinson family. They would seem to be the perfect family for young Lewis, but of course, there is a catch. Madness and mayhem ensue, and, of course, there is that pesky disturbance in the space-time contimuum to worry about. Lewis must work hard to save the day, overcoming self doubt and evil henchmen. In the end, he gains a loving home and family, which is all he ever wanted.MEET THE ROBINSONS is a very cute, very charming, very off beat family film. It teaches wonderful messages: Don't be so afraid to fail that you never try, failing is good as long as you do your best, just keep trying until you get it right. All are excellent messages for children of all ages in today's fear of failure world.The animation is MEET THE ROBINSONS is nice looking with great vivid colors and fun images. The world of the future is perfect...straight out of the imagination of a 12 year old boy of the early 1960s...bubble transportation, sentient robots, singing frogs...great, great fun.MEET THE ROBINSONS is the perfect family movie for a nice, entertaining evening at home. Curl up together and enjoy. Don't forget the popcorn. RECOMMENDED.

Disney's classic fairy tale SLEEPING BEAUTY is timeless. It is as lovely today as it was in 1959. Full of warmth, saturated colors, and an enduring story, SLEEPING BEUATY continues to enchant princesses of all ages.We purchased this DVD for my three year old as a Christmas gift, but could not resist a sneak peak at Grandma and PawPaw's house over Thanksgiving. The animation was stellar in 1959, and I must say, it certainly holds its own against any animation of today. The vibrancy, detail, and charm still capture the imagination, submerging the viewer the fairy tale world. The story itself is eternal: good triumphs over evil and love, true love, concurs all. The music is a perfect accompaniment to the tale, and "Once Upon A Dream" ranks up there as one of the all time best Disney songs.I very much enjoyed watching this with my two girls and the rest of my family. It was a beautiful way for the entire family to spend a small part of Thanksgiving week doing something memorable together. I was surprised about how much of this movie I did not remember from when I saw it 40 years ago, and I was surprised how much detail my 11 year old remembered from the first time she saw it. The three year old was simply enchanted by the entire movie; from the fairies to Princess Aurora. She was enraptured the magic and the majesty of the story.I highly recommend this dvd as a treat for the entire family. Little ones, teens, parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles will all have a wonderful time together. It will make your time together a little happier and a little brighter. And that is what memories are all about.

THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT, by Beatrix Potter, has enchanted both children and adults for generations. An exciting adventure book for the wee ones, THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT is the story of Peter, who is very naughty. Peter disobeys his mother, and goes to Mr. McGregor's garden, where he gets into all manner of trouble. While Peter does eventually make it home, he is wet, sick, and has lost his clothes (his second set of clothes in a fortnight!), and his mother gives him chamomile tea for supper. His sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who are good little bunnies, get bread and milk and blackberries for supper.THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT gently teaches children to mind their mothers - good little children are given rewards, naughty children get into trouble. This simple tale engages and captivates youngsters who can easily relate to Peter's mischievousness. And while that lesson and Ms. Potter's story are both timeless, it is Ms. Potter's charming illustrations that are the true star of this book. Peter is drawn to look like a real rabbit; a rabbit that wears a very dapper jacket and a little pair of shoes. The soft colors and rich detail of the original drawings continue to delight children throughout the ages.My three year old adores hearing this story. Whenever we read it together, she loves to shout "Stop thief!" with Mr. McGregor and to sneeze "Kertyschoo!" with Peter. She clearly gets great fun and joy out of this classic tale, as do I. All of Beatrix Potter's tales are delightful to share; however, THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT holds a special place in our hearts.

Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND certainly have NOT lost their muchness. In fact, they are full of it! I have to admit, I went into ALICE IN WONDERLAND expecting the worst. I had heard some terrible things from friends who had already seen it, and the trailers didn't give me much hope, either. But since I frequently believe in six impossible things before breakfast, I decided to try ALICE IN WONDERLAND for myself. And I am so glad that I did. ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an incredible mash up of Lewis Carroll's two Alice books - "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There."Let's face it. Tim Burton is a very odd director, and the original Alice books are quite odd themselves. Put the two together and you get amazing brilliance. Remember, Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland is not very true to the source material; rather it is, well, a Disneyfied version of a small part of Lewis Carroll's original works. Carroll accomplished quite a feat with the Alice books: he wrote a fanciful story that really appealed to children, and combined it with a strong satire very relevant to the political world of the time. And perhaps the most astonishing thing of all is that his works continue to be so well known. Many, many words and phrases from the Alice stories have become part of our lexicon and are still in use, even today.But, back to this film rendition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND. This ALICE IN WONDERLAND opens with Alice, age 19, about to get engaged. She doesn't really want to, but it is what is expected of her. We realized that Alice is an unusual girl: she has a mind of her own, modern ideas, and she has been plagued by mysterious dreams all her life. Alice is dreading her engagement (she doesn't even particularly like the young man), when suddenly she is distracted by a rabbit...in a waistcoat, no less! Of course, she follows him, avoids her own proposal, and falls down a rabbit hole. Once she lands, a long, long way down, there are many of the expected Alice experiences from the original book, ending with Alice eventually being the right size to enter Wonderland. Once she is there, people keep asking if she is THE Alice, the REAL Alice, and Alice slowly begins to understand that her dreams...her nightmares...have perhaps, maybe, been memories. But is she the real Alice? Is she the champion? And can she save Wonderland from the Red Queen?Tim Burton works his usual brand of extraordinary magic bringing Wonderland to life. The sets and effects in ALICE IN WONDERLAND are outstanding - dark, colorful, and wonderfully weird. The bandersnach, the jubjub bird, and the jabberwock look very similar to the original illustrations and exactly as I have pictured them in my head all these years. Dee and Dum are definitely Tweedly. And the beamish vorpal sword does indeed go snicker-snack on the Frabjous day. The Rev. Dodgson would have been amazed and proud at seeing his imagination brought to life so vividly. The acting and voice talent are incredible, including the incomparable Johnny Depp as the appropriately mad Hatter, Stephen Fry as the voice of a delicious Cheshire cat, Severus Snape, uh, I mean Alan Rickman as the voice of the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar, Mia Wasikowska as a near perfect Alice, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway as ideal opposite foils portraying the Red and White Queens respectively, Christopher Lee as the terrible Jabberwock, and a veritable host of others. The cast assembled for ALICE IN WONDERLAND is what makes this film click, and all put in amazing performances.I can certainly see that ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not for everyone. It is a very odd and strange film, but, in my humble opinion, in a good way. And in a way that is true to Lewis Carroll's original writings. If you like the bizarre and unusual, if you think you CAN believe in six impossible things before breakfast, then this ALICE IN WONDERLAND is definitely for you. My husband and I really loved it, when we had not expected to. It really surprised us. And that is what defines ALICE IN WONDERLAND as a truly great film.

I always approach animated kid's fare with an odd combination trepidation and hopeful desire. Too often, what should be an amusing tidbit for children turns out to be a flaccid vehicle for a "star" (I'm thinking Bee Movie) or an inexcusable political commentary (like Wall-E or Happy Feet.) But happily, I was completely delighted with CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS.The list of voice actors for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is impressive, reading like a list of SNL alums and more. My favorite, OF COURSE, was Mister T, whose character sported an inverse Mohawk. But the voice actors had a lot to work with here. The script for CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is creative and clever, as are many of the sight-gags. The animation and the 3-D are both respectable and the 3-D is not abused (or necessary, really.) Visually, what struck me even more than the food falling from the sky was the colors. I know that sounds odd, but even the Columbia logo at the start was exceptionally rich. And once the food machine kicks in, that richness is spread across the town.The writers really did a great job of turning a cute little kids book into a cute little movie. The only thing keeping me form awarding it 5 stars is that it does quite rise to the level of Cars or Up. Even so, this is a movie I will undoubtedly see many times. In fact, my four and a half year old is so enamored of this movie, that we have already had repeated viewings. CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS is her new favorite, and I have to admit, I am not yet minding the repeat performances.

How do I describe THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX? On the one hand, it's got top-notch animation, wonderful voice acting, and interesting characters. On the other hand, it has a few too many characters, grown-up themes, and requires the viewer's rapt attention. On the gripping hand, it's just not for little ones. To be clear, it's fine for young ones to watch, it just seems that they are not the film's intended audience. This is odd since it LOOKS like it's a kid's show. It was advertised as a kid's show. But my 4-year-old only watched when Despereaux himself was on the screen, and my 11-year-old spent most of the movie telling me how different it was from the book. My husband and I liked it, but we all agreed it was simply "OK."THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX is actually a couple of tales, starting with the story of a sea-faring rat named Roscuro who loves soup. Through a horrible twist of fate, Roscuro's presence results in the queen's death (death by soup, believe it or not) and the banning of soup and rats from the kingdom. I had to wonder why no one had thought to banish the rats before but eh. Roscuro ends up in the dungeon where only the rats hang out. The second story is about Despereaux the mouse. We decided that Despereaux must be Flemish for "Dumbo" since that's pretty much who this mouse looks like. He can even fly with his giant ears. Despereaux is literally fearless and as such is banished from mousedom for fear of the other meeses learning his bad traits. Guess where he's banished to. That's right, the rat dungeon. Another story is about a peasant girl who dreams of being a princess. Apparently, this was toned way down from the novel, in that the girl's owner only sneers at her and doesn't beat her in the movie. We see how she is sold to the king's cook along with a herd of pigs. She eventually teaches us a lesson about jealousy. Then there's the king's story. He's so sad at the loss of the queen that he bans soup and rats (as we've covered) and sits in his room all day plucking a mandolin. His sadness manifests itself as gray clouds and no rain - everything dies. Then there's the princess who wishes she could fix everything, the jailer who wishes he could undo a tragic mistake, a cook who wishes he could once more make soups, an evil rat who doesn't seem terribly evil, and, and, and... As I said, there's a whole lot going on.The short answer is that THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX itself is not offensive, but there are better options in this genre. Take a look atDragon Hunters, for instance. It deals with the same themes as Despereaux (honor, courage, valor) but my family liked it a lot more.

A few evenings ago, I had the great pleasure of introducing my four year old daughter to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE. Let me tell you, SNOW WHITE is still a true classic - beautiful, charming, and quite amazing even all these years later. And the joy of sharing it with my wee one made it even more special.I don't think that I have seen SNOW WHITE in probably close to 40 years. While I remember the basic story - who doesn't? - there are many snippets and scenes that I had forgotten. Watching this latest, lovely version with my daughter snuggled in my lap, the forgotten scenes and songs came flooding back, and my daughter and I found ourselves singing along together. The music of SNOW WHITE clearly crosses the generations with ease. Old favorites, such "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and "Heigh Ho," sail across the years and are as fun and memorable as ever. My little princess was entranced by this film, and, I have to admit, so was I.It is astonishing to realize that SNOW WHITE was released in 1937, and that it was Disney's first full length animated feature film. The story, the art, the animation, and the music have all stood the test of time, and still rank near the top with the best of the Disney films. This latest version is bright and sharp; quite simply, it is exquisite.Everyone born after 1937 was basically raised on SNOW WHITE. I am so glad that Disney has rereleased it for yet another generation. I can just picture great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters all sitting down together to watch this movie, introducing it to the latest little princess in the family. And that, most certainly, is the true definition of a classic family film.

The Biscuit Brothers, who hail from Austin, Texas, are a kid-oriented, family-style country band, whose goal is to bring music to children every where. "Dustin" and "Buford," along with their "sister," "Buttermilk," strive to teach young and old alike about music and to be educational without being boring. Based on how much both my 3 year old and I both enjoy The Biscuit Brothers, I think they are extremely successful.On their first CD, BISCUIT BROTHERS: MEET THE BISCUITS!, The Biscuit Brothers introduce their unique brand of music and fun using old family standards, such as Bingo, You Are My Sunshine, Old MacDonald, Mary Had A Little Lamb, and This Old Man, as well as some original toe tapping, finger snapping songs. A special favorite of my wee one's is the farm version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as sung by the Cow, the Chicken, the Sheep, and the Pig. Hearing the Cow sing "Moo, moo, moo, mooooooo," (think da-da-da-dum), with the Chicken squawking in counter-point, gets me every time!The vocal stylings of the Biscuit Brothers are accompanied by guitar, fiddle, harmonica, and base. The tunes are simple and easy to pick up. Mom even finds the songs very easy to harmonize. The words are memorable and quickly learned, making this a great sing-a-long album for the whole family. This is another family CD that we love listening to in the car. We just drive down the road, bopping along, having a great time.

A Kiss for Little Bear is a charming story about a young bear who draws a picture for is grandmother. Not surprisingly at all, this picture looks like one of the monsters from "Were the Wild Things Are." Little Bear has his friend Hen deliver the picture to Grandmother Bear. She is so delighted with the drawing that she sends Hen back to Little Bear with a kiss for him. The simple kiss gets passed on, friend to friend ("telephone style") until it finally gets to Little Bear. Little Bear ask Hen to take a kiss back to Grandmother Bear. But Hen refuses because "kisses get all mixed up." In the end, the girl and boy skunk get married, because they enjoyed the kissing. It is all very sweet and innocent.My copy is 40 years old. I remember my mother reading this to me. It was then passed to my aunt to read to her children. When I was pregnant, my aunt gave it back to me. I love reading this enchanting story to my daughter. We giggle and trade kisses and have a great snuggle right before bed. This is another memory filled classic that I am truly thrilled to be able to pass on. Highly recommended.

Ravenous zombies - what more could you ask for on Halloween? RESIDENT EVIL is chock full of monsters, blood, gore, and actually cool, creative decapitations. Based on a popular computer game (which I have never played), RESIDENT EVIL is an entertaining monster flick for a cozy evening at home.RESIDENT EVIL opens with a bang: something has gone seriously wrong in a secret, underground research facility. (Isn't that always the case?) Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility. The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory. A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened. But things go horribly wrong...As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun. It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath. The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers. The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun. The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL. My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween. But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming? I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen. It was in the cards. Eventually, the Red Queen was obviously going to say "Off with their heads!"

Set in London in the early 1970s, THE BANK JOB is based on real life events. A group of would be criminals is set up by MI5 (or 6, no one can keep them straight) to rob a bank and regain compromising photos of a royal personage. Unfortunately for our gang, not only were the photos in question (which were the "property" of corrupt revolutionary Michael X) kept in a safe deposit box at this bank, but so were the secrets and lies of many famous and infamous people, including the payola ledgers of a porn kingpin and the photo files of a well-placed local madam. Everybody who was anybody, from the cops on the beat up to the Lords of the Realm, was implicated in some scandal by the evidence from this notorious bank robbery.THE BANK JOB is a fun, exciting, tension-filled romp. These amateur crooks catch more breaks and have more close calls than you would imagine possible. While the film does slightly bog down on occasion, for the most part the pacing builds just the right amount of suspense with these twists and turns of fate. In several places, my heart was actually racing. By the end, our villains are the heroes, and everyone gets what they truly deserve.I really liked the cinematography of this film. THE BANK JOB actually looks like it was filmed in the 1970s. At one point, I double-checked with my husband to confirm that it was a recent movie. The effect used is very convincing, producing a very authentic look. The ensemble cast was quite good, performing as a cohesive unit, but no individual really standing out.THE BANK JOB is a great movie for an entertaining evening at home. My husband and I really had a lot of fun. And we got to learn a little history from the 1970s as well.

And an unexpected feel-good film. Juno is not your typical teenage pregnancy story. It is, instead, a realistic, yet surprisingly entertaining look at an extremely difficult year in the life of a young pregnant girl. With a loving and caring family, good friends, and the baby's father, Juno attempts to take back control of her life and her circumstances, and to make life altering decisions in her own unique and quirky way.Ellen Page is a phenomenal young actress who plays the title role of June with realism, warmth, intelligence and a wisecracking wit. Juno wants to do what is best for her baby, for her family, for her friends, and for herself. Ellen Page expertly runs the gamut of Juno's emotions and hormones, slowly drawing us in and making us a part of this girl's life and her predicament. We laugh, we cry, we hope, we care.The rest of the cast is equally talented and up to the challenge. Michael Cera as the child's father and Juno's best friend, J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's shocked but supportive parents, and Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the desperate, prospective adoptive parents all give excellent, believable performances.Juno sneaks up on you. It is a quiet film that subtly gets under your skin. I highly recommend this film for a sweet, touching evening at home.

This fourth intallment of Shrek, SHREK FOREVER AFTER, is, IMHO, the best of the Shrek films. The fun is back (minus the juvenile potty humor that invaded the 2nd and 3rd films), the story is delightful, and the message is clear. My kids (13 1/2 and 5 1/2) both loved this movie, as did my husband and I.SHREK FOREVER AFTER is based losely on the story from "It's A Wonderful Life." Here, we find that our favorite ogre is confused by his new role in the kingdom. He used to live a solitary life, scaring people and doing whatever he felt like doing; now he has a family, responsibilities, and is viewed as a folk hero. In a fit of frustration, Shrek wishes that he could be a regular ogre and live his former life, just for a day. Rumplestiltskin overhears his wish and tricks Shrek into trading his "ogre day" for the day he was born. Shrek finds that he never rescued Fiona, he never had a family, never met his friends, and that he will diappear at the end of his ogre day. But there is a way out of his contract with Rumplestiltskin. Can true love still conquer all and save the day?SHREK FOREVER AFTER is cute, fun, and charming family entertainment. The animation is beautiful, vibrant, and vivid, the story is engaging, and all our favorite voice actors are back. The message of being happy with what you have is perfect, and is understood by children of all ages.SHREK FOREVER AFTER has heart, and should not be missed. If this is the final installment, then SHREK FOREVER AFTER is truly the perfect way to end the franchise.

I had never heard of THE HIDDEN. When my husband put it on last night, I thought "What is this, a cheesy shoot`em up cop flick? A `B' horror movie?" But I have to admit, I quickly changed my tune. THE HIDDEN is all of those things, and much, much more. In fact, I really enjoyed this movie.In THE HIDDEN, law abiding citizens are suddenly going on wild, violent killing sprees and then turning up dead. There is a pattern to these outbreaks; they started up north in Washington, have made their way through Oregon, and are now happening in LA. An LA cop and an FBI agent team up to catch the latest killer and put an end to all the bloodshed. But, there is something else going on here, something more than meets the eye. Something is very, very wrong, and it must be stopped. Immediately.THE HIDDEN is bloody, violent, with innumerable chase scenes. It has a campy, well-worn plot. The special effects, well, they aren't, not even for the `80s. And the hair...you gotta love the hair. But THE HIDDEN is very entertaining and just plain fun. The twist at the end is suspected, but plays out a bit differently than originally thought.THE HIDDEN is a hidden gem. If you like cop thrillers, B-movies, sci-fi, or enjoyable, light evenings at home, try THE HIDDEN.

THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK is one of Beatrix Potter's lesser known tales, but it is still a favorite in our house. Jemima is a duck who wishes to hatch her own eggs. Apparently it is common on farms for hens to sit on duck eggs. Ducks in general, and Miss Jemima in particular, do not have the patience to sit on a nest for 28 days, so farmers transfer the eggs to hens. Jemima, however, is quite determined to hatch her own brood, and searches for a calm, quiet place to do so. In a secluded clearing, she meets an elegantly dressed gentleman with a long bushy tail, who is reading a newspaper. Jemima thinks he is mighty civil and handsome, and he is very solicitous of her plight. Jemima takes the sandy colored gentleman up on his offer of a safe, dry place to hatch her eggs. But there is more to this gentleman than meets the eye. Is he really as selfless as he seems?THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK quietly and deftly teaches children to be wary of strangers. This simple tale completely captures the imagination of young ones as they follow Jemima on her misadventures. As always, it is Ms. Potter's charming illustrations that are the true star of this book. Jemima looks like a real duck, albeit one who is wearing a bonnet and cape. The soft colors and rich detail of the original drawings continue to delight children of all ages.My three year old has a special affinity to THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK. Whenever the story refers to Jemima's sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebecca Puddle-duck, my wee one says, "That's me, Momma!" Any book that captures the imagination of my little puddle-duck is a winner with me.

What was the Washington Post thinking? THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE, by Steve Amick, was a Washington Post Best Book of the Year, for 2005, I believe. As I have stated in other reviews, when I read a book (or watch a movie), I want to be entertained, to learn something, or to have cause to think. THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE does none of these things.THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE does not tell a story, per se. Instead, it is the chronicles of the city of Weneshkeen and surrounding environs during the summer tourist season of 2001. The individual threads of this book, of which there are far too many, just start at the beginning of Summer and end at Fall. There is no resolution or completion for any of the threads. At the end, I was left hanging, saying "What?"There are 6 basic streams of consciousness in THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE: 1. the summer sexual escapades of a 16 year old boy and his danger-seeking, over-sexed, screwed-up girlfriend; 2. the Native American, Vietnam vet and his private war with jet skiers; 3. the retired minister and his descent into internet porn and pedophilia; 4. the local cherry farmer and his bigotry toward the spouses chosen by his children; 5. the young, burned-out internet whiz kid, and his search for his next for fortune; 6. the home-town deputy and the jerk of new sheriff from the big city. An over abundance of complicated caricatures, none of whom I connected with or cared about. Mainly, I was just plain bored, but I was also frequently disturbed. THE LAKE, THE RIVER, AND THE OTHER LAKE seems to have been written for shock value, rather than for entertainment. I struggled to finish this book, hoping that there would be a payoff. But that payoff never came.I must say, however, that Steve Amick is very talented and has a very pleasant writing style - easy, comfortable, and engaging. Because of this obvious talent, I wanted to be drawn into this book. Unfortunately, the lack of distinct story and choice of topics prevented that from happening. I was left wanting that part of my life back...the same feeling I had after viewing NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Perhaps his next choice of subject will be an improvement.

First of all, let me say it right up front: the special effects in film are dreadful. Campy. That aside, I really had a lot of fun watching this take on the classic Ray Bradbury short story, "A Sound of Thunder." The basic premise of the story, and of this film, is that ANY change in history, no matter how insignificant it seems, can have serious consequences on the future.Overall, this time travel, adventure, disaster story is actually a light, entertaining piece. People die, some horribly, but you and the cast both know that as soon as the timeline is fixed, everyone will survive. The draw here is seeing how they will do it. Because, of course, if they fix the timeline, history will repeat itself, since no one will remember what happened...or will they? Can they get a message through?The acting throughout is good, with Ben Kingsley as a standout protraying the sleazy, campy owner of "Time Safari, Inc". This is quite a departure from his normal performances, and thus enjoyable to watch.I definitely recommend "A Sound of Thunder". It is worth buying on dvd for a fun evening at home.

In Bruges was just not my cup of tea. To be fair, I will say right up front that my husband loved it. However, this movie did not appeal to me in the least.First of all, this film is in NO WAY a comedy, not even a dark comedy. It is a very dark drama that has some admittedly funny moments. But advertising it as a comedy misleads the audience.In Bruges details the odd morality and sense of right and wrong held by a group of hit men. When one of the group accidentally kills a small child, the boss sends him and his partner to the lovely, historical city of Bruges for a two week cooling off. The movie centers around the two hit men on vacation, and how they spend their time while waiting to hear from their boss. When the bossed finally makes contact, you get the ending you expect from the beginning.My issues with In Bruges stem from the gratuitous, horrific violence of this film. Yes, yes, it is about hit men, but I do not ever need to see a child being shot in the head. It was completely unnecessary, and the information could have been conveyed in a number of different ways. Clearly the director was going for shock value. The movie was also full of drugs, stupid racist comments, and plenty of f-bombs. While bad language does not normally offend me, I do prefer that it not be every other word. Again, shock value.Overall, the acting in this film was very well done. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson both do an excellent job in their roles, and are thoroughly believable. Their friendship is actually quite touching. Bruges itself is charming - a lovely backdrop for a film.In Bruges has been compared to Pulp Fiction. However, I did not care for that film, either. I want to be entertained when I watch movie, and I do feel this film could have been extremely entraining. There IS a good story here. It is just not carried out well, IMHO.

Based on the reviews here and elsewhere, it seems that I am nearly alone in disliking this film. To give you a context for my remarks, know that I love movies, almost without regard to genre. A good movie stands on its own merits. I liked Batman Begins quite a lot, and I loved Iron Man.What really knocks the wind out of THE DARK KNIGHT is that at 2 hours, it's about 1 hours too long. It's serious all the time but not in a gripping, edge-of-your-seat way. I loved the Operation Skyhook scene and only one other that I can't now recall. The rest was plodding and predictable. Yes, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was inspired, but I think he was on-screen way too much.As always, Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain are wonderful, and I like Gary Oldman, although he's only around briefly. Aaron Eckhart is good as Harvey Dent, but his turn as Two Face was short and confusing. Maggie Gyllenhaal was just blah, and Christian Bale was just there.Maybe I've been spoiled by the wonderfulness that is Iron Man, but THE DARK KNIGHT kept me looking at my watch.

Let's face it, this movie is not high art or high comedy. What AN AMERICAN CAROL is is a response to all of the America bashing that has come out of Hollywood and the news media in the past 35 years. People are fed up with being portrayed as uneducated, red-neck warmongers and are fighting back.The message of AN AMERICAN CAROL is that America is not perfect, but we do the best that we can, and in most cases, our motives are pure. We are stepping up to the plate to help the world when no one else is willing to do anything.AN AMERICAN CAROL has an all-star cast, and is written by the David Zucker who also gave us the AIRPLANE and THE NAKED GUN movies. It is a very interesting, long over due commentary on our times, and well worth a look.

My 4 year old daughter's new teacher read THE KISSING HAND to the class on the first day of school, and she was very taken with the story. She seemed to make an immediate connection with it. She talked about it so much, that I ordered a copy for home. And we have read this story almost every night since it arrived.THE KISSING HAND is the story of a young raccoon named Chester. Chester does not want to go to school; he wants to stay home with his mother. But his mother shows him a special family secret - THE KISSING HAND. THE KISSING HAND let's Chester know that his mother's love is with him always, no matter where he is.THE KISSING HAND is a perfect story for any child facing a new situation on their own. All any child wants to know is that they are loved, totally, completely, and always. It is that unconditional love that gives children confidence to face new situations with self-assurance and independence.The prose is clear and simple; the illustrations are lovely, detailed, and colorful. THE KISSING HAND is a charming, endearing story that will touch a chord with any young child and quickly become a family favorite. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Everyone knows the story of Cinderella; her story is perhaps the most well-loved princess story of all time. At three years old, my young daughter is enamored of all things princess, and Cinderella is clearly the most beloved princess of all. We recently were lucky enough to take a fabulous Disney cruise. When my daughter actually got to meet Cinderella, to hug her and to talk to her, she was quite literally quivering. I truly thought she might faint from the excitement. It was her dream come true.Disney's classic masterpiece brings Cinderella's story to life, in full, rich, beautiful color, with familiar, catchy, adored songs, and gorgeous, detailed, vivid animation. This tale is endearing to princesses of all ages, young and old alike. We watch Disney's CINDERELLA several times a week in our house, and every time, my daughter watches straight through from beginning to end, completely enchanted. Heck, I am still completely enchanted, even after all these years. It is lovely, charming, sweet, and happy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all princesses everywhere.

I am really surprised that HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON did not do better in the theatres. My husband, 13 and 5 year old daughters, and I selected this movie for family movie night a few weeks ago, and we all liked it very much. HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is a sweet, adorable movie, beautifully rendered, with a kind-hearted messages.DreamWorks really did a nice job with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON. In HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, we meet Hiccup, the son of a Viking chief. Hiccup is, well, different that the other Viking kids; he is skinny, smart, and not particularly interesting in killing things. Unfortunately, their village is constantly under attack by dragons, and all children must learn to become dragon hunters. Hiccup does try to kill dragons, but he always fails, often times making things worse for his village. Finally, through a stroke of pure luck, Hiccup manages to bring down a dreaded Night Fury dragon; but, of course, no one sees it happen. Not even his father believes his story. Tenderhearted Hiccup cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, who he names Toothless. Instead the two bond and form a fast friendship, Hiccup learns how to tame dragons without killing them, and in the end, saves his village and his people from an even worse threat.The plot of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is story we have all heard before, countless times, but, quite frankly, we didn't care at all. The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are quite talented, and the tale is very charmingly told. My 5 year old loved it (and wants repeated viewings), the 13 year old declared it okay (which at this age is EXTREMELY high praise), and my husband and I enjoyed ourselves. The messages are clear and kid appropriate: 1. Don't do things just because they've always been done that way. 2. Think for yourself. 3. Get to know your enemy. If you can't remember why you are fighting, it might be time to stop.HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON is good family entertainment, perfect for a quiet evening at home. My kids now want pet dragons. Hmm... I wonder if I can fit 2 dragons in the backyard...

Those evil, all powerful corporations just never learn. Rule #1: never, never go back into the secret, underground research facility after it has been sealed off because of cannibalistic zombies, rampant viruses, and a crazed, out of control, killer computer. But in RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the big, bad Umbrella Corporation does just that. And baaaaad things are released into Raccoon City. Very bad things. And it looks like only Alice can stop them.As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining. The pace is fast, the plot is thin, but followable (and even contains a few surprises), and the acting is typical for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting. The special effects are decent, if corny at times.If you take this flick for what it is, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a fun, modern day B-movie, perfect for a popcorn evening at home. My husband and I had as surprisingly good time with this. And we are actually looking forward to seeing the next one!

THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is a very fun, extremely charming YA fantasy novel by versatile author Betty Dravis. TOONIES is based on the original premise that if humans are sad enough and in need of sympathy, then the cartoon characters on your computer screen can talk to you, can actually leave your computer, and can join you in the real world. Dravis is clearly a very talented and imaginative storyteller. She not only makes this wild and wacky idea completely believable, she makes it plausible as well. As Dravis weaves her wonderful web of words, you find yourself immediately drawn into the vivid world of the story, caring for her colorful characters and their predicaments, and quickly turning the pages to see how it all turns out.As the parent of two daughters, ages 11 and 3, I would like to commend Ms. Dravis for one important aspect of this YA novel. In almost every story where the kids are the heros, the parents are either dead or they are evil (think Harry Potter or almost any Disney story, both of which I love, btw). However, in TOONIES, the parents are not only alive, they talk to their son, he goes to them for advice, and they have a wonderful family relationship based on love and respect. Yes, the family has its issues and misunderstandings, but they work together to resolve their problems. I am absolutely thrilled to see such positive family behavior and values modeled here. This key element alone would have me singing the praises of Ms. Dravis from the highest mountain tops. The fact that it comes wrapped in a grand adventure is just the icing on the cake.I am going to give this book to my 11 year old to read next. I am certain she will love it. I think you will, too. THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY is highly recommend for children of all ages.

I am a huge fan of Star Trek in any form. Yes, some versions are better than others, but I still believe that any Star Trek is better than no Star Trek at all. That all being said, I really like STAR TREK-GENERATIONS, the sixth Star Trek film. While it is not the best incarnation of Star Trek, it certainly is not the worst. In fact, it is a good, effective passing of the torch from one, er, generation to the next.I have seen this movie a number of times: the first at the theatre in 1994, and most recently on tv the other night. After all these years, STAR TREK-GENERATIONS is still exciting and entertaining, with familiar, well-loved characters, terrific special effects that hold up today, a decent, emotional plot, and fantastic actors with amazing chemistry. Additionally, the spectacular destruction of the Enterprise Mark D continues to be one of the best crash-landings on film. I can remember cringing and gasping in the theatre the first time I saw it, and it still makes me flinch today.STAR TREK-GENERATIONS successfully transitions the film franchise from The Original Series to The Next Generation. This is a film that had to be made, and it is solidly done. It has the right kind of "Wagon Train to the Stars" feel that Roddenberry initiated all those years ago - full of action, adventure, moral issues, and larger than life characters. This meeting of our two strong, beloved, yet different captains of the Enterprise is memorable and poignant, and that alone makes this film worth seeing. If you are a Star Trek fan, then STAR TREK-GENERATIONS is not to be missed.

This remake of Omega Man (staring Charlton Heston), which itself is a remake of Vincent Price's The Last Man on Earth, is arguably the best of the three.I watched both of the above movies in preparation for viewing I am Legend. Each is campy and fun, updated for its own time. I expected the same from this: another fun zombie movie. I was quite mistaken.Although not a die hard fan of Will Smith, I am in awe of his stellar performance in this movie. It is basically a one man show, and Smith hands-down proves he has the talent and screen presence to successfully pull it off. It is a riveting performance; one in which Smith lives up to his potential as a cinematic leading man. His emotions are realistic and run the gauntlet: anger, humor, hope, love, caring, despair, shock, loneliness, fear. He does it all and leaves you believing.The cinematography of a deserted New York is outstanding, both oddly beautiful and action packed. The opening sequences grab you and glue you to your seat. The scenes of Smith hunting on the streets of NYC really drive home just how alone he is.The infected, the CGI vampires, actually made my skin crawl. All the effects were well done, and allowed the viewer to successfully suspend his disbelief.Overall, this is a great film. It still affected me days after I had seen it. And that is exactly what a good movie should do.

The movie musical Hairspray is a wild romp that leaves you with a song on your lips, tapping toes on your feet, and a big, HUGE smile in your heart. I just wanted to sing and dance along throughout the entire film. (And, to the consternation and mortification of my children, I DID!!!)The cast commits 250% to their roles, and all have a full out good time, which carries right on through to the audience. Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, James Marsden, and Elijah Kelly are all triple threats in this wonderful, feel good film. The dancing, singing, and acting are all excellent.The heart and soul of this perky film are the simply outstanding production numbers. The clever choreography is fun and peppy, and the highly enjoyable songs are finger-snapping good (you end up humming them for days). The pacing is perfect from beginning to end; you are immediately hooked, and they just reel you right in.Overall, this is a happy movie where the girl gets the boy, and everybody sings. A good, old fashioned musical. You will be singing and dancing in no time. What fun!

Knocked Up is billed as a light romantic comedy. However, it is neither romantic, nor funny. This movie is unrealistic, juvenile, and dreadful beyond words.There is absolutely no chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, or their characters, Alison and Ben. The entire premise is completely unbelievable. There is absolutely nothing in this marginal plot to indicate that Alison has any attraction to Ben, or why she ends up sleeping with him. Throughout the movie, the two were completely unbelievable as a couple.The "comedy," if it can be called that, is infantile, crude, and at about the middle school level. Maybe boys of that age might find it funny, if the subject matter and the language were not so completely inappropriate. Middle school girls, and ANYONE over the age of about 17, would just find it disgusting.I absolutely cannot recommend this film to anyone.

"A Boy and His Dog" (1975) is science-fiction satire based on a well-known Harlan Ellison story. The movie takes us on the adventures of a young scavenger, Vic, (a VERY young Don Johnson) and his intelligent, telepathic dog, Blood, in post-apocalyptic Arizona. Blood and Vic need each other to survive, to find food for both and the girls for Vic. Blood is always hungry, and Vic always wants a woman. That's the common through-line of the entire movie, and it drives Vic to do things he might not normally do. Or might he? This low tech, well-paced film is dark and funny, making it deserving of its cult status.

My husband and I spent a cozy evening at home last night, enjoying OCTOBER SKY. Based on the book Rocket Boys (BTW look at the two titles...OCTOBER SKY is an anagram of Rocket Boys), OCTOBER SKY is the story of a group of kids, growing up in a dying coal-mining town. The launch of Sputnik captures their imagination, and gives them all impetus to learn about rockets and make something more of their lives. With the help of a beloved teacher, the boys achieve their dreams and accomplish things never thought possible.While this story is old and familiar, OCTOBER SKY is sweet, comfortable, and very well done, keeping us interested in these characters and their lives throughout the film. You cheer for these kids, hope for their success, and are proud of their achievements. Sentimental and inspiring, OCTOBER SKY is perfect family fare. The acting is well done, the photography is lovely and wonderfully atmospheric, and the story right on target. If I have any criticism at all, it is that this film drags a bit in a few places. But, overall, OCTOBER SKY is a wonderful feel good movie.OCTOBER SKY reminds us all to go for our dreams, because you might just achieve them. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I watched TOY STORY 2 last month while on our Disney cruise, and I cannot believe that I have never seen this movie before. What a cute story! I really enjoyed it, and my 4 year old daughter was enchanted - Jesse has instantly made it to her sacred list of favorite Disney characters.Disney does many things right, but their stories with the messages of being true to yourself and true to your real friends are always outstanding. These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many ways. And TOY STORY 2 is clearly one of the best renditions.With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim. The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.After the lights came up in the theatre, my wee one and I discovered that her 12 year old sister and her dad were also in the audience. Which is just further proof that Disney is the premier maker of wonderful family entertainment. TOY STORY 2 is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Let's set our Way-Back Machines to 1968. A young director named George Romero has just released a new, low-budget zombie flick called Night of the Living Dead. Although I never did get into that one, I loved the 1978 sequel Dawn of the Dead which I renamed Zombie Mall. Since then, I've seen several zombie flicks, and while very few have risen to the level of Dawn of the Dead, there are stand-outs including Resident Evil, Shaun of the Dead, and South Park's "Pinkeye" episode. ZOMBIELAND is not on that short list.To be fair, ZOMBIELAND is worth seeing if you don't mind a good amount of unspecified gore. It's a high-budget take on a low-budget flick. The acting is serviceable with Woody Harrelson being the best of the bunch. But there's really nothing new here. There are a couple of laughs, including a cameo by Bill Murray and a quest to find Twinkies, but this is mostly ground that has been covered, and much of it was covered in 1978.Even so, ZOMBIELAND is the perfect movie for beer and pizza night. No need to pause it during bathroom breaks.

My newly four year old daughter had a mermaid themed birthday party this year. As one of her gifts, she received Disney's special addition of the LITTLE MERMAID SOUNDTRACK. She loves the music from this movie, and I have to admit, I do, too. This CD was a huge hit at her party.With this version of the LITTLE MERMAID SOUNDTRACK, you receive two discs. The first is the original soundtrack from the LITTLE MERMAID. This CD contains the entire score with all of those wonderful, memorable, toe-tapping songs. The second CD contains remakes of some of the same songs by some of Disney's current, popular teen artists. Now, while this disc may not be my thing, the four-year olds at my daughter's party loved it. They don't know, and they don't care, who is singing, but the updated, upbeat versions of the songs were perfect for an impromptu dance party. On the spur of the moment, we put 40 air filled balloons on the floor of the family room, cranked up the volume on disc 2, and had a fantastic time watching 13 4-year olds rock out. It was hysterical. The kids had great fun, and the adults laughed so hard, they cried. It was the best party ever, and completely unplanned.This version of LITTLE MERMAID SOUNDTRACK is a must for any Disney collection. You will love it, your kids will love it, and you can make some wonderful dance memories. RECOMMENDED.

I am a true, hardcore Heinlein fan. I have read everything he ever wrote, and have enjoyed it all. Starship Troopers is classic sci-fi at its best; a fast paced, suspenseful, all out space opera, published in 1959 for young teenaged boys. This hard science fiction adventure story stands the test of time and is still an exciting read for boys and girls of all ages.Taken at face value, this story is about a recruit who joins the Mobile Infantry, endures the toughest boot camp on the planet, and then goes into battle against the toughest enemy ever to face mankind. Any kid to today will love this story; it will grab their attention and capture their imagination with interstellar spaceships, cool weapons, weird aliens and plenty of action.But as always, Heinlein writes on many levels. Give this book to an adult, and he/she will enjoy it for the same reasons, but find a completely different meaning. Heinlein had a unique, and quite possibly correct, philosophy when came to military service. He did not believe that everyone should be required to serve nor did believe in a draft. In Starship Troopers, Heinlein makes it clear that not only should service be completely voluntary, but only those truly qualified to serve should have the honor of doing so. And what makes a person qualified, aside from intelligence, bravery, and ability? Heinlein's central qualification was that the PRIVILEGE of military service should be limited to those who clearly demonstrated that the health and welfare of their society is more important to them than their own personal health and welfare. The needs of the many...In this novel, it is extremely hard to join the military, but it is very easy to walk away AT ANY TIME. No one is forced to do something that they do not wish to do. Hence a military career commands the respect and honor it deserves. You would think that in the United States of America, the defense of one's home/country/planet SHOULD command the highest respect, the highest pay, the highest honor. Yet, military service is looked down on, disrespected everywhere, and smart, patriotic people do their best to avoid it. In many cases, the wrong people are defending this country for the wrong reasons. (Please, PLEASE understand, I am speaking in GROSS EXAGGERATION here to make a point; there are many, many fine and honorable soldiers out there to whom I give my greatest appreciation and support.) But we as a country ignore these fine men, do not respect them, and treat them poorly upon discharge. Heinlein recognized this situation in 1959, and I am sad to say that it is worse today. As a country, we need to change.I was asked recently if I thought that Heinlein glorified war in this novel. My answer is no, I do not. After rereading this novel, it is clear to me that Heinlein hated war, but realized the necessity of it. And if it IS necessary, then he only wanted the best of the best to defend us. I agree.

Question: What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?Answer: CORALINECORALINE is a deliciously creepy odyssey which starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!When first we see CORALINE(not Caroline, as she has to remind folks), she's bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.The story is nicely edited, keeping the reader turning pages and wanting to know what happens next. In fact, once I finished the book, I went looking for the movie. Unfortunately, it has already left theaters and not yet made it to store shelves. I'll just have to keep my button-eyes peeled for it!

I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans: my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!). All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards. All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name. The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power. The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes. If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees. While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie. This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron. These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way. These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey. Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the "dream scene" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be). Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric. The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness. The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die. And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do: whets our appetites for the final installments I know I can't wait until July. The final movie promises to be the best yet.Side note: As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film. He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies. It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.

HALF MAGIC is a fresh, charming YA story about 4 children who find a magic coin that grants wishes. The problem is, it only grants half of what you wish for, so you need to wish for twice of what you want. Now sometimes wishing for twice of what you want is easy, and sometimes it gets you into a whole lot more than twice the trouble.HALF MAGIC, by Edward Eager, is pleasantly written in a delightful, amiable fashion, perfect for all ages. Somehow, the tone, the style, the atmosphere, the language all make this book feel a little bit like the classic THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, by C. S. Lewis. The four children discovering their magic and then learning how to use it, the adults not believing in it, and even the magic not working for them any more after they had learned what the cosmos felt they needed to learn, all reminded me of the tale Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. But they are very different stories, each with its own merits.My 11 year old daughter received this as a gift and really enjoyed it. She learned a bit about fractions, too, which is always a plus. I highly recommend this book. It is sweet, fun, and full of surprises.

Sam Raimi is back! The director who gave us Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness returns to the comic horror genre after a 17 year hiatus. And his latest masterpiece, DRAG ME TO HELL, is destined to be another cult classic.DRAG ME TO HELL is the simple story of Christine Brown. Christine seems to have it all: a boy friend who loves her and the inside track for promotion at work. But to secure her promotion, she is forced to make a tough decision and evict an elderly gypsy woman from her house. The gypsy woman puts an evil curse Christine, and now she has only three days undo the curse before she is dragged into Hell for all eternity.As with his previous comic horror films, Sam Raimi successfully combines the jump-out-of-your-seat-BOO-factor with a corny story and cheesy special effects. DRAG ME TO HELL is fun, especially when you realize what you are most afraid of is a lady's lace handkerchief! Completely tongue-in-check, DRAG ME TO HELL will keep your heart racing and the laughter flying, both at the same time.One of the nice things about DRAG ME TO HELL is that it is rated PG-13: there is no gore, no real blood (oh, there is some, but it is so clearly over the top and fake), no real violence, and I am not sure there is even any bad language. There is an ick factor, but the rest is all up to the viewer's imagination, and as always, Sam Raimi helps us put our imaginations to good use. If you like fun-filled, silly horror films, or if you have never seen a Sam Raimi film, DRAG ME TO HELL is an excellent choice.

There is just something about that Pigeon! THE PIGEON HAS FEELINGS, TOO! is another installment in the Pigeon series by Mo Willems. A board book geared toward toddlers, THE PIGEON HAS FEELINGS, TOO! is part of the "A Smidgeon of Pigeon" subset of the Pigeon books which allows very young children to share in the enjoyment of the adventures and antics of Pigeon.Don't get me wrong, though, this book is still classic Pigeon. In THE PIGEON HAS FEELINGS, TOO! the characteristic line drawings, simple and colorful, introduce toddlers to the concept of feelings, expressed in typical Pigeon fashion. Pigeon stomps when he is angry, mopes when he is sad, and dances when he is happy. The pictures elicit grins and giggles as this short story unfolds. The Pigeon is a unique and distinctive character, and his voice is perfect for young children to relate to. He pouts, he shouts, he gets very stubborn. Even the youngest readers/listeners know he sounds just like they do. He speaks directly to them, too, which just adds to the fun.THE PIGEON HAS FEELINGS, TOO! is a great addition to any Pigeon collection. Cute, silly, and fun, your kids will have a great time with this book.

SAVING GRACE, starring Holly Hunter and Leon Rippy, quite simply takes my breath away. This show is an unfiltered look at the life of police detective Grace Hanadarko (Hunter) who works in the Oklahoma City major crimes division. Grace feels responsible for the death of her sister in the Oklahoma City bombing, and she is well down the path of total self destruction, taking all of her guilt, anger, and frustration out on herself. While Grace excels at her job, is compassionate with victims and their families, is devoted to her nephew and her dog (Gus), and is a dedicated friend, she is also a hard-hitting, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, booze-swilling, bed-hopping mess. Grace is almost beyond redemption.Almost beyond redemption, but not quite. Into her life comes Earl. Earl was quite literally sent to Grace by God. He is her "last chance angel." Wings and all. It is Earl's job to help Grace redeem herself, and help her stop her tail-spin into Hell. And so the sparring begins. Let me make it clear that this is not a show about religion. It is not. SAVING GRACE is about faith, forgiveness, and healing.Holly Hunter is brilliant in this role. She is gutsy, raw, honest, and in your face. She never pulls a single punch. She is not always likeable, but she is always real, believable, and passionate. Leon Rippy as Earl, a good ole boy who just happens to be one of God's handymen, is warm, friendly, and very likeable. Although he is not human, he likes to sample the tamer human pleasures (food, warm showers, shopping, world travel, etc.), and he provides the perfect counterpoint to Hunter's irrepressible Grace.The rest of the cast are all superb (including Laura San Giacomo as the OKC version of CSI and Grace's devoted pal since childhood); a fantastic ensemble that rounds out the show and completes the total package. The interactions, the timing, the humor, and the emotions are all dead on. The camaraderie of this cast come shining through; they clearly enjoy what they are doing. The writing and the dialogue are tight and terrific. This is a superior show, week after week.Please be advised that this IS a very adult show. Language, nudity, sex, uncomfortable topics; there are no holds barred. But that is part of what makes SAVING GRACE the out of the ballpark hit that it is.

My husband, 11 year old daughter, and I watched TIME BANDITS the other evening. My husband remembered it from his college days as being extremely funny, and thought we would all enjoy it. The whole family loves British comedy, and we were really looking forward to this. Unfortunately, TIME BANDITS has not held up well over the years. We all sat there a bit glassy-eyed and slack-jawed, waiting for the laughs.For some reason that I cannot quite my finger on, this film just isn't funny anymore (if it ever was). With supposedly Monty Python-esque humor, I would have thought that TIME BANDITS would have become a sort of timeless classic similar to the Monty Python films. But what works for Monty Python, what makes THEM classic, doesn't work or is severely lacking in TIME BANDITS.The plot is old, predictable, disjointed, and, quite frankly, boring. The pace is plodding and tedious. The special effects, while they may possibly have been innovative in 1981, look cheap and cheesy. The acting, from this "all star" cast is mostly dreadful, although John Cleese and Sean Connery both deliver their typical fine performances. The ending is bizarre, and while I understand what the director was going for, fails miserably. And, as others have stated over and over, the quality of the disk transfer is just horrible - dark, jumpy, and full of artifacts.I was temped to give this a two-star rating based solely on the performances John Cleese and Sean Connery, but why bother? You can see both of them in much better films. TIME BANDITS is dated, dumb, and dull. NOT RECOMMENDED.

National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets is a very enjoyable and fun romp, and an excellent follow-up to the original National Treasure. The entire cast has returned: Nicolas Cage as Ben Gates, Diane Kruger as Abigail, Jon Voight as Ben's father, and Justin Bartha as Riley. Added to the cast are Helen Mirren as Ben's mom, who, of course, holds the key to deciphering the map, and Ed Harris as the villain. Or is he? In the end, even he is redeemed.Book of Secrets is both action packed and full of fun. The team is on another treasure hunt, searching for the legendary "city of gold." This film has romance, adventure, wild chases, narrow escapes, unreal situations, and ridiculous coincidences. What it does NOT have is sex, drugs, violence, blood, gore, bad language, or crude humor. Yes, the plot is full of holes, but so what? This movie is entertaining, funny, and perfect for the entire family. Just suspend your disbelief and enjoy it.And yea! There are hints of a third adventure, one commissioned by POTUS. I, for one, cannot wait to see what is on page 47. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long.

UNDERWORLD, a faced-paced, in your face, kick-a** monster movie, tries to answer that age old question. Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries. Very few even remember how the blood feud started. But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden. Or has it?UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up. Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat. The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination. The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances. The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles. And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous: gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits. I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite. Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot. But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope. And this is what the Lycans are looking for.Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD. It makes for a great popcorn evening at home. It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope? Apparently, something the Lycans want and the Vampires don't. And something bigger and badder than both...

THE TERMINATOR has become a classic; an iconic piece of movie history. This is the movie that made the Govenator a star. Part sci-fi time travel drama, part blood and guts shoot `em up, part action-adventure, THE TERMINATOR stands the test of time and remains a favorite in the hearts of its fans.Arnold Schwarzenegger became a household name playing THE TERMINATOR, a killer cyborg from the future whose sole mission is to kill Sarah Connor. His performance as the merciless, unstoppable killer is chilling. This is the first movie in which he wore clothes for the majority of the film, and where he uttered what is arguably his most famous line "I'll be back." (Admittedly, he only had 18 lines!) Linda Hamilton is terrific as Sarah Connor, a young woman who is stronger than she thinks and is able to overcome incalculable odds. The special effects are excellent, especially for 1984, and they still look great today.I just plain like this movie. I remember seeing it in the theatres in 1984, and being blown away. And I still enjoy it after all these years. I showed THE TERMINATOR to my 12 year old daughter a few days ago, and she thought that it was "pretty cool," too. High praise coming from a tween!

I saw CADDYSHACK, oh, at least 200 times during my 4 undergraduate years. I was a "little sister" for the Evan's Scholars Fraternity, a national colligate fraternity for caddies. This newly released 1980's comedy was their anthem. Weekend parties centered around it. And, of course, there was drinking - lots of it. At the time, I thought CADDYSHACK was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.Last night, my husband and I watched CADDYSHACK for the first time in about 25 years. True, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Chevy Chase all turn in outstanding, zany comic performances. There are many scenes that have become classics, and many jokes that still elicit a loud chuckle and the occasional guffaw. But all these years later, the humor struck us both as juvenile and crude, the plot as mindless, and the sex as, well, gratuitous and tasteless.Clearly, CADDYSHACK is a cult flick that has not aged well for the general audience. I don't think I will be watching this one again anytime soon. I prefer my memories of it from my college years, and not from last night's viewing.

SHUTTER ISLAND, the Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is one picture I really wanted to like but didn't. I just couldn't. SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous "Dachau Massacre." You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND. There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:- Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest- 1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential- Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None- I See Dead People: Sixth Sense- Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From AlcatrazFor a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.

There is no question that Robert Anson Heinlein is one of the Fathers of Science Fiction. There is also no question that STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is his most famous work, having been called "the most famous science fiction novel ever written." Is it his best? Perhaps not. But it is a ground breaking classic, one that I enjoy reading again and again.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the story of Valentine Michael Smith (Mike), a male born of human parents on the first Earth colony ship to Mars. Literally born as the ship landed on Mars, Mike's parents and the rest of the crew died, and Mike was raised by Martians. 25 years later, a second Earth colony ship lands on Mars, and discovers Mike, the native inhabitants of Mars, and a host of unanswered questions. Mike returns to Earth, and STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND is the detailed chronicle of his introduction to, interaction with, and transformation of human culture.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was Heinlein's first truly adult science fiction novel, and he took on some pretty heady topics. Politics, religion, sex, equality, and the concept of a truly un-human culture (which happened to be superior), to name a few. Heinlein wove these themes into STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, each of which contributed to his idealistic vision of a perfect world.He intermixed shock value, logic, and plain good storytelling to get his points across, and I think he did so quite wonderfully.1. Religion. Heinlein was not an atheist, as some have claimed. He did believe in a higher power; what he did not have any use for was organized religion. He believed in faith. If you had faith, true faith, then the trappings of religion were unnecessary and superfluous. They just did not matter. The Church of All Worlds in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND was set up to show that no matter what the religious trapping were, it was faith that really mattered. He also created a religion where happiness and self-belief were the main drivers, rather than fire, brimstone, and fear. Makes great sense to me.2. Sex. Contrary to popular belief, STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND did not promote promiscuity or free love. What Heinlein did was to create a world where people were open about sex, where it was enjoyable and exciting, but with it came great responsibility. In this world, sex wasn't hidden, secret, or naughty; rather it was honest and pure and fun. People who could develop this utopian attitude became happier, healthier, less jealous, more caring, and, yes, more sexual. Responsibility to partners, offspring, and an entire extended family became the norm. In his own way, by exploring sexuality, Heinlein was exploring and redefining the meaning of family. He was also trying to define sex as a miraculous union, and to show that humans should treat it as the miracle of bonding and "growing closer" that it is.3. Equality. Before the sexual revolution and equality for women, Heinlein clearly believed in equality of the sexes, equality of the races, equality of faiths...basically the equality of all humans. Yes, he felt women should be treated with respect and reverence and be protected and nurtured because they gave birth and perpetuated the species, but he clearly believed that they were intelligent and capable. He also believed that women had sexual needs equal to those of men and had the right to pursue those needs.4. Politics. In STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, Heinlein clearly had little use for government, politics, or politicians. He believed that government in general was a necessary evil, but preferred that it be kept small and out of his business. He didn't care what it was based on or what guided it - astrology was the ridiculous example used in STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - as long as it left him alone. Works for me. He also had little use for entitlements, and expected human beings to work for what they received. Again, works for me.5. Un-Human, Superior Culture. Heinlein did a remarkable and revolutionary thing when he created the Martian culture of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. The Martians of this novel are clearly not humanoids from another planet. They do not think like humans, act like humans, look like humans, reproduce like human, live like humans, or do anything like we do here on the planet Earth. There is nothing remotely recognizable about these Martians; they are completely alien. We can't them, and they can't understand us. They are older, more advanced, and can perceive the universe around them in ways that humans do not. But humans can, if properly taught, learn some of the things that Martians do. What a marvelous concept.In 1962 the original version of STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND won the Hugo Award for the Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year. After Heinlein's death in 1988, his wife Virginia discovered the original uncut manuscript and arranged to have it published in 1991. It is interesting to read the two books side by side, to see the differences, and to compare them. I enjoy both versions very much, and am still not sure which is my favorite. Whatever version you choose, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. Whether you have read it before or not, whether you love it or not, you will find it to be an interesting and thought-provoking read.

OrNo Country For Old Super-HeroesTHE WATCHMEN is another movie based on a comic book - er, GRAPHIC NOVEL. First picked up in 1986 by 20th Century Fox, the project bounced around the world from the US to the UK to Czechoslovakia, resting briefly at just about every major studio in the world. There were multiple scripts drafted, multiple directors tapped, and a Who's-Who of Hollywood talent courted for the lead roles. In the end, we got exactly what you'd expect to get: a mess.Think of THE WATCHMEN as The Incredibles, only a lot less entertaining. This is a live-action story of the last of the super-heroes. At the start of the film, we are treated to a wonderful montage that tells us "the story so far." I'm not exaggerating when I say we're treated to it. It's the best part of the film. They should have stopped right there, but they didn't. And I hear that the DVD has 20 minutes MORE for us to suffer through. That comes to 182 minutes of watch-watching pain. I digress.THE WATCHMEN is set in 1985. Richard Nixon is somehow in his third term, the Soviet Union is about to nuke us, and a giant blue super-hero named Doctor Manhattan straddles the world. Naked. (He's naturally blue, too.) Doctor Manhattan is omnipotent which makes him boring. His pal is called Ozymandias, after the Percy Shelley poem. He's all-knowing which makes him petulant and boring. Then there's Doctor Manhattan's love interest, her mom, her former love interest (pretty but boring, boring in bad make-up, could be interesting but is as boring as day-old toast) and the Comedian, an absolutely unlikeable guy who rapes, murders, and laughs about it all. I wish he had been boring, but he was just disturbing.The only interesting character in THE WATCHMEN is Rorschach. His face is an ever-shifting Rorschach ink pattern, which is really cool but odd since he is the only one who doesn't waver in his ideals and commitment. He's a hard-boiled detective who has completely lost sight of the "the line." He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line. Rorschach is really the driving force of the flick. His scenes are interesting, understandable, and move the plodding plot along. Even so, some of his scenes are gruesome and unnecessary for the character or the story.Honestly, I get disgusted remembering THE WATCHMEN, not because of the needless gore but because of the wasted effort. The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is classic, but the acting is dreadful and the story is deadly dull with a wholly unsatisfying ending. Yes, I admit it; I sat through the whole thing. I was just HOPING something good would happen. And it did! THE WATCHMEN finally ended.

Corduroy is very charming story about an adorable teddy bear who lives in a department store. No one wants him because he is missing a button from his overalls. After a night time adventure in the department store, a young girl named Lisa comes to buy Corduroy with her very own money and to take him home as her very own bear. Lisa refuses a bag for Corduroy, and lovingly carries him home. Even though Lisa loves him just the way he is, she sews a new button on his overalls to make him more comfortable. Corduroy realizes that at last he has a home and a friend; the two things he has always wanted most.This warm and heartfelt story teaches children the all important life lessons of unconditional love and a true home. Every child wants and NEEDS to be loved for who and what they are, no matter what mischief the get into. While everyone else ignored Corduroy simply because he was missing a button, to Lisa he was the perfect bear to take home and love completely.Apparently, Corduroy is classic that has been around for many years. While I missed this story during my childhood, I more than thrilled to share it with my 3 year old. Corduroy is well loved in our house, and he will be in yours, too.

The Name of the Rose, based on the novel by Umberto Eco, is a dark historical drama set during The Inquisition. Full of suspenseful atmosphere and medieval hardship, this moody film brings to life the brutality of the time. The feel, cinematography, dialogue, and soundtrack all provide the audience a unique view of the Middle Ages. A murder has happened among the monks, and William of Baskerville called on to solve the mystery. William and his young novice make an excellent investigative team for this world of the Inquisition and it's suppression of knowledge.This rather quiet, quirky little film features the talents of Sean Connery as William, a very young Christian Slater as the novice, and F. Murray Abraham as Bernardo Gui. Additionally, there are a number of recognizable character actors in the supporting cast. The murder mystery whodunit plot develops at a slow, leisurely pace, continually building the intrigue through to the end.Overall, The Name of the Rose is absorbing film which I found surprisingly interesting. I recommend it for fans of Sean Connery, Medieval history, murder mysteries, or period drama. It is just the thing for a quiet yet unusual evening at home.

I remember when Steven Speilberg's "E.T. The Extra Terrestrial" was first released, being touched and awed by such a beautiful and unique film. Everyone I knew was talking about this film; it struck an emotional cord in young and old alike. It, along with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", was one of the first films with aliens where the aliens were NOT portrayed as invading monsters, and we, the people of Earth, didn't immediately shoot first and ask questions later. Even in the classic "The Day the Earth Stood Still", a soldier shoots at Klatu in one of the earliest scenes.This story of a boy named Elliot who develops a deep and lasting friendship with a young space alien accidentally left behind on Earth teaches lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot and his new friend ET show us the power of wonder, innocence, acceptance, curiosity, and communication. The scene where Elliot begins to attempt to teach ET to talk via a stream of consciousness naming of everything in sight is wonderful, so typically childlike and real. It always brings a huge smile to my face.I watched ET again last night with my newly 3-year old daughter. I was amazed. It immediately captured her attention; she watched it with huge, wide, interested eyes. As she sat in my lap, she whispered various questions - "What's happening, Mommy?" or "Why are the kids screaming?" I explained that a young ET had been accidentally left on Earth by his mommy and daddy, that Elliot was searching for ET to bring him back to his house, that the little girl and ET were scared of each other at first, etc. She took it all in, absorbed it, and clearly thought about it. When Elliot brought food for ET, and when Drew Barrymore started smiling at ET, my daughter exclaimed, "Oh look, Mama, now they are friends!" with a happy, satisfied smile on her face. Near the end she said, "He misses his mommy. ET phoned home." Her sweet, insightful, innocent comments once again brought tears to my eyes.This film continues to be pure magic. "E.T." has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves the highest praise and more. Introducing it to a young child improves even the best experience, bringing to mind memories of that first time and surpassing them. It truly is a film for the ages, for all generations, and will be for years to come.

After my preschooler started learning to read with the Bob Books, I wanted to mix in some different material to help her apply what she was learning to other books. HOP ON POP, by the legendary Dr. Seuss, was the perfect choice. HOP ON POP uses rhyming words and short, active sentences to help children extend their reading vocabulary and build up their sight words.The brilliance of HOP ON POP stems from using rhyming words to teach common diphthongs and letter combinations, and then adding or changing only one or two initial letters to form new words. From these new words, Dr. Seuss then creates the wild and zany sentences he is famous for, and are easy for very young children to read. As a possible example, using "at" as the basic letter pair, you can form the words cat, hat, sat, and bat. The silly sentence then might be "The cat in the hat sat on a bat," accompanied by a wacky and wonderful Sessian illustration showing the cat in the hat sitting on the end of a baseball bat. At 72 pages, HOP ON POP has many basic letter patterns that really help a young one build their reading skills fast.My wee one loves to read HOP ON POP to me. She can do it all by herself, with very little prompting, and her pride and confidence in her new skills are through the roof because of HOP ON POP. HOP ON POP has really helped to increase her sight word vocabulary, as well as her ease and comfort in sounding out new words. HOP ON POP really is a perfect first reader.

RETURN TO ME is soft, sweet romantic comedy staring David Duchovny and Minnie Driver. This film, although very predictable, is charming and quite well done. My sweetie and I spent a very pleasant Sunday afternoon relaxing together and enjoying this film.In RETURN TO ME, Bob Rueland (David Duchovny) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joely Richardson), are very much in love. They seem to have the perfect life. Then tragedy strikes and Elizabeth is killed in a horrible car accident. Bob is devastated; he is barely functioning. After about a year, he meets Grace (Minnie Driver), and he feels an immediate connection to her. Grace has her own secrets, however. She has recently had a heart transplant, and for the first time in her life is not "the sick one." She doesn't want to tell Bob about her transplant. As things progress, Grace realizes that she must tell Bob about her medical past. Unfortunately, it is almost too late, and Grace and Bob may both end up with broken hearts.RETURN TO ME is wonderfully sentimental, very engaging, and very sweet, without being too syrupy. I cried in the beginning, I cried at the end, and I smiled the entire way through. It is just a plain nice movie. Minnie Driver gives her typical excellent performance, and David Duchovny (who, as much as I love him, just can't act) does a fine job. Bonnie Hunt, as both a first time director and as Grace's best friend, uses her signature humor and dry wit to great advantage, and Jim Belushi is great as her lovable oaf of a husband. As wonderful as the entire cast is, however, Carroll O'Connor, as Grace's grandfather, and Robert Loggia, as his partner in an Irish-Italian restaurant, steal the show, bringing tears and laughter to your heart each time they are on the screen. Wonderful old standards permeate this soundtrack, and you will find yourself quietly humming along.RETURN TO ME is pure delight from beginning to end. Enjoy it with someone you love. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I was never a fan of horror movies, but my husband has convinced me to watch a few, and I've really come to like certain ones. I now add LEGION to that special list. LEGION is a different kind of horror flick. Not much horror, not much gore, plenty of action, and a surprising amount of goodness and light. The general plot is that God has lost hope in mankind and has sent a plague of angels to wipe it out. But one of his archangels turns against him and comes to Earth to protect humanity. Archangel Michael still truly loves mankind, and will lay down his live to save us all. Despite this description, LEGION is not irreverent and not overly religious. But, I am not going to dwell on this aspect of LEGION, because the movie doesn't dwell on it.I knew nothing about LEGION before we started, but as I watched it, it sure felt like a Stephen King novel: a group of strangers, stranded at an isolated diner, must fight off hordes of evil. And even though it is NOT based on a King novel, I was just as completely absorbed by LEGION's story.I took a look at what the critics on Rotten Tomatoes had to say about LEGION, and they hated it. Loathed might be a better word. And I think most of the comments are justified, although some are just snobby. Is this a perfect movie? No. Are there clich&eacute;s and genre cross-overs? Yes. Did I enjoy watching it? ABSOLUTELY. LEGION is definitely one of those films where the whole is much more than the sum of its parts.

AWAY WE GO isn't a great movie but it is certainly entertaining. The story revolves around a thirty-something couple who are about to have their first child. When things don't go as planned, they decide to pull stakes and look for a new home. In its own way, AWAY WE GO reminded me of the Little Prince, who went from planet to planet, meeting strange new people. This couple's search unearths the odd, kind, bizarre, tragic, and confused, who unknowingly show the couple how normal they really are.There are moments in AWAY WE GO that are very funny, and a few that are sad or touching. Most of the dialog is above average. All of the actors are credible and competent. Maya Rudolph, of SNL fame, is actually very good. The only other feature I've seen her in was Idiocracy, where she seemed to be playing a character more suited to Saturday Night Live. Here, she shows that she can play real characters instead of just caricatures.The overall pacing of AWAY WE GO is a little slow, but it is still worth watching. I'd be reluctant to watch it twice, but I would if I had to. Three times is probably out of the question. RECOMMENDED.

I'll just say it - TWILIGHT is a dreadful movie. I'm not giving anything away by telling you it's about teen vampires. But these vampires all stepped out of Abercrombie and Fitch commercials. Apart from that - and the part about drinking blood - they are just brooding, boring, angst-ridden teenagers. If you want a not-meant-to-be-scary vampire movie, Lost Boys is way better. But, of course, Lost Boys didn't have inter-species teen love. (Question: if one of the teens is really hundreds of years old, is it still teen love?) Even that part - which is supposed to send little girls swooning - is just boring. That part of the show goes on the list with Blue Lagoon and Endless Love. Somewhere near the bottom of that list. I watched TWILIGHT with my tweenaged daughter. She knew the lines and the plot and professed to hate every second of it. Her criticisms were spot on, too. She found it to be boring, silly, and melodramatic. I just sat there wondering why the kid who got killed in Harry Potter wouldn't look at the girl from Zathura. They didn't even seem to like each other, let alone love each other. And some of the vampire lore was really odd, and certainly not traditional. Did you know that if one vampire bites you that another vampire can suck the first vampire's "toxin" out of your body? I sure didn't! That knowledge would have come in handy just last weekend!I could go on but I really don't want to relive this stinker. If you want a better vampire movie, then you have many to choose from. Try the aforementioned Lost Boys, Fright Night, Buffy, or Underworld. For better (yet still icky) teen love movies, try anything starring Brooke Shields.

I really wanted to like SUPER 8, and there are certainly elements to like. But as I sat there with my extended family, including a 6, 7, 10, and 14-year-old, I kept wondering who the audience was. Clearly, it was intended for children, since the mother dies immediately in a horrible crushing accent. (Dead parents are the hallmark of all great kid movies, donchaknow?) And then the jokes about what was in the mother's coffin (seriously), because she was brutally crushed, so there couldn't be a body...well those scenes had my kids in stitches. Then there was the movie-long father-son angst about the mother's brutal death - riveting to say the least - and the pot-smoking hippie who drove the kids around declaring how stoned he was. Plus the language the kids spewed. And the military murdering a teacher and...and...and...What's good about SUPER 8? The child-actors were fine. They were 100% clich&eacute;, but that doesn't bother me. The movie that they make is funny but lasts, literally, as long as it take the credits to roll. There's a clich&eacute;d but sweet coming of age/first romance story that is respectable. The alien angle was too scary for the younger kids in my group, but the concept of the protagonists catching something important on their little camera is compelling. I really do wish it had been more like the Goonies or Stand By Me, to which SUPER 8 has been widely compared.When I see Steven Spielberg's name on the marquee of a science fiction movie, I'm really torn. My impulse is to run, but I remember Minority Report and think, maybe... But I also still remember A.I., and my feet start me moving toward the door. For SUPER 8, I saw J.J. Abram's name, too, and I was hopeful. Alas, it was not to be. I have to think there were some mighty internal fights over the direction this movie should take. And in the end, I think the audience was the loser. I would have loved to see more of the small-town charm, more of the kids (quieter and with more believable dialog) and less of the angst and brutal mother-crushing.

I vividly remember watching HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN on television many times as a young child. It made a great impression on me then, and it still impresses me today. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, multiple generations (including a passel of kids from 4 to 14) watched this classic, 1950s, movie musical together. Everyone was enchanted. Older generations shared their happy memories of this story with the younger ones. And I was shocked and delighted to discover that I remembered the words to every song.As stated in the opening frames of this film, HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is "not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about a spinner of fairy tales." And what a charming fairy tale it is! With outstanding songs by Frank Loesser, a brilliant performance by Danny Kaye, and gorgeous scenery that seems to leap right out of the pages of a fairy tale picture book, HANS CHRISTAN ANDERSEN captures the hearts and souls of old and young alike. The wonderfully familiar and memorable songs get the entire family singing along. I clearly remember the words to "I'm Hans Christian Andersen," "The Ugly Duckling," "Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen," "Thumbelina," "Inchworm," "The Emperor's New Clothes," and "No Two People (Have Ever Been So In Love)" from my childhood. In fact, I have been singing some of these songs to my kids for as long as I can remember!HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is a happy multi-generational family film that will give everyone warm fuzzies. This is the perfect time of year for watching HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, but I would be thrilled to watch it anytime. This beautiful, nostalgic musical brings up many happy memories and helps make new ones. HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I grew up watching the original Disney cartoons, and this DVD brings back wonderful, vivid memories. Based on the classic book by A. A. Milne, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh delightfully brings to life Christopher Robin, The Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh, and all of his friends. Included are the all the timeless favorites: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974). Wow, was it really as late as 1974 that we met Tigger for the first time? I feel like I have know him since I was born!This masterpiece contains some of the most incredible, memorable, and recognizable voice talent of all time, including Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet. Sebastian Cabot narrates, speaking directly to the characters and to us, and tying all the stories together. Pooh and his friends clearly loved Sebastian Cabot just as much as we did.The songs are most firmly fixed in my mind - "Hefalumps and Woozles", "The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers", "I'm Just a Little Back Rain Cloud", and of course "Winnie the Pooh" to name just a few. We hum and sing and dance to each one. The memories are strong here; all the words come pouring back.For the 25th anniversary addition, the animation has been lovingly and vividly restored to its original glory. This DVD is as stunning as I remember the originals to be. As the pages of the book turn, Pooh seems to leap off the page, and into your heart.My young one loves this as much as I do. She requests this DVD frequently, and I am more than thrilled to be able to share it with her. Thank you, Walt, for giving me these beautiful memories to pass on to my daughter.

In preparation for watching this WOLFMAN, a remake of the 1941 classic by the same name, I watched the original starring Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains. I think it is fair to compare the two movies because the new one is so obviously patterned on the original. It's clear that the director was not trying to remake the classic as much as he was trying to refresh it. To some extent, I think he succeeded. While the original had all the earmarks of a B movie, the new one has very high production values, adequate special effects, and top flight actors. But what the original had that the refresh does not is heart. When Lon Chaney Jr. learned what he had become, I believed in his remorse and fear of horrors he was bound to commit. Benicio del Toro does pronounce the same sort of fear, but I never felt it. It was more of a checking off of a box. The same is true of the father's character, although that was intentional and to say more would be a spoiler.As I watched the new WOLFMAN, I kept waffling between liking it and being ambivalent toward it. After letting the experience settle for a few days, I've decided on ambivalence. There was really nothing about it that got me excited or fascinated or touched. So Lon and Claude can rest easy. They haven't been replaced yet. In a perfect world, it would have been wonderful to see what Lon Chaney, Jr. and Claude Rains could have done with today's production values. That would have been magical, I am sure."Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright."

TO HELL AND BACK is arguably the one of the best World War II movies ever made. And what makes this classic film so very special is that it is a true story. The events portrayed in TO HELL AND BACK are real, as they actually happened, without any Hollywood embellishment.After the death of his mother and at the tender age of 16, Audie Murphy, received special permission to enter the Army infantry, after being turned down by the Marines, the Navy, and the paratrooper corp. Young and small for his age, Audie's squad mates felt the need to watch out for him, but soon Audie was taking care of them. His quiet commitment to doing what was right, to doing the best job possible at all times, along with his heroism led to a series of promotions, and finally a battlefield commission. His final mission earned him the Medal of Honor and made him "the most decorated soldier in America." Unfortunately, a leg wound from that final mission also ended his military career, and at the age of 19, after just 27 months of combat action, Audie Murphy was honorable discharged from military service. After the war, Audie Murphy became a B-movie star, making over 30 Hollywood westerns and other films, including TO HELL AND BACK, his own biography.TO HELL AND BACK is straight forward telling of Audie Murphy's life. Simple and honest, TO HELL AND BACK portrays his affection for his comrades, his innate goodness, and his love of family and country. I do not normally care for war movies, but this is one that I would watch again and again. A story of outstanding heroism and bravery, TO HELL AND BACK is not to be missed.

I just finished reading the original RAGGEDY ANN STORIES, by Johnny Gruelle, to my almost 5 year old daughter. When we started, I was not certain that she would enjoy RAGGEDY ANN. Written in 1918, the language is very formal, and the word patterns and sentence structures are strange and out of date. But my wee one loved "Raggely Ann!" She asked for a new story every night, and she has chosen favorite stories to be read again and again.RAGGEDY ANN STORIES is, as you may guess, a collection of stories about the mischievous adventures of a rag doll. Johnny Gruelle wrote the stories for his young daughter, Marcella, who owned that original handmade Raggedy Ann doll and is also featured in each story. In these stories, as soon as Marcella (whom the dolls love very much) leaves the nursery or goes to sleep, all the dolls come to life and get into a lot of monkey business, with Raggedy Ann leading the way. I am sure that is why my little mischief-maker enjoys the RAGGEDY ANN STORIES so much - she really relates to Raggedy and her predicaments.My copy of the RAGGEDY ANN STORIES was published in 1918 and belonged to my grandmother. Her mother read it her, she read it to my mother, my mother read it to me, and now I have the pleasure of sharing it with my little angel. The RAGGEDY ANN STORIES truly transcend time. I will pass this treasure along to my daughter when it is time, and I am sure she will read it to her own children. If you haven't read the RAGGEDY ANN STORIES, you should. You are missing out on a wonderful piece of history.

I really wasn't that interested in watching GONE BABY GONE when my husband turned it on. Very quickly, however, I was drawn into the intense drama on the screen. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, and extremely thought provoking. It is not easy to watch. But it is very much worth seeing.I like my movies to entertain me, teach me something, or make me think. GONE BABY GONE definitely falls into that third category. It is not always easy to define right from wrong, good from bad, black from white. And when the life of a child is involved, the moral areas get grayer and grayer. Is it right to commit a crime, if it will improve the life and happiness of a child? This question is posed in many different ways in this film, and the answer is never clear or easy.Overall, the acting is very good. Headliners Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Ed Harris give realistic, believable, heartfelt performances. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan, Michelle Monaghan, and John Ashton are all very strong and genuine. In some cases, perhaps the performances were almost too realistic; I had some difficulty in a few places understanding the thick, almost mumbled, South Boston accent.First time director Ben Affleck does an outstanding job. He navigates you through the multiple twists, turns, and reverse loops of this detective mystery thriller so well that you never quite see what is coming. The end is disturbing, to say the least, and leaves you thinking hard, trying to decide what is "right." My husband and I are still debating this, and we will be for some time to come. Highly recommended.

What do you get when you strap a camera to a woman's head and just film her days and nights, then edit it all down to 2 hours? Probably something very close to this movie, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.The tag line for HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is: The one movie this fall that will put a smile on your face. But it didn't. I checked. I never smiled or laughed or even chuckled. I grimaced twice and cringed once, but I never smiled.HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is very much a stream of consciousness flick. Even as I type this, I am at a loss to tell you the point of the movie. I know it was about a woman, pretty, 30, a school teacher, never married, who lives with her girlfriend, has a troubled student, meets a crazy guy under a bridge, has issues with her sisters, sleeps with a social worker, and is learning to drive from a crazed conspiracy theorist. But I'm still trying divine what it's about. I did work out that the main character, Poppy, is both happy and luck because, in a bit of clever writing she says, "I am happy. I'm a very lucky lady."There is really nothing at all about HAPPY-GO-LUCKY that stands out. Not the acting, not the story, not the scenery, not the soundtrack, and especially not the writing - nothing. And when it was over, I felt cheated at having sat through it all with the hope that suddenly the disparate elements would congeal around one moment and I would say, "Wow." Sadly, that moment did come but it left me decidedly un-wowed.Now comes the worst part. I saved it for last.As if to confirm my suspicions that I will never ever be invited to be a Member of the Academy, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY was nominated for an Oscar. In addition, it has won awards from all over the world, including a Golden Arena Award at the Pula Film Festival. Yeah. You heard me right. After my review, I'm pretty sure I'll never be invited back to Pula.On the "No Country for Old Men" scale, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY comes in a tick or two higher simply because Poppy never says, "Friend-o."

I had a big grin on my face throughout this entire film. I laughed out loud in many places, and cheered the characters on in others. After 20 years, Indy is back, and so is the fun and excitement.As with every film in the series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starts off at warp speed and never lets up. Like its three predecessors, this very entertaining film is full action, adventure, excitement, thrills, chases, true love and, yes, even camp. Did I know what was going to happen pretty much every step of the way? Of course, but it all happened exactly the way I wanted it to. It was typical Indiana Jones, full of references and homage to the past films, and I did not need it to be anything else.Harrison Ford is once again brilliant in his portrayal of our hero. At 65, he is still handsome, sexy, believable, and true to character. And as always, he gets the girl. Karen Allen is wonderful reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood. She doesn't look like she has aged a bit, and she is absolutely terrific. The chemistry between Indy and Marion is palpable. Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams does quite a remarkable job. His high-speed sword fight through the Amazon is amazing and memorable. I have to say the ants were an inspired choice for this film's requisite creepy-crawly scene. We live in an area swarming with fire ants. I HATE ANTS.As always, John Williams' musical score is rousing and fills you with anticipation. As the music set the perfect stage for all of the film's action, I found my self humming along with the familiar and well loved theme. This is one that I can't get out of my head, and I don't really want to.Set in the 1950s, smack in the middle of McCarthyism, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings the Indiana Jones franchise into a new era. It is jam packed with classic and clich&eacute; 1950s references, from motorcycles and greasers, atomic bombs, Roswell and little green men, and the red menace. Overall, this film isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!). It is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable continuation of a well loved story.And I think it succeeded. As the credits rolled, the audience applauded and cheered. I highly recommend this film for the entire family.

There is no question that in 1989, Disney's animated film, THE LITTLE MERMAID ushered in a new golden era for both Disney and animation. Widely recognized at the time as one of the best Disney films in decades, THE LITTLE MERMAID brought the beauty and joy of Disney animation to a new generation of audiences. THE LITTLE MERMAID went on to become one of the most honored animated films of all time, garnering two Academy Awards, on for Best Music, Original Score and the other forBest Music, Original Song, "Under The Sea."The artistic beauty of THE LITTLE MERMAID shines through in every frame. Artist James Coleman created exquisitely detailed backdrops for this film. The songs of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are classics in their own right: memorable, toe-tapping, and fun...some of the very best in the Disney repertoire. The characters themselves are unforgettable. Ariel, Sebastian, Flounder, Ursula have all ascended to the pantheon of Disney greats.And of course, none of this describes how my 4 year old daughter feels about Ariel and THE LITTLE MERMAID. Ariel's story of the THE LITTLE MERMAID who wanted feet, and her beauty, innocence, and fascination with the human world instantly propelled her into the ranks of the classic Disney princesses - Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White. She is beloved by millions of little girls across generations, and my little one is no exception. She is a strong female character who proves she can take care of herself, along with a little help from her friends. I really like Ariel as a role model.This platinum addition DVD is a must have for any Disney, princess, or animation fans...or for the little princess in all of us. My wee one and I love curling up on the sofa together to watch THE LITTLE MERMAID. We become captivated by the story each time, and we love to sing-a-long. It is a wonderful time together. What else could anyone ask for?

In the Cincinnati area, there is a chain of chilidog restaurants called SKYLINE Chili. In Ohio, and surrounding areas, these restaurants are something of a mecca; people travel for hours for just a taste of SKYLINE Chili. However, my husband, a Texan, can't stand the stuff. He's not sure exactly what's in it (and the Internet tells us that perhaps chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg might be involved), but he knows what chili is supposed to taste like, and SKYLINE ain't it.Similarly, the movie SKYLINE is supposed to be a science fiction thriller. Sadly, it ain't what it's supposed to be, either.Summary of SKYLINE (the movie, not the chili): Insipid people (who do nothing to make you care about them) wake up to see aliens landing in LA, sucking humans into the air, and ripping their brains out to use in alien equipment. That's it. Period. Done.As with the chili, the ingredients in SKYLINE are there for all to see in the final product, but divining them individually is a problem. At first, SKYLINE seems to be like the movie Cloverfield, with its immediacy of events. Then it's like a summer camp horror flick with everyone hiding in the cabin so Jason or Freddie won't get them. Then it's a lot like War of the Worlds, in some places almost exactly like the original version. We also have scenes from Independence Day. Did I mention District 9? How about the Matrix? They're mushed up in there, too.On top of that, I simply couldn't care about the any of the characters in SKYLINE; not even the pregnant one. I kinda cared about the cute little doggie, but I knew he was a gonner the moment I saw him, so I didn't get invested. My husband teared up when the F-22 got whacked, but he was already complaining that it shouldn't have been worrying about ground targets when we didn't have air superiority. He thinks that way. I just wanted it to blow up bad guys. That is what is supposed to happen in movies like this: the military blows up the bad alien monsters, and we all live happily ever after. However, in SKYLINE, there is not a single ounce of happily, and definitely no ever after...Which brings us to the "ending" of SKYLINE. Telling you about the "ending" would be bad form, so I wont't do it. But to put quotes around the word should give you a clue. First, it's bizarre and looks like they swerved from science fiction into comic book. Thinking about it, the "ending" reminded me very much of District 9. Second, it's an ending only by virtue of the fact that the credits stared rolling. It doesn't end anything. In fact, it makes it pretty clear that there's more coming, but let us all hope it's not SKYLINE 2: The Baby.SKYLINE isn't even a good B-movie monster flick. I enjoyed movies like the The Blob, the original Invation of the Body Snatchers, The Day of the Triffids, and Plan 9 from Outerspace infinitely more than SKYLINE. Those are classics, to be enjoyed for the corny camp that they are. SKYLINE feels more like the background to a movie that hasn't started yet. Two hours of introduction that goes absolutely nowhere and generates absolutely no interest.As the credits rolled, my husband harrumphed and said, "The chili is better." Coming from him, that is saying quite a lot.

If your small children are like mine, then they are always fidgeting, squirming, and wiggling. It is simply impossible for them to sit still. If that is the case, then your child will immediately relate to Tiddler, the star of FIDGETY FISH by Ruth Galloway. "Tiddler was always fidgeting;" so much, in fact, that his mother sends him out to work off his excess boisterous energy. "Swim until you are tired," she says. So Tiddler swims out of his cave, and the adventure begins. Tiddler flips and dives and leaps around, meets some interesting critters, gets into and then out of trouble, and ends up back home. All because of his fidgeting.We have the board book version of this enchanting story, and it is very well loved in our house. The illustrations are extremely cute: bright, colorful, and eye catching. The writing style is especially engaging; it doesn't really rhyme, but has almost a chanted rhythm to it that really seems to connect with young children. The words themselves are very vivid and onomatopoetic; when read aloud, they really fire up my child's imagination. Of course, the fact she gets to burp while reading this story just adds more to the fun.Tiddler has become a favorite character in our house, and his story is requested often. I am guessing that he will be with us for a long time. FIDGETY FISH is highly recommended both as a read aloud book and as a book for early readers.

If You Give a Mouse a Cookie is a modern classic, beloved by children everywhere. It is also a book that teaches about sequential action and consequence. For example, if you give a mouse a cookie, he is going to ask for a glass of milk. If you give him a glass of milk, he will probably ask for straw. As the book continues, the drink leads to a napkin, which leads to a mirror (to check for a milk mustache), which leads to a haircut, which leads to cleaning up, etc., and so forth. The tale eventually comes full circle, with thirst leading to a glass of milk, which leads back to giving a mouse a cookie. And of course, if you give a mouse a cookie...My three year old and I love reading this together at bedtime. I start the sentence on each page ("If you give a mouse an xxxx...), and she shouts out the end of the sentence (",...he is going to xxxx."). The result is lots of giggles which are very nice right before bedtime.This fun, entertaining book is beautifully illustrated with rich, detailed, colorful drawings. I highly recommend this book for small children and beginning readers, and I guarantee that it will quickly become a family favorite.

So, just how many super-secret, super-huge, underground, scientific lairs does the evil Umbrella Corporation have?? And will they never learn? Playing with zombies is very dangerous, and could very well mean the end of humanity as we know it.RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is the third installment in the RESIDENT EVIL series of zombie flicks. Picking up approximately 5 years after the end of RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the deadly virus created by the Umbrella Corporation has escaped containment and turned the world into a barren waste land. Humans, dogs, birds, rats, and all other living creatures have been turned into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. The remaining humans who have survived the virus are in a constant battle for their lives, banding together in roving caravans. Our hero Alice wanders the planet on her own, killing zombies wherever and however she can. In answer to a distress call, she rejoins some old friends, and together they make a break for the last known, virus-free outpost. But Alice's powers continue to develop and grow, and the Umbrella Corporation wants her back...at any cost.As with RESIDENT EVIL and RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is a monster-killing, gore-filled zombie flick that is unexpectedly entertaining, and is perfect for an evening of mindless relaxation. I never imaged I could enjoy this series so much. The pace is fast and bloody, the plot is a bit more substantial than the previous two installments, and the acting is standard for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting. And the special effects in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION out do themselves for the title of Best On Screen Decapitation Ever, clearly besting the previous title holder, the original RESIDENT EVIL.RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION is bit of a departure from the modern day B-movie genre of the first two movies. There is a little less camp, and lot more "jump out of the dark and go BOO!" in RESIDENT EVIL - EXTINCTION, taking it more toward the horror genre. Still, my husband and I had a really good time watching this this. The ending is a perfect set up for the next flick, which promises to launch the most formidable zombie destoying army yet. Go ask Alice...

I watched this movie to see what all the fuss was about. It won the Academy award. I hoped and expected to like it. But, I am not sure I even understood it.There are some truly wonderful points about this film. The acting is outstanding. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem all give stellar performances. You love Tommy as the country sheriff; you root for Josh Brolin all the way, and Javier Bardem is an extremely creepy bad guy. There is also a great cast of tremendous supporting actors, who all give marvelous performances. The settings are authentic - there is no question that you are in rural Texas. The cinematography adds to the feeling of desert and desolation.However, the plot is all over the place. It SEEMS to be about the hunt for a psychopathic killer. It SEEMS to be about the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. It SEEMS to be about the life of an old country sheriff in rural Texas.However, based on the odd, unfinished, unsatisfying end of this film, where TLJ is explaining the dreams he had the night before to his wife, the summation of the actual story appears to be "life sucks, and then you die." That's it.I watch a movie for a number of reasons. To be entertained. To be moved or touched. To learn something. No Country for Old Men did none of these things. At the end, I felt...nothing. I have no impressions from it, no real thoughts about it. Just a vague sense of "why?"...I cannot recommend this film to anyone. The emperor truly is naked.

My entire family (husband, daughters ages 13 and 5, and me) all love the Avatar: The Last Airbender series, and we all really, really, really wanted to like THE LAST AIRBENDER. But we were all horribly disappointed. The original animated series had excellent, entertaining stories and very good writing. THE LAST AIRBENDER film is truly awful. It boggles the mind that anyone could take such an exciting, inspiring, hopeful series and turn it into such a drab, dull, boring film. The finer points of the series were completely missed.I have no idea what M. Night Shyamalan was thinking. As the writer, director, and producer of THE LAST AIRBENDER, the film could have been anything he wanted it to be. Apparently, what Mr. Shayamalan wanted it to be was dreadful. The acting was the worst I've seen (they couldn't even manage to pronounce the characters names correctly!), the scenes were dark, lacking in color and interest, the editing was choppy and uneven, and the writing and direction were completely uninspired.The Avatar: The Last Airbender series was entertaining and fun. But M. Night Shyamalan's movie version should be avoided at all costs. I really hope that they do not intend to make the next three movies. I don't think I can stand to be that disappointed again.

LUCIFER'S HAMMER, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, is a thoughtful, thought-provoking end-of-the-world disaster novel. It is billed as a science fiction novel, and, to date, I have always considered it to be science fiction - after all, this thrilling novel intricately describes the days leading up to and following the impact of a comet on the surface of the Earth. However, after further ruminations, I realize that this book is more of an apocalypse, action-suspense novel, which happens to contain hard, factual science. The science here is not the basis of the story, but rather the setting for this inspiring book.In LUCIFER'S HAMMER, a new comet has been discovered. It is big, it will be visible from Earth, and it will be spectacular. There is much excitement about this discovery, but as it comes closer and closer, the chances continue to increase that it will actually hit our planet. Of course, the worst happens, and because the comet has calved (split into many pieces), the Earth is not impacted once, but multiple times. Monstrous tidal waves, immeasurable earthquakes, extremely flooding, uncountable hurricanes, violent volcanoes, a drop in world temperature, and more rain than imaginable follow suit, killing billions and destroying civilization. There is no electricity, no food, no clean water, no gasoline - no safety. The remaining humans barely survive and live in abject terror, some turning to violence, murder, cult-like religious fervor, and even cannibalism. The very act of living becomes nothing more than pure, simple survival. But what is the price of that survival? Is mere survival enough? Or can civilization be saved?I have read LUCIFER'S HAMMER a number of times; it is one of my favorites, and it is always a very exciting read. My heart pounds, full of tension, worry, and fear, and the need to keep reading, keep turning the pages. This is a very "atmospheric" book, meaning, everything feels very real and very possible as you read. Several times, I have had to look out the window to be sure I could still see the sun, and that the world was not trapped in unending rain. At the same time, my brain is also very involved in the story, as the science is valid, the plot is plausible, and the outcome very, very possible. This book makes you believe that this could happen, in both your mind and your soul. IMHO, Niven and Pournelle have written a frighteningly realistic vision of what could happen in the event of a world-wide cataclysm. Heinlein was right - the Earth IS too fragile a basket to keep all of humanity in. We NEED to get to the stars. It may be the only way to keep the human race alive for the long haul.Science fiction or disaster thriller, LUCIFER'S HAMMER is a smart, engrossing novel. It provides endless food for thought, and leaves you feeling, perhaps, a little less secure about this fragile planet we live on. Which just proves what really good writing can do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"Me? I can change during the course of a day. I wake and I'm one person and when I go to sleep I know for certain I'm somebody else. I don't know who I am most of the time. It's like you've got yesterday, today, and tomorrow all in the same room. There's no telling what can happen."These are the last words spoken in this movie. Unfortunately the writer/director Todd Haynes, took them to heart and based the entire picture on the concept, and seems to have done so with relish. The actors are fine, the cinematography is serviceable, and the music is great, but the movie was dropped into a blender and poured onto the screen for the audience to consume "as is." Several big-name reviewers applauded the film with phrases like "it brakes the mold" and one described it as an "incandescent rebus." NOTE TO SELF: Avoid incandescent rebuses!I like Bob Dylan's music and I really wanted to know more about him. Forget it. This rebus starts with a black child named Woody Guthrie (not the real Woody Guthrie) who is supposed to be Bob Dylan, although throughout the movie, he's called Jack Rollins except, of course, when he's called Billy the Kid, (a.k.a. Mister B. and other aliases), Arthur Rimbaud (not the real Arthur Rimbaud), Jude Quinn, and Pastor John. I get that these personas all represent shades or phases of Dylan's life but they make for a disjointed and incoherent movie. There is no time line. There is no continuity. The movie jumps forward and back leaving the viewer wondering if she should even try to keep track of what's going on. Word to the wise: DON'T.To make matters even murkier, there is yet another character who is the actor who portrays Jack Rollins in an unseen movie and this character is included in the jumping about of the movie. I presume that this character represents a "Meta-Dylan" but for the love of Mike, give us some help! I soon threw up my hands and decided to just enjoy the music.This movie might be art, but it is not entertaining or enlightening. If you are a Dylan groupie, then you might get more out of it, recognizing album covers brought to life or inside references that escape mere mortals. For me, I'm trying to decide if I've finally found a worse movie than NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.

BEAR'S NEW FRIEND, by Karma Wilson, is a cute, simple story about making new friends. My wee one and I love our first introduction to Bear in BEAR STAYS UP FOR CHRISTMAS, and we could wait to read another Bear book.In BEAR'S NEW FRIEND, Bear is in the mood to play, and so he goes off in search of his friends. But in the woods he catches sounds and glimpses of an unknown animal. Could it be a new friend?Told in rhythmical, rhyming verse, almost (but not quiet) reminiscent of Dr. Seuss, BEAR'S NEW FRIEND is charming story that will appeals to younger children and those learning to read alike. The rhyming words and large print make BEAR'S NEW FRIEND an easy choice for beginning readers. Jane Chapman's illustrations are pretty, colorful, detailed, adorable, and fun. They bring the words to life, and put the child into the heart of the story.BEAR'S NEW FRIEND is not quite up to the standard of BEAR STAYS UP FOR CHRISTMAS, but it is still an entertaining story, especially for fans of the Bear. My daughter is really enjoying this story, and gets a real kick out of sounding out all the words herself. BEAR'S NEW FRIEND is RECOMMENDED.

PHILADELPHIA CHICKENS, by Sandra Boynton, is an amazing find. My nearly four year old daughter received it as a gift about two years ago, and this is still one of our most favorite cds. We turn the music up loud, sing at the top of our lungs, and dance ourselves silly. The wee one really loves to see Mom-Mom being goofy, and I love her wild and wacky interpretive dances.PHILADELPHA CHICKENS sounds a lot like Broadway review. In fact, I can almost hear real Broadway tunes and lyrics when we listen to this. Each song reminds me of something I have heard before. But while the lyrics of PHILADELPHIA CHICKENS are geared toward the younger set, the music is for children of all ages, and encompasses a wide range of styles. Jazz, swing, rockabilly, torch, ballad, Caribbean, blues, big band, dance, lullaby, barber shop, and a host of other musical genres are represented on this cd. The music is big, bold, bright, and has excellent production values. Guest performers include Meryl Streep, The Bacon Brothers, Laura Linney, Eric Stoltz, Patti LuPone, Kevin Kline, Scott Bakula, and Natasha Richardson to name just a few. My personal favorite tracks include Cows (which sounds like it could be from "A Chorus Line"), Philadelphia Chickens (which sounds like the Stray Cats are performing), and Be Like a Duck (which makes mommy do a funny dance). My little one loves Snuggle Puppy (which we both walk around singing all day), the Jump Rope Song, and Please, Can I Keep It (about a "pet" that followed a little girl home). All the music is fun and fantastic, and absolutely will not drive adults crazy. This cd can and should be listened to again and again and again.The accompanying book has Boynton-typical, wonderful illustrations. All the lyrics are included, and even the sheet music can be found in the back.PHILADELPHIA CHICKENS has been enjoyed around our house for several years, and I know we will be listening to it for years to come. This cd can very easily grow with your child. I recommend that you put it in your car, roll down the windows, turn up the volume, and sing along with your child. You will be very glad you did.

There is just something about this book. Under My Hood I Have a Hat appears to strike a chord with every preschooler who hears it. This simple rhyming book tells the story of a child getting dressed to go out in cold, snowy weather. Written in a "chant" cadence, it goes through the layers and layers of clothes that must be put on just to go out to walk the dog. At the end, it expresses a humorous warning that the child, now swaddled up like a giant beach ball, must not fall, because, she "can't get up at all." This ending invariably makes my 3 year old giggle and ask if the girl in the pictures is making snow angels.This book has bright, simple, colorful illustrations that pop off the page. The chanting rhyme of the story is easy to learn and to remember. My daughter's preschool teacher tells me that the entire class loves this book and requests it often; they all end up chanting the story in unison. It is quite amazing that a book about cold weather and snow would make such an impression on young kids in Austin, Texas who have most likely never seen snow.This is a great "read to me, Mommy" book, as well as an easy beginning reader. My daughter and I have great fun with it.

I am not a big fan of The Simpsons. It is not that I dislike them, but I just never got into them; although, I have enjoyed the occasional episode. Recently, however, due to circumstances my control, my husband showed THE SIMPSONS MOVIE to our 4 and 1/2 year old daughter...and she LOVED it. At this point, I would say that she has watched it in whole or in part over 25 times. She can quote quite large portions of the script verbatim, and of course, she can sing the Spider Pig song...loudly. So, obviously, I needed to screen THE SIMPSONS MOVIE personally. (Better late than never!)And, much to my surprise, I found THE SIMPSONS MOVIE to be very fun and quite entertaining; truly much better than I had expected. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE has a fun story, many humorous and memorable moments, and is true to itself - what more could I ask for? There is nothing particularly bad or unsavory in this movie; nothing that will corrupt my four year old. (There are, however, a few things that go over her head: she had to asked her dad what a "doodle" was! Then again, she asked me to define "epiphany" for her. So, I guess you take your vocabulary words where you can get them.) The rest of my family, my husband and my 12 year old daughter, also really enjoys THE SIMPSONS MOVIE.So, quite surprisingly, I am recommending THE SIMPSONS MOVIE as an entertaining family flick. While not all of their episodes are fit for all ages, this movie works and really tickles our collective funny bone. Well done, Homer. You've still got it after all these years.

And so begins one of the most romantic movies of all time. Certainly, THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR qualifies for a secure spot in the top ten. This tale of an impossible, yet enduring love is timeless, pure, and tender - a movie never to be forgotten, a movie to be watched again and again, especially with those you love.The story of THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR is well known. A young widow, Lucy Muir, her daughter, and their housekeeper, Martha, move into a spectacular seaside house. The house is haunted by the previous owner, Captain Gregg, a curmudgeonly old sea captain who begrudgingly allows Mrs. Muir and her small family to stay. Eventually, Mrs. Muir and the Captain fall in love. However, Captain Gregg soon realizes that Mrs. Muir belongs in the world of the living, and he fades away, becoming only the memory of a dream. However, true love is immortal and lasts forever...Gene Tierney is exquisite as Mrs. Muir. Her performance is luminous; she is genuine, stunning, and wholly real. Rex Harrison is wonderful as the grumpy old ghost of a sea captain. The two have real chemistry, and the unfolding romance is sweet and touching. The rest of this small cast, including a weasely George Sanders and a very young Natalie Wood, are all excellent in their respective roles; however, this film is all Tierney and Harrison.The black and white cinematography is amazing. Robust and luminous, the play of shadow and the contrast of light and dark depict mood and tone in a manner not reproducible in color. The score by Bernard Herrmann, whose music sets the stage for the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Wells, and Ray Harryhausen, is one of his best, perfectly setting the mood for this melancholy romance.Experience this film with your family. Adults will sigh and hug at the purity of true, unconsummated love, and children will appreciate the ghost story. A treasured classic, THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR is a film for the ages. This is one I wish I could give 10 stars.

My 12 year old daughter and I really enjoyed watching NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN together. Like the original, NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 is great family entertainment - no bad language, no blood, no sex, and no real violence. Just lots of fun, laughter, and a pleasant evening together.In NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2, night guard Larry Daley has moved on and is getting rich selling his wacky inventions on television infomercials. But his heart isn't really in it; he isn't as happy as he thought would be. When Larry discovers that many of his beloved friends from the exhibits at the New York City Museum of Natural History are being shipped to permanent storage at the Smithsonian archives, he rushes to try to help them. But when the Egyptian tablet that brings his friends to life is accidentally sent along to the Smithsonian, Larry has a whole new set of problems on his hands. With every exhibit in the Smithsonian museums and the archives below coming to life, Larry must enlist the aid of a spunky Amelia Earhart, a vain and grandiose General George Custer, and a bouncy pack of Einstein bobble-heads to save the day, and make everything right.In NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 is a laugh out loud funny movie, full of some very creative action sequences. The museum exhibits still come to life, but this time they include famous paintings that you can jump into (reminiscent of Mary Poppins), pop art sculptures that chase you around, all manner of aircraft (from the Wright Brothers' first plane to a launching Apollo space craft), the gifts from the gift shop, and even a gigantic Abraham Lincoln from the Lincoln Memorial. Hank Azaria as the evil pharaoh and Amy Adams as a perky, independent Amelia Earhart are delightful additions to the NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2 cast, and Robin Williams is as charming as always Teddy Roosevelt. The special effects are pretty cool, and the jokes and slapstick keep on coming.Is the story predictable? Yes. Did we care? No! NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN is a great family summer film. It won't change your life, but it will help you forget your troubles for a few hours and have some fun with your loved ones. The entire family will grin, giggle, and out-right guffaw, with several good, old fashioned belly-laughs thrown in. NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 2: BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN is an excellent way to spend a cozy popcorn evening together. And who knows, your kids might even learn a little history!

Imagine if you will, a man so disillusioned with life that he quits his successful singing career to become a proofreader. He sees in the world nothing good, only evil and trickery; and he spends his evenings smoking pot and playing chess - and losing because he's always stoned. He never shaves, drives what I think is a vintage Yugo but might actually be a dumpster with wheels, and is so depressing to be around that his own 11-year-old daughter feigns homework to avoid him. Meet Matthew Broderick's latest character, Ben Singer. What an odd name for a singer. Hmm. Did I mention that he used to sing kid's songs?In short, WONDERFUL WORLD is anything but. It is boring and painful to watch. Usually, when you sit through a character's train wreck of a life, there's a pay-off at the end where we all learn a valuable lesson. While technically this might be true of WONDERFUL WORLD, I certainly missed it.So, in a nutshell, Ben Singer-proofreader-pothead has a roommate named Ibu. When you can understand what Ibu is saying, he is very upbeat and tries to show Ben that maybe things aren't as ugly as they seem. Then something happens to Ibu, and Ibu's lovely sister, Khadi, comes to town from Senegal. She picks up were Ibu left off. A bunch of nearly meaningless stuff happens, then the movie ends.The best scene in the movie: When Khadi teaches Ben's daughter to dance.Best line in the movie: "You don't believe in magic? Magic is all around us. Feelings are magic." This is really profound, IMHO, but clearly over the head of the main character.There's really nothing to recommend WONDERFUL WORLD. And I must admit that I did not like seeing Matthew Broderick in this role. Anyone could have played the character of Ben Singer. Matthew is cut out for grander things.So, now you might now ask, why 2 stars? Why not one? Well, throughout WONDERFUL WORLD, the original music, songs, and guitar playing of Dan Zanes is heavily featured. Dan Zanes is a wonderful children's musician. My young daughter has several of his CDs and we have seen him in concert a few times. He is engaging and energetic, and his tunes are memorable and fun. For that reason alone, I sat through this film. Dan Zanes is always a treat, and the oportunity to hear him play the acoustic guitar was not to be missed.

TOY STORY 3 is the perfect bow completing the Toy Story package. My mother, 13 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and I all loved every minute of it. TOY STORY 3 made all three generations of my family laugh, cry, and cheer. Yes, the story is basically the same story told in the other two movies - the toys have to get back to Andy - but we certainly didn't care. Disney has pulled off a perfect hat trick, a golden triple crown with the Toy Story trio, and they are all endearing family movies. And it is possible that TOY STORY 3 is the best of them all.TOY STORY 3 is clearly meant to be the end of the Toy Story saga: Andy is going off to college (really? It seems that just yesterday he was 6 years old and getting a Buzz Lightyear doll...where does the time go???). Andy must decide what to do with his favorite toys; he hasn't played with them in years, but they are still his favorites and have sentimental value. What should he do with them? Through an unfortunate but completely plausible mistake, the toys end up donated to a preschool. Although most of the toys believe Andy sent them there on purpose, Woody is ever loyal, and knows that this is not the case. He finally convinces the others of their error, and now, of course, the toys must get back to Andy before he leaves for college. Will they ever get home? Will they get there safely? Will they make it before Andy leaves? What will become of them?TOY STORY 3 is delightful entertainment for the entire family. Disney does many things right, but their stories with the message of being true to yourself and true to your friends are always outstanding. These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many forms. And TOY STORY 3 is one of their best.With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike will are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim. The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect. Added to that are some wonderful gags that will leave you laughing until you cry. Look for guest appearances from many toys from your childhood; they will bring back many happy memories and lots of giggles. Especially endearing was the return of Barbie, who at long last met her Ken. Their interaction, as well as Barbie's stunning declaration that "Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!" (she really has brains under all that blond hair!), is hysterical and memorable.Take lots of tissues to TOY STORY 3, especially if you have a child who has left for college. Andy makes a beautiful decision in the end, and clearly, all the toys we have come to love will live happily ever after. Well done, Disney. The entire TOY STORY trilogy is a true classic, one that will be loved by generations to come.

And I was not disappointed. Disney got it right. They actually made the movie I have been waiting for most of my life.I have read the classic book, The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, literally dozens and dozens of times, and I believe that this film is destined to become a classic in its own right. It is a family oriented movie that stays quite true to the original story. A warning to the purists, the are a few minor name changes, for some reason.This movie is excellent, entertaining, and enjoyable on all levels: phenomenal special effects and make-up; breathtaking cinematography; and, of course, top-notch performances. Performances in this film are across the board superior, extremely expressive, and display a wide range of emotions.The plot is complete, and, as stated earlier, it matches book almost perfectly. It is fast-paced and action-packed; a thrilling ride from beginning to end. It was truly worth the wait.

SUNSHINE CLEANING is billed as a "quirky comedy/drama." However, it isn't quirky, it isn't comedy, and it really isn't drama. From the traumatic first scene to the Hollywood ending, there is not a single moment of levity. SUNSHINE CLEANING is a series of predictable train wrecks that the viewer can see coming for miles and miles.SUNSHINE CLEANING is the story of Rose, a single mother who works as a housekeeper. Rose needs money to get her smart but mischievous son into a private school, since the public school can't seem to handle him. At the suggestion of her married cop boyfriend, Rose and her deadbeat sister decide to enter the crime scene cleanup business - totally unprepared and with no knowledge of what they are doing. The rest of the film is a chronicle of their business, their relationships, and their family.I really wanted to like SUNSHINE CLEANING. I usually enjoy the efforts of Alan Arkin, Amy Adams, and Emily Blunt, but the writers really let these fine actors down. The characters are unlikable and mostly unredeemable, and the plot is plodding, depressing, and unfocused. There is no charm, no warmth, no color, and no depth.By the end of the film, I felt absolutely nothing for any of the characters. I was never immersed in the story; I really didn't care about it one way or the other. SUNSHINE CLEANING is cloudy and gray, with no chance of sun. Sorry folks, I just can't recommend this one.

HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS!, by the incomparable Theodor Geisel - aka Dr. Seuss, is a true Christmas classic. It is a story of hope, faith, and epiphany, and of discovering the true meaning of Christmas. Who else but Seuss could tell such a story so entertainingly, in so few words, and all in rhyme?That grumpy old Grinch thought Christmas was about presents... and food and decorations and things of that vane. But he stole everything, down to the crumbs too small for the mouses, and Christmas still came! It came joyfully, noisefully, loudy proclaimed! This made our grizzled old Grinch puzzle and puzzle until his puzzler was sore, and until he realized that Christmas was so much more. He returned all the presents and food for the feast, and then our grinny Grinch, himself, the Grinch carved the roast beast.Only Dr. Seuss could spread the true, pure message of Christmas without any reference to religion. He communicated directly to children of all ages in his wonderfully wacky and wise rhyming, teaching us all about faith, hope, and love.What a perfect book for this Christmas season. I introduced it this year to my 3 1/2 year old, who just loves it. As her new Christmas favorite, she requests it nightly. And I am happy to read it to her again and again.Happy Holidays, everyone!

I just finished reading Isabel Manning Hewson's children's book THE LAND OF THE LOST to my 5 year old daughter. This book has three chapters, and we read one a night together. Our copy is very old and beat up. It was published and printed in 1945 and given to my mother by her little sister for Christmas that year. My mother would have been about 7 and my aunt around four. Clearly, both of them loved this book, considering its dilapidated condition. Pages are ragged and torn, but lovingly restored (most likely by my grandmother) and the binding is cracked. But I know that THE LAND OF THE LOST was one of their favorites, my sister and I vividly remember it from our childhood, and I now I am sharing it with my wee one.THE LAND OF THE LOST is a magical tale of a young boy and his little sister, who, because of their kindness to a very special fish, are granted the privilege of visiting the undersea Land of the Lost. Here, anything ever lost on Earth can be found. In this book, the children visit the Land of Lost Toys and Table Land, where they both find some old and beloved friends. Adventure abounds, good wins out over evil, and eventually the children return safely home, with promises of future visits under the sea.THE LAND OF THE LOST is a delightful and entertaining adventure for young minds, as demonstrated by the three generations of little girls who have loved this book. The illustrations are still vivid and colorful all these year later. The detail in them is exquisite; the most gorgeous of them taking a full page.THE LAND OF THE LOST was adapted from a radio program, and I intend to see if any of these has survived. I have a vague, faded memory of listening to this book on an old record album. To my knowledge, this is the only book based on THE LAND OF THE LOST ever published. But this story ends with promises of more lands and more adventures under the sea. If I can find those old radio programs, perhaps my daughter and I can have further adventures.

WALL-E is truly a stunning achievement. Any movie that captivates my 3 year old, enchants my 11 year old, and entertains my husband and me is a rare and real triumph. WALL-E is without question one of the best family films of the year to date.Pixar has outdone themselves with this film. The animation is truly lovely; the story is sweet and touching; the characters are vivid, engaging, and very believable; and the soundtrack is superb. I start laughing out loud the moment I heard the first notes from the songs of Hello, Dolly (much to the chagrin of my 11 year old), and the giggles continued on for the rest of the film. Basing the entire plot on two songs from a well-loved movie musical was a bold and brilliant move by the creators of this film, and the idea certainly caught my fancy. As an added bonus, the tribute to the HAL 9000 and the accompanying 2001 underscore had me rolling in the aisles. Very clever!The story of WALL-E is told in great depth and detail with very minimal dialog. Using beeps, gestures, and yes, even expressions, this charming robotic romance comes to life before our eyes. Who needs words? My three year old certainly did not. This was her first adventure to the movie theater, and I was a bit concerned that the lack of dialog would be an issue, but she was absolutely enthralled. When EVE finally started to respond to WALL-E, she whispered to me "Look, Mommy, they're friends now." When EVE "got sick" (my daughter's words), she told me "Mommy, WALL-E is taking care of EVE." Later in the film, she cried out "EVE, EVE, you have to save WALL-E." She really got it, every bit.Now, I do have to say that "save the earth from the ravages of evil mankind" propaganda really has no place in a children's movie (and thus it loses a star), but fortunately it only minimally detracts from the robots' touching love story and their "directive" to save humanity and return them to Earth. WALL-E is a cute, funny, romantic film, just right for the entire family. Highly recommended.

In MY BIG FAT SUPERNATURAL WEDDING, nine of today's top paranormal fantasy writers try to answer these questions and more.In "Spellbound," author L.A. Banks, tries to answer the question "What would happen if a Hatfield tried to marry a McCoy?"

Elrod's "All Shook Up" takes a look at what can happen when Elvis makes an appearance as your wedding singer."The Wedding of Wylda Serene," by Esther M. Friesner, shows us what happens when a god straight out of Greco-Roman mythology gets bored and decides to marry a human.In Lori Handeland's "Charmed by the Moon" we are invited to the wedding of two werewolf hunters.

The stories in MY BIG FAT SUPERNATURAL WEDDING are light, fluffy, and fun - a very nice summer distraction - and the short stories within a nice break from big, heavy novels.

IMHO, this is where The Southern Vampire Mysteries, featuring our favorite mind-reading waitress who dates vampires and werewolves, gets confusing and weird (but still very, very enjoyable). Yes, here, in DEFINITELY DEAD, book 6 of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series. Never mind all the bizarre, supernatural goings-on of the previous 5 books; they all made sense. Of course they did. Anyway...In DEFINITELY DEAD, we discover that Sookie's long-estranged cousin, Hadley is dead. Not only dead, but she has been a vampire, and is now DEFINITELY DEAD. Slayed, if you will. Not coming back, not rising. The thing is, this is news to US, but not news to Sookie. Hence the confusion. Did I miss something? Well, apparently I did. It seems that Ms Harris wrote a short story, entitled ONE WORD ANSWER, that has appears in a couple of short story collections. I read that story after I had read all 10 Sookie Stackhouse novels, and AH HA! The beginning of DEFINITELY DEAD suddenly made sense. ONE WORD ANSWER contains events and characters that are very pertinent to events in DEFINITELY DEAD. If possible, read ONE WORD ANSWER first.Now, I still enjoyed DEFINITELY DEAD quite a lot. I just wish I could have avoided all that confusion. So, let's see, in DEFINITELY DEAD, Sookie has been named as the executor of Hadley's estate and must travel to New Orleans (the seat of the Queen of Louisiana) to clear out Hadley's apartment. Not there 24 hours, Sookie discovers a dead body in her cousin's apartment, meets a coven of good witches, becomes involved in deep and harrowing political intrigue within the Queen's Court, and meets a new man, who just happens to be a were-tiger. On top of all of this, she needs to solve her cousin's final murder. Whew! Sookie certainly leads an exhausting life. But as always, our fair Sookie does what she needs to do, makes all wrongs right, and gets the guy. And that is what we love about our girl.DEFINITELY DEAD is full of new characters, new situations, and new dangers. Charlaine Harris's easy, straightforward writing style continues to draw us in and make us believe. And that is what makes this series fun, charming, and delightful. And what keeps us coming back for more. I just wish that such important events didn't take place "between the books."

The TV sitcom is not dead. Chuck Lorre has resurrected the universe of comdey with The Big Bang Theory, Monday nights at 7:00 PM CST. Hysterically, laugh out loud, belly-bustingly funny, this show is not to be missed.The premise is fresh and fun: two young, genius, nerdy, socially awkward science professors named Sheldon and Leonard share an apartment. Across the hall, in moves Penny - a sweet, beautiful, blond bombshell who waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory. Leonard immediately falls for her. Penny cares for Leonard, but she loves him like a brother...It is a phenomenon how unbelievably funny this show is. The writing is smart, creative, and consistent. The characterizations are masterful and avoid being over the top. The acting and comic timing are inspired. This cohesive ensemble cast jelled from day one, and has never looked back. As comical and wacky as this show is, every time I watch it, I think "I KNOW these people. I know people just like them." (Yes, I am a science and engineering geek. I have a Master's Degree in physics.) Somehow, in the midst of all the zany hilarity, the world created by these talented folks is real, comfortable, and familiar. The details in this show are amazing, and add to the realism. Clearly everyone involved in this effort cares, and that is what makes Big Bang work so well.If you haven't seen Big Bang, give it a try. Your sides will ache from laughing so hard. As an added bonus, the theme song is catchy and sung by Bare Naked Ladies. And don't forget to hit pause as Chuck Lorre's placards pop up at the end of each episode.

My daughter has had her copy of I LIKE IT WHEN..., by Mary Murphy, for nearly two years. Even thought it is geared toward babies and toddlers, my 3 year old still finds this book very enjoyable and very comforting. It is still a good book to fall asleep to.I LIKE IT WHEN...is a series of interactions between a young penguin and an adult caregiver. With no names or defining details, the penguin pair can be mother/child, father/child, grandparent/grandchild, older sibling/new baby. The only requirement for the type of relationship displayed is love. Beginning with " I like it when you hold my hand" and "I like it when you read me stories," continuing on to "I like it when you hug me tight," and "I like it when we dance around," and ending with a big "I love you," I LIKE IT WHEN...models simple intimacies so important to a growing child. The illustrations are simple, cute, and colorful, and the message is reassuring, endearing, simple, and clear.Even though we both have I LIKE IT WHEN...memorized, my daughter still wants me to read it to her page by page, so that we can act out each interaction. Each page demonstrates a very special one-on-one communication between adult and child; something that all kids find fundamentally necessary in their young lives. This book basically just makes my daughter feel happy and loved. And that makes me happy, too.

Part of the fun of Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mysteries series, is that her heroine, Sookie Stackhouse, seems to be a magnet for trouble. The supernatural creatures of our world are drawn to Sookie, and in DEAD AS A DOORNAIL, the 5th installment of this series, Sookie is leading quite the supernatural parade. But that is all part of the charm and delight of Sookie; the more trouble she gets into, the stronger and braver she gets. Sookie is a sweet, appealing character who takes no prisoners when "things" get in her way or threaten the ones she loves.Let's see...first we have her brother Jason, who is now a were-panther (bitten not born). We also have Bill, Eric, Sam, and Alcide, all of whom at one time or another have had a romantic interest in her - Bill and Eric are vampires, Sam is a true shape-shifter, and Alcide is a werewolf. Added to that is the fact that Eric had lost his memory and become romantically involved with Sookie; now, he has his memory back, but he has no memory of their relationship, and Sookie has no idea what to do about that. On top of all of that, someone is killing Sookie's supernatural friends, Sookie gets shot, AND her house is burned down! Then add to that, detectives investigating the death of an old enemy, and Alcide's fight to the death to become packmaster. Whew! How much can a girl take???Well, our Sookie can take quite a lot, and that is part of the reason we love her. DEAD AS A DOORNAIL is a headlong dive into danger, one that pretty much never quits. And Sookie handles it all with her normal charm, aplomb, and southern grit, thanks to Charlaine Harris's smooth and appealing writing style.Suspend your disbelief and enjoy DEAD AS A DOORNAIL. It is quite a ride. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both new and old Sookie fans.

This time, the Pigeon wants to stay up late. Let me tell you right off that in this Pigeon book, the Pigeon sounds exactly like my three and year old daughter, and she knows it. Reading DON'T LET THE PIGEON STAY UP LATE! in our house results in much laughter, fun, and high hilarity.That Pigeon rants, he wheedles, he pleads, he bargains, he uses logic, brute force, and subtlety - he just wants to stay up late. Despite the yawning and the drooping eyelids, he proclaims "I'm not tired" over and over again, just like I wee one that I know well. He even carries a stuffed bunny lovey...just like she does.DON'T LET THE PIGEON STAY UP LATE! is one of my daughter's favorite Christmas gifts this year. She loves that Pigeon, and she especially loves this book. She clearly recognizes herself in this one. Mo Willems certainly knows how to reach children. His illustrations, colors, and of course that Pigeon speak directly to kids. They can easily relate to the Pigeon, and that keeps them coming back for more. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

My husband and I watched PAPER MOON with our 11 year old daughter the other night. What a fun, sweet, thoroughly enjoyable family movie. I can't think of a better way to spend an evening at home.Filmed in the early `70s in black and white, PAPER MOON tells the story of recently orphaned 9-year old, Addie, who falls in with con man Moses Pray. As it turns out, Addie is perhaps a better con than Moses is, and the two of them set out to relieve some unsuspecting widows of their butter and egg money. While swindling their way across the mid-west and surviving a series of hilarious misadventures, Addie and Moses develop a genuine affection for each other, and learn the true meaning of what it is to be a family.Ryan and Tatum O'Neal both give outstanding performances as the erstwhile father and daughter. In fact, Tatum won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in PAPER MOON, the youngest actress to do so. Other cast members, including Madeline Kahn and John Hillerman are equal to the task; all the performances complement each other perfectly. The chemistry between all of the characters is genuine and very believable.The black and white print adds to authentic feel of the film. You really believe that you are driving around the dust bowl during the Great Depression. Costuming, sets, and locations are all dead-on Depression era, and lend to realism of this film. Additonally, there is no sound track to this film. You hear every chirp of a cricket, every creak of a stair, every rumble of a car motor. This really puts the viewer there, in the movie, in the story.Full of a wonderfully effective combination of sentimentality, humor, and cynicism, PAPER MOON stands the test of time. Watch this film with your family. I guarantee, no matter what the age, everyone will enjoy the evening. In fact, my oldest enjoyed this film so much that she "forgot it was in black and white."

EVERYBODY PLAYS AIR GUITAR is my four year old's favorite Joe McDermott CD. And mine, too! Joe McDermott is a Texas home-grown children's entertainer, known for his humorous, fun, and intelligent lyrics. His original, toe tapping tunes make kids and adults alike what to get up and dance. My daughter and I also love to sing along at the top of our lungs while driving in the car.EVERYBODY PLAYS AIR GUITAR contains 10 original songs, written in typical catchy, snappy Joe McDermott fashion. My wee one's particular favorite is Sport Comes to the Rescue, about a loyal pup who helps his young human and saves him from a number of "imagined horrors," including a bad dream. My personal favorite is the title track, EVERYBODY PLAYS AIR GUITAR, which provides kids (and their parents!) very specific instructions on exactly how to play the air guitar. The lyrics are down-right funny, and my little girl laughs hard every time we air guitar together. Other fun favorites include Our Family Car is a Helicopter, and Ride, Ride, Ride, which is an interactive song that ends up with an aborted attempt to ride a porcupine. Ride, Ride, Ride always produces a long outbreak of the giggles.All of Joe McDermott's CDs and songs are engaging and entertaining, especially to the youngest crowd. The fact that mom and dad can enjoy these songs, too, is icing on the cake. We have been lucky enough to see Joe in concert several times, and my child loves listening to the CDs and remembering the fun we had at the concerts.EVERYBODY PLAYS AIR GUITAR is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for children of all ages.

Dan in Real Life is a very sweet film, and my family and I enjoyed it quite a lot. Actor/comedian Steve Carell plays Dan, a newspaper advice columnist who has been a single parent to three daughters (two of them teenaged!!!) since his wife died.Carell plays the part of the grief-stricken, surviving parent, just trying to keep moving, in an extremely believable fashion. His interactions with his three daughters are extremely realistic; although, I would have grounded the middle child for the next 30 years. This, however, was part of the excellent portrayal of just how numb, withdrawn, sad, and lonely Dan really is. Carell's acting in this film is a very nice departure from his other roles, and he does quite a good job. The other members of the cast are also very realistic and enjoyable to watch.There is a really feeling of family in this movie, and it is lovely to see a basically normal, functional family coping with the joys and hardships of everyday life. There are emotional moments, humorous events, tense scenes, and an overall celebration of family life throughout, which come across as real, and are a true pleasure to watch.Yes, this movie is a bit predictable. However, it is warm, touching, and quite enjoyable. I recommend this film to just about anyone.

The Pigeon has enamored both my three year old daughter and me since we discovered this series earlier in the year. Author Mo Willems is a true genius; he manages to connect with toddlers and preschoolers every time, in every new book. Because the Pigeon sounds and reacts just like they do, the Pigeon series attracts and then keeps a child's attention through many, many readings. These books quickly become permanent favorites.In DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS!, the Pigeon wants (you guessed it) to drive a bus. However, the bus driver has already left the scene and warned the young reader that they should not let the Pigeon drive. The Pigeon then weedles, rants, cajoles, and stomps, trying to convince the reader to let him do what he wants. My youngest loves that the Pigeon speaks directly to her, and she loves answering him right back. Believe me, with my daughter in charge, that Pigeon is not going to drive the bus.DON'T LET THE PIGEON DRIVE THE BUS! also teaches the lesson that you can't always have what you want. If my child is asking for something she can't have, I just reminder of this story, and she understands. She doesn't like it, but she understands.Books that get kids to interact with the story are pure gold and give children a life long love of reading. I personally thank Mo Willems for this series; it has made a lasting impression on my daughter and on me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I just watched the new TINKER BELL movie with my family, and I must say that we are all enormously enchanted. Do you know how fairies are born? (Do you remember from Peter Pan?) Do you know how and why our special friend is named Tinker Bell? Do you know where Tinker Bell got her signature green dress? All of these questions, and more, are very satisfyingly and entertainingly answered in Disney's new animated film, which, IMHO, is destined to become a classic. This is by far one of the best films, animated or not, to come out of the Disney Studios in a long time.In TINKER BELL, a new fairy is born and has to find her way in Neverland (although it is never called Neverland, it MUST be...the movie makes it clear that the fairies live "second star to the right and straight on `til morning..."). Along the way she makes new friends, many mistakes, and discovers who she is. TINKER BELL has a clear and important message for all children, and adults, everywhere: be happy with who you are; each one of us is special and unique, and that is a very wonderful thing. TINKER BELL ignites the imagination, and leaves you full joy and happiness.The animation is breathtakingly lovely. The colors are rich and brilliant, the action smooth and pure, and the characterizations are charming. You can easily fall in love with every one of the characters. The voice talent was cherry-picked from some of the best. Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, is a perfect choice for Tink. Sweet and ingenuous, she is conveys Tinker Bell exactly as you imagine. The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, America Ferrera, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Kathy Najimy, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the delight of this film. As an added bonus, there was nothing scary in TINKER BELL; nothing to frighten or upset children. No one dies; no one is particularly evil. A little self-centered, yes, but that is the worst of it. This is quite simply a sweet, charming, enchanting tale that will please children of all ages for many years to come.The ending made both my husband and me "laugh-cry" with delight. (You know what I mean, the tears were flowing, but we were laughing with glee at the same time.) At the end of the movie, Tinker Bell returns a very special object (that you just might recognize) that plays a very special song to a very special child. It made me very happy, gooey, and sentimental, and that is a wondrous thing. I am going to have this smile on my face for many days to come. And my family and I will be watching this again, very soon - a sign of a truly excellent film.

THE SANTA CLAUSE has been one of my Christmas favorites ever since it first came out. IMHO, it is an instant classic. I love this happy, sentimental, magical, feel good movie. Starring Tim Allen, THE SANTA CLAUSE will make you laugh, make you cry, and help you remember the true meaning of Christmas. You WILL believe in Christmas magic.Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin (S. C., hint, hint), a divorced father doing his best to celebrate Christmas with his son. In typical fashion, Scott is late picking up his son, the turkey catches fire in the oven, they end up at Denny's for Christmas Eve dinner...overall, a complete disaster. Later, as they read The Night Before Christmas, they hear a sound out on the roof. They run outside to investigate, startling Santa, who falls off the roof. Scott tries to help Santa and ends up putting on the Santa suit to keep warm. However, there is a Santa Clause on a card in the pocket of the coat...he who wears the suit becomes the next Santa. Scott and his son end up in the sleigh delivering presents, and then at the North Pole meeting the elves. Of course, no one believes them the next morning, and even Scott thinks it was all a dream. But the Santification process has already begun, and eventually even Scott has to believe...Tim Allen is just excellent as both Scott Calvin, a toy company executive who has lost his way and as Santa Claus. His transformation from one to the other is perfect: his sense of shock and disbelief vanishes as learns the joy and magic of actually being Santa. Tim's performance is warm, genuine, real, and very believable. You want this to be real, and you want Scott Calvin to be Santa. You feel happy, joyful, and uplifted. The supporting cast is all wonderful, and the elves are just terrific. The sets and effects comprising the North Pole and Santa's Workshop are just right. They make you believe, which is the whole point.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SANTA CLAUSE for the entire family. We watch it several times each Christmas, and love it every single time.

Have you been exhausted since the day your child was born? Does your child year old produce an overwhelming volume of artwork in a single day? Does your child seem to remember everything he or she has ever seen or heard in context? Is your child a "drama-queen," constantly seeking attention and control? If you answer yes to these questions, then your child may have an "active-alert" temperament. And this book, LIVING WITH THE ACTIVE ALERT CHILD may be your lifeline. YOU ARE NOT ALONE!My wee one, now age 6, has been precocious since the day she was born. She is exceedingly bright, extremely verbal, has a memory like a steel trap, and has never once in her entire life stopped moving or talking. The more tired she becomes, the more stimulated she gets, to the point where she is still demanding, "I'm not tired!" as her head hits the pillow and her eyes snap shut. Even then, her dreams are very busy and her nights can be quite restless.Hence the exhausted and frustrated mom. Luckily, LIVING WITH THE ACTIVE ALERT CHILD has helped me to better understand my child, let me know that I am not alone, and given me some wonderful tips to help both my child and me cope with her active-alert temperament. I do think we have been lucky, however. My husband and I were already using a number of the recommended coping mechanisms instinctively, and we both have always accepted our daughter for who she is. But there are definitely some areas where we could improve our approach to this unique child and her unusual gifts, and LIVING WITH THE ACTIVE ALERT CHILD has provided additional techniques. I've already tried several of the recommendations with my daughter, and, lo and behold, they seem to work. Halleluiah!Most importantly for me, I now have literature and documentation to also help her teachers understand my child. She is definitely a kinesthetic learner; she has to move. Hopefully, LIVING WITH THE ACTIVE ALERT CHILD will help me help my daughter and her teachers and will let all of us work together as a team to provide here the best learning environment possible for her learning style.LIVING WITH THE ACTIVE ALERT CHILD provided me with great peace of mind, helped me to be an even better parent to my child, and has prepared me to be the best possible advocate for my child that I can be.

Joss Whedon fans, get ready to rock! DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is ROTFLMAO funny. Campy, corny, and tongue-(firmly)-in-cheek, this ~45 minute web blog will delight Buffy/Angel fans, Firefly fans, super hero/super villain fans, sci-fi fans, musical fans, and pretty much anyone who just likes to have a good time. DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is completely unexpected and is Joss Whedon at his outlandish best.Joss Whedon apparently got bored during the 2008 writers strike and conceived this little gem as an "online mini-series event." Neil Patrick Harris is terrific as Dr. Horrible, an arch-villain wanna be who has a video blog about his life goals: to join the Evil League of Evil and to win the heart of Penny, the girl of his dreams. NPH is in fabulous voice. I had the privilege of seeing him sing the lead in RENT a number of years ago; it always amazes me that little Doogie has such pipes! Nathan Fillion steals the show as the comic superhero, Captain Hammer. Vain and self-aggrandizing, Fillion plays this roll to a tee. Felicia Day is sweet and sentimental as the love interest of both.The singing is outstanding, and the songs, written by Whedon and crew, are engaging, humorous, and toe-tapping. Perhaps this should have been the all-sing, all-dancing blog...who knows. The songs are all quite diverse, representing a variety of musical styles. DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG is an off-beat, crazy, rollicking good time. Log on to Dr. Horrible's Blog today (really, it is a real website!), and have a look for yourself.

My young daughter recently received a copy of Curious George for 3rd birthday, and we have been reading at least once a day ever since. Of course, George is a monkey, but he is also an allegory for all children everywhere. My daughter clearly sees herself in George (as do I!). At the page where George is playing with the telephone and accidentally calls the fire department, she said, "See Mommy, you told me not to do that." When George gets into trouble, this book conveys age-appropriate lessons about actions and consequences. Every child in the world gets into trouble every now and then, because of their innocence and curiosity. But mom and dad will always be there to help them out, and THAT is the message of this book.This is another classic that I am thrilled to be passing on to my child. It is beautifully illustrated with bright colors and attractive drawings. We laugh with George, and discuss his consequences. She knows that it a story. My little monkey just loves Curious George, and I am certain that yours will, too.

I loved this book. It has become one of my favorites. If you are an animal lover, you will fall in love with this story.I am not a huge Dean Koontz fan, but this book hooks you right from the beginning. The pace is fast, the tension builds swiftly, and the characters, both two-footed and four-footed are charming and compelling. You can't turn the pages fast enough, and you certainly cannot put it down. The plot twists and turns, and you have to know what comes next. The device of teaching Einstien to read is truly unique. This is a truly an excellent, extraordinary, entertaining read.And Einstein can come live with me...anytime.

A little heat, a little sweet, and a little smoke. These three elements are perfectly blended together in FISCHER & WIESER RAZZPOTLE ROASTED RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. Taste it straight out of the bottle, just a little dab on your finger. All three tastes are clear and present, mixing delightfully on your tongue. Pour it over a brick of cream cheese and spread it on a cracker. The cheese adds a creaminess to the sauce, gently calming (but not eliminating) the heat. Truly excellent as a glaze for pork - my family gobbled it up.BOTH kids, ages 3 and 11, come back for multiple helpings whenever we use FISCHER & WIESER RAZZPOTLE ROASTED RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. That in itself screams volumes. My husband and I both agree that this sauce is delicious. And we can't wait to try it in other ways. My husband is thinking up new recipes as we speak. FISCHER & WIESER RAZZPOTLE ROASTED RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE SAUCE enhances the flavor of whatever we use it on.Some people have complained about the raspberry seeds. While they don't particularly bother me, I can see that FISCHER & WIESER RAZZPOTLE ROASTED RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE SAUCE could be even nicer without them. If you really can't stand them, run the sauce through a strainer. It will be worth the extra effort.Go ahead and try FISCHER & WIESER RAZZPOTLE ROASTED RASPBERRY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. I guarantee, it will razzle-dazzle you.

Well, I certainly don't know how it is possible that I have not read STELLALUNA, by Janell Cannon, until now. I recently purchased this very popular children's book for my three year old daughter, on the strong recommendation of a friend. STELLALUNA is a lovely, touching story, and both my daughter and I are enjoying it very much.A young fruit bat named Stellaluna is separated from her mother and winds up in a nest of baby birds. The mother bird, finding another baby in her nest, feeds and raises Stellaluna along side her own babies, Flitter, Flap, and Pip. But mother bird doesn't know anything about being a bat, only a bird, so she teaches Stellaluna to be the best bird a bat can be. Stellaluna learns to eat bugs, sleep right side up, and fly during the day. She is not a graceful bird, and she doesn't like the bugs, but Stellaluna tries very hard to be like her nest mates. In the end, Stellaluna is reunited with her family and learns what it means to be a beautiful and graceful bat. But she remembers her bird family, and knows that she, Flitter, Flap, and Pip will always be friends.This sweet little book is a new take on the story of the ugly duckling. While Stellaluna was a clumsy bird, she certainly is a graceful bat. Likewise, her bird friends can't do a lot of bat things, but they are perfect at being beautiful birds. STELLALUNA is a very simple story that teaches many great lessons. Be kind to others. Be yourself. Being different doesn't mean you can't be friends.STELLALUNA's illustrations are quite lovely...they simply glow. The soft muted colors, the rich texture, and intricate details bring this story to life. The expressions on the faces of the bats and birds make it easy for young children to relate to these characters. "Look, Mommy," said my wee one, "look how happy Stellaluna is! She found her mommy!"STELLALUNA is a charming tale that makes these little fruit bats seem cute and sweet, and a lot less icky. With 2 pages of bat notes at the end, this book tries to teach children (and adults!) the truth about bats and to dispel some of the negative feelings that have built up around them. Highly recommended.

Who knew that our friend the mouse from IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE had a Christmas book? My 3 year old and I discovered IF YOU TAKE A MOUSE TO THE MOVIES this year just in time for the holidays. We love MOUSE/COOKIE very much and were very excited to read this Christmas version.Like MOUSE/COOKIE, IF YOU TAKE A MOUSE TO THE MOVIES, by Laura Numeroff, teaches young ones about sequential action and consequence. For example, if you take a mouse to the movies, he is going to ask for some popcorn. If you give him popcorn, he will want to string it for a Christmas tree, and then he will ask for a tree to hang it on. As the book continues, a tree is bought, a snowman is made, a snowball fight ensues, etc. The story eventually comes full circle, with the mouse wanting some popcorn, and if you give him some popcorn, he will want to go to the movies.My wee one delights in IF YOU TAKE A MOUSE TO THE MOVIES almost as much as the original MOUSE/COOKIE. Christmas themed, funny to both of us, and just the right length for bedtime - what else could you ask for? The illustrations by Felicia Bond are bright in color, rich in detail, and very, very fun. The pictures make you giggle as much as the story. That mouse is just so darned funny.There are several other books in this series, and I really am surprised that we do not own more of them. I will be remedying this lack very soon. This series of books is engaging, entertaining, and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for both pre-readers and early readers.

THE PIGEON FINDS A HOT DOG! is another installment in saga of the Pigeon, and this time he wants to eat a hot dog. In fact, the Pigeon is about to eat his favorite dish, a mouth-watering, delicious hot dog, when the Duckling appears. The Duckling, a new character to the Pigeon books, says he has never had a hot dog, and, not so innocently, sets about trying to get the Pigeon tell him more and more about hot dogs. The Pigeon gets VERY frustrated, going off on one of his famous rants, while the Ducking just sits there, looking sweet and nave. So that he can finally eat his coveted hot dog, the Pigeon does the only thing he can do to get the Duckling to stop interrupting him...he shares his hot dog.Author Mo Willems has done it again, spectacularly, with this one. THE PIGEON FINDS A HOT DOG! teaches a fine lesson about sharing, one that my three year old understood immediately. She loves to tell the Pigeon that he should share with the Duckling, and she is very happy every time he does. We also love seeing the Pigeon express a gamut of emotions as he reaches this decision. Mom acts them all out, and the wee one thinks this is hysterically funny. "Do it again, Mom-Mom!" is a familiar cry.Kids are drawn to these books because the Pigeon, and, in this case, the Duckling, reacts just like they would. The illustrations are clever and very expressive, and it is clear exactly what the Pigeon is feeling. The other day, my child was quite angry. I said, "Hey, you've got smoke coming out of your ears, you must be really angry." She started giggling and said, "Just like the Pigeon, Mommy," and the impending melt-down was adverted.I highly recommend THE PIGEON FINDS A HOT DOG! for anyone, but most especially for those who are already Pigeon fans.

I'll try not to use words like "self-indulgent" and "masochistic media" when describing ANOTHER EARTH. It will be hard. And apparently, I've already failed. But here goes.Drunk driving high school student kills a child, a pregnant mother, and puts professor husband into a coma. She goes to prison for 4 years. When she emerges, she ends up in a romantic affair with the un-coma'ed widower. Then she tells him who she is. Oh, and there's another Earth in the sky.I'll confess that I went into ANOTHER EARTH expecting to hate it, but just like the proverbial train wreck, I had to see it through to the end. The part about the other Earth struck me as a gimmick. Or something on the order of a question asked by partying college students in the wee small hours. Like "if you could be any animal..." In this case, the question is "if there was another Earth with exact copies of ourselves..." Never mind the science. The movie ignored it. No tidal waves, no disruption of planetary orbits. (I have a huge ability to suspend disbelief, but this film really over taxed it!) And at the end, no thought was given to a VERY important question. To describe it would spoil the ending. If that's possible.I usually like Fox Searchlight films, like Whip It and Waitress. But ANOTHER EARTH is uninspired, obvious, and clearly used the "ANOTHER EARTH" facet as a ploy to set it apart from other navel gazing fare.

IRON MAN is a total blast. My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan. As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world. When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect. In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes. Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions. Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world. Of course, nothing is ever easy...All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable. Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real. The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil. The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun. The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come. I sure hope so. I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for "truth, justice, and the American way."

Of the four romance novels that I received for my birthday (romance not being my genre), I think I liked WORD OF HONOR, by Dani Sinclair, the best. This seemed more than your typical romance novel. WORD OF HONOR has a little mystery and a little intrigue to add spice, and perhaps a little substance, to the romance.WORD OF HONOR is the story of Hannah Richards, the son she gave up at birth Adam McKay, and his father Jack McKay. Hannah and Jack had a whirlwind romance while in college. Their tumultuous affair ended rather suddenly, before Hannah knew she was pregnant. Jack had always believed that Hannah had left him for a more "appropriate" match. It is ten years later, and Hannah has gone looking for the son she put up for adoption. She is quite shocked to learn that Jack has raised the child by himself. Jack has told Adam that his mother is dead, and dreads Hannah's intrusion on their small family. However, as always, all secrets are revealed and problems overcome, and yes, again, everyone live happily ever after.But WORD OF HONOR has a bit of suspense, too. There is a bank robbery to solve, a stalker on the loose, and some strange accidents that may not be accidents. I turned the pages pretty fast on this one, wanting to get the mysteries solved. A light thriller, I really got into this story and needed to find out what was going to happen next. This is a very quick read; about 250 pages in two hours.The one thing I did not like about this book is that it is apparently part of a series. There were references to people, places, and events that I did not always understand, and from the family trees in the front of the book, I am guessing that the series spans several generations. A little more explanation of some of this history would have made this book even more enjoyable.WORD OF HONOR is still a nice brain vacation, but one with a little action and excitement. In my opinion, that raises it up a notch. I am temped to try another book by Ms. Sinclair.

I am a disaster movie junkie. Really, I can't get enough of them. An evening with popcorn and a good disaster movie sounds perfect to me. And 2012 should have been the grandest disaster movie ever made. Instead, 2012, while visually magnificent, leaves something to be desired.2012 is the retelling of the Biblical flood story. Scientists detect the coming of the greatest solar event in the history of man, and realize that the world as we know it will come to an end. They tell the president and other heads of state, who, of course, keep it secret from the rest of the world. In a grand attempt to save mankind, great arks are built, in secret. But who will be selected to man these arks? Will the human race survive?As stated earlier, this movie is visually stunning. The disaster effects are amazing and actually feel believable. I loved California falling into the Pacific. However, 2012 tries to be every cheesy disaster movie ever made, instead of being its own story. There are remnants of Earthquake, Volcano, The Poseidon Adventure, Airport, Tidal Wave, Deep Impact, and pretty much every cheap disaster movie made for television by the Sci Fi, pardon me, SyFy channel. It also borrows quite a bit of story line from the classic When Worlds Collide. I really wanted 2012 to be its own story in its own right. Instead, it was just a remix of, well, everything. And seriously, John Cusack must be the luckiest man alive. To survive disaster after disaster after close call gets a little monotonous. The audience stops caring. Especially since none of the characters are particularly engaging.Overall, if you like high impact action/adventure with incredible visuals, you will like 2012. If you want a little more story with your disasters, then this may not be a film for you. It is flawed, clich&eacute;d, and leaves you wanting more.

I just saw this film with my husband and 10 year old daughter...excuse me, she says 10 . The Water Horse was thoroughly enjoyed by all. It is a treat for the entire family, sparking the imagination of young and old alike.A near-tear jerker, set in WWII, on the banks of (we find out later) Loch Ness, this is a whimsical story of healing, full of adventure, laughter, friendship, and love. The beginning is filled with an appropriate amount of tension, drawing the audience immediately into the tale. As the story unfolds, we learn a little about Scottish folklore, a little about WWII behind the Allied front (way, way behind), and a lot about a young boy, who conquers his worst fears, helped by the love of his unique best friend. In the end, they save each other.The cinematography is simply breathtaking. The location, the lighting, and the camera angles all work together to immerse the viewer in a rural Scottish village of the time. The starkness of the loch and the beauty of the rugged land create a perfect setting for this film.I have no idea how the creature was created. I assume CGI. But let me tell you, it really did look like the animal was swimming in a bathtub full of water - splashes, slop, and all. I completely believed it. Near the end of the film, I found myself yelling at the characters to save Crusoe...to the high amusement of my family.I highly recommend this film for children of all ages. You will not be disappointed.

In Christy Tillery French's THE BODYGUARD, we meet our feisty, loveable, wacky heroine, Natasha Chamberlain, for the very first time. That is, of course, unless you are like me and are reading this series in reverse order. By some strange cosmic joke, I received the third book first and the first book last, but do you know what? It just doesn't matter. The books in Ms. French's Bodyguard Series are self-contained, easily read, and thoroughly enjoyable in any order.In THE BODYGUARD, we get the full background on Nattie, Striker, Pit, Bigun, and Roger. How they met, how their relationships developed, and how they all came together as the "family" they are. The story opens with Natasha, the office manager for an investigation firm, getting her big chance to become an investigator herself. To do that, she must first take on the role of bodyguard for Roger Valentine, a ridiculously wealthy, nerdy, reclusive computer software genius who has received death threats. Natasha reluctantly accepts the job, and we are off at break-neck speed on a non-stop, action-packed, edge of your seat adventure. Natasha has a kind of wide-eyed innocence combined with a strict moral code; she cannot stand to see any harm or cruelty done to any living thing, and she is going to single-handedly take on the world, righting one wrong at a time. Of course, this leads to many extremely bizarre, humorous, and dangerous situations, which, for the reader, leads to a fun and exciting read.Christy Tillery French is unmistakably a very talented author; however, there are two specific elements of her style that clearly standout. The first is her characters. They are so authentic, so well developed, so alive, so real that they feel like family. People who live next door. People you have known all your life. I really like these characters, and think of them as friends. The second is how Ms. French draws you into her stories with action blasting off on the first page...from the first paragraph. No wind up, no pitch, just BAM! You are instantly submerged in her world. And she does this without losing any detail or information important to the story. It all flows together for a breathtaking read.I believe the fourth installment of the Bodyguard Series is due out late this year. Having read the first three books quite quickly this summer, I will miss Nattie, Striker, and the gang until then. I have very much enjoyed my time with these new friends. I can't wait to see them again. Oh, Christy...

I knew next to nothing about the events depicted in this film prior to watching it. It is a real eye opener. Charlie Wilson's War is based on a true story. It is proof that, in this country at least, one caring, determined man can make a difference to the world.This is a fast paced story, based on real events of the early 1980s. Essentially, Texas' colorful 2nd District US Congressman, in just 7 years, enables Afghanistan to be the first country to defeat the Russian Army, signaling the beginning of the end of the Cold War.This film has an outstanding cast, all of whom deliver strong, believable performances. Tom Hanks is true standout, playing Charlie Wilson to a tee, depicting him in full-blown real life with all of his flaws and foibles, as well as his patriotism, big heart, determination, and guts. Julia Roberts is excellent as a wealthy Texas society woman who is used to getting what she wants. Philip Seymour Hoffman truly amazing as the CIA agent on Charlie's side. His comic timing is superlative, making you laugh out loud. Amy Adams is beautiful as always as Wilson's much put upon administrative aide. The entire supporting cast is top notch.The script is just plain fantastic. It teaches us as well as being extremely entertaining. The dialogue is interesting and witty, and it rings true. The story is told with a host of emotions from plain amusement to sheer horror. The viewer becomes invested in this story and these people.I highly recommend this film. You will enjoy it, and you will learn a little history.

I've read this book several times, and still really enjoy it. The "time travel" plot is quite compelling: What would you do if you had the opportunity to live your life again, while retaining all of your previous knowledge? The protagonist has the opportunity to do just that. Not once, but several times. This book is truly a fresh take on that age old question.The book itself is fast paced, with tension building right from the start. The author's detailed descriptions of his character's initial shock and confusion and his subsequent actions and reactions connect instantly with the reader; the reader becomes immersed in the protagonist and his experiences. We see the world many different ways from the same pair of eyes, as his life is lived over and over and over again. Overall, the writing is just superb, with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. This is a page turner - one you cannot put down.

THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS is one of the sweetest little books that I have ever read. Although I purchased it for my 3 year old daughter for Valentine's Day, the love and lesson of this book is appropriate any day of the year. THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS is a new favorite at our house, still asked for day after day as part of our bedtime ritual.The author of THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS is Felicia Bond, who is the illustrator of the enchanting IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE series. In THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS, young Cornelia Augusta is walking a long when it begins to rain hearts. She catches one, then another, then many more; and she takes them home. She studies them closely and discovers that each one is unique. Their uniqueness captures Cornelia Augusta's imagination, and she uses them to make unusual and special Valentine's cards for her friends, each of whom appreciates her thoughtfulness.THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS is a simple, charming story that connects with the hearts of young ones and their parents alike. The illustrations are outstanding: bright, colorful, and extremely imaginative. THE DAY IT RAIN HEARTS is endearing and tender; a perfect story to share with family and friends.In this day of prepackaged, store bought, mass produced Valentine's Day card, the time, effort, and thought that Cornelia puts into each of the individual cards is a delightful lesson. My wee one is enamored of this idea, and I realize that next year we will be making some very special Valentines by hand. THE DAY IT RAINED HEARTS is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

WHIP IT is a very well done, quirky, surprisingly enjoyable teen film that works for adults, too. My husband and I watched this with our 12 year old daughter, and we all liked this movie very much. With little gore and mild sex that is more referred to than shown, WHIP IT is definitely refreshing and fun.WHIP IT is the story of Bliss, a seventeen-year-old diner waitress in a backwater town near Austin, Texas. Bliss is basically a good girl, doing everything her overbearing mother asks, including competing in (and often winning) beauty pageants. But Bliss really wants to make more of her life, and to find her own path. When she finds a flyer advertising a Roller Derby match in Austin, she and her best friend sneak out to the big city and have an adventure. Something about the Roller Derby and the women who compete strike a chord in Bliss, and one of the teams invites her to try out. Before she quite knows what is happening, Bliss makes the team and becomes a Hurl Scout. Bliss then has many life decisions to make, each of which has significant consequences. Can Bliss find the path that will make her truly happy?Ellen Page is delightful and dead on as Bliss. I really like the heart and soul that Ellen puts into her characters. The rest of the cast is excellent and equally talented (including director Drew Barrymore, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kristen Wiig), but Ellen Page truly carries this film. WHIP IT is well paced, slow and thoughtful where appropriate, yet full of excitement and great action at the Roller Derby. And I always like the messages from Ms. Barrymore's films...girls can do anything. Something I definitely want to instill in my 12 year old.WHIP IT is a unique combination of sports action, teen coming of age, and family genres that works and works really well. It was great evening together for my entire family, and a movie we are still talking about. WHIP IT is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Pan's Labyrinth is a beautifully made film. It is also a very disturbing and violent fairytale. Think back to the original dark Grimm fairytales that give children nightmares (NOT the prettied up Disney versions), and you will be getting close.This movie is an adult fantasy, and absolutely not recommended for children under 18. It is extremely intense, quite violent, and deals with very mature topics: death, war, poverty, fascism, and human brutality. Conversely, this film also takes us into a fantasy world that helps a small child escape from her horrific reality. This bizarre combination ignites the viewer's imagination. It is emotionally gripping; we become wholly invested in this young girl's tragic life.This unusual story is filled with some remarkable acting. The cinematography is graphic and stunning. The film has an almost dream-like quality to it, which serves to enhance the brutality of the "real world" scenes. We ache to see this girl escape - to be safe - yet, we know that she cannot. At least not in the real world. But, just perhaps we hope, the fantasy world can help her.Although very disturbing, Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing and unexpected triumph. I give it my highest recommendation.

KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is a wonderful family film. My entire family - my husband, 11-year old daughter, 3-year old daughter, and me - all absolutely love Kiki. We have watched it many, many times, and it is still as fresh and cute and captivating as it was the first time.KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is the story of a 13-year old witch-in-training (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), who, in the tradition of her people, must leave home for a year, and make her own way in the world. She must find a new city and provide it a service. Her mother, whose talent is potion making, serves her city as a sort of cross between a pharmacist and a doctor. Kiki leaves her family at midnight on a beautiful, warm night with just her broom, her cat Jiji (voiced by Phil Hartman), and father's transistor radio. Once Kiki finds the perfect city, she settles right in to help. Since she has no special gift other than flying by use of her broom, she naturally sets up a delivery service, delivering packages and messages all over town.Kiki learns about many things over the course of the year: responsibility, how to support herself, trust, belief in herself, loyalty, friendship, and even a first crush. She slowly finds her own way, learning and growing as she goes. By the end she is stronger, more sure of herself, and settled in her new community. She has made a life, through learning life's lessons.Myazaki's animation is, as always, simply delightful. The rich textures and delicate details bring his characters to life. It is the little nuances that draw you in: the way the wind tousles Kiki's hair, the expressions on Jiji's face, the depth of the background scenery. The pallet is soft and lovely. The entire film is quite gorgeous.As I said earlier, my entire family is enthralled by Kiki's coming of age story; none more so than my youngest daughter. For Halloween last year (2007), she wanted to be a witch. I asked her if she wanted to be a witch like the one in the Little Einsteins' Hansel and Gretel episode or one like Kiki. "I want to be Kiki, Mommy! I want to be Kiki!!!" She was very definite on that point. So she had a black dress, red shoes, a red hair bow, a small broom, and a stuffed Jiji (ordered from Japan!). She was so excited and so cute. I think the impression that KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE made on a then 2 year old speaks volumes. This quiet, simple story of learning to be happy with and to trust in yourself is timeless and appeals to all ages and generations.

KNOWING is an odd but interesting film. While it is not what you expect it to be, it certainly holds your attention to the end. Spooky and creepy, yet surprisingly and strangely uplifting at the end, KNOWING is a unique and unusual movie that comes at you from a lot of different directions.KNOWING is many things, many genres all woven together. It starts off almost as a horror film, with a young girl, Lucinda (Lara Robinson), haunted by "whispered" voices that only she can hear. The voices compel her to write down a series of numbers and to seal them in the school's time capsule. Lucinda then disappears and is later found locked in the school's basement with bloodied fingers and terror-filled eyes. Now fast forward 50 years to 2009, and the opening of the time capsule. MIT astrophysics professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) and his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) are present at the opening. Caleb receives Lucinda's envelop, the one containing the series of numbers. When this happens, we realize that Caleb, too, can hear "the Whisperers," and this is no coincidence. As John begins to unravel the shocking mystery of the numbers, the Whisperers step up their contact with Caleb, sending John into a fury of protective, parental rage. At this point the movie has become a mystery/disaster film: do these numbers really predict what they seem to predict, can the predictions be changed, how is his son involved, and what does it all mean? John needs empirical evidence to believe anything, and in this case, he is getting that scientific evidence in spades. As KNOWING reaches its bombshell conclusion, the genre switches again. With an end that is both sad and hopeful as well as filled with Christian symbolism and references, this film melds sci-fi and religion in an extraordinary and thought-provoking way. While you may be taken aback by the ultimate conclusion, it certainly is a "revelation" that will make you question what you believe. Free will or predestination? You will have to draw your own conclusions.The plot of KNOWING is fresh, bizarre, and intense. I was riveted to the screen from the beginning. Very few book or movie plots surprise me anymore, but this one kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing until the very end. I always enjoy Nicholas Cage, and his performance of man who has seen and experienced way too much is excellent. His gut-wrenching decision at the end is the right one (IMHO), but as a parent I can certainly understand the devastation of that decision. The special effects in KNOWING are out of this world, especially the disasters that John witnesses - they are outstanding; I was literally gasping for breath and cowering in my seat. The underscore of KNOWING is a perfect accompaniment to this film. It kept my heart racing, my pulse pounding, and the air filled with tension. Wow.It is actually very hard to write a review about KNOWING. It is certainly NOT a feel good movie. But it is provocative and mind blowing. Whether you believing free will or determinism, religion or science, or you can blend it all together in your own belief system, KNOWING will make you reconsider what you believe and why you believe it. RECOMMENDED, especially for those who want more than a light, fluffy film.

The Darjeeling Limited is an extremely odd and quirky little film. The cinematography is beautiful in both location and detail. The Darjeeling Limited itself is quite exotic and colorful, and provides us a unique look at train travel in India. Additionally, native citizens of India are used throughout the film, which adds weight to the authentic feel. However lovely, though, the plot and character development are things left to be desired.The plot is a rambling stream of consciousness that barely held my interest at the time, and, in retrospect, wasn't that interesting after all. The character development is thin at best, leaving the audience scratching their proverbial heads as to who these people are, how they are related, and why we should care. (Eventually you get it, but it takes far too long.) The acting is passable but predictable: Owen Wilson is a jerk and drives his family nuts, Adrien Brody just looks depressed and brow beaten, and Jason Schwartzman has no depth whatsoever as the youngest, skirt chasing brother.I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. But nothing about this film made me CARE about it, so I really cannot recommend it.

Stardust is an extremely charming and very entertaining film, full of humor, action and adventure, a kingdom to be won, evil witches to overcome, magic, and, of course, love, true love. It is a wonderful fantasy that gently envelops you, draws you in, and leaves you feeling happy and satisfied. Narrated by Sir Ian McKellen, his serene and dulcet tones set the mood perfectly.All the actors give top-notch performances, from the stars, to the supporting cast, and onward to the cameos. Claire Danes is simply lovely in the lead role, playing the fallen star with innocence, grace, and a special "luminosity." Charlie Cox is a likeable, sweet, yet bumbling oaf who transforms into the perfect knight in shining armor. Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderfully wicked and evil. Peter O'Toole has a brief appearance as the dying king, lending, as always, a touch of class.And then there is Robert DeNiro. Not wanting to give it away, this is a DeNiro never before seen. He is brilliant, outrageous, and fun. Bravo.Also worthy of note, is the peanut gallery of ghosts (i.e., the dead sons of the king), who's numbers continually increase. Their running commentary adds fun and amusement throughout the film. It is a clever touch.To the last detail, this film has it all. The lush settings and scenery are exquisite. The special effects are outstanding. The score fits the film and the action to a tee.I highly recommend this film. Like The Princess Bride before it, Stardust is destined to become a classic. You will not be disappointed.

THE STATE OF FEAR, by the impeccable Michael Crichton, is a fast-paced, action-packed thriller based in the world of environmental science and the very controversial subject of global warming. This is a thought-provoking work of fiction that makes you question what you "know," as well as why and how you know it. IMHO, any good book or movie will entertain, make you think, and teach you something. THE STATE OF FEAR does all three.THE STATE OF FEAR posits whether or not global warming is real. It shows us how scientists and data can be manipulated by governments and environmental groups to make the world believe something that may not be true. It examines the length to which radical organizations may go to make the world believe what they want us to believe. And it does all of this in an absorbing, gripping, spellbinding page turner that keeps the reader on the edge of his seat. The wily twists and turns keep you in suspense and the plot rocketing along until the very last page.The only flaw I find in this book is the beginning, about the first 100 pages or so. So much fragmented back story, so many characters, so many facts are being thrown at the reader that the book is very hard to follow and get into. I have to admit that I almost stopped reading, but I am so glad that I did not. This book will make you question everything, and perhaps we don't do enough of that. Is global warming real? Are we, the public, being manipulated with out knowing it? I'll leave it to each reader to decide for himself...

I won't pull any punches: HANNA is just plain awful. It's a movie with multiple personalities that don't mesh. It's almost like the 3 main actors, Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, are in three separate movies that occasionally bump into each other and none of them make sense. The basic plot is that Cate Blanchett is a CIA manager, and Eric Bana used to be one of her agents about 15 years before. They were involved in a Super Soldier experiment that came to an end at which point, Bana was supposed to kill all the participants. He didn't. Instead, he takes baby Hanna into hiding and trains her up to be a lethal asset. Why? Because Bana thinks Blanchett will come for her. After 15 years. So what does he do? He turns on a homing beacon to tell Blanchett here they're hiding. Why? And why would she care after 15 years? Then all heck breaks loose after which Ronan goes on a coming-of-age odyssey I won't bore you with. And then it ends.HANNA has kinds of Felini-esque imagery which just adds to the what-the...? factor. If you like quirky, stream of conscious movies, then you might like HANNA. But you couldn't get me to watch it again for all the Pecan Sandies in the Keebler Treehouse.

I really enjoy Agatha Christie, and I usually love old movies, but this first film version of her mystery novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE is extremely disappointing. Directed by Rene Clair and containing an all-star cast, this film should be a truly excellent thriller; unfortunately, this screen play is a terrible adaptation of Ms. Christie's stellar novel. The dialogue is awkward and stilted, the suspense never really builds, and the ending is utterly predictable.As the story goes, eight people, a butler, and a housekeeper are invited by a Mr. U. N. Owen to spend a weekend at a mansion on a barren island somewhere off the English coast. Each person has in some way been responsible for a death, and these sins have gone unpunished...until now. One by one, the 10 individuals are each killed in a manner consistent with the nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians. This excellent cast of well-known character actors and actresses is lead by Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Judith Anderson, and C. Aubrey Smith. As the characters in this film attempt to identify their murderer, they eventually come to the conclusion that it must be one of them, since they are the only people on the otherwise deserted island. The mistrust and suspicion then kick into full swing. At the unsatisfactory end of the film, the identity of the murder and his reasons for killing are a real let down.This film starts with all of the ingredients to be a winner: a known director, well loved actors, not to mention a brilliant story. Unfortunately, once the dreadful screen play is mixed in, the ingredients all curdle, and the over all result is extremely unpalatable.

I recently reread Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, by Gregory Maguire, because I wanted to see if it was appropriate for my soon to be 11 year old daughter. She has recently become a fan of the Wicked musical score, and really wants to see the show when it comes to town next year. While the musical is suitable for audiences of all ages, I knew about 4 pages into my reread that the book is NOT appropriate for my 10 year old. I'll let her read it when is about 18. However, that did not stop me from enjoying this story of an "emerald in the rough" a second time.This is the story and back story of The Wizard of Oz as told from the perspective of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. If you think about it, until now, we have only been told Dorothy's, Glinda's, and the Wizard's side of the tale. As that telling goes, those three are the side of good, and the Witch is on the side of evil. But is she really?This creative and fascinating novel gives us in vivid, colorful detail the life history of the Wicked Witch of the West, from her birth to her death. Maguire's Oz stays true to that of L. Frank Baum, while making it more real, more alive, more textured. Not everything is as it seems from the more familiar tale. Glinda is a spoiled brat, the Wizard a corrupt politician, and Dorothy, well, Dorothy commits manslaughter and then skips town. And Elphaba is a victim of circumstance. She tries to do the right thing, but is always misunderstood. It seems that fate is against her.Wicked gives you all the little background details that you wanted know, but were afraid to ask. You will learn the history of the flying monkeys, the ruby slippers, the green skin, Glinda's gowns, the yellow brick road, and more.Wonderfully written, beautifully paced, and supremely entertaining, Wicked is the ultimate study of good and evil, of how similar they are, and of how hard it can be to tell the difference. Believe me, you will never look at Glinda the same way again, the little twit.

THE UNINVITED is a true classic, one of the best haunted house stories that I have ever seen. Filmed in black and white in 1944, the film relies on the play of light and shadow, an eerie underscore, and suggestion and innuendo to scare the audience. There is no blood, no gore, no grizzly monster, and none are needed. With a talented cast and an excellent plot, this movie sends shivers up your spine, makes hairs stand up on the back of your neck, and has you jumping out of your seat at the slightest provocation. This is a true, old-fashioned thriller the way it should be done.As the film opens, a brother and sister, played by Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey, buy a beautiful, old house high atop a sea cliff. As they settle in, they soon discover some "oddities" about the house: a locked, mysterious room, slamming doors, sobbing in the night, unexplained chills, the sudden scent of mimosas, wilting flowers, animals afraid to ascend the staircase. Later, they discover that two young women died in the house nearly 20 years prior, quite possibly murdered.THE UNINVITED is exquisitely shot against the Cornish coast; some of the scenes are simply breathtaking. The direction, by Lewis Allen, is quite inspired. Allen cleverly hints at more than he shows, and imagination easily fills in the rest. The tone is uneasy from the beginning, immediately giving the audience the jitters. The simplicity of light and dark, black and white, interesting camera angles, and the thrill of suggestion are used brilliantly throughout the film.THE UNINVITED is highly recommended. If you want to spend dark, rainy Sunday afternoon with a creepy, chilling film, THE UNINVITED is truly your best possible choice.

Vampire stories, books, movies, etc., have always been a guilty pleasure of mine. I mean real vampire stories, not teen angst vampire stories. Even has a youngster, I got a thrill watching old Dracula films. Additionally, the urban paranormal detective genre is one of my favorites, so it really is a surprise that I have never read any of the Southern Vampire Mysteries...until now. On a recent vacation I had the luxury of time and read all 10 Sookie Stackhouse novels back to back, in the space of about 2 weeks. They were perfect vacation reads: fun, easy, and fast-paced. DEAD UNTIL DARK started the series off with a bang and propelled me right through the entire series to date.Sookie Stackhouse has a "disability," as she calls it; she is a telepath and can hear the thoughts of the world around her. Over the years, she has learned to block out all those unwanted thoughts, but it is exhausting to keep her shields up all the time. Until she met Bill. You see, Bill is a vampire. When a viable synthetic blood substitute was invented by the Japanese, vampires around the world came out of the coffin, so to speak, and joined society. Bill is the first vamp that Sookie has ever met. And, miraculously, Bill's mind is blank to Sookie. Being around Bill is quiet, peaceful, restful...or is it? While being involved with a vampire may be soothing to Sookie's mind, her life is suddenly a chaotic mess, and she ends up with much more danger and adventure than she ever bargained for.DEAD UNTIL DARK is a delightfully odd mix of genres: chick-lit, paranormal, romance, and mystery all rolled up into a fun little package. The pace is fast and intense, the writing style is simple and easy, and the characters are unique and very likable. And Charlaine Harris certainly knows how to captivate her audience.Overall, I found DEAD UNTIL DARK (and ALL the Sookie Stackhouse novels) to be a perfect vacation read. DEAD UNTIL DARK made it very easy to relax my brain. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I just sank into Sookie's world, stayed there, and let all my cares drift away. And that is exactly what any good novel should do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

CITY OF EMBER is a post-apocalyptic fantasy. I have not read any of the books on which this movie is based, and, in fact, had never even heard of CITY OF EMBER prior to seeing this movie. However, my husband and I both agree that watching this simple movie makes for a nice, entertaining evening at home.Hundreds of years in the past, the leaders of Earth realized a great cataclysm was coming that would destroy mankind. To preserve the human race, a large, self-sustaining city, named Ember, was built deep underground. The plan was for humans to live there, safe from the world above for 200 years. So that they would not miss what they never had, there were no references to the world above anywhere in Ember. After the first generation died out, it was as if the human race had always lived in Ember. The secret was entrusted only to the mayor, who passed the timer and the secrets of the world above on to each successor. Unfortunately, the seventh mayor of Ember died suddenly, before passing on the secret. Now, many, many years have passed, and the CITY OF EMBER is failing. The equipment that was meant to power the city for only 200 years is decrepit and can no longer be repaired, and they are running out of food. Soon the final darkness will come, and with it, the death of the CITY OF EMBER and the remainder of the human race. Of course, the city builders planned a way out of Ember at the end of their 200 year exile; it just has to be found in time. Young Lina Mayfleet and her friend Doon Harrow believe that there must be a way out. Lina finds part of a message from the original builders, which seems to be instructions for leaving Ember. Even though it is against the law to leave the city, Lina, Doon, and Lina's little sister, Poppy, attempt to follow the instructions. But will they make it in time?CITY OF EMBER is engaging from the beginning, with hints of the crisis to come, and the creation of Ember. The city itself is very well done; the decaying Ember is detailed with depth and color; you can feel yourself underground. Additionally, CITY OF EMBER enjoys the presence of several well known actors including Tim Robbins, Bill Murray, Mary Kay Place, and Martin Landau. Overall, the performances by these strong actors, as well as the rest of the cast, are entertaining, if not completely believable. The young leads, Saoirse Ronan and Harry Treadaway are delightful, although it is a bit typical and implausible that only these children can see that Ember is dying and can find the way out, and that all the adults are unaware of and unable to cope with what is happening.The biggest problem with CITY OF EMBER is the ending. It is very rushed and lacks the punch and detail needed for a really outstanding finish. It feels as if several key points were left out, perhaps to keep this movie short for a younger audience. The discovery of the builders' intentions and the way to the surface happens too quickly, instead of unfolding in a slow and suspenseful manner. Additionally, there are scenes missing after the ending; scenes that would have wrapped the movie up nicely and put a more satisfying bow on the end.As stated above, CITY OF EMBER is enjoyable and fun. We liked it, in spite of the obvious flaws. CITY OF EMBER is a nice evening at home for the entire family. However, I will be ordering the books very soon, so I can read for myself the details that were clearly left out.

There is just something about this film, WAITRESS, something indefinable that I can't quite put my finger on. WAITRESS is a surprisingly delightful film, and my husband and I really enjoyed watching it. This is definitely a great "snuggle on the couch together" movie.WAITRESS is the story of Jenna, a waitress in a small southern pie shop in a small southern town. Jenna invents and bakes delicious, original pies (for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert), all with crazy names, like I Hate My Husband Pie, Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie, Marshmallow Mermaid Pie (invented when she was 10), Bad Baby Pie, and Falling in Love Pie, all which reflect what is happening in her life at that moment. Jenna is unhappy in her marriage to her abusive husband Earl, and has discovered she's pregnant. Things get complicated and heated and even funny when she falls for her new doctor and he falls for her.WAITRESS is charming and poignant; it runs a gamut of emotions. It is a relaxed, lazy film that slowly unfolds as layers of taste, texture, and intrigue are added. Kerry Russell shines as Jenna, breathing life and love into the character. Nathan Fillion is enchanting as Dr. Pomatter, her quirky, loveable doctor, bringing more than his typical charming self to this role. The other cast members, including writer-director Adrienne Shelly, bring realism and warmth to WAITRESS. And the cherry on the top of this scrumptious pie is Andy Griffith as Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the pie shop, who grudgingly dispenses advice, wisdom, and poetry, but is really an old cream puff deep down. Joe has a true affection and respect for Jenna, and he does what he can to help her overcome her lot in life.Sweet, fun, touching, and vibrant, WAITRESS is an unexpected movie that draws the audience in from beginning to end. You care about these characters and want what is best for them. And what is best may surprise you. WAITRESS is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

First the bad news: BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was hated by 65% of Rotten Tomatoes critics.Now the good news: I ain't one of them.BATTLE: LOS ANGELES is about evil aliens attacking LA. This is a great movie. As a former Los Angelina, it was fun seeing the City of Angels destroyed by beings from another world. The action is well-paced and the military portrayals feel authentic. The characters are believable and engaging. Honestly, my husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie. When BATTLE: LOS ANGELES was over, we felt like we had just beaten the Soviet hockey team.So why the negativity from the critics? My first thought was that they didn't like that this was a war movie, albeit against aliens. In fact, that's what one critic said. She seemed to think the filmmaker was sneaking her some Afghanistan V8 disguised as fruit punch. Hello! It's called BATTLE: LOS ANGELES for a reason! One critic said it lacks soul. Absolutely not! If you don't get even a little choked up, then it's not the movie that's lacking soul. Another critic complains "Se fosse espremido e engarrafado, resultaria num perfume batizado como Le Phallus." Uh, I don't know Portuguese, but Madre de Dios that can't be good.Bottom line, I enjoyed BATTLE: LOS ANGELES much more than several other movies I've reviewed. If you like what amounts to an old-fashioned Western, then by all means, give this one a look.

THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a very nice, very sweet family film. Everyone in my family - my two daughters ages 11 and 3 , my husband, and me - enjoyed this film, each for different reasons. The wee one was entranced by "that cute little guy," meaning the Magic Gourd. The 11 year old thought it was a little cheesy, but still liked it enough to watch all the way through with the rest of us. My husband and I both felt it was a good film for a quiet family evening at home, but it just wasn't anything special.In THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD, Raymond is an 11 year old boy who is not terribly motivated. He lets his parents down, his teachers down, his friends down. That is until he discovers the legendary MAGIC GOURD, which will grant his every wish. Things go well at first, and Raymond impresses all of the people that were previously disappointed in him with his new-found prowess in, well, everything. But eventually, people start getting hurt, and Raymond comes to realize that reward without hard work is a hollow victory. In the end, both Raymond and the MAGIC GOURD learn the value of hard work and earning rewards on your own.This film is Disney's first Chinese co-production, and THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a pleasant, cute film. The problem is that it just isn't anything special. While the combination of real-life and animation is very well done, and the message that hard work pays off in unexpected ways is an important one, the voice acting, including Corbin Bleu, is lackluster at best, and the dubbing is very out of synch. There is no excuse for such disappointments in a Disney film.Overall, THE SECRET OF THE MAGIC GOURD is a good choice for a quiet, fun family evening at home. Younger kids will love it, parents won't hate it, and tweens and teens will tolerate it. RECOMMENDED.

I have to admit, I've been planning the title for this review since I watched the very first episode of BEING HUMAN. The premise does seem like the set up for a bad joke. But, truth be told, BEING HUMAN is anything but a joke; rather, it is an interesting and unique look at what BEING HUMAN really means.My husband and I found this tv series quite by accident. The six episodes from the first season of BEING HUMAN aired on BBC (2008) and later on BBC America. It is a quirky, odd little comedy-drama, but one that certainly grows on you, especially if you are a fan of the urban paranormal genre.In BEING HUMAN, we meet a vampire (Mitchell), a werewolf (George), and a ghost (Annie) who end up sharing a house together in Bristol, England. Mitchell and George are hospital orderlies who are trying to lead "normal" lives. Mitchell has been killing and feeding for over a hundred years and wants no more of it. George is a recent werewolf convert and is a mild mannered young man who really has no clue how deal with his inner beast. Mitchell and George recognize each other for what they are and decide that they can help each other - George is to help Mitchell overcome those nasty cravings, and Mitchell is to keep George locked up during his time of the month. So they move in to a flat near the hospital and set up housekeeping. Things start happening in the new flat that are strange even to a vamp and a lycan. But soon, they discover Annie, the recently dead former occupant of apartment, who not only won't move on, but can't for some reason. The three settle down into their own odd little family, and try their very best to be what each one of them wants so desperately to be: normal...human... Or, at least, as human as possible. Of course, given their unique circumstances, normalcy and humanity don't come easy, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN so entertaining.The acting in BEING HUMAN is quite good and very believable. Aidan Turner as the vamp who just wants to be loved is wonderfully dark and brooding, but he has a lighter side, too. Russell Tovey is just about perfect as dorky and innocent wolf who is in total denial about his condition. And Lenora Crichlow is convincing as the newly dead ghost who can't quite figure out what is going on (although she is just a bit whiny). The three have good rapport and chemistry, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN click.As with all the best shows, the key is in the writing, and the writing for BEING HUMAN is quite good. The timing, the interactions, and the "throw away" lines all gel quite well, making BEING HUMAN something more than you might expect it to be. If you like urban fantasy, paranormal stories, or British television, then you will enjoy BEING HUMAN. And at the end of one of the early episodes, a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost do, in fact, walk into a bar.

I love science fiction and I love film noir. So as a film noir Sci-Fi flick, I thought I'd really like DARK CITY. But, not so much, unfortunately. The visuals are very nice. Actually, they're the best thing about the movie. Now that I think of it, they ARE the movie. They are reminiscent of the Hopper painting Nighthawks at the Diner. So let's put a star in the visuals box.Then there's casting/acting in DARK CITY. There is, literally, no star in that box. Mr. 24 himself, Kiefer Sutherland, plays a very poorly acted doctor. It's like he's impersonating Igor in every scene. William "Cardboard Man" Hurt actually almost works as the hardboiled detective, until you realize that his name is Bumstead. As in Dagwood Bumstead. Then it all falls apart, and you realize that this is the same actor playing the same character he plays in all his movies, from Alterted States forward. He makes "deadpan" seem downright festive. Then there's the lovely Jennifer Connelly. I'll be kind and say she's just wrong for the part, but she does manage to sing two songs fairly well. I'm guarded in my praise because one of the songs is The Night Has a Thousand Eyes, a great song to be sure, but she sings it as a slow cabaret tune. The problem is really that she seems far to innocent for the role of a cabaret singer. But compared to the headliner, Rufus Sewell, she's a dream.Mr. Sewell plays the part of a man who wakes naked in a bathtub with a murdered girl in the next room and plenty of clues that he did it, and it wasn't his first. He's also got...wait for it...AMNESIA. I don't really mind the tired old plot device, but honestly, amnesia? So he follows clues until something big happens at the end. Throughout DARK CITY, he seems to be perpetually startled. He never seems to come into his own, to actually inhabit the character until the very end. You could argue that is part of the story, but even as a man on the run, he wasn't very convincing.Then there's DARK CITY's plot. Oy vey! I'm having a hard time using the word ORIGINAL here except when preceded by UN-. There are quite a few famous stories with very similar plots or at least large sections of this plot. That wouldn't much matter if it all was executed well. For example, The Matrix, which was released the year after DARK CITY, was strikingly similar but vastly better executed. I'd watch the Matrix again, but not DARK CITY.To summarize, DARK CITY is a mess at every level. Despite middling ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and an interesting comparison in Wikipedia between DARK CITY and Plato's The Cave, I had a very strong negative reaction to the film. In addition to everything else I have described, I felt that the ending was a cop-out. Apart from the visuals, there really is nothing to recommend about DARK CITY.

But clearly the set up for the next film.RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE is the fourth installment in the Resident Evil series of zombie flicks, picking up about a year after the end of the last movie. The earth is still a barren waste land, the unaffected population is becoming smaller and smaller, and to make matters worse, the zombies are mutating, becoming even more deadly. Alice has struck out on her own and is still searching for vestiges of untainted humans. The ever-present, all-invasive, and insidiously evil Umbrella Corporation is still after Alice, her powers are still a threat to them, and she is the one remaining force that might still bring them down and save humanity.While the storylines are getting predictable, RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE is still a monster-bashing, gore-filled zombie flick which has enough surprises to keep its audience interested. The special effects are amazing, and the Resident Evil franchise can still boast that they have the coolest decapitations on record. And RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE clearly ups the ante in this area, bringing decapitations to even new heights. (There's a sentence I never thought I would think, let alone write!) Additionally, there is more slo-mo per capita here, than in any movie I've seen to date! Talk about your Matrix effect! I can only imagine what RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE looked like in 3-D. It must have been awesome.As noted above, the ending leaves you hanging, yet clearly signals that the next film is on the way. If you like good, old fashioned B horror flicks, RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE and the rest of the Resident Evil franchise are films for you. I know that I, personally, am already looking forward to the next flick. Hopefully, the unanswered questions will finally be resolved. And if they aren't, I can confidently predict that there will be another totally innovative and completely unique decapitation.

I really loved the first IRON MAN, and am very pleased that they released IRON MAN 2, so that Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., and IRON MAN (an interesting trinity) could continue their fight for truth, justice and the American way. While not as good as the first, IRON MAN 2 is still a good, fun, entertaining film, one that my husband and I really enjoyed watching.IRON MAN 2 basically picks up where IRON MAN left off. It has been 6 months since Tony Stark revealed to the world that he is IRON MAN. Stark is fighting to keep his technology from being weaponized by the government, still attempting to achieve world peace, and this time, he is also fighting for his life.The returning cast of IRON MAN 2 (Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Samuel L. Jackson) continue to be outstanding, and the newest members (Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell) are definitely up to the task. New comic book super heroes and super villains (Black Widow and Whiplash) are added to the mix, and are very fun. The special effects are top notch (especially dazzling are Whiplash's electric whips), and the plot is enjoyable, though not quite up to the level of the first IRON MAN.It looks like there is going to be an IRON MAN 3, and I hope that the get back that special "pop" that the first movie had. There are also going to be a number of spin offs, most notably one for Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. Hopefully, these movies, too, will live up to the original IRON MAN. I guess we will have to wait and see.Overall, IRON MAN 2 is very engaging, lots of fun, and definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoyed the first IRON MAN. RECOMMENDED.

For those of you familiar with my FARSCAPE: THE COMPETE SERIES review, you know that I loved everything about the entire FARSCAPE series...except for the last minute and a half of the final episode. I hated it. With a passion. I have never been so frustrated and disappointed in my life.Well, lucky for me, and FARSCAPE fans everywhere, a year after the final episode, the fabulous cast and crew were able to make FARSCAPE - THE PEACEKEEPER WARS, which was a much better, long waited, cherry on top ending to the beloved FARSCAPE series. The bow on a nearly perfect package. Whew. I thought I would be left hanging for the rest of my life!Starting seamlessly right where the series finale left off, the entire cast from the final season returned for THE PEACEKEEPER WARS, along with many other folks that we met along the way. A fitting final chapter to a well enjoyed novel, THE PEACEKEEPER WARS (originally broadcast as a mini-series) contains an entertaining plot, plenty of action and adventure, a wedding, a few funerals, a birth, and a final, satisfying ending to our story. Additionally, the cinematography is stunning, the special effects are impressive and gorgeous, and the acting and characterizations are as brilliant as always.If you've watched FARSCAPE from the beginning, then THE PEACEKEEPER WARS is the final resolution that you have been waiting for. And it was well worth the wait. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

MISS POTTER is a glorious, whimsical family film. A biography of the life and times of the beloved children's author, Beatrix Potter, this film brings to life her incredible world and vivid imagination. Sweet, joyful, and touching, MISS POTTER is not to be missed.Beatrix Potter lived a unique and rich life inside her head. Her friends, Peter Rabbit, Jemimah Puddle-duck, Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, and a host of others, jumped out of her fertile, active mind and on to the water-color pages she so lovingly painted. A spinster at the turn of the century, Beatrix Potter over came her quirkiness and shyness to become the world's best known children's author. By a sheer twist of fate, she was thrown together with a publisher who believed in her and her work. She remained innocent and naive throughout most of her life, unaware of her fame and her fortune, and under the thumb of a mother who did not understand her or believe in her. Eventually, she finds her own way, and the children everywhere, and the entire world, are much richer for it.MISS POTTER is beautifully acted with stunning locations. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger is simply delightful in the title role, and Ewan McGregor is outstanding as the one person who believes in her completely. They are magical together, making this film a joy to behold. The lush settings and locations are gorgeous; the colors leap off the screen, enveloping the audience in Beatrix Potter's life.Multiple generations of my family were touched by this this celebration of Beatrix Potter on a quiet Christmas afternoon. Entertaining and beautiful, MISS POTTER is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. My mother-in-law, Suzanne, would have adored this film.

Question: What would you get if Alice Liddell married Jack Skellington?Answer: CORALINEThe animated film, CORALINE is a deliciously eerie movie adaptation of the novel by Neil Gaiman. This dark odyssey starts with a young girl's boredom and ends with her being appreciative of her own backyard. Both figuratively and literally. It is a well-told tale reminiscent of Through the Looking Glass, The Wizard of Oz, and Hansel and Gretel. What I particularly liked about the tale was that CORALINE's parents are alive and remain so from beginning to end. Yeah for living parents!When first we see CORALINE (not Caroline, as she has to remind folks quite often) (voiced by Dakota Fanning), she is bored. She lives in an apartment with her mother and father, both of whom work from home but can't give her the attention she craves. She tries visiting the old Vaudevillian ladies who live upstairs as well as the crazy old man who trains the mice, but she just doesn't understand them. Huh. Then she finds the key and the door, and the passage beyond that's sometimes there and sometimes not. The old man says that the mice have a message for her: don't enter the passage. If only CORALINE had listened.What CORALINE finds beyond that passageway is what makes this story interesting. It's what makes all classic fairytales interesting. Temptation, morality, determination, and heroism, all wrapped up like a spooky burrito with a side order of eerie dipping sauce.CORALINE is a dark movie, full of black magic and creepy critters. Brilliantly directed by Henry Selick (who brought us THE CORPSE BRIDE, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) and Michael Cachuela, CORALINE is fast paced and contains just the right amount of spookiness. My 12 year old LOVED this film, and my 4 year old liked it, too. She did not have any bad dreams, and she completely understood that it was not real. The animation is unique and very moody - perfect for this film. The voice talent is all outstanding, but truly you are more interested in this weird and wonderful story than you are the voices.CORALINE is a MUST SEE movie for 2009 and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my entire family. We had a great time watching it together. CORALINE might not be typical family movie night fare, but it worked for us.

THE GREAT AMERICAN MOUSICAL, by none other than THE Julie Andrews and her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, is a truly sweet, absolutely adorable, totally enchanting YA tail, er, tale about a troupe of Broadway mice who live in the sub-sub-sub-basement of The Sovereign Theatre. Here, in a miniature replica of The Sovereign, the mice put on their own shows, including the hits "Hello, Mousey," "Mice and Dolls," "Felines" (the forbidden play in the mouse world); and, of course, their current production, the New Year's Eve extravaganza, "Broadway Airs."This engaging story has a charming and familiar cast of characters: Emil, the director; Harold, the aging character actor; Adelaide, the diva; young Pippin, the intern; Wendy, the ing&eacute;nue, Curly, the young comedian; Rose the comedic supporting actress; Sky, the suave leading man; Don Q, the producer; Little June, the child star; Henry, the country professor, and a host of others, all with names and temperaments taken straight from well-known musicals. As the scene opens, The Sovereign Theater is about to be demolished, and our diva, the star of the show, has disappeared! What will happen next? Will they make it to opening night? Well, as you know, "the show must go on."THE GREAT AMERICAN MOUSICAL is beautifully written in a clean, clear, simple, almost lyrical voice which makes it a pleasure to read; I can almost hear Julie Andrews reading it to me. That does not mean it talks down to children, however. All the terms of stagecraft are used correctly and consistently throughout the book, with a glossary of terms located in the back for young readers (and others) not familiar with the language of the theatre. The pen and ink illustrations by Tony Walton are very clever and quite lovely, with several of them depicting famous scenes from famous musicals, with rodent starts, of course! And check out the cover art. It pays homage to legendary choreographer Bob Fosse. Or is it, perhaps, Bob Mousse?Quite simply, THE GREAT AMERICAN MOUSICAL is a great deal of fun. I am going to recommend it to my 11 year old, but I am also going to read it to my 3 year old. I think both kids will captivated by these theatre mice, each in her own way. I know I was, and I think you will be, too. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Roman Holiday is an incomparable romantic comedy; truly one of the most enjoyable films of all time. It is also Audrey Hepburn's debut starring role, for which she won a Best Actress Oscar. At just 24, Audrey was young, stunning, talented, charming, radiant, majestic, cute, elfin, and clearly at the top of her game. Rumor has it that the credits originally were to have Gregory Peck's name first, then the title of the film, then the statement "and introducing Audrey Hepburn." After the first week of filming, Gregory Peck called the studio and the director, and told them something along the lines of "Audrey Hepburn IS this movie; her name needs to appear above the title with mine." How noble and gallant. Mr. Peck, himself, is top-notch in this role; I fall in love with him a little more each time I watch it.This movie was filmed on location in Rome, and the scenery is breathtaking, making this movie all the more romantic. My husband and I have fun pointing out all of the places we have been. The restoration is very impressive; the print looks fresh and clear; the details are vivid. It is also interesting to notice the play of light and dark, of shadow and bright. These techniques are used at their best in this film, and are lost (and perhaps unnecessary) in color films.We recently showed this film to our 11 year old daughter. It was a lazy, rainy Sunday morning, and she "didn't have anything better to do." She started watch with some token protest, and then watched quite intently. At the end, she said, "Hey, that was pretty good...and I didn't even really notice that it was in black and white!" There is hope, yet, for younger generations!This film is romantic, playful, sweet, fun, delicious, beautiful, and charming. I give it my highest recommendation for anyone.

My husband and I watched Idiocracy for a second time last weekend. Overall, the film is okay. There are places where I laughed out loud. It is a "funny-stupid" film. Not a great epic, but not complete trash either. A good choice for an evening when you need to give your brain a rest.However, this is also a "smart, funny-stupid" move. Its message stays with you. 500 years into the future, today's average Joe will be the smartest man in the world because the human race will devolve. Stereotypical "dumb" people will multiply faster than love-struck bunnies; the movers, thinkers, and doers will continue to put children off so long that they will not be able to have them. America's number one show will be "Ow, My Balls" (and if you've every seen Jerry Springer, Big Brother, The Real Life, Fear Factor, Jackass, etc., you KNOW Ow, My Balls is next); language will continue to deteriorate until it is some kind of street-valley-funk-hiphop conglomeration; technology and the very ability to make or repair anything will disappear; the president of the United States will be pro-wrestler; garbage will be piled so high that landslides threaten major cities; and corporations and advertising will rule the world. The extremely scary thing is, none of this seems completely unrealistic, or even that far off.I remember a magazine interview several years ago with the Secretary of Education. At that time he was advocating the removal of the word "antelope" from all textbooks, to be replaced with the word "deer". He felt that word antelope was too hard for America's children and that it was a somewhat useless word, since there were no antelope on this continent. Which I believe would come as somewhat of a shock to the millions of Americans who live "where the deer and the ANTELOPE play!"This movie will make you think. Which is what a movie should do.

The Eloise books are a long standing tradition in my family. My mother gave me her Eloise books when I was little, and I have passed them on to my own daughter. She is now four years old, but she has enjoyed listing to Eloise's antics since she was two. Eloise is well known and loved by all generations of my family, and I have really enjoyed sharing her stories with my own child.The Disney DVD, ELOISE AT THE PLAZA, truly captures the spirit of those original Eloise books. In ELOISE AT THE PLAZA, Eloise, delightfully played by Sofia Vassilieva, is a typical self-centered, curious 6 year old girl, who always speaks her mind, but has a heart of purest gold. Eloise likes to "help" and to "fix things," but she is only trying to make those around her happy. Of course, Eloise's version of "helping" often leaves to craziness and mayhem, but that is all part of the fun. And in the end, as with all Disney movies and Eloise book, everything always works out for the best.Sofia Vassilieva is adorable and spot on in her portrayal of Eloise, perfectly bringing this well loved character to life. The incomparable Julie Anders is superb as Eloise's loving and understanding Nanny. What a wonderful surprise to find her in this film. Jeffrey Tambor fantastically plays a very neurotic Mr. Salamone, the hotel manager, and the rest of the cast is equally entertaining.My wee one has been quite ill this week, so, as a special surpise, we cuddled up together on the couch this evening to watch ELOISE AT THE PLAZA. She simply loved it, and mom loved seeing her kid smiling and laughing after such a rough week. ELOISE AT THE PLAZA is a charming, warm, fun, entertaining family film that breathes new life into these beloved, classic, children's characters. It is a film that I am sure we will be watching again and again.

I am not a huge fan of horror. I like "thriller," but in last 25+ years most horror films have been "slasher" - blood, guts, and gore - instead of good, honest, edge of your seat psychological thriller. 1408, however, successfully returns the thriller genre to the big screen.1408 pulls you in quickly and keeps on going. The pacing is just right. The intensity of this film is excellently timed, bringing you to your edge of your seat, and then releasing you. This rollercoaster effect actually increases the "thrill" of the thriller; you do not get numb and disconnected from constant slashing and bashing, fright and horror.The performances are terrific. John Cusak is great as always. Samuel Jackson is riveting and appropriately spooky. The little girl, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, is extremely talented. The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job.As I said, there is very blood, guts, and gore in this film; it is a true thriller. It is the LACK of said blood, guts, and gore that gives this film its psychological edge, and prevents it from becoming a slash `em up film.I recommend this film. For a good, old fashioned, yet up to date thriller, 1408 is the movie to see.

I have to say it: overall, I love my KINDLE 2. This is my first experience with a KINDLE, and so far, the experience has been great. I have had my KINDLE for several months now, and if you are a voluminous reader, then the KINDLE is for you. The KINDLE lets you hold a large amount of documents, photos, and audio files in a very small and sleek space. It is perfect for business travel, vacation, or just using around the house.KINDLE 2 Pros:1. Small, compact, sleek, and attractive. The KINDLE 2 is very light weight; just a few ounces. I keep mine in a little cloth bag for protection, and I can just throw it in my purse or a tote bag for reading on the go. And it has a lovely Star Trekkian vibe.2. Easy to use. The KINDLE 2 is actually quite intuitive. The NEXT PAGE/PREVIOUS PAGE buttons are conveniently located and easy to use; I have nearly zero accidental page turns. The menu is helpful and smart, the 5-way controller is straight forward, and the keyboard is QWERTY and just a bit bigger than my Blackberry. I have no trouble typing with my thumbs.3. Battery life. When you turn off the wireless Whispernet, the battery lasts quite a long time. If you download all of your reading material before you leave on vacation, give the KINDLE a final charge, and then turn the wireless off, you should have enough "reading power" for your trip. If the wireless is on full time, the battery lasts about 4 days.4. Adding content from Amazon. This is a piece of cake! Just browse the KINDLE store, find what you want, order it, and poof!, the book is on your KINDLE. Seems to be nearly instantaneous.5. Adding content from your computer. Attach the KINDLE 2 to your computer with the USB cable. It acts as another drive that your computer can see. Simply drag and drop files in supported formats from your computer to the KINDLE. It really is that easy.6. Adding photographs. I added a bunch of photos of my family and my kids to my KINDLE, in the manner described in 5 above. It was that easy, and I now have dozens of photos to whip out and show my friends. They are quite clear and sharp, although they are black and white.7. Reading. The screen is a very nice size, page turns are fast, and to be honest, I don't even realize that I am turning pages. The speed, flow, and page content size seem extremely natural.8. Backup. When the Whispernet is turned on, your content and settings are automatically backed up to your KINDLE account on Amazon. How cool and convenient is that?!?!?9. KINDLE Support. I have sent several questions to KINDLE support and received fairly quick responses. While they are not always the answer I hope for, at least I always get a courteous response.10. Set up. The KINDLE set up instructions are clear, concise, and quick and easy to use. Set up is a snap.The KINDLE 2 is a fun, practical, convenient, easy to use mobile reading device, and I really love using it. I would happily recommend it to just about anyone. But, of course, as with any electronic gadget, I can also recommend several improvements which would clearly increase user enjoyment even more.KINDLE 2 Suggested Improvements:1. Backlight. While my husband did purchase me a clip on KINDLE light so that I could read in bed without having the room lights on, the KINDLE clearly needs to be backlit. Of courses, this will degrade the battery life, so some concessions will need to be made.2. Waterproofing. Any voracious reader loves to read in the bathtub. And you can't do that with a KINDLE. I still need paper books to read in the tub. What a shame.3. File management system. Everything that you put on your KINDLE is in one long, alphabetical list. Pictures, music, audio books, subscriptions, books, etc., are all lumped together. I would love to be able to create a file system which would allow me to put my photos in one file, my books in another, my music in a third, etc. This seems logical and obvious to me.4. Personalize screen saver. While I "simply LOVE" (heavy sarcasm) the changing screen saver of long dead authors, I would much prefer to see the smiling faces of my children on the screen saver. You would think that since I can put my photos on the KINDLE that I could use them that way. KINDLE support tells me I can't. Huh.5. Touch screen. The iphone and the iTouch have it. KINDLE needs it. Enough said.6. (Tongue-firmly-in-cheek) Padding. The KINDLE 2 needs a nice soft pad across the top. You see, I frequently fall asleep while reading. Now, if do that with an old fashioned paperback, the book gentle falls on my chest, and I never feel it. I keep slumbering peacefully. However, if I fall asleep while reading from the KINDLE, eventually, the thing falls forward and hits me in the head! OUCH! Not only am I jarringly wakened, but it HURTS, too!With just these few improvements, the KINDLE 2 would go from being an excellent reading device to a near perfect one. But until these additions are made, I am still more than satisfied with my KINDLE 2. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I can't find anyone who doesn't love THE BIG BANG THEORY. For some, it is a guilty pleasure; for others it is simply the best show on television. For whatever the reason, this surprise hit show connects with everyone. And even more amazing, Season 2 is even better than Season 1.The premise of THE BIG BANG THEORY is still fresh, fun, and ever evolving: two young, genius, nerdy, socially awkward science professors named Sheldon and Leonard share an apartment. Across the hall, in moves Penny - a sweet, beautiful, blond bombshell who waitresses at the Cheesecake Factory. Sheldon is wonderfully brilliant and "waaay out there;" he has no idea how to connect with the rest of the human race. Leonard, a brilliant, comic book loving, super-hero pj wearing, sci-fi worshiping genius helps guide Sheldon through intricacies of human interaction, while falling in love with Penny. And Penny keeps them both real, grounded, and somewhere in the vicinity of planet Earth. As their friendships develop and grow, THE BIG BANG THEORY just gets better and better.It continues to be a phenomenon how unbelievably funny THE BIG BANG THEORY is. The writing over two seasons is smart, creative, and consistent. Somehow, the characterizations are masterful and avoid being over the top, and each character continues to grow and develop. The acting and comic timing are always inspired. This cohesive ensemble cast continues jell and the relationships deepen, and this talented cast just keeps surpassing all expectation. There are so few shows that have ever given me a belly laugh in every episode; THE BIG BANG THEORY is definitely a member of the elite group, and is, in fact, leading the pack. Clearly everyone involved in this effort cares for the show and for each other, and that is what makes THE BIG BANG THEORY work so well.Several favorite and beloved episodes have come out of THE BIG BANG THEORY's 2nd season, with my personal favorite being the Christmas episode, entitled "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis." In this episode, Penny gives a truly thoughtful gift, without realizing exactly how thoughtful it is. Another favorite in my family is the "The Lizard-Spock Expansion," where we first learn of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. There are many other favorites, but these two particularly stand out.If you haven't seen Big Bang, give it a try. Your sides will ache from laughing so hard. And personally, I still think the theme, sung by Bare Naked Ladies, is the best theme song on television. It makes my feet do a happy dance every time.

This is hands down my favorite Heinlein book. A machine that will let you visit any universe, any story ever written? How wild and wonderful. I can't even imagine the fun and adventure of being able to do just that. This is truly one of the most imaginative plots that I have read. Where do I sign up?Heinlein expected his readers to be well read and well educated. He wrote books that make the reader THINK and wonder. He posed what ifs. That makes a good author as well as a good read.Because of this book, I went back and reread all of the Oz books, I read all 11 John Carter books for the first time, I tried the Dorsai novels, and more. I also found and read Heinlein books that were previously missing from my collection. This book references all the above mentioned and more. And the more you read, the more references you understand, and the better and better the book gets.The science and math in this book do not bother me; Heinlein has said in many different novels that he expected a person to be well educated and well rounded enough to birth a baby, shoot a gun, milk a cow, build a needed tool or part, and figure an orbit vector. He was a generalist, and felt the human race had become too specialized. How many specialists would survive in frontier situation in this day and age? He felt we had lost our explorers edge.As to this book, the plot is marvelous and inventive, the pacing just right, the characters are people I want to know and be friends with, the settings are truly unique and wonderful.I know that this book is not for everyone, and not even all stallwart Heinleins fans agree with me. But, IMHO, this is as good as it gets.

My fairy-loving 5 year old daughter and I have adored Disney's Tinkerbell series of movies, and TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is no exception. This movie has all the charm and joy of its two predecessors, and once again, I have to wonder why these movies have been released straight to DVD. With some of the most gorgeous animation I have ever seen, top-notch voice talent, sincere and honest messages, and a healthy dose of famed Disney magic, TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE (along with TINKER BELL and TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE) would have made a mint in the theatres. These movies make you believe, and really, that is all any of us want.Tinker Bell is back, and this time she and her friends are spending the summer on the human mainland. Tink is under strict orders to stay away from the humans. While fairies do a great many things for humans and the human world, rule number one is that humans do not know that fairies really exist. But the fairies never reckoned on a lonely little girl like Lizzy, before. You see, Lizzy LOVES fairies; she is one of the few humans who truly believes. Lizzy builds a fairy house, hoping upon hope to entice a fairy into being her friend (hmmm...sounds like someone else I know!). Well, guess who can't resist! Tink ends up befriending Lizzy and teaching her workaholic father lessons about trusting in his daughter and believing with his heart, instead of his head.TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is sweet, innocent, and stunning; a delightful tale told by outstanding talent. The brilliantly superb (I need more superlatives!) animation brings the fairies to life - they seem to fly out of the screen - and the voice actors are some of the very best in the business: Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, continues to be a perfect choice for Tink. Charming and sincere, she is conveys Tinker Bell perfectly. The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, Lucy Liu, Jessie McCartney, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the pleasure of this film. And, as in the previous two films, there is nothing particularly scary in TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE; nothing that will frighten or upset children. No one dies; no one is particularly evil; there is no bad language. From start to finish, TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE is cute, appealing, and captivating. I was grinning from ear to ear during the entire film, and my wee one sat peacefully on my lap throughout. In fact, she has already rapturously watched this movie five times. And mom hasn't minded a bit.Disney has a perfect hat trick with these three Tinker Bell movies, including TINKER BELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE, and a fourth one is on its way. Let's hope they can turn that hat trick into a grand slam home run. Neither my daughter nor I can wait for the next movie; we are already breathless with anticipation. In the mean time, though, I think we will go build a fairy house on the back porch. You never know who might come to visit. After all, all you have to do is believe. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I have read all three books in the His Dark Materials series by Philip Pullman, and I enjoyed the entire series. I also have read several articles on the making of The Golden Compass, so I was aware, very early on, that this film would end earlier than the book, and that the ending of THIS book would be the beginning of the NEXT movie. Therefore, I was not as disappointed in the end of this film as many others apparently were.IMHO, the casting of this film is dead on: Dakota Blue Richards shines as the very determined, single minded Lyra, Daniel Craig is very good as the slightly touched, windmill tilting Lord Asriel, Nicole Kidman is excellent as the true believer, yet evil Mrs. Coulter. The entire supporting cast does a fine job as well.The cinematography and the animation are both very well done. The settings are truly gorgeous. Live action and animation blend well, but do have noticeable differences. This contrast adds to the fantasy element of the film and helps to keep the viewer firmly entrenched in the world of the story.Out of necessity, this movie hits the ground running and keeps up a fast pace. The book is action-packed and filled with adventures; I imagine that there was much difficultly keeping the viewing time down to a reasonable length. That being said, an audience who had not read the book could have a hard time keeping up. I, at least, was able to fill in any gaps.I look forward to the next installment. I believe that you will like this film, especially if you are a fan of fantasy/adventure stories. I highly recommend it.

Let me say up front that I am not an audiophile. Unless something is really good or really bad, it pretty much all sounds the same to me. Additionally, I bought this recording of Fantasia to play on the little nursery CD player in my toddler's room. It does not have the greatest sound quality to begin with, but it suits my purpose, and my three year old can change her own CDs.WE LOVE FANTASIA. This is the only CD that my daughter will go to sleep to. She listens to it every night. She tells me the stories of the ice skating fairies, the dancing mushrooms, and the swimming fish. She recognizes excerpts from the Nutcracker Suite where ever she hears them. I hear her humming snatches of the various pieces. She also tells me the story of "Magic Mickey" (i.e., The Sorcerer's Apprentice) every night. She recognizes exactly what is going on by the various movements, and has only seen the Fantasia DVD twice. Clearly, she sees the pictures in her head. This is a very special time for us, courtesy of some very special music.Fantasia also brings back fond memories for me. I can remember seeing the movie with my parents, and later humming the tunes and watching the pictures in MY head. I think Fantasia gave me my love of classical music. It was one of the first cassette tapes that I kept in my car.This music nurtures the imagination of young and old alike. The sound quality is good enough for me - it sounds perfect to my ears. I give this CD my highest recommendation. It is a grand tradition that can be passed on to younger generations.

THE BEST OF POOH & HEFFALUMPS, TOO is a wonderful CD, full of some terrific memories. It has all of the original Winnie the Pooh classics songs, from The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers to Heffalumps And Woozles. It also contains Carly Simon's original Winnie the Pooh songs, written for some of the more modern movies, like Piglet's Big Movie and Pooh's Heffalump Movie.All the original, "great" songs remembered from childhood are here: Winnie the Pooh, Heffalumps And Woozles, The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers, Up, Down, and Touch the Ground, Rumbly In My Tumbly, and Little Black Rain Cloud. Carly Simon's new songs are equally memorable, and will one day be classics in their own right. New favorites include Little Mr. Roo (a very sweet, tender lullaby), and With A Few Good Friends. Carly Simon sounds simply wonderful. You can tell that this effort was a labor of love for her.My 3 year old enjoys this one very much. She knows all the words, and we sing them together. This CD is a good mix of upbeat, dreamy, and instrumental, and is very easy to snuggle up and fall asleep to. My daughter has even fallen asleep in the middle of singing! And so have I...

Helping Gifted Children Soar by Carol A. Strip and Gretchen Hirsch is an unparalleled tool for the parents and teachers of gifted children. Written in a clear, concise style, this book is a fairly easy and very informative read. Containing in-depth details on a wide range of topics including determining if your child is gifted as compared to smart; selecting appropriate teachers and schools; investigating various learning methods; recognizing the characteristics of good gifted programs; and communicating effectively with parents/teachers, this guide will teach you how to successfully advocate for your child in the public school system.Helping Gifted Child Soar walks you through the physical, social, intellectual, and emotional aspects of a gifted child. It is filled with real life examples and scenarios which illustrate the ups and downs of raising a gifted child. Unfortunately, gifted children are often ridiculed by others, because these children are frequently insecure and lacking in social skills. It is important to remember that gifted children have "special needs," and this book provides wonderful insight into the nurturing of those special needs and talents. It also contains a very valuable reference section, as well an informative question and answer section. A Spanish version is available:Ayudando a Los Ninos Dotados a Volar: Una Guia Practica Para Padres Y Maestros.I gave this book and its companion,A Love for Learning: Motivation and the Gifted Child, to my daughter's teachers. At two, she communicated beautifully with them, but had much obvious frustration talking to her peers. They simply could not understand her advanced verbal skills and interests. Additionally, if she didn't know a word for something, she would often create one of her own. These two books have been a boon for both her teachers and for her. She is much happier, and they are helping her to work at her own level and pace. Everyone is much happier.

I had heard wonderful things about THE GUITAR and how well it fared at Sundance. My husband and I also really enjoy Saffron Burrows, who is the star of this film. Sadly, the emperor is buck nekkid.THE GUITAR begins with Janine Garafalo telling Saffron Burrows (Melody) that she has throat cancer and will die in just a few weeks. Minutes later, Melody is fired and minutes after that, her boyfriend tells her he needs to explore his inner child. So Melody leaves her apartment forever, door open, keys on the floor, and rents a huge NYC penthouse loft. She proceeds to fill it with everything she could never afford but that her multitudinous credit cards allow her to have. And so we discover the source of the credit crunch! A good 15 minutes or so are all about her being naked after having thrown her clothes (and trash) out the window. She orders everything under the sun (except clothes) and when it arrives, she's still naked. Still naked when the pizza gets there. Don't worry; she ends up having sex with the married delivery man and the teenage pizza delivery girl. And then she has sex with them together.You could argue that all her sociopathic acts were just her going crazy with the knowledge of her upcoming demise, but the movie didn't really even hint at that. She was coldly calculating about it all.THE GUITAR movie has every, and I do mean every, clich&eacute; you can imagine if you've ever watch Lifetime Television. I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next, and I had to laugh each time I was right, no more so than we get to the "surprise" ending that I predicted exactly six minutes into the show. That is seldom a recommendation for a film.What are we to take from this movie? That when we're about to die, all bets are off? Melody even forgoes her vegetarianism and starts ordering meat-lovers pizza. I suppose we're meant to see how liberating her impending death is, how it frees her from societal constraints such as actually paying for what you buy, not having sex with minors, not having adulterous affairs, and being true to your own beliefs. Is this meant to uplift us? To help us cope with our own impending deaths? Ack! I hope not!But I'm forgetting something. THE GUITAR. That *is* the name of the movie, after all. We get flashbacks of Melody as a child, with her nose pressed against the glass of a music shop, dreaming about a Red-Ryder B-B gun - er, I mean a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Melody dreams about it every night, but it takes her until about 30 minutes into the film to actually buy one. As with everything else, she has no intention of paying for it. Eventually, she teaches herself to play and ... I can't tell you what happens after that. I can't even tell you what the director, Robert Redford's daughter, says is the point of the movie. That would ruin the "surprise" ending.There is a shadow of a descent movie here, and Saffron Burrows does her best with the material she has. If they had actually concentrated on the guitar, and Melody's learning how to play it, *that* would have been interesting. It could have achieved the director's stated goal. But alas, that was not to be.If you actually like movies on Lifetime, then you might really like THE GUITAR. Unfortunately, I'm one who has blocked Lifetime from my on-screen program guide. If only I had done that with this movie, too.

As a child, I loved HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON. I reconnected with this story when I became a mom, and received a copy from my aunt to share with my daughter. Even after all these years, the lessons of HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON are fresh and true. This is a classic that I am thrilled to be able to share with my wee one.Harold is gifted with a big, bold, and beautiful imagination. The drawings he creates with his favorite purple crayon take him wherever he wants to go, wherever he can dream. What a fantastic lesson for anyone. If you are looking for adventure, you need look no further than your imagination...and your trusty purple crayon.The illustrations for HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON are ingenious and very simple - basic line drawings, in the color purple. They look like the drawings of a young child, and the single color palate forces you to look at the details Harold is drawing, not the colors.My nearly 4 year old daughter loves hearing HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON at bedtime. It really sparks her imagination and gets her thinking and dreaming, and I can see the wheels turning as she falls a sleep. My little one has a very vivid imagination anyway; HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON just reminds her that her imagination is all she really needs. Along, of course, with her purple crayon.

I have seen many incarnations of Sweeny Todd on stage. I am originally from LA, and frequently had a friend in a production somewhere. Let me say up front, that I do not like this play/musical. I never have. The blood and violence have always seemed an unappealing subject for a musical, especially in juxtaposition to Sondheim's wonderful score. However, my not liking the subject matter does NOT preclude me from recognizing and enjoying an outstanding production and an amazing performance.I am not certain that anyone other than Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could have pulled off this masterpiece. Tim Burton was an inspired choice as director; unique and quirky enough to bring Sondheim's bizarre vision to the big screen. The cinematography was perfect: the mood, color pallet, camera angles, and editing all adding to the brilliance. The color choice for and "performance" of the blood actually made the blood itself another character in the story.When I first heard of Johnny Depp's selection to play Sweeny Todd, my initial reaction was "Really?," and then, "Maybe..." Johnny Depp's performance is truly outstanding. This film raises his acting credentials to a whole new level. Depp owns this role, playing it will the prefect combination of drama, comedy, and, yes, just a touch of camp. The emotions are real, deep, and believed; Depp commits 300% to the character. And guess what? He can sing. I admit to being shocked by that. His voice is very appropriate to the character and pleasant to listen to. Is it a big, Broadway voice? No. But what it lacks in power, he certainly surpasses in pathos. The interpretation and emotion of the songs are a true revelation to the depths of Depp's talent.The rest of the cast simply strengthens this production even further. Allan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helena Bonham Carter, even an extremely brief appearance by Anthony Stewart Head, as well as host of others, all add talent, depth, and excellence.These actors and this director truly do justice to this strange and odd musical. The film did not disappoint; I was actually riveted. IMHO, this is one of the best movies of the year and a truly inspired performance by Johnny Depp. If you like Sondheim, Burton, Depp, musicals, or even blood and gore, I highly recommend this amazing film.

MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a sweet, appealing way to spend a lazy afternoon. Set in London at the onset of WWII, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY tells the story of two very different women whose paths cross briefly, making a huge impact in each other lives. This film leaves you feeling happy, with a big smile on your face.Amy Adams and Frances McDormand are perfect foils for each other. Amy Adams plays the young, carefree, morally questionable, gorgeous young starlet (Delysia Lafosse); Frances McDormand is the plain, unassuming daughter of a clergyman, who makes a rather unsuccessful living as a governess (Miss Pettigrew). Miss Pettigrew has just been fired from another job, and Delysia finds herself in multiple romantic entanglements. The two women find each other, and each makes a big difference in the life of the other. Delysia Lafosse learns what she wants most in her heart, and Miss Pettigrew learns to live. In the end, both get everything that they deserve.The performances from the entire cast are very pleasing, each person playing their somewhat stereotypical characters to a tee. The costuming is perfect for the period and simply lovely; I really enjoyed all the clothes in this one. The cinematography is muted and soft, working very nicely for the time period portrayed. Overall, this is a very well done film.A cross between Cinderella and Pygmalion, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY is a thoroughly enjoyable film, a charmer for the whole family. A real life fairy tale that leaves you contented and satisfied, everyone lives happily ever after. Which is exactly what you want.

SKY HIGH is a Disney movie about a high school, SKY HIGH, for the children of superheroes. Here, they study to be either a) superheroes or b) sidekicks (aka Hero Support). As with any high school, there are social cliques, raging hormones, and impossible homework, but SKY HIGH takes it all to a whole new level.It is the first day of high school at SKY HIGH for freshman Will Stronghold, son of superhero power couple The Commander and Jetstream. Unfortunately for Will, he is a bit delayed and has not yet developed his powers. He washes out at "power classification" and is shunted off to the sidekick track. To make matters worse, he learns that, in very rare cases, the offspring of two superheroes may never develop powers. Will makes the best of his situation, but is very worried about disappointing his top of the heap parents. And of course, there is evil lurking about, and it seems to be targeting Will's family. Will Will get his powers in time? Will he get them at all? Will he be able to save his family and the world? Tune in to SKY HIGH to find out.Is SKY HIGH predictable, campy, and clich&eacute;? YES! Did I know exactly what was going to happen from the very beginning? YES! Was it immediately obvious who the real heroes and who the villains were? YES! Did I care? NO! NO! NO! SKY HIGH is cute, sweet, and perfect for families. There is no bad language, no sexual innuendo, no gore, and nothing more than mild comic book violence. Just plain, good, clean fun. I, personally, found myself grinning throughout most of this film, enjoying the sheer cuteness of it.The entire cast does a nice, campy, over the top job of it (hey, they ARE superheroes and super villains, after all), but I especially enjoyed the appearances of Lynda Carter, Cloris Leachman, and Bruce Campbell. The story is typical Disney, with a happy ending and good messages. SKY HIGH teaches kids to be true to themselves, true to their friends, and true to what they believe, all wrapped up in a live action comic book. SKY HIGH is an easy, breezy, light-hearted summer flick, perfect for the entire family.

What's not to like about this pan? We've owned it for more than five years and given them as gifts to family members. Strangely, we've made precious few crepes. We mostly cook eggs in it. When we have the neighbors over for Sunday brunch, they ooh and ahh about the perfection of the omelets but we defer to this pan. It's the right tool for the job. It's light enough to let you flip flap jacks and just the right size for a fish filet or two. We do occasionally put it in the dishwasher (more often that I'd like to admit) with no discernable ill effects. Even so, we use it so much that we usually do wash it by hand.As an indication of this pan's prominence in our kitchen, it is one of two that is not put away in the cabinet. The other is the Lodge 12-inch cast iron skillet.

My four year old daughter potty-trained herself, in about a week, right before she turned three years old. After that first week, she never had another accident, and she never once wet the bed. So, recently, when she had a couple of night-time accidents, I went looking for answers. It turns out that she is going through what a lot of kids go through: her body has grown faster than her bladder and, occasionally, it just can't keep up with her. She has been pretty calm about it; I told her that is was normal and that it happens to a lot of kids, and she has taken me at my word, which is great. She is a terrific, well adjusted kid.But I did want to do something to protect her mattress and save mommy from nocturnal bed changes. After reading lots of reviews, I purchased two of these BLUE MAX REUSABLE WATERPROOF BED PADS, and they are the perfect solution. First, these REUSABLE WATERPROOF BED PADS are large 34" x 36", and easily cover the area of the bed on which her bottom rests, as well as covering all the needed extra wiggle room. They are super soft, so that you can put them on top of the sheets, if you want to, and then just change the pad and not the sheets. And they are fabulously absorbent. I am always surprised by how much liquid such a tiny person can hold, but these pads can hold it all, and at the same time, they wick the moisture away from her, keeping her little body dry.As I said, I purchased two of these BLUE MAX BED PADS, and use an old trick to protect my daughter's privacy. I lay one pad on the mattress, and put a fitted sheet over it. Then I place the second pad on the top of the sheet, and place another fitted sheet over the top of the second pad. This way, if there is an accident, mommy can just remove the wet sheet and the wet pad, and put the little one back to bed. There is a nice dry sheet for my daughter, and minimum sleep disruption for me. In the morning, I just throw the sheet and the BLUE MAX BED PAD in the washer, and put the clean pad and sheet back on top of the bad. No muss, no fuss, and a happy, dry, sleeping child.I think this will be a short phase, and we won't need these BLUE MAX REUSABLE WATERPROOF BED PADS for very long, but for now, they are saving our sleep, the mattress, and my daughter's dignity.

THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON, and sadly, the only season, are based on the novels by Jim Butcher. I love Jim Butcher's novels and Harry Dresden. While not an exact adaptation of Butcher's well-beloved series, THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON are still a lot of fun and well worth watching.I have always thought of this series as a kind of Harry Potter meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Charmed meets X-Files meets Sam Spade. And somehow, that weird and wonderful combination just works. These shows have great atmosphere. The cinematography is clearly inspired by 1940s film noire. The colors are just muted enough to send you back in time to that era. The acting is great. Paul Blackthorne is an inspired choice to play our favorite wizard, Harry. Rough around the edges, sarcastic humor, tongue-in-cheek wit, world-weary voice, always fighting for the underdog, Blackthorne captures Harry to a tee. Now, whenever I read the books, I hear Blackthorne's voice in my head. That is a good thing. Terrence Mann is first-rate as Bob, the skull in Harry's basement. Mann is another excellent choice, as put upon and droll as Butcher wrote. But here, Bob's spirit can manifest outside of the skull, which is good for us. We get to really see the interactions and the bond between Harry and Bob. This is a definite plus, dare I say an improvement from the books. Something like an animated skull would not have worked nearly as well. The rest of the cast are equally good, committed to their roles and to the series. They make it all work, and add to the audience's enjoyment of these shows.The plots are loosely based on different excerpts from various early Dresden books. They are a little less dark, a little less gruesome, and a lot simpler, but still captivating mystery stories, enthralling detective stories, and entertaining supernatural stories. All rolled into one. This series is definitely a keeper. To bad Sci Fi didn't think so. Perhaps THE DRESDEN FILES - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON are destined to become a cult classic.

We recently revisited this old friend, and HARVEY is one film that surely stands the test of time. This is Jimmy Stewart at his best: sweet, polite, and happy. HARVEY is an excellent choice for a lazy Sunday morning with the entire family.Elwood P. Dowd has an imaginary friend, whose name is HARVEY. HARVEY is an invisible, 6 foot tall, white rabbit, who accompanies Elwood everywhere. Ever polite, Elwood introduces HARVEY to everyone he meets. However, since only Elwood can see HARVEY, most folks think that Elwood is crazy.But is Elwood crazy? That question is left for the audience to ponder. The fact is that it doesn't really matter if Elwood is crazy. Elwood is kind, polite, pleasant, and always has a good time right where he is. It just doesn't matter if he has a giant, talking, white rabbit for a best friend or not.The story of HARVEY is delightful and engaging. Jimmy Stewart is at his very best as Elwood. The rest of the supporting cast is outstanding, including Josephine Hull who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Elwood's sister. Of course, HARVEY is excellent as himself. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous! The play of light and shadow gives this movie a calm, dreamy quality that could not ever be duplicated in color.On my DVD, Jimmy Stewart gives a marvelous, sentimental introduction to HARVEY. As part of the introduction, Mr. Stewart said that people still stop him on the streets and ask if HARVEY is there with him. At first, he thought people were pulling his leg. But he soon came to realize that folks were serious. They wanted to meet HARVEY and give him their regards. It seems that many people a have friend like HARVEY that they talk to about their problems, and they wanted to let HARVEY know that they believe in him. This charming story brought a tear to my eye. The world would probably be a much better place if there were more HARVEYs and more Elwood P. Dowds in it.

This incarnation of SHERLOCK HOLMES should be an excellent movie. I enjoy all the actors, and most of the acting is very good. They characters they portray are engaging and have nice chemistry. The plot is decent, if a little worn. The costumes are lovely and the recreation of 19th century London is outstanding. Even the score is very nice. Taken individually each of these elements appears to succeed. So why is SHERLOCK HOLMES so much less than the sum of its parts?In my opinion, the cinematography, the writing, and the direction bring SHERLOCK HOLMES down. The cinematography is dark and dim; the sun never shines. At times, it is hard to see what is going on. The perpetual storm over London stops any of the lovely costumes from popping. Basically, SHERLOCK HOLMES is boring to look at. The writing doesn't help either. While the plot is entertaining, it is similar to many recent plots, including Dan Brown's current novel or one of The Librarian movies. Not really worthy of SHERLOCK HOLMES. Lastly, the direction really fails SHERLOCK HOLMES. The film lacks suspense where it should be brimming with it. It is a very one dimensional film, devoid of depth and substance, completely superficial. The audience is never enveloped by the story. And for some reason, the director allows Robert Downey, Jr. to mumble throughout. RDJ is a better actor than that.I really wanted to like SHERLOCK HOLMES, but the misdirection and lack of execution left me with a very lukewarm impression overall. It was very nice to see this SHERLOCK HOLMES hearken back to its roots in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (and not the old Basil Rathbone films), but it just wasn't enough to get me excited. And I wanted to be excited. I hear that a second film is in the works. I will probably see it, but with a little trepidation. Let's hope that they can make the necessary improvements to make the next SHERLOCK HOLMES the outstanding movie that it should be.

I have been a huge Stargate fan since the beginning. When the series ended it felt incomplete. The current story arc was not finished. This movie did what it needed to do: it put a satisfying bow on the package.This extended episode has all the elements that made Stargate a phenomenal series. As always, the writing and dialogue are excellent, the characters have fun and interact well, the sets and effects are what we have come to expect, the plot was fast paced and interesting, and there were balanced amounts of humor and tension and of action and science. The musical underscoring was superb. It added to the story, and was delightful to listen to. And of course, good triumphs over evil, and our heroes ride off to their next adventure, hinting at even more to come.There are only two minor issues with The Ark of Truth. 1. No Jack. I really like the new SG-1, but I miss Jack. 2. As stated earlier, the movie completes the Ori story arc, but it did no more. It had all the excellent elements of the series, but no more. As a movie, I would have expected them to go farther than they would in an episode, to be even bigger and better.Overall, I was not disappointed, as I had been with the "last" episode. Every fan of Stargate will love Ark of Truth.

Time again for another comic-to-movie disaster. This one is SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, and it's so bad that it's in Airbender territory.First, let me tell you the premise of SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. For me to do this is a great kindness since you have to wait more than half an hour for the movie to hint at it and almost a full hour to get a fuller description. Even then, you have to wait until the very end to be told why any of it is happening at all. But to the point - Scott Pilgrim has fallen for a girl, but to be with her, he has to fight seven of her previous boy/girl friends in real life parodies of arcade parodies of movie parodies of real life martial arts duels. Need I say more? I struggled through the mind-numbing tedium with my tween-aged daughter who had wanted to see this flick. But after the first hour, even she wanted me to hit the FF button.The performances in SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD are all okay, except for Johnny One-Note Michael Cera. He plays the same character in every movie and I'm bored with it. It's not like he's Sean Connery, who can get away with it. Worse, he reminds me here of Aaron Johnson's character in Kick-Ass. Ack! Now I'm comparing those two movies. Double Ack! They're both really bad! Ahhh!!! My brain!Wow. That was close. I did trip on over to Rotten Tomatoes to see what the consensus over there was, and I was stunned to find that a great majority of reviewers and normal folks liked SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD. So what am I missing? It's got good production values, the music is fine for what it is, and the actors can act (mostly), but I expect all of that from any movie. The plot is ethereal and meandering, and most of the characters are one-dimensional. But the worse sin of all is that it is boring. How do you recover from that? For me, SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is a KO and down for the count.

To Say Nothing of the Dog is an extremely entertaining and very fun read. This book is an odd hybrid - a cross between hard (time travel) sci-fi, historical (or should I say, hysterical) fiction, and good, old fashioned mystery. It is classic time travel verses paradox book. It is a laugh-out-loud comedic romp through the Victorian era, with an extensive collection of literary allusions. (Most are recognizable; a few you need to look up. But I like that in a book - when it makes me go learn something.) It is also a traditional "whodunit" mystery...with the traditional culprit, of course!Connie Willis has created a true treasure. Fast paced and full of laughter, the plot is top-notch; the characters are well developed, memorable, and extremely enjoyable; the writing is crisp and clever. To Say Nothing of the Dog is a page turner from beginning to end. I could not put it down.I first heard of this book on an Amazon forum where the participants were discussing sci-fi favorites that they re-read for comfort and pleasure. This book appeared on numerous lists, so I felt I had to give it a try. I am so glad I did. It has become an instant favorite. One I KNOW I will re-read again and again.

At 12 inches across, this skillet is big! And being cast iron, it's also heavy. Add to that the matching cover and it really does take two hands to handle this whopper! Note the extra handle on the front of the beast. It's there for a reason. It makes the skillet manageable despite the weight.The second item to note is that this skillet is not dishwasher-safe. It requires special attention. That's not unique in the world of cookware, but this one requires a little babying. I've found that the extra effort is minimal and not as mysterious as some of the reviews here have made it out to be. In short, just follow the manufacturer's guidelines. They're from people who know this product and they're straight-forward.So with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that we love this skillet! We have cooked plenty of items in it and use it several times a week. Fried chicken, steaks, chuck roasts, you name it.For steaks, just crank up the heat to max, (we have a gas stove, so electric might be different), put a little oil, salt, and pepper on the steaks, and put them in for 3 minutes uncovered. Then flip and leave for 3 minutes. Then flip, turn off the heat, and cover for 3 minutes. Then flip and cover for 3 more minutes. That's it. It's all in the skillet and it comes out perfect. (adjust times for thickness of steak.) The thickness of the cast iron lets the skillet retain the heat and distribute it. With the lid on, it acts as a Dutch oven.For roasts, we start the same way, but searing the roast for 6 minutes in what Alton Brown calls a "rocket-hot" skillet. 3 minutes on each side, then cover it and slide it into an oven set on BROIL. Leave it there for 5 minutes/pound. (a 2-pound roast = 10 minutes.) Then turn off the oven and leave the roast for about an hour. DON'T OPEN THE DOOR! Simple and delicious.About the only thing we don't cook in this skillet is eggs. They do tend to stick. I have to think we're doing something wrong since my in-laws cook eggs in theirs with no problems. Of course, they've had theirs since Lincoln was a toddler, and these skillets do seem to age very well, as long as you take care of them.Bottom line: If you don't mind the heft and the extra bit of maintenance, this skillet will serve you well for years. And if you have kids you can inspire in the kitchen, this could become one of your treasured family heirlooms.

THE KING'S SPEECH is many things. It is the story of a man who never wanted to be king. It is the story of a man who must overcome a debilitating condition. It is also a story of an unbreakable friendship and belief in yourself. THE KING'S SPEECH is my choice for Best Picture of the Year.Prince Albert was never supposed to become the king of England. He was content being a naval officer and a husband. But when his father, King George V, died and his flamboyant brother, King Edward, scandalously abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallace Simpson, "Bertie," as he was known to his family, suddenly found himself thrust on the throne and into the lime light... just when England was on the brink of war and needed a strong king the most. You see, Bertie had an almost incapacitating stutter; he could barely make himself understood, especially during public speeches. But his loving wife, Queen Elizabeth (who became the Queen Mother), never gave up hope or her belief in her husband, and eventually introduced him to Lionel Logue, an out of work Australian actor who had some unconventional, yet successful, methods that helped many people overcome their stutters. Along the way, a very extraordinary friendship is formed, hardships are overcome, and a true king is made.THE KING'S SPEECH is a remarkable film, full of warmth, sentiment, and heart. Then entire cast is outstanding, most especially Colin Firth as King George VI, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, and Michael Gambon as King George V. This entire ensemble deserves the highest accolades, including Timothy Spall in a cameo as Winston Churchill. The chemistry is wonderful, the atmosphere is real and believable, the cinematography is era-perfect, and the story is heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time. You will laugh, cry, and care; and these are the things the best films should do.I really didn't know what to expect when I saw THE KING'S SPEECH, but I am so very glad my husband talked me into it. It is simply wonderful, not to be missed. And, I hope, the 2011 Oscar Winner!

We never really wonder where all the little niceties of life come from - the three way light bulb, the tv remote, the automatic thermostat, or the ice maker, just to name a few. These devices make our days easier, with little to no fanfare. We are so used to such conveniences that we never see them, and we certainly never think about them. This film, FLASH OF GENIUS, is the story of the man who invented one such convenience device, the intermittent windshield wiper. Do you even remember a time before we had them? I don't; I mean, not really. Oh, I do know that there were invented in my lifetime, but I certainly don't think about them or really remember when they came into being. But now, I expect every car on the road to have them.The intermittent windshield wiper was invented by Robert Kearns, a college professor and regular family man with a lovely wife and a passel of kids. FLASH OF GENIUS is his story. His life is completely changed when he invents the mechanism that allows drivers to control the interval between the "blinking" of the blades on a windshield wiper. Dr. Kearns patents his invention and takes it to the Ford Motor Company. Ford is VERY interested (Bob Kearns has done what all the Ford engineers have failed to do) but in the end, they refuse to give him a contract. When Dr. Kearns later learns that Ford has installed the intermittent wipers on their cars, he takes the Ford Motor Company to court for patent infringement, but finds that he is David to their Goliath. They drag out his case nearly 30 years. Bob ends up in a psychiatric hospital, with no family, few friends, and nothing to show for his ingenuity. In the end, Bob does triumph. But was it worth the horrible price?As I said earlier, FLASH OF GENIUS is a very difficult movie to watch. You ache for this man, as Ford beats him down over and over again. Their treatment of him is detestable and painful to watch as he loses more and more of his life, and it is a testament to Robert Kearns' internal strength and perseverance that he keeps trying.Greg Kinnear gives the performance of a lifetime as Robert Kearns. Kinnear makes this bumbling, awkward, nave professor sympathetic and real. The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job, but this is Kinnear's movie. Even a superbly acted appearance by Alan Alda does nothing to lessen the focus on Kinnear's character.FLASH OF GENIUS unfolds quite slowly, quietly reeling the viewer in. You become emotionally invested in the story. I can't say I "enjoyed" this film, but I certainly found it worth watching. I learned a thing or two, which is one of the main reasons, IMHO, to watch a movie in the first place. And I must say that I will never look at my windshield wipers, the Ford Motor Company, or unsung inventors the same way ever again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

TANGLED, the latest animated film by those clever Disney folks, is an updated take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. I had the pleasure of seeing this over Christmas with four kids - 3 girls and a boy, ages 13, 10, 7, and 5 - as well as my still single bother-in-law. And, everyone in this very diverse group had a wonderful time.TANGLED follows the storyline of the Rapunzel fairy tale, so I won't retell it here. However, Disney has added humor, music, and enough surprises to turn TANGLED into an delighful, modern story for the 21st century. Like Tiana from The Princess and The Frog, Rapunzel is not your typical, faint of heart princess; when an intruder breaches her tower, she handily whacks him with a cast iron skillet and makes him her prisoner. She boldly goes after her destiny and discovers who she really is. As much as I like Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, these new Disney princesses go after what they want, work hard, and, (with help from friends) succeed. And along the way, they and the "prince" end up helping each other. These are the role models I want for my kids!The animation in TANGLED is gorgeous, the music (Alan Menken!!!) is outstanding and catchy, and the voice acting is excellent. Mandy Moore is on point as the spunky, strong willed Rapunzel, and she sings beautifully as well. Donna Murphy (as the wicked witch) and Zachary Levi (as the roguish intruder) both turn in fine voice and singing performances as well. The animal characters, Maximus, the intrepid war horse, and Pascal, the Jiminy Cricket-like chameleon, don't talk (for once!), but they convey more in expressions and actions than many human characters. A lot of the LOL funny moments (and there are MANY in TANGLED) occur with these two, and they alone are worth the price of admission.Overall, TANGLED is charming, entertaining, and funny - a treat for the entire family. And I really love these 21st century Disney princesses; they are strong, independent, hardworking, kind, and loving. Exactly the kind of young women that I hope for my daughters to be.

I did not expect to like THE WRESTLER. But this movie really surprised me. Once you get pasted the endless punishment these men force on themselves in the ring, the brutal things they do to their bodies over and over again, there is a story told in THE WRESTLER that is definitely worth watching.THE WRESTLER tells the tale of a professional wrestler, Randy "The Ram" Robinson, very late in his career. Wrestling is all this man knows, and 20 years after the fight of his life, he is still following the trail, picking up second-rate matches where ever he can, living paycheck to paycheck. But then he has a major heart attack. He decides to give up wrestling, hook up with a stripper for whom he genuinely cares, and mend his relationship with his daughter. None of this works. Wrestling is all he knows, and so he decides to go back into the ring, the only place where he feels truly appreciated and respected.Mickey Rourke does an admirable job as Randy the Ram, especially when you realize that he does all of his own stunts. You genuinely come to like this character, and it is very easy to connect with him. Rourke is dead on in his portrayal of a man whose professional image inside the ring is pure violence, but outside the ring, he is a gentle, kind person just trying to survive. Marisa Tomei is quite good as the aging stripper, who has feelings for The Ram, but is not quite ready to admit to them.THE WRESTLER will give you a shocking look into the world of professional wrestling, and quite frankly is not for the squeamish. The overall pacing is rather slow, and you have to be willing to just allow the story to unfold in its own manner.

BOLT, the latest Disney animated offering, is very cute and very fun. A story about a little girl and her beloved dog, BOLT is a terrific film for the entire family. My three year old daughter fell in love with the characters; she now wants a little white dog, named BOLT. My husband and I both enjoyed the film; there are many places were we laughed out loud.In BOLT, Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) and BOLT (voiced by John Travolta) are on their own, saving the world and each other from countless disasters. Penny's father has been kidnapped by the arch-villian Dr. Calico (voiced by Malcolm McDowell). But before he disappeared, Penny's father altered BOLT, and turned him into a canine superhero with laser vision, super speed, and the ultimate bark. But what BOLT doesn't know is that his whole life is a TV series, and that truth has been carefully hidden from him. He truly believes he has superpowers. One day, however, after an episode where Dr. Calico captures Penny, BOLT accidentally gets loose in the real world. He is shocked when his superpowers suddenly fail him, but becomes convinced that pink Styrofoam packing peanuts have the power to weaken him. Eventually, however, he realizes the truth, and with the help of an alley cat named Mittens and a crazy hamster named Rhino, he discovers who he truly is, as he makes his way back home to Penny. In the end, BOLT becomes a true hero, and saves the life of the one he loves the most.As I stated above, BOLT is a very entertaining film, perfect for the entire family. It is funny, adorable, and well cast. Miley Cyrus is wonderful as Penny. John Travolta is always a plus. The rest of the cast is equally good, all working well together. The animation is gorgeous, extremely realistic, and quite amazing. Kids like it, and adults like it.So why not five stars? You would think that a Disney movie about a cute little girl and her adorable pup would be a slam dunk five stars. Well, it is close, but it just isn't quite "there." I wanted to see/hear more of Miley Cyrus, who does an outstanding job as Penny. John Travolta, whom I love and who has created many memorable characters, needed MORE character as BOLT. His voice was pleasant, and there was nothing wrong with his performance; it just didn't grab me the way his characters normally do. Additionally, I think the writers let the audience down. There is not a lot of "pop" in this script; perhaps it is just a bit bland. The writers also lost sight of the target audience. While BOLT is charming in most ways, too much of the comedy goes over kids' heads. Adults may laugh out loud, but the kids are left puzzled. While this happens in many kid films, it is usually more subtle and happens less frequently than it did here. The script simply tries to be too many things to too many people.Don't get me wrong, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOLT, especially for an evening of family entertainment. This film is very appealing and quite charming. It just could have been a little bit more.

BEAR STAYS UP FOR CHRISTMAS by Karma Wilson is a completely adorable, simply delightful children's Christmas story. This is my first introduction to the Bear books, and I sincerely hope it will not be my last. I cannot wait to share this with my wee one.Bear has never been awake at Christmas. He is always hibernating for the winter. This year, Bear's friends are determined that he will celebrate Christmas with them. They wake him up on Christmas Eve, and participate in all sorts of traditional Christmas activities to keep him awake. Bear is having a really great time, but eventually all his friends doze off. But Bear stays up and enjoys the special night. When everyone awakes on Christmas morning, there are lots of Christmas surprises for everyone, including Bear. At the end of the holiday, Bear finally goes back to sleep, with fantastic memories of his special day.Told in wonderful rhyming verse, almost reminiscent of the rhythm of `TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, this clever, sweet, endearing story definitely appeals to young and old alike. Jane Chapman's illustrations are pretty, colorful, detailed, cute, and fun. I was completely captivated from start to finish.I know my young daughter will love this book. I am so tempted to share it with her now. But I am also determined to wait until Christmas. I think it will be a wonderful Christmas Eve surprise, and predict that BEAR STAYS UP FOR CHRISTMAS will become a tradition in our household.

I was 10 years old in the spring of 1973, and I remember watching each leg of that year's Triple Crown with heart-pounding breathlessness. My mother and I always watched the Triple Crown together; she is, was, and will always be a horse person. But 1973 was special; even a 10 year old could tell that. That big, beautiful red horse. His distinct personality and clear intelligence. And his absolute love of running and his will to win. SECRETARIAT was clearly a very special horse. The horse of a lifetime, the champion of a century.This beautiful movie, SECRETARIAT, is the story of that magnificent red horse, and the very special people who knew him. His owner, Penny Chenery, who knew he was special from the moment he was born; his trainer, Lucien Laurin, who just couldn't stay away; his jockey, Ronnie Turcotte, who knew how to let him run his race; his groom, Eddie Sweat, who knew what the horse was thinking; and wonderful Miss Ham, who took care of them all. SECRETARIAT was born a champion, and these people believed in him from the very start, even when the rest of the racing world was against them.SECRETARIAT is a stellar film, with an incredible story, an outstanding ensemble cast, gorgeous cinematography, and perfect chemistry, between both people and horses. The racing scenes are amazing; I was on my feet cheering wildly for "Big Red," as he was known. I felt 10 years old again, magically transported back to that very special spring. My heart pounded during every race, even though I knew every historic outcome. And that final race, The Belmont, which set records that have yet to be broken, the race that this horse shouldn't have, couldn't have won, but oh so clearly did, and with such style and aplomb, is truly magnificent and left me in tears.My husband and I truly loved SECRETARIAT; this film is now at the top of our list of all time favorites. SECRETARIAT is the perfect film for families, sports fans, horse lovers, and, well, just about everyone! Exciting and sentimental, beautiful and captivating, inspiring and heart-warming, SECRETARIAT should not be missed. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I am thrilled that MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION: THE COMPLETE SERIES is now available on DVD. I am very thrilled that I now own it. I am even more thrilled that this anthology contains two never before seen episodes.I first became aware of MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION during the summer of 2007. While flipping through the channels, the installment titled "Jerry Was A Man" caught my eye on ABC. "Jerry Was A Man" is a short story by Robert Heinlein, one of my favorite authors. I knew almost immediately what I was seeing and was both stunned and very excited. Upon investigation, I learned what we now all know: MASTERS OF SCIENCE FICTION brings to life the work of six of the world's greatest sci fi authors. Each episode is based on a well know short story: "Jerry Was A Man" by Robert Heinlein, "The Discarded" by Harlan Ellison, "A Clean Escape" by John Kessel, "The Awakening" by Howard Fast, "Watchbird" by Robert Sheckley, and "Little Brother" by Walter Mosley. Each story is directed by a talented director, such as Jonathan Frakes, Harold Becker, or Mark Rydell. Each installment also includes a star-studded cast - Anne Heche, Malcolm McDowell, Elizabeth Rohm, Sam Waterston, John Hurt, Sean Astin, and Brian Dennehy, to name a few. The production values are outstanding, and famed professor Stephen Hawking hosts the entire series in a manner similar to that of Twilight Zone's Rod Serling. I only caught three of the four episodes aired at the time, searching in vain for the remainder in reruns. For what ever reasons, this series received almost no marketing and was never rerun. So you can understand my elation at discovering these DVDs.This is good, old fashion science fiction at its best, based on strong, intelligent "future history stories" by some of the best authors in the business. These stories are not necessarily easy. The authors' intent is to make you think. Classic and classy, these stories have stood the test of time. And it is about time that someone brought them to television, to a hopefully wider audience. And it makes you wonder what took them so long.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone, but most especially for lovers of classic science fiction.

If you have not yet seen THE BLIND SIDE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do. THE BLIND SIDE is sweet, compelling, emotional, and thoroughly enjoyable. It is the perfect movie for a warm, cozy evening at home.THE BLIND SIDE is the true story of a homeless teenager Michael Oher, and the family that unconditionally takes him in. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael walking the streets late one cold night, and invites him into her home. Somehow they need each other, and Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family. As Michael improves his grades and learns about football, they all learn about the meaning of love, life, family, and support. THE BLIND SIDE will make you laugh, make you cry, and give you hope. It truly is a feel good movie.Sandra Bullock is excellent (and lovely) as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a strong, spunky woman with a huge heart, Tim McGraw as her amiable, likeable husband, and Quinton Aaron steals the show as the teenager who is so much more than he seems. Kate Bates does a nice turn as Michael's tutor, encouraging him to do better, haranguing him when he doesn't try. The chemistry of the entire cast is outstanding and quite believable. The love of this family for each other radiates off the screen and makes you feel happy. As an added bit of reality, a number of well-know NCAA college football coaches make cameo appearances as themselves.The script for THE BLIND SIDE is exceptional. Even as life is getting better for Michael, you never forget where he came from and how hard he had to work. You ache for this boy and horror of his childhood, and you cheer for this family and what they have done for each other. The writers and the actors take you on a joyous emotional rollercoaster, from the tragic depths to the highest heights. And the destination is most definitely worth the ride.So grab a bag of popcorn, a box of tissues, and a cuddly blanket. Then pop in this movie and enjoy. THE BLIND SIDE is a movie that you will be thinking about for days. It is still making me smile.

Reading really is magic. The words and illustrations of a really good book transport us to other worlds, other time periods, other dimensions. And a really excellent teacher will get children excited about reading and make them yearn for the written word. MISS SMITH'S INCREDIBLE STORYBOOK, by Michael Garland, is one of those very magical stories that really appeal to children and make them want to read more.In MISS SMITH'S INCREDIBLE STORYBOOK, Miss Smith is the new teacher, and she makes both reading and school cool. She has bright orange, punked out hair, wears red Converse high tops, and a black leather jacket with buttons of cool rock bands on the collar. And when she reads to the class from her storybook, the stories come to life...literally. Zack and the rest of his classmates suddenly find themselves on the deck of a pirate ship or in the woods with Little Red Ridinghood. At the end of each story, the characters and the locations pop back into the book. Zack and his friends are very excited about class and about reading. One day, however, Miss Smith is late for class, and Principal Rittenrotten (gotta love that name!) begins to read from Miss Smith's book. Suddenly, the storybook characters are out of control! Can Miss Smith get them all back safely in the book?MISS SMITH'S INCREDIBLE STORYBOOK is pure delight. I bough it as a Christmas present for my 3 and year old on the recommendation of a friend, and my wee one just loves it (I do, too!). The story is simple and clearly told. She follows it without out any problems and just loves looking at the vibrant, colorful drawings. She easily identifies the characters from other familiar stories, and finds the entire dilemma in the book to be hilarious.MISS SMITH'S INCREDIBLE STORYBOOK is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for preschoolers through about 3rd/4th grade. The pre-readers will love listening to this enchanting story, and the young readers will love reading it for themselves. It is a book that will last through multiple phases in a reader's life, and that makes it even more magical.

Disney did this one right. Enchanted is fun-filled family entertainment for children of all ages. This is a new take on an old fairy tale, where the real world and the animated world collide in, you guessed it, New York City.This story is Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty and the Beast all rolled into one. Think hidden cottage in the woods with woodland friends, a heroic rescue, an evil stepmother, a handsome prince, a glass slipper, an old hag, a wishing well, a poisoned apple, a grand waltz, true love's first kiss - you name it, Enchanted has it. And it all works.The live action characters are all comfortable and enjoyable in their roles. Amy Adams is a delight as the beautiful, sweet natured princess, and Susan Sarandon is brilliant as the wicked stepmother. McDreamy and James Marsden are both very entertaining in their respective roles. A surprise pleasure is the evil henchman, played by Timothy Spall, fresh from his role as Wormtail in the Harry Potter films. As these real-life animated characters break into song in the middle of Central Park, you find yourself with a smile on your face and a toe tapping foot. I think I grinned throughout the entire film.At the start of the film, our princess is living in her small hidden cottage in the woods, where every morning she calls the woodland creatures to help her get dressed and clean up. On her first morning in NYC, she does the same thing. Now just imagine what sort of "creatures" come to her from the depths of New York City. I will not spoil it for the viewer, but it is the most cringe-worthy, yet highly entertaining scene in the entire movie.Any fan of fairytales and/or Disney will love this film. It is light, fluffy, well done fun. I highly recommend it.

MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM is a very sweet, romantic film. My husband and I spent a quiet evening at home watching this one, and we both really enjoyed it. While the plot is familiar and predictable, it is still very well done, and exactly what you want this kind of movie to be.In MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM, we first meet 5 year old Danny as he helps to deliver the baby of his recently deceased mother's best friend. After baby Anna makes her unique arrival into the world, young Danny declares that he will marry her someday. Soon after this momentous event, however, Danny and his father move back to England. Jump forward 25 years, and we meet Danny again, newly returned to the USA. He thinks he is going to move in with his girlfriend, but she does not have the same idea. In fact, she is leaving town to be with someone else. Fate then does a little happy dance, and Danny ends up living above a bakery, with a job as a delivery boy, delivering a cake to the family of his mother's best friend, where he runs in to baby Anna, all grown up now. She is lovely and sweet, and of course, engaged to someone else. Danny immediately falls in love with her, and delivers that classic pick up line, "Wow, the last time I saw you, you were covered in after-birth." Anna does not think much of Danny, at first, but over time, he grows on her. Will fate intervene again? Will Danny and Anna fulfill their destiny?MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM is charming, fun, and innocent. Jude Law is young and handsome, and just right for the role of Danny. Gretchen Mol is lovely, sweet, and actually very naive as Anna. Jennifer Tilly is excellent as the quirky, sheltered blind sister, Nina, who finds unexpected romance with Jesus, a dishwasher who embraces life, wonderfully portrayed by Vincent Laresca. The rest of the cast is equally outstanding, and does an excellent job of portraying this wacky, dysfunctional, but loving family.MUSIC FROM ANOTHER ROOM is an odd-ball, funny, wacky romantic comedy that will tickle your funny bone and warm your heart. Yes, it is predicable, standard stuff, but it is very, very well done, for what it is. These characters and their story really capture your heart, and keep you caring until the very end. If you want to spend a quiet evening cuddling on the couch with your sweetie, then this is the perfect movie. Popcorn and snuggles, what a perfect evening with the one you love.

CLUB DEAD, the third installment in Charlaine Harris's well-known Sookie Stackhouse series. As with the first two in the series, CLUB DEAD is fun, quirky, and delightfully entertaining. In fact, all the books in the Southern Vampire Mysteries series are perfect summer reads; they take you away from everyday cares and woes, and immerse you in adventure, romance, and the paranormal.This time, Sookie is on her way to Jackson, Mississippi. Bill has gone missing, and Eric has sent her to the infamous CLUB DEAD to find out what has happened. But Sookie has other reasons for wanting to find Bill - it seems that Bill has betrayed her and has run off with his former lover, Lorena. Needless to say, Sookie is NOT PLEASED, and in her more than confused state, finds herself attracted to Alcide, a werewolf who has been sent to protect her. More conflicted than ever, Sookie must find Bill, fend off Eric, and deal with her feeling for Alcide, all without getting killed herself.Sookie continues to be a lovable, interesting, charming character, one that starting to feel like a real friend. There are very few characters to whom I get emotionally attached: Dirk Pitt (Clive Cussler), Harry Dresden (Jim Butcher), and Natasha Chamberlain (Christy Tillery French) are the only three that I wait breathlessly for each year. But now, I am adding Sookie Stackhouse to that short list. In the space of two short weeks this summer, I read all 10 Sookie Stackhouse books, and I still want more. Sookie (like the other three characters mentioned above) has become a friend, someone I will look forward to seeing every year. I love strong, wacky, independent characters, and Sookie certainly fits that bill. When things get tough and downright dirty, Sookie is a no nonsense kind of girl who spits in trouble's eye and does what she needs to do. I also like Charlaine Harris's easy-breezy, faced-paced writing style. It is friendly, action-packed, and page turning.CLUB DEAD is an excellent continuation of a strong and pleasurable series. It is pure enjoyment, satisfying brain candy, and just plain fun. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for all the Sookie-lovers out there.

THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is a different sort of Disney princess movie. Oh, all the iconic trappings are here: "wishing upon a star", "the handsome prince", "a fairy godmother", "an ugly stepsister," "an evil villain", and "a Cinderella-like princess". But this time, Disney digs a little deeper, taking these icons to newer, more modern, stronger heights. In THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, "wishing upon a star" AND hard work make dreams come true, "the handsome prince" is a bit of a scallywag, "the fairy godmother" is a Bayou voodoo queen, "the ugly stepsister" is a bit shallow, but also beautiful, warm, caring, and the best friend of "the princess, "the evil villain" is a down on his luck voodoo huckster, and "the Cinderella-like princess" is a waitress who works too hard and has forgotten how to have fun.THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is not your standard the-prince-saves-the-princess-and-they-all-live-happily-ever-after fairytale. Rather, it is a story of the prince and the princess working together to solve their problems, each complementing the other, and helping each other to grow. The choices are hard and not always clear. This princess is very strong and capable; she works hard for her dreams, but still learns to risk wishing upon the star. What a wonderful new role model! And along the way, she has her family and friends to lean on.I have already watched THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG twice with my nearly 5 year old daughter, and she has declared the evil villain "not scary." The scenes involving "the shadow man" are a little dark, but at the same time they are vivid and colorful. They are also a bit vague, which detracts from their scariness. (If you aren't paying attention, you will miss things. Which may be how Disney planned it.) Overall, I would put those scenes at the same scary-level as the "Heffalumps and Woozles" song from Winnie the Pooh.And let's not forget the wonderful music from THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. Again, Disney has gone in a completely different direction from its norm. THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is set in New Orleans, and the music is everything you can imagine it should be: jazzy, bright, bold, and bouncy with a Cajun spice. Toe tappin' and head boppin'! What a great change of pace! Also of note is the fact that THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is hand-drawn like the original Disney animated movies. And I must say it is quite a vibrant and lovely masterpiece. Computers are NOT always better!My entire family really is really enjoying THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG (even my nearly 13 year old). I anticipate many more viewings in the weeks to come. Quirky, unique, and a little bit odd-ball, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. I think this movie will surprise you. It sure surprised me.

BEING THERE is a wonderful film; simple, quiet, and extremely though provoking. One of Peter Sellers' final and, perhaps, best performances, the role of Chance the gardener is a huge departure from the typical, over-the-top, slapstick comedic roles for which he is so well known and loved. An amazing mixture of political satire, social commentary, and Biblical metaphor, BEING THERE is strangely prophetic and very relevant to our own current political drama.In BEING THERE, we meet Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers), a mentally handicapped man who has learned everything he knows from TV and has had no other interaction with the outside world. Chance appears to have been born in the garden, and has never been outsides its walls. When his employer, the Old Man, dies, Chance is thrown into the real world. Chance's initial interactions with the outside world are very innocent, simplistic, and very literal. When the wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a wealthy power broker (Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself mingling with the rich and famous. To Chance, these are just people, people whose kindnesses and words he takes at face value. Yet these people believe that Chance is great man and a great scholar; they believe that his simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life, business, and politics. Chance becomes a valued and well known advisor to the rich and famous, to the country, and to the world.While Peter Sellers is always fun, in BEING THERE the humor is more muted and subtle. BEING THERE is a successful mockery of political conceit and the effects of seeing what you want to see. The character of Chance is a mirror; the people who go to him for advice see what they want to see - what they NEED to see - whether the subject is political, business, or just plain life. To me, BEING THERE is a new, updated version of the old fable The Emperor's New Clothes.Peter Sellers is outstanding in this, his penultimate role. His performance is subtle, calm, and nuanced to near perfection. He makes you want to laugh, to cry, and to just plain hope. Shirley MacLaine as a woman looking for love and Melvyn Douglas as her dying, powerful husband are both superb. In fact the entire cast does a marvelous job.As previously stated, BEING THERE is thoughtful, understated film, brilliant in its simplicity. The finale of the film is a subject of much debate, but like Chance, himself, I think the ending is what you want it to be. However, if you take the metaphors of the Old Man, the Garden, etc, to their natural conclusion, the meaning of the ending is quite clear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

When the wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a wealthy power broker (Melvyn Douglas) accidently hits Chance with her car, he finds himself hanging out with the rich and famous. To Chance, these are just people, people whose kindnesses and words he takes at face value. Yet these people believe that Chance is great man and a great scholar; they believe that his simple observations about plants are rich metaphors for life, business, and politics. Chance becomes a valued and well known advisor to the rich and famous, to the country, and to the world.While Peter Sellers is always fun, in BEING THERE the humor is more muted and subtle. BEING THERE is a successful mockery of political conceit and the effects of seeing what you want to see. The character of Chance is a mirror; the people who go to him for advice see what they want to see - what they NEED to see - whether the subject is political, business, or just plain life. To me, BEING THERE is a new, updated version of the old fable The Emperor's New Clothes.Peter Sellers is outstanding in this, his penultimate role. His performance is subtle, calm, and nuanced to near perfection. He makes you want to laugh, to cry, and to just plain hope. Shirley MacLaine as a woman looking for love and Melvyn Douglas as her dying, powerful husband are both superb. In fact the entire cast does a marvelous job.As previously stated, BEING THERE is thoughtful, understated film, brilliant in its simplicity. The finale of the film is a subject of much debate, but like Chance, himself, I think the ending is what you want it to be. However, if you take the metaphors of the Old Man, the Garden, etc, to their natural conclusion, the meaning of the ending is quite clear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I really did not know what to expect when I sat down to watch Hellboy. While there have been some excellent movies based on comic books, I had never even heard of Hellboy until recently, and did not have high hope. But the trailer for Hellboy 2 was so entertaining, that I figured I needed to give Hellboy a try.What a surprise! Hellboy is a light-hearted action-horror film (there's a new genre for you!). It is filled with action and suspense, yet it is also filled with comedy and charm. This movie does not try to take itself too seriously. My guess is that it comes pretty close to the comic books, and does not try to be "more".Ron Perlman truly shines as Hellboy, bright red skin, horns, and all. The tender scenes between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) (fire-starter and love interest) are sweet and funny. Doug Evans is very engaging as Abe Sapien, Hellboy's friend and partner. John Hurt is excellent as Hellboy's "father." Another standout is Jeffery Tambor as Hellboy's boss. He is a real jerk throughout most of the film, and you just plain don't like him. But near the end, the "Thank You" scene between these two actors is dead-pan perfection.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie about good verses evil, where the (unlikely) superhero makes a difficult choice, and still gets the girl in the end. As I said before, I had no idea what to expect, and wasn't even sure that I would like it. But, there is something quite appealing and charming about this film; it almost sneaks up on you. I highly recommend that you give it a try.

TEMPTING FAITH DINAPOLI is nothing more than YA pornography. Aimed at middle schoolers (ages 11-13), TEMPING FAITH DINAPOLI contains graphic sex scenes, plenty of foul language and racial slurs, casual alcohol and drug use, and homosexuality. In her column at Nerve.com, the author describes this as a "coming of age confection" and laments that she didn't put more sex in it. She quotes a review that describes the main character's losing her virginity as "white trash date rape." Having read the scene myself, I agree.There is nothing tender or exciting or even interesting about this book. This is absolutely not a book for pre-teens or tweens, and I wouldn't even recommend it to teenagers. Coming of age is one thing; explicit details of rape and oral sex are something else.It most certainly does not belong in a middle school library. A middle school library should be a safe haven for students to find books that are interesting and appropriate. Now, don't get me wrong, I have no issues with this book being for sale in a book store or available in a public library. In such places kids and parents together can make the decision as to whether or not this book is appropriate for the child in question. But a middle school library is a place where kids pick books largely unsupervised. While most schools have wonderful, informed librarians, the librarians can't read every book available, and they cannot assist every student looking for a book.Based on the jacket cover - a rosary made of pieces of candy - my 11 year old daughter thought this book was about girl like her. She had no idea what it contained. When she came to the rape scene, she was shocked and very frightened, she came to us sobbing. The details of the scene completely overwhelmed her. This child knows what sex is and knows what rape is, but she does not need to read anything this graphic and violent at the AGE OF ELEVEN. Our very smart girl immediately brought the book to us, where we found the descriptions of oral sex, homosexual interactions, and drug use as well. No eleven year old or any middle schooler needs to be exposed to this. Ever.

When I was growing up, my mother always told me that FROSTY THE SNOWMAN was my story. After all, the little girl who befriends Frosty and tries to help him is named Karen. (My sister, whose name is Cindy, got The Grinch Who Stole Christmas as her story...because of Little Cindy Lou Who.) This phenomenon explains why all of my Christmas decorations involve snowmen, and why my house looks like a winter wonderland this time of year.These days, it is my three year old daughter who believes that the story of FROSTY THE SNOWMAN is about her Mommy. We sit together and watch this DVD repeatedly during the holidays. She is entranced, just like I was. She always says, "That's you, Mommy, with the yellow hair" and "Look, Mommy, you are crying because Frosty has melted." She asks for this movie on a daily basis.This has always been my favorite children's Christmas classic, and it is now the favorite of my young daughter. She knows all the words to the Frosty song (even better that I do!), and just loves to sing along. The song itself is catchy, fun, and very memorable, the animation is typical of the time period and still looks good, and the story is one of giving and the Christmas spirit. Kids of all ages love this tale, because it is the children who believe in and who save Frosty, their beloved friend.FROSTY THE SNOWMAN always puts me in the holiday spirit, and I love sharing my personal tradition with my wee one. Even as a child of Texas, she loves snow, snowmen, and snow angels. How like her mother she is!

My three year old received this wagon for her birthday. We have recently given up the stroller, and were looking for something to take to the park and on walks around the neighborhood. Radio Flyer has outdone themselves on this little red wagon. We just love it.This wagon has high back seats for comfort and three-point (between the leg) seat belts for safety. The seat backs also fold down flat, transforming into a traditional wagon. It handles quite easily both pulling and pushing, and is very sturdy - no fear of tipping. And don't forget the cup holders...4 built in cup holders, perfect for cold drinks in sippies or juice boxes! There is lots of room for diaper bags, toys, etc. The wheels provide a smooth and comfy ride over all types of terrains. Additionally, if you purchase theRadio Flyer Umbrella Accessory, which easily clamps on to the side, your child will be protected from the sun, too.The assembly is a breeze - just follow the included instructions. We had it together and in action in a matter of minutes. This wagon has worked so well for us that we may just pop it in the back of the car for our trip to the zoo this weekend. Highly recommended.

My 3 year old little daughter LOVES the Pigeon books by Mo Willems, and she hoped to use her Christmas gift card to buy another Pigeon book. But it turns out that we own them all. She was looking extremely sad and disappointed, until she spied another Mo Willems classic on the rack - KNUFFLE BUNNY. She was immediately drawn to the cover with the little girl, Trixie, carrying her "snuggle bunny." My wee one carries her version of a snuggle bunny, BeeWee, with her everywhere. She had an instant connection with KNUFFLE BUNNY, and she could not wait to get it home.In KUFFLE BUNNY, daddy takes Trixie on an errand to the laundromat. Trixie and daddy have a great time, and they actually get the laundry in the washing machine. On the way home, Trixie suddenly discovers that her KUFFLE BUNNY is missing! She tries to tell daddy what is wrong, but Trixie is too young to talk. In tears and full of frustration, daddy and Trixie finally make it back home. Mommy opens the door and immediately knows what is wrong. KNUFFLE BUNNY is missing! The entire family rushes back to the laundromat, and, eventually, KNUFFLE BUNNY is found. Trixie is so excited that she says her first words, "KNUFFLE BUNNY."My daughter and I both relate to this story in so many ways. "BeeWee" is my daughter's version of KNUFFLE BUNNY, and BeeWee goes every where my child does. It IS a crisis when BeeWee is missing (although less and less of one the older she gets). My youngest clearly understood what Trixie was feeling when KNUFFLE BUNNY went missing; there were tears in her eyes, along with genuine concern. And she was very, very happy, too, when KNUFFLE BUNNY was found. And the ending brought a smile to my face, remembering that my child's first word was "BeeWee."The artwork in KNUFFLE BUNNY is very unique and interesting. Trixie, mommy, daddy, and KNUFFLE BUNNY are all cartoons drawn on real black and white photographs of a small neighborhood. This really makes these characters pop and helps young eyes focus in on the action. I found it very clever and effective.KNUFFLE BUNNY is a Caldecott Honor Book and quite deserving of that honor. KNUFFLE BUNNY is that special kind of book that can be thoroughly enjoyed by both preschoolers and their parents. A rare treat, indeed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I am no stranger to Epson photo printers having owned a Stylus Photo 1240 and a Stylus Photo R1800. As with its predecessors, the 1400 is itself a work of art. The prints it produces are sharp, vibrant, and lifelike. I tested all of the sizes this printer is capable of producing from 4x6 all the way up to 13x19. All color prints were flawless.SPECIFICSPackaging:This is a big printer. It has to be to handle 13x19 prints. Even so, Epson has made many parts collapsible so that you can tuck it under your bed. Inside the box, the printer is kept in a handy lift bag that allows you to pull the printer straight up and out of the box. Most of what you need is included - a manual, a CD, and a special feeder for printing directly onto CDs.What's NOT in the box is a USB cable and sample paper. Admittedly, I have scores of USB cables, and I have a lot of printer paper, but Epson has previously included these items.Setup:Simple. Pull off all the tape. Open the 2 packages of ink cartridges and remove all their tapes. Plug in the printer and hit the ink button. Load the cartridges. Press the ink button again. Load your paper.Of note is the noisy (scary) print head alignment when the printer is turned on for the first time. Just let it go. It never does it after the first time.Next, you'll need to install the drivers. The printer comes with drivers but it is almost always best to ignore those and go online to get the most recent releases. That's what I did. Just go to Epson.com, navigate to the printer drivers and select the 1400. They have drivers for Mac and Windows, XP and Vista32/64. I installed the Vista 32 driver and the Epson EasyPrint software which helps you navigate through the printer options on your computer.Printing:As I said, I have experience with photo printing. Unfortunately, that means that I have had to learn about color models, Photoshop, and everything that can make what looks great on the screen look dreadful on the printed page. I brought this knowledge with me when testing the 1400. Since this is a review of the printer, I won't go into those other aspects, but do keep in mind that there are a dozen things that can cause your prints to look "off." But if you've got those under control, then this printer works like a charm.NOTE: Once you think you're ready to print, do this first - clean the print heads. Buried in the printer dialog box is a tab labeled Maintenance. Under that tab is an option to clean the print heads, another noisy task. You'll have to do this 2 or 3 times in a row. I didn't and my first print looked like a drug-induced hallucination. Yikes! After the cleaning, it was perfect.Also buried in the printer dialog is the option to print fast or slow. If you just want an idea of what the real photo will look like, then choose fast. The quality is awful, so avoid that for your real photos. There are dozens of options and possible combinations of settings but that's an obvious one that is confined to the printer.Black and White:I said earlier that all color prints were flawless. But when I tried printing a black and white photo, I got more of a sepia and white photo. I checked all of the myriad things I could think of that might cause this but in the end, I could not get a true black and white image. It was black and white on the screen and in fact had no color information at all. When printing, I told the 1400 to print in grayscale and everything was using the printer's color model, including the photo itself. So this is a failing of either the printer or this reviewer.Paper and Ink:Epson paper is good. For my tests, I used Epson Luster and Konica Glossy. You have to tell the printer what kind of paper you're using. Again, buried in the print dialog, is a pull down menu for that. Unfortunately, Epson chose to use abbreviations such as PLPP for their Premium Luster Photo Paper. When using the Konica paper, I had to guess, since Konica uses a different naming convention. Cost for the paper ranges from $.16 for a 4x6 sheet, to $.60 for an 8.5x11 sheet up to $1.63 for a 13x9 sheet.The ink that comes with the printer is Epson's Claria "High-Definition" ink. Epson says the ink will not fade for 98 years. That seems plenty long for pictures of me in a Halloween costume to last. Too long. But here's the thing about inks: That's where all printer companies make their money. This printer retails for $300. Each of the 6 ink cartridges retails of $22. Some places sell the ink for less, but then add big shipping charges bringing the total back to $22. Lots of places sell "replacement" inks that will work in this printer, but my experience with such inks for the R1800 have not been good. I've ended up going back to the original Epson inks.Bottom Line:It's a great printer but it's a lot more expensive than it seems, because of ink replacement costs. Epson bills it as the little sister to the R1800, but I have both and really can't see a difference.

My three year old and I both love this at bedtime. THE CAT IN THE HAT SONGBOOK/IF I RAN THE ZOO/DR. SEUSS SLEEPBOOK CD provides three Seuss experiences in one, starting with a typical Seussical story, IF I RAN THE ZOO, then moving on to some fun and funny songs from THE CAT IN THE HAT SONGBOOK, and ending with the wonderful sleep-inducing story, THE DR. SEUSS SLEEPBOOK. This combination makes the transition from restless wakefulness to sound asleep very smooth and easy, and, quite frankly, often puts mom to sleep in her chair, too.The first track on this terrific CD is IF I RAN THE ZOO, voiced by Marvin Miller. Here familiar, zany rhymes describe the wild, weird, and wonderful zoo animals of Dr. Seuss's incomparable imagination. The next tracks are some very memorable songs from THE CAT IN THE HAT SONGBOOK. My favorite it here is Uncle Terrwilliger Dances With Bears. These songs start off at a pleasant, upbeat tempo, and gradually slow down until the final, dreamy Party Parting song. The final track is the yawn-inducing DR. SEUSS'S SLEEP BOOK. By the end of this sleepy story, the young one is gently snoring. I'm not certain that *I* have ever heard the end of it, either.If you have trouble with a little one who doesn't want to go to bed or won't stay in bed, this CD is just the ticket. Young children are so entranced by this CD that they are fast asleep before they every realize it. That Dr. Seuss was a very clever man!

STARSHIP TROOPERS 3: MARAUDER is a direct to DVD movie based loosely on a world and characters created by Robert A. Heinlein in his classic sci-fi adventure novel STARSHIP TROOPERS. While this movie is neither high budget nor high art, it is a very entertaining way to spend an evening at home. It is also a MUCH better follow on to the original STARSHIP TROOPERS movie than the simply dreadful second installment.Casper Van Dien returns as our hero, Johnny Rico. His is joined by STAR TREK veteran Jolene Blalock as the rather well-formed, command pilot, damsel-in-distress. The performances by these two are very enjoyable, and it is good to see them both working again. They are joined by a very able supporting cast, all of whom add to the fun.The special effects are a bit worn and corny, but overall, they work just fine for the comic book style of the movie. The Bugs are back, still trying to exterminate the humans, and we are trying just as hard to exterminate them back. Tons of explosions, lots of gore, and our hero saves the day. Pretty much what you want in a good, old fashioned "B" movie.And the best part of all, we finally, finally get what we have been waiting for: the Mech Suits!! They were everything I had always imagined, and more. What took you guys so long??? The mechanized battle suits are what define the Mobile Infantry. Now, Johnny Rico will truly be the hero that Heinlein wrote. STARSHIP TROOPERS 3: MARAUDER is well worth seeing, especially for that reason. Recommended.

DOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE DEAD is a very fun, very entertaining Easter special that provides fans with a light-hearted episode featuring David Tennant, the beloved Tenth Doctor. As we all know by now, this shortened 5th season will be Mr. Tennant's last, and it certainly was enjoyable to see him save the day in typical easy-going fashion.DOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE DEAD is full of the characteristic energy and charm that is brought to the Tenth Doctor by David Tennant. He matches wits with Michelle Ryan, who would clearly make an excellent companion and foil for Mr. Tennant if he were continuing on. The chemistry between the two brought a well needed sparkle back to DOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE DEAD, and the pair was quite fun to watch.As DOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE DEAD opens, Lady Christina de Souza (Ryan) is attempting to evade the police after stealing a rare and priceless artifact. Of course, she ends up on the same tour bus as our quirky, lovable Doctor. And as is expected in any episode of DOCTOR WHO, that bus then drives through a wormhole in time and space and winds up on a desert planet, placing all aboard, and all life on Earth, in terrible danger. As always, it is up to our Doctor and his faithful companion to save humanity.The Dubai location of DOCTOR WHO: PLANET OF THE DEAD is quite spectacular, the aliens cool and retro, and the threat to Earth as expected. Is this "the best DOCTOR WHO episodes ever?" Of course not. But it is engaging, amusing, and very, very Tenth Doctor. It reminds us why we like David Tennant so much and why he will be sorely missed.

Convienient, cheap, and easy. What more could you ask for?I have tried other replacement brands of ink for my printer. The quality is poor, they don't last as long, and they dirty up my printer. If you own an Epson printer, Epson ink is the way to go.

Please note: it does not contain the black cartridge, and you still must buy the black ink separately. However, this is still the best price around (either multi pack or individual), especially since shipping is free.

My Friends by Taro Gomi is a beautifully illustrated book about learning simple skills...with a little help from your friends. And in this story, all creatures (from the tiniest ant to the teachers at school) are your friends. My daughter loves this book, reciting page after page which friend teaches her what task. The overall message of this book is that a child can learn something from everyone and everything.The artwork is delightful: colorful, simple, and crisp. The language sounds lyrical, even poetic, as you read it aloud. This book will capture the imagination of your child. Whenever we read it, my daughter gives me different examples of who has taught her what. It is a great conversation starter!I recommend this engaging book for all toddlers, beginning readers, or anyone who enjoys a sweet story.

We watched IT'S COMPLICATED the other night, with multiple generations in attendance. And everyone laughed out loud. IT'S COMPLICATED is a light-hearted, refreshing romantic comedy that will entertain you, brighten your spirit, and make you smile.In IT'S COMPLICATED, Jane and Jack have been divorced for 10 years now, and they have finally come to a sort of workable truce. They have three nearly grown kids together. Jane has a very successful restaurant, and Jake is happily married to the younger woman with whom he cheated. Or is he? Unacustomed time alone together at their youngest son's college graduation leads to an unexpected night in bed together. This one-night-stand blossoms into a full blown affair, which leaves Jane, Jake, and the entire audience wondering if old wounds can be healed and old love rekindled.While the plot of IT'S COMPLICATED really isn't (it's really pretty formulaic), the acting is truly magnificant. Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin imbue their characters with life; they truly jump off the screen. Meryl Streep is luminous - funny, warm, gorgeous, sentimental, sympathetic, sensual, and sexy as all get out. Wow, Meryl, please keep proving that life does not end at 40 and that Hollywood is not just for starlets. Alec Baldwin is excellent as Jake - a confused, aging little boy who wants whatever it is that he doesn't have. A near perfect role for Alec Baldwin. And Steve Martin as Adam, Jane's hope-to-be boyfriend, gives one of his best performances in years. The three of them have superb chemistry, and that alone makes this a 5 star film. The supporting cast are equally up to the task, and add depth and nuance to this film.IT'S COMPLICATED is a delightful way to spend a cozy evening cuddled up with the one you love. IT'S COMPLICATED brings the entertainment, the humor, and the romance. You just need to provide the popcorn and the fluffy blanket.

A GUY NAMED JOE is a wonderful, old-fashioned, patriotic film made in 1944 during WWII. Starring Spencer Tracy, Irene Dunne, Van Johnson, Ward Bond, and Lionel Barrymore, A GUY NAMED JOE is the story of Pete (Tracy), a hot shot bomber pilot, who dies when he purposefully crashes his disabled plane into a German aircraft carrier. Dorinda (Dunne), Pete's girl friend and a pilot with the Women's Air Ferrying Corps, is devastated, especially since she has just convinced Pete to take a safer assignment stateside teaching new recruits how to fly. In Heaven, which looks remarkably like an Army airfield only with soft, fluffy, white clouds on the ground, "The Commanding General" (Barrymore) makes Pete a guardian angel to Ted Randall (Johnson), a young, unsure Army pilot. Pete invisibly helps Ted through flight training and combat. Ted eventually picks of some of Pete's quirks and style, becoming quite a hot shot pilot himself. Of course, he eventually meets and falls in love with Dorinda, making Pete very jealous. Dorinda is still devoted to Pete's memory, but she, too, eventually falls for Ted. In the end, however, Pete lets Dorinda go, saving Dorinda, Ted, and even his own soul.This sweet, sentimental film combines the war genre with romantic fantasy. Directed by Victor Fleming and written by Dalton Trumbo, the script is wry and witty with both Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne delivering some great lines (hence the title of this review). Tracy, Dunne, and Johnson are all believable in their respective roles as well as what you expect them to be as actors. Barrymore is classic as "The Commanding General," and I loved Ward Bond as Pete and Dorinda's best friend. Considering this was filmed in 1944, the special effects are admirable and what you would expect from that era. Apparently, there are several inaccuracies in this film (e.g. there weren't any German aircraft carriers in WWII), but I simply did not care.A GUY NAME JOE is a terrific choice for a pleasant, sappy, nostalgic evening at home. You may need a hanky in a few spots. But watching this classic film, both my husband and I found smiles on our faces for most of the evening.Side notes: There is no character named Joe in this film. At the beginning some hero-worshipping kids explain that pilots in the Army Air Corps call any "right fellow" Joe. Also, A GUY NAMED JOE was remade in 1989 by Steven Spielberg as the movie ALWAYS.

Do you ever wonder if your cat can talk? If your cat really has nine lives? Where cats go when you are looking all over for them, and can't find them? Or how your cat can suddenly appear in a room that you are certain is empty? TIME CAT, a YA soft sci-fi fantasy by Lloyd Alexander, answers all of these questions and more.Not surprisingly to cat lovers, your cat can talk to you, but only if no one else is a round. Cats do not have nine lives, but here is where their magic comes in: they can visit nine lives - anywhere, any time, any country, any century. And they can take you with them.Gareth and his human friend, Jason set out on time travel trip, visiting 9 different eras and making a difference in the lives of nine different people, both historical figures and regular folks. They meet Saint Patrick, DaVinci, Manxmen, kings, Egyptians, Incas, a Japanese child-emperor, ancient Britons, and American revolutionaries. In each case, both Gareth and Jason have a positive impact on the people they meet, perhaps setting history on its proper course.TIME CAT is written is simple, easy style, perfect for young readers. The story of each era is told in a stand alone, 2-3 chapter section, creating a series of loosely related vignettes, almost short stories. This make the book very easy to pick up and put down, enjoying each section at your own pace and leisure.I read TIME CAT at the recommendation of my 11 year old. We both enjoyed traveling with Gareth very much. Perhaps Ping, our resident feline, will take us on travels of our own. I know Ping appears out of nowhere with alarming frequency. And I am certain he can talk.

YOU READ TO ME, I'LL READ TO YOU: VERY SHORT FAIRY TALES TO READ TOGETHER is part of a very creative series of books that encourages children and parents, siblings, or friends read stories out loud to each other, each playing a specific part. In YOU READ TO ME, I'LL READ TO YOU: VERY SHORT FAIRY TALES TO READ TOGETHER, each story is a well known fairy tale written as a conversation between two characters. They are a comical parody of the original fairy tales and are told in a read-aloud, rhyming, fractured manner that enables two people to read and laugh together at unsuspected outcomes. For example, Jack and the Giant come to an agreement to share the Giant's treasures that Jack stole, Cinderella invites her mean step-sisters to come live with her in the castle, Little Red Riding Hood takes Grandma and a starving wolf to a restaurant for lunch, Goldilocks befriends Baby Bear and takes him home with her to get some porridge, and the little pig in the brick house makes friends with the wolf who ate his two brothers. In fact, at the end of each story, enemies wind up friends reading to each other.This fun and delightful book is full of rhymes and rhythms, providing a helpful cadence for young readers to follow. While my three year old is still too young to read, she delights in hearing her eleven year old sister and me read the parts back and forth. The meter, tone, and style of the rhymes add to the fun and hilarity. As a matter of fact, these short tales are written in a way that almost sounds like rap. Rapping fairy tales, now that is funny! I think we will add music and sound effects the next time and see what happens!Each story is only two to four pages long, and the illustrations are colorful, bright, and very funny. This book, and the others in the series, are perfect for beginning readers. And any book that encourages families to read together is quite simply A-1 in my book.

My 4 year old daughter and I went to see Ballet Austin dance its Mother's Day performance of CINDERELLA today. My little one loves ballet and Cinderella, as do I. This was a perfect way for us to celebrate our special day together.Now, everyone knows the story of CINDERELLA, but at the theatre, they had these little pocket picture books available for a more than reasonable price. The CINDERELLA: FULL-COLOR PICTURE BOOK, by J. Sainsbury's Pure Tea, measures roughly 4 x 6 inches, is made of sturdy, laminated card stock, contains 6 gorgeous, full color illustrations, and in six easy to read pages, gives an excellent overview of the original story. The back of the book states that the lovely illustrations are reproductions from rare advertising cards of the Victorian era, and each is very vivid and quite detailed. This is not Disney or Rogers and Hammerstein, but it is not quite Grimm, either.This wonderful little paperback fits easily in a purse or bag, and is perfect for the car or a trip. It is also a nice length for a bedtime story. My wee one and I both enjoyed reading this little book, and it most certainly is a perfect keepsake to remember our 4th Mother's Day together.

I will probably draw heat for this review, as I have for some of my other comic book cum movie reviews, but so be it. I have not read the comic book so this review is strictly based on the movie, JONAH HEX.Set in the recently-post Civil War America, JONAH HEX is the story of a man driven by vengeance. During the closing days of the Confederacy, Jonah was ordered to destroy a hospital. When he refused, his commanding officer burned Jonah's family alive, forcing Jonah to watch. The commander then brands Jonah's face and leaves him to die, although he says the brand is so Jonah always remembers who did this to him. The Crow Indians rescue Jonah from the brink of death, leaving him with the ability to talk to, and torture, the dead. So Jonah sets out to kill his old CO who is now planning to destroy Washington DC with a super weapon.That is the basic story line of JONAH HEX, and you get most of it in the first few minutes of the movie. But what struck me was the similarity to the old Wild Wild West television series. In every blessed episode, we saw James West, the Secret Service agent, thwarting an evil genius who was trying destroy something. Jonah isn't as pretty as Jim West, but his role is the same. In the series, we had Artemis Gordon acting as a sort of M from James Bond. In JONAH HEX, we had Agent Broils from the Fringe series supplying horse-mounted Gatling guns and incendiary crossbows. In Wild Wild West, Jim's boss was President Grant. In JONAH HEX, he was working for President Grant. And of course, there are the pretty girls present in both.As I sat watching JONAH HEX, thinking about The Wild Wild West series, I realized how flat the movie is. The characters are cardboard, the plot is pointless, and even the visuals are ordinary. The acting was passable but not remarkable. The actors read their lines but they didn't own their characters. I started imaging other actors in those roles and found that it was a very easy exercise. In fact, it might have been a better movie if they had gotten unknowns to play the main roles.I'm giving JONAH HEX 3 stars because it didn't offend me and because no one used the word, "Friend-O." It just wasn't an exciting or even interesting movie, but if you have some ironing to do, this might fill the bill for something to have on in the background.

My husband and I may be the last two people on this planet, or any other, to see AVATAR. But after seeing it last night, we agree that AVATAR is the most visually stunning movie ever made. The colors are saturated and mind blowing; the effects and CGI are breathtaking and seamless; the details are thoughtful and magnificent. The future tech is credible and amazing. And the world of Pandora is brilliantly thought out. The culture, history, and very uniqueness of this alien planet and all her indigenous life forms are completely believable, minutely detailed, and exquisitely rendered; it is a rich civilization whose background and relationships to the world are incredibly developed and enveloping. The viewer easily becomes a part of this world, drinking in its sights, its sounds, and its people.The only criticism I have of AVATAR is the plot. The story told in AVATAR may be all dressed up in the most spectacular ball gown ever made, but it is still old, a story we've heard a million times. It is Lawrence of Arabia; it is Dances with Wolves; it is Pocahontas, to name just a few. The problem I see is this: we are what we can imagine. While there is no doubt that our history tells us that "civilized" humans have overrun and nearly destroyed indigenous peoples time and time again, there is no reason to suggest that we would do so in our future. Humans do learn from their mistakes. One thing science fiction has shown us that we become, we invent, and we seek what we dream. So if we produce movies and books and TV shows which show us exploring and making friends instead of invading, if we can get over the whole "humans bad" mentality, then we can achieve a more positive future. I prefer the future worlds of Star Trek and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, where humans communicate with and learn from aliens rather than attacking them.Overall, I did enjoy AVATAR very, very much, and I would most certainly watch it again. The fantastic world of Pandora is one to savored and revisited; there is no question about that. But AVATAR is not an instant classic; rather, it is a film making breakthrough, a technical masterpiece which represents several giant leaps forward in how movies are made, and the standard to which all movies will be held for years to come.

If you're like me, you might have missed the part where Calphalon says not to put this pot into the dishwasher. Oops! What happens is the soap does something to the aluminum, not sure what, turning it white and dry-looking. I contacted Calphalon about this and was told that I had voided the warranty on the pot and there was no way to fix it. Same story when I visited a Calphalon retail store. Sadness ensued.But then I noticed that I had gotten some olive oil on the lid, quite by accident. Where ever the olive oil was, the white dried-out patina wasn't. Hmm... So I wiped the entire pot down with a paper towel and olive oil. It was like magic. The pot looked like it's original self. Even after more than two years of use and only hand washing (now!) the pot is still as pretty as it was when I bought it. Warranty? I don't need no stinkin' warranty! I have olive oil!The most complicated thing I make in this pot is rice. Over medium-high heat, I put in some olive oil and chopped onions. When the onions are translucent, I add a cup of rice and stir it all around. When it starts to smell like popcorn, I then add a cup and a half of chicken broth and a pinch of saffron. Cover for about 15 minutes. I admit that I cheat and look before the 15 minutes are up. I TRY not to end up with a layer of crunchy rice on the bottom, although some family members consider that to be a treat.Of course, soups and sauces are a snap. The pot is light in weight and easy to clean, even if you have to do it by hand. It is a necessary addition to any kitchen. In fact, we have 3 and they all get used constantly.

DAYBREAKERS is a fresh take on the average vampire horror tale, bordering on camp, but definitely original. Quite unexpectedly, my husband and I really enjoyed this film. In DAYBREAKERS, we find that the human race was nearly destroyed by a plague, but vampires gave them a way out. Now vampires are the dominant species on earth, night and day are reversed, vampires are going about their normal "nightly" routines, and the remaining humans are hunted fugitives. There are so few humans remaining that a blood shortage is causing the vampires to panic, and the vampires have initiated a massive R&D; effort to create a synthetic substitute. if they don't find it, the vampires will mutate horribly and die. But there may be an alternative. One that will change the world of the vampires forever.If, like me, you find vampire horror films (not teen angst films) to be a guilty pleasure, then I think you will enjoy DAYBREAKERS. Part I Am Legend, part Buffy, part Blade (but all with a twist), DAYBREAKERS brings a unique and creative story to the average vampire flick. The plot is intriguing, and the ending is surprising. The special effects appropriately scary and interesting, the blood and gore as to be expected, and lore within the film is consistent. The acting is not the best I have seen, but it is not the worst either.For a fresh take on an old genre, give DAYBREAKERS a try. You might be glad you did.

When facing a tiger, you run, hide, or face it head on. In THE HURT LOCKER, the tiger is the ever-present possibility of being blown to bits, and the main character faces it head on.Set in Iraq, the three men of Bravo Company's EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) team have a healthy respect for roadside bombs. But despite taking all precautions, disaster strikes, leaving the team down a man. The replacement, Staff Sergeant James, is a self-confident veteran of Afghanistan whose first act is to remove the protective barrier over the windows of his barracks. He declares that he likes the sunlight and that the plywood won't protect him from an impact on the ceiling, anyway. It's the first hint that his world view might be a little different from that of the other members of the EOD. The first mission leaves no doubt of that. Upon arrival at the scene of the improvised explosive device (IED), SSgt. James refuses to use the remotely controlled robot, opting instead to wear "the suit" and search for the bomb himself. Since the bomb could be detonated at anytime from any of the buildings lining the street, SSgt. James' choice to go on foot seems insane, especially to his own men. Everyone, including the audience, is left wondering what would make a man take such unnecessary risks, but SSgt. James does so time and again. It is absolutely no surprise when, at the close of the movie, we see him returning to Iraq for another 365-day tour of duty. The simple fact is that he loves his work.I couldn't write this review for several days after seeing THE HURT LOCKER. I had to let it simmer on my subconscious for a while. The filmmakers wisely chose to stay away from any political statements and any kind of subjective commentary by the characters. All of the characters are 100% believable (to a civilian, at any rate), and they all seem 100% sane within the context of their own actions. This is to say that while I would not don the suit and march up to an IED, I do not see SSgt. James' willingness, nay eagerness, to do so any more insane than a racing driver who loves to roar around the track at more than 200mph. This man loved his work. It focused him and made him feel alive. And he was very good at it.The movie also reminded me of classics such as The Best Years of Our Lives, the William Wyler movie that depicted the difficulties of returning WWII veterans. While THE HURT LOCKER doesn't dwell on this aspect, it shows it starkly in about 3 minutes worth of scenes. The most jarring is a pair of scenes which start with a horrible incident in Iraq and switch almost immediately to SSgt. James back home in a grocery store aisle trying to decide which of 500 boxes of cereal to buy. I watched that thinking, "Free Willy!"Also of note is the lack of blood and guts in the movie. They didn't need it to tell the story. There was some crude language, but, and I am not exaggerating, there was more of that in Trading Places, which I watched again recently. The acting was all top-notch and believable, made doubly so by some A-List cameos who get killed after 5 minutes on screen. I sat there thinking, "But I liked him. I wanted to see more of him. He can't be dead." As I pondered this later, I realized that perhaps that was the intended effect. Perhaps, and if so, then it was genius - this was a way to make the movie more personal.I also think it's worth spelling out that THE HURT LOCKER is not so much a war movie as it is a movie set in a war. The characters could have been firefighters or cops or any number of high-danger professionals, and the story would still have worked. Even so, I wouldn't change a thing. THE HURT LOCKER works just fine as it is.

Based on the recommendation of an Ammie friend, I bought this "UT orange" lunch box for my soon to be middle schooler on her 11th birthday. She is far too old and too cool for "branded" lunch boxes, and wanted something stylish, different, and grown up as she enters 6th grade. This unique lunch box fits the bill perfectly.Made of light weight, insulating neoprene, this compact lunch box keeps food at the desired temperature. With a separate bottle compartment, you can pack both a cold drink and warm food. It holds a surprising quantity of food, stretching to hold whatever you put in it. It also unzips to form a flat eating surface, which is nice if you are trying to avoid sticky cafeteria tables, and then rolls up to neatly fit into any backpack or book bag. Machine washable and very durable, I feel confident that it will last the entire school year, if not longer.Fun, functional, and highly recommended.

When I first heard of THE MIST, I was thinking it was a remake of the 1980 flick, The Fog, with Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. Oops. No such luck. Instead I found myself in a Stephen King movie, which was quite fine by me. I've enjoyed several of Stephen Kings other books and films including The Stand, Stand By Me, The Tommyknockers, and even the Langoliers, but I had never read this one. It begins with an inside joke where an artist is painting a movie poster for a Stephen King novel and has other famous movie posters displayed as if he had painted them. We meet the family, the neighbor, and soon, half the town. And then THE MIST rolls in.Most of THE MIST takes place in a supermarket and most of the movie is typical Stephen King. We get to know a group of ordinary people who start to show their true colors as the pressure mounts. And the pressure mounts, you betcha! We have all sorts of creatures coming out of the mist to eat our frugal shoppers. But we also have our very own annoying humans inside the store, including an "unstable" Christian woman who constantly preaches her own version of the Bible and the end-of-days. As the movie progresses, we lose more shoppers until... I can't give away the ending, but I do have to talk about the ending. It's a very bad ending. And, apparently, it wasn't Stephen King's original ending. It's an ending that belongs in a different kind of movie, not a jump-out-of-the-mist-and-go-boo! movie. I mean, THE MIST is a modern B-Movie, and we all have certain expectations that go along with those. For instance, when the boy and girl make out, we know they're the next to die. Check. When anyone smiles or think they've made it, they're about to die in a particularly gruesome way. Check. And when our heroes risk everything to put an end to what's been dogging them, we expect ... well, we know what we expect and that box was definitely left unchecked.If it weren't for the ending, I'd have gladly given THE MIST higher marks for knowing that it was a Saturday matinee monster movie. Unfortunately, at the very last minute, it tried to be something more important, which is exactly what I did not want.Stephen King himself is quoted as saying, "The ending is such a jolt--wham! It's frightening. But people who go to see a horror movie don't necessarily want to be sent out with a Pollyanna ending." Well, this person does!

I really loved NO FLYING IN THE HOUSE as a child. (I still have my original copy, which is 38 years old!) I still love it now. And I have just finished reading it to my three year old daughter, who was very taken with it. It was a delightful adventure for both of us, being able to share a true favorite together.NO FLYING IN THE HOUSE is the story of 3 year old Annabel Tippens and her companion Gloria. Gloria is a small white dog, three inches long and three inches high; she can sit in the palm of your hand. But that is not the most remarkable thing about Gloria: she talks, she is extremely smart, and is the sole care-giver to young Annabel, whose parents have had to go away and who have entrusted Gloria with Annabel's care, upbringing and protection. But even that is not the MOST remarkable thing about Gloria...Annabel is not quite what she seems, either. As Annabel gets older, she begins to discover certain unique abilities. As a matter of fact, Annabel can fly. (What little girl doesn't dream of flying???) It seems that Gloria has a secret that she has been keeping from Annabel, for her own good. Annabel isn't just any little girl, she is a true fairy princess. Unfortunately, Annabel discovers this secret, and now she must make a very important choice, one that will change her life forever.NO FLYING IN THE HOUSE written in a simple, straight forward style that captures the hearts and imaginations of readers young and old alike. It is an exciting tale of fairies and flying, that also teaches the true meaning of love. It is a wonderful story to share, and I am so glad that I did.

Tim Allen is back as Santa Claus, and is even more fun than before. It seems there is yet another "clause" that must be fulfilled in the Santa contract. Scott Calvin must immediately find a wife if he is to remain Santa. In THE SANTA CLAUSE 2: THE MRS. CLAUSE, Santa has 28 days (until Christmas Eve) to do just that...And the desantification process has already begun!THE SANTA CLAUSE 2: THE MRS. CLAUSE is a very cute, very entertaining, happy-making, feel good movie. Tim Allen does a fantastic job reprising the role of Santa/Scott Calvin. Tim Allen IS Santa Claus... at least, I know I am a believer. The elves are fun, cute, and perky, and Santa's workshop is outstanding in every vivid detail.This is one sequel worth seeing again and again. My family loves THE SANTA CLAUSE 2: THE MRS. CLAUSE as much as the original THE SANTA CLAUSE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this modern day classic.

RED RIDING HOOD is a re-imagining of the classic fairytale. The problem is that they've turned it into a soft-core teen romance, and since I haven't been a teen for 2 or 3 decades, I found the love scenes disturbing. Can you say, "Peeping Tom?" I knew that you could!So be aware that RED RIDING HOOD is a period teen romance with supernatural creatures, none of whom sparkle. Beyond that, it's mildly entertaining with okay performances by Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. They're only okay, which is a shame, but the movie isn't about them. Neither is it about Lukas Haas (didn't he die of an overdose of Pop-Rocks in Vietnam?) who has an odd part to play. All of the acting is serviceable but there's nothing exciting about it. Again, it's all about the teens and even though they're pretty, they're nothing to write home about.Oh, I forgot to mention the plot of RED RIDING HOOD. Here goes: A teeny-weenie medieval village is terrorized by a werewolf. Gary Oldman is a sort of Grand Inquisitor cum Van Helsing who arrives to save the day. Madcap mayhem (and teen love) ensue.I gave RED RIDING HOOD a 3 because I recognize that I am not the target demographic. If you're a veteran of more than 25 summers, you might want to steer clear of this one. Peeping Toms, on the other hand...

I just finished watching FARSCAPE: THE COMPLETE SERIES, all four seasons and 88 episodes, with my husband, who is a long time fan. After seeing this wonderful science fiction space opera for the first time, I have no idea why I didn't watch it when it originally aired 10 years ago. This is some of the best sci-fi I have seen in years, not to mention, some of the best television. Almost a space western, FARSCAPE is an exciting adventure, with gorgeous special effects, great characters, and an intricate story arc that grabs and holds your attention throughout the entire series.I will provide just the basic plot of FARSCAPE, here. Earth astronaut John Crichton, on an experimental space mission, is accidentally pulled into a wormhole and hurled across the universe into the midst of an intergalactic conflict. Trapped on a living space ship, living among alien creatures who wield deadly technology and are being hunted by a merciless military race, John Crichton finds himself on an epic journey more spectacular than anything he has ever imagined. Along the way he finds friends, enemies, and love, but he never stops searching for the way home.Ten plus years after its original airing, FARSCAPE is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The stories are still interesting and relevant, the characters remarkable and unique, and the adventure worth living. Even the special effects still hold up magnificently. There are not too many high tech series that can make these claims.What really makes FARSCAPE tick are the wonderful, well developed, imperfect characters. Even the ones that are Muppets. Yes, Muppets. Jim Henson's Muppets. All of the characters on this show are so well defined, so complete, so rich in history and self actualization, that you forget the Muppets are, well, muppets. They are real, and every bit as essential to the plot lines as the flesh characters are. Good, evil, or somewhat ambiguous, you come to care about all of these characters and what happens to them. They are full of life, full of foibles, and full of angst, and they don't necessarily respond as humans would. Each is out for his own gain, his own agenda, but still, they come to depend on each other and become a family. Including their living ship, Moya, who frequently has a mind of her own.Another wonderful aspect of FARSCAPE is the creators' ability to push boundaries and to have fun. Mixed in among the serious drama episodes, are fun, hilarious, unexpected treasures, that while unique and often odd-ball, still further the plot, but successfully relieve some of the building tension.If you are a fan of space opera, then FARSCAPE should not be missed. If you are a fan of adventure, great tv, and interesting and fun stories, then FARSCAPE should not be missed. I have to say, though, that the only part of FARSCAPE that I did not like was the last minute and a half of the final episode. I hated it completely. Luckily...there was more to come...MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The E4300 Dual Core from Intel has been around for over a year now. When it was first released, it was hailed by enthusiasts as the "perfect storm" of a CPU because by design or chance, the unit was eminently overclockable and vastly cheaper than its contemporaries. I confess that I am not an enthusiast but my husband is. He designed a new system around this chip, which is still selling for the same price it was more than a year ago. That should be some indication of its staying power.As I understand it, most computer chips - CPUs, memory, etc. - are rated to run at a certain speed. When you buy a computer from a manufacturer such as Dell, that manufacturer usually provides no method of changing those speeds. But when you build your own computer, you can select all the parts yourself and pick the ones that can be run at higher speeds. So this CPU, which is rated at 1.8 GHz, can actually be run at 3.0 GHz and faster. When it was introduced, it sold for around $150. But if you were to buy an Intel CPU that was rated to run at 3.0GHz, you'd have paid a retail price of over $1000.The trick is match the components so that they all work together at the higher speeds and nothing overheats. My husband spent quite a bit of time researching every scrap of info he could and eventually did build a great system he was happy with. He's still happy with it more than a year later, mainly because of this CPU, which he has been running at 3.0GHz all that time, with XP, then later with Vista.But time marches on and for just a few dollars more, you can now get an Intel Quad-Core CPU. That's 4 CPUs on one chip. I can't wait to see what they come up with next year!

I really wanted to like KICK-ASS. The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing. But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick. So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot. For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS. It could have been a really good, positive movie. But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly. Yes, there are some funny moments, and yes, the ending is actually satisfying, but overall, KICK-ASS is just disturbing, and I won't recommend it to anyone.

The odd thing about Tom Cruise is that I think I hate him. I tell people I do, and I actively avoid his movies. But some of my favorite flicks are his, including Risky Business, The Last Samurai, and Minority Report. I can now add KNIGHT AND DAY to that list.KNIGHT AND DAY is pure fun. It is an action comedy that doesn't try too hard, has a lot of intimate moments at offbeat times, and is completely endearing from start to finish. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz click with lots of action, witty dialog, and great chemistry. Think of it as a much better take on the Scarecrow and Mrs. King. Cruise is a secret agent that seems to have lost a marble or two. Diaz is just a normal girl who rebuilds old muscle cars. And while it's easy to think of the movie as a parody or a sendup of all spy movies or even just Cruise's own Mission Impossible series, it isn't. It's not a farce or a spoof. It's just a tight, kooky, engaging flick that stands on its own. And KNIGHT AND DAY is rated PG-13 which makes it great to watch with the entire family. We watched this with 3 generations (from 5 to 75), and everyone enjoyed themselves.The Blu-Ray version of KNIGHT AND DAY is especially nice, with fantastic DTS sound and amazing color and clarity. Honestly, I've seen it twice and could watch it a few more times. The last movie I felt that way about was the 2009 Star Trek movie. For a light, cozy, entertaining evening at home, KNIGHT AND DAY is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Maybe I don't dislike Tom Cruise as much as I think I do...

First, let me say right up front that I have not read any of the Percy Jackson books. My 12 year old has read them all and loved them, but I did not read any of them before seeing PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF tonight. And while I see many, many similarities to the Harry Potter series, I really enjoyed THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Although it feels a bit familiar, it is still a fun and exciting adventure. And a very delightful family film.Percy Jackson is a misfit, always in trouble and having difficulty in school. He has a lot of trouble reading; the letters dance around the page. The one place he feels at home is in the water. Turns out, there is a good reason for that. It seems that Percy is the son of the god Poseidon and a human mother. And there are others like him, "half-blood" kids (demi-gods) who all attend a special camp to learn to use their powers and to protect themselves. But now, the Earth is in danger. Someone has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt. If it is not returned by the solstice, then the gods will go to war. And humanity will suffer the consequences. Did Percy steal Zeus's bolt? If not, then who did? Can Percy and his companions Annabeth and Grover find the lightning bolt and return it to Olympus before the deadline?As you can see from the above synopsis, there are huge parallels between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter - secret powers, a trio of friends, a special school, a dangerous quest, and the world in peril. Add to that director Chris Columbus, who also happened to direct the first two Potter films, and you get a movie with a very similar look and feel. But in this case, the copy holds up well to the original. THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a an enjoyable romp through Greek mythology with really great special effects, an engaging story, good acting, and an amusing touch of humor. All-in-all, it made for a terrific evening out with my family. And you can bet that I will be reading these books very soon.

THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is another in a long line of Philip K. Dick screen adaptations. It's predecessors include Blade Runner, Total Recall, The Imposter, and The Minority Report. Like The Imposter, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on a short story. It's about a man who witnesses something unexplainable and must decide how to react to it. Since the short story (which I reviewed here:The Adjustment Bureau) doesn't contain enough for a full-length motion picture, the writers fleshed out the original story and crafted a wonderful treatise on love and self-determination. And it works. Watching it, I was reminded of movie called Made in Heaven where two people search their whole lives for each other because they were in love in Heaven before they were born. That's not exactly what's going on here, but it gives you a flavor. Add the fact that THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU doesn't want them to find each other, and you have a smart, well-paced, science-fiction thriller with a side-order of romance. THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

We love The Very Quiet Cricket, one of Eric Carle's best. It is the story of a very young cricket who wants to talk to the world around him, but he hasn't yet learned how. He rubs and rubs his wings together, but "nothing happens. Not a sound." Until the surprise on the very last page.This is a great end of the day, getting ready for bed book. I read it to my young one in a very soft voice, and she listens very quietly and intently, saying the words under her breath. Even after the most rowdy of days, THIS will quiet her down. And of course, there is always breathless anticipation for the final page...will the cricket finally chirp?The illustrations are very cute, and the simple ideas and repetition of sounds are very intriguing for little ones to follow throughout. This board book is VERY sturdy and stands up to much loving from little hands. And so, far the surprise ending just keeps on ticking...er, chirping.

In anticipation of taking my 3 year old to see The Nutcracker for the very first time, I purchased Vladimir Vagin's THE NUTCRACKER BALLET (which was highly recommended by a friend), so that I could familiarize my daughter with the story. She already recognizes most of the music from The Nutcracker Suite (and can tell you the names of the different pieces!), but I also wanted her to understand the basic story. THE NUTCRACKER BALLET is not only an excellent retelling of the story told in the ballet; it is also quite beautiful to look at.The illustrations in THE NUTCRACKER BALLET are exquisite. They are vivid, colorful, detailed, and drawn from the perspective of a young child. My wee one was drawn to these lovely images; she commented on each one and asked intelligent questions. When we got to the Land of Sweets, she was utterly enchanted. She loved the dancers' clothes, Clara's gown, and of course the Sugar Plum Fairy. The story in THE NUTCRACKER BALLET is simply told. My child was able to follow along easily and understood the story. In fact, even I learned a thing or two about The Nutcracker, and I have seen the ballet countless times!THE NUTCRACKER BALLET really helped my daughter understand and enjoy The Nutcracker on stage. She watched intently, her eyes bright and shining. She loved the music, the dancing, and the story. We had a marvelous time. For anyone planning to attend a performance of The Nutcracker, I highly recommend this book. It will truly add to your child's delight of the event.

NICK OF TIME is the first installment in the An Adventure Through Time series by author Ted Bell. Set in 1939, just prior to the onset of WWII, NICK OF TIME is an excellent tween adventure novel, which can (and should) be enjoyed by all ages. While clearly written to appeal to middle grade boys, NICK OF TIME certainly keep this mother of two (girls) completely entertained. Nazi spies, blood thirsty pirates, and time travel all mix together to keep the reader enthralled and the pages turning.In June of 1939, 12-year-old Nick McIver wants nothing more than to spend his summer on his sail boat, the Stormy Petrel, exploring the coastline and dreaming of adventure. His father is the lighthouse keeper at Greybeard Light, Greybeard Island, England, and Nick and his family actually live in the lighthouse. In fact, his family has been keepers at Greybeard Light for generations. It turns out; however, that Nick's father has a secret life. He's a "birdwatcher," a secret agent searching the Channel for German activity and reporting to Winston Churchill, in direct violation of Prime Minister Chamberlain's orders. On top of this, Nick and his sister Katie find a mysterious sea chest washed up on the shore, which contains a time travel device invented by Leonardo da Vinci, along with note from Nick's ancestor, Captain Nicholas McIver, requesting his help in a sea battle during one of Lord Nelson's famous campaigns! It seems that Nick McIver is about to get more adventure than he ever dreamed.NICK OF TIME is a great fantasy adventure, full of spies, pirates, and science fiction. The writing style is almost formal; reminiscent of the original Hardy Boys (before they were "modernized"). People of all ages are polite, respectful, and take the time to listen to each other, no matter what their age. Yet at the same time, NICK OF TIME is action packed, exciting, and full of mystery.While reading this book, I had this image in my mind of my husband and his two younger brothers as young kids, reading this book aloud to each other, late at night, heads under the covers, with flashlight in hand. It is THAT kind of story, full of mystery and suspense; something that young boys would miss bedtime and risk punishment to keep reading. At least, that is how NICK OF TIME made ME feel.I really enjoyed NICK OF TIME. My one small criticism is that is starts off too slow in the first few chapters. It almost lost me, but luckily, the action picked up somewhere around chapter 4. I am really glad I stuck it out. I will definitely be recommending this to my 13 year old DAUGHTER who loves adventures and even to my 18 year old nephew, who is still not too old for such imaginings. NICK OF TIME is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially if you have adventure in your heart and love of a good story in your soul.

...But can you keep it?CAPRICA is the long awaited prequel to the Sci-Fi channel television series BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. This direct to DVD installment takes place 58 years before the fall of Caprica at the start of the BSG miniseries. My husband and I have been eagerly anticipating the release of CAPRICA, and I must say we both found it very engaging.In this first installment of CAPRICA, we meet the Adamas and the Greystones, two families thrown together in tragedy when their loved ones are killed by a suicide bomber. This unlikely pairing leads to the development of the Cylons (Cybernetic Lifeform Node (who knew?!?)), and to the key turning point in history - the beginning of the story which culminates in BSG.CAPRICA is adult and dark, depicting a society that is out of control (think Roman Empire, just before the fall). Sex, drug, and loss of faith run rampant, and all play a part in the future to come. Eric Stoltz and Esai Morales do an outstanding job as Daniel Greystone and Joseph Adama. It will be interesting to see how these characters and their relationship continue develop in future installments. The cinematography and production values are excellent, but that is to be expected from the BSG folks. The gadgets and gismos are cool and futuristic, and the Cylon is the original model from the series of 30+ years ago. Yea for continuity.I have great hopes that the television series will live up to both BSG and this first look at CAPRICA, and am anxiously awaiting the Sci-Fi channel premier. As the character development deepens and the stories progress, I predict that CAPRICA will please BSG viewers and newbies alike. Well done.

SURVIVORS is another captivating BBC drama that tries to answer the question: What happens when a horrifically virulent plague wipes out 90% of the world's population resulting in total anarchy, lawlessness, and the collapse of civilization? With only two seasons of only 6 episodes each, SURVIVORS keeps you fascinated and wanting more.SURVIVORS is a remake of a 1970's series based on a novel by Terry Nation (the creator of Doctor Who). The series is remarkable in its atmosphere. The horror of mass death, the realization that only 10% of the population is left, the loss of power, transportation, medical care, communication, law, government are all well done and very believable. You really feel for these characters and are completely drawn in. How do you go on when everyone you know has died? How do you continue to survive, when there are no groceries, no clean water, no medicine? And no way to bury the millions of dead bodies...But what is really interesting about SURVIVORS, what really makes it tick, are the characters who are given a second chance at life. SURVIVORS focuses on a small group of very diverse people who are now thrown together in an almost familial unit: Abby (Julie Graham), the matriarch who is determined to find the son she's convinced is still alive; Tom (Max Beesley), the convict who was doing time murder when the virus struck; Anya (Zoe Tapper), the pretty young doctor; Greg (Peterson Joseph), the untrusting loner whose life had already been falling apart; Al (Phillip Rhys), a rich, lazy playboy who can't do anything for himself; and Najid, a devout, 11-year-old Muslim. How has the global tragedy changed them? Can the convict reform? Will the doctor ever practice medicine again, or has she seen too much horror? Will the playboy suddenly grow up? Watching these people, their interactions with each other, and their reactions to both the plague and how to go on is what keeps the audience coming back each espisode. Can they remake themselves? Can they overcome all obstacles and keep on living?My only criticism of SURVIVORS is that the story lines get a bit repetitive after awhile. The "family" doesn't seem to learn from their mistakes from week to week. Hey, it is h-e-double-tooth-picks out there; to really survive these folks need to learn a little faster.Over all, though, SURVIVORS is worth watching. There are a number of continuing story arcs, and luckily, several of them are tied up nicely by the end of season 2. Since the series has, unfortunately, been cancelled, I am very glad that a few things, at least, had been resolved. RECOMMENDED.

The FELLOWES OFFICE COMB BINDING MACHINE is designed to punch rectangular holes in stacks of paper and make it easy to insert a plastic binder into those holes. That's its purpose and that's what it does. I have never used one before, and I was able to make a perfectly bound report on my first attempt. To me, that says it all: a tool that works.The FELLOWES OFFICE COMB BINDING MACHINE seems to be well-constructed and has some nice features like a tray for the binders and another for the non-hanging chads. But here are my dings: first, my unit wobbles. I can't see a reason for it. All four rubber feet are in place and immobile. You can't adjust them. But pushing down on the left front corner lifts the right rear corner. It doesn't impact on the function of the machine, but it's odd. My other ding is the manual. Why is it so hard to write a good manual? I was able to muddle through it, as I said, but the pictures are black and white line drawings with 1 sentence underneath. There are a total of 9. They don't even take up an entire page. I'm all for brevity, but "Insert the plastic comb into the opening mechanism" doesn't help much when the picture is basically the entire front of the machine. They don't show that you have to slide the comb behind the big teeth and rotate it forward so that the little teeth catch it. But as I said, I figured it out.But these annoyances should not prevent you from using The FELLOWES OFFICE COMB BINDING MACHINE to bind your way into your professor's hearts. Once you've bound 1 report, you'll forget all about the manual (which was stapled, not bound, for some reason).

ELPHAME'S CHOICE, is a delightful fantasy-romance. Author P.C. Cast creates a lush and detailed world, interesting and intriguing characters, and an enticing plot. A light and easy read, ELPHAME'S CHOICE captured my imagination and firmly enveloped me in the story.Elphame is different than everyone else; she is the half-human, half-centaur daughter of Etain, the Goddess Encarnate of Epona, and Midhir, the centaur High Shaman. As the first and only human-centaur hybrid, Elphame is a lovely young human woman from the waist up; from the waist down, she resembles a centaur with strong legs ending in hoofs. Because she is so obviously touched by the Goddess, all who see her worship and adore her, but no one, other than her family, sees her as a normal person. Her longing for friends and for acceptance prompts Elphame to seek her destiny in the ruins of Castle MacCallan. The castle calls to her; she knows it is entwined with her fate. But will she find fulfillment and happiness rebuilding Castle MacCallan? Will Ephame finally find acceptance, friendship, and even love?I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed ELPHAME'S CHOICE - I had seen such conflicting reviews. With a quick pace and unique, well developed characters, however, this book was easy for me to sink into. Ms. Cast has developed a real, vibrant, textured world filled with its own history. The wide variety of characters are unique, yet very easy to relate to. This world and its inhabitants came alive for me, and I found that I couldn't put it down.The only negative with ELPHAME'S CHOICE is its marketing as a YA novel. This is an adult fantasy, with several mild yet quite adult scenes. I am not sure why this was released as YA; the main character is around 25, and one character is 125! While this is romantic fantasy, it is adult fantasy, and should be marketed toward adults.Overall, I really liked ELPHAME'S CHOICE, and I am looking forward to the follow on. If you like fantasy, romance, and unusual adventure, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ELPHAME'S CHOICE.

My wee one loves everything Christmas and everything Little Einsteins, so this DVD, LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH, was the perfect Christmas gift for her. She has watched this DVD innumerable times since Christmas, and I know that she will continue to watch it throughout the year. LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH is clearly a new favorite.Like all Little Einsteins DVDs, LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH contains several episodes, one of which had not been previously shown on TV at the time of release. The four episodes include "The Christmas Wish," "The Northern Night Light," "The Wind-Up Toy Prince," and "Show and Tell." As always, each episode contains a featured phrase of classical music and a featured art piece. Music selections from this DVD include Fur Elise, Flight of the Bumble Bee, The Nutcracker Suite, and Carmen Suite No. 1. Art works included are "Starry Night" by Vincent Van Gogh, "The Road in front of Saint-Sim&eacute;on Farm in Winter" by Claude Monet, "Little Dancer" by Edgar Degas, and Mayan architecture.My 3 year old has been watching Little Einsteins since before she could speak, and in our house, they can do no wrong. My child recognizes many classical music pieces and can ask for them by name. She also recognizes many art pieces when she sees them out of her familiar context. She can actually tell me what episode of Little Einsteins she first saw them in. I am constantly amazed and dumbfounded by what she has learned and retained.If you have a Little Einstein lover in your house, then LITTLE EINSTEINS: THE CHRISTMAS WISH is a perfect gift, at any time of year. It will get lots of play, and your kids will learn to recognize and appreciate classical music and beautiful art. Disney has done a remarkable job with this series. Kudos for such quality programming.

The Bodyguard and the Show Dog is Christy Tillery French's second installment in her Bodyguard series. By some bizarre cosmic twist, I am reading this series in reverse order. Fortunately, Ms. French's stories each stand on their own, and I am able to thoroughly enjoy this book on its own merits. Hang on for a wild ride!This book is a fast and fun continuation (in either direction!) of the zany, madcap, e-ticket adventures of protection specialist Natasha Chamberlain, a diminutive, clumsy, danger-prone, feisty, gun-toting, southern girl from Tennessee. This time, Natasha has been hired to protect Chumley, a spoiled, stinky, sex-crazed champion show dog. The scene is impeccably set for the wacky situations that Natasha is (in)famous for, and Ms. French delivers on every page.Although The Bodyguard and the Show Dog is humorous, breezy, summer fun, Ms. French's characters also deal some difficult topics, including animal abuse, with fitting vigilantly justice satisfyingly meted out in true Natasha fashion. Natasha has a strong, well defined moral character, and she always stands up for anyone who cannot stand up for themselves. She delivers apt punishments and has her own special way of dealing with the worst offenders.This book is truly a wild ride, well written, fasted paced, and very, very funny. The characters are endearing, the situations are hilarious, and the love making is hot. What more could you want? I can't think of a thing.

My four year old daughter and I just watched TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE, the second of the new Tinker Bell stories, and I must say that Disney has hit another home run with this film. I really don't understand why these films are going straight to DVD. I think Disney would make a fortune releasing these movies in the theatres. My daughter was completely entranced by TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE, and I must admit, I found myself with a happy grin on my face throughout the entire movie. The TINKER BELL movies are, by far, some of the best films, animated or not, to come out of the Disney Studios in a long time. They are sweet, pure, and have lovely messages.In TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE, Tink is given a very special task to help celebrate the Autumn Revelry. Because Tink is one of the most talented tinker fairies ever born, this very high honor falls to her. But our Tink is feisty, impetuous, and emotional, and things do go dreadfully wrong, possibly putting the future of Pixie Hollow and all fairies everywhere at risk. Tink tries to solve her problems all on her own, but soon learns that true friends, both old and new, are more important than anything else.The animation in TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE is as magnificent as it was in the first film. The colors are rich and brilliant, the action smooth and clean, and the characterizations are delightful and loveable. The voice talent was cherry-picked from some of the best. Mae Whitman, who voices Katara in the AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER series, continues to be a perfect choice for Tink. Charming and sincere, she is conveys Tinker Bell perfectly. The talents of Kristin Chenoweth, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Jessie McCartney, Raven-Symone, and a host of others add to the pleasure of this film. And, as in the previous film, there is nothing particularly scary in TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE; nothing that will frighten or upset children. No one dies; no one is particularly evil; there is no bad language. A bad temper, a fight with a friend, and, yes, a stomped foot...but that is the worst of it. From start to finish, TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE is cute, appealing, and captivating.TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE is another new sentimental favorite; this series just makes me feel all happy and gooey inside, and that is a wondrous thing in today's crazy world. I am going to sit down with my wee one, and watch this one again soon. My child in my lap and a joyful family film can certainly cure almost any bad day.

The HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER is exactly what I have been looking for! I am short and (to use my 5 year old's word) have a large bosom. Even with the sliding seatbelt adjustment now available on most cars, the shoulder belt has always hit me in the neck instead of across the collarbone and shoulder. Not only is this uncomfortable, - it results in rubbing and chaffing on my neck - it is also dangerous and could cause potentially fatal injury during a crash, if the seat belt were to tighten and lock across my neck.However, the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER is a brilliant little solution to that particular problem. It is made of heavy duty plastic, small, and fairly easy to use. First, you clip the bracket on to the lap belt. This bracket is very sturdy and quite secure. I know because I clipped it together before putting it on the seat belt, just to see how it worked. It took my husband applying a whole lot of force with a pocket knife to get it unclipped again! Next, you hook the shoulder strap into the bracket tongue (which should be facing down). Finally, you slide the bracket into a comfortable position. As you do, the bracket pulls the lap and shoulder belts together across your hips, pulling the shoulder belt away from your neck and across your shoulder. Exactly what I wanted!There are a couple of tricks, however, to using the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER. If you read the instructions, the bracket should be NO MORE THAN THREE INCHES AWAY from the seat belt buckle. Sliding it further than that causes that lap belt to ride up and the bracket to dig into your belly. This you do not want. Also, if you cinch your lap belt tightly across your hips before adjusting the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER, the lap belt will be more likely to stay on your hips, rather than your belly. Then, if you do what the picture on the packaging shows, and fold the shoulder strap back on itself, the shoulder strap will lie flat and tight across your shoulder and stay away from your neck.I really like the HEININGER AUTOMOTIVE 1027 COMMUTEMATE SEAT BELT STRAP ADJUSTER. It does everything I want and comes two to a package, so you can put one in each car. But it gets only 4 stars because of the quirky tricks needed to make it work right and for the poorly written, incomplete directions.

I have no idea why the critics panned JULIE & JULIA. My husband and I saw it the other evening, and found it to be absolutely delightful. In fact, it was one of the best movies we've seen in a long time. But be forewarned. You will be very hungry by the end of JULIE & JULIA. You will want something to eat, preferably, something with lots of butter.JULIE & JULIA is actually two stories, expertly blended together, each complimenting the other, and creating dish that is more than the sum of its ingredientsThe first story told in JULIE & JULIA is the delicious present day story of Julia Powell, a young woman who feels that her life is going nowhere, especially when she compares herself to her high-powered friends. Julie really wants to make a name for herself as a writer, but instead is a low level administrator who answers the phone all day long, receiving complaints and sob stories. Jealousy and frustration with her life really come to the forefront when she finds out that one of her less talented, but high flying friends is writing an internet blog about her own life that people seem to be reading. So Julie decides to give herself a challenge: She will take one year and cook her way through Julia Child's famous cookbook. As she goes, she will blog about it - 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Kitchen. At first, the only reader seems to be her mother, who is extremely less than supporting. But, along the way, she garners a world of fans and supporters all cheering her on to complete her goal.JULIE & JULIA's second story is that of Julia Child herself: her life abroad with her beloved and loving husband, her search for herself, her journey through French cooking school, her desire but inability to have a child, her cookbook, and her television show. This is a touching, tender love story - Julia's love for her husband, her love of food and cooking, and her love of life. Never one to let obstacles get in her way, Julia lives her life to the fullest with great gusto, enthusiasm, and love.These two stories in JULIE & JULIA are artfully blended together, with Julie's present day scenes intermingling with Julia's from the 1940's. Most of the time, the lives of these two women seem to mirror each other, making both stories even more connected and meaningful. The acting by Amy Adams (as Julie) and Stanley Tucci (as Julia's husband Paul) is outstanding and memorable, but it is Meryl Streep as Julia Child who brilliantly steals the show. After we watched JULIE & JULIA, my husband found all of Julia Child's cooking shows available on PBS. We have watched several, and Ms. Streep perfectly portrayed Ms. Child to a tee. Her performance, in a word, is brilliant.JULIE & JULIA is a charming, relaxing, engaging film, just right for a warm, cuddly evening at home. It will also make you want to eat, and perhaps, it will inspire you to cook. It did me. Bon Apetit!

I have really been enjoying the Southern Vampire Mysteries. They are pure fun; a guilty pleasure. And DEAD TO THE WORLD is no exception. In fact, DEAD TO THE WORLD kicks it up a notch, adding even more adventure and romance to this kooky, off beat series.For those who have been out of the solar system for the past few years, Sookie Stackhouse is a telepathic waitress from southern Louisiana who just wants to be "normal." Unfortunately, Sookie suffers from a case of perpetual bad luck as well as a knack for attracting supernatural friends and enemies. In DEAD TO THE WORLD, Sookie's former lover, known as Bill the Vampire, has run off to Peru to do research, and Bill boss, Eric, the local vampire sheriff, has lost his memory and sense of who he is. Sookie falls for this new, and possibly improved, Eric hook, line, and sinker. She knows that eventually he will return to his old self, but, quite frankly, she doesn't care. Sookie's brother, Jason has also gone missing, and now she must find him, help Eric, and defeat a coven of blood thirsty wicked witches, all on her own.It is always fun to read about Sookie's paranormal, wacky adventures and her romantic tribulations, and the need to suspend your disbelief makes this series just that much more enjoyable. DEAD TO THE WORLD and the rest are good old fashioned entertainment, designed wash away your cares and to brighten your day. You can sink yourself into Sookie's world; Charlaine Harris's light-hearted writing style makes it easy, and always leaves you wanting more.DEAD TO THE WORLD mixes things up a bit and ups the stakes (don't pardon the pun!). DEAD TO THE WORLD is a must for Sookie fans. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Honestly, I've forgotten most of SURROGATES already. Let me see what I can dredge up. Bruce Willis is an FBI agent in a future where almost everyone has a tele-operated robotic double. These robots are called SURROGATES, and they can look however you want them to look. Bruce's looks younger and has Don Johnson's hair. The idea is that no one leaves home anymore. Their SURROGATES do that. So when Bruce's surrogate takes a bullet, no sweat. It's just a robot. Only someone has a weapon that fry both the surrogate and the operator. Bruce has to stop him.But, the problem is that SURROGATES is boring, and you see the ending coming miles and miles away. It felt like the David Brin novel, The Kiln People, although in that book, the SURROGATES were disposable clones. But the stories are similar.To call SURROGATES science fiction is really just a technicality. The premise certainly is Sci-Fi, but their future looks awfully contemporary. And there was no guessing who the final five were - EVERYONE was a robot. Or so we're told. There were no outward signs of that. They didn't even append an `r' to the front of their names.I have managed to remember more, but it was hardly worth the effort. SURROGATES is a movie to watch when there is nothing else on. NOT RECOMMENDED.

Let's be clear. BLACK SWAN is not a movie about dance or about romance. To say the least, BLACK SWAN is creepy, disturbing, and very strange. It tries to be a horror flick on one level, and a psychological thriller on another. Unfortunately, it fails miserably on both.Don't get me wrong, BLACK SWAN is horrific, and, yes, I do understand what the director was trying to do. In many ways, it reminded me of the 1979 film "All That Jazz," a bizarre and intimate look at choreographer Bob Fosse's life and his descent into drugs, sexual escapades, and near death experiences. As with "All That Jazz," BLACK SWAN plays like an acid trip gone bad...very, very bad. You are never quite sure what is real, what is hallucination, or what is really going on.BLACK SWAN takes us back stage during a new, re-envisioned production of Swan Lake. Ballerina Nina (Natalie Portman) has snagged the leading role of the White Swan, which is perfect for her delicate and shy personality. At the same time, she must also play the Black Swan and bring a sexier, wilder personality to life. The stress of it all is too much for Nina, and she slowly begins to spiral into madness. By the end she no longer has any idea as to what is real and what is not.The problem is, neither do we. For the most part, the characterizations are flat and clich&eacute;d. Natalie Portman whispers throughout the film and is very difficult to understand. Barbara Hershey is empty and cardboard as her mother trying to live vicariously through her daughter. The director/choreographer, played by Vincent Cassel, is a stereotypical jerk who will do anything to get the performance he wants. The shining exception in BLACK SWAN is Mila Kunis as a newcomer to the company who is selected to be Nina's understudy. She does more acting, and quite good at that, than the rest of the cast combined, including Winona Ryder as the wacked out, aging prima ballerina.Other bright spots in BLACK SWAN include Tchaikovsky's brilliant Swan Lake score, which plays in gorgeous counterpoint to the action on screen, the exquisite dance sequences, and some very impressive and unexpected CGI. However, these highlights are not enough for me to recommend BLACK SWAN. And while the ending does leave you gasping, it is not in a good way. I guess I don't want to be shaking my head at the end of a film.As a side note: I really don't every need to see an actor or actress pleasuring themselves on screen. Especially not multiple times. And especially not Natalie Portman. TMI.

WOW! really sums up TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH. Audiences around the world will be held spellbound by this dark and horrifying miniseries. I watched most of the episodes back-to-back - straight through in one sitting. TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH kept me on the edge of my seat with a fantastic story, a break-neck pace, and heart-pounding suspense and tension.TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH does exactly what all truly excellent science fiction does; it makes us question what it means to be human; question our own actions, words, and deeds. In TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH, brilliant writer Russell T. Davies asks and answers the question "Do the needs of the many out weight the needs of the few, or the one?" And the answer is shocking, gut-wrenching, and absolutely heart-breaking.The premise of TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is truly every parent's worst nightmare - completely unimaginable except in our most horrific dreams. The politicians portrayed here are the true monsters of the story, not the aliens (although they are a pretty dodgy crowd, themselves.) The "scenarios" batted about the political leaders are disgusting. It shows how little faith they have in human beings and the world.The British have never been afraid to kill off main characters, change the direction of a beloved series, or recast a leading roll. In many cases, this philosophy can infuse a series with new vigor, new fans, and better plot lines. TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is no exception. We have lost main characters before and most likely will do so in the future. Dr. Who, Primeval, Hex, and many other successful British series have gone through similar transformations.Finally, IMHO, Captain Jack fans have nothing to fear. He has gone on intergalactic walk-about before, and he has always come back, once he has resolved what he needs to resolve. This one may take more time...a lot more time... but I believe he will return. Gwen will carry on until he is ready - that is what she does. Maybe with the help of Lois Habiba, who would be a nice a very addition to the cast. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

OLIVER BUTTON IS A SISSY, by Tomie dePaola, is a very special book. Aimed at young children (but meaningful at any age), OLIVER BUTTON IS A SISSY tells the story of a little boy, Oliver, who doesn't what to do "normal" boy things. He isn't very athletic, but he likes to walk in the woods, draw pictures, wear costumes and put on plays, read, and most of all, Oliver loves to dance. His parents enroll him in a dance class, "...for the exercise," says his father. The other boys tease him and call him names. The girls have to come to his rescue. But Oliver practices and practices his dancing. In the end, even though he does not win the local talent show, everyone realizes that Oliver is special. Oliver Button is a star.This book has a lot of meaning for my best friend and me, and I am thrilled that I am able to share it with my daughters, ages 11 and 3. Both of them have enjoyed reading this book with me over the years. I have heard the older one reading it to the younger one, because she (the older one) likes it so much. Currently, it is on the wee one's list of frequently asked for books. I asked my three year old why she likes it so much. "Because, Mommy, Oliver loves all of the things I do, he tries hard like me, and he can be anything he wants, just like me. He is my friend." My amazing child is very astute. She has gotten everything that I could want her to out of this story. Do what you love, do your best, don't listen to peer pressure, be who you are...and you will succeed. We are all unique, all gifted, all special. That is the very special, very important message of OLIVER BUTTON IS A SISSY."If I believe it, I can be anything, anything at all."

There is not a lot to say. These are very nice brushes. They are well contructed, and they do an excellent job cleaning my cast iron pan. We need to replace them about once a year, but they are inexpensive, and well worth it.

PRIMEVAL is the latest in string of hit science fiction shows imported from the UK. Currently showing on BBC America, this little gem is a grand mix of time travel, dinosaurs, futuristic monsters, government intrigue, conspiracy theory, and a splash of romance. Toss in a light dash of camp, and you have an extremely entertaining new television show.PRIMEVAL was created to compete against the enormously successful DOCTOR WHO. IMHO, sci-fi lovers will find room in their hearts for both shows. The basic premise of the show is that there are portals in time, called anomalies, which are popping up all over England. Strange creatures keep wandering through into the present - raptors, giant worms, bugs, pterodactyls, leviathans, wooly mammoths, even creatures from the future. Of course, we must find out what is going and Professor Nick Cutter and his team of evolutionary biologists are called in. Some riddles are solved each week, but as with any good series, new questions continue to arise.The script and dialogue are quite good and believable, the acting very enjoyable and well done, and the special effects just excellent and created by the same people who did Walking with Dinosaurs. And staying true to standard time travel lore, what you do in the past DOES impact the present, sometimes in shocking ways. Can the present be put right? Tune in each week to find out.As an added bonus, this show is rated PG and is suitable for children about age 8 and up.Each of series one and series two are just six episodes in length, and each ends with a significant (and frustrating!!!) cliff hanger. I don't know about you, but I sure am hooked. I am eagerly anticipating series 3.

...and mine, too! We have been reading this story for two Christmases now, and my toddler just loves it. She wants it every evening during the Christmas season. At 2 1/2, she can quote the book almost verbatim. It is truly one of the sweetest stories I have ever read, with a wonderful message. I recommended it to my daughter's preschool teacher, who then read it to the class. This book just makes you feel, warm, happy, and full of love. I have purchased additional copies to keep (as ours is getting very well loved!) and to share.
