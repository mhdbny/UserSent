Remembering this as a true period piece in film, "Stormy Weather", nonetheless is both delightful and difficult to view. It's standard black stereotyping does nothing to enhance a miserable plot and bad acting. Yet, performances by Fats Waller, Cab Calloway, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and the impressive Nicholas brothers are wonderful. Lena Horne, sings her signature piece, "Stormy Weather", of course. If one can get past the dialogue, there is much merit in the film.

"American Theocracy", the startling new book by longtime Republican Kevin Phillips, details a pessimistic view of the United States today and an even less rosy picture for the future. Phillips writes what an increasing number of Americans think.....the country is being run by religious right-wingers who have far too much power. Garnering and presenting facts and figures, Phillips is one to listen to as he also knows a thing or two about prognostication....he's been deadly accurate before.It's refreshing to hear Phillips as he weaves together histories of Spain, Holland and Britain, how their empires grew and ultimately collapsed and their collective comparison to the United States today. The author centers on three areas about which Americans should be very concerned....our over-reliance on oil, our soaring debt and the frightening new religious base of the Republican party.Phillips says that the connection of oil to the invasion of Iraq was one of the most underrated stories of the war. As George Bush would have liked it, the oil wells of Iraq would be under American control by now and we would be dictating who got Iraqi oil and how much it would cost. The immense failure of the Bush team in Iraq is but one of a plethora of disasters brought on by the current administration. Phillips, an ardent foe of the Bush "dynasty", mirrors the view of a majority of Americans who feel that Bush is inept. He minces no words about it, either.The author is good at relating how and why the debt is a growing problem. The loss of manufacturing as a basic tool in the American economy has been replaced by finance. As he points out, certain preceding empires (the ones mentioned above) all began with agriculture as an economic base and proceeded through to climaxes which ended in reliance on finance. He speaks of "rentier cultures"...("rentier" being a French word that means a person living off unearned income... the United States now having a myriad of people in that category) as one sign of an empire's doomed fate.Regarding religion, (the last of the three areas upon which Phillips discusses) the mainline Republican party of a generation ago went south, turned hard right and discovered religion. The fringe elements became the core and made the present-day Republican party the first truly religious party in our history. Here Phillips gets most impassioned, and for good reason...the anti-science, pro-faith, Armageddon-waiting fundamentalists have stripped the once middle-of-the-road Republican party of their respectability. The dangers, he reminds us, are that this new core of Republicans are in control of all three branches of government. They've caused havoc already and haven't ceased yet."American Theocracy" sometimes has a textbook feel to it as Phillips writes as he sounds on tv.....informative, but dry. What he has to say, though, however provocative, should be a wake-up call to those millions of Americans who want to turn the country around. I highly recommend this book for its forthright message and terrific insight.

"The Line of Beauty" is the first novel I've read by Alan Hollinghurst and having just finished it I'll make a beeline to read his others. Every chapter of this book is a sheer delight.There are few authors who can move a book at such a torturedly slow pace and still manage a success. The key to "The Line of Beauty" lies in the detail....Hollinghurst unfolds his characters with enormous pathos, keeping their quotes brief and allowing his observations about them to become expanded. Their is a dryness to his writing that seems endemic of British authors but remaining in that style allows the flavor of his characters to come through with great shades of color.As told through the eyes of the protagonist, Nick, Hollinghurst is able to steer him through a feel that combines an Edwardian England with the present. Nick grows up, to be sure, but he does so in a wafting way, sensitive to the world and his growing self-awareness. If Nick wears rose-colored glasses in the beginning, he has neatly discarded them at the end."The Line of Beauty" is really a book about connections...connections in a changing world of friends, lovers, family, illness and death. There is a general sadness that accompanies this book, as it should. Alan Hollinghurst reminds us, through the seriousness of Nick's story, how tenuous we all are in each other's care, no matter what our "standing" is in society... and how far we still have to go.

Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead, revisited" is a masterpiece of twentieth century literature. Spanning a period of twenty years, Waugh paints a most extraordinary picture of idyllic life fraught with undertones of deep sadness. Charles Ryder serves as the incarnate narrator of Waugh's halcyon brush strokes as Ryder emerges as the most critcal character in the book.The women of "Brideshead" are either self-absorbed or flitty and the men are sillier yet. In fact, the second half of Waugh's work is more important than the first. In the latter half, Charles matures....the only person to do so. It is as if Charles is holding a movie camera throughout as the characters rotate in slow motion. They rarely move forward....just on to other locations. Waugh's greatest contribution is, however, his soft hintings of sexuality. These connections are largely left open to the reader's imagination and are gently manipulated by the feel of a warm breeze, the sight of a flower-filled field or the scent of spring.A question I often asked myself while reading "Brideshead" was "are these people really connecting in any way?" My answer was "yes", but at a distance more relevant to the times and to the country. Charles's denouement was a curtain being pulled down on a dysfunctional family that had little real understanding of how to hold themselves together, but did so, anyway."Brideshead, revisited" can be read in a short time but, like an afternoon tea, should be consumed in small sips. The refreshment of Evelyn Waugh's descriptive prose evinces a master mind at work...the author turned painter. His canvas is a tour de force.

This extremely well-written and well-paced book should be an inspiration to all as we approach the first anniversary of that tragic day. Written with great care and with an eye to the families of the dead, Jere Longman has woven together the lives of these men and women with the minutes of the tragedy of their final flight. Not only do we get to know the passengers but Longman also gives us a full chapter about the hijackers....after all, they were part of the picture, too. And in graphic detail he minces no words when it comes to the plane crash and aftermath itself.The author's narrative spins back and forth between the passengers, their histories, their families and the actual time of flight......the final hijacking segment lasted a mere half hour. During that time numerous phone calls were made from the plane to loved ones....some saying good-bye, some expressing fear, some calmness.....all apprehensive. I'm a little uncomfortable about the author's discussion with regard to the word heroes, however. Certainly there were brave people on that flight who attempted to right the hijacker's wrong and in doing so gave up their lives and saved many other lives on the ground. But the word "hero" has become a little confusing these days. Would people who were certain their plane would go down in a thunderstorm as it raced toward a populated area be called heroes after their plane crashed? Was everyone on United flight 93 a hero? I understand the sensitivity of this particular flight and how it affected us as a nation, but I still wonder about that word and its usage.This book should be read by everyone. I highly recommend it and commend the author, Jere Longman, for his ability to tell this story in a way that is unnerving and comforting.

Rutherford B. Hayes has always ended up in the middle of presidential ratings, and Hans L. Trefousse's taut biography of our nineteenth president would not move him up or down that list. Trefousse does a good job in assessing President Hayes as a man and as an administrator, though "comprehensive" is not a word used to describe the biographies in this American Presidents' series.The remarkable ascendency of Hayes to the presidency after the disputed election of 1876 has parallels to the election of 2000, but Trefousse (with an apparent dig at George W. Bush) elevates Hayes by suggesting that Hayes tried to bring together various warring factions while Bush did not. It's a good reflection. Hayes's stellar service during the Civil War, in which the future president was wounded more than once, is covered in great detail by the author. (Because of the quiet nature of the four years Hayes spent in the White House, this book needed some "fleshing out"). We know that Hayes was honest and his administration was largely beneficial to the country. I view his term as something akin to Gerald Ford's...a transitional time where the country needed healing. In fact Hayes's biggest accomplishment was the removal of Federal troops from the South, meaning an end to Reconstruction. That is the chief legacy of the Hayes administration. The president was also big on civil service reform, taken to higher limits by Chester Arthur a few years later. It's a fascinating reminder that Indian affairs still took up some of the President's time, but what is one of the more notable aspects of this book is how often and how much President Hayes traveled while in office and in retirement. He was the first president to visit the West Coast, for example.Rutherford B. Hayes served adequately and he should be remembered for a solid four years in office, if not much more. There certainly have been worse presidents but Trefousse justifiably gives Hayes credit for some accomplishments and I recommend this book as a good introduction to our nineteenth president.

I first read of the devastation that smallpox wrought on the Continental Army while reading David McCullough's terrific biography, "John Adams" and was lucky enough to have seen, subsequently, "Pox Americana" author Elizabeth Fenn delve more deeply into the topic on cable TV's C-Span "Booknotes." Professor Fenn has written a well-researched book on smallpox....one that is not only informative, but generally easily readable.This is really two books. The first half covers the trail of Variola (smallpox) transmission throughout the course of the American Revolution and in this first half, Ms. Fenn writes with a prose that captures the reader with graphic details of the harshness of the disease itself, the suffering of those who were unlucky enough to have caught it, and the fear that became a constant in the lives of not only those who fought militarily but those in the civilian ranks as well. She gives us facts about how the smallpox incubates, how long it takes to run its course and how it was so easily transmittable. The reader can almost hear the agony of those inflicted and see the smallpox spread over their bodies. Ms. Fenn points to a tie-in (also in the McCullough book) that it is very likely that the British had tried to use the transmission of smallpox from their more disease-tolerant armies to the weaker American ones as an example of the first "germ warfare" thrust upon our newly independent country. The fact that George Washington had the timely sense (and good fortune) to inoculate his army during the winter of 1777, thus proving it to be a turning point in the war, is a remarkable story in itself....not one I'm sure that most students learn in school!The narrative in the second half of "Pox Americana" is weaker. Ms. Fenn, while continuing to do a superb in-depth job at following the disease around North America (mostly through Indian tribes), loses her descriptive appeal. The book now becomes more of an encyclopedia of numbers of deaths, which tribe could have passed it to which other one, and so on. At points we are inundated by the vast numbers of tribes and without the help of some elementary-looking maps, the reader can quite easily get lost. Still, the author has put forth her research at a compelling depth. I wonder now that Ms. Fenn has written this book, is there another book in her future which keeps the more fascinating Revolutionary War aspect and includes all different types of diseases that may have hit the colonists? She would be just the one to write it.

Seth Mnookin has written a sensational book regarding the downfall of two employees of the New York Times in 2003 and the sullied reputation for which the Times has fought hard to atone. The story revolves around an aspiring reporter, Jayson Blair, who finally got caught plagiarizing many columns while inventing others, and Howell Raines, the Darth Vader of the journalism world. If there ever was a boss one wouldn't want to have, Mnookin shows us that Raines was that man.The larger element is the world of the Times, the most important and influential newspaper in the world. Mnookin has a way with narrative and for those of us who have grown up with the Times he reveals the underside of a finished product. Like the old saying, "the two things no one wants to see made are laws and sausages", the author spins a chilling tale of how the incidents with Blair and the heavy-handedness of Raines brought the Times to its knees. When you read the Times on a daily basis it's sometimes hard to believe what goes on behind their closed doors. Mnookin takes us inside that world and reveals a site of petty politics, bruised egos, ambitious reporters and a workplace that often borders on the chaotic. There are good and bad people in this book.I highly recommend "Hard News". It's so good that once you get into it, you'll find it hard to put down.

George McGovern has always been a voice of reason and it's good to see he's still around and speaking out about things that are great about America and things at which cause us concern as a nation. You won't find many neocons reading "The Essential America" because they've "written" their own book on this country...and gotten us into a lot of trouble because of it. McGovern points out that so much of America's spending is in non-productive areas....much of it in defense that has produced us with little tangible results over the past fifty years. He rightly concludes that the current president and his ilk in Washington have not made the United States any safer in the world, but more vulnerable, given the needless foray into Iraq and the even larger question of the uneven tilt toward Israel. We'll be paying the price for those mistakes for ages to come.Senator McGovern speaks of his war service in this book but does so humbly and with many references about what patriotism should be. He reminds us of the hollow phrase, "America...love it or leave it" and echoes his own words from 1972...."let us change America, so we can love it the more." I hope this is a fitting prelude to the defeat of George Bush in November...or to put it more liberally...erasing America's mistake. "The Essential America" provides a ringing endorsement of the liberal tradition in this country and it is a book that is definitely worth the read.

Reading Whitey Ford's &quot;Few and Chosen&quot; is like listening to him....soft-spoken with a twinkle in his eye. This is a book you can pick up and put down and not miss much. The stories are usually short (sometimes too short) and the anecdotes are just about what you'd expect to hear from &quot;The Chairman of the Board&quot;.I appreciate Whitey Ford's honesty with regard to players who preceded him. He doesn't comment on them much because he didn't see them play. Still, he gives what impressions he has. After reading Tim McCarver's disappointing and overworked &quot;Perfect Season&quot; several years ago, &quot;Few and Chosen&quot; is like a breath of fresh air.There are a few new facts (new to me, anyway) that come out in his book, like the small numbers of home runs hit by players before Babe Ruth. Things of this nature help to make baseball more interesting to many of us.Whitey Ford pitched the first baseball game I ever saw in 1963. I'm glad he's still around to pass on his observations to us.

"Spellbound" is exactly how this film leaves you. I've rarely been so focused on a group of people we get to know early on as they prepare for the National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C. in 1999. Coming from all walks of life and from different economic classes, they have at least one thing in common...intensity.The first half of "Spellbound" is dedicated to being introduced to the eight kids on which the film is based...their families, friends and teachers all provide a loving (and often nail biting) bond with these present and future competitors. But it is the second half where everything comes together. There's more drama here than in most action movies and it is a winner of a film on many different levels.I highly recommend "Spellbound". It's a timeless wonder... warm, sometimes funny, occasionally heartbreaking but always satisfying. These kids and their families teach us a good deal about love, learning, and competition. You'll be spellbound.

Joseph J. Ellis's new biography of George Washington, "His Excellency", gives us an intriguing insight into the mind and actions of our first president. Washington does, indeed, remain the most enigmatic of the founding fathers and Ellis explains Washington in ways both his contemporaries and succeeding generations regarded him. To this end, the author succeeds.Like Washington himself, Ellis's book matures with each turn of the page. I was ready to give the book four stars until being reminded that Washington should be considered the best president ever...if he hadn't set up the historical precedents he had, the country would not have turned out the way we have. Thanks to Washington, subsequent presidents have been able to follow a remarkable guide.Ellis begins his narrative with Washington as a young soldier in the French and Indian wars and determinedly leads the reader through Washington's service during the American Revolution and ultimately, as president. For some this might not be new ground, but it is reassuring to know how much the United States could not have gotten off the ground had Washington not been in the middle of events. If he was indeed stoic and reserved, Ellis points out that Washington was also passionate and had times of angry outbursts....not uncommon for a man with his disposition.There are many pages in "His Excellency" devoted to Washington's thoughts and deeds regarding slavery...one of the more fascinating aspects of the book. Torn between idealism and realism, Washington's thinking was years ahead of those around him, even though he thought that ending slavery would be a divisive issue in the fragile nature of the new union.In summing up Washington, Ellis produces one sentence that leapt out at me when I read it. He says, "his remarkably reliable judgment derived from his elemental understanding of how power worked in the world". That judgment, with all the balancing acts that Washington had to do, is perhaps his overriding achievement after all. I recommend "His Excellency" to all who want to have a fresh look at the man who was "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen".

"Longtime Companion", the first full-length chronicle of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, remains as fresh a look today as when it was made in 1990. Beginning with the discovery of a "gay cancer" in 1981, the film follows a group of loosely-knit friends on a year-to-year basis throughout the decade, and does so with empathy and humor. There are many fine performances, including a moving one by a young Campbell Scott."Longtime Companion" seeks to reflect but also to educate, reminding viewers that the deaths of these friends held meaning not only for their intimates but for the larger community as well. AIDS may not make the headlines it once did, but it still warrants a good deal of medical attention through research and human consideration for those who have the disease. It would be fascinating if an updated "Longtime Companion" could ever be made.

The recent untimely death of actor Heath Ledger prompted me to take a look at the films in which he has appeared. That search led me to "Monster's Ball"....an early Ledger film from 2001. It's a tour de force with Halle Berry leading an excellent cast. Though Ledger appears relatively briefly, his character plays an integral role in the drama and he does a superb job.A chance encounter with deep consequences between Berry (Leticia) and Billy Bob Thornton (Hank) turns the racial divide on its ears in the modern-day south. Both have loved ones who die tragic deaths and while their connections take time to unravel, the film plays out in a masterful way with race, seduction and ultimately love playing significant parts. The understated score helps the action unfold and the coming together of Berry and Thornton are handled in an extraordinarily effective manner.With Peter Boyle playing Thronton's racist and dying father, the cast of "Monster's Ball" takes an inventive plot and turns it into a film full of depth and understanding. It's one not to be missed.

It took me two years to see "The Aristocrats" at last but it was worth every minute of the wait. The premise is simple but the expansiveness of the film is what it's all about and the creativity is two-fold. Not only are so many of the individual segments of the re-telling of this old joke imaginative but the real genius is the movie itself. Well-paced and well-timed, it's a great deal of fun. As one comedian put it, "it's where your darkest place can go". Apparently it can go very far in all of us...and there's always "the rusty trombone" for an extra laugh!

Author Jonathan Eig has written a nice tribute to the player they called "The Iron Horse", Lou Gehrig. Gehrig would have stood out in his life and career, anyway, but his tragic, early death made him that much more of an attractive and historic figure in baseball.The first two thirds of "Luckiest Man" describe Gehrig as a shy but pleasant sort of person....the antithesis of Babe Ruth. That the two men ever got along is astonishing. Gehrig's closeness to his mother is revealing, but not surprising, given the make-up of his character. Yet Eig's narrative here is ploddy and uninspiring. Turning the pages in this part of the book is not something one does grippingly.However, the final chapters of "Luckiest Man" suddenly come alive as Gehrig begins to confront his disease and his destiny. Eig's narrative changes....the sentences become longer and his words take on a propelling force. The author's description of "Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day" at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 fills in many of the gaps for those of us who have seen the few snippets of film from that day. Best of all, Gehrig's conversations and letters to his doctors at the Mayo Clinic, especially Dr. Paul O'Leary, have a poignant quality and Eig begs the question, "to what extent did the doctors tell Gehrig that his demise was most likely to occur?" and "how much could Gehrig surmise about his own condition?" These questions make a central, compelling case to read "Luckiest Man".

Thad Carhart has written a breezy and easily readable book about pianos, Paris and people. It's the kind of book you might consider taking in on a rainy day (if you're "down") or better yet, on a warm day sitting in the sun.I'm a pianist who found the nicest parts of "The Piano Shop" had to do with the people the author encountered.... my favorite was Jos, the overly-boozed piano tuner, though I did appreciate Carhart's insights into piano construction, reconstruction and the musical elements that are essential in completing the package of what goes into making a fine piano. He introduced me to a term I had never encountered..."fall board" (the piano key lid).My one objection is the author's continued "over fascination" with pianos. It really sounds more like a fetish and if he had been able to tone down that part of the book he would have had a more compelling story. Still, it's a book to be recommended, as I heartily do.

Every few years, it seems, historians offer a new round of rating US presidents. It's fun to see how contemporary changes affect the ratings' outcome and with this new book, &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; it's time to take note that James Buchanan has replaced Warren G. Harding as the worst president in the nation's history. Appendix 1, where the comparisons are listed and discussed, is a fresh approach and gives a different tilt as to how presidents are judged. The problem with &quot;Presidential Leadership&quot; is that this section is the only redeeming part of the book.Had the editors stayed with this as their main thrust the book would have been better. But it centers around thumbnail sketches of almost all of our presidents (William Henry Harrison and James A. Garfield are not rated because of the short tenures of their presidencies and George W. Bush because his White House years have not yet been completed) that are vastly incongruant and often irrelevant. On the face of things it might seem to have been a good thing to ask men and women of different political persuasions and backgrounds to write about certain presidents but because there are so many different authors the book lacks cohesiveness. The chapter on John Adams barely mentions his presidency at all and to have Peggy Noonan write about John F. Kennedy is like asking Maureen Dowd to write about George W. Bush.The most disturbing part comes in the sections about presidential leadership. (which follow the mini-biographies) Though of a generally conservative bent they nonetheless were written several months ago before the American public began to turn against our involvement in Iraq. The writing reflects the earlier public support and, in judging Bush at that time, seems no longer relevant. Victor Davis Hanson's view that &quot;George W. Bush made it clear from the outset that the mission of the American military in Iraq during the 2003 war was the removal of Saddam Hussein&quot; is a tenuous statement at best. The administration's reasons for invading kept changing so it was anything but clear.There are some technical mistakes as well (I counted five regarding dates...see John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, Calvin Coolidge and two regarding William McKinley) so it appears this book was hastily edited. What could have been a finer achievement had it been written by one author with a focus on that wonderful Appendix 1 regarding the rating of presidents, it would have been a very good book. Sadly, it is not.

After a recent visit to the DDR (GDR) Museum in Berlin I came home to watch "The Lives of Others", an incredibly well-constructed film regarding the Stasi and its operations and intimidation techniques in the GDR before the fall of the wall. The film, suspenseful from beginning to end, patched together everything I had just seen abroad. It's a remarkable piece of work."The Lives of Others" is no more sinister than real life had been in the East for decades. Central to the cast is Ulrich M&uuml;he as a Stasi operator, whose job is to expose the actions of an accomplished theater director. The entanglements that ensue play out vividly and M&uuml;he (recently deceased) gives a stunning performance. The actor's own personal contributions to the fall of the wall in 1989 give his performance an added measure of poignancy. Those familiar with life in East Germany twenty years ago will also note the presence of the "Trabis" (Trabants) in the film...the car that became synonymous with that time and place.This film is important in another way as I see some of those rights denied individuals in "The Lives of Others" being chipped away in America today. It is a stark reminder of how precious freedom is and how societies can change almost without notice. At one point in the film, a young man blurts out a joke "disrespectful" of the current president, Erich Honecker. Unfortunately for him, senior Stasi officials overhear him. That moment summed up "The Lives of Others" for me. I highly recommend it.

It's one thing to hold the coveted job of restaurant critic for the New York Times but it's an entirely different matter when that person can deliver such a wonderfully breezy book about her experiences. Ruth Reichl has done just that in a style that is as warm, informative and delicious as the best restaurants she has reviewed.In "Garlic and Sapphires" the author invites you into her world so intimately that you feel you are sharing each and every meal with her. It would probably have been enough if Ruth had simply given us a compilation of her entire collected reviews because she writes so well in that vein, but the joy of this particular offering includes a cast of characters who are not from central casting. While she manages to keep herself in the limelight, as she should, she surrounds herself with willing (and sometimes unwilling) cohorts in her attempts to review restaurants through her many disguises and personalities. Her usually understanding husband, Michael, her precocious son Nicky, her friend and sometimes mentor Carol, and her close buddy Claudia all add to her support as the author becomes Miriam, Chloe, Brenda, Betty and Emily. A male critic could never have gotten away with what Ruth pulls off! It is a surprise to both the author and the reader that her dinner guests often become angry with her because she plays the roles of her assumed identities with such panache that they almost beg her to return to her own self.In one of the most alluring chapters, Ruth relates how she meets a total stranger, Dan Green, who ends up dining with her at Lespinasse. Keeping her secret, she spends an evening with him wondering what he will think of the review when he reads it. In another hilarious chapter she endures an evening with the "food warrior" at Windows of the World. Who wouldn't have wanted to be at the next table for that encounter?Through it all, Ruth Reichl keeps an eye on herself. She is her own best and worst critic, often worrying about thelegitimacy of her characters. In the end she simply reverts back to Ruth. As the book nears its close, Ruth speaks of her friend Carol's final illness and her own (ultimate) decision to leave the Times, a poignant reflection by the author. At this moment, knowing the book is about to be finished, I am reminded of that other moment when you've just finished an extraordinary meal and reluctantly acknowledge it's time to go. I highly recommend "Garlic and Sapphires".

Mark Kurlansky has a knack for writing about meaningful food histories ("Cod" and "Salt" precede his new book, "The Big Oyster") and much of his new work is as fun as the others. Kurlansky offers a somewhat zig-zagging tale of the forward march of the oyster, most of it revolving around the history of New York.Who would have thought that a writer could fill 280 pages of prose related to this delectable bivalve? Well, the answer is that while the author does tell much about the oyster there are many oysterless pages in evidence, somewhat stretched out by accompanying recipes. "The Big Oyster" is a book that is often in search of itself. It occasionally gets sidetracked in telling about the growth of New York, resulting in the unfortunate oyster sometimes getting pushed off to the side. However, Kurlansky is at his best when he gives reference to Oyster houses, floating wharves and markets and how the oyster became such a staple of both rich and poor. The demise of the New York City oyster beds (the last one closed in 1927) may be a depressing thought for most readers but Kurlansky heartens us by his providing readers with evidence that the waters around New York are cleaner now and that the oyster may one day return.Kurlansky is terrific at explaining the anatomy of an oyster and how it lives. I didn't know that the oyster is the only mollusk that doesn't move around.... once it attaches itself to an object it remains there for the rest of its life. He's also very good at tidbits of trivia. I hadn't realized that for most of the nineteenth century the Hudson River was know as the "North River". These small "eye-openers" give the book lots of color."The Big Oyster", as well as its predecessors, are enjoyable books about subjects one might otherwise not think about reading. Had the author not jumped around so much and kept the focus on his bivalve, he would have had a more streamlined book. Still, "The Big Oyster" is worth the read. I wonder if Kurlansky is already dreaming up a book on the history of caviar....

The first half of "Disturbia" is rather bland....Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is placed under house arrest for popping his teacher and he begins a three-month "incarceration" by watching videos and looking pretty bored. But after he picks up his binoculars and begins scouting the neighbors, things accelerate. Loosely based on Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window", "Disturbia" is an update with gizmos. One cannot imagine this film working on any level unless everyone had a cellphone. "Disturbia" is aimed at a younger crowd but an appealing performance by LaBeouf helps it to a satisfying conclusion.

Franois Truffaut is one of those enigmatic directors who is not easily definable, but his works are among the best the film industry has ever offered. Along that line, "The 400 Blows" stands up there as one of his best. The woeful tale of Antoine, cast off by his parents and scorned by his teachers, is a remarkable one and the then-young Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud gives a powerful performance as the teenage Parisian caught up in a world not to his liking."The 400 Blows" was the first in a series that Truffaut made with L&eacute;aud and I look forward to seeing the others. The eerie score is mesmerizing and the scenes shot from curious angles give the film a surreal look, albeit a terrific cinematographical one. I highly recommend "The 400 Blows"...Truffaut has made a masterpiece.

I received this as a Christmas present and for almost four months I've treated myself to a slow and deliberate read through this remarkable book. It's been said that the New Yorker is "possibly the best magazine ever" and its success, in large part, is due to its weekly cartoons. This book delivers them all and what a collection it is!Setting it up in decade format with observations by noted humorists, it's quite easy to put this book down from time to time and I mean that in a most sincere way. The "chapter" divisions help to remind us of how humor has been perceived over the last eighty years. Although there are some cartoons I don't understand, largely due to the times, the ones that are funny are REALLY funny. Yet it's the variety of the cartoons that add so much luster to this offering and it is not surprising that so many themes (husband vs. wife, etc.) return over and over.I have not yet looked at the CD (which I understand has some viewing difficulties) and I had wished that this book had been printed in two volumes because of its heft. Having said that, nothing can make up for the sheer inventiveness of the men and women who present their comic genius. To be gifted in this field of life certainly must give as much pleasure to the cartoonist as it does to the reader. Buy this book, find a sturdy table for it and read it with the knowledge that the hundreds of pages that lie ahead will forever give you something about which to laugh.

It is something to be known as the "dean of the White House press corps" and Helen Thomas, more than anyone else, has been there and seen it all over a career that has lasted for decades. Now it is her turn to tell it all, and she does with dead-on accuracy. She's earned it.Covering every president since JFK, Helen describes each one and the press secretaries with whom she has had to deal. Mincing no words, she reserves some of her harshest judgment for those in the press who fell asleep at the wheel after 9/11. For those of us who wondered who was asking the tough questions, Helen Thomas answers it....they weren't. While we know where the author stands with regard to the current administration she fleshes out her feelings about why this Washington crowd is the worst in years.She spends some time toward the end of the book reflecting on journalists she admires and I was glad to see her include an acquaintance of mine, Pauline Frederick, whose job covering the United Nations was exemplary. Helen had other favorites, too.....Mary McGrory, Scotty Reston and Walter Cronkite, to name just a few others.What is so good about "Watchdogs of Democracy?" is that is not just a collection of remembrances. Helen Thomas also paints a bleak future for "serious" journalism as we now have FOX News passing off as the real thing and a decline in the amount of time news organizations devote to non-entertainment news.Helen Thomas has had a remarkable career and "Watchdogs of Democracy?" is a terrific journalistic addition for those of us who remember the days of the men and women she covered and wonder about the direction of journalism in the twenty-first century. I highly recommend her book for its wisdom and insight.

With a healthy anticipation of seeing the New York theatre production of "The Light in the Piazza" I decided to orient myself with Elizabeth Spencer's story of the same name. After finishing this tale, I went on to read the others."The Light in the Piazza" is perhaps the most defined of the collection and one gets an instant taste of Ms. Spencer's writing and the kinds of characters she prefers. Women are central in all of them, no less Margaret Johnson in "Light". The author's women command attention as they maneuver the action around them. Manipulation is an even better word. All of these collected stories begin somewhere in mid-sentence and finish not much farther along. Enigmatic, troubled, wistful and "vagabondish", Ms. Spencer's men and women prefer the waft of an Italian breeze to any set action or direction. The vignettes are more or less satisfying, if only for the time that one spends with them. "Knights and Dragons", the longest of the stories, is an aimless sojourn but the final one, "the Cousins", is second only as a success to the title tale.Elizabeth Spencer has put together a nice group of stories. Even though her writing is mostly even and descriptive, some of her offerings end up being less so, though her depictions of Italy are true to form. Still, the bookend chapters are worth the read.

"The Birth of a Nation", D.W. Griffith's epic film of 1915, is an amazing look at early cinematography with a topic that is still discussed almost one hundred years after its premiere. The good news is that this film, even by modern standards, could not and would not be made today for obvious reasons, but as representative "history" it stands out.Divided into two equal parts, the film opens with two prominent families during the Civil War. The battle scenes are heroically portrayed and the long scene of Lincoln's assassination is one of the best. The second part, dealing with Reconstruction, is troubling yet fascinating to watch as hate disguised as bravery becomes the theme. The Klan (literally the "white knights on horseback") rise to many occasions to save their beleaguered friends and neighbors. The portrayal of blacks in the film is the most unsettling of all.Besides enjoying the performance of a very young Lillian Gish, what I liked most about "The Birth of a Nation" was its historic feel rather than its accuracy. If cinematography had been around earlier in the nineteenth century, one might very well assume that the characters, the action, the sets and the props would be just as one saw them in motion.I can understand why watching "The Birth of a Nation" would be distressing for many people today, but it helps to remember how far we've come as a country since 1915. With that in mind, I recommend seeing this monumental film.

Tom Fenton, a fixture at CBS for more than thirty years, has written a hard-hitting book about the condition of news coverage today. The condition, as he has rendered, is critical. If I could paraphrase Mr. Fenton's view of the news it would be this....the public sees just the tip of the iceberg. What he gives us is in "Bad News" is what lies underneath.That the news is "bad" these days is shameful and the author pounces on everything from news executives who are more interested in profits to the Bush White House, where spin rules the day. While at the outset one might think that Mr. Fenton is part of the "left-wing media", let me re-assure you....he goes after the Clinton White House as well. The clincher is that Walter Cronkite doesn't watch the CBS evening news....now that tells us something.Mr. Fenton relates where the state of the reporting of news has gone and why it has gone there. He offers pratical solutions to repair what has become the "news as entertainment" dilemma that we face today. His most important contribution is to remind us that practical reporting from foreign correspondents, an area in which he suggests the United States has failed miserably, is a key to enlightenment, enrichment and the ultimate education of American (and world) viewers."Bad News" is a good book. For those of us who share Mr. Fenton's views of the current state of disrepair of news presentation, this is a must read.

The new book about Julia Child, "My Life in France", written by her in collaboration with her grandnephew Alex Prud'homme is a fresh and wonderfully pleasing account of Julia's life in France after the Second World War. Arriving in 1948 with her devoted husband, Paul, Julia relates that she spoke no French, had never been to Europe and knew next to nothing about cooking. When she left several years later, this remarkable woman had turned French cooking on its ears."My Life in France" is terrific from beginning to end. It is a far more satisfying book than Noel Riley Fitch's austere yet comprehensive 1999 biography of Julia. One hears in the current book much more of Julia's voice as she whisks her way from Paris to Marseilles (whisking all the while through various kitchens). While most of the story is told with regard to France, it also encompasses her time in Germany, Norway and the United States. What emerges is a self-portrait of a life run at sometimes breakneck speed as she learns the art of French cooking. Along the way the reader meets (or in my case, re-meets) the characters who make her story so wonderfully rich. There is her devoted "La soeur Francaise", Simca, who collaborates with her on their breakthrough book, "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" and with whom she later parted professional company. Her often strained relations with her father, mostly about politics, make heady appearances, but it is her husband Paul who clearly shines through. What a wonderful marriage they must have had!Julia Child's story is hardly a rags-to-riches one, but eschewing the comfortable southern California life for adventure (and eventually finding her passion in so doing), makes her one of the formidably likeable people of her time. One can just hear her enjoying a good French meal (and there are many of these descriptions) and the fun she had through trial and error making a name for herself in the kitchen."My Life in France" is as soothing as a French breeze and as scrumptious as the food about which she describes. It should be on everyone's reading list.

It's easy for us who don't live in the Bible belt to think that a majority of gays have become ensconced in San Francisco or New York and that for all Mississippi threw at the nation during the 1960s civil right's movement, the new generation of hatred is not blacks, but gays. This documentary showcases the continuing hatred toward gays while at the same time it reveals the warmth of the individuals who drive dozens of miles to be in a place of freedom...namely the few gay bars in Mississippi."Small Town Gay Bar" is a compilation of personal testaments. "It's hard", they say, "but we survive". Survival is the key word when you look at the injustices done to the brave men and women who have tried to make a go of it and stayed. Harrassment, arson, condemnation from those who ought to be condemned themselves.....if you want to see it all, it's here. It's Disneyland in reverse.This is an important film because it reminds us that today, and not just in Mississippi, intolerance is still the practice of so many. But Mississippi is a good place to start to correct things and maybe a follow-up documentary a few years down the road will show something in a different light. I highly recommend "Small Town Gay Bar" for its honesty and courage.

James Chace's new book, &quot;1912&quot; recounts one of the more curious elections in our nation's history...one that saw four men vie for the electorate's vote. Although not much new is offered it is a political trip down memory lane as Chace delves into the personalities and issues of the campaign.For those of us who have been students of presidential elections we often look at the election of 1912 as a race between three men, not four. As Eugene Victor Debs had a much lower popular vote total than the other three and won no electoral votes he is often relegated to the sidelines in this election. Chace is at his best not only by including Debs in the mix but by his descriptions of Debs and how the Socialist candidate managed to run a respectable campaign against a former president, a current president and a president to be.Unfortunately, the author's writing, though straightforward and historically accurate, is often wooden. The more exciting aspects of the year (notably the nominations) never really come to life. The book also suffers from over-hype... while it was a fascinating election year, to say that the outcome sent the Republicans into &quot;a conservative ascendancy that reached its fullness with Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush&quot; (from the back flap of the dust cover) is a bit of a stretch. 1912 was an important election year but not a turning point as seems to be suggested.Chace rightly focuses on the two main players, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and leaves William Howard Taft somewhere in the dust. (which is fairly close to how the electoral vote turned out, at least for Taft) &quot;1912&quot; is a solid book but one that could have been spiced up a little with better writing.

I must admit that several times during my reading of the first parts of "Crashing the Gate" I almost put it down. Not that I don't agree with almost all of the positions taken by authors Jerome Armstrong and Markos Moulitsas Zuniga.....I do....but I felt like I was reading a litany of the misguidedness of the Bush administration....something I already knew. Coupled with that were facts and figures that didn't particularly hold my attention. The writing was often devoid of "oomph". However, I'm glad I stayed with this book because it gets better and better with each continuing chapter.For those of us who are "older" Democrats, (ones who were weaned on Vietnam and Watergate) blogging is something still fairly new to us and while "grassroots" has been in my vocabulary for decades, "netroots" is a word I had never heard of before. These two guys begin to pick up the pace when they go after consultants (like their nemesis, Bob Shrum) and most of the current Democratic leadership, with the notable exception of Howard Dean. They make a convincing case about carrying out a fifty-state strategy to win elections, something that the Democratic party seems only recently to have "discovered". Their analyses of some recent Congressional races make for good reading, and even more, good reason."Crashing the Gate" is a book about process and not necessarily about ideology, as the authors point out toward the end of the book. Yet, ideology cannot be separated out and that enhances their case for a progressive resurgence in this country. Politics is cyclical and if there ever was a time that the cycle needs to be reversed it is now. Even if "Crashing the Gate" gets off to a slow and dry start, stick with it....you'll learn a few things.

Philip Roth's exciting new book, "The Plot Against America" takes the United States through the early years of World War Two with a gripping twist of what might have happened if Charles Lindbergh had been elected president. The aviatior hero-cum-isolationist activist would certainly have taken us down a different path had he been elected, and Roth presents us with an almost worst-case scenario, had that been the case. As he points out in his postscript, the "Lindbergh for President" movement was at least in existence prior to 1940, so the possibility exists that some of the book's presentation as a work of fiction eerily might have come true.The author delivers his work from an autographical point of view and what he does most convincingly is give the reader a sense of fright, especially from a boy's perspective. As the young protagonist, Philip sees fear at every turn, inventing sequences of events far more ghastly than they were....ghosts in the basement, dead parents, mobs in the streets and even pretzel-making! When a child's mind wanders it wanders far afield and Roth captures this beautifully.As "The Plot Against America" progresses the national scene gets wilder and wilder. What eventually happens to Lindbergh shall remain a mystery to others who read this review but I highly recommend Philip Roth's book. It is a work of fiction, but.....

Claire Tomalin's recent biography of Thomas Hardy prompted me to look into not only re-reading Hardy's best novels after many years but also seeing what was available on DVD. I was pleased to see a production of "Tess of the D'Urbevilles" as I always associate Hardy with this work more than any other.It's easy to see why "Tess" is so popular among Hardy fans. It's Victorian, autobiographical and just what one might expect of the author. This production (1998) is a good representation and with some wonderful cinematography proves itself. However, the role of Tess is curiously underplayed by actress Justine Waddell to the point of any lack of sympathy for her character. What saves the film is a terrific performance by her main love, Angel Clare, as portrayed by Oliver Milburn. He manages to convey every emotion in dealing with Tess and he succeeds brilliantly. The supporting cast is excellent.If you enjoy Hardy I would suggest a better DVD that has stood the test of time..."Jude the Obscure" from 1971. It's a couple of hours longer than "Tess" but far more emotionally charged.

If you haven't figured out where John Stossel's political leanings are after the first few chapters of "Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity", he tells you at the very end. Stossel is indeed a Libertarian and happy to be one. He puts to rest as ludicrous certain things we have long considered truths, commenting on how he feels about many of them along the way. You may agree or disagree with him, but one thing is clear...John Stossel is opinionated and that's a refreshing place to be when you're the one uncovering waste in government, education incompetence or experts who really aren't experts. There's also a great deal of fun to be had for the reader as Stossel gets out his trademark shovel to expose the bad guys.It would be unfortunate if those disagreeing with many of his findings simply put down "Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity" without finishing it. I found myself nodding my head in accord with him when he goes after politicians, for instance. Stossel reserves a special niche of absolute distrust for those elected to lead us. He's an equal opportunity knocker when it comes to Democrats and Republicans. I can't agree with him when he cozies up to oil and drug companies (there are a good deal of negative things not covered about those two areas in his book) and I do like my chiropractor for how he's been able to relieve my back pain, but that's really not the point. Stossel keeps you thinking and that's all for the good.As much as I've enjoyed John Stossel on 20/20 over the years, I've gotten to know him much better after finishing "Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity" and like him even more. We take for granted so many things that Stossel says we shouldn't, and to his credit I highly recommend this book. I hope a sequel is in the works.

Rajiv Chandrasekaran's excellent book, "Imperial Life in the Emerald City" is unusually different from the recent books published about what went wrong in Iraq. While others tell of Iraq from an outsider's point of view, Chandrasekaran gives us a look at Iraq from the inside...from the vantage point of the protected American enclave known as the "Green Zone"... and what a look it is!It has been common knowledge for a long time that the planning for the post-invasion period in Iraq was woefully ill-planned and the author makes it clear through detailed descriptions of how and why this happened. His focus is on Lewis Paul ("Jerry") Bremer III, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and successor to the ill-fated Jay Garner. Bremer, nicknamed "the viceroy", was a seasoned diplomat from a preppy background but had had a good deal of experience in the diplomatic world. The choice of him as director, however, was one of convenience after other larger luminaries were passed over for the job. Bremer's yearlong tenure in the Green Zone was marked by bad decisions by Bremer (de-Baathification being the worst) coupled with a personality that didn't exactly help to unite his underlings. Chandrasekaran exposes Bremer perfectly and it is easily the great central theme of the book.Along the way, the author richly contrasts life inside the Green Zone to the one outside. (The "Emerald City" was a perfect name for the Green Zone as it was an oasis in a deeply troubled country) Detail is never overlooked by Chandrasekaran... it's hard to imagine that Bremer actually wanted $9 million for a national Iraqi ZIP Code project, for instance! Added to all of this was the political infighting of Iraqi leaders, the inability of those in Washington to understand any of the mess they had created and the witness of a quick rise in sectarian fighting and the slow demise of a country the United States had committed itself to save and rebuild."Imperial Life in the Emerald City" is smoothly narrated and Rajiv Chandrasekaran deserves lots of praise for this unique contribution to our recent history in Iraq. I highly recommend it.

Tom Brokaw's new book, "Boom!" mentions "The Big Chill" and somehow I've missed seeing it over the years. I was pleasantly surprised to see then-young actors Tom Berenger, Kevin Kline, Glenn Close and William Hurt (among others) come together for a strong ensemble performance. These thirty-somethings gather over a weekend of a sad event and manage to explore their current and past lives in a way that seems surprisingly relevant. I wouldn't say "The Big Chill" is timeless but I could imagine a group of my own friends having some of the same conversations today.If there's not a whole lot of "action" in "The Big Chill" it makes up for it in insight. The soundtrack is a great addition but it is really the fine acting that carries the film and it's great to see so many up and coming stars. "The Big Chill" is worth a look.

This bright and colorful book is a great, easy read and guaranteed to make the reader smile. (or your money back?) It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is....a look at the enormous success of the Popeil family over many decades and the dozens of products associated with them. The star, of course, is Ron Popeil and when I see him on a TV infomercial hawking the Showtime Rotisserie he ALMOST makes be believe I should buy one.The author, Timothy Samuelson, introduces the Popeil family and neither minces words about the inter-family problems nor the bankruptcy Ronco was forced into in 1984. Yet, this book is really a walk down memory lane for those of us old enough to remember the chop-o-matic and the veg-o-matic. The book's illustrations (mostly photos and drawings of past products) are terrific and my only real criticism is the use of annoyingly small narrative print.Lastly, "But, Wait! There's More!" is a testament to the staying power of Ron Popeil. An ingenious inventor, he has re-invented himself many times over....and he's still out there trying to convince us (...)

Ray Bradbury's "The Cat's Pajamas" is a delightful compilation of his collected stories of more than a half century. With a breadth of story-telling ability the author delves into everything from ghosts and aliens to human prejudice and, in the end, poetry. There's something here for everyone.To say that Bradbury's stories are short is not to underestimate their effectiveness. In "Hail to the Chief", a group of drunken senators gamble away the United States to an Indian tribe, one state at a time. Human trust is put on the line in "A Careful Man Dies", his longest offering. The title story, "The Cat's Pajamas", is one of his warmest and funniest. I think, however, Bradbury saves his best for last. "The Completist" has the reader wondering where things are going before a surprise ending is supplied. His final story, "Epilogue", is wonderfully written as a poetic tribute to those erstwhile writers he holds in high regard."The Cat's Pajamas" is an easy and breezy read from an author who has been writing for decades. I recommend it highly.

Christopher Lawford has written a soul-bearing autobiography that spells out his drug addiction, his recovery and his extended family's influence over the years. While it is nicely written and funny on one level, it is revealing on another one...and not on the fortunate side.Mr. Lawford has lived fifty years of an often confusing life. Born into the Kennedy family he has always seen himself as a "second string" Kennedy....one of those cousins who gets mixed up in the whole clan and lacks an identity. Partly because of this but also owing to his genetic makeup, he turned to drugs at an early age and treaded water for about twenty years before taking the courageous step to take charge of his life. To that end, I give him enormous credit.There are many problems, however, with this book. It needs serious editing, for instance. Drugs and womanizing are the center of his life, but three hundred pages of this is enough to swamp a manatee. Unhappily for the reader, the final pages are not much more satisfying. Lawford becomes overly preachy about his recovery and then proceeds to recount the dissolution of his marriage. If Christopher Lawford has grown, I don't see much evidence of it. As proud as he is to trumpet to others that he is a Kennedy, it seems he always turns to them at every corner for his needs. They are his enablers and I don't get a picture that this will stop anytime soon, regardless of the author's protestations of becoming an individual apart from his family.As he often mentions in "Symptoms of Withdrawal", Christopher Lawford has had every advantage in life without much forward success. I wish him well in his continued recovery but also had hoped that this book had been written in a better way.

Finally, the adults are talking in Washington...at least ten of them. The Iraq Study Group Report is substantive and offers creative solutions to the one-dimensional Bush approach to Iraq...an approach that put the United States in serious jeopardy and one that threatens to unleash a powder keg all over the Middle East.The report begins with an educational assessment before it delves into recommendations. It takes into account not only the Shia, Sunni and Kurdish regions of Iraq but the countries that border Iraq as well. One wonders where this group was when the planning for the war was being formed. It certainly didn't occur to the Bush administration that any overview was necessary...hence the current mess we're in now.While Baker and company remind us that by no means are these recommendations foolproof, they are at least a start to know where, when and how to unravel from Iraq. The recommendation with the most impact, however, is one that Bush may likely ignore...and to our country's peril...talking to Iraq's neighbors, especially Iran and Syria. Engaging them without precondition is a must and failure to do so will continue to lead us down the path of more foreign policy fiascoes.The Iraq Study Group Report reminds us that "violence cannot end unless dialogue begins..." It's a sobering statement in a timely report. They have done their homework in areas that the present White House leadership has not and also have offered proposals that go deeper and carry more weight than a "stay the course" approach ever could.

Given all that is happening with late night comedy these days, "The Late Shift", a review of the first rivalry flare-up between Letterman and Leno, (and NBC and CBS) is worth a second look... or a first look if you haven't seen it before. One wonders how many of the same behind-the-scenes activities are going on at present, as was offered in this film.There are many fine performances in "The Late Shift", but Kathy Bates really shines here. Her role as Helen Kushner, the hard-driving agent behind Jay Leno, is forceful and convincing. This film really reminds viewers that what one sees onstage at 11:30 each night is the outcome of often intense discussion, negotiation and infighting backstage. "The Late Shift" captures this in a big way and I recommend viewing it, especially in today's light.

Laura Hillenbrand's book &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a winner. She has told a story of triumph so richly and so deftly that when I finished the last page I closed the book very slowly, deeply moved by what I had read. Her penchant for drama coupled with her wonderful insights into horse and human alike make this a book for the ages.The story of Seabiscuit is one of the great sports stories of the twentieth century. Like the &quot;little engine that could&quot;, Seabiscuit overcame overwhelming odds to become a true champion. And Ms. Hillenbrand captures it all.From the most basic point of view the author puts you in each horse race. Instead of watching from the sidelines, which is the only way most people ever see this kind of competition, the author puts you ON TOP of Seabiscuit. You feel you're racing along with him at breakneck speed, co-habiting the bodies of Red Pollard and George Woolf. It's an amazing piece of writing.Of course, this is about so much more than a horse race. Pollard, Tom Smith and Charles Howard share the spotlight with their famous equine and theirs is really a collective story in a sense....how these three with their enormously different backgrounds could come together and work so well as a team year after year is credit to each of them...and their horse. Smith, to me, is the most intriguing of the three. He seems to share the same sixth sense about horses as Seabiscuit does about people.The dramatic content of the book, however, is what drives it. Hillenbrand is a wonderful storyteller and her research is terrific. The dozens of moves around the country, the constant scratches due to weather, the teamwork....and especially Seabiscuit's losses....all add up to make his victories that much sweeter. And you can hear the current cheering from the thousands of people who &quot;watch&quot; Seabiscuit's races in the pages of this book.....most of us who may have known this wonderful horse by name only.You don't have to be a fan of horse racing to enjoy this book. But in the end, you will have much more of an appreciation for it and a love of a book well written.

Having first heard of "Marjoe" in "God is not Great", the new Christopher Hitchens book, I was compelled to have a look. "Marjoe" is as deserving of the Oscar it received as any documentary I've ever seen. Marjoe, the boy, was raised to deliver and deliver he did. The early movies of his sermonizing are terrific and shocking. That he could actually perform weddings (also shown) is amazing.To Marjoe's credit, he allowed us a peek behind the wizard's curtain while in his late twenties. Having had a second awakening of sorts as to the fraud he was perpetrating, he shared it with a film crew in behind-the-scenes admissions. No sooner does the viewer learn the tricks of the trade then we see Marjoe out performing his shtick. The faux southern accent and perfect timing work like a charm as he seduces his audience minute by minute. Of course, there's always the appeal for money, which Marjoe gleefully counts out later, once with a colleague and once in his motel room. One of the best scenes is captured as he has dinner with a Texas family who supports him. He mentions other "phony" ministers and the adoring family concurs. All the while, Marjoe lets on not a peep about himself.This film draws on so many emotions it's hard to know where to draw the line. Toward the end of the film, Marjoe, himself, weighs in on his own morality. Is he bad or evil? In the end he declares himself to be simply "bad", thus delivering himself from any harsher judgment. "Marjoe", the film, is particularly timely today. Ever wonder if Pat Robertson is missing something?

To see how far we've come in the world of science and its important link to criminology, one only needs to read "Bloodsworth", a stunning book about one man's being pulled back from the brink. Handed the death penalty after a first murder conviction and then two consecutive life sentences after a second trial, Kirk Bloodsworth worked tirelessly to clear his name. Coupled with that hard work and with the help of his attorney Bob Morin, who refused to give up on Kirk, this is a story of almost unfathomable proportion.With a rat-a-tat delivery reminiscent of Dragnet's Joe Friday, author Tim Junkin not only tells the story of the 1984 murder of Dawn Hamilton but he paints a sympathetic portrait of Kirk Bloodsworth.... a man whose hard luck life would make it easier (or so it seemed) to convict him. Junkin does well in allowing us to get inside Kirk's head, and from that vantage point the story unfolds with layers of intrigue. Junkin's narrative style makes it hard to put down the book."Bloodsworth" is the best case I've seen to date regarding the inequality and unfairness in the application of the death penalty. While Junkin doesn't go overboard to present that side of the case he duly notes that "the United States is one of only a handful of industrialized countries that continues to execute its prisoners." That's a sobering statement and Tim Junkin, through the case of Kirk Bloodsworth, has offered an electrifying glimpse at what can happen to an innocent man. How many more Kirk Bloodsworths are out there, one can only imagine. This book is a powerful read and I highly recommend it.

I don't usually review DVDs and CDs but after reading Claire Tomalin's excellent new biography of Thomas Hardy I decided to rent a couple of films based on his novels. "Jude the Obscure", a mini-series delivered in 1971, was my first choice and what a choice it was! Set on two DVDs (six episodes of forty-five minutes each) I came away dazzled not only with a greater appreciation of Hardy but of this particular group of actors.Jude is a character of great sympathy who is in constant conflict between his marriage to one woman and his passions for another. Leading this strong group is Robert Powell (the entire cast is British, of course) and he delivers a tour de force in the title role of Jude. The supporting women, (Fiona Walker as Jude's cousin and real love and Alex Marshall as his wife) express a range of emotions that plays true to Hardy's work. This mini-series became so engrossing as I got into it that I watched the entire series in one sitting. It's a drama-packed production, wonderfully directed and photographed and not for one minute seeming to be outdated. I highly recommend it.

"Good Bye, Lenin!", a German film from 2003, is marvelously creative and lots of fun. The premise itself makes the film so intriguing...a woman long committed to the Socialist state of East Germany, falls into a coma just before the Berlin Wall comes down and upon regaining consciousness eight months later is protected by her family (largely her son) with regard to the changes that have occurred. The high jinks that surround her re-emergence are worth every minute of the movie.Daniel Bruhl, who plays Alex, the son, is the chief "overseer" of his mother, played by Katrin Sass. Bruhl steals just about every scene in the film as he remains on edge should Mutter discover that democracy has come to Berlin. Slowly she begins to question the changes and in one scene, Mutter wanders outside of her apartment, undetected by Alex, to see for herself those unbelievable capitalist changes that have occurred. Recaptured by Alex and his sister, Alex then plots, with the help of his video-making friend, to revamp the story to one that the East German government has let in thousands of West Germans who want to be rid of western goods and ideas. If there were ever shades of the 1960's TV series, "Mission: Impossible", this film has them."Good Bye, Lenin!" is a brilliant piece of work...one that is amusing as much as it is implausible. I highly recommend it for its story line and an endearing performance delivered by young Daniel Bruhl.

Jimmy Carter has held a unique position over the last thirty years of being a participant and a witness to the changes in America. Never did I realize what a powerful writer he was until I read his new book, "Our Endangered Values". Fasten your seat belts....the former president is on a roll and has written the best book of the year.Mr. Carter's book is like experiencing a one hundred yard dash.....there's no time for pause and he covers everything in sight. Mincing no words, he hits hard...at the current administration in particular, but his crosshairs are aimed at others, as well. President Carter's serious approach discusses the fundamendalist religious right, the gap between rich and poor, the "war of choice" in Iraq, abortion, gays, arms control and much more. Exhausting? Not at all. While he criticizes he also offers better ways at solving our country's problems. This is a hard book to put down for even a minute.Redirecting America's focus is the best part of "Our Endangered Values". I can't imagine the current occupant of the White House even writing the preface to this book. The timeliness of Mr. Carter's book and the failures of the Bush White House make his offering all the more important. Jimmy Carter continues to be a leader of utmost character and strength. I highly recommend "Our Endangered Values" for the sobering look at America today.

It's hard to imagine two months after the collapse of the twin towers (and the nostalgia they have since brought) that this entire complex, though having gained public approval over the years, was not always applauded during its short life span.Angus Gillespie does a good job at recounting the history of the towers from well before their inception and he manages to do much of this through the eyes of the Port Authority, the World Trade Center's overseer. Indeed, that so much of the book is ABOUT the Port Authority I wondered how long it would take to actually know what went on in the World Trade Center of only a few months ago.Still, Mr. Gillespie presents a fascinating background as he includes political, historical and economical reasons for the building of the twin towers. And he introduces a cast of colorful characters who often feud with state politicians and, of course, amongst themselves. He takes the reader through many years of planning and strategizing and gives one a bird's-eye view of the vast conglomeration of people, businesses and egos that drove the project. Mr. Gillespie serves as a cheeleader for these towers, most notably standing up to a host of architects who simply disdained them. He relates delays in construction and why they happened, the unique relationship between New York and New Jersey and loads of other facets of life as the towers were slowly erected.There are a few downsides. No photos and few drawings exist. Facts are often repeated. (In the first 25 pages the author tells us no less than five times when the Port Authority was established) And there is not nearly enough information about the daily workings of the Trade Center. It is only in the very last chapter that Mr. Gillespie gets down to the brass tacks of telling us the ins and outs of running such a large complex. It is only then that color begins to seep into this book. I realize that this book was written two years ago, but except for the Austin Tobins, the Guy Tozzolis and a few other principals, the book is informative but dry.Still, I would recommend it. Having read John Tauranac's much better book about the construction of the Empire State Building, I came away with a far better understanding in both books about what goes into building a skyscraper. The answer is plenty.

"Too Big to Fail" reminds us that nothing is too big too fail, especially in the world of high finance and risk taking. Revisiting the Wall St. bailout, the film gives us a wide range of wonderful actors in a variety of dramatic roles, none the more outstanding than William Hurt, who plays Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Paulson's job is "simple"...to keep the American economy from going into free fall and Hurt is terrific in the role. But I found the dialogue stilted and unimaginative. No one except Paulson ever has a good word, it seems, or a noble thought throughout much of the film. While this helps to create some tension and give Hurt's character credence, it lacks spontaneity. "Too Big To Fail" succeeds, but it could have been an even better film.

The film that launched Billy Bob Thornton's career, "Sling Blade", is one of the most stirring films released over the past dozen years. The character portrayed by Thornton, Karl Childers, a mentally deficient individual released from a state hospital years after killing two people, is understated and powerful. Reading Thornton's face is to read his mind and the entire film is brilliantly paced. The supporting cast, led by a young Lucas Black, is terrific. "Sling Blade" is worth viewing more than once for its nuanced dialogue and heart-wrenching performances.

It's hard to reconcile the Lyndon B. Johnson as president that I watched when I was growing up during Vietnam and the Lyndon Johnson as Senate leader in Robert Caro's definitive and comprehensive book, &quot;Master of the Senate&quot;. President Johnson always looked tired and sad. Caro's Johnson is full of the vitality and energy that I had missed ten years earlier.Slowly and deliberately, Caro sets out on a path to show the reader that LBJ was a man of tremendous complexity, imbued with an enormous drive and talent. Senator Johnson certainly attained, as majority leader, the peak job of his career in a sense and I'm sure a job that was his most satisfying, his mixed reviews as president, notwithstanding. That such a massive literary effort could be achieved showing just twelve years of Johnson's life is a tribute to both author and subject.Caro knows how to build and tell a story better than anyone. Setting the opening chapters as the prelude he gradually constructs an account of the mushrooming career of a man who could be charming and vulgar, obliging and vicious, honorable and ignominious, noble and petty. That Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon served together in the Senate and were back-to-back presidents is one of the great side stories in American politics. The characters in &quot;Master of the Senate&quot; are handled deftly by Caro, who always puts Lyndon Johnson right at center stage. There are men of great stature surrounding Johnson like Senator Richard Russell and Speaker Sam Rayburn, who more often than not and more often than others steered LBJ's career. There are some losers, too.....principled Senator Paul Douglas, who never seemed to get the hang of Senate politics, Senator William Knowland, who never learned how to count votes and President Eisenhower who comes off looking like an informed George W. Bush. But Caro saves his best episodes for the crescendos of the later acts, especially the Civil Rights fight of 1957. Through the middle of every storm there is Lyndon Johnson, HAVING to win every contest.I was particularly roused by one comment Johnson made to Katherine Graham, wife of (and later publisher herself) Phil Graham of the Washington POST. He told Mrs. Graham that &quot;civil rights could be accomplished, not by idealism but by rough stuff.&quot; And since Johnson played rough (and knew how to count) he was always besting Senators Douglas, Humphrey and their fellow liberals who preached the idea but didn't have Johnson's ability to cajole, buttonhole, dealmake and even compromise when necessary.Although both admired and detested as a Senate leader, Lyndon Johnson was ultimately a man of astounding achievement. It is ironic that though LBJ sought the presidency so vigorously, he attained it accidentally. However, his home was the Senate and in that body he was an unqualified success. Robert Caro has captured the essence of Lyndon Baines Johnson and diffused it remarkably through the 1,040 pages of this masterpiece.

"Plan 9 from Outer Space", often referred to as "the worst movie ever made", delivers on many levels. Good, bad, you name it.....it is a sensationally awful film that is enjoyable from bad acting to everything else. Knowing that it is such a dud makes the viewer look for each nuance of amateurishness. Its kitsch is its treasure.Yes, you can indeed detect the strings on the "flying saucers". These metal frisbees are the first hint of what lies ahead. People who have seen "Plan 9" come away from it with different favorite moments. Mine is a continuing one.....police cars whizz along to the cemetery in broad daylight arriving a few minutes later in darkness and fog. One would think the graveyard was in a different time zone. By the way, there seems to be only one camera angle for the police car romp...as if the cameraman staked out his position knowing there would be multiple runs. The zombie characters played by actors Tor Johnson and Vampira are over the top in melodrama. It's a wonder that their intended "prey" can't outrun these slow-moving creatures. ("The Munsters" pale by comparison) The two men on the spaceship also "shine". The ruler, played by John Breckinridge, adopts a faux-English accent and seems bored with the whole adventure, leaving his underling, Eros, to carry out the tasks of his people. Dudley Manlove (now THERE'S a great name for you!) plays Eros and has the most silver-throated voice I've heard in films. I found out later that he did a lot of radio work and was the voice of LUX soap.Surprisingly, one thing that works very well is the sound track. Had it been connected with a film that actually was good, it would have captured more attention and perhaps an award nomination. But, being the film that "Plan 9" is, it probably has gotten more play than it ever could have."Plan 9 from Outer Space" is something that the whole family can watch and laugh about...even after multiple viewings. Just mind the popcorn...it's so unintentionally funny SO often that you might want to be careful not to spit out any kernels during guffaws.

"Strangers on a Train" is a well-appreciated but lesser known film than some of Alfred Hitchcock's later works, but it nonetheless remains a remarkable story with an excellent cast. The tale of two men "exchanging" murders is a brilliant one and it is played out here with full suspense. The real tragedy of the film, however, was the sudden death of one of its two co-stars, Robert Walker, the same year it was released. Walker, who had suffered from personal problems of his own, gives a riveting performance as Bruno Anthony, a psychotic killer who enlists the aid of a naive tennis star, Guy Haines, played by Farley Granger.Hitchcock's use of light is as wonderful as ever and the climax on an amusement park carousel, is one of his best. Terror is everywhere during the last few minutes of the film. I highly recommend "Strangers on a Train"....it's one of Hitchcock's finest.

James M. McPherson, who wrote the authoritative "Battle Cry of Freedom", has put together a rather short but masterful book concerning the battle of Antietam, the battle that changed the course of the Civil War. What McPherson does so well is his laying of the groundwork for the events that led up to this bloody exchange with a narrative that glides along easily. Not only are we reminded of the swings in battle outcomes but McPherson spends a good amount of time on the psyches of both the north and the south as victories turned into defeats and losses became triumphs.The author personalizes much of the book so we get to know what the commanding generals were probably thinking as well as the foot soldiers and citizens. He also includes headlines and snippets from the leading papers which I found helped to give meaning to the moods of the two sides.McPherson saves his harshest criticism for Union general George B. McClellan, whose infinite indecision cost the Union many chances for advancement. He reinforces the conclusion that McClellan, though popular with his soldiers, was not the right man at the right time. McClellan's dealings with President Lincoln are particularly revealing."Antietam: Crossroads of Freedom" might simply have been titled "1862". It was a fascinating year during the Civil War and McPherson deserves credit for this chronicle.

Nothing came closer to representing elegance on film in the 1960s than Audrey Hepburn and she is wonderful in this classic film, "Breakfast at Tiffany's". Nicely paired with a debonair George Peppard, (as Paul Varjak) Hepburn stylishly breezes her way through life as Holly Golightly, a bon vivant yet insecure goldigger. Hepburn owns this film, as well she should.For those of us who grew up with fond memories of Manhattan in the early sixties, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is a walk down memory lane. What struck me most was the overall vibrant colors of the film...from Hepburn's wardrobe right down to the taxi hues. It's fun to see men dress up for parties in jackets and skinny ties with the ever-present cigarette in hand (not to mention Hepburn's king-size cigarette holder!) but to remember the small things such as typewriters, home milk delivery and men wearing hats on the street. The scenes in the New York Public Library with its rows of index cards and other scenes with rotary phones evoke an era not long forgotten. The funniest few moments of the film include Holly's and Paul's visit to Tiffany's, itself, with the irresistible John McGiver as a sales clerk."Moon River", the signature song of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", tells us about "two drifters, off to see the world", and that is exactly who Holly and Paul are. Yet at long last, they might.....might....just be ready to settle down with each other. "Breakfast at Tiffany's" is a total enjoyment from beginning to end.

Don and Petie Kladstrup's new book, "Champagne", is a serious but lively romp through the history of champagne...champagne, the drink and Champagne, the region. It is also a revealing look at the French and how they defended what became their national symbol through war and (literally) pestilence. Defend it they did, to their credit and our good fortune.Written as a timeline, "Champagne" begins in the Middle Ages with an almost startling revelation....the bubbles in the wine, so essential to its success and taste in later years, were considered to be a flaw. The drink as we know it today must have borne little or no resemblance to what was consumed hundreds of years ago. The Kladstrups delve into many other aspects of the making and the keeping of champagne which are as engrossing as their narrative....how sediment was handled, the trials and errors of storing champagne so the bottles would not explode, the care of the vineyards, and so on. I was surprised to hear that dry champagne was a rather late development and that its initial offerings were met with resistance as most people preferred their champagne to be sweet. The transportation of champagne is one of the more humorous parts of this offering.As much as this book concerns itself with the product, it is even more a story of people and politics. The effects that wars had on the region of Champagne (and no one really knows where those boundaries begin and end) make it all the more surprising that champagne could ever have survived the onlsaught of armies inflicting a tremendous toll, most notably during World War I, on the vineyards and the people who owned and operated them. The tragedy of the levelling of the city of Reims during the war can be coupled with the infestation of the deadly phylloxera, which ruined crops for years.The recurring theme in "Champagne", however, is the heart of the French people, who have overcome all of these assaults to secure their national pride through champagne. According to the commander of French forces in Reims, "as long as there is champagne here, we will defend it". That quote sums it up in the best possible way."Champagne" is as delightful a book as the drink itself. In fact, I'd suggest the reader pour a glass or two while reading it. Thank you, Don and Petie Kladstrup for giving us this wonderful history of champagne.

After reading a glowing review of this book in the New York Times's Book Review section I had high hopes for "The Stories of English" by David Crystal. However, by about page twenty I knew I was in trouble. While the author makes some terrific points about the evolution of English, dialect changes and linguistic notations, this book just isn't an easy or pleasurable read. Since the bulk of the book mainly focuses on British English, as an American reader it didn't really pick up for me until toward the end when Crystal writes a chapter entitled "New Horizons".I can't easily recommend this book but I'm sure there are those who would find it to their liking. Two much more fascinating books about our language are Robert MacNeil's "The Story of English" and Simon Winchester's "The Meaning of Everything".

I was inspired to watch this documentary after reading Simon Garfield's terrific new book, "Just My Type", in which he relates the universal success and appeal of the font, "Helvetica". The film adds color to the book, especially with the interviews to which the viewer is treated.Helvetica has been around since the late fifties and can be seen everywhere. It's amazing to me that one font can take hold and spread like a wildfire, consuming other fonts in its way. As the film indicates, however, Helvetica isn't the font for every place or occasion...but it certainly has become the standard that we recognize.It would be good (though not particularly necessary) for the viewer of this film to first read Garfield's book. But either way, this is a fascinating look at an art form which has become more popular since the advent of the computer, and I highly recommend "Helvetica".

Ferzan Ozpetek has delivered a wonderful film of love and curiosity regarding one woman's sudden loss and discovery of a life in which her late husband took part. Led by Margherita Buy and her co-star, Stefano Accorsi, Ozpetek has assembled a cast of gay and transsexual characters that are as funny and warm as the Italian day is long. This is Armistead Maupin's "Tales of the City" transported a continent away.As Antonia (Buy) and Michele (Accorsi) meet there is understandable tension. Massimo, Antonia's late husband, had a secret seven-year affair with Michele and the two survivors seem headed toward protecting their own turf. Yet, as the film continues, they are drawn to each other with the need to fill in the holes in each of their lives. Ozpetek does a wonderful job at bringing the film to a poignant close."His Secret Life" is full of outward emotion but the tenderness achieved strikes a nice balance. I highly recommend it.

"The Science of Sleep" is like no other film I've seen. Blending reality and fantasy into a seamless thread, director Michel Gondry has produced a gem. The cast is uniformly good and is headed by the appealing Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal, in a role as St&eacute;phane, for which he seems destined. He makes the film what it is with an abundance of humor and pathos.The visual effects are among the best the industry has to offer and the childlike "Alice in Wonderland" quality of the film is superb. It is well-paced and engrossing at every turn. I highly recommend "The Science of Sleep" for its creativity and charm.

Doug Wead's new book "All the Presidents' Children" offers good insights into the lives of presidential offspring. While he takes more time with some short biographies than others, he includes a final individual summary of all of the children near the end of the book. This was an undertaking well worth the time.The problem with "All the Presidents' Children" largely has to do with the unnerving number of inaccuracies. For instance, Millard Fillmore was never "elected" thirteenth president. And Martha Johnson could never have lived to see Teddy Roosevelt sworn in as president....she had died two months earlier. Sometimes Wead's conclusions are downright silly. He claims that Richard Taylor somehow had been able to forecast that the South would lose the Civil War even as the war began. That's some prescience!Wead's writing style is not very gripping, either, although the entries on Alice Roosevelt, Charlie Taft and Michael Reagan are done well. At the conclusion of the book the author admits to having had difficulty sorting out all the details. The question then is why was this book rushed to print? Some more careful research could have helped.The lives of the children of our presidents range from A to Z. If for this reason alone, "All the Presidents' Men" is a worthwhile effort. It's just too bad much of it gets lost in the details.

From the opening credits, "Music and Lyrics" bounces along and for ninety minutes draws you in to what has to be one of the most charmingly appealing films of the last few years. Everything seems to work here beginning with the simple premise that a has-been songwriter is given a deadline of two days to write a new song for an up-and-coming pop queen...only to discover that he needs a lyricist. And boy, does he find one!Hugh Grant plays Alex Fletcher, the aging star of the musical group "Pop". With that song deadline looming and down-and-out about his success in completing it on time, in walks Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) to water his plants. What happens from here on out is pure magic as Alex discovers Sophie's natural talent with lyrics. The film sails along, never letting down, as they work together and discover each other.I've seen "Music and Lyrics" twice and liked it even better the second time. The supporting cast with Brad Garrett as Alex's tortured manager, Kristen Johnston, as Sophie's neurotic-driven older sister and Haley Bennett as Cora Corman, the new pop sensation, are all terrific. The songs are evocative of another age and work well in support of the film. But it is really the chemistry between Grant and Barrymore that wins the viewer over. Perfectly cast, she plays foil to his gentle, persuasive humor and the end result is sheer joy. I highly recommend "Music and Lyrics". It's a refreshingly funny, witty and wonderful film.

Phil Scott's book, "Hemingway's Hurricane" is a quick and good read about the century's most powerful hurricane....the category 5 storm that smashed into the Florida Keys over Labor Day weekend in 1935. Finished before Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, Scott's book takes on a narrative with some unintended consequences and supreme ironies.Set as a timeline, the author briefs the reader well with his background of the Bonus Army of World War I veterans, their 1932 march on Washington D.C. and the veterans' subsequent detour to the Florida Keys, courtesy of Franklin D. Roosevelt, to give them low-paying jobs. "Hemingway's Hurricane" centers around these hundreds of veterans, their work in the Keys (much of it building roads) and the misfortune they had at being directly in the path of the hurricane. Scott relates all of this in a nicely paced way. Yet two things stand out in his book....there's very little to do with Ernest Hemingway....he makes not much more than a minor appearance at the beginning and at the end, so the title of the book is confusing. The author also provides too many cameo appearances by others who were part of the storm and the recovery. Fewer characters with more time spent with them would have increased my enjoyment of Scott's work.Yet it is the comparison to Katrina, not mentioned in "Hemingway's Hurricane" that makes for the unintended attraction. The 1935 storm had its own version of FEMA (FERA) and a major player, Fred Ghent, the director of the veteran's camps, who was the Michael Brown of his day. His decision not to get a relief train down in time to evacuate the veterans was one of the worst miscalculations of the storm. It's almost as if we can hear FDR saying, "Ghentie, you're doin' a heckuva job!" Perhaps the oddest and saddest comparison is that Katrina, hitting Louisiana almost seventy years to the day after the Keys hurricane, underscores that government hasn't come all that far in preparedness, rescue and recovery."Hemingway's Hurricane" is a good book but not a great one. However, Scott's attention to detail make it worth the read and the story is one that has needed to be told.

"The Last Kiss", a remarkable movie from a few years back, tests anyone's patience as a group of young men and women struggle with the rituals of marriage, adulthood and love. Thoroughly Italian, it's amazing there are individuals standing at the end. But they do, and it is fun to watch. Led by a cast that includes the terrific actor Stefano Accorsi (his face is a map of Italy) and Stefania Sandrelli, who struggles through a mid-life crisis, the film produces a riotous wave of emotion. I highly recommend it.

Author Alex Kerr has written an expos&eacute; of &quot;monumental&quot; proportion with his book &quot;Dogs and Demons&quot;. It is well worth the read.This book could simply have been titled &quot;Bureaucracy and Concrete&quot;, for those are the words that come back to haunt this land and its ability to fly out of its own muck. A friend who has taught English to Japanese in northern Japan for years agreed with the condemnation about which Kerr writes....Japan has been its own worst enemy.Roads leading to nowhere, dams all over the place, desecration of the countryside, unneeded monuments galore, martial education....the list goes on. Kerr writes with a heavy hand but also a heavy heart. You can almost hear him say, &quot;it could be so much better&quot;. We, in the United States, live so much more productive and largely instructive lives that it is hard to imagine that one of the wealthiest nations on earth (on paper, at least) could have been so internally misguided. And the solutions appear to be out of reach of their own mindset.Kerr's writing style is often uneven and repetitive. But his message is resounding. Now, will anyone in a position of self-serving bureaucratic government in Japan get the picture? Kerr holds out little hope.

Malcolm Gladwell's book, "Blink" was offered up as a selection for a local reading group. Though initially less than fully interested I took the plunge and read it. I'm glad I did.Whether or not one concurs with the hypotheses and conclusions given by Mr. Gladwell, the fact that some of us are better than others in making correct decisions in a split second is a good place from which to start. He argues that, indeed, certain people have this natural (or often learned) ability to see immediately what others need to study. "Snap Decision" or "In An Instant" might have been good chapter titles for "Blink" but when the author discusses the downside of acting spontaneously (as in the Amadou Diallo case) "Rush to Judgment" would have been a more appropriate title.What gives this book appeal is Gladwell's narrative style. It's nicely paced, informative and often amusing. (see the section about Paul Ekman trying to explain how the muscles in the face work!) "Blink" has given me enough to savor so that I plan next to read the author's previous book, "The Tipping Point". "Blink" is a good read on an unusual subject and I recommend it.

Having slogged through the opening chapter of Joseph Ellis's fine book, &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;, I found myself a little hesitant about continuing. I'm very glad I did..... the author has done an excellent job. Ellis writes in a personal style that allows his readers to get behind the faade of these important men (and one woman!)as we gain access to their thoughts, feelings and interactions.While this book is not overly comprehensive, it does offer some terrific insights. I don't believe I've ever read such a dramatic account of the Aaron Burr-Alexander Hamilton duel and while we all know the outcome, Ellis richly details the events that led up to the face-off and delves into the personalities of both men. Burr is rather lost to the ages after that but Hamilton's reputation grows. I'm glad he included this chapter as Hamilton seemed to be among the least favorite of his fellow &quot;Founding Brothers&quot;.Benjamin Franklin is largely passed over in Ellis's book, but I'm happy to see that he devoted a chapter to the importance of George Washington's Farewell Address. If you've read the expansive David McCullough biography about John Adams, you can quickly get through Ellis's writings about Adams, his wife Abigail, and Adams's relationship and correspondence with Thomas Jefferson. Like McCullough, Ellis thinks more favorably of Adams and gives Jefferson almost a &quot;thumbs-down&quot;.I think Joseph Ellis's first chapter, &quot;The Generation&quot;, would have been better saved for the end, not the beginning. It is a summation much more than a preface. &quot;Founding Brothers&quot; is, however, an important addition to the literature concerning the great minds that helped shape our country and I highly recommend it.

For those of us who know Rudolph Valentino by name and by reputation only, Emily Leider's new biography, &quot;Dark Lover&quot; is a good place to start in order to understand this major silent screen star who died so young. I've only seen Valentino in short moments from some of his films and I bought the book wondering who the man in front of the camera was. To this end, Leider does not disappoint.The chronological layout is informative, especially when the author ties in Valentino's life directly with his films. The beginning of the book is slow and a little &quot;over the top&quot;...one knew very little about Valentino's youth spent in Italy, so Leider &quot;fills in&quot; a bit. But the narrative comes alive when he reaches the United States and especially after he acquires a certain amount of fame. If this weren't a book connected with Hollywood, the references to so many other stars that Valentino knew would be campy. But Leider knows how to tell a good story and how to use those around Valentino as wonderful (and sometimes hilarious!) props. The author's offerings about Pola Negri are worth the price of the book and made me laugh out loud.Emily Leider tidies up the end nicely. Many authors of biography often finish their books with the deaths of their subects, but this book ends with a fairly full accounting of those who surrounded Valentino in life and survived him. Many period photographs are included and they add to the text.As much as I enjoyed reading &quot;Dark Lover&quot;, in the end, I wonder if Rudolph Valentino really had enough substance to warrant over four hundred pages. Much of Leider's work revolves around the emotional ups and downs of Valentino; emotional swings that tend to become tiresome toward the end. However, it's an easy read and a pleasurable one, too.

"Saving Graces", the wonderful autobiography of Elizabeth Edwards, adds another dimension to a woman whose presence in the 2004 national campaign for the White House lit up the stage. At 5'2" Edwards is a giant in every other way...the experience of raising her children (and losing the oldest, Wade, who is central to the book) then going through the scary months of having breast cancer makes her story one of remarkable achievement and terrific understanding of the forces both with her and against.Beginning with a unique fact that few can match, (Elizabeth Edwards's four children were each born in a different decade) the author's compelling life unfolds with a description of her outgoing father. Moving from place to place as a child of a career military officer, Edwards gives him credit for allowing her to learn to be easy with people.....a trait which served her well during her husband John's campaign for the U.S. Senate and later, Vice President.There is no doubt throughout this quickly-paced book that Edwards places family above all else. Wade's death in a 1996 car accident and her cancer discovery eight years later may have knocked her down for a while but this is one resilient woman. Yet she doesn't go into hiding at either instance. She reaches out to her family and friends and finds the comfort she needs.Edwards writes with much compassion, of course, but also with a great sense of humor. Her reflections on the 2004 race are often hilarious. (Is it any wonder that John and Teresa Kerry had never eaten at a Wendy's restaurant and that they had a back-up plan if they didn't like the food?!) Vignettes like this one are terrific additions to this book where any and every emotion is out on display. I think it takes more than a fair amount of courage to write a book in the way that Elizabeth Edwards has written hers. I applaud her and admire her very much and I recommend you read "Saving Graces".

Laura Linney has been a favorite of mine ever since her days in "Tales of the City" and in "You Can Count on Me" she extends and broadens her appeal as Sammy, the overwrought mother, employee and sister to a man whose place in society has not yet been carved. Mark Ruffalo, in his breakout role as Linney's wayward brother Terry, gives an edgy and sensitive performance and it's no wonder his career took off after this film.What I particularly enjoyed about "You Can Count on Me" is the depth of devotion that both actors have for each other in their respective roles. Terry lives on the verge of defeat but even though he is aware of his shortcomings, tries in his own way to make things right with Sammy through befriending her son, Rudy. Sammy's being torn in all directions should make her take flight, but her internal thermostat is set just right as she flits between job, lover(s), mother and loyal sibling. Linney and Ruffalo may seem to be an odd pairing but it is one that works beautifully. I highly recommend "You Can Count on Me".

"Six Feet Under", the inventive and moving HBO series that ran for five seasons, is unlike any other that I've ever seen. From the opening theme (one of the best ever composed) through the largely sudden deaths that begin each episode to the rapport of the highly dysfunctional Fisher family, "Six Feet Under" deserves every award it ever received and then some.Each character in the show brings an important contribution to the family entity. Over time it's likely that the viewer will come to appreciate one character more than another but my favorite is Claire. She matures wonderfully throughout the five-year run and it is fitting that the series ends with her.While the dialogue occasionally lapses into melodrama, that's probably because the Fisher family is emotive with which to begin. Who wouldn't be, with a funeral home at its core? The final few episodes are so delicately handled that it was almost a shame to see the series end."Six Feet Under" is as innovative as they come, displaying great emotional character depth and latitude. It may take you the entire summer to view all the episodes but it's worth it and I highly recommend the viewer's taking time to enjoy it.

Having enjoyed last year's "Eats, Shoots and Leaves", I was more than happy to see Lynne Truss's new book, "Talk to the Hand". Easily readable in one sitting, the author has taken up her quill once more and this time we find her crusading against bad manners and rudeness. Shorter and more vitriolic than her previous book, Ms. Truss, nonetheless, stokes the fires of outrage with accuracy and humor. Using an oxymoron, one could refer to this book as "Truss unbound".Beginning with the simple words "please" and "thank you" she lays out this brief book by asking us "what ever happened to these words?" Indeed, they seem largely to have disappeared. I did nod my head in agreement when she got around to mentioning that the correct rejoinder to "thank you" is "you're welcome". These days, it seems "thank you" invites the response "no problem" or, even worse, "thank YOU!", which creates a vicious cycle of thankers and thankees.Ms. Truss's six good reasons to stay home and bolt the door include chapters on "My Bubble, My Rules" and "Someone Else Will Clean It Up". She saves her biggest charge about rudeness for cell phones (mobile phones in England) and their users....especially those users who ride trains. I give her a hearty "amen" with regard to that offensive behavior.Decidedly British in tone, "Talk to the Hand" has enough American comparison so as not to shut out readers in the colonies. My one criticism of the book is that it's too short.....if Ms. Truss had fleshed it out a bit more, it would have been a better read. However, she is true to form as she writes with wit and a fair amount of depth. I hope her next book is one solely about "pet peeves". She would be just the author to write it!

For those of us who have grown up at a time when we automatically spring ahead and fall back each year, Michael Downing has written a wonderfully detailed and hysterically funny book about Daylight Saving Time and the attempts to come to some justification and standardization for it. As he indicates, how does one "save" sunlight?Downing begins with Congress's passage of a Daylight Saving bill in 1918 only to be repealed a year later. The ensuing chaos is worth the price of the book. State legislatures, local governments and citizens up in arms tried (and often succeeded) in changing the time that would suit themselves or their constituents best. The book is full of witty anecdotes. On April 24, 1932 he cites two persons who "died" of DST....the first account tells of a Chicago woman who climbed a ladder to change her clock, fell, and broke her neck. On the same day a Pennsylvania man who was so concerned about getting together a petition to repeal Daylight Saving Time died of a heart attack. Downing, however, has many serious points in his references. I couldn't quite believe it when I read that for years China, geographically as large as the United States, had only one time zone!"Spring Forward" delves into the proponents and opponents of DST and how they've jockeyed for positions of power on the subject. It is an exposure of years of government dithering and Downing delivers a quick thrust of the knife into the heart of political cowardice. I heartily recommend this book as a quick, easy, informative and very funny read on the subject of Daylight Saving Time.

There are a few subjects that are difficult to discuss on any plane, but incest, even in film, is among the trickiest. Louis Malle's "Murmur of the Heart", now forty years old, is seamless in its approach and understanding, presenting what could happen when a mother and her son draw very close and it's made all the better by two brilliant stars under Malle's direction.The Dijon, France of 1954 is a long way from Anytown, USA of 2011, but in many ways this is not a film of mere innocence...it's one of subtle maturity where the story rings true at every level. Benoit Ferreux, the bony-kneed, teenage Laurent, is marvelous to watch as his understated but nonethelss passion-filled relationship with his mother unfolds. The mother, Lea Massari, is a gem as she tries to balance a marriage, a lover and Laurent. Her eyes tell the whole story. "Murmur of the Heart" is a treasure and should not be missed.

"Spanking the Donkey", Matt Taibbi's journal of the 2004 presidential campaign, is unlike any book of any campaign l've ever read. Resourceful, original and combative, Taibbi seeks to tell the story HIS way....and in doing so, uncovers the sham of those who run for president.While last year's presidential race seems distant now, the author reminds us that it wasn't too long ago we were enmeshed in an election that pitted two woefully inept men. Taibbi covered the Democratic primary season and then went undercover to work for Bush and although he slams Kerry mercilessly, he saves his best ammo for the current occupant in the White House.This book grew on me. For the first forty pages l was convinced that "Spanking the Donkey" was written by a man in his mid-thirties for an audience in their twenties. As the book continued, however, I became aware that Matt Taibbi is an exceptionally good writer. His narrative has rhythm and bite. He maintains humor throughout (which is not an easy thing to do) and he is refreshingly opinionated. For those of us who had the misfortune not to see his essays at their time of print, "Spanking the Donkey" is nonetheless a welcome retrospective to last year's hoopla.No matter what one's political persuasion is there is something in this book for everyone. (I especially liked his criticism of author Bob Woodward) Taibbi's main contribution is to underscore the fact that as bad as the candidates are and as bad as the journalists are who cover them, the whole idea of campaign issues has been lost to rhetoric. For this alone, but for many other reasons, I highly recommend "Spanking the Donkey". I hope Matt Taibbi has another book in mind.

Like "Stormy Weather", an all-black film also from 1943, "Cabin in the Sky" is a period piece and must be understood in the context of its time. While the film could not be made today it is a timely reminder of the stereotypes black actors were forced to confront, yet "Cabin in the Sky" offers some tender performances, especially between the ever-wise Petunia (Ethel Waters) and the well-meaning but hapless Little Joe (Eddie "Rochester" Anderson). There is a warmth to their relationship and Waters renders some lovely songs, especially the famous "Taking a Chance on Love"."Cabin in the Sky", Vincente Minnelli's debut as a film director, presents a contest between good and evil and the persuasions and choices we sometimes face. In this regard it has "Wizard of Oz" overtones, right down to the cyclone in each movie....they must have been the same! A hidden bonus is actor Kenneth Spencer, a noted bass/baritone of his day, who plays the part of the soulful reverend....his mellifluous speaking voice fine tunes each line he utters. Viewed in the historical sense, "Cabin in the Sky" is a fine film.

The 1945 film "The Picture of Dorian Gray", based on the novel by Oscar Wilde, is one of those period pieces that is of its time, but timeless. Dorian, played stoically by Hurd Hatfield, is the portrait himself. While some of the dialogue is stilted at the beginning, the film picks up the pace halfway through. George Sanders gives a stellar performance as the stiff, haughty Lord Henry Wotton.It's nice to see three young, rising stars in the film...Donna Reed, Angela Lansbury and Peter Lawford. All have smallish roles but each one is central to the story, with Lansbury particularly affecting in the early moments. Shot almost entirely in black and white, the few color scenes are arresting. This classic film has weathered well over the years and I highly recommend its viewing.

It occurred to me while reading "A Man Without a Country", Kurt Vonnegut's last offering, that we all have it in us to write a comparable book regarding our own lives. However, few of us could write in the style of Vonnegut, and his short but pointed book is well worth the hour or so it takes to read."A Man Without a Country" blends humor, fact, sarcasm, wit and a lifetime of observation. It is Andy Rooney, Garrison Keillor and George Carlin wrapped into a small package of good writing, Vonnegut-style, of course. Age brings perspective and with that Vonnegut has plenty on which to comment. As one who survived the bombing of Dresden in 1945, the author has an earned platform to speak about war and he does so quite often in this book. But it's his humor, often black but always funny, that propels things along. Vonnegut, a humanist, addressed a group of fellow humanists upon the death of Isaac Asimov. He told the assemblage, "Isaac is up in heaven now". Vonnegut goes on to say, "it was the funniest thing I could have said to an audience of humanists. I rolled them in the aisles. It was several minutes before order could be restored." Lines like that give a warmth to the book, yet he saves his best line for "W". Vonnegut says, "...do you know why I think George W. Bush is so pissed off at Arabs? They brought us algebra". With that comment I had to take a minute or so away from the book to wipe the tears from my eyes.I highly recommend "A Man Without a Country" for its appealing nature and visionary comment. Kurt Vonnegut departed this life with just the right things left to say. I could add that "Kurt is up in heaven now", but I wouldn't want to get my fellow humanists going. The book is a pleasure.

New York, like no other city in the world, is a city of spectacular heights and many books have been written about the buildings that rise to the skies. How many people, however, think about what lies beneath the vast weight of edifices and human life that exists above the ground? In this compelling and instructive book, Anne-Marie Cantwell and Diana diZerega Wall have a given us a lesson not only about the artifacts and remains that have lain dormant for centuries but also in the history that surrounds their burial and ultimate exposure.In a time-line fashion (11,000 years before present to today) the authors reconstruct a picture of what life might have been like during these times. Lest one think the unearthings are limited to Manhattan, they are not. All five boroughs are represented. There were moments during the reading of this book that I wanted the authors to spend more time recounting the actual excavations to which they refer, but in the end their historical perspective is the link that saves the day. Without it, their offerings would be no more than a field trip.My future trips around the city will be made with a new awareness as I ask myself, &quot;I wonder what lies beneath....&quot;. It is a question we all can ask.

Some of the best books I have ever read have been ones not of my own choosing. This is the case with "The Inextinguishable Symphony", a book given to me by a friend for a recent birthday. It became one of my most cherished gifts.I am a music teacher and roughly the same age as the author, Martin Goldsmith. I must confess that I had never heard of the "Kulturbund" and certainly had not an inkling as to the effect it had on so many lives. This is one of those accounts that is not taught in school, and like "Schindler's List", presents a brand new aspect to life in Nazi Germany. Mr. Goldsmith weaves a marvelous chronicle of his parents' devotion to each other in the years with the Kubu, an organization that found them together and bound them together.In historical terms, many of us believed for years that everything had to have been clear in Germany in the 1930s....if you were Jewish you had to leave. The author reminds us that many Jews who did leave early on also came back and subsequently met their deaths as the situation got worse. This book is a loving tribute not only to Mr. Goldsmith's parents but to all who tried to find some happiness in music and friendship at a most difficult time. It is a wonderful memorial to those who perished and a testament to those who survived.

I recently viewed "Kiss Me, Guido", for the fourth or fifth time since it was released years ago and it is as sweet, funny and charming as it always was. Clueless Frankie has to escape his stifling family situation and when the right living arrangement pops up, well, Frankie jumps at it. But it's not anything like he expected and the film has many hilarious moments.In the end, "Kiss Me, Guido" has less to do with sexuality and more to do with loyalty. There is a warm satisfaction to this film that continues to give out even after several viewings. I highly recommend it.

"Do You Speak American?" is another fine contribution by Robert MacNeil and William Cran, coauthors of "The Story of English". As this is a companion book to the televised series this recent offering does not stand alone but serves as the program's enhancement.Those of us who have followed Mr. MacNeil through his many journeys around the world in search of the ways English is enriched will find worthy chapters in "Do You Speak American?" Highlighted areas include the South, Hispanics and Black English....these three chapters encompass close to half of the book. Mr. MacNeil delivers his findings in his usual straightforward, buttoned-down Nova Scotia style. That isn't to say there isn't any humor...there is...but his earnestness keeps everything on track.My disappointment in "Do You Speak American?" is that it doesn't cover enough ground. While "The Story of English" was a major undertaking, this seems puny by comparison. It was as if the book was written almost in haste to accommodate the tv program (which, by the way, is better than the book). The north and the midwest get far less attention so the book has an unbalanced feeling to it. That said, the portions that the authors delve into most carry a certain fascination and the narrative style to which we have been accustomed is as flawless as ever. The final chapter is an odd one, but an important one....how computers take on their own "language" and how that affects us. Some of the best (and most humorous) paragraphs in the book deal with the speech-recognition system in BMWs and the reaction of owners to it.Perhaps Mr. MacNeil and Mr. Cran will do a follow-up to "Do You Speak American?" I hope they do. There's so much more to discover and these coauthors are just the men to continue looking into the many facets of "American English".

Peter Krass's biography, "Carnegie", is a terrific look at a man whose name most of us have known all of our lives, but whose life has remained something of a mystery. The name "Carnegie" evokes thoughts of money and power and in this mature biography, Krass has managed to give us a thorough look at Andrew Carnegie, from his hardscrabble boyhood days in Scotland, to his eventual rise to the top of the business world and to the monetary charity that marked his final years.Not only does the author spend time writing about Carnegie's achievements but he is careful to include the emotional state of his subject. Carnegie could be petty and vicious one minute then caring and loving the next. How that affected his business as well as his personal life is what makes this book so engrossing.While most of us know that Andrew Carnegie made his millions in the steel business, his knowledge of other businesses and how they intertwined with his own (especially the railroads) is fascinating. Through his gift-giving for the erection of hundreds of libraries around the world he made sure that Andrew Carnegie's name would be remembered for generations. No small ego here! It would seem that the author has given Carnegie a balanced look with the good side outweighing the bad in the final analysis.What I gleaned from Peter Krass is a part of Andrew Carnegie about which I hadn't known...his efforts in the "peace movement" of his day. How firmly committed to the abolishment of war was Carnegie and his means to that end are cleary laid out in this biography. Carnegie's close working relationships and correspondence with every president from Cleveland to Wilson is offered by Krass, giving an added bonus to those of us who enjoy biographies of U.S. presidents, and it marks some of the lighter moments of the book as Krass relates how Carnegie liked to meddle in the affairs of state, often without invitation.Through all of Andrew Carnegie's duplicity and vindictiveness toward his own workers and colleagues as he rose to the top, he more than made up for it in his philanthropic works later in life. Carnegie was that "rare breed" and Peter Krass has captured all of it.

It is Christmas, 1183 and aging King Henry II of England meets with his estranged wife Eleanor of Aquitaine to decide which of their three sons will inherit the kingdom upon Henry's death. Each has a favorite and one must be chosen, and through deception, torment, connivance and deceit the "family" follows through in their respective roles. It is a wonderful story and though the outcome is in doubt, one thing is certain....there will never be another Christmas like this one!Strong performances are universally good in "The Lion in Winter" and Katharine Hepburn earned a much deserved Academy Award. It's a shame that Peter O'Toole didn't win as well, as the two are equally matched for spark-flying drama. A third dazzling performance is turned in by a young Timothy Dalton as King Philip of France.Though as much as the drama is perfected, "The Lion in Winter" (1968) hasn't particularly worn the test of time well. The dialogue is kitschy, (sometimes unintentionally funny) and the dysfunction is all too broad. Emotions change faster than you can snap your fingers, so many of the scenes don't play out as well as they should. That said however, "The Lion in Winter" is worth seeing for Hepburn, O'Toole and Dalton. On that score, you won't be disappointed.

Ted Scheu is at it again. This fabulously funny amasser of children's poetry has given kids another reason to smile. And not just kids....their parents, too!The author's collected works, this being the latest, reflect a profound understanding of how the mind of a kid works.

As a harbinger to "North By Northwest", Alfred Hitchcock devised a brilliant, crisp ending to "Saboteur" by setting up a confrontation between good and evil atop the Statue of Liberty. True to form, the director excels at these last-minute flights downward and "Saboteur" is no exception. It's a Hitchcock classic.Nicely cast with an impressive young Robert Cummings as the lead, "Saboteur" is a terrific look into America in the early days of the Second World War. Wrongly accused of arson and murder, Barry Kane, (Cummings) begins a flight from "the authorities" which takes him (and an unsuspecting love interest) from California to New York. One of the side comic benefits of this film is the dated, cheesy language, which gives it an extra attraction. But Hitchcock had his own comic moments in mind that work just fine. Encountering a circus troupe at night during one of the legs of his flights, Cummings is introduced to a cadre of performers, the funniest of which is the bearded lady with her beard done up in curlers for the night! Were it not for the midget and the platitudes that the film keeps offering, I would have said that "Saboteur" had its roots in "The Wizard of Oz", produced three years earlier.As a suspense, "Saboteur" is not up there with later Hitchcock films, but it does give Cummings a stage for some fine acting, not to mention the often overlooked wonderful character actor Norman Lloyd, whose small but important role is central to the film. I highly recommend "Saboteur" for its fine cast and terse direction.

Linda Greenhouse has written an extraordinary book about the life and career of one of the great Supreme Court justices of our time, Harry A. Blackmun. In doing so she has given us, in "Becoming Justice Blackmun", a remarkable behind-the-scenes look at not only Blackmun but the interaction among the justices of the court. She succeeds brilliantly.Blackmun's encounter with destiny was certainly not in the cards early on for this man from Minnesota. Greenhouse explores Blackmun's early career and most notably his longtime friendship with Warren E. Burger, with whom he would serve on the Supreme Court for sixteen years. Their friendship is a central theme in her book...a friendship that would falter and eventually dissolve. At every turn the author's narrative flows warmly and vividly as she paints a most impressive picture of the man who would become the center of controversy in Roe v. Wade. Greenhouse reflects accurately on Blackmun, a shy, soft-spoken man, whose studious manner often led to agonizing decisions. Nonetheless, those decisions were carefully crafted and always thoughtful.This could have been a dry effort on Greenhouse's part but she spices it up with tales of humor. Like kids at school, the justices passed amusing notes back and forth among themselves and even had a betting pool for the 1992 presidential election. It has always been rumored that the court closely follows presidential elections but I had no idea that they took it this far!What emerges finally is the author's extensive research and knowledge of not only the court but Blackmun, especially. Through detailed accounts of some of the most important court cases (effectively explained for those of us who are not accustomed to the law) she connects those cases with Blackmun's personal reflections about them and how he dealt with other justices. Blackmun was unflappable at times but willing to make changes in his own arguments when necessary. Greenhouse covers all of this with obvious admiration for her subject but with an objectivity that lends itself to an impartial overall view of Harry Blackmun."Becoming Justice Blackmun" is a tour de force. There are few opportunities to have such a look at the Supreme Court and its inner workings and having been granted an opportunity to write this book, Linda Greenhouse has made a significant contribution to our nation's history.

I first saw "Little Children" in January and thought it was spectacular. When I viewed it again recently I was able to absorb some of the undercurrents I missed the first time. And undercurrents there are in droves. The story is complex and challenging but it is the film's cast that shines.Kate Winslet gives her best performance yet as Sarah, the young suburban housewife and mother, desperate for love. She meets Brad (Patrick Wilson) who is in a similar emotional boat. The two form a bond and the rest is for the audience to witness. Winslet, with her longing, soul-searching eyes is a perfect match for Wilson (played with vacuous detachment). Wilson, who reminds me of a young Paul Newman, gives a wonderful performance. Added to the fine group of actors is Jackie Earle Haley, (Ronnie) the scary sexual pervert just out of prison. The scene where we meet him in the pool is reminiscent of a film from a generation ago. Real kudos go to Phyllis Somerville, who plays Ronnie's mom. Her small role is crucial to the plot and she plays it with aplomb. The deep-voiced narrator keeps the story line together and is a welcome, reassuring addition.Everyone in this film seems to be trapped...as if they're on a faster and faster spinning carousel with no way off. In the end they all exit in tragic, but sensible ways. The title "Little Children" applies more to the adults, who can't seem to take responsiblity to a mature level and end up paying a huge price. The film is worth every minute of viewing and I highly recommend it.

"Phoenix" will never win any awards for being a terrific film but it has a touching story line and a couple of nice performances. What happens when two men get dumped by the same guy? Well, of course, they meet and fall for each other. Chad Bartley and Jeff Castle may not be the perfect match but for a good part of the film they share an understanding....and a bed. "Phoenix" is just satisfying enough to recommend.

Niccolo Ammaniti's &quot;I'm Not Scared&quot; is a small wonder. Told in a pulsating, dramatic fashion it is the story of a boy, Michele, who risks everything to save another boy his age, Filippo, as the circumstances surrounding Filippo change. Ammaniti's book is one where the children bear the maturity and the adults are rendered needy of care.&quot;Im Not Scared&quot; is a tale of the heart. The reader roots for Michele at every turn and watches him as he battles his own fears only to turn them into a breathless triumph. The author beautifully gives a picture of the wheat fields of southern Italy and the &quot;aliveness&quot; of a small town that would otherwise be described as sleepy. Distances and time are presented in a desirably vague way, increasing our imagination of the bravura of Michele.The one downside is the English translation by Jonathan Hunt. (no relation to me!) It is obviously translated into &quot;British English&quot; so many of the words and phrases are confusing. A better translation for Americans would have made the read a little less jumbled and more satisfying. Still, &quot;I'm Not Scared&quot; is a book not to be missed and can easily be a treasured read of an evening.

For those of us who have spent time in a bar....or rather, significant time in a bar, J. R. Moehringer's new book, "The Tender Bar" will be a trip down memory lane, whether past or present. In large part, he succeeds in this elongated autobiography.This book is about one's favorite local haunt, to be sure, but it has less to do with Dickens/Publicans than it has to do with the author's own coming-of-age story. As a friend recently remarked, the local tavern, for all its ups and downs, is the last vestige of testosterone. Exploring that angle, Moehringer does well.While Moehringer describes the scene in Manhasset in great detail he has offered a book that never quite gets off the ground. His male characters are devoid of much warmth although he insists that they gave him a start and direction toward maleness that he lacked due to an absent father. He's much more successful in describing his relationship with his mother... in fact, the women in Moehringer's life are the real sustaining forces. The book needs some serious editing but all that aside I like the author's style. He made me laugh out loud on many a page given his just this side or that side of Raymond Chandler sense of humor."The Tender Bar" is not for every reader but if you're willing to slug it out (in a reader's sense) it very well might be worth the read. J. R. Moehringer has presented a good book, if not a great one, but he has a way with language and humor that one would like to re-visit in a future book.

"Yossi and Jagger", a short, powerful film depicts the title characters (Israeli soldiers) with a deep, if not all that secretive love on the battlefield. That love is tested from several sides and becomes a terrific equalizing bit of cinema. It would be hard to imagine an American director making this film.With the realm of war surrounding the Israeli platoon, "Yossi and Jagger" comes to grips with sexuality in the military. The last few minutes of the film are delivered with great pathos and care. It is a wonderful hour-plus look at how love conquers all and I highly recommend "Yossi and Jagger".

Jasper Becker's recent book, "Rogue Regime" is really two books in one. The bulk of it is a history and analysis of North Korea, revolving around its current leader, Kim Jong Il and his father, Kim Il Sung. Authoritatively documented and seriously presented, Becker outlines a case against the world's most horrendous and brutal dictator. His prognostications, however, leave much to be desired.In "Rogue Regime", the author spends chapter upon chapter relating the devastation that the Kims have brought to North Korea. In this regard, Becker has done a great service in reminding us what it is like to live in that totalitarian state. He looks at all angles.... political, social, economical and most of all, personal, citing defectors who have lived in North Korea over the years. He describes Pyongyang as a city which is almost Kafka-esque.....department stores that are open with nothing to buy and few shoppers, for instance. For a country that is closed to the outside world Becker opens it up, as much as he can.To say that the author has a neo-conservative bent is an understatement. He castigates Presidents Carter and Clinton and relegates the United Nations to a role of an appeaser in the quest to figure out what to do with North Korea. While there is much merit to his arguments, the one-sided approach he offers is hardly convincing. Becker loosely addresses Iraq, largely supporting the U.S. effort there, but he then goes on to beg the question that so many people have asked over the course of the current Bush administration.....if North Korea poses the real threat to the United States, what are we doing in Iraq and why are we not doing anything militarily to take out the supposed sites in North Korea? It's a question that is posed but left unanswered.I have reservations about this book but anyone who is curious to know more about North Korea should read it. Still, reading "Rogue Regime" is like driving down a highway without an exit ramp. The trip is worthwhile but it eventually just stops. One wishes that this book had been written a few years ago and that President Bush had read it. The fulcrum of the "Axis of Evil" might have been tipped in a different direction. While pointing the finger, Becker delivers no real solutions.

"Weekend", a love story about two men (Russell and Glen) who meet, share a couple of days together then part, has its moments. Unfortunately those moments don't come until well into the film. The first hour of the film is tedious and boring...I felt no sympathy to either of the main characters. The sound editing is very poor and the dialogue banal. But at one point the two men are sitting with each other in a chair discussing gay marriage and that's where "Weekend" begins to pick up. When Glen has just hours to go before moving to America, the two share many tender moments and the final scene at the train station brings the film to a satisfying conclusion.This could have been a much better film in many ways, but it's worth a look. If one can get through that first hour, then stick with it to the end.

"No End in Sight'" is a perfect literal title for what has happened in Iraq. Given the words of Rumsfeld, Bush and others, the film takes a hands-on approach that works to convey the ongoing waste of lives and the destruction of a country. Bush will undoubtedly pay the historic price for this tragedy and the film documents every aspect of it well. Listen to the people who really tried to be helpful in Iraq...they are the heroes of "No End in Sight" and their collective skepticism is noteworthy and welcome. This film should be viewed by every American.

The relationship of mother and son has been explored for decades in film and this poignant, light comedy from several years ago revisits that relationship. Trying to find out why his mother and he have never quite gotten along, Albert Brooks, as a middle-aged adult, moves back in with his mom to try and sort things out."Mother" is a film that centers on the many talents of Debbie Reynolds. She's not quite daft enough to be "dotty" but just enough into her dotage to seem slip-sliding away. The writing in this film is surprisingly even and often wonderfully humorous, providing the viewer with a better-than-expected refreshing comedy. "Mother" is worth your visit.

Like a warrior returning from the Crusades, Michael Moore has come back.....this time with cannons blasting all around! Hey, is this guy something else or what?? He makes Carville and Tucker look like the Bobsey twins.Michael takes on just about everyone in power. If you think that "Dubya" is in WAY over his head (as I do) this book is for you. And he's entertaining on top of it. Michael Moore is at his best when he goes after D.C. folk who don't look after our country's "infrastructure"....i.e. education, to name just one. And he's dead on when he attacks the national Democrats....wimps, all of them. I mean, can't one of them stand up to the idiot-in-chief?Problem is this book is all ammo. Moore, marginalized, is great in the short-term and lousy with answers. Oh sure, he gives you names, e-mail addresses, etc. of people in power to contact to register your protest, but his pie-in-the-sky stuff is exactly meant for the people who are vulnerable....young voters. By the way, they don't vote much after all. Hey, Mikey.....your bit about Ralph Nader was pretty pathetic.....got news for you...RALPH NADER GAVE US GEORGE BUSH. And that Green Party ain't goin' nowhere but down. Forget the Supreme Court, butterfly ballots and minor party candidates. Your defense of Ralphie looked defensive and squeamish.All of that said, I'd encourage you to buy this book. Michael Moore makes you think. And he's right lots of the time. I just wish he didn't come across like a left-wing Bill O'Reilly. Both are like professional wrestling referees....pointing out the bad things but rather helpless in setting things straight. Heck, Mike, you're not as smarmy as O'Reilly.

Erik Larson's new book, "The Devil in the White City" is simply terrific. The juxtaposition of the stories of architect Daniel Burnham and killer H. H. Holmes centered by the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 is deftly handled and Larson provides rich color in its telling. It's a hard book not to read in one sitting.While Burnham's account is related in a straightforward manner, Holmes's is not. Slowly, the author builds up the wickedness in Holmes and it is not until the last few chapters of the book that the massive evil deeds of the murderer come to light. If there ever was a tale of good and bad happening in the same city at the same time, this is it.Larson gives a good deal of historical perspective to the planning and building of the fair. He takes much pride in the detail and loves numbers. Statistics are inserted throughout the book, but never in a dry way....they are always directly relevant to the story. And what a nice sidelight regarding the first-ever Ferris wheel!I appreciated the postscript of Larson's book. Many authors leave their readers at a loss as to what happened to the characters. The author finishes them out to their collective dying days. Don't be surpised if you find yourself asking if the events in this book actually happened. It could have been a book of well-written fiction, but it is not....this is real history. Erik Larson has done a masterful job in balancing the lives of two men and the strange and wonderful people who surrounded them.

I first remember hearing about the USS Indianapolis when I was a boy from Dr. Lew Haynes, himself...(Dr. Haynes was married to Elizabeth Dodge, my mother's first cousin). Since then the story has remained fresh in my mind as one of the most tragic but in many ways heroic sagas from World War II. Doug Stanton has put together a moving and important account of the ship's sinking and aftermath.Almost sixty years after the ship went down it remains hard to fathom that so many errors could have occurred in not keeping track of the whereabouts of the Indianapolis. The fact that the ship played such a pivotal role just before its demise (the delivery of the atom bomb parts to Tinian) puts the story in an even more macabre light; hundreds of seamen did not live long enough to know the importance of their mission.The stories told by the survivors as they endured shark attacks, blistering sun, a lack of drinking water, fuel oil all around them, broken limbs, delirium, and for most of them, death, is of such shocking proportion that the term &quot;hero&quot; is almost not enough to bestow on each of them. Captain McVay's court-martial and eventual suicide has always been a sad epilogue to the whole chronicle. Stanton tells of the dozens of letters from families of the Indianapolis who for years after the tragedy blamed him for the loss of their loved ones and how McVay carried that with him to his own death.The silver lining to be found in &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; is that survival against incredible odds can and does happen and that we need to be reminded of what it takes to be faced with such adversity. This book is a tribute to the survivors of the Indianapolis and their brethren who perished.

Paul Krugman, the able-minded economist-turned-columnist, has done the country a great service with his new book &quot;The Great Unraveling&quot;. So many of us tend to see the United States through the eyes of politicians, sound bites and slanted news but Krugman tells it like it is and doesn't mince words in doing so. Sure, he has his own bias and he is unashamed of telling the readers just that. But his insight comes from letting us know how the country has become &quot;unraveled&quot; during the Bush administration with regard to miscues, bad judgment and an overall wrong direction with regard to the economic standing of the United States....not just here at home but around the world.I would guess that most readers know little about the economy and certainly far less than the author but here's Krugman's greatest strength.... he's a teacher. He gives us examples about why certain policies have failed, explaining how those policies happened, the effect on the economy and the potential for more of these mistakes to be made. The great mistake that conservatives make about liberals is that they tend to view us as &quot;gloom and doom&quot; prophets and Krugman alludes to this in his book, but I think that without his exposing the lies and misdeeds of Bush and his &quot;handlers&quot; more economic hanky-panky would certainly ensue.My reason for not giving the book five stars lies in my agreement with several other reviewers. The book jumps around too much. It needs a central thread to keep the reader in place and too often we're jumping from one crisis to another. I found myself having to remember back a few years ago to what was happening in Japan or Argentina, for instance. But that is more a matter of style than of substance. Paul Krugman has laid out a definitive case against this administration....an administration that has tried to bull its way through, cooking numbers as it goes without much regard for those who disagree and caring little for world opinion. He correctly ties economic decisions to politics and for that reason alone, Krugman has been a great contributor to the debate going on regarding the direction of this country. I highly recommend &quot;The Great Unraveling&quot;.

Thomas Frank's new book &quot;What's the Matter With Kansas?&quot; takes a different approach to recent books that have lambasted the Bush administration and their followers. He gets to the core question...why so many Republicans don't vote their economic interests. Frank adds another implication.....much of the Republican party has become reactive, even more so in the past twenty-five years than it was when I was growing up. His native Kansas is a good place to look at where the Republican party has gone and why so many people in the rest of the country, who once were Republicans, have left.The author also says that for all the yelling and screaming that the right does, much of their agenda never gets anywhere. I suspect that the &quot;Mods&quot; to whom Frank refers have more actual power than we might think and that as the country inches leftward the &quot;Cons&quot; eventually will have no place to go.Thomas Frank is a thoughtful author who has contributed much to the political dialogue this year. &quot;What's the Matter with Kansas?&quot; is a book well worth reading and one that just might give the reader a different slant as to how the country is shaping up.

With a first-rate all-female cast, director Pedro Almodovar has deliverd a mesmerizing film replete with intrigue and humor. Leading the cast is Penelope Cruz as the domineering Raimunda...a woman who is not below burying her dead husband before the police can ever ask questions. Equally good as Irene, Raimunda's mother, is Carmen Maura, whose facial expressions give us some of the most wonderful moments of "Volver". No American director that I can think of can get into the psyche like Almodovar. Each of his characters show pathos and love to a depth that keeps your eyes fixed on the screen. "Volver" is not to be missed.

Robert Stone's "Prime Green" is an astounding look back at a time that increasing few of us remember with such clarity as the author. It is not only a book about the 1960s, but it is written in the language of the sixties, full of the swirls of the era. Juxtaposed with national and international events, Stone reminds us that the sixties, far from being a nebulous and heady decade was anything but...it was the last clearly defined decade in our recent history and those years that have followed are really more the blur.Beginning with his service in the United States Navy in the late 1950s and ending with an acceptance of a teaching position in 1971, Stone travels to and fro...California, New York, London and a timely visit to Vietnam as a journalist toward the end of the war. Along the way he marries, has kids and is soaked up by the counterculture of the time. This is his "On the Road", but updated with reflections. It is also a paean to his longtime friend, Ken Kesey.What makes "Prime Green" so appealing is his narrative and in this regard Robert Stone is a master writer. His ability to put the reader in his own shoes as he walks the mountains of California or contributes to a tabloid on the east coast is sheer joy. This is not so much a book about nostalgia as it is a celebration of the times. Anyone who lived during those years will recognize himself in Stone's opus, weed or LSD aside. Drifting in and out of drugs and employment Stone, nevertheless, managed to find creativity and income, often at the same time. While he makes some reflective comparisons at the end of "Prime Green" he is never mawkish. The author uses a broad brush to highlight the decade without forgetting the details."Prime Green" is refreshing and candid...it is also a highly effective read in one sitting. While at one point Stone, having had his first book published, worried about how and when a second book would ever take shape. The good news is that his eighth book is a winner and I highly recommend it.

I read Ron Christie's new book as I was looking to find some insight into how the Bush White House works. Having seen the author on a number of tv programs he comes across as earnest, forthright and dedicated to the conservative cause. Unfortunately, he hasn't been in the top echelon of decision-making to warrant a good book. It's too low-level.I wish Mr. Christie well.....there's nothing more in his book that we already know, would care to know or will find out sooner or later.

For those of us who were old enough to see "Making Love" when it first came out over a quarter century ago, a second look is well worth it. At the time, this film was considered groundbreaking, if not overly deep, but one is reminded that this was a pre-AIDS era and one where gay themes had not yet been tackled in a two-hour film.The story is simple enough...a triangulation of people in love and a marriage which fails due not to any malicious intent. While the acting is not exactly gripping, it does have a poignancy and relevance to 2008. "Making Love" could be made today with some minor changes, but the core of the film is good.

Any of us who came of baseball age during the brief years when Sandy Koufax ruled pitching will be rewarded by reading Jane Leavy's new book. As I started reading I was immediately reminded of a phrase from Simon and Garfunkel's song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;. The words are &quot;where have you gone Joe DiMaggio&quot; and the same could be said here.....what ever happened to Sandy Koufax?Leavy's Koufax book is less a biography, however, than a valentine. She tips her hand to the reader early in the book and it is clear that she is enamored of her subject. But after all, who wouldn't be? As Leavy points out throughout her book, Sandy Koufax represented decency, determination and talent and those of us who remember him from the 1960s always knew that he had these wonderful qualities. The author refreshingly reminds us that this is indeed the case.I liked her style of interspersing chapters of Sandy Koufax's life with an inning-by-inning account of his last no-hitter in 1965. Leavy has a good feel for drama and it was fascinating to know that there is no video of the game....just a couple of minutes of film and a taped radio account. How quickly we forget how far we've come in the world of television.There are some weak points. Chapter One is tedious and largely unconnected with the rest of the book. I'm sure more than a few readers will stop reading on when they get mired down here. Leavy's referrals to Sandy Koufax's &quot;Jewishness&quot; are overdone as is her weight on Koufax's pitching in pain. I think the book's largest hole is that we really don't learn much about Sandy Koufax, other than what others say about him. Yes, the former Dodger great may want to avoid publicity but when a book contains more information from friends and colleagues rather than the subject himself, something is missing. If there hadn't been references to Sandy Koufax's presence today, one might conclude that he had died.Still, Jane Leavy has resurrected a man whom many of us miss. In this regard she has done a great service not only for those whose memories of Sandy Koufax go back forty years, but for those who now come of age in baseball. And what a pitcher he was!

For those of us lucky enough to remember President Kennedy and his family, this retrospective about his son John, couldn't come at a better time. With all the rage of war in Iraq it's nice to think about a time when life was more at ease. This book helps.John Kennedy was not a hero or a saint. He was a son of a president who tried to make a life on his own against tremendous odds. Yes, he had things going in his favor, but he also had talent, courage and died far too young. Study the photos of this man. We are not a country of kings, queens or princes. But we did have John Kennedy for a few, brief years, and I think we were all the better for it.

A recent book I was reading mentioned "The Boys in the Band", a movie I haven't seen since its release in 1970. I watched it again and was struck by the timelessness of the film. A friend's birthday party turns into an evening of camp and then rage, as several gay men become overly bitchy with one another...and violent.Could this film be made today? Yes, and I think it would have a similar appeal. Much of the undercurrent in "The Boys in the Band" has never really changed, even with the continuing social acceptance of gays over time. This was a wonderful film when it came out and should be viewed again, especially by those who haven't seen it in years.

" A People Adrift", Peter Steinfels's new book about the crisis in the Catholic Church in America is as comprehensive a study as you will find about the church today. For those of us non-Catholics who wonder why Catholics go through all the fuss and bother that they do, Steinfels helps us out. Most importantly, he gets us away from the screaming headlines of the newspapers and the segments on television and gives us a close-up look at the many layers of Catholicism, how they interact, what's wrong (and what's right) in the church today.What struck me most about "A People Adrift" is how much lay leadership has become a part of the church. With declining numbers of priests Steinfels points to the increasing role of laity....a sure sign that at least in some respects the church is willing to accept change. But the author reserves his harshest criticism for the hunkering down of Rome with regard to women and celibacy. He suggests that without a liberalization on the part of the Vatican that the Catholic church in the U.S. will continue its decline. As an outsider in a progressive Protestant denomination, I very much agree with him.Although the author is willing to make his own feelings known, he is careful to balance counter arguments. He offers possible solutions to questions about the Catholic perceptions of sex, celibacy, religious education, the roles of priests and bishops, the state of affairs of worship, etc....in short, Steinfels covers just about every tier and angle. And I smiled when he signaled his great respect for the late Cardinal Bernardin and his contempt for Cardinal Law.While "A People Adrift" is a must-read for Catholics who are concerned about the future of their church, I think this book extends far beyond Catholicism. It is an important book to read for people of any faith, not just as a comparison to their own but as a revelation to those who want to understand the joy and the agony of what it is to be Catholic in America in 2003.

Dysfunction. That word that few my age ever heard growing up but know so well now is the key element of Lee Montgomery's wonderful memoir about her parents. It is also a testimonial to strength in coming together with her siblings as she did when their father was dying. Survival for the author was paramount as she had to make dozens of balancing decisions not only about her father's care but also her mother's alcoholism.There isn't much humor in "The Things Between Us" and one needs to approach this book with a sense of this, but along the way there is much color...the New England sky, for instance, stands out as one example. The seriousness with which she confronts her own growing up (now at age fifty or thereabouts) is inspirational for those of us, age-related, who know about dysfunction and dying parents."The Things Between Us" is highly recommended for anyone who has been through or is going through the parental care process. When one becomes a parent to one's own parents, perspective of life changes dramatically. I applaud Lee Montgomery for giving us her story.

Ian McEwan's "Atonement", now an Academy Award-nominated film, has drawn a second look at the novel, originally published in 2002. The author has taken a terrific idea for a story and spun it to where it almost works. Save for some irregular pacing, it is, in many ways, a fascinating book."Atonement", a young girl's lifelong search for forgiveness, begins with such a dynamism that it is hard to think that the following chapters could be anything less. Seen through the eyes of the thirteen-year-old protagonist, Briony Tallis, (herself a dark and rigid soul) life is never quite as it is, but rather as it should be. With all sorts of cross purposes, sisterly "protectiveness" and a coming of age sexual awakening, a series of events over the course of an evening propel Briony to make the mistake of a lifetime...the false accusation of a crime which the alleged perpetrator (Robbie) did not commit. As old age creeps up on Briony and with most of the principals dead or dying, she makes a final attempt at reconciliation...at least with herself.The main problem with "Atonement" is its drawn out middle section. The pages relating to Robbie's war service in and around Dunkirk spend most of the capital that McEwan has built up to this point. Added to that is Briony's service as a nurse (now at eighteen) in London around that same time. Fleshing out these characters is one thing, but that nice pace, achieved early on, simply runs out of steam."Atonement" is worth the read for the creativity of the plot and much of the interaction of the characters... both attractive and integral to the book. Yet with some editing, this could have been a brilliant offering by an otherwise terrific author. I recommend "Atonement" with the aforementioned caveats.

Timothy Egan's "The Worst Hard Time" proffers a look at the Dust Bowl from a slightly different perspective than most Americans are familiar...he tells it from the inside out. This is not a book about the Okies who packed up and moved west. "The Worst Hard Time" puts its focus on citizens of Dalhart, Texas and Boise City, Oklahoma (to name few) and details their struggles to survive years of drought and misery. To Egan's credit, it's a good start.The author is at his best when he chronicles an overall view of what it was like to live in the Dust Bowl...an area that stretched from the Texas panhandle to southern Nebraska and included portions of six states. He reminds us that the cause of the problems during a decade-long recurrence of "dusters" were largely man-made. The rape of native grasslands through plowing so weakened the soil and existing plants that the land was ripe for storms on the magnitude of which he describes. Egan, as an historian, informs well, although after mentioning several times that the dusters caused terrific amounts of static electricity, (enough to knock down a man) he never gives us a clue as to how or why that electricity accumulated its power.The problem with this book is that the narrative is as dry as the conditions upon which he comments. The half dozen or so people whom the author settles upon don't seem to win much more than a skirting empathy as one wonders if they really weren't well enough put together to follow their neighbors away. Except for some wonderful diary entries by Don Hartwell of Inavale, Nebraska (who stayed until the bitter end) and a chapter on Black Sunday, Egan misses terrific opportunities to liven up his own work. A storyteller he is not.There are many surviviors still around from those days on the High Plains. It would be nice to see a book about their experiences told in their own words, as Don Hartwell had done. "The Worst Hard Time" delivers some good information, but unlike the dusters, it never gets off the ground.

"Coming Out Under Fire", a short but reflective documentary based on a book of the same name by the late Allan Berube, gives heed to what is still one of the most egregious governmental policies in existence today....."Don't Ask, Don't Tell". The film, where surviving members of the military discuss their service during the Second World War, is at times empathetic but often maddening. The final exchange between Senator John Warner and Colonel Margarethe Cammermeyer regarding the implementation of this policy ends the film with a bang.This is a film that offers up how little progress has been made over the years regarding gays serving in the military. As many of these veterans had to lie to avoid persecution from within the military ranks and prosecution from without, "Coming Out Under Fire" also reminds us of how gays who serve today still have to keep mum about their sexual orientation to stay in the service. It's a good and necessary film, and I highly recommend it.

I came away from reading David Rockefeller's &quot;Memoirs&quot; with a reflection and a question. The reflection is this: I can't think of another individual who has had the extraordinary good fortune to interact with so many leaders around the globe, both in the political world as well as the business world for an entire lifetime, as David Rockefeller has done. His life, in that regard, would be hard to reproduce today. My question is, simply, why did Rockefeller write this book? After all, as he states, he is the first and only Rockefeller to tell the &quot;Rockefeller story&quot;.As the author says, he was largely ignored by his older siblings growing up and more or less went it alone. He did carve out a highly successful career as one of the leading bankers in the world, whose advice was sought after by prominent people from all walks of life. To this end, one must give David Rockefeller his due, not ignoring his place of noble birth. It must be hard to start at the top and work across. Regarding philanthropy, he correctly points out that those who wish to take issue with his enormous wealth disregard the good that his giving has done over the years. And yes, we hear about it all. David Rockefeller may be the quiet one, but his ego matches his siblings'.Much of his memoirs is told from a banking perspective and there are endless pages of statistical molasses. As a book, it often grinds to a halt. Is there a board on which Rockefeller hasn't served? It doesn't appear so. When the author speaks of his interests outside of the business world, i.e. art, New York, his family, etc. he does so in a way that is almost too carefully crafted and therefore, dispassionate. One gets the feeling of a man somewhat detached, perhaps reflecting that isolated childhood to which he refers.The best chapter in this book deals with his (often contentious) relationships with his brothers, especially Nelson. Being in a locked room as an observer at one of their summit meetings would have been a treat! I suspect that part of the motive of Rockefeller's writing this book was to cast himself in the best possible light vis-a-vis John, Laurence, Winthrop and Nelson. In the end, he presents his own portrait as the diplomat of the five, certainly the most reasoned and the one with coolest head.David Rockefeller, nonetheless, is an unusual man from many angles and his book is a rare and valuable insight into his famous family. Without sibling rebuttal, I'm just not sure how much of it to believe. His reflections, however, have made me hope that in the future a book can be written about all of the Rockefeller brothers from an outsider's point of view. This would give a more balanced view of the Rockefeller family.

I had no idea this movie be so much fun...it was terrific. It has sort of a "Beetlejuice" quality to it. The kids really make the film but the bright colors of the cinematography and the soaring music of Benjamin Britten's "Noye's Fludde" make this movie a standout!

As warm as the Italy he loves,William Murray has written an incredibly beautiful tribute to his mother, Natalia Danesi Murray and her long-time companion, Janet Flanner. He explores their deep relationship with great care, keeping the focus on them as he adds his own experiences growing up and growing older with them. What a triumvirate this must have been! Murray succeeds where many authors fail in noble attempts at &quot;family&quot; biography....he keeps just the right perspective in telling their story as well as his own. He relates the anguish of both women who experienced long separations from each other over their 38-year relationship but tempers it with the joy that Natalia and Janet felt during their many months, then finally years, together. I am impressed that Murray doesn't get carried away with general philosophizing about Lesbian working women, especially at a time when homosexuality was at its nadir...he rather simply, elegantly, and with several dashes of humor, becomes the camera lens through which we are able to view their personal and professional sides, especially through Janet's many letters to Natalia. In the end, I feel as if I have known all three for a long time.

Simon Winchester's new book, &quot;Krakatoa: The Day The World Exploded&quot;, more or less consists of three shorter books woven together by a gigantic stitch. For some readers this might be an enticement but for others I would suspect the opposite to be true.The first &quot;book&quot; is a mini-history of the Dutch involvement in present-day Indonesia several centuries ago with an emphasis on the Dutch East Asia Company. Winchester is good at giving a &quot;flavor&quot; of the times, and, while harsh on the Dutch, sets a nice tone for &quot;Krakatoa&quot;. The second &quot;book&quot; contains the reason I give the work four stars instead of five. If the reader bought &quot;Krakatoa&quot; purely for learning about its eruption and demise, then the third chapter of &quot;Krakatoa&quot; might be where one stops. It is an overlong technical class concerning tectonic plate movements and scientific theorists proven and debunked. I began to have second thoughts about continuing &quot;Krakatoa&quot; while reading this chapter. However, having gotten through it, the remaining parts of this book are very good. Winchester's narrative is especially effective in two places.....his actual description of what it would have been like to have been near Krakatoa (and indeed, WAS like for some who gave the few surviving accounts of August 27, 1883) and the recounting of his own visit to Anak Krakatoa (the island formed in Krakatoa's wake) not too long ago.I would recommend Winchester's book but with a caveat....be ready for &quot;Krakatoa's&quot; rises and falls...and by this I refer to the book and not the volcano, itself.

"Mysterious Skin", a story of the parallel lives of two boys from Hutchinson, Kansas, is riveting from the beginning. This perfectly-cast film stars the protagonists, Neil and Brian, played terrifically by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet, whose connected roots lie at the hands of their little league coach from years back... a man who sexually abused them both.The film follows both boys, particularly Neil, as he becomes a male prostitute and finds quick encounters without much effort. Neil eventually lands in New York, where his "partners" are available everywhere, and the sex is rougher and more demeaning. Brian, on the other hand, suffers his shame in relative silence. The final reunion of the two is both poignant and haunting.The real star of "Mysterious Skin" is Gordon-Levitt. He's come a long way from his "3rd Rock from the Sun" days and has developed into a persuasive and multi-talented actor. I hope we see more of him in the future. His performance in this film is riveting, and because of it, I highly recommend "Mysterious Skin". It's not always easy to watch but the depth of the storyline and acting is well worth it.

"Mulligans" an austere, tight look at gay relationships, will never be among those ground-breaking gay films, but after viewing it, the film has some merit. Granted, the acting is almost as bad as the premise, but for gay dads who find themselves coming out...well, there are plenty of them to take some notice. Written by Charlie David, the younger attraction, it shows a fair amount of promise but not much perspective. In the hands of a more seasoned writer, "Mulligans" could have had more promise.The film is worth a look. But again, viewed from the father's point of view...the one who carries the weight of family and all the love and baggage that accompanies him... I give credit to actor Dan Payne, who plays the dad. He gives a plausible, thoughtful performance. "Mulligans" is a film that blends an awkward past with some semblance of hope for those trapped in marriages that cannot endure.

Richard Engel's new book, &quot;A Fist in the Hornet's Nest&quot;, gives us a rare look into Iraq at the time of last year's American invasion. Nicely setting the tone of pre-war Iraq, Engel then takes us down the path of a city...Baghdad... in the sudden throes of war. Combining ingenuity, &quot;street smarts&quot; and a certain amount of luck, he gives us a view that no embedded correspondent could have done....a view that incorporates ordinary Iraqis going about their daily life with the inevitable hardships that they faced, and still do. The author is not shy about revealing his own thoughts regarding the American attack and occupation, but he does so in a way that offers perspectives based on what he saw, the people with whom he spoke and his general knowledge of the Middle East, having lived there prior to April, 2003.&quot;A Fist in the Hornet's Nest&quot; could be more rightly described as a journal although he doesn't proceed in an exact timeline format. Richard Engel's writing is crisp and articulate and moves forward with a sense of urgency. He has provided a valuable addition to the history of this war and an assessment of where it might go.

This could have been the next book of fiction in a line of novels written by master storyteller Stewart O'Nan, but the fact that &quot;The Circus Fire&quot; actually took place allows Mr. O'Nan to cross successfully into the world of non-fiction. He does so combining broad strokes with intimate detail. Like a circus juggler, Mr. O'Nan keeps several narratives going at once, centering much of the time on several groups of friends and families who met death and injury head-on when they attended the circus in Hartford, Connecticut on July 6, 1944.&quot;The Circus Fire&quot; is a very scary book. Mr. O'Nan has spared nothing in chronicalling the events of that summer afternoon. The fates of hundreds of people who tried to flee the big top were decided in many cases by good or bad decisions and luck, often escaping by a matter of inches. He accompanies his stories with several &quot;side shows&quot;....how people react in panic situations, how the ongoing war effort and preparedness affected the response by local and state officials, how the circus hierarchy was run, and so on.I would suggest that readers keep a finger in page 24; the &quot;principals&quot; page. One will need to refer back to this particular list of attendees throughout the book. Although Mr. O'Nan sees their stories through to the end, I wish he had included that same list with their outcomes on a single page at the end of the book as his summaries tend to diffuse.I am impressed by Mr. O'Nan's attention to detail and his observation of dozens of ironic twists. The story could have ended with the investigation wrap-up, but the ongoing search for the cause of the fire, the man who may have set it, and the identity of &quot;Little Miss 1565&quot; carries the book to the present. Just like fire itself, &quot;The Circus Fire&quot; envelops you. I hope readers will take time to read it carefully. It is a profound book.

As author Cherie Burns notes more than once in her wonderful new book, "The Great Hurricane: 1938", it's hard to believe that with all the advances in meteorology over the past half-century that there could still today have been a time in people's memories where they were taken by surprise by such a large and deadly hurricane. Yet, that's exactly what happened on September 21, 1938 when New England (and Long Island) bore the brunt of this storm.What struck me immediately was the fact that people didn't refer to such storms in New England as "hurricanes"...those were storms that hit Florida and the Caribbean. New Englanders were used to "nor'easters" and this one was referred to as the "big blow". The results, after only four hours of onslaught were, of course, devastating. Moving at an incredible sixty miles per hour, "GH38" (as the author calls it) made landfall on the eastern shore of Long Island, creating havoc there before it slammed into Connecticut. Rhode Island suffered the most damage, death and injury as GH38 wiped out most of the shoreline, including an entire small community, Napatree Point, before surging waters overwhelmed the city of Providence. More than seven hundred people died overall and the cost in terms of casualties and property loss would be counted for weeks.Ms. Burns has an eye for detail and a dramatic narrative style that lends itself well to a book about a natural disaster. She relates that the United States was recently emerging from the shadows of the Depression and gives us reminders not just of life in general, but of people's every day activities. It's her careful approach to this aspect which helps put down a foundation for her story. The bonding elements, though, are those people who actually lived through that awful day...the reader gets to know them as if they were our own next-door neighbors. Her compilation of the collective memories of those she writes about are stirring. Some managed to keep a sense of humor as their worlds were falling apart around them while others simply suffered terrible consequences from the wrath of the storm. The most famous survivor of GH38 was Connecticut's Katharine Hepburn, whose house in Fenwick floated one third of a mile downstream. But this book really belongs to another Catherine...Catherine Moore, whose Rhode Island house broke apart after her family and others had taken refuge in the attic. Just after the wind blew the roof off, they managed to make the attic floor a raft and away they sailed, ending up on Barn Island in Connecticut. Catherine's split-second decisions combined with a fair amount of luck, undoubtedly saved her family.As she nears the end of the book, Cherie Burns sums up the catastrophe in largely human terms. I laughed out loud when I read about the irony of a lumber mill operator in Brookline, Massachusetts. The farm lost two hundred trees and the author writes, "the owner set up a sawmill to salvage building lumber, and the rest was stacked in woodpiles to burn in stoves and fireplaces. The supply would last until 1980, when her grandson burned the last bundle". This warm, humorous anecdote helps to offset the tragedy of the great hurricane of 1938. Cherie Burns has put together a terrific book about a terrible day, and as I read it in one sitting, I highly recommend it.

Don Cheadle. The face of Rwanda in a film so overpowering one should see it twice but might only stomach it once. After a dozen years we Americans barely remember "Hutu" and "Tutsi" but are reminded that while we slept thousands upon thousands were slaughtered. "Where was the international outrage?", it so boldly asks.While the film industry comes under constant scrutiny for the choice and decisions of the films they make, "The Hotel Rwanda" serves as a haunting reminder of the genocide that went barely undetected. Where is Rwanda today? Nobody seems to ask, care or know. I urge viewers to see "The Hotel Rwanda". It is that good, and more.

It has taken me years to read "On the Road", but having just finished it, it was worth the wait. What a fantastic book. This is about Jack Kerouac, of course, but it's really a book about relationships. There are many people we encounter as the author takes us on a trip of a lifetime, but Neal Cassady emerges as his most beloved friend and that relationship turns out to be hauntingly close. Kerouac's narrative is so good and so powerful that the pages turn quickly and lovingly.Some have said that "On the Road" is timeless, and I add my voice to that effect. It is raw, wild and beautiful, much as I would have expected Kerouac, the man, to be. I highly recommend it.

This wonderful film could have simply been concerned with South American "justice" in the mid-1970s (in this case, Argentina) but it evolves into a film with significant depth and was made with obvious great care. It is brutal and warm, sinister and compassionate, probing and surprising.While the plot, in itself, is elementary, the film is carried on the shoulders of Ricardo Darin, whose sturdy face is perfect for the role as Benjamin Esp&oacute;sito, an investigator with a stake in solving a homicide from years back. Nicely paired with Soledad Villamil, (Irene) who plays his partner in anti-crime, the film gathers steam slowly yet never comes to a complete boil. It doesn't have to. What takes place in two hours is gripping....the viewer would not want to be interrupted during the course of it."The Secret in Their Eyes" is just that. It is a film of immense proportion, terrifically acted and destined to be remembered. I highly recommend it.

Geoffrey Nunberg's "Talking Right" is one of a number of books that have come out recently explaining why Democrats (and liberals, though not necessarily synonymous) have trouble getting their collective message across. Nunberg's approach is through language itself as he relates the success that the Republican right wing has had in wresting control of that message through slick phrases and twists on existing parlance. The author's book is straightforward and informative, to say the least.It's clear from the beginning of "Talking Right" that this is not a book that will scream either at the right wingers or at us, the readers. Slowly, but with a broad brush, Nunberg hits the right (and with it the left, as well) with chapters on class, the "L" word, government and values. He's terrific, for instance, in delving into the word "freedom" and how the earliest Americans didn't use that word much...they preferred "liberty". It may be a bit of a shock to learn that the Declaration of Independence doesn't mention freedom at all but we are reminded "...it was liberty that Patrick Henry declared himself willing to die for....". In this wonderful chapter, Nunberg goes on to explain how freedom then became connected with other words along the way and how it became central to the Republican party's campaign for word domination.While much of "Talking Right" is low-key, Nunberg revs up in a chapter called "Old Bottles, New Whines" and almost roars to the finish. The narrative here becomes eye-popping and this last third of the book is the best. Near the end of "Talking Right" Nunberg, speaking about "the right's capture of the basic vocabulary of politics...", concludes "...if the right can do this with an ersatz populism, surely the Democrats can do the same thing with a genuine one". It's a fitting statement to include in the final chapter of this terrific book.

Eric Klinenberg's new book "Heat Wave" gives readers a tremendous insight into the Chicago heat wave of 1995. He approaches this tragedy from several fronts. He begins with an account of what happened during the several days of stifling heat and continues with a look at the social impact of living and dying alone, why certain neighborhoods lost more people than others and exposes a city ill-prepared to handle the mounting number of deaths. Klinenberg continues with an assault on the politics of Chicago, the response of the mayor and those around him and finishes with an adept look at the media's role and response to the deaths of over 700 people.Although at times the author writes in a dry style he nonetheless portrays the Chicago heat wave as a catastrophic failure on many levels. Klinenberg gets down to the root of some socio-economic problems that beset Chicago and tells us the "whys" of their causes. Many things stood out as I read this important and often scary book, but one thing kept coming through....although heat waves are discriminating killers the solutions are there if right decisions are made at the right times, by governments and citizens alike.A sad and ironic end to "Heat Wave" is told in the form of a senior editor at The Chicago Tribune who decided to relate this tragedy from both a human and social side. As Chicago cooled down his work went on. Unfortunately, only a small part of the story was ever printed as the paper decided that in the chill of November few readers would be interested in a story that had occurred during the blistering heat only a few months before.I highly recommend this book. It is a service to help us understand what happened during July of that year. As the author points out, this could happen again.

If you haven't seen much of Andy Garcia's work (which I hadn't) "City Island" is a film for you. He is terrific as Vince Rizzo (a corrections officer, not a prison guard...please!) whose secret passion for acting coupled with a chance meeting with an inmate brings a cast of characters together that weren't necessarily out of central casting. The Rizzo family fights, makes up, fights again and all of this is made possible by Garcia and a first-rate supporting cast. The fact that Vince's teenage son has a passion for ultra fat New York women adds to the dysfunctional wonderment of the Rizzo family."City Island" was recommended to me by a friend and it turned out even more loveable than I had anticipated. I highly recommend this film for its true emotional delivery and terrific performances by its cast members.

This fascinating documentary takes the viewer through the building process of one grand piano, assembled at the Steinway factory in Astoria, Queens. From the main body of the piano through the final fine tuning process, we get to know every aspect of how a piano is built and the artisanship we get to see is astounding. Added to the technical aspects are interviews with such stars as jazz pianist Harry Connick, Jr. and classical pianist Lang Lang, who discuss what they like in a piano and how they would choose one. There are several side stories as well...the most poignant being the delivery of a Steinway to the home of a teenage boy who, when he begins to play, brings tears to the eyes of two older generations of his family."Note by Note" is as beautifully crafted a film as it reflects the craftsmanship it seeks to uncover. I highly recommend it.

After finishing James M. McPherson's recent book, &quot;Antietam: Crossroads of Freedom&quot;, I decided to dive into his earlier tome, &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot;. Both books are worthy of the highest recommendation. McPherson is a marvelous storyteller, in the best possible sense of that word. While not easy to condense the Civil War into one volume, the author has succeeded by pacing his book well and delving into the many contributing factors to and about the war, other than simply the battles themselves.McPherson has a very good sense of drama. After finishing &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; I began to think about why this book was so good. One of the reasons, I concluded, is that he is able to give us the history of the war as if the reader were at either end of a tug-of-war, because that seems to be precisely how the war was regarded on both sides. The pendulum of victory swung back and forth so many times during the four-year period as it raised the prospects of victory in both north and south only to plunge them into the abyss of despair with the next battle outcome. If one thinks about actual photographic images of the Civil War, one can only see black and white. But the author provides the color....both in battle and in periphery.Beginning with the Mexican War, McPherson lays the groundwork carefully and slowly. He is particularly adept at recounting the political aspects of this period, especially the impotency of U.S. presidents of the 1850s. By the time Fort Sumter is fired upon (almost one-third of the way through the book), the reader by now has a comprehensive look at the unfolding situation.Although he is distantly related to one of the Union generals, McPherson's sympathies seem to lie in two places...with the South, but particularly with Abraham Lincoln. In fact, it would be easy to read this book in Abraham Lincoln's mind and shoes. McPherson writes with a broad brush approach and his style matches how we might think Lincoln preceived things.....like a radar box constantly surveying the horizon.While the author's descriptions of the battles are certainly moving, he succeeds more in giving us the picture of what it was like in the non-combat arena. I particularly enjoyed his referrals to newspaper headlines and editorials....they were the chief news conduits of the day and the sway that they held over their readers was powerful.McPherson's summation is concise. It outlines the four turning points of the war. With a little different foresight, planning, numbers of men, materiel, rations and luck, the outcome of the war might have turned out differently. The author shows us how close each side came to breaking through and staying on top. What is amazing is that it took so long for one side to achieve victory.

Christopher Moore has produced a small but significant work with "In Other Words"....how certain words and phrases from other languages can't simply be translated (or not at all). Moore's book is at the same time charming and expansive in its scope.From Western European languages to those that are indigenous, the author has looked into just about every nook and cranny to find words that convey a certain feeling in their native tongue but not in others. One is struck by the number of languages that have multiple words that deal with love, emotions or inner peace. These examples are arresting when compared to English. Moore's humor is very much in evidence throughout and one line I laughed out loud about was this one, (referring to the Danes' description of their own speech) "det er inget sprak, det er en halsinfektion"- ("it's no language, it's a throat infection!") Another favorite was the Italian word, "attaccabottone" which refers to a bore who buttonholes you with "long tales of woe".The author also refers to words that have taken on meanings different from their original definition. Words like "macho" and "chaos" are two examples. He warns us also to be careful using certain words and phrases....in one tongue they might mean one thing...in another, quite something else."In Other Words" is a most enjoyable book and I urge readers who have an interest in languages (and the quirkiness that surrounds them) to pick up a copy. It's an easy read and one that is bound to enlighten and put a smile on your face.

Michael D'Antonio's new book, "Hershey", is a fascinating look at one of the more peculiar titans of industry in the early twentieth century. Milton Hershey, renowned for founding the company that bears his name, was as benevolent as he was dysfunctional. He could be unusually petty and cruel to staff employees while, at the same time, pouring money into developing a town committed to his company and an orphanage that he subsidized for much of his life.D'Antonio, no stranger to orphanages, (witness his excellent book "The State Boys Rebellion") captures the essence of Milton Hershey perfectly. His main contribution to understanding Hershey is his dispassionate telling of Hershey's life. He gives the reader a fair and nicely balanced look at the man whose name became synonymous with American chocolate.A rags to riches story is no more in evidence than in this biography. D'Antonio delves into the person of Hershey....the constant early business failures, the help of family members in keeping him going, his rather brief and ultimately heartbreaking marriage to Kitty and his loneliness at the end. The author also compares Hershey's successes to other moguls of his time...Rockefeller, Carnegie and Wrigley to name a few. One gets the impression that Hershey might have been in the upper echelon of a second tier of business leaders but of all of them, his name (and his town), are lasting vestiges of the legacy of Milton Hershey."Hershey", the book, is wonderfully readable and I highly recommend it. It's as richly smooth and satisfying as chocolate, itself.

I have just finished reading Peter Kramer's new book, "Against Depression", and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. There's much in it to ponder but it contains some conclusions that don't quite add up.Kramer, himself, admits to being depressed and the book has a cast about it which suggests the author's own melancholy. Is this book written from the outside by someone who is taking an objective look at depression while adding his personal history, or is it written by a therapist who bases the book from within? On that point I'm not certain. Kramer presents some thoughtful insights, researched thoroughly, it seems. He is at his best early on when he describes his own clients and his interactions with them. Clearly, he's been around the track and has seen a lot. He offers a wonderful chapter called "Art" toward the end of the book in which he speculates about the role and connection of art and depression with well-known artists....especially poets. His insights are often brilliantly detailed and he gives the reader much on which to dwell."Against Depression" begins to sag in the middle part of the book, when he gets into heavy medical models and how they might offer help to those who are depressed. The narrative, however, is dry, dull and lengthy. One would have been better served with Kramer as a college professor explaining these chapters over the course of a semester. The idea that depression is a disease is not a new one but Kramer often carelessly pounces on new medical findings as if we have "arrived". It is as if he has taken us from point "A" to point "C".I was startled by a couple of things Kramer said. He often refers to depressed patients in his book as "cured" while holding forth that depression is something that is long-lasting...if you have episodes one, two and three you will certainly have four, five and six. Alcoholism is also counted as a disease but I know of no alcoholism counselor who would classify his patient as cured or "recovered". "Recovering" is the key word. How would one ever know if a patient is cured from depression if the recidivism rate is so high? Kramer also admits to combining medication and psycotherapy "almost always" in the treatment of major depression. That pill-popping approach leads one to wonder if his book will be (or is being) promoted by drug companies.As an entity, "Against Depression" is worthy of a different look at depression. The book is well thought out but it lacks cohesion and direction. I'd recommend it but with a caveat.....for me his views are too quickly given away to current trends.

I've always found Robert Reich to be one of the calmer, more sensible contributors to the American political dialogue and in his new book, "Reason", he continues that discourse...and then some. This book is to be read...it has balance, wisdom...and teeth.To be sure, Mr. Reich is a partisan Democrat, and no one reading his book would come to any other conclusion. But he spares not the rod for his fellow Democrats and he accuses them of malfeasance with regard to how the Radcons have moved their agenda forward and have shaped public opinion. He's right. It's one thing to say that all politics are cyclical but the author encourages those of us who are of a like mind to do more to change things. His writing about the war on terrorism (page 49), for instance, tells exactly what the Bush administration has so awkwardly tried to explain in recent days. Good for him...and good for us.Robert Reich has made a strong case for the direction in which the United States must go. I applaud him for his courage, his ability to deliver convincing thoughts and the timeliness of his book. As one who has "endured" Washington D.C. and its highly charged political environment, Mr. Reich knows more than a thing or two about how the country works. I recommend "Reason" to all with an open mind.

Make no bones about it....A.A. Gill does not consider himself to be British even though he has lived amongst them all of his life. He's a Scot and from the beginning this difference as well as other nations' comparisons are wryly and often harshly drawn out. This is a wonder of a book and probably the first book I've read that isn't propelled by nouns and verbs. "The Angry Island" is all about adjectives, spiced up with a lot of invective. From page one, I couldn't put it down for a minute.The author covers a wide range of topics about which to consider the Brits...their history, humour, class, voice, sport, drink and so on. At almost every turn, Gill pummels away. There is a rogues gallery of portraits of English kings and queens, described by Gill in various ways of contempt. The narrative gets really juicy as he relates the British "soul" (or lack, thereof) and his ability to write memorable phrases is outstanding. When, for instance, he speaks of the quintessential British fondness for gardening, he asks why we don't ever see people in those gardens. (Gardens do, apparently, make great final resting places for the dead) A typical Gill comment is this one, regarding why Brits are always queueing up. He says, "the English queue because they have to. If they didn't, they'd kill each other". And in a terrific chapter about nostalgia, Gill reminds us that the word itself, didn't exist before 1900. It didn't have to. But then again, the Empire was about to fall apart, hence the current nostalgia. Everything was better in your parent's generation, of course, than it is today."The Angry Island" is not just one tirade after another. Gill compliments the British on their memorials, especially those commemorating the "Great War." And in a personal chapter, while reporting that the English love their drink to the point of besottedness, he reveals his own alcoholism. It's a poignant moment in an otherwise stormy book.The author does have a knack for the use of adjectives and they abound in "The Angry Island", making the read all the more enjoyable. But it's his ability to peel back the layers of this overly-composed nation to get at what is really either wrong or funny (or both!) about the seemingly most uptight people in the world. To this end, I highly recommend "The Angry Island". It may not make one understand the British any better, but then again, it just may.

Of the fifty or so books I've read this past year, Simon Winchester's &quot;The Meaning of Everything&quot; has been my favorite. Winchester essentially begins by giving the reader a solid platform regarding the origins of English vocabulary and then continues with one of the most incredible stories...the seventy-one year compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary.This could have been a rather dry display but Winchester's wit and warmth are evident everywhere. From Herbert Coleridge through Frank Furnivall to James Murray and the thousands of people who contributed to the OED, this is a story of dedication and sacrifice. How many times the project could have been scrapped only to be saved by fated interfacing and intervention. This may indeed have been the first worldwide project and one gets the picture of a giant ant colony moving about to service the queen.Just as important, the author colorfully depicts the late Victorian era (the 1880s and 1890s) and shows how that was directly connected in many cases to the work of the OED's editors and sub-editors. Through it all, through all the personal clashes, work slowdowns, doubts about the progress of the dictionary, the work went on. And on. The critical turning point was James Murray's refusal to abandon the principles of his efforts because it was felt on more than one occasion that the work was going along at a slower than necessary pace. Thanks largely to Murray, the OED is the defining (pardon the double entendre) dictionary of the English language.Winchester closes his wonderful book by comparing how much more easy the work is today than how it was one hundred years ago as the updates and revisions continue. He correctly points out that because of the expanding nature of English dictionaries become out of date as soon as they are printed. This may be a sobering thought to lexicographers (and their publishers!) but the loftier thought is the one of language expansion. I highly recommend this book not only for its remarkable content but for the style in which Simon Winchester has delivered it.

Grover Cleveland's reputation among the presidents has risen over the past few years and Henry Graff's contribution to the American Presidents' series is welcome, though it is not a not terribly revealing study. Cleveland was known for his integrity but hardly remembered as a risk taker of any length as he served twice in the presidency. His years in Washington were solid, if not overly productive.This series about the U.S. presidents is designed to give a brief overview of the subects covered. This is not the best book in that series, but it is informative in many ways. The author tends to have more of a bent for covering the election process and the style of life exhibited by President Cleveland. Indeed the three elections in which Cleveland ran for president were all fairly close and worth a look, but I would like to have seen more on Cleveland's legacy and how it affected future presidencies. Graff's "Grover Cleveland" is a pleasant read, however.

I rarely read books of fiction but because of the fact that so many of many friends had suggested this book I thought it would be a good idea to keep up with the current, hot summer reading. As a testament to the fine writing by Dan Brown, I read a good deal of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; by flashlight during the recent power blackout.&quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; introduces a large number of primary characters but the author makes them different enough from one another that following them is not difficult and the chapters are by and large very short so that the action never stops. But the book has a kind of Keystone Kops quality to it...the reader can't quite believe how inept some of the law enforcement authorities are and how multiple their mistakes are. And, remembering this is fiction, the entire story takes place in a day or two. The movie can't be far behind.I found that the end of the book was the weakest and most disappointing. Still, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is well worth the read and the pace will keep you turning pages as fast as the plot twists and thickens.

The best way to breeze into summer is to read &quot;Eats, Shoots and Leaves&quot; by the witty British author, Lynne Truss. The punctuation lessons that one loved to hate growing up have remarkably been given a fresh coat of paint here. Anyone who has ever seen a sign or read a phrase of bad punctuation that stiffens the back or turns the head will revel in the author's examples of misplaced commas, apostrophes, colons, and other marks of punctuation. (I prefer the Oxford comma; but then, again, I'm an American)The first half of &quot;Eats, Shoots and Leaves&quot; is full of terrific illustrations of how punctuation changes the meanings of sentences and phrases. One of my favorites is &quot;no dogs please&quot; and the page on which Ms. Truss describes the decimation of Roman soldiers and tells of a sign that reads &quot;Illiterates' Entrance&quot; made me laugh out loud; something I rarely do while reading.The more sober second half of the book is her effort to set down some guidelines for the use of various punctuation marks. The author is careful not to allow herself to be boxed in hard and fast by former usage. Like an up-to-date schoolmarm she is strict but kindly; one feels that a test for the reader might be unveiled at any moment.How one can write a book like this with such warmth while needling much of the way is a testament to Ms. Truss. I highly recommend &quot;Eats, Shoots and Leaves&quot;.

J. M. Coetzee's new book, "Slow Man" deserves much praise.... it is largely about maturity (or the lack thereof) concerning a main character, Paul Rayment, who has suffered the loss of a leg and Paul's guardian angel/agent provocateur, Elizabeth Costello, who takes over more than a little of his life. Yet it is nicely written and passionate in its own way.Perhaps Costello's emergence in "Slow Man" is meant for balance and drawing Paul out is no mean feat. But her advice and platitudes become wearing after a while. Could Paul have survived in this book without Elizabeth? I would have preferred to have seen it that way....how he might have stumbled more with his nurse, Marijana and his attraction to her. Elizabeth is like an unwanted guest at a party and in the end I wanted no more of her. If that's Coetzee's final point, he takes a long time to get there.However, on the plus side of "Slow Man"....and there are many pluses, the author keeps a good pace and reveals his characters with depth and understanding. "Slow Man" is worth the read but the reader may find it agonizingly depressing.

Mark Kurlansky has written a breezy (yet ultimately gloomy) little book, full of tidbits of knowledge about the cod. It's a fascinating subject, especially if you have ever lived in the parts of the world where cod has reigned supreme. And yes, the author not only tells us about the fish itself, but how nations have struggled over the centuries to protect their collective livelihoods, occasionally warring against each other as national pride and survival were at stake.Several months ago I read Mr. Kurlansky's book, &quot;Salt: A World History&quot;. This newer book is far better than &quot;Cod&quot; as it delves deeper into a comestible that REALLY changed the course of history. A problem that I have with both books is the author's writing style. It's very disjointed. He jumps from one geographic area of cod harvest to another and from one time period to another as well. There is no real weaving of a story line here....it's as if he wrote each chapter on a whim.However, I especially like the inclusion of recipes in this book. It gives a &quot;human&quot; side to the cod and allowing readers to view recipes from Europe and North America is a great way to end the book. If you have any desire to read &quot;Cod&quot;, I would suggest reading it first before going on to &quot;Salt&quot;.

The funny thing about Al Franken's new book, "The Truth" (with jokes) is that a sequel is desperately needed. Why? So many things have happened in (or should I say "to") the Bush White House since this book came out....i.e. hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Harriet Miers' debacle, the DeLay and Libby indictments... it practically begs the very funny Franken to write another book. Even Nipsey Russell, the comedian quoted in "The Truth" has died. Al, we need you again!This book may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it should be. Franken's book sails along like a sled over new snow. While the chapter about Social Security is a bit of a slog and by now, old news, Franken, nonetheless aims his unquivered arrows at the right wing and scores time after time. The one thing that hasn't changed much since the publication this summer of "The Truth", is Iraq. Approximately two hundred more U.S. soldiers have died since the book went to print, not to mention the untold number of (and who knows how many) Iraqi civilians who have perished. As the author points out, the truth, in the Bush White House is all relative...they fit the facts to suit their needs.What is most appealing about Al Franken, whether you read this book, listen to him on radio or hear him on tv is that he has backbone and lots of charisma. And he checks his facts. "The Truth" is well documented, well paced, informative and lots of fun to read.Al Franken has often said he would like to run for political office and I hope he does. Can you imagine Franken filibustering as a Senator? What fun that would be! I recommend "The Truth" (with jokes) because it contains large doses of each.

Robert Kurson's new book, "Shadow Divers" is a serious book about a sport that can have as deadly a consequence to its participants as it had to those about whom divers are investigating. Discovering a German World War II U-boat in an area thought not to contain any U-boats, several brave divers took it upon themsleves to see a dangerous mission through to its successful conclusion. The author has related the story from beginning to end in a compelling way."Shadow Divers" revolves primarily around two divers who initially didn't care much for one another but grew to be "teammates" as they set about identifying a U-boat off the waters of New Jersey. John Chatterton and Richie Kohler were both men who were dedicated to their lives as divers...so much so that they each had marriages that failed. What didn't fail was their focus and determination to find out which U-boat it was as their leads and hunches came and went a good deal of the time. Through it all they had to battle the rigors of diving at incredible depths, the pitfalls of exploring a wreck, the "elements", other divers and sometimes, even themselves. The courage that Chatterton and Kohler kept through the years is the biggest unifying force in the book.The author, however, has a narrative style that is uneven. When he writes well, he writes terrifically well. His second chapter, "Zero Viz", is a grand layout of what deep-shipwreck diving is all about. For those of us who know nothing about the sport, Kurson sets together his facts in a highly readable and gripping way. One knows after this chapter that this is going to be a good book. Yet, curiously, he often lapses into a more juvenile style of writing...short, clipped sentences...more like ones that Joe Friday would use. And his comments about "Seeker" captain Bill Nagle's drinking become labored and unnecessary.All in all, "Shadow Divers" is a book I would highly recommend. The story here is an unusual one, told with care and bravado. When daredevils perform heroic acts and bring history one level closer to readers, a good author can capture that with broad strokes of writing. Robert Kurson has done just that.

Ward Morehouse, III has written a nice little book about the history of the Plaza Hotel, one of New York's enduring landmarks. The author takes the reader through all aspects of the building of the hotel (the present one is the second Plaza which opened in 1907) and has some wonderful insights of his own about life at the Plaza....he lived there as a boy.While the book is informative and has many photos from the past, it could have been better put together. Why, for instance is a floor plan not included? This would have been most helpful as the reader tries to imagine where many of the significant entertainment rooms are in relation to the others....especially ones that are no longer there. It would have been good to have a this kind of reference. Mr. Moorhouse's book jumps around quite a bit, also. Who proofread &quot;Inside the Plaza&quot;? The number of spelling mistakes is appalling. &quot;Dessert&quot; is always spelled &quot;desert&quot;.The best chapter regards the recollections of longtime employees, of which there are many. Their remembrances really add much to the color of the Plaza and they help the book to its conclusion. &quot;Inside the Plaza&quot; is an easy read and enjoyable.

With two new important books recently published about Abraham Lincoln ("Team of Rivals" and "Lincoln's Melancholy") the question can be begged, "do we need any further books on Lincoln?" Not having yet read the former but having just finished the latter, I would say, "yes, without a doubt!" Joshua Wolf Shenk's "Lincoln's Melancholy" is an important one and he succeeds in turning Lincoln inside out.Early in "Lincoln's Melancholy" Shenk writes that this is not a psychobiography....one that begins "with a theory- usually some derivative of Freudian theory- and seek(s) to buttress it with evidence. This book takes the opposite approach". Presenting Lincoln's life in a "facts first" way, Shenk is able to connect the dots from his subject's life events to their adjoining emotions. In doing so, he sets up a terrific read.Shenk divides Lincoln's life into three stages. In the first, (his late twenties and thirties) Lincoln showed signs of severe depression and his reaction was to become morose, withdrawn and to give up hope. Suicide was on Lincoln's mind in this first stage and all seems to have been lost to him. Whether or not Ann Rutledge's death proved to be a central theme in this early depression will remain a source of battle among historians for years (although Shenk seems to dismiss the love affair of casting any significant attachment to Lincoln's melancholy of this time). Stage two was marked by Lincoln's self-application to his work and success. At this point we see Lincoln becoming much more self-assured and probably more content. During this part of his life Lincoln is elected to Congress and begins to conceptualize a broader view of the world....particularly defining his views on slavery. The author seesaws between the historical narrative and what Lincoln might have felt. As with Lincoln himself, it is here that the book really begins to take shape. The third stage is Lincoln's awareness that he might be living for a greater and nobler cause. His presidency certainly allowed for this stage to be set but it is here, also, that Lincoln's most torturous days are revealed...marked most notably by the death of his son Willie, in 1862, and the continuing strains of war.The most intriguing part of "Lincoln's Melancholy" is saved for the end. In the afterword, Shenk comments on the post-mortem world of Lincoln, especially through the eyes (and the pen) of Lincoln's former law partner, William Herndon. The ensuing years brought countless historical judgments against Herndon's collected oral histories but Shenk believes that Herndon's time for resurrection has come.Joshua Shenk has taken a new, encompassing look at the inner life of our sixteenth president. He has done so in a manner that makes this book an engrossing read. Shenk is careful not to conclude too much but rather to offer insights into Lincoln's life. I highly recommend "Lincoln's Melancholy" for its depth of research and its engaging narrative style.

Stephan Knupfer, the slightly crazed star of this wonderful ninety-minute film, has a job that is both highly demanding and one that also demands a fair amount of tact. Knupfer, working out of Vienna, has an energy that is more than boundless as he dashes around keeping pianos tuned and egos in check. One doesn't need a background in piano (or for that matter, music) to enjoy "Pianomania", but a certain knowledge is helpful in understanding some of the inner workings of his professional world. I highly recommend this terrific and entertaining film.

In the days when tv emcees were over-emotive, phony-sounding or even grumpy, Peter Marshall always came across as one of the &quot;regular, nice&quot; ones. His book, &quot;Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square&quot; is chock full of the show's anecdotes and the stories of what happened not only on the set but behind it, too. I read it from cover to cover without even thinking of putting it down for a second.Marshall, who was host of the show for seventeen years, spares no one. He tells of the stars he liked and disliked. It's hard to read that the favorite star of many fans, Paul Lynde, was difficult, hard to please and drank so much of the time. But Marshall has kind words for Paul Lynde as he does for so many of those with whom he worked. I was particularly interested to find out how the stars &quot;developed&quot; their answers so quickly and so comically. That revleation was worth the whole book.And Marshall delves into the inner workings of how the show came about, its producers and all those who made the show such a success. The book is written in a breezy style and it keeps the reader interested at every level. The icing on the cake is the CD which is included. Forty-five minutes of &quot;outtakes&quot; from the show are recorded and had me in hysterics the whole time.Thank you, Peter Marshall, for helping us to remember what a great show &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; was. I'm glad you're still having fun with it all these years later!

Noam Chomsky's "Failed States" reflects the thinking of so many Americans these days....the United States is in trouble and we know it. With a sternly worded narrative, Chomsky delivers a message that is straightforward and well documented. Given the current crisis in the Middle East and the residual problems on the domestic front, "Failed States" could not be more timely. It is without doubt the best book of the year.Covering a period largely from the end of the Second World War to present, Chomsky begins with an assessment of what makes a "failed state". Among other things he declares that a failed state is one that has an "inability or unwillingness to protect (its) citizens from violence or perhaps even destruction". That statement alone is enough to question the Bush administration's so-called "war on terror" which, as the author concludes, has only caused more terror. Violence begets violence, as he rightly says. Chomsky's second characteristic of a failed state is one that is impervious to international law. Certainly in the past five years, to say the least, the United States has arrogantly sought to circumvent these laws and it leads to his third point...a sense by some Americans to think that we, as a nation, somehow own the moral high ground and should "spread our message" around the world. "Pshaw" says Chomsky and I couldn't agree more. The inherent dangers of this kind of thinking are evident in our decreased international standing and our increasing divisions here at home. For those Pollyannas who think that America's best days are ahead of us, "Failed States" will sober them up fast.Written in a detached and unemotional manner, Chomsky zeroes in on other failed states of the past and the present. The usual suspects abound....Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, Japan, etc., but he targets the present day US allies with equal force. The UK and Israel are tops on the list and if there ever was a time that the relevance of his arguments have borne fruit, look at today's Lebanon. While Chomsky's book (in this area) is related more to Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, had he been writing at this moment, the Israeli incursions into Lebanon no doubt would have been added.The term "historical memory" is as apt as any in the book and it is always a wonder (though not really) why failed states tend to repeat the mistakes of their past. Though no student of history, Bush II might have looked to others for advice before plowing ahead into Iraq, but uncurious as he is and surrounded by people who don't give a damn, it's no wonder the United States is in such a mess. The emperor has no clothes and is missing a few other things as well.Chomsky is at his best when he offers up the first of two chapters on democracy...."Democracy Promotion Abroad". The notion that the United States would somehow spread democracy to the Middle East has to be one of the most laughable ideas ever presented in a serious vein. Yet there was the president trying to sell it after the supposed WMDs weren't found. Funny we don't hear too much of that anymore. The author's finest hour comes with his chapter about "Democracy Promotion At Home". Here he brings the internal combustion of the current United States into the forefront. His assessments that business has never been more closely associated with politics than it is today and that the country's wishes are the exact OPPOSITE of public policy couldn't ring truer. When the United States fails in the end it will have collapsed from within as Chomsky might very well agree."Failed States" contains so much about which to think that it should be absorbed with great care. It is a tour de force...a book that reaches not so stunning conclusions by revealing the very facts that have needed assemblage under one cover. I thank Noam Chomsky for his wonderful landmark contribution.

Joseph Lelyveld's "Omaha Blues", a recollection of his growing up years, is a book that touches all emotions. Having only known the author through books like Seth Mnookin's "Hard News" and his (Lelyveld's) appearances on programs such as Charlie Rose, I felt a certain draw to read "Omaha Blues". I was not disappointed.Had the term "dysfunctional" been around in the 1940s and 1950s, Lelyveld's family could be described as such. Uprooted every few months it seems, Lelyveld spent much of his childhood with different family members (other than his parents) and with total strangers (the Jensen family in Nebraska). One wonders how this nomadic life can affect the maturity of any child, but he seems, somehow, to have taken much of this in stride. It certainly gave him a foundation for his own independence, to which he alludes.A large section of the middle of the book is devoted to his boyhood "friend", Ben Goldstein, (aka Ben Lowell, aka George B. Stern) who seems to have served as the author's mentor or avuncular presence. While Lelyveld and Goldstein appeared to have known each other for only a brief few years, the older man certainly played an enormous role in the life of the budding foreign correspondent. That so much of this relationship is left to the imagination of the reader, Lelyveld nonetheless fills in the pieces of how Goldstein was connected to his own family...that story, in itself, is worth the read of "Omaha Blues".I appreciate the author's candor regarding his own recollections of these formative years. While he was nicknamed "the memory boy", Lelyveld is not above letting us know that his own memory is sometimes very faulty. This admission adds to the charm of the book and allows him to be as human as possible."Omaha Blues" is told straight from the author's heart. I highly recommend it to any reader who wishes to explore the depths of his or her own family relationships. Joseph Lelyveld has given us his remembrances in a most affective way.

David McCullough, the foremost historical writer of our times, has written an exceptionally moving account of the Revolutionary War in 1776. It is by no means a comprehensive look at all military and political aspects of that year, but it doesn't need to be.....McCullough has put together a masterful, detailed and moving book.Laying the background with his description of England's King George III, McCullough then shifts the focus to the British siege of Boston and George Washington's successful liberation of the city. One can envision the angst of the Continental army as told by the author. Poorly outfitted and often cold and hungry it is a wonder that the British were ever defeated. But as McCullough points out, luck was often on the Americans' side. Whether it be a turn in the weather or the British commanders' unwillingness to attack, Washington took advantage of every opportunity. Perhaps the most amazing feat during the war was the surprise (and victorious) attack on the Hessians at Trenton.For those of us who have read other books by David McCullough, "1776" stands right up there with his finest works. The chapters are told with crispness, clarity and a clear sense of forward movement. I heartily recommend "1776".

This disc, one of several in "The English Anthem" series, is of notable achievement. It is also unique for the diverse nature of the selections. There are standards such as Walton's "Set Me as a Seal" and the romantically dramatic "Expectans expectavi" of Charles Wood. A new anthem to me was the unusually precocious offering by Thomas Attwood, "Come, Holy Ghost", sounding much more mature than the times in which it was written. Yet, new pieces such as Robert Saxton's "At the round earth's imagined corners" reminded me that English choral composition is still wonderfully alive and beautiful.The singing throughout is very good, although, as with many British choirs, the boy sopranos can often overwhelm. That said, this album is a treat for the ears and a lasting one for all to enjoy.

A surprisingly enchanting film, "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is one of the "sleeper" comedies of 2008.....no pun intended. It has heart, charm and a bundle of sympathetic characters. In short, it's a very good film.Credit must go mostly to writer/star Jason Segel, who weaves a tale of broken dreams and second chances... where love and loyalties change faster than a Hawaiian sunset. Two supporting actors deserve special mention...Mila Kunis, whose direct and passionate involvement with Peter (Segel) is a real hit. But my favorite of the film is Russell Brand, the valium-infused British number two boyfriend of Sarah's. He steals almost every scene he's in. The one disappointment is Paul Rudd, whose character never has much chance to develop. It's too bad, as his talents are underused here."Forgetting Sarah Marshall" is light enough to keep you involved and just deep enough to hold your curiosity. I recommend it for its well-told story and its "down to earth" fun.

Al Franken has done it. He has has written a book that hits the right with force and he does it in a provocative and humorous way. He takes on everyone and spares no one. Saddam should have had such a scorched earth policy. Fantastic!From Bill O'Reilly through Sean Hannity to a wonderful look at poor Barbara Bush, (well, not poor in the sense that she grew up in Rye, New York) Franken delivers the goods. The religious right also gets the shaft and FOX News...well...read the book.This is the first foray about the left hitting back. And hitting back hard. It is timely and appropriate. Al Franken should get an award for his candor, wit and truth. Having grown up in a town that raised the senior Bush and living within ten miles of the Coulter-bred, Barbara-fed crowd, many of us just laugh. &quot;We used to be Republicans&quot;, one older friend said to me. No longer. Thanks, Dubya. And thank you, Al. A great book.

As a Justice of the Peace who has performed dozens of gay weddings I was looking forward to seeing this when I first heard about it. What a wonderful film it is. Two people caring for each other for over forty years is a marvel. The intimacy they allowed us to see was beautiful and the culmination of the film...their marriage in Canada.... was the icing on the cake. I highly recommend "Edie and Thea".

As compiled by Robert Wyatt and John Andrew Johnson, George Gershwin springs to life in this book as much as his music. Told from the inside out, the authors allow Gershwin, his contemporaries and those who followed him to create a picture of the composer and how he lived and breathed music every day. This is a beautiful book.Chief among the contributions in "The George Gershwin Reader" are letters between Gershwin and those with whom he came into contact. We read Gershwin's letters describing how he composed, reactions from him to those who challenged his compositions (especially questions about his own orchestrations) and his eternal boyishness as he wrote friends and family regarding his daily pleasures. His early demise only strengthened the views of so many that Gershwin was a musical genius and that he, more than any other composer, captured the essence of America in transition between the two world wars.Although "The George Gershwin Reader" can occasionally get overly detailed in musical theory, the pages flow easily. The brief summaries that the authors give before each numbered entry are most helpful for explanation in setting the stage for what ensues. The timeliness of Gershwin's life mirrored by these entries is the authors' best contribution.It is easy to see why, more than eighty years after George Gershwin's first big success, "Rhapsody in Blue", his music has so long endured and is so endeared. This book is a great tribute to Gershwin and one I hope other readers will enjoy thoroughly.

The Columbian Exposition of 1893 was certainly the progenitor of fairs that followed in the United States. Attempting to re-create that comes along "Expo", designed to give the viewer a comprehensive look at that fair. To a degree, it succeeds."Expo" outlines the history of the fair in detail and Gene Wilder's narrative is sufficient, if not overly compelling. The DVD takes way too much time to tell its story, evidenced by the cheesy updates in artists' renderings and suggestion. (If I saw one more belly dancer appear in this offering, I was ready to hit the "stop" button on my remote) Given the fact that this was a great historic event... and the documentary does many things well....why resort to cheap new age stuff when the history, itself, would suffice? Ken Burns knew how to do it in his "Civil War" series....these guys did not.If the viewer can remove the lesser, innocuous bits of "Expo", it's worth a look. But I wonder how much better this story could have been told, with the right temperature and persuasion. Clearly, Chicago in 1893 had a great more to be written about and viewed upon and I hope the next rendition of this fair can be told within a better reference.

It probably takes a person who has had an abusive childhood such as Buck Brannaman had, to do what he has done with his life, so it was a great joy to view this exceptional documentary on understanding horses. Watching Buck work with horses and to get them to understand him is a true piece of art. He's calm, rational and affects warm relationships with the animals he gets to know.Interviews with Robert Redford (who used Buck in "The Horse Whisperer") and conversations with Buck's wife, daughter, stepmother and friends make this a convincing ninety minutes of education and inspiration. I highly recommend it.

The notion that one lonely month in our nation's history could have been so pivotal is an enticing one and Jay Winik has written a wonderful book to support this idea, full of rich detail and color. Mr. Winik at heart is a great storyteller (and I mean that sincerely). His narrative, while certainly not always straightforward in a timeline sense, offers the reader a chance to glimpse the end of the Civil War and the presidential assassination through the eyes of two men in particular, Robert E. Lee and Abraham Lincoln. He weighs in on the sides of these two as the chief decision-making opponents in the last days of the war.I felt as if I were on the battlefields. That's the mark of a great author. He draws you in to the fray, not as a viewer but as a full-fledged participant. His pages regarding the meeting of Lee and Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House and the hours that led up to them are riveting.His premise that the war might well have gone on in guerilla fashion had not Lee made his decsion to surrender is new to me. We certainly never were taught that angle in school. Even the best raconteurs know how to bend a thought and overlap a fact or two. Still, I would highly recommend it. Mr. Winik deserves praise for bringing the events of April, 1865 into focus and his style in realting these effects is superb.

In a mere eighty-four pages, the late William Styron relates with incredible depth his own journey through depression and the causes of it. Among the most profound elements that Styron mentions is that depression is a disease of loss and at least this reader was impressed by the author's boldness in being able to tell of the months he endured his own trauma followed by an ultimate recovery."Darkness Visible" is a book largely about hope. As he points out, most people experiencing depression, even in its darkest forms, do survive to live another day. He acknowledges that much is still to be learned about why certain people are prone to depression and what more can be done to help those suffering from it. The remarkable service that William Styron has given us with regard to this disease is heartfelt. I highly recommend this book for its honesty and insight.

"Into the Wild", based on a true story, is a fine film with some fundamental flaws. Christopher Johnson McCandless, leaves a comfortable environment to live on his own and to seek his own destiny. He wanders through South Dakota, Arizona and California before eventually finding Alaska, where everything changes.Sean Penn's film is often heart-wrenching but it dwells too much on platitudes. Added to that, Christopher seems unusually too well-equipped for the realties of the harsh life portrayed. He gets into some scrapes, mischief and trouble but often comes out looking better than he has any right to do. That said, "Into the Wild" is worth viewing for one main reason...the gratifying performance of Emile Hirsch. This young actor is terrific and keeps the viewer's eye on him all the time. I can't think of another actor who is better suited for this role and I recommend "Into the Wild" for this performance alone.

Using definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary and quotations from several sources, Harry G. Frankfurt, Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Princeton University, has concocted a small book about bs and what it means to us. Retirement for all of us should be this good.When I was growing up BSA meant "Boy Scouts of America". It now more accurately represents "bs artist". How far have we come in the proliferation of bs? Frankfurt tells us. This book is not so much about the definition of the word or term but the parsing of them. Frankfurt makes a distinct difference, however, between lying and bs-ing. Hence, Al Franken's book, "Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them", could never be subtitled, "Humbug, and the Faking Bs-ers Who Relate Them". One wishes the author had used Bill Clinton's contribution of "it depends on what your definition of 'is' is". With that quotation Frankfurt would have greatly extended his humorous offering.If it's possible for such a short book to get better, this one actually does. I recommend this quick read.

"The Queer Composition of America's Sound", a new contribution by Nadine Hubbs, tackles a subject which is as fascinating in concept as it is mystifying in content. How is it that the premiere American composers of the twentieth century happened to be identified as gay and to what end has that influenced their compositions?Centering around Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson, whom Hubbs refers to as essentially the "father and mother" of American composers, the author (adding several more composers to "the circle") seeks to build a case around the conception that their individual and perhaps collective sexuality contributed to what we might say is the defining American sound. Rounding out the junior colleagues of Copland and Thomson, (Marc Blitzstein, David Diamond, Leonard Bernstein, Paul Bowles and Ned Rorem) Hubbs refers to them as "gay modernists", whose works are more tonal than not, and more simple in their overall construction....therefore, more effeminate and ultimately homosexual. As a balance, the author cites the twelve-tone Sch&ouml;nberg-esque composers as more atonal and more masculine.Covering roughly the period between 1925 and 1955, an early point made in the book is that before Copland came along there was no such thing as an "American sound" and save for a revival of Copland's music after the American bicentennial, the American classical sound has all but disappeared. How ironic, she points out, that the quintessential voice of American music came from a marginalized segment of the population, albeit a more accepted segment of the music profession.What's lacking in "The Queer Voice of America's Sound" is the connection of the composers' lives to their actual compositions. Would one consider "Rodeo" to be "gay"? If so, why? What in the musical structure of the piece would make it sound so? Hubbs offers a little of that in her chapter about Thomson's "Four Saints in Three Acts" but never quite connects the dots elsewhere. One can better imagine taking a class with her and having her play musical examples to back up her theses.The book has a dissertation-delivered feel to it rather than a narrative flow. It tends to hop around from one idea to another without a joining coalescence. Yet Hubbs has managed to give us a well-documented look into the lives of several mid-twentieth century American composers and proffer some perceptions as to how homosexuality contributed to the identity of American music and the men who figured in it.

Can you imagine researching this book? How many viewing hours must it have taken James Wolcott to listen to the dozens of "Attack Poodles" about which he writes? I, for one, am glad he did as he has written a first-rate, alarmingly funny book about those right-wing pundits that fan out across our airwaves.With the ongoing speed of a locomotive, Wolcott chops up people like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Peggy Noonan, Dennis Miller and a "host" of others. His comments on Coulter would make the blonde bimbo's hair curl more than it would on a hot, humid day. And he allows us to see through these hapless purveyors of nonsense like a clear pane of Zell-ophane.While the subect matter is one that should concern us all, the best part about "Attack Poodles" is that it is so deftly written. It leaves the reader trying to decide which poodle is the dumbest, (my vote goes to Joe Scarborough), the smarmiest (aren't they all), the biggest bag of wind (how about Robert Novak?) and so on. It's like being a kid in a candy shop with so many options from which to choose.I found myself nodding in agreement with his final conclusions, which are pointed and welcome. It's a serious ending to a book which sticks the knife in, pulls it out cleanly and has fun along the way. When you have finished the book, just for added kicks, re-read the paragraph about Reagan's foot!

For those of us old enough to remember the summer of 1974 when the House Judiciary Committee voted articles of impeachment which ultimately led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, Barry Werth's new book, "31 Days" is a wonderful chronicle of that time. Although the book begins with the Nixon resignation (after the House vote) and ends essentially with Gerald Ford's pardon of Nixon, Werth presents a fascinating view of 1974....not only regarding the political scene but related areas which affected President Ford during his first month in office.Needless to say, Ford entered the presidency as no one before him had. He needed to make decisions about the soaring inflation the United States was facing as well as growing unemployment on the homefront. In international policy Ford had to address not only the beleaguered American presence in Vietnam, the continuing problems in the Middle East but also a coup and subsequent Turkish invasion of Cyprus. On top of that Ford needed to find a vice-president.... to replace himself. However, the largest piece of the picture was what would Ford do with Nixon? "31 Days" centers around this aspect and it's a fascinating walk down memory lane.How it was that Gerald Ford decided how and when to pardon the disgraced former president makes "31 Days" riveting. No one had a clue that Ford would use his power of pardon and Werth accurately describes the aftermath of that early September announcement. The honeymoon Ford enjoyed was over in a flash. Yet it is also a good connection that the author makes about how Ford might have decided things with regard to Nixon....he was contemplating a concurrent, limited amnesty for Vietnam draft dodgers and as he wanted them to "work their way back" into American society, so, too, had Ford wished to get a deeper sense of "mea culpa" from Nixon....something he really never got. As Werth points out, Ford's own relationship with his natural father and his peacemaking abilities he demonstrated between his father and mother almost certainly played a role in Ford's pardon. He simply wanted to do what was right for the good of the country and move on with life. However, as Werth points out in his epilogue, Ford's actions made things worse....it cost the Republicans massively in the midterm elections that fall and without a doubt contributed to Ford's narrow loss to Jimmy Carter in 1976.There are one or two things which reminded me of how long ago 1974 seems, sometimes. One cannot even fathom today a Republican president choosing a moderate to liberal Republican like Nelson Rockefeller as his vice-president. To think as well that Democrats controlled the Congress in large numbers...many of their ranks coming from southern states. Werth makes some good parallels to the current administration, noting that Don Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney were instrumental characters during the Ford years. And as if the author weren't prescient enough.... how alike the Bush White House is to Nixon's......two secretive administrations dealing with unpopular wars."31 Days" is a book I highly recommend....not only for the revelations of the behind-the-scenes White House activities of August, 1974, but the analogies to the current political climate in Washington today....analogies which seem to unfold on a weekly basis. Werth's book is a good lesson in history.

The American Presidents' series has offered many a good mini-biography of most of our presidents. I've read a number of them but this one about James K. Polk by John Siegenthaler, is one of the more curious. A good political romp it is, but much is left out.Polk, underrated or even unknown by most Americans, had an agenda upon taking office and was largely successful by its conclusion. His acquisition of the Oregon Territory, California and geographic spoils from the Mexican War have been known to Americans (from history classes)for years and Siegenthaler takes time to explore and explain how and why these were important to the United States and how President Polk, often singlehandedly, had to win over friends and foes to his side. Polk left the United States a much larger country when his term was over and he deserves much of the credit.What makes Siegenthaler's look at Polk fascinating is the number of presidents, past and future, whom Polk knew. John Quincy Adams, whose presidency came from political "fixing" loomed large early on in Polk's life. Andrew Jackson, the one closest to Polk and his political mentor, figures much in this book, as he should. Martin Van Buren, a rival for many years, is prominent in Polk's life and even the hapless John Tyler, who fancied a full term on his own, garners Polk's attention. Polk had no use for the hero of the Mexican War, Zachary Taylor, whose political ambitions got in the way of his military successes, in the eyes of our eleventh president. Even Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had connections with the Polk presidency and lastly, Harry Truman weighed in on Polk one hundred years later, commending him as a near-great president.What this book lacks is much of the personal Polk. It was understood that he was humorless and rigid, but beyond that Polk never seems to come to life in this volume, nor does his wife, the vivacious Sarah Childress Polk. It's too bad, because it would have given us a better balance to a president who, while not necessarily misunderstood, is nonetheless reduced because of personality peculiarities. Siegenthaler's attempts at discerning President Polk are noble, but fall short of the mark.

Based on Alan Hollinghurst's novel of the same name, "The Line of Beauty" follows the life of a young Englishman for four years in the mid-1980s as he emerges from his own closet and gets introduced to the harsh world of AIDS. This is a three-hour long miniseries and it is a gem.With the improbable name of Nick Guest, the main character moves in with a college friend's family and he is immediately adopted as one of their own. Played by the beguiling Dan Stevens, Nick is an innocent in a surrounding realm of politics and personal intrigue. The episodes play out nicely unto themselves. The first deals with Nick's new life in London and his first gay encounter.The second explores the richness of his own maturity as he meets the son of a wealthy Lebanese tycoon with the two young lads attempting to start up a magazine. The final episode exposes the grim details of the AIDS crisis, full-blown by 1987.Rarely does a deep and movingly successful book translate to the screen but this one does in droves. Each character is well-defined and deftly portrayed but Dan Stevens shines as he is true to his Nick Guest character and gives a terrific performance. I highly recommend "The Line of Beauty".

Over the years the occupier of the cellar of American presidents has changed. When I was growing up, Warren G. Harding held the title as "Worst President Ever", then Ulysses S. Grant seemed to vie for a tie. In more recent years and given a more thorough look, James Buchanan now resides there and Jean H. Baker's excellent short biography of President Buchanan goes into some reasons why that has happened.Far from being the domestic American Neville Chamberlain of his day, Baker argues that vacillation wasn't Buchanan's worst trait (although it was a pretty bad one) but his pro-Southern views were. As a seasoned politician and diplomat, our fifteenth president was arguably one of the best prepared to take over the presidency in 1857. But, as suggested, things began to heat up fast and Buchanan's support of the Dred Scott Decision, perhaps the worst Supreme Court decision in U.S. history, got the ball rolling. Buchanan seemed to be feckless at every turn, managing to alienate his own party politicians with decisions that pleased no one in the end. But her chapter on the lame-duck months of Buchanan's presidency is the best of the book, as it should be. This four-month transition is one of the most important in presidential turnovers and has been heavily scrutinized for decades with the author coming down hard on Buchanan. What might have been done to save the country had Buchanan actually moved swiftly and successfully to reinforce Fort Sumter, for instance? We'll never know, but Baker gives the reader some things about which to think.On the personal side, the author delves lightly into Buchanan's possible homosexuality and concludes, like everyone else, we'll never know. But she does make an interesting point toward the end of the book when she contemplates the reasons for Buchanan's pro-Southern tilt by suggesting that the president preferred the more genteel southern ways to the edginess of his northern counterparts.The American Presidents series is terrific and I've read several of the presidential mini-biographies. This is one of the best and I highly recommend it.

Scott Berg has written a zephyr-filled remembrance of one of America's cherished leading ladies. His twenty-year association with Katharine Hepburn was clearly a joy to both author and subject and his anecdotes are wonderful. Much has been said about Berg's self-infusion in this book but I found it to be not at all distracting. He passes on the warmth and quirkiness of Miss Hepburn with a good deal of affection.After finishing &quot;Kate Remembered&quot; I felt a desire to rent out some of her films. This is a nice way to continue the tribute to her. Scott Berg has helped preserve her memory and added to our understanding of this wonderful woman. I highly recommend it.

I enjoyed reading about the life of George Dawson, a man whose life has spanned three centuries. However, the mere fact that he has lived so long does not necessarily a feature book make. Aside from Mr. Dawson's rail travels and working on the Mississippi, Mr. Dawson had not done much else until he took up reading at 98. He can't comment much on events of the 20th century because he couldn't read, and what he could remember was scant. The reader is presented with a view of a genuinely kind man whose outlook on life is basically positive and warm. Yet, I often could not distinguish if I was listening to Mr. Dawson, or his &quot;co-author&quot;, Richard Glaubman. It would have been far more interesting to detail Mr. Dawson's years since he began to read. The book speaks of the large numbers of letters written to Mr. Dawson, congratulating him on his beginning his literacy venture so late in life. Why not write more about his classroom experience and how that must have transformed him recently?... or the interaction with those who now wish him well? Perhaps a second book should be in order because that is where the REAL interest in Mr. Dawson lies.

My, oh, my...they don't write 'em like this anymore! Well, maybe they do and &quot;The Alto Wore Tweed&quot; should be on every musician's reading list this summer. In fact, anyone who is into whodunits will love this book about a guy who writes a book with no plot, except it has one, as does the main book. Or something like that. (There's even a cemetery plot, too!) All I can say is the butler didn't do it. Heck, &quot;The Alto Wore Tweed&quot; takes more turns than an O.J. Simpson car chase. The surprise is that it is June and I suddenly have a hankering for Hugo Distler's &quot;The Christmas Story&quot;. Mark Schweizer, that's the mark of a good book....a bookmark, you might say.

Mark Schweizer has to win an award someday. I don't what the award might be except he has left me in stitches again. &quot;The Baritone Wore Chiffon&quot; is an even more enraptured, wonderful take on his first book, &quot;The Alto Wore Tweed&quot;. How he can make innocent fun of a character with leprosy might have you slapping your leg with laughter...except that the character might not have a leg. I only wish the author could somehow engage George Bush in his next book....I'd buy it in a minute!!

"The Tenor Wore Tapshoes" is my third foray into the world of Mark Schweizer and again he creates a wacky, if not wild world of Hayden Konig and Hayden's double life (well, triple life if you count his being the police chief, church organist and mystery writer) in St. Germaine, North Carolina. As with his previous books, the author intersperses his protagonist's daily doings with the formulation of a new mystery book. The stories don't go hand-in-hand, but Schweizer's humor is fetching and wonderfully presented.It helps to have a background in church music, as I do, to enjoy the fun more readily, as in the case of a certain hymn that is the seed of the town's mystery in this narrative. And yes, it is one of the worst hymns ever written! But even if the reader's background doesn't include music, "The Tenor Wore Tapshoes" is pure delight and I look forward to reading his new offering, "The Diva Wore Diamonds".

John T. Edge's new book, "Hamburgers and Fries" is an earnest and breezy look at America's signature food. Who would know how diverse a nation we are when it comes to the concoction of the simple burger. Edge tells us all about it.After a brief history of the hamburger, the author sets off in search of some of the tastiest and unusual burgers that can be found. From places as diverse as Mississippi and Connecticut, Edge discovers the local fare and is good enough to include the recipes in his book. (I'm from Connecticut and have never heard of a steamed cheeseburger.....I'll have to try one!)Edge describes areas of the United States as having burger "microclimates". In San Antonio, for instance, it is not unheard of to have a burger that melds refried beans, Cheez Wiz and Fritos corn chips...the chips being found just under the bun. I suppose one hasn't lived until he or she has tried the Hawaiian "loco moco", though when in Hilo I think I might opt for the "local burger". But peanut butter on a hamburger?? In Cleveland and Missouri it happens. Taste is more individual than I thought.I was disappointed that, despite its title, "Hamburgers and Fries" leaves the fries part mostly untouched. A scant fifteen pages is given over to the usual hamburger accompaniment. The book's lack of direction leaves a little to be desired as well. Still, Edge is one happy camper when it comes to burgers and I could see him hosting one of those half-hour food shows on tv someday.

James Risen's "State of War" may be a thin volume but it's as power-packed an indictment as I've witnessed with regard to the Bush administration thus far. It should be read by everyone in and out of Washington....especially neo-conservatives. This book hits the ground running and doesn't let up for one second."State of War" is centered around the CIA and its troubling relationship with the Bush White House (although Bill Clinton comes in for a fair share of criticism) as the author gives concise judgments on all of the major players surrounding Bush. There are clear winners and losers in Risen's narrative, as Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and George Tenet (to name just three) represent both sides. While Tenet is presented as a sycophant, Rumsfeld and Cheney are really in charge with Rumsfeld simply ignoring directives he doesn't like. Colin Powell, as we know, played by the rules and lost out in the first-term power struggle while Condi Rice is portrayed as second-rate and ineffectual. As told by Risen, the current president is either detached, uninterested or unaware of foreign policy, much to the continuing chagrin of a plurality of Americans. The author makes a persuasive case to support this stance.What makes "State of War" so fascinating beyond the participants is how the Bush people bungled so many things. Richard Clarke gave us a great initial look at this in his excellent book, "Against All Enemies", but Risen takes it even farther (of course much more has unfolded since Clarke's book). Risen's last three chapters deal with the unbelievable mishandling of the situation in Afghanistan, followed by several pages concerning America's complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia and a final chapter regarding MERLIN....a secret plan to confuse Iran on how to assemble a nuclear bomb....a plan that may have actually helped them.Risen reminds us that Bush ran in 2000 trying to assure Americans that he would surround himself with the best team available. Instead we got the Keystone Kops. While the diversion of Iraq continues, the world becomes less safe, due in large part to over-preening egos and an unwarranted sense of political self-preservation and hubris in the nation's capital. "State of War" is a terrific book and I highly recommend it.

While the twentieth century is the basis for our living experiences about homosexuality and the twenty-first century has already witnessed a faster-moving pace of its development, Graham Robb rightly places the emphasis on where we should look for guidance.... the nineteenth century. What a job the author has done!Robb points out at the onset that the Victorian Age, prudish and mannered as it is remembered, was not necessarily all that it appeared. These hundred years witnessed an explosive expos&eacute; of gay life, especially through literature and "science". It is new to me that the word "homosexual" first appeared in 1870....before that there was no real definition of a person who was attracted to people of the same sex. Far from being an age where untold horrors befell homosexuals in a variety of ways (and they did) Robb points out that this was a time of degrees of acceptance, depending of course on where you lived.Two chapters are worth noting in this book. The first is "Country of the Blind", in which the author relates how the nascent medical profession dealt with homosexuality. This chapter is hilarious on its face but poignant between the lines.... poignant in that many homosexuals for the first time sought help from their ill-equipped doctors with wildly mixed results. The second chapter is "Fairy Tales", a chapter dealing with writers and how they maneuvered in and around sexuality through use of characters in their books.Though there are references to far too many nineteenth century publishings throughout "Strangers" (often without more than a wisp of an example) and while the book lacks an overall cohesion, I would highly recommend it. Graham Robb has given the reader new ways to look at homosexuality, and in doing so, has added more color than ever before to this rich area of human life.

In advance of a television movie of the same name, I decided to read "Prayers for Bobby", written in 1996. It's a tragic and wonderful story at the same time...tragic for Bobby's suicide but wonderful at his mother's complete turnaround regarding her views on homosexuality. It also begs the question of just how far we've come in the twelve years since the book was published and the quarter century since Bobby's death.Bobby Griffith led a tortured life... a closeted teen who was coming to grips with his sexuality and pummeled by a religious mother who wanted him "cured". His diary was often his only companion and through it we are able to see Bobby from the inside out....the loneliness, the depression and the hopelessness. He predicted he wouldn't live a long life, and sadly, that came to pass.Yet his mother was able to realize, through her own grief, how much she had contributed to her own son's lack of self-worth. After his death she got involved in a public way, taking small steps at first as her new identity was being formed. She realized education was the key in helping people overcome homophobia, and to that end she has succeeded. But the book also serves as a reminder that even though things are better in many ways for gays since Bobby's suicide, we really only inch forward as a society. Since the book's publication, Matthew Shepard was murdered and his killing increased awareness of the dangers that still are felt by many gays."Prayers for Bobby" needs to be viewed on both a personal and a public level. It shows the triumph of a woman who so completely changed her life that she and others like her offer hope to those thousands who are still closeted and a yearning for better things to come. I highly recommend it.

The most exciting politician to hit the airwaves over the past couple of years has been Illinois Senator Barack Obama and now with his new book, "The Audacity of Hope", Obama has given more of himself to the public. It is a thoughtful and personal (if somewhat uneven) account of his life, his ideas and his opinions.Obama is at his best in this book when he talks about himself. His story is matchless and it is clear that he has spent time in putting together a narrative that is as compelling as his life story. A quote that stands out for me is this one..."the arguments of liberals are more often grounded in reason and fact". Yes, he's a liberal and proud of it, although he leaves just enough wiggle room to suggest he is more of a compromiser than a risk taker. Perhaps he really is looking more for an extended Senate career than a run for the White House.The downside of "The Audacity of Hope" lies in the fact that a good deal of the book sounds like a campaign platform. The tax cuts favoring the rich, for instance, while soundly repudiated by Senator Obama, is a talking point that still comes across as campaign rhetoric. To be sure, there is a politician in him, for better or worse. For all the insights he offers, Obama sometimes lacks an inventive way of relating them. Still, there is a comprehensive attempt on his part to explain his positions vis-a-vis current realities and as a teacher he is very good.I don't know what kind of president Barack Obama would make should he run and win, but "The Audacity of Hope" is a good start at a national introduction. If the reader can get through the drier points of the book, the personal reflections are well worth the read.

Michael Dobbs had written a fast-paced book of intrigue regarding the eight German saboteurs whose ineptness in carrying out &quot;Operation Pastorius&quot; led to their arrests and eventual jail sentences and executions. The comparison between this historical account and today's Al-Qaeda couldn't be more timely.Dobbs weaves an intricate tale of German plans for the destruction of military and civilian targets in the United States in the spring of 1942. Everything looked good on paper (literally....with the use of invisible ink!) from its inception to the landing of the two U-boats off the coasts of Long Island and Florida. The one weak link happened to be one of the two leaders, George John Dasch, an unstable man who eventually was able to get his cohorts arrested. The author's most impressive offering through much of the book is his ability to get inside the heads of these men....what they were thinking, how and why they acted and especially their interaction with one another. It's a great story to read and is made even more attractive for the simple reality that it all actually took place.What I found to be the best part of &quot;Saboteurs&quot;, however, was the last few chapters. Dobbs covers the miltitary tribunals in pithy detail reserving some of the comedic parts to rivalries between the FBI and other government agencies. What J. Edgar Hoover wouldn't do to enhance his and his bureau's reputation! The culmination, in a sense, led to the defendants' lawyers appearing before the Supreme Court in a last-ditch effort to supercede the war tribunal's very existence as set up by President Roosevelt. One cannot help but compare the situation with that of today....the rivlaries between the CIA and FBI and the friction between the Secretaries of State and Defense. The most fascinating few pages deal with the afterthoughts of some of the Supreme Court justices with regard to the trial and subsequent changes of opinion. One wonders about the parallels of the detainment of these eight men and the hundreds held at Guantanemo today.It is a fitting addition to &quot;Saboteurs&quot; that Michael Dobbs touches on American opinion about the case at that time and how, after the trial was drawing to a close and Americans found out more and more about the saboteurs, that anti-German sentiment began to build. The feelings of Arab-Americans today must be very much connected with those feelings of German-Americans in 1942. This is a powerful book with timely repercussions.

This lighthearted romp of a movie stretches the humor to new lows but in doing so it has a certain charm. Luke Wilson is good as the "smartest person in the world" and Maya Rudolph is cute as a street smart foil to him. What I loved about "Idiocracy" is that it reminds me of Washington today.....it's all a farce...the movie, and the real one, too!

I had "My One and Only" on a list of recent movies I had missed and after viewing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this charming, slightly over-the-top film. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger plays the often beaten down but nonetheless driven mother of two teenage boys, whose own separation from her husband has her, quite literally, driven to leave him. And drive she and the boys do! From Boston to California, it's one missed opportunity after another as Zellweger runs into a cast of losing suitors...several played by actors of note.The pace is decidedly slow, but that makes "My One and Only" all the better. While Zellweger is the glue that holds the family (and the movie) together, a wonderful performance is turned in by Logan Lerman, who plays the older son George. George serves as narrator and his emotional expressiveness is just right for the part. I highly recommend "My One and Only" and I wouldn't be surprised if the viewer might want to see it for a second time.

What does one make of war resisters? The answer is "plenty" and their narratives are wonderfully recounted in "A Few Small Candles"....a book long overdue.The differences between resisiters during World War Two and those that followed twenty five years later in Vietnam certainly owes much to the public outlook on war at each of those times, but in the end it is the stories of those men who contradicted their country's policies that give us their full measure of devotion to peace. After finishing this wonderful little book I came to the conclusion that it is unfair to judge these men simply in light of their times. What becomes clear throughout is the profound conscience with which they "fought" their imprisonment. While not always clear as to every facet of core beliefs they possessed (some were more religious than others)or what course of action they might have deemed necessary to take when faced with prison obstacles, each of these men knew that to register for the armed forces of the United States and thereby be open to being put into a position in which they might have to kill other men was simply not acceptable.It is especially poignant that I read this book during our country's current military battles in the Middle East. One doesn't have to judge them heroes or traitors, but rather men who stood up for what they believed. It is a part of World War Two that has been sadly missing until now and whose relevance helps to complete a more accurate picture of that age.

"The Last King of Scotland", which earned Forest Whitaker a justly deserved Academy Award, is a film of complex simplicity. The naive Nicholas Garrigan arrives in Uganda in 1970 on a whim as a young doctor from Scotland and begins work in a village clinic. A chance meeting with Idi Amin promotes Garrigan to become personal doctor to Amin, and in a reflection of the psychotic Ugandan president, Garrigan also becomes Amin's "most trusted advisor".Everything about this film works. The interplay between the two leading actors is intensely dramatic and I was mesmerized by the performance of Dr. Garrigan by the young Scottish actor, James McAvoy. His character grows up in this film as Amin's remains the same....a child, as Garrigan puts it toward the end. McAvoy is superb and worth every moment of the two-hour film.Disturbing as some scenes are to watch, they are necessary to remind people of the brutality of Idi Amin's reign. Far from being the buffoon by which he was often characterized, Amin was a terrorist who happened to be president of Uganda. The final half hour has a crescendo of heart-pounding action and superb timing. Added to this film's appeal is the beautiful cinematography and the occasional Western-style music....with an African flair, of course."The Last King of Scotland" is an expansive work that succeeds on every level. Whitaker and McAvoy cement this film of a history that needed to be told. I highly recommend it.

"Vision Quest", from 1985, is a wrestling movie that grabs your attention and holds it. The film is well-cast and is headed up by a likeable young Matthew Modine. More than a little innocent, Modine's character, Louden Swain, is a terrific set-up to take on a favored champion opponent. Reminiscent of Robby Benson's "One on One" from a few years prior, "Vision Quest" moves ahead nicely toward a charged last few minutes....the best minutes of the film. The side romance is a bit of a distraction but it is fun to see a young Madonna perform "Crazy For You". This is an appealing film and highly recommendable.

What's so fun about "The Bush Survival Bible" is that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is.....just a little tonic on those days we need one. My advice.......even though you can read this book in the time it takes you to say "nucular", spread it out over a few days or weeks. It's better that way and much more enjoyable. It did get me thinking, however, that maybe I should be counting the days, too. No, then I'd have to re-read the chapters on "New Drinks to Get You By" or "Excellent Antidepressants". But those "Countries to Move to" are looking better every day!

Not long into "Putney Swope" does one figure out that in no way, shape or form could this film be made today. It is irreverent, politically incorrect to the hilt, evocative of the 1960s and often funny as hell.When Putney (Arnold Johnson) becomes the chairman of the board of an all-white advertising company, things change. The dialogue is stiltingly absurd but the real "star" is Putney, himself. His other-worldly voice has a raspy and cutting edge charm and he dispenses logic and advice like an edge of a ripsaw. Robert Downey created a masterpiece with "Putney Swope" and even though it won't be everyone's cup of tea, taken in context of the times in which it was made, it is refreshingly candid, downright offensive and wonderfully made.

Jonathan Mahler's new book, "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning" is a terrific accomplishment that weaves together many fractured elements which helped to contribute to a year that was quite unlike most other years in New York City. It was, by and large, a depressing time for New York but the enormous boost New Yorkers received by the Yankees' World Series victory that October, coupled with a change in mayors shortly thereafter, began to lift the city out of the doldrums. As one who remembers New York in 1977 very well, Mahler has reminded us of a place which seems light years away from the present. It's a walk down memory lane for some of us."The Bronx is Burning" is told in three parts and the least effective part is the first. Necessarily introductory, Mahler's narrative style in Part One never gains much traction. Between the political landscape of the early part of the year and the problematic Yankees, the author doesn't quite bounce back and forth so much as he diarizes. If there is tension to be found in what's to come, it's not found here. Reggie Jackson's ego is certainly a reportable topic but Mahler spends far too much time on him. It's filler that doesn't quite sate. Mahler, however, has plenty of good stuff to come. With Part Two he begins to build a story of intense proportion. From this point on, I couldn't put down the book. He begins by giving us an account, rich in detail, about the first hour of the summer blackout and the hapless Con Edison systems operator who was at the heart of it. Continuing on through the night's ensuing riots, "The Bronx Is Burning" begins to breathe new life. From here the links in the book become clearer. As the events of July, August and September unfold, the city of New York is forced to take a sharper look at itself and there is no better focal point than the upcoming Democratic primary and its characters from central casting. Mahler brilliantly connects the dots at the same time adding an exceptionally good section about the murderer known as the "Son of Sam", who terrorized the city for over a year. The author's final chapters regarding the Yankees' championship are told with clarity and passion.It's hard to remember that all of these events happened in one calendar year but maybe we were so benumbed by those happenings that we tended to overlook their confluence. Jonathan Mahler has brought them all together in "Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx is Burning" and has done so in a way that puts that year back in some of our minds and gives a great account to those who were not yet around to experience it.

"At Canaan's Edge", the final offering in a three-part trilogy by Taylor Branch, is a comprehensive work that stunningly traces the last years of Dr. Martin Luther King with regard to his central place in the civil rights movement. The mid-sixties are defined nationally by the name "King" and for those of us old enough to remember those turbulent times, Branch re-creates the emotions of the day with an uncanny narrative style.The book unfolds with the 1965 Selma, Alabama march and concludes with King's death followed by a short epilogue. While the main focus is on King, two notable players add to the swirling story....Lyndon B. Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. The main intrigue in "At Canaan's Edge" revolves around King's relationship with his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and, to a lesser extent, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The personalities and accompanying egos that surround King are fascinating and Branch does an extraordinary job of bringing them to the surface and connecting them to the context of events of the day.Each year in this book can be remembered in different ways. 1965 was the beginning of the big buildup in Vietnam (the parallel story therein contained) but most of the U.S. citizenry supported Johnson's efforts. King's first large-scale marches, while met with resistance, nonetheless put him in the forefront of the movement and prompted the voting rights act that would soon pass in Congress. 1966 witnessed the first U.S. losses on a scale that would grow even more horrifying in Vietnam as King moved north to confront housing issues in Chicago. The year also gave rise to "black power" and Stokely Carmichael as well as the women's movement. By 1967 King and much of the country had turned against the war and those within King's circle often debated how far King should tie himself to the anti-war movement. If he did, would this be seen as a diversion and a weakening of the cause for civil rights or, as a peace issue, would they be concomitant? 1968 proved to be the most explosive year...a year in which King would only see the first hundred days.Branch demonstrates that King's power hit its ne plus ultra earlier rather than later...a major point often forgotten about King. By the time of his assassination, King was in danger of becoming a pariah within his own movement, (he had long since ceased to meet face-to-face with LBJ) although he did retain a swell of support from blacks as a whole. Curiously, the term "black" was just coming into acceptance in 1968...when one remembers King's speeches the term "negro" is almost always used.J. Edgar Hoover looms large behind both King and LBJ. The wiretaps (unknown to King and his associates) certainly made King's life more difficult as the FBI director sought continually to discredit King at every turn. Hoover is, without doubt, the man behind the curtain pulling the strings. Branch's juggling of these three men is skillful and often eye-popping and his keen sense of detail makes this book a treasure. Although "At Canaan's Edge" is somewhat lengthy, the author keeps the flow going and not once did I find myself mired in a dusty story. I did smile at one thing, however.....Branch loves the word "peroration".American Society probably changed more in the twentieth century during the brief moment from 1965 to 1968 than at any other time. To relive those raw years again through Taylor Branch's wonderful book "At Canaan's Edge" is a tribute to the author and his terrific book. I admire his work in this effort and encourage those with a sense of history particular to this time to read it.

The wonderful thing about reading books concerning the US Presidents is that these men represent a finite group.....forty-two men and forty-three presidencies. Writing for "The American Presidents" series, Zachary Karabell has offered up a slightly expanded thumbnail sketch of our twenty-first president, Chester Alan Arthur.Since Arthur held the office of president, someone has to write about him. The problem with President Arthur is that not much about him survives. Most of his papers were destroyed after his death, so Karabell must rely largely on newspaper accounts of the day mixed in with a few anecdotes regarding the president, which, as the author mentions, may or may not be true.We know that Arthur was a bon vivant, never aspired to the presidency and was passable at being the chief executive during his tenure from 1881-1885. Indeed, most presidential ratings place Arthur squarely in the middle or slightly below. Even the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, the most important piece of legislation passed during Arthur's presidency, was not a direct act of Arthur's leadership. (I think one more lasting thing to come out of the Arthur years, which Karabell doesn't touch on, is the adoption of Standard Time)The author does his best to be fair. The few parts of this book with any real drama are Arthur's dealings with Senators Roscoe Conkling and James G. Blaine. The president certainly had a balancing act to do with these two bitter adversaries.Chester Alan Arthur undoubtedly brought style and grace to the presidency and presided over a few relatively quiet and prosperous years in the United States. We should at least give him credit for that.

If you ask most people what they know about Benjamin Harrison they might tell you two things they remember from history class...that he was the grandson of a president (William Henry Harrison) and that his term was sandwiched in between the two non-consecutive terms of Grover Cleveland. Beyond that, Benjamin Harrison remains a mystery to most, but author Charles Calhoun has done a crisp and clear job of relating Harrison's life and term in office.This is the third of the American Presidents series I have read and I think that these books serve better in telling the stories of the more obscure presidents. The brief length of the Harrison book (as well as the ones I've read about Arthur and Harding) give just enough overview regarding these men. They are nice "starter" books, which might, one would hope, prompt the reader to seek out deeper accounts of the lives of these presidents. That said, Calhoun's book offers a good flow of information. Harrison is usually rated in the middle of the presidential mix, and Calhoun creates no impression that Harrison should be moved up or down. He was a solid, if stoic president with some notable legislative accomplishments. While never rising to the stature that a more forceful president might have, Harrison nonetheless fought for rights of blacks to vote and was keen on providing a pension for Union veterans of the Civil War. It was fascinating to read that Frederick Douglass said of Harrison, "to my mind, we never had a greater president". That's certainly high praise coming from one of the leading abolitionists of the nineteenth century and a man who knew Abraham Lincoln personally. Harrison had a few challenges abroad, but his four years were generally quiet as the country saw the passage of such landmark legislation as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Harrison's political problems as president seemed to stem as much from members of his own Republican party, especially his wily Secretary of State, James G. Blaine. Through a combination of forces against him, Harrison lost badly to Grover Cleveland in 1892.Calhoun tells of the president's dalliance with and subsequent marriage to his wife's niece, Mary (Mame) Dimmick...it's a colorful addition to the life of a pious president. The rift that this marriage caused seems never to have healed with his two adult children as Harrison died just five years after his second wedding.Benjamin Harrison may have been a footnote in history but Charles Calhoun has rightly written about him. After all, there have been only forty-two different occupants of the presidential chair...and Harrison was one of them. I recommend this book for its insight and easy narrative style.

Kevin Phillips has, over the years, made some terrific contributions to the American political discourse. While there is something to be said in his approach to William McKinley, this offering is more of an attempt to raise our 25th president's stature in comparison to other presidents.Ratings of U. S. presidents have more or less evened out over decades but William McKinley hasn't fared too well. Phillips tends to explain McKinley's kindness, piety and duty to his invalid wife as excuses for weakness as seen by others, meanwhile promoting the realignment of the political landscape of 1896 and the GOP successes that occurred in following years as a direct result of McKinley's skill and ingenuity. That's a stretch. While President McKinley had some notable successes he was also the product of a lot of luck. The depression of the 1890s and the highly unsuccessful candidacy of William Jennings Bryan created a perfect storm for his elevation to the presidency and the quick victory in the Spanish-American War helped promote his popularity.A near great president as Phillips suggests? I don't think McKinley qualifies. However, he was a hinge president in the sense that American life began to turn towards prosperity in the industrial age during his tenure in the White House as Americans entered the twentieth century. That McKinley did not survive to see the end of his second term will always keep the door open on his legacy.

John W. Dean's new short biography of Warren G. Harding, the twenty-ninth president of the United States, is a welcome addition to the scant amount of good literature on the president who enjoyed a great reputation while in office, but sank to the bottom of the list when scandals and corruption in his administration were exposed after his death. For us Harding enthusiasts Dean's book makes the explicit point that Harding wasn't really all that bad...that after all, he had some successes in the abbreviated term he served from 1921-1923. To this end, I believe Dean has made a strong case.Warren Harding was a man whose entire life seemed to be clouded in intrigue and mystery. It's always been a wonder to me why historians haven't written more about him. From the gossipy "The Shadow of Blooming Grove" (1968) through Dean's book, one senses a definite uptick in Harding's reputation. Dean recites Harding's accomplishments....the Washington disarmament conference (1921-22), the creation of the Bureau of the Budget and his naming of former president William Howard Taft to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The author gives Harding praise for his efforts to help settle the coal and railroad strikes and his ability to stand up to Congress when he thought he was right. In Dean's book President Harding comes across more forcefully than in other books I've read about this president.Dean suggests that one of Harding's biggest political achievements was his ability not to make enemies. Of course, this was his biggest problem, too. Dean is careful not to elevate Harding too high and the overall success of this book is to keep Harding out of the cellar of the ranking of presidents. Perhaps that space can now be occupied by James Buchanan.John Dean conquers no new real historic ground. The book is very short and more, I think, aimed at readers who don't know too much about Warren Harding. Dean's prose is sometimes a bit wooden and I wish he had included a few more photographs. I particularly enjoyed the section on Harding's selection of the cabinet and the comments about Harding's speaking style and substance by William McAdoo and H.L. Mencken (page 73) are very funny.Was Warren G. Harding fit for the presidency? Even Harding wondered about that, himself. John Dean has essentially said "yes" and I agree with him. The author has presented a well-researched book and one that deserves to be read.

It must be hard to write a short biography of our longest-serving and one of our greatest presidents, but Roy Jenkins succeeds. His writings about Franklin Delano Roosevelt cover the essentials of his twelve-year presidency and he gives the reader a nice feel about the man, himself. Sadly, we read, the author died the same year this book was published."The American Presidents" series has produced some fine bios about our presidents...I think most presidents are now included in the series and I've read about half of them. With one notable exception (Andrew Johnson) the authors try to give a balanced approach to ther subjects. Because of the need to be concise, Jenkins spends little time on FDR's childhood, preferring to describe the state of his marriage to Eleanor and comparisons to his equally famous cousin, Theodore Roosevelt.I found it fascinating that a British writer and politician was given the task of preparing this book, but considering one of its main thrusts...the Second World War...it becomes clear that the connection between the two countries is fair game for a foreign writer. Jenkins is a student of history and adds to the mix his own feelings about FDR's counterpart, Winston Churchill. I especially enjoyed pondering the question that Jenkins proposes...just when did FDR consider running for a third term? He also goes into depth about fellow politicians of the time and weighs the benefits and downsides of FDR's three Vice Presidents...John Nance Garner, Henry Wallace and Harry Truman.Having just visited FDR's home at Hyde Park it was fun to read again about the life of this extraordinary public servant. This short biography is certainly a terrific addition to "The American Presidents" series and I highly recommend it.

This is an inspired book in two ways....the puzzles and cartoons themselves that are presented...and the way they are arranged with head-scratching calculations needed to "solve" each page. While not ordered in a particular way the categories are comprised of things like match the caption with the appropriate cartoon, acrostics, two-step processes and a couple of terrific cartoon "disassemblages"."The New Yorker Book of Cartoon Puzzles and Games" is perfect for a long car or plane trip, (it's spiral-bound to make things easier) for a rainy day, or a quick romp through one or more of the fantastic offerings. I highly recommend it and the reader/solver will have lots of fun with it!

Owen King is off and running with his new book, "We're All in This Together", a collection of stories nicely put together by the author. If this book is any indication, the author has a luster-filled career ahead of him.Beginning with the "novella", after which King's book is named, he takes us through four more engrossing (and occasionally "grossing"!) short stories. His finest offering is the novella itself, where politics mix with paint balls and odd family connections. King is terrifically descriptive and his attention to detail is engaging. The state of Maine figures prominently throughout the book, as one would understand, given his own background. The stories which follow are mostly fine but sometimes a little uneven. "My Second Wife", which concludes the book, is the richest and the warmest. "Frozen Animals" and "Snake" are filled with humor. Only "Wonders" kept me from giving this book five stars.Owen King has produced a book that leaves me wanting to read his next one. "We're All in This Together" is well worth the read for its scope, depth and pace. I highly recommend it.

David Mindich's new book, "Tuned Out" is a well-researched, if short attempt to tell us something we already know...that younger people, as a rule, pay scant attention to the news. The serious news, that is. Armed with collected data Mindich plows on, like a good college professor, describing in detail how the younger generation has tuned out. Indeed, the narrative often suggests that the reader is in the author's classroom as he dissects the problems associated with the topic. This is not your easy summer (or winter) read.Anyone who has ever seen the segment on the "Tonight Show" called "Jaywalking" (where Jay Leno asks younger people on the street things about which they should know) will recognize the utter alarm many of us feel at the lack of knowledge these people being interviewed possess. Could these citizens really be THAT far removed from current events and history? They are. Mindich's book is like "Jaywalking" without the fun.The author does make some excellent points. He devotes part of a chapter to local news and how appallingly bad most of it is. He's certainly right on that score. He also raises a question in his conclusion regarding civics. He writes, "we demand a civics test of everyone who wants to become a U.S. citizen; it seems fitting to have high school students take a news/civics test, too." This is an equally good point. We test citizens-to-be and then let them loose, in a manner of speaking, never to ask anything more of them once they become citizens.I'm leery, however, of Mindich's assertion that we are in a "crisis". The lack of young people's interest in the news is growing and is disturbing but it is also an evolution which may or may not be as bad as he warns. Still, I recommend the bookfor its acknowledgement of the problems that we, who are tuned in, face with those who are not, as a society.

Throughout my life Wendell Willkie has always been portrayed as a colorful footnote to history... a man who rose from near obscurity and, with the help of convention galleries cheering him on, overcame more staid Republican opposition to face Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the general election of 1940. After reading "Five Days in Philadelphia", I'm convinced that Willkie's place in American history should stay just about where it has rested for over sixty years.Willkie's story (and political timing) make a good book and Charles Peters has done a very good job at enlightening the reader about Willkie's life, both personal and political. Born in 1892 to rather prominent citizens of Elwood, Indiana, Willkie eventually taught history in Coffeyville, Kansas before going on to become a lawyer. Peters points out that Willkie was in all ways larger than life, had a penchant for booze and cigarettes and had a lifelong "wandering eye" for women. His lengthy affair with Herald Tribune editor Irita Van Doren was kept private for the most part, although it is fascinating to think that the two major presidential candiates of 1940 could have had serious political troubles had their affairs been exposed.Peters is at his best when he tells of the five days of the Republican convention in June, 1940. It's nice to be reminded of a time when the convention choices were actually decided at the conventions and not in an arduous primary system as we have today. The author captures the events dramatically....from the searing heat to the deal-making to the roaring demonstrations...all of this is related with wonderful intensity. Had it not been for key players like Sam Pryor and Joe Martin, Willkie would never have been able to overcome the forces of Thomas E. Dewey and Senators Taft and Vandenberg."Five Day in Philadelphia" takes a strange turn, however, after the Republican convention for from here on out the focus is on FDR. It is at this juncture that the reader is reminded that the real players were people in the Democratic party...not only FDR, but his advisor Harry Hopkins, FDR's near convention opponent, James Farley, Eleanor Roosevelt and people on down the line. Much is made, as it should have been, about the discussion of lending Great Britain fifty destroyers and the debate about resuming the draft, but Willkie seems largely left out of the picture, except for a few references about how he helped strengthen Roosevelt's hand with his support for Britain. Peters repeatedly makes the assertion that Willkie's nomination was far better for the country, but I'm not convinced of that. Had Taft, Dewey or Vandenberg been the nominee, the lines between any of them and FDR would have been much more clearly delineated and may have given the president an easier time persuading the country about the perils of Hitler....a direction in which the country seemed to be headed already at the time.Wendell Willkie was in the national spotlight for roughly six months. I'm sure there were times that his support of FDR was welcome but I don't think that Charles Peters makes a very good case for making Willkie so influential. It's a leap of faith that doesn't work very well.Still, "Five Days in Philadelphia" is a good book and one that adds to our knowledge of Wendell Willkie, a colorful character who captured the American spirit for a brief moment. The book is an often swift read and the narrative is written well. For those reasons it is a worthwhile venture.

Benita Eisler had written a concise and powerful book about the life of Frederic Chopin, including his loves, his music and his friends. Beginning with a colorful account of Chopin's funeral, the author then begins to weave together a tormented picture of him. His many illnesses, the distance from those he loved, his constant need for funds....all describe a life of unbelievable turmoil. Eisner is able to capture the essence of Chopin brilliantly and relate it to the reader with strokes of understanding and compassion.While Chopin's relationship with George Sand has been well-documented over the years, the author, nonetheless, gives an emotional portrayal of their lives together...and apart. It is the central part of this book, as it should be. But how many readers know the influence that Sand's children had on him....especially Solange? Chopin relied heavily on both women but it was Solange who comforted him at the composer's end.As a pianist, I enjoyed Eisner's brief and occasional comments on Chopin's compositions. They always seemed to complement her narrative and they were never too weighty to drag down any chapter. Her writing style is often brisk but not in any way capricious. The &quot;photo&quot; taken of Chopin towards the end of his life says it all. A man barely five feet tall, weighing little by a body wracked with suffering....a man in this condition who could still write some of the most expansive music. Eisner secures it all...she allows the reader to have great empathy and awe for Chopin.It's a rare occurrence that a dust jacket adds so much to the book. It's really designed to give the look and feel of a first edition classic. Eisner's &quot;Chopin's Funeral&quot; is a highly recommended, thoroughly enjoyable book.

Stephen Glass had it all.....a bright mind and an easy and articulate manner, he nonetheless blew it with deceiving his superiors with false articles he presented to his bosses at The New Republic. His downfall was inevitable, though the best part of the film doesn't make it seem that way too early.Hayden Christensen gives a solid performance as the deceptor, but the film really belongs to Peter Sarsgaard, his superior at the magazine. The tension created is well focused on Sarsgaard as well as its resolution. This is based on a true story and the film rings true, itself. I highly recommend it.

Jonathan Rauch's new book, "Gay Marriage" is just what the country needs right now....less shouting and more reason. Rauch wisely frames his arguments regarding homosexuality in America around the issue of marriage as it has emerged in a rapid-fire way as the central social issue of the day.De-mystifying most of the arguments made by conservatives, Rauch nonetheless is willing to be open and fair with them...to a point. His point, that same-sex marriage will be good for everyone is accurate, but as he also stresses it could have the possibility of a downside in its implementation. His premise reflects the old saying, "a rising tide lifts all boats".Rauch encourages the reader to think about the issue which is good advice as it seems that so many in the United States more viscerally react to the idea of same-sex marriage than give it a mindful rendering. In his discussion regarding what some perceive to be an immature side to homosexuality I wish he had made note of one thing.....the fact that a few states allow heterosexual minors to marry... Hawaii and Georgia for instance, allow marriages at sixteen.The author makes it clear that until gay marriage is accepted homosexuals will continue to be viewed as second-class citizens. Civil unions just won't do, he remarks, but adds that at least they are better than nothing. His beginning and ending chapters reflect what all gays feel and all straights should read....imagining a life without the possibility of marriage. Jonathan Rauch gives clarity to his arguments and a hope that marriage will someday be an option for all people. His book is not so much ahead of its time, but more appropriately right on time....and right on the mark.

For a man who had the chance to write an in-depth book about his very famous boss, Richard Blow has not succeeded. While first reading through "American Son" I thought the author treated his subject with a certain amount of distance and reverence. As I continued, that reverence simply became timidity.One learns surprisingly little about John F. Kennedy, Jr. in this book. Some may not know that JFK, Jr. had a temper or he liked to stroke his wife's hair when she visited him at the office. But I kept waiting for more and I think that Mr. Blow, while not hiding his love of JFK, Jr. has done a disservice....in an attempt to humanize him, the author has made Mr. Kennedy appear to be less of an interesting figure than he probably was.Richard Blow writes in an even, readable style. As with most things about JFK, Jr., however, the best part of "American Son" might just be the cover.

Before reading Brian Lamb's terrific book about Presidential gravesites, I counted the number of these sites that I had visited....11 to be exact. Now, after finishing the book, I want to visit the remaining ones. Mr. Lamb's ability to teach us about the lives (and in this case, the deaths) of these remarkable public servants goes well beyond C-Span. He has crafted a most enjoyable and educational book...one that should be in every home. This is a book that can be read at almost any pace...each chapter is short and well-laid out. He reminds us that every president has been important in some way because of the fact that they have all held the highest office in America... not just Washington, Lincoln and the Roosevelts, but Fillmore, Arthur and Taft as well. How important is must have been, for instance, for the children of the nation to donate their pennies to build the Harding Memorial in Marion, Ohio. The death of a president is a major event in our country's history and Mr. Lamb (along with chapter postscripts by Richard Norton Smith, who further humanizes our presidents) has succeeded in a winning form with his book. I found nothing maudlin or morose about &quot;Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb&quot;...only a colorful walk through America's past.

As we've seen in books by Paul O'Neill, Richard Clarke and others, the Bush administration's deceit is finally coming to light. Who better to open the windows than John Dean? &quot;Worse than Watergate&quot; is an important addition to this surfeit of new books revealing the inner workings of the current White House.For those of us weaned on Watergate, Dean's book recalls the days of the exposure of a growing scandal in the Nixon White House. The author's main thrust is secrecy as he compares both administrations and finds, rather surprisingly to himself at first, that what the Bush/Cheney &quot;co-presidency&quot; is engaging in is far worse than what Nixon ever concocted. From the war in Iraq to stonewalling to attempts to intimidate Congress, Dean constructs an argument that is most persuasive. He adds to his list the environment, Cheney's secretive and shady business practices, and attempts through various means to make the executive branch more imperial than ever.Dean makes some basic premises with regard to why Bush's obsession with secrecy and duplicity is worse than Nixon's. He reserves his worst case for the exposure of Valerie Plame, (former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife) which in an attempt to discredit Wilson could have ended up with her death or compromised national security.As many of us continue to wonder why the press hasn't been more aggressive, Dean criticizes some in the press for not being harder on Bush and cites the important role of the media for garnering and disseminating information to the public, especially with an administration that is bent on wrapping themselves in a shroud. The fourth estate, he suggests, is doing a less than adequate job.In August, 2002, we awoke to hear that suddenly Iraq had become a threat to our national security. Since then, so much of what the Bush White House told us regarding the need to go to war has proven to be false. Dean points out that if Bush/Cheney get re-elected in November (he refers to them not as &quot;leaders&quot; but &quot;rulers&quot;) their path toward further secrecy may very well lead to their ultimate demise at a great cost to the United States.John Dean offers many memorable quotes throughout &quot;Worse than Watergate&quot; and I think my favorite and the one most apropos is a quote from Woodrow Wilson. Wilson said, &quot;the only truly self-governing people is that people which discusses and interrogates its administration.&quot; So far we haven't had much of that interrogation of Bush and Cheney, but I have a feeling that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. This spring and summer may be the Bush administration's &quot;winter of discontent&quot;.

Relationships between fathers and sons are often complicated and the one expressed here, in "Le Grand Voyage", is no different. In fact, the chasm between Reda (Nicolas Cazal&eacute;) and his elderly father (Mohamed Majd) is so wide that it seems insurmountable to fill. Yet, the sudden 3,000 mile journey that the two make between France and Mecca explores this relationship exceedingly well.Unsure that he will ever make the pilgrimage to Mecca due to his advancing age and health, Reda's father sternly asks Reda to take him. Not in a plane, as Reda would have preferred, but by car. They traverse Italy, the Balkans, Turkey and Syria, running into all sorts and conditions of people. Neither Reda nor his father can quite figure the other one out, but by the end and in a final touching scene, the film comes full circle."Le Grand Voyage" was a break out film for Cazal&eacute;, a rising star and compelling leading man. But this film really belongs to Majd. He is perfectly attuned to the idiosyncrasies of his role and he is a pleasure to watch. This is a lovely film in many ways and I highly recommend it.

I welcomed in summer today by finishing Michael Pollan's wonderful book, "Omnivore's Dilemma". It's a treat from beginning to end. The amount of knowledge, well-researched by the author, is astonishing and it is matched by a seamless narrative. Who would have thought that one could write chapter after chapter about corn, grass and other elements in the food chain and keep it so enlightened? Pollan does just that, much to his credit.Although the three main sections are listed as "Corn", "Grass" and "The Forest," the author also includes chapters on slaughtering, hunting and gathering (of mushrooms) as subtexts. The joy of reading "Omnivore's Delight" is watching Pollan, hardly a rural kind of guy, try his hand at just about everything. If you've never slit the throat of a chicken or shot a wild boar, he will tell you because of his first-hand experience. While some readers undoubtedly have performed these labors, most have not and he lays his contradictory feelings out on the line for all to see. A less experienced writer would not have been able to keep himself in the picture without getting in his own way, but Pollan manages to relate things in a manner that is always appealing."Omnivore's Dilemma" may not be for the faint of heart but it is a great look at where food comes from, how it's processed and how agricultural production differs from large scale to small. Michael Pollan took the time to answer a question that we all ask frequently...."what's for dinner?" I highly recommend his book for its educational approach and warm writing style.

When an administration clothes itself in secrecy, oblivious to the history of a region before charging into war, it runs the risk of failure. As Rashid Khalidi carefully explains, this is exactly what is happening in Iraq and the consequences will long be felt. &quot;Resurrecting Empire&quot; is a hard-hitting critique of a White House that has gotten us into a mess with no end in sight. It is a timely book exposing the naivete of leaders with tunnel vision.The author writes with a serious and often weighty pen; this is not a book to be read in one sitting. Khalidi effectively lays out the history of the region, the strategic importance of oil, the Palestinian/Israeli situation and America's reactions and responses to what has happened in the Middle East prior to the U.S. occupation of Iraq, and what the ramifications may be. I found those chapters about oil and Palestine to be the most fascinating sections of the book. Oil is an issue that the Bush White House doesn't like to talk about too much and the Palestinian question, as the author points out, has become even more of a problem with the administration's tilt toward Israel.&quot;Resurrecting Empire&quot; is a highly laudable work and is for the serious reader who wants to get to know more about the heart and the history of this volatile region of the world. Had Bush and his cronies made any attempt to learn more of what the Middle East is like, the United States might not be in the rough situation we face in Iraq today.

Many years ago I read Jim Bishop's "The Day Lincoln was Shot" and for the first time learned in greater depth about John Wilkes Booth and his accomplices. Edward Steers's new book, "Blood on the Moon", goes much farther in untangling the web of men and women who took part in the Lincoln assassination. Controversy will always surround the events concerning Lincoln's murder but Mr. Steers has done a magnificent job in attempting to set the record straight.The reader will be reminded that Booth's original plan was to kidnap Lincoln and take him across Confederate lines. It wasn't until late March, 1865 that Booth's plans changed to killing Lincoln and other officials high up in the U.S.government. Mr. Steers writes in a detailed but moving prose, carefully laying out the cases for the guilty. He particularly targets Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, whose name has been attempted to have been cleared by historical revisionists. I felt Mr. Steers's best chapter recounts Booth's escape through the Maryland countryside and his subsequent death in Virginia. The final chapter, too, regarding Lincoln's last trip home to Illinois is moving.The book is accompanied by some good photos...one taken of Lincoln's death bed moments after his body was removed and one of Lincoln lying in state....the latter only discovered in the twentieth century after being lost for years. However it's Mr. Steers's connecting the pieces of the conspiracy puzzle that set this book apart from the rest. Nicely readable and often riveting, I highly recommend it.

This film, set in eastern France, is a true-to-life story of a grocer incapacitated by poor health and his son who chooses to come to the aid of the family business...in this case, a traveling grocery. It's hard to believe that the star of "The Grocer's Son", Nicolas Cazal&eacute;, (with his matinee idol good looks) could ever be the black sheep of the family, but here he is, and he accomplishes his role with just the right amount of passion and distance.As he begins to travel around the countryside in his portable van, Antoine (Cazal&eacute;) finds that his customers aren't always what he bargained for and in the process, turns many of them off. But his girlfriend, Claire, (Clotilde Hesme) comes to the rescue and charms those on his route. The tensions abound between Antonio, his father, (the chief antagonist) his understanding but ineffectual mother and his headstrong brother. Yet at the end, Antonio has grown in his understanding of people in general, and his family in particular. It makes for a wonderful film and I highly recommend it.

"Manhattan Skyscrapers", a book first offered in 1999, has been updated since 9/11, but the central thrust remains......there is no other place on earth that gives us so many tall buildings on such small parcels of land. As one who has worked at the Empire State Building for a dozen years, "Manhattan Skyscrapers" makes me want to see as many of these wonders as I can.This is a coffee table book to be sure, but that doesn't take anything away from the richness of Norman McGrath's often stunning photographs and the accompanying descriptions by author Eric P. Nash. Beginning with the 1896 American Tract Society Building (hardly a skyscraper by today's standards) the reader is treated to a chronological trip up and down Manhattan. There are many old black and white photos that are included, giving us a perspective on how the city has evolved architecturally. (Yes, there is a section on the twin towers, as there should be)I was particularly enamored of the older buildings, especially the Flatiron Building (1902) with its one-of-a-kind design but the newer buildings, such as Citicorp Center, the W.R. Grace Building and the oddly suggestive Lipstick Building also warrant attention. Having viewed the outside of these marvels of creation it would be nice to see a book about the interiors of some of them.....the lobby of the Empire State Building, for one.Nash and McGrath have compiled a gem of a book. I encourage readers to have a look and take your time with it. It's worth every page turn.

Miranda Carter's intriguing new book has everything one would want if this had been merely a spy novel. The good news is that Anthony Blunt was the real thing. Carter's in-depth approach and occasional analysis takes what could have been an ordinary book and raises it several notches. She gives the reader an astounding amount of the rich detail of Blunt's life from his birth to his death while still allowing one to judge Blunt's actions in the context of his times. How one man could move so effortlessly through the upper crust of British society (he maintained good relations with the Royal family) while passing documents to Russia over a period of years without the knowledge of his family and many of his friends is a mystery deserving of a book like this one.Unfortunately, the narrative sometimes suffers. Carter's writing style, while informative, tends to be dry and overloaded with names that have little bearing on Blunt's life. With often minimal introduction to the large cast of characters she tends to dive into paragraphs as if she were in the middle of an explanation. I found myself on many an occasion wanting to reach for a roster of names as I tried to remember how each one fit in to the story. It has the tendency of slowing down the reading almost to a point of disinterest.That being said, this book is well worth it. Carter has given us a unique look at a man whose double life (in so many ways) was extraordinary. Her service to her subject and to us lies in her research. Each reader may come to different conclusions about Anthony Blunt but it is to Miranda Carter's credit that she has taken the time and the care to present him to us.

"Night at the Museum" has a great premise (and great promise) but it simply doesn't deliver. A lot of Hollywood energy was wasted on this film especially since Ben Stiller, a fine actor, has not much more to do than look scared and escape predators. It was particularly sad to see such stars as Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney reduced to the little more than cameo roles they play. Robin Williams, however, is very good as Theodore Roosevelt.The film could have captured a wonderful innocence that reminded me of "Home Alone 2", this time with the protagonist as an adult/child rather than a young boy. "Night at the Museum" has some wonderful special effects but be warned that this film is not for very young viewers...the dinosaur scenes, especially near the beginning, can be truly frightening."Night at the Museum" tries hard but it never rings true.

This all-time classic is even better with the Blu-Ray edition....another reason to watch it again. Strong performances are from everyone...especially Jem and Scout. If you've never seen "To Kill a Mockingbird" this is the time to do so. If you have seen it before, it's well worth another look. Highly recommended!

In the wake of the recent death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il there is probably no more important international documentary to watch now than "Seoul Train", an hour-long film from 2005. It follows three groups of people trying to escape North Korea, each meeting with different fates. What is most surprising, however, is to learn about the Chinese moves of repatriation for North Koreans who made it across the border.This is a chilling but highly informative film and should be seen by all who care about North Koreans and wonder what their collective fate is now that their longtime leader is dead and power is in uncertain hands. I highly recommend "Seoul Train".

Bob Woodward's revealing new book, &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; is a clear window into what went on behind closed doors at the White House as the United States moved closer to war in Iraq. It is really two books in one. The first segment, (90% of the book) deals with President Bush and his small cadre of advisors gradually preparing for war. Woodward lets the principal players speak largely for themselves and what is disclosed is an administration keen on the attack (except for Colin Powell and Richard Armitage) but one with little insight or knowledge as to what to do with Iraq once the United States had achieved a military victory. It is not surprising to have diverse views in a cabinet, especially at times of impending battle, but Woodward implies a somewhat spokesless pattern to the war's preparation. It seems increasingly certain the Bush White House intended to go to war and to plan it anyway they could. The one part of this book that is almost amusing to read (were the mission not so dangerous) concerns the ROCKSTARS...the CIA contacts within Iraq. These sections often read like a spy novel and add drama to an otherwise excellent but sometimes plodding account.What is reserved for the epilogue (the second &quot;book&quot;) is the most telling part of &quot;Plan of Attack&quot;. Woodward describes through his interviews where we have come since last year, and not suprisingly, it isn't a rosy picture. He would certainly have a few more things to add since the book's publication a few weeks ago. For those admirers of the president one might see a hands-on, determined leader. For others though, there is a sense that &quot;maybe we didn't do this right&quot; and with such blind faith resolution it becomes more and more apparent that the Bush administration has painted itself into a corner. A post-mortem thought that Armitage had (where he wondered if he and Powell hadn't become the &quot;enablers&quot; of this war) struck a nerve in me. Surely it would have been an uphill battle for them to change any minds in this administration but given the present-day situation in Iraq one can only speculate how things could have gone better.

"The Illusionist", an often overlooked movie of 2006, is out on DVD and worth a viewing. Edward Norton is one of today's finest actors and he is the reason to watch it...Norton carries the film with enormous sensitivity and reserve and should have been nominated for an Academy award... he's that good.The plot is somewhat predictable with the outcome never in doubt. But the cinematography is beautiful and the score is haunting. Overall, "The Illusionist" never plumbs the depths of emotion that it could have but fine performances all around give the film authenticity. I highly recommend it.

It's hard to know how to begin a review about a book that at once seems so outrageously comical but at its core is so earnestly serious. In that we have, "The Clumsiest People in Europe", a compilation of writings by the erstwhile Englishwoman, Favell Lee Mortimer. This book is a dandy!Introduced and edited by Todd Pruzan, (who seems to have many of the same reactions that I did in reading Mrs. Mortimer) "The Clumsiest People in Europe" is a title that represents the tip of the iceberg to Mrs. Mortimer's harsh assessments of the peoples of the civilized, and in proper Victorian vogue, the UNcivilized peoples of the world. As Pruzan remarks, Mrs. Mortimer ventured out of England only twice in her life, so her reviews of the world are made even the more, well, let's say, curious. Nary a country escapes her scrutinies and admonishments. In that regard, Mrs. Mortimer is an equal opportunity employer. Spaniards are "cruel, sullen and revengeful". The country is full of robbers and wolves. After being barely benignly cruel, Mrs. Mortimer says of the Swedes, "you are ready to think the Swedes are a wise and good people. Not so. There is no country in Europe where so many people are put in prison." And so it goes. As she goes farther east and south, Mrs. Mortimer opens up with more vengeance. Suffice it to say she despises drink, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, blacks, Asians, the poor, idleness, tobacco and gambling. Mrs. Mortimer was born just the wrong side of prozac.Beyond the humor applied to today, one has to take a different look at Mrs. Mortimer's offerings. What was her motive in putting together these accounts? I have a sense that there was a serious purpose of educating those she felt needed to be educated. Her readers must have been mostly British, of course, and as much as she disdains most things, she has pretty harsh words for England (though she manages to make sure that England is THE superior country to all, throughout her chapters).The most intriguing aspects of Mrs. Mortimer's writings are her comments about slavery. Though slavery had been abolished only twenty years before she took up the quill, there is no doubt that she wanted to instruct her readers that slavery was a horrible institution. Although the United States comes across pretty well in her estimation, she spends a good amount of time sniffing about how America still practices it. She also declares that in Canada, (or "British America", then) "there are no slaves. There never can be any in countries that belong to Britain".My final thoughts are of a woman who, ensconced in a country nearing the height of its power, wished not only to tell people about the dangers of every evil, but in a subtler way, how they should live their lives. It's a remarkable equivalent to those in the United States today, who are updated versions of Mrs. Mortimer.The short historical introductions by Todd Pruzan are effective and welcome. I urge you to buy a copy of "The Clumsiest People in Europe" and enjoy the many facets of Mrs. Mortimer's writings. She was, indeed, a woman of her times.

Todd Tucker's new book, "Notre Dame vs. The Klan" is one of those efforts that reports an incident in American history and helps to broaden its larger scope in the process. In doing so, the author has enlightened his readers as to what the climate might have been like in Indiana in 1924.Tucker gives a decent overview of the Klan's history and gives a more fascinating look at the emerging prominence of Notre Dame. This book would be an ideal primer for Notre Dame students (one of my former students plays on the current Notre Dame football squad) and to that end, I think this book has merit. However, linking the Notre Dame incident and the Klan's demise is more than a bit of a stretch. Historical novels tend to see things in a more readable light but even given the author's admission of creating a narrative of his own, I commend his efforts.

Walter Isaacson's sweeping new book about one of the great minds in life is a tribute to Albert Einstein through his life and his work. For those of us who know the renowned physicist through equations and reputation, Isaacson fills in the rest. Einstein's creativity and his abiltity to think far past others added so much dimension to the arena of science while his personal life was just as rich with detail. In "Einstein", the author reveals a dashing history.As Isaacson says, Einstein wondered early on what it would be like to ride alongside a light beam. This kind of thinking outside the box led to a lifetime of successes and a few failures, as well. The good and the bad are covered here. What is so striking about this book is that the reader seems to grow with the subject. One cheers Einstein on in his youth as he throws convention out the window, bucks hierarchy and generally goes his own way. Later in life, as Einstein becomes more reasoned (but nonetheless no less radical) we understand the transformation. This is the key to the enjoyment of reading "Einstein"...the humanness of his person shines.There are a couple of chapters which took me by surprise and are terrific additions to the book. One is titled "Einstein's God", a look at how science and religion may or may not be reconciled in Einstein's eyes, and a chapter on the "Red Scare". That Einstein should have lived through the McCarthy era and had the wits to comment on it is fortuitous, indeed."Einstein" may just be the best read of the year. Isaacson's narrative style flows and while there are a lot of technical points about physics necessary to the the story, it never for a minute lets down. I highly recommend "Einstein" and give tribute to Walter Isaacson, whose research and strength as an author gives us such a compelling look at Albert Einstein.

Frank Rich, one of America's premier writers, has offered a blow-by-blow account of the Bush administration's selling of the Iraq war (and just about everything else) to the American people. Bush, lightweight from the beginning, had promised to surround himself with the best team possible, if elected in 2000. His selection as president and his subsequent "dream team" have proven to be a sham and Rich deftly peels away the layers, exposing the hypocrisy and the lies of the administration. Madison Avenue tried, but could not quite save Bush, as he strutted from one crisis to another... Rich should have another book in mind to finish things off in 2009."The Greatest Story Ever Sold" is a walk down recent Memory Lane and this is not the Wysteria Lane of ABC fame. It is a sad and rude awakening of what can go wrong when the reasons for going to war are based on falsehoods and Rich covers this aspect wonderfully. What triggered my own memory were the unfolding events in that late summer of 2002 when the Bush people were beginning to try to tie Saddam with WMD, Al-Qaeda and a host of other things. Incredulous as we were then, it has taken the country years to arrive at basically the same conclusion that the author and so many of us picked up on at the time... Bush was largely making it up as he went along and the "packaging" was needed to justify the administration's casus belli. If the war in Iraq began the collapse of cards, Rich points out, Hurricane Katrina completed the downward fall.Rich's scathing epilogue cuts to the chase. It could also have been a terrific prologue and I would encourage readers to take this in first and then go back and read the rest of the book. The timelines which follow the epilogue are masterfully set up in two columns... one chronicles "the story that was sold by the Bush administration..." and the other reveals "what the administration was learning behind the scenes.....and NOT telling the public". It's a fitting end to an ongoing story.What makes "The Greatest Story Ever Sold" stand out is the narrative. Rich keeps the pace flowing evenly but with a sense of urgency that keeps the reader wanting more. He reminds us of what else was going in the country at each historical marker and his sense of drama (Rich, himself, a former drama critic) is never overplayed and without parallel. I highly recommend this book as a well-researched look into the makings and undoings of the worst president ever.

For those of us who place Martha Stewart somewhere between Leona Helmsley and Cruella de Vil, this book is for you! Hey, it's a great and easy summer read and the author, Christopher Byron makes no excuses for his bias. Some supporters of Martha's may tend to look at this book as a hatchet job on America's most famous businesswoman, but Byron actually compliments her from time to time on her rise through the corporate world. The problem, it seems, is that Martha Stewart continues to create her own woes. The author simply points them out. And he would have a field day with the recent hole into which she has put herself....namely insider trading.Martha Stewart may be a cunning and savvy figure dressed up in an apron for public viewing, but my sympathies do not extend to her. Funny how she has gotten into so much hot water in her professional life, but I guess the irony is this....boiling water is the first thing one learns in cooking!

John Dean's new book, "Conservatives Without Conscience" is a concise, tightly-wrapped work that portrays the (mostly) male-dominated world of right wing politicos as a segment of the population that is concerned with authoritarian rule and is bereft of morals and ethics. From the holier-than-thou Pat Robertson to the cat-killing Bill Frist, the author goes after conservative "thinking" (if one can call it that) and points out the evolutionary process of the transformation of government from the conscience-oriented conservatives of the 1950s to the bullies of today. It's Ann Coulter in reverse, but with teeth and not fangs.One of Dean's main thrusts is how the conservatives of today lack any sense of their own (in)abilities to see the world clearly. To the extent that they view the world in black-and-white terms is nothing new (just look at Bush and Iraq for a reminder) but the bubble in which they live is truly remarkable....and scary. Having been central to Watergate, the author's assessments cannot be overlooked.Fortunately, "Conservatives Without Conscience" is a book that gathers steam and after a questionable start it roars ahead. The problem with the beginning of the book is that there is simply too much John Dean. The lengthy preface (a modified, literary raison d'etre) is largely unnecessary and unconnected with the main body of the work, although the references to Barry Goldwater are certainly worth the exposure. That said, Dean commences with an enlightened look at the mind of a conservative. After all, he was one once and his newer, more modified persona is something that a large number of Americans have come to adopt for themselves. For many in the Republican party, the party went south, turned right, found religion and left them stranded."Conservatives Without Conscience" is surely worth the read. While politics is cyclical, John Dean reminds us that this crowd may be hard to get rid of....and that's the scariest thought of them all.

"Little Chapel on the River", a delightful book by Gwendolyn Bounds, is a story of three families....the Guinans, who run the local pub and store, the extended Guinan family (patrons, mostly) of Garrison, New York and the family of the author, herself. It's a "feel good" book in the best possible sense.Having been displaced by the attacks on 9/11, Wendy and her girlfriend, Kathryn, are introduced to the tiny hamlet of Garrison just across the river from West Point. Within a short time, Wendy has begun to make friends at Guinan's and ends up being a part of the entourage that makes its way into Guinan's each morning and evening. Along the way, the author finds more than a few things about herself as she begins to piece together what's missing from her life.Bounds is enticingly descriptive about the characters she meets at Guinan's. Some, naturally, are small town skeptics regarding this new face in the crowd but without giving much more than an inch, Wendy finds herself enmeshed in their lives as they become her new friends, far from the roaring din of Manhattan. There's Fitz, a former U.S. federal marshal and Vietnam war veteran who likes to butt heads with Dan Donnelly, the "limousine liberal" lawyer. Jane and Mary Ellen form a duo of town females who help out at the pub and enjoy Guinan's to the fullest. Their loyalty is never questioned. The list of patrons goes on. The real story, though, centers around the Guinan family....Jim, an emigr&eacute; from Ireland and his four children. This is indeed a family that despite its ups and downs is a close-knit unit that takes care of its own...and while they're doing so, take care of everyone else, too. Having been drawn into the life of a small, warm place, Wendy, Kathryn and their "bonus puppy", Dolly, decide to make Garrison their home. Even Governor George Pataki has a cameo role in this book.The author keeps a good pace throughout and one gets a terrific insider's view of life at Guinan's. To say "Little Chapel on the River" has a happy ending does not in any way betray or diminish Bounds's writing. Rather it enhances it, I suspect, because goodness begets goodness and there's plenty of it here. One hint that might help the reader enjoy the book even more... most of the "action" takes place in the hours of darkness, so reading this book at night gives it more meaning and consequence.I applaud Gwendolyn Bounds and her "Little Chapel on the River". Guinan's is a place that time has not so much passed by, but preserved. The author has done a magnificent job in relating the tales that go on in this little place on the Hudson.

John Tayman's new book, "The Colony", is thorough and brilliant and offers a behind-the-scenes look at one of America's tragedies....the exile and continued misunderstanding about leprosy and the people who were forced into quarantine....most for life. It is an ongoing story (directly) for the lives of a few, yet the memories will linger for those who are associated in its shame for years to come. Tayman tells all of this with depth and compassion.A dozen men and women were first exiled in 1866 and many were to follow shortly thereafter. The colony reached the height of its population just before 1900 when, at that time, over one thousand people inhabited the buildings that had become their "home away from home". Many people know about Father Damien and his overall contributions but Tayman gives a robust and clear picture of this Belgian priest who would later achieve sainthood. With unusual zeal and energy, Father Damien was the centerpiece of the Molokai settlement from his arrival in 1873 until his untimely death in 1889. The conditions in the early years were extraordinarily bad.....little food, fuel and adequate shelter led to miserable lives even beyond those with leprosy. One of the more surprising details uncovered in this part of the book was the misdiagnosis of the disease.....many people in the colony never had leprosy from the beginning.Central to much of the book are the continual disputes between the Honolulu-based board, which technically oversaw things on Molokai, and the managers who actually tried to run things. There is a long list of characters presented here and good and evil are certainly in evidence. After Father Damien's death conditions did gradually improve, but to the extent that this colony ever should have existed is a scathing indictment of the fear factor that existed for decades. Tayman's short but informative few pages on what leprosy really is (in medical terms) is a welcome addition to the reader's understanding of the disease.This is a story unlike many others and John Tayman has given us quite a book....a narrative that flows, terrific detail and a compassion for those who lived there. I highly recommend it.

Graham Jackson's book, &quot;The Living Room Mysteries&quot; was recommended to me by a friend who is a Jungian therapist. Having spent a couple of years exploring my own dreams it was good to look at a new concept of male relationships. I must admit that I haven't read Jackson's prelude book, &quot;The Secret Lore of Gardening&quot; but I nonetheless found some things from which to take from his second book. Placing men on axes of blue-red and green-yellow, Jackson proceeds to describe what a &quot;typical&quot; male resembles when primarily attached to one color. In this book, he gives over to the red-blue axis.&quot;The Living Room Mysteries&quot; requires patience to get through. A good deal of information is revealed in-depth and it gets a little tiresome on occasion. It is a book that one can put down for a while, but it's also worth coming back to again. I'm sure most readers try to identify themselves with one or more colors as I did. Jackson's conclusions seem to be the best part of his work....namely that while we may be primarily associated with one color we probably have a little of everything in us and those colors can change over time.By the way, I think I'm basically red with some blue thrown in for balance.

It's easy to see why Jon Stewart has emerged as America's most consistent humorous talent.....his new book, "America" (The Book) is a wonderfully witty extension of "The Daily Show". He and his writers have spared no one and it is laugh-out-loud funny. From an early chapter (where Stewart tells what really happened on the ride of Paul Revere) through his discourse on the branches of American government to what lies beyond the coming election, Jon Stewart has created a book that is a remarkable poke at ourselves. It actually is designed to look like a school textbook, with colorful photos and graphics, throughout. It's as pleasing to the eye as it is to our collective funnybone.At a stage in our history when America seems to be more divided than ever, "America" (The Book) has arrived in due fashion and with terrific timeliness. I hope people of all political persuasions read it as Jon Stewart has taken America down a slightly different road from the road of facts and figures from America history we learned in school. He's given us an opus of laughs!

Having been in countless productions of "Noye's Fludde" over a forty-year period, it was good to hear an original recording of it from Orford Church in 1961. This is a short opus of Britten, but one that is expertly composed. Every note works in the piece and Britten's use of percussion instruments, especially, is wonderful. Given the fact that this recording is from a live performance only adds to the enjoyment. It's a terrific CD.

Niccolo Ammaniti's "new" book, "I'll Steal You Away" is a melange of small but very passionate vignettes concerning a cross section of people in Ischiano Scalo, an Italian Peyton Place. His protagonists are one Pietro Moroni, an uncertain pre-teen who carries the responsibility of the world on his shoulders and Graziano Biglia, a forty-something ne'er-do-well. Their lives are largely connected with Flora Palmieri, a local school teacher on whom Pietro seeks revenge for failing him at school and with whom Graziano has a whirlwind courtship lasting one night.I'll Steal You Away" is "new" in the sense that it was written before his wonderful 2003 book, "I'm Not Scared" (after which a gratifying movie was made) and translated by Jonathan Hunt (no relation to me) earlier this year. Ammaniti's attention to detail and his often graphic descriptions of characters in sensual scenes are in abundance in "I'll Steal You Away". He knows how to tell a story. However, this earlier book suffers from being too long where "I'm Not Scared" was of an apt length. While one of the aims of the book is to transfer a sense of worth and power to Pietro from Graziano during an encounter where the youngster is being attacked by his peers and Graziano comes to Pietro's aid, it nonetheless takes almost the entire length of the book to get to that point.Hunt's very British translation makes for a fun sidelight (at least for American readers!) but Ammaniti shines in the force of his narrative delivery. It's a good book but some editing would have made "I'll Steal You Away" an even better one.

Paul O'Neill has scored a knockout punch to the Bush administration with this candid assessment of his nearly two years as Secretary of the Treasury. He confirms what many of us have long suspected...this White House crowd is secretive, manipulative and out of touch.The controlling nature of the Bush administration didn't then and I'm sure doesn't now allow free-thinkers like O'Neill. It mattered not that the secretary had a proven track record of accomplishment in the business world and a lifetime of experience working in government. The picture he paints is staggering and the results to which he steers us offer a grim future for the state of the economy and the style by which things operate at the White House.O'Neill often compares the current administration to two others that he had worked for previously....Nixon and Ford. High marks are given to each and O'Neill just shakes his head at the lack of interest and level of intelligence exhibited by George W. Bush. The fact that so many cabinet meetings were "scripted" adds another dimension to a White House that seems rife with sycophants.The service that Paul O'Neill has done in giving us this wonderful book is that it will be an eye-opener and a reinforcement to many. Prying open the door to get a peek inside the Oval Office means that the silence from within is no longer so hushed. O'Neill sheds light on a group of people who tend to march in lockstep and who view the world in terms of black and white. Thank you, Paul O'Neill!

The story behind &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; is as emotionally moving as the song it produced and Lynn Sherr has captured all of this in her timely new book. I read it this evening and found myself on more than one occasion needing to go to my piano and play and sing through this wonderful national song.Many facts leap out at the reader...the poet and author of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, Katharine Lee Bates, never met the composer, Samuel A. Ward, and except for one $5 fee, neither received any money for it...Mr. Ward died before the tune and text ever appeared together in print...and that dozens of other tunes were proposed to be wedded to Miss Bates's poem yet it wasn't until shortly before her death in 1929 that tune and text became the accepted national version that we sing today.There are many more rich details to this story and Ms. Sherr has put them forward with colorful prints throughout the book, many of them reminders of the times in which these two gifted people lived. Fate certainly played several pivotal parts. The biggest was Miss Bates's trip west in the summer of 1893 where she was inspired in at least three places to pen lines that exist in the song today... &quot;alabaster cities&quot; (from seeing the &quot;White City&quot; of the Chicago World's Fair), &quot;amber waves of grain&quot; (while passing through Kansas on a train) and &quot;spacious skies&quot;, &quot;purple mountain majesties&quot; and &quot;above the fruited plain&quot; from her view atop Pikes' Peak. But we also learn that it is quite plausible that Samuel Ward wrote the tune on a friend's linen cuff as he left Coney Island one day aboard a boat. And if it hadn't been for a conscientious clergyman from Rochester New York, the words and music might never have been paired. I'm glad that a few other musical attempts that tried to be tied with the poem are printed in this book...play through them and you'll see why Mr. Ward's music is clearly superior.After the story itself is finished, Ms. Sherr goes on to give her thoughts on the meaning of the song and the fight to get it established as our National Anthem to replace the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. This point has been fought over for a long time and will continue to be. For those of us who much prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; it is reassuring to know that in almost every gathering I have attended since September 11 where music has been sung, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; is one people request. It's no wonder. This great song reflects on the America in which we live, hope and dream. Lynn Sherr has done a magnificent job.

Early in her alarmingly funny new book, "Assassination Vacation", Sarah Vowell makes reference to the recently revived Stephen Sondheim musical, "Assassins". Having seen the musical last summer and now, having read her book, "Assassination Vacation" is clearly the better of the two.Sarah Vowell is a combination of Christopher Columbus and Sherlock Holmes. With the deftness of discovery and of unearthing the most mundane things presidential, she sets out on a journey of hilarious proportion....and along the way enchants the reader with her wit and narrative style. This funky, spunky, spelunker of assassination treasure, Ms. Vowell spares no detail. From discovering the skull of Lincoln assassination collaborator, Lewis Powell, to her seasick ride to Fort Jefferson to view co-conspirator Dr. Samuel Mudd's jail cell, to upstate New York, where she finds about the (non)-sexual practices of Garfield assassin Charles Guiteau, the author is a whirlwind of morbid intrigue. She leaves no stone (or plaque) unturned and the result is a cheerful and very informative romp through assassination history.The wonderful thing about Sarah Vowell's book is that she loves what she is doing, regardless of what other people might think of her eerie attraction to death by pistol. Yet she contributes to the overall landscape in ways that are educational. I've always wondered what ever happened to the train station where Garfield was shot and that after Leon Czolgosz fired fatal bullets into William McKinley through a bandaged hand that the bandage caught on fire! You don't get these gems in your average textbook.Thank you, Sarah Vowell, for "Assassination Vacation". Is there a natural segue to this book? I don't know, but l'd like to see where the author goes next!

I have not read &quot;The Hungry Ocean&quot; so without having another of Linda Greenlaw's books with which to compare &quot;The Lobster Chronicles&quot;, I nonetheless thought this a worthy effort. Ms. Greenlaw writes with a breezy style, punctuated with anecdotes about her neighbors and family. Her language is often as colorful as the people around her. I was a little bothered by her predictable style of humor. It's funny in the beginning but wears a little thin by the end.A short promo appearing on the dustjacket written by Sebastian Junger describes Ms. Greenlaw's book (in part) as &quot;the best book, period I've ever read on fishing&quot;. The author writes some about lobster fishing but her book is really about her family and friends....and, of course, about her. I would have liked to have heard more from her about lobstering but I'm happy with this good summer read.

Chicago is certainly well known for the fire of 1871 but how many people have ever heard of the fire which swept through the Iroquois Theatre thirty-two years later, leaving six hundred people dead in its wake? I admit that I never had heard about it so with Nat Brandt's excellent new book, "Chicago Death Trap", the lives of those lost and the hundreds of families that the tragedy touched can now be told.The author is direct and writes in a sparse, conservative tone that works well. Within the covers of this small book, Brandt, after some good preparation about the Iroquois Theatre itself and the men behind it, spells out the details of the fire....how it started, how it spread, how it affected the cast and stagehands, (the performers were giving a presentation of the comedy, "Mr. Bluebeard", starring Eddie Foy, Sr.) and finally how people in a sudden and severe panic tried to saved themselves. This is not an easy book to read but I give the author credit....it is also not an easy book to put down. Brandt gives human faces to those who escaped and those who did not. He tells of incredible rescues and how the city responded moments after the fire started and days and weeks after the finger of blame began to point in all directions. He describes makeshift morgues and those who came to identify loved ones...if they could at all. He recounts the ramifications faced by officials and the theatre owners after the tragedy. The horrors are so individualized...down to the items of clothing and personal items worn by those in the theatre that afternoon.It is perhaps toward the very end of this book that Nat Brandt makes his most poignant point... that other than a cemetery monument and a City Hall bas-relief nothing else exists in commemoration of the Iroquois fire. The memory of the fire seems to have passed as quickly as the fire itself. Thanks to this book, we have a chance to learn about this horrible day in Chicago's history.

With most gardeners there is a fine line between heartwarming and heartbreaking. William Alexander's, "The $64 Tomato", is a tale told very much of the latter. Heartbreaking as it is at least the author, over a decade, gives the garden his best shot... and THEN some to a healthy degree.Much of "The $64 Tomato" could be subtitled, "The Decline and Fall of a Hudson River Valley Harvester" ("harvester" being a term Alexander gradually comes to call himself) for there is so much woe in this story as to give the reader pause as to why he stuck with things so long. The beginning of the book is breezier than some of the last chapters but I found myself liking parts of it that I hadn't expected and not being as satisfied regarding the parts for which I initially bought the book. Alexander is best when he is serious....he gives good detail about the planting and care of apple trees, problem solving about insect infestations and a general approach to gardening as an attraction. Although some of his writing shines, his attempts at humor don't quite match his educational side. The title of the book aside, the reader intuits from the start that this is going to be a book about a failed attempt with mother nature and it certainly is.For those of us who have spent time doing this kind of work (and for those of us who have also failed) William Alexander hits some chords of recognition. Gardening, as he points out, is tough going and relentless...the rewards are there but at what cost? Thankfully, he tells us exactly what his costs were and that penultimate chapter is one of his most revealing.

"Send", the new book providing "dos", "dont's" and other rules of etiqutte online, is a short book, but comprehensive to the degree that so many areas of emailing are covered. Much of what is written here may not be followed as we do indeed tend to dash off emails at a precipitous rate sometimes, but the the wisdom of the authors is appreciated.There is some good advice especially about sending angry emails, as most of us have at one time or another, but "Send" also provides reminders about content, CCs and BCCs, when to send an email and when not to, etc. A good deal of this is second nature but the book works as a welcome reference. For those of us who don't work in an office or with other people, there is a fair amount about office etiquette, so some readers may want to skip those sections, but the narrative is crisp and "Send" is a solid and often fun read.

If there was ever a book that conveyed the color of the Civil War, short of a television documentary, "Generals in Bronze" is it. This is a remarkable book not only for the life sketches and interviews made by artist James E. Kelly but also for the superb editing of William Styple.Kelly, a native New Yorker, was born a scant few years before the onset of the Civil War and although he began as a sketch artist, his works are more remembered now for his statues and bronze reliefs. While Styple astutely begins his book with Kelly's observations of General Philip Sheridan in 1878 and ends with a couple of 1920's recollections of eyewitnesses to Lincoln's assassination, "Generals in Bronze" is largely concerned with reflections from the second tier of Union generals....their remembrances for sure, but also their comments about other generals and, of course, their egos. Kelly, with a discerning eye not only as an artist but with an eye to the future has a rather cheeky and self-promoting way of working his way into his subects' confidences. He captures more of these generals than they could ever have captured the enemy on the battlefield.That so many generals lived so long after the Civil War and that Kelly, perhaps more than anyone else, was able to relate their collective histories makes him a center point for postwar interest. One of the wonderful things about "Generals in Bronze" is the language itself. How formal it was that people spoke just a mere hundred years ago, or so! Yet with this formality comes a certain humor, freedom and admiration one often finds lacking in today's jargon.William Styple, through giving us the words of James Kelly and his quotes and assessments on the generals with whom he spoke, has done a great service. I can't recommend this book more highly. It is a serious and unforgettable read.

All one ever needs or wants to know about Keanu Reeves, one of Hollywood's most intriguing actors, can be found in this book by Brian J. Robb. Originally published in 1997, it was updated two years ago and contains a section on "The Matrix" as well as entailing his (then) upcoming movies such as "Thumbsucker", a newly-released film I saw recently.Keanu is "sui generis". There is no other actor quite like him and I mean that in a good way. Like other actors he's had his moments of triumph and suffered from films that didn't do well, but Keanu seems to emerge from all of this stronger and with a larger range of roles each time. There have always been critics who find Keanu less than convincing as an actor, but in the many films in which I've seen him, Keanu is always compelling and often displays real talent. (If I had to pick a favorite, I most liked Keanu in "Speed")It's hard to imagine a biography about someone who is just in his early forties, but author Robb has combed his subject's life and found much to relate. Besides the complete list of Keanu's films, about which Robb goes into great detail, the actor's life apart from the screen is covered as well. It is a good thing to know that most of the actors and actresses who have worked with Keanu find him to be a very nice guy who tends to prefer a quieter life off-camera...that is, when he's not bike riding or performing with his band, Dogstar.This book is replete with photographs which make a wonderful addition. The writing is crisp and although Robb's book is largely informational, he steers clear of a "kiss and tell" biography. For those of us who enjoy Keanu Reeves, I highly recommend this book.

George Packer's new book, "The Assassins' Gate: America in Iraq", is the finest account of what has gone on in Iraq since the American invasion in March, 2003. So much that we don't hear or read about is contained in this book, from the executive mismanagement in Washington to the devastating day-to-day life in Baghdad. "The Assassins' Gate" packs a wallop.It's hard to pin the blame, as the author suggests, on any one individual in the United States government as to why things have gone so bad in Iraq over the past two years because this Bush White House (being "unto itself") never grasped anything more appropriate than grand and glorious ideas that wafted from place to place and changed meaning whenever the White House needed them to do so. Consequently, Iraqis (with whom Packer first spoke with in 2003) have far different and increasingly dubious views today of the American occupation of their homeland.Packer has travelled extensively throughout Iraq on his visits and adds a couple of solid chapters that don't include Baghdad....one on Kirkuk and one on Basra. He reminds us that the war over there is a nationwide concern and different parts of the country react differently to the events which occur. What makes "The Assassins' Gate" so powerful is that Packer looks at every side of an issue and presents us with stories from not only Iraqi citizens (the most compelling parts of the book) but also pages dealing with Captain John Prior, a proud American serving his country, and Chris Frosheiser, whose son's death left him examining all parts of what this war means. Prior's and Frosheiser's testimonials bring a far distant war home.There are a few quotes which struck me while reading "The Assassins' Gate". In referring to the insurgency, Packer writes, "Bush's response to the initial stage of the insurgency had been to say, 'Bring 'em on'. Officials in Baghdad called this kind of long-range tinkering 'the eight-thousand-mile screwdriver,' and at the other end was a president who often said that the lesson of Vietnam was that politicians shouldn't try to do the job of generals." In describing the right vs. left attitude of debate in the United States, Packer notes, "in this country, Iraq was almost always about winning the argument." Finally, a simple but chilling quote....."the weakest idea in Iraq was the idea of Iraq itself".Summarizing "The Assassins' Gate" is not an easy task because of the complexities of the war and its handlers, but the core of this fair-minded book seems to be this: the men and women in Washington who planned this war saw it as black and white....go in, take out Saddam, put an Iraqi government in place and get out. Would that it have been so easy. George Packer reminds us that the war in Iraq is about a whole spectrum of color....shades of this and that as told by dozens of people involved in just as many facets of a war as there can be. I highly recommend "The Assassins' Gate" and hope that George Packer will follow up with another book in a couple of years. Undoubtedly, the United States will still be in Iraq.

I have to admit that although I've heard about Garrison Keillor for years I must be one of the few Americans who has never tuned into "Prairie Home Companion" so his new book, "Homegrown Democrat" was a first introduction to this gifted American. Keillor writes with wit and grace and saves his criticism for George W. Bush and the Republican party and to that end I found myself nodding in agreement.Although I grew up in a Republican town, (and, unfortunately, the hometown of the Bush family) Keillor's yearning for old-fashioned values strikes me as not unnecessarily nostalgic and reminds me of what is missing in today's America....people helping each other. He cites St. Paul, Minnesota as exactly the type of town in which one would want to live.As a writer, Garrison Keillor contributes much to the current political dialogue. This book tends to drift a bit too much....I wish there had been a little more of a unifying thread to it. Yet he hits all the right buttons and I'm glad he included a segment about why the vast majority of people in the arts are Democrats. No contest, there.Garrison Keillor makes two points convincingly. The first (and I am in this camp) is why so many Democrats have remained loyal to the party as we've watched the Republican party move south, move way to the right and "find" religion. The second point lies with what has happened to so many Republicans in my part of the country.....they grew up as Republicans but don't see themselves anywhere near this new right-wing grip of their former party. Their response was to become Democrats. Thank you, Mr. Keillor for this book. And yes, Democrats do understand the real meaning of patriotism.

Bill Moyers will someday be remembered for a good many things in his rewarding life but for me he will be remembered for one thing more than anything else....his being America's most thoughtful journalist. "Moyers on America" is as much captivating as it is provocative and I hope he will be around for many years to come, tendering his wisdom and experience on issues ranging from public television to the Bible.Never shy about stating his opinions or challenging us to thought, the author reliably comes down hard on the Bush administration, corporate greed and media conglomerates that rule the roost. Much like Tom Fenton in his book, "Bad News", Moyers expresses his concern about news and where it's headed. He comments on the fact that "real" news has morphed into entertainment and he offers remedies for the sorry state of news today. In his defense of public television, he tells us why public tv is important and he does so through the lens of his own career. Through it all, Moyers educates not with a heavy hand of diatribe but with an enlightened pen and a good dose of humor."Moyers on America" lacks the thread of a cohesive narrative but the book is designed that way...it is a collection of his past contributions from being a witness to history in so many ways over so many years. I think I enjoyed the last section of his book the best. It includes chapters on his years as press secretary to Lyndon Johnson, his long friendship with Bill Crook and his insights into growing older. For me, "Moyers on America" hits a wonderful nerve. I urge those readers to read it slowly and take in the fresh air he offers.

"The Great Divide: Retro vs. Metro America" by John Sperling and company is not so much a book but an extensive and multi-layered study about the divisions that exist in America. While the author is upfront about his political leanings from the outset, he and his co-authors have put together a fine assessment about what's happening to this country from within.This book takes time to digest and should be read carefully as there is much to be absorbed. If you want a straight out compelling narrative, this is not the book for you. However, the author dissects the major aspects of American life, both economically and culturally with vigor and directness.Sperling's arguments about Retro vs. Metro with regard to science and religion make the most sense. That the United States should be headed by a president whose main supporters are fundamendalist and born-again Christians is both appaling on its surface and ominous for the future. Losing our competitive technological edge to China and others seems likely in the twenty-first century and the thrust of the religious right to have Biblical dogma be the guide should unnerve every thinking American."The Great Divide" bogs down in the middle when Sperling gets into economic matters, especially regarding energy and agriculture. It's not that he doesn't exhibit his points well.... it just seems as if it's a classroom lecture gone on a bit too long.In the end, however, the major political point is made firmly...that Metro America had better develop a metro political strategy to compete with Retro America. After all, if approximately two-thirds of Americans live in Metro states we need to do a better job in order to re-establish our political advantage.Laura Bush recently blamed the media for the divisions in the United States. That's a simplistic answer to a complex and growing detachment of Americans from one another on both economic and cultural levels. John Sperling has given us plenty of food for thought. One may not agree with all of his conclusions but he's on the right track. I wish this country was, too.

Whoa! After reading Anthony Bourdain's striking book "Kitchen Confidential" you may never want to dine out again. I may just know a little too much for my own good about what goes on behind semi-closed doors at restaurants around the country. It has been said that the two things one should never see being made are sausage and laws....I might add a third...what goes on in the kitchen.However, after finishing Bourdain's book, I want to eat out more. He presents in glib, and often funny fashion, the many aspects that surround preparing meals for customers...and he doesn't stop at the kitchen door.....the reader is treated to news about suppliers, owners, competition with other restaurants for staff, etc. He's certainly more than earned his stripes and it's fascinating to see the road he has taken to get there. His basic ingredient in everything is his love of food and its preparation. But watch out along the way. He has some pretty harsh things to say (and many good things, too) about people with whom and for whom he's worked.Bourdain spends more than a little too much time on people who go into this business and who tend to live often on the edges of society...alcoholics and drug addicts to name just a couple. One wonders how meals are ever prepared when some (or many!)of the kitchen staff are high or drunk. But he also commends the same people for their loyalty and often for their creativity. I particularly liked that aspect of this book.Kitchen Confidential but kitchen confidence? Yes. But fasten your seat belts....this book is a roller coaster ride!

Julia Child's recent death prompted me to read this biography of her written in 1997. I'm glad I did but it took a monumental effort to get through it.Noel Riley Fitch has given us as comprehensive a look into the life of the wonderful Julia Child as an author ever could with a subject. The reader knows more about the interaction of the cadre of people that filled Julia Child's life than one could ever imagine. Therein, however, lies the problem. This book is more an expanded diary than it is a readable and useful offering.One can't possibly keep up with the dozens of names bandied about and the end result is an olio of confusion. What bothers me most about this biography is that it reflects not much warmth of Julia Child, herself. There are some funny paragraphs (especially those describing what her voice sounds like) but this book is as dry as a Thanksgiving turkey without the gravy. I do, however give Ms. Fitch credit on one important account....she wonderfully relates the marriage of Paul and Julia Child.... a marriage of partnership and deep love. I only wish that the rest of the book could have been written so lovingly.

Michael D'Antonio's new book, &quot;The Boys State Rebellion&quot; is a look into the troubled life of an institution and the repercussions it had on American Society. The lives of those who were subjected to this kind of life have been immeasurably altered and most for no good reason.The book centers around the Fernald home in Massachusetts largely in the 1950s. Although girls resided at the home D'Antonio tells much more through the eyes of the boys, most notably Fred Boyce. Placed in Fernald for many different reasons these boys were labeled &quot;morons&quot; when most of them clearly had abilities far and above their designation. The filth and squalor in which they lived was often accompanied by physical and verbal abuse that led to an uprising in November, 1957 for which the book has been named.While the author's writing is a little wooden, he nonetheless conveys the state of life at Fernald and goes on to tell of what happened to many of these boys as they grew into adulthood. That any of them survived the horrors of Fernald is miraculous and a great testament to the courage and mettle that they exhibited.

Dr. William S. Pollack has done a masterful job in constructing a book which allows us to hear boys' testimonies on well over a dozen topics....their accounts tell us about pressures which stare boys straight in the eye every day and demand their responses. In &quot;Real Boys' Voices&quot; we see the flip side of the often uncommunicative teenage boy and Pollack helps us to see how boys regard themselves (and others) when asked to express their thoughts freely and candidly. As a private one-to-one teacher, I agree with, and have acted upon for many years, his main theme....that boys need a shame-free, comfort-free zone in which to open up. The remarkable entries in this book are sometimes very troubling, often warm, and always genuine. I would suggest that one read Pollack's book slowly and carefully. The emotional depth conveyed is well worth the time. The last chapter offers sound advice in content and tone on how to deal with boys, recapping the advice he peppers throughout the book. My hope is that it should be read especially by men who continue to propagate the &quot;Boy Code&quot;....a code that keeps boys' true feelings stifled and their lives wrapped up in straitjackets.

One of the most engrossing books about American food to be published over the past few years was Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation", (2001) a serious, provocative and often very funny book about the dangers of eating fast food. This latest offering by Schlosser, "Chew On This", is a disappointment in almost every way.Much of what is contained in "Chew on This" has either been covered in his previous book or presents facts most people either know or can guess. The prose has an amateurish quality and seems to be written for children to read. His hard-luck cases (the girl who works long hours at a McDonald's in West Virginia or the Illinois boy who had gastric bypass surgery) are depressing without being particularly empathetic.Schlosser writes his best when he describes conditions at slaughterhouses...the book picks up a little here. It is also encouraging to be reminded just how much power McDonald's has as a corporation.....from advertising to wage pay to just about everything they are involved in, the company has the most world clout when it comes to food.Schlosser's message again is "don't eat at fast food restaurants....you'll get fat and your health will deteriorate". This much we learned from "Fast Food Nation" (if we didn't already know it ourselves) so my question is "what is the purpose of this book?" I'd recommend the reader get Schlosser's previous book to get a much more comprehensive view of how the fast food industry works and skip this one. I thank the author, however, for one new tidbit in "Chew On This"....because of what the food coloring is made from I won't be eating Dannon strawberry yogurt or drinking Ocean Spray pink grapefruit juice drink anytime soon!

After reading David Kuo's "Tempting Faith" one gets a number of impressions...he's sincere and young, to name just a couple. The premise of the book, exposing those in the Christian community and their influence in White House politics and policy is nicely exposed by Kuo, but my feeling is that he stayed just long enough to write a book. He's a couple of beers short of a six-pack as a writer, though I like his argument.There have been many books more critical of Bush and company over the past few months, but this is not particularly one of them. "Tempting Faith" takes a long time to get into. The Bushies have plenty to answer for and David Kuo has done a good job....I wish this book had been less self-serving and more revealing.

For those of us who grew up with Johnny Carson it's hard to believe that it has been fifteen years since Johnny last came out from behind "The Tonight Show" curtain and even harder to accept the fact that he is no longer with us. But we're in luck in one way....this wonderful book, compiled by Stephen Cox, brings Johnny back to life in the most comprehensive and nostalgic way. It's a walk down Memory Lane and it is nothing short of wonderful.From the inception of "The Tonight Show" and its early years before Johnny, Cox takes us through every segment of the thirty-year run we all enjoyed. There are comedians, of course, memorable moments, the monologue and my favorite...Joan Embery and her wildlife companions from the San Diego Zoo. Who of my generation can forget the wedding of Tiny Tim and "Miss Vicki" or the Ed Ames tomahawk throw? (the latter being a perennial favorite of the Carson annual retrospectives)What is such an added bonus to the book are the dozens of photos that grace its pages. "Here's Johnny!" is a terrific look back at a man who made the nation laugh for three decades and who will always be remembered as the best at what he did. Thank you, Johnny!

Annie Proulx's "Brokeback Mountain" is a gem of a short story reminding us of the days when, not so long ago, if two men "got together" it could end in death for one or both of them should anyone find out. Set in Wyoming mostly in 1963, "Brokeback Mountain" tells simply of Ennis and Jack, two cowboys who not only have a desire for each other but a lifelong need for each other.The intimate scenes that take place in "Brokeback Mountain" are clearly described but not lengthy. The tension derived from this story has less to do with Ennis and Jack's intimacy than it does with their being apart. Add a couple of wives to the tale, and you've got a recipe for stress. Proulx takes it as far as Jack's death and the wonderful depiction of Ennis trying to catch a scent from the deceased Jack's shirt, only to find out that all that is left is a memory."Brokeback Mountain" is wistful but just emotional enough to win over readers. It's a quick story but much is packed into its few pages and I recommend it.

"Breach of Faith", Jed Horne's breathtaking account of Hurricane Katrina, not only relates the story of this great disaster as we have come to know it, but goes well beyond that...Horne peels away the layers to give readers an inside look at the storm, the affected population, the politicians, the scientists and much more. The scope of this book is immense but what makes "Breach of Faith" such a wonder is the narrative itself. Horne is a born writer and it shows on every page.There are heroes and villains in "Breach of Faith" and Horne is particularly willing to include Mayor Ray Nagin in the latter category. FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers get their collective comeuppance as playing major roles in the disaster...FEMA for its almost non-existent help after the hurricane and the Army Corps for allowing major errors to occur in the building of the levees, themselves. The levees, by the way, are of chief concern in "Breach of Faith" and Horne masterfully instructs the reader on how and why they failed. Aside from the personal chronicles mentioned before, this is the most fascinating part of the book. It is where the author really shines as a writer and teacher. I highly recommend "Breach of Faith"... it is told with great care and insight.

Wow. I read reviews of this powerful book but after finishing it, I was still bowled over. David Maraniss has captured the life and times of Roberto Clemente far better than one could have imagined. Baseball biographies abound, but this is the best.For those of us who grew up watching Roberto Clemente play ball, author Maraniss strikes just the right chord. He is directly focused on Clemente...but he also reminds us of the era in which Clemente performed. Clemente arrived in the major leagues in 1955 at a time when segregation existed in the south but segregation of a different sort in baseball. Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier earlier (with the help of Branch Rickey) but Roberto Clemente was in a kind of middle generation...able to play in the big leagues but separated when it came to travel. Maraniss deftly points out the conundrum...coming from Puerto Rico where racism was unheard of, Clemente's experience of the prejudice of the south affected not only him, but other Latin players as well. Maraniss also tells of "white" Puerto Ricans and "black" Puerto Ricans and how baseball in this country treated them differently. Just think of how the Yankees' Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada might have seen things in another fashion had they come up through the ranks when Roberto Clemente did. This is a book about the social progress of baseball as seen through the eyes of one of its greatest hitters. As Maraniss points out, the difference between 1960 (the first year that Clemente was on a World Series winning team) and 1971 (the last year he also starred in post-season play) is phenomenal.David Maraniss combines the gift of research with a superb narrative. Not only does he tell of Clemente's passionate side... at once both thin-skinned and courageous... but the role model that Clemente played for so many. His delicate recounting of the plane crash which ultimately took Clemente's life is handled with tenderness and respect.Roberto Clemente was an exciting player to watch and I'm glad I'm old enough to have seen him in action. David Maraniss has given us a look at this magnificent baseball player as he should be remembered...a man who elevated the excitement of baseball and a humanitarian who died trying to help others. I highly recommend this extraordinary biography.

I purchased this book when it was first published over a dozen years ago and still refer to it several times a week. Not only is it comprehensive but Tim Brooks often gives short biographies of the stars, listing other shows and related areas for which a particular actor or actress might have been known. I'm sorry that it is currently out of print because I would like to have an updated version of the book.

Ian Bostridge has emerged as the finest tenor of a generation. This CD, one of the best solo CDs I have heard, is remarkable not only for Mr. Bostridge's incredible musicianship, but also for its remarkable song content. His performance of William Denis Browne's &quot;To Gratiana Dancing and Singing&quot; is a powerful interpretation of an equally powerful song. Mr. Bostridge can deliver robust songs as marvelously as he does tender ones...he has an ability to pull in the listener, in a manner which I have not heard for years. Each of the 24 songs is a gem, carefully accompanied by Julius Drake. It is a privilege to own this recording and I highly recommend it.

America's heartland, (Iowa, particularly, in this film) is undergoing some serious changes and Aaron Woolf's expos&eacute; on the commodity of corn is a welcome addition to those authors and filmmakers who investigate what we eat and how it's made. One thing stands out more than anything else....corn is ubiquitous.Gently told by Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, friends who move to Iowa to raise an acre of corn and then try to follow it to its destinations, "King Corn" goes farther than how corn is planted and tended. The lives of the residents of Greene, Iowa, where the film takes place, become central. This is not your average Chamber of Commerce town tour, by any stretch. Unlike the hard-driving Michael Moore or the self-absorbed Morgan Spurlock, Cheney and Ellis let the camera and the townfolk do the work. It's a winning combination and what the viewer learns from this documentary might not be shocking but nonetheless revealing in sobering terms. "King Corn" is well worth a look.

Richard Clarke has written a book about terrorism that extends from succinct analysis to thoughtful, reasonable solutions with regard to what has gone wrong since we were attacked on September 11, 2001. His thirty-year career in defense-related topics gives him a gravitas few others can equal and from that vantage point he has told his story. And what a story it is.By this writing, Clarke's &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; has become the book to read. After an initial report on what it was like to be in the White House on 9-11, Clarke begins in earnest to build, brick by brick, how the world situation developed with regard to terrorism, how Al-Qaeda became a force and how the United States responded to it. This is not a book that minces words. Clarke is very direct about whom he thinks did a good job and who didn't. There is very little conjecture on Clarke's part regarding the events that surrounded him. After all, he was there, at the center of the counter-terrorism table.What is coming to light more and more is the belief that the Bush White House had Iraq on its mind when it inherited power in January, 2001. After 9-11, Clarke makes one of his most telling points....that the United States had a window of opportunity after the attack to make the eradication of terrorism its main goal and it chose to invade Iraq, instead. The consequences will be seen in more Osama bin-Ladens created, a more vigorous Al-Qaeda and an enormous cost in lives and finances for the unforeseeable future.For those of us who shook our collective heads in disbelief when President Bush announced that Iraq had become an imminent threat to the United States in the summer of 2002, &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; is sadly refreshing to read. The directness and unity of purpose in attacking Iraq meant that the real threat.. terrorist attacks from Al-Qaeda.. were largely ignored by the new administration. While the American public accused President Clinton of &quot;wagging the dog&quot; when he bombed terrorist camps in Afghanistan during the Monica affair, Clarke points out that the real &quot;wag the dog&quot;.. the Iraq distraction.. has happened under Bush. The cost to the United States has been high already and the final price cannot yet be fathomed as there is no end in sight to our Middle East involvement.Paul O'Neill's recent book, &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; got us to rub our eyes for the first time about the current administration from an insider's point of view. Richard Clarke's book extends and expands the look into the White House and the reverberations of &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; will be felt as long as the war on terror is waged. It is the most important book of the year.

Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a monumental book about Lincoln and his cabinet. Another retrospective on our sixteenth president when there couldn't be another one, these days?... yes! And she succeeds. I can't imagine a book on Lincoln in the next generation as comprehensive and fulfilling as this.Ms. Kearns Goodwin sets up an exciting strategy...political and personal. Testing Lincoln against his colleagues, all, who wanted the 1860 presidential nomination, she offers a new look at the Lincoln prism in a way that changes the colors of the day. Not merely a fan of Lincoln, the author presents a wonderful new portrait of her subject. His cabinet had a certain ranking.....Seward was first and foremost. Chase, the peacock, was number two, until Stanton came along. Bates sagged in last place. And then there were the Blairs and Gideon Welles.There is so much in this book to be digested that it is worthy of a second read. The author's attention to detail is so good as not only to make the reader feel that he or she is part of the scene but to update it with different hues. Describing the Washington parties and the brass bands that played amidst the carnage not far away, Ms. Kearns Goodwin can only be outdone by the fact that she mentions time and again that ladies waved handkerchiefs from their windows at passing parades, soldiers and festivities. I loved those references of the book. Yet her tenderness in reflecting Lincoln's stopping to examine an oak tree when passing through Petersburg a few days before his death is as touching a paragraph as it gets.The author's love of Lincoln above all other presidents is evident. From an historical perspective, I can't quite agree with her about everything. The campaign for president in 1860 might very well have been due to Lincoln's personal skills and his ultimate advantage but luck played a pivotal role. It's one thing to say that if an opponent had faultered, the other might have won. But three others, at least? As she reminds us as well it wasn't until after the conventions of 1864 that the election could have been won by McClellan. Victories on the field changed all of that, for which Lincoln had some control, but not all of it.This is a terrific book.... a masterpiece by Doris Kearns Goodwin. I highly recommend "Team of Rivals", for its depth, understanding, and narrative style. It might be the best book you read this year.

I knew I was in for a treat when I first saw the cover of "F.U.B.A.R."...my state, Connecticut, was missing from the map, having been pried away by men who look like they might work for Halliburton. But when I read authors Sam Seder's and Stephen Sherrill's references to my hometown, Greenwich, (the prototype WASP community in America and tribal home of the Episcopalian Bush family) I was completely won over.To be sure, there are many highlights in the book but it is the authors' inventive humor that shines throughout. It was so nice to be reminded of Karen Hughes's "listening tour" of 2005, not to mention "Brownie" (of "your doin' a heckuva job, Brownie" fame just before his falling out with a lass named Katrina) and our old friend, Rick Santorum. Where are these people when we need them today? "F.U.B.A.R." could easily stand for "Fools Under Bush Are Republicans".It was hard to imagine at this point in reading "F.U.B.A.R." that the book could actually get funnier, but it did. The FDR speech to the nation following the attack on Pearl Harbor is re-written here as Bush might have delivered it and it's a classic. Their dissection of the self-serving Thomas L. Friedman is dead-on perfect but the line I laughed out loud about was this one: "You may find this hard to believe, but there are times when cable news is not covering missing white women". Bush and missing white women... the picture of America in the twenty-first century.It's not too late to give "F.U.B.A.R." as a holiday gift...just pick the correct holiday. This book is a gem. It would be fun to have Seder over for dinner (is that possible...?) and I'm sure the other guy is just as funny.

Joseph Volpe's "The Toughest Show on Earth" is a remarkably comprehensive look at the recent history of the Metropolitan Opera as told through the eyes of the retiring general manager, himself. Volpe has the best "view" in the house and no wonder...he's been there for over forty years.From the start it's clear that Joe Volpe is not a man to be crossed lightly. Tough as nails (and nails were part of his business) he rises from an entry level position to the top job...and reveals much along the way. There's just enough "dirt" in this book to tickle the senses of the reader and anyone who has ever been in opera knows exactly what Volpe describes...in order to be associated with opera personalities it is sometimes required to act like one.The longest chapter in "The Toughest Show" is devoted to Volpe's firing of Kathleen Battle and one can just see the steam building in the author's ears as he amasses stories of misbehavior on the part of the "embattled" diva over a period of years. Finally, he acts, much to the delight of the cast and crew. It's a juicy chapter and one of the best in the book. While Volpe offers reflections on just about anyone with whom he has come in contact, he reserves the nicest comments for conductor James Levine and (whom he calls the "Siamese Twins") tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. Without these three would there be a present-day Metropolitan Opera?There are occasional bouts of self-serving given over to by the author and often he feels a need to defend himself based on some past controversial decisions, (which I found rather astounding given the fact that he is departing the scene) but what makes "The Toughest Show" such a wonderful book is the comprehensiveness of the Met story. It's not only onstage and backstage but everywhere else, too. "The Toughest Show on Earth" is the greatest guided tour around. It's a terrific read and Volpe deserves much credit not only for this book but for a lifetime of service dedicated to one of the nation's treasures...the Metropolitan Opera.

The acme of Johann Sebastian Bach's choral works, the &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;, is generally well-performed on this CD. I am not at all happy, however, with the overly fast tempi of some of the choruses and many of the arias. The opening chorus, highly &quot;caffeineated&quot;, should have set a more serious tone for the succeeding body of music. Instead, it is glossed over as if it were a jig. Some of the arias race along without affording the listener ample time to let the chords settle in... a serious flaw in an otherwise good CD. I would recommend this CD for one reason especially...Ian Bostridge. His Evangelist has no equal. His expressiveness and musicality are in strong supply here and he sings a most difficult role with great care. It is a pleasure to hear this young tenor.

Neil Russack's book, &quot;Animal Guides&quot; was recommended to me by a therapist who works in dream analysis. There is much to be said for the author's book, but it takes some discipline to get through it.After a bumpy start Russack settles down as he begins to describe his patients' dreams and he seems to be a man who speaks from a good deal of professional experience. He devotes many pages to his patients and his connections with him. There are some wonderful moments about elephants and horses and dragons....Russack comes into his fullest when describing an elderly woman who can barely speak and how she is dealing with the end of her life. There are some funny moments, too.....a colleague who measured his steps from his back office to the outside at lunchtime, leapt down stairs only to find his car ticketed each day. Therapists need therapists, as they say.I came to the conclusion early on while reading this book that the author was more interested in talking about himself. There's nothing wrong with an autobiography but I had hoped for somethingmore detached from his personal life. A good textbook followed by a second book of a more personal nature would have established Russack in the public's eye. The author is not a great writer (and he needs a new editor!) but he spilled all his beans at once. Perhaps there is only one book in him.The good thing to recommend about Neil Russack's book is that those who read it might find it easier to approach therapy. Once taboo, therapy has become an accepted life force for many of us.

I rarely read a book through at one sitting but the late W.G. Sebald's masterpiece &quot;Austerlitz&quot; had me spellbound. From the opening pages to the inspiring conclusion Sebald takes us through a never-ending journey of love, loneliness, reflection and wonder.Austerlitz is a man of compelling complexity and through Sebald's bold and engaging writing one gets a sense of traversing time as Austerlitz sets about to find his roots. Nineteenth and twentieth centuries are skillfully blended. I rather like his use of long, descriptive sentences, giving this book a linear quality that keeps the reader pressing forward, as if the conquest is really to find our own roots. The black and white photos enhance the color with which Sebald tells his tale.Much has been written about the book's slow start. I didn't find that to be a problem and in fact I think it helped propel the desire to find out more about Austerlitz. Clearly, though, this book picks up steam as the focus on Austerlitz becomes sharper and more defined.If you have but one book to read this year, this one is the one.

Joan Didion's astonishingly frank new book, "The Year of Magical Thinking" is a wonder on many levels. That she couldn't express many of her private feelings with friends or strangers after her husband John Gregory Dunne's death is not surprising...that she could organize herself and write about hard core emotions to be shared with thousands of other people at a safer distance is understandable and welcome."The Year of Magical Thinking" takes place between John's death on Dec. 30, 2003 and ends one year later with the author's thoughts about the coming year, 2005. She traces her own internal tsunami (which includes the near fatal illness of her daughter Quintana) as she tries to begin to put her own life back together. This is a book about abrupt aloneness and the vacuum that follows. Most gratifying about "The Year of Magical Thinking" is the preponderence of questioning she does. There are questions about everything. How and when did John die? Could I have saved him? (Then about the ups and downs of their marriage)...Why didn't I listen when he said we weren't having any fun? Why didn't I move to change our life?If we all go through this type of loss at any given time, it is the good writer who will remind us through her own experience of how valuable, in an odd sort of way, separation can teach us about ourselves. Joan Didion is just that person and her one-year account of grieving (and subsequent mourning) is serious, informative and compelling.It wasn't until I finished "The Year of Magical Thinking" that I noticed the front dust jacket. The lettering is solid black, except for four letters which are a muted blue/grey. The four letters spell out "JOHN". I wondered how many other people have noticed that. Perhaps it is the author's way of keeping his memory fresh in readers' minds while trying, herself, to begin to put John in a slightly different place.Toward the end of the book, the author quotes the poet and literary critic, Delmore Schwartz: "Time is the school in which we learn/Time is the fire in which we burn". Joan Didion's time of reflection....one year....contains both learning and burning. She has written a remarkable book that I highly recommend.

I was pleased to discover Craig Whitney's &quot;All the Stops&quot; when a friend recently received a copy of the book. I was even more satisfied when I bought my own copy and finished reading it.Whitney has done a remarkable service to the world of pipe organs. For those of us who play the organ &quot;All the Stops&quot; contains a rich history of the instrument over the past one hundred years and it is told by an author who is an unabashed organ fan and player himself. Reading this book is like witnessing a tug of war on several levels. There is a battle of organ builders about whether or not to use tracker or electropneumatic action. Wars rage with regard to pipe vs. electric organs. How good are European organs when compared to organs in America? How much input should an organist have with regard to a particular organ being built? As Whitney underscores, the organ world is a rather elite one with egos and tempers as big as the instruments on which organists play. And all of this takes place under the shadow of two men....E.M. Skinner, one of the most successful organ builders of all time and the larger shadow of Johann Sebastian Bach.The most enticing chapters of &quot;All the Stops&quot; contain the mini-biographies of and the rivalry between the two best-known organists of the twentieth century...E. Power Biggs and Virgil Fox. The playing styles and personalities of the two couldn't have been more different and Whitney does a nice job in setting the two up in conflict. Biggs and Fox represented two different likes and dislikes of organs as well with Biggs preferring the European sound and tracker action and Fox opting for a larger, more romantic style. One of the key points that Whintey makes is that earlier in this century organists promoted the bigger, romantic organs only to have that phase pass as a generation ago the smaller, brighter tracker organs became more favorable. That tide has turned yet again.It is hard to believe that not too long ago thousands of people turned out for organ concerts....numbers that today would not be seen. But if Craig Whitney is correct, that tide is also turning. The pipe organ has no instrumental rival and its modern story is well-told in this book.

Alejandro Gonzalez Inarittu, the director of "Babel", has stitched together several fine stories into one film...certainly one of the triumphs of 2006. With not one mediocre performance in this lengthy cast, Inarritu manages to take four separate cultures...American, Mexican, Japanese and Moroccan to remind us not only of our shrinking world's great connections with each other but that we are all, in a sense, the same under the skin.Expansive and colorful, "Babel" is often breathless. Performances by Rinko Kichuki as a Japanese deaf-mute and Adriana Barraza as a Mexican nanny stand out. Brad Pitt, sharing the bill with so many other fine actors is convincing as an often tormented American husband trying to save the life of his wounded wife. All of this works together with such clarity and force that to see it just once would hardly give it justice.The real applause goes to director Gonzalez Inarritu. His scope is broad, the timing is well-paced and everything about "Babel" rings true. It is a masterful movie and one I highly recommend.

In a society which the author claims as his own, where half of marriages end in divorce, along comes this laugher. Society is moving away from this kind of Neanderthal thinking. Come on...even Dick Cheney would have a good romp over this one.

Brad Dunn's new book, "When They Were 22" is a breezy read concerning people we know and some whom we might not know as well. Highlights range from Stephen Hawking.....(his best entry) to Jerry Falwell (read it if you must). It's a great idea for a book and one that will click if you're past the ripe old age of 22, or even approaching it! I highly recommend it.

Tim McCarver's &quot;The Perfect Season&quot; does not live up to its title....namely, that the 1998 baseball season was the best ever. No one doubts McCarver's expertise in the game, but there's a long-windedness about this book, much like his broadcast style. McCarver has too many chapters devoted to players whose entry into the book was made because they &quot;hit 50 doubles and stole 50 bases in one season&quot;. I know that baseball is a game of statistics but this kind of minutiae (or&quot;dim-minutiae&quot;) is as meaningless as meat filler in a hamburger patty or a weatherman's recitation of the wind-chill factor....it gets boring very quickly. There are certainly some good chapters and well-deserved entries (the New York Yankees, Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire, and a wonderful tribute to Roger Maris), but I found myself being able to put this book down many times, even though the chapters are quite short. It's simply bogged down with too much useless detail.

Bunnies always look good in cartoons and Andy Riley's "The Book of Bunny Suicides" is terrific. Imagining that bunnies could actually place themselves in jeopardy is half the fun...the other half is waiting for the next page to see what the author has concocted. Buy this book and have a "blast"!!

It's hard to know where to begin to fault the Bush administration for its lack of competence, understanding and deception but the area of science is as good a place as any to start. Chris Mooney's new book, "The Republican War on Science" is a polemic of welcome proportion coming at a time when the country is being run by those so far "from the know". It's a disturbing look at the realities of present-day America.Mooney begins with a background of bipartisan approaches to science from Franklin D. Roosevelt through Jimmy Carter. He rightly fingers Ronald Reagan's administration as the the flashpoint of the current drift toward the polarization of science citing "Star Wars" (SDI) as the beginning of this trend. Focusing on two main themes, industry and religion, Mooney exposes tobacco companies, the sugar industry, the food industry, the leaders of the religious right and so many more....all who have come together under an uncertain umbrella to sow the seeds of scientific manipulation.How convenient it must be for industry to PAY advisors to dispute otherwise accepted scientific decisions when those decisions don't support their companies' points of view. The Falwells, Robertsons and Dobsons of this world are even on more tenuous ground. With no knowledge of science in their court, they have a knack for making things up to secure a religious grasp on their followers. But it's the politicians on whom Mooney scores most heavily. Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe gets the most wrath from Mooney but the author lists many other Republicans in Congress who "cherry-pick" (Mooney's favorite word) scientific findings until they can cobble together something that appeals to them. Appealing to them, perhaps, but appalling to the rest of us. Science polarization has been made manifest in science politicization.Chris Mooney, while presenting a serious and important work, nonetheless, is a better presenter of fact than he is a narrative writer. The first half of the book is very slow going and it's hard to keep track sometimes of all the (usually) three letter abbreviations. (NIH, EPA and CDC are well-known, but NAS, CRE and IPCC are less so, making a blur of organizations and where they stand) However, the second half of the book picks up considerably and when Mooney hones in specifically his book becomes an intense read.Who knows what the remaining years of the Bush administration and its relationship with science will be like, but through Chris Mooney's "The Republican War on Science", we have a clue. It's not going to be pretty. This is an important book on a deeply meaningful subject to all Americans. I highly recommend it.

"Cobra II", the recently-released book by Michael Gordon and General Bernard Trainor, tells the Iraq war story from a unique perspective. Concentrating almost entirely on the planning, invasion and occupation of Iraq, the authors relate a war strategy and deployment fraught with compound errors in judgment and administration. It is an amazingly well-told work.As in any story of conflict there are good guys and not so good ones. Gordon and Trainor are unsparingly critical of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and CENTCOM commander Tommy Franks. While Rumsfeld's views and applications have been roundly criticized before, Franks gets a harsh review in this book. The two made mistake after mistake, much of it due to their own unwillingness to hear views of others and their own self-assurance that their ways were the right ways. "Cobra II" does much to unravel their positions.If it seems early on that one easily gets bogged down by the book's heavy use of acronyms, (the military loves them and so do the authors) staying with this book is worth it. The narrative begins to unfold in a classic crescendo from the time the first U.S. troops entered Iraq and continues through a breathtaking couple of chapters describing "Thunder Run", led in part by the courageous, risk-taking Colonel Dave Perkins, with the solid overall support of Lieutenant General David McKiernan....two of the really good guys portrayed here. It's the best part of "Cobra II". What appears so new to me is that this story is a ground story (the events of the invasion, as most Americans remember them, came from reporting of air attacks). Gordon and Trainor don't just describe the plights of those who made it through... they tell also of the final moments of many soldiers who didn't come home safely.Making not much more than cameo appearances in "Cobra II" are President Bush and Vice-President Cheney, although their collective presence is channeled through Rumsfeld. The authors have, rightly I think, kept their focus on the men and women who actually were part of the invasion and occupation. The many maps (included in the front of the book) are a help in putting the invasion's movements into context.I highly recommend "Cobra II" for its sobering look at the war in Iraq. While the authors take strong positions they give a balanced account of the war, and ultimately, what went wrong with the aftermath.

It's easy to see why Sam Harris's hit book, "The End of Faith", is still commented upon two years after its initial publication. Harris says what many Americans think...religion is the downfall of us all. Laid out in stark reality and in a format which challenges those who don't think to think, Harris's book is controversionally correct.The author begins with an eye-popping indictment...moderate religious people are, in fact, dangerous. How they lend themselves to this positon is well worth the read of the rest of the book (and I would encourage you to finish it-it grabs your attention and holds it). Through many an historical perspective, Harris hammers home the absurdity of religion and what a refreshing voice is his. Oh, that Pat Robertson should read (or even comprehend) these many chapters of sense.There are some downsides to "The End of Faith". Harris, in trying to support his theses, often strays from it. He has a tendency to sound like the professor in Psychology 101...the narrative often sags and drifts. Harris also has an uncanny habit of mentioning people without introducing them...Fareed Zakaria, Alan Dershowitz and Jonathan Glover to name just three. The reader may know one, two or all three, but without some background it feels like walking into the middle of a conversation."The End of Faith" is a very good book and I recommend it highly. It could have been an even better book, however, if Sam Harris had had some guidance in telling his story in a more religiously focused and less academic way.

While browsing around my local bookstore yesterday I came across "Me and Orson Welles". The blurbs on the back cover sounded intriguing so I took the plunge, bought it and read it. Wow!Robert Kaplow (aka Richard Kenneth Samuels) wonderfully splits this story between the two protagonists, Samuels and Welles. While a chance meeting brings them together, Kaplow leaves it to Welles, the more brutally dark of the two, to command center stage as he directs everyone around him, both onstage and off. His play, "Caesar", is in fact his life, and Richard is drawn into the maelstrom as Welles deftly maneuvers his younger charge. There are surprises at almost every turn, which turn out to be less surprising as the layers of the "real" Orson Welles are peeled away. As Richard becomes more involved in his week with Welles he also becomes stronger and more assured and the book leads up to a dramatic climax that ends with great satisfaction."Me and Orson Welles" is a stunningly well-written book, nicely paced and told with great insight into the human condition. I highly recommend it.

It was just two hundred years ago that Alexander Hamilton was killed by Aaron Burr in the most famous duel in history. Thanks to Ron Chernow's excellent biography we have a fuller account of the man who was at the center of the founding of America and probably one of the least understood.Hamilton's life began on the Caribbean island of Nevis and had it not been for this inauspicious start in life Hamilton might have turned out more like the other founding fathers. Indeed, his accusers and enemies made great light of the fact that he was foreign-born. (and probably out of wedlock, as well) Yet Hamilton's incredible story has much to do with his early life in the islands and his sudden rise and short "tenure" as a founding father is one of the most remarkable things about him. Chernow captures this all in a style which allows the reader to see how Hamilton maneuvered his way up the chain. As an aide to George Washington at a very tender age, Hamilton became a privileged and trusted confidant of the general and it put him in a position of enormous influence and ultimately, power.Although the author trumpets Alexander Hamilton's assets....his gift for writing, clear argument and long-range vision, he adds that Hamilton could also be vain, verbose and not always politic in his decisions. Some of the best chapters of the book revolve around Hamilton's continuing battles with his enemies.....mostly John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. This, however, is also where the book falters. In promoting Hamilton he demotes his adversaries to a degree that makes them look unimportant. They become almost comic in their hatred of Hamilton and we know while there were times of heated debate and almost maniacal despisement between Hamilton and his contemporaries, the other founding fathers had many more attributes than Chernow seems to allow.That said, the author's writing is often mesmerizing. His use of quotations is an excellent device to show us the tenor and temperature of the day and his attention to detail is superb. The description of the duel is so good that I read it twice.Alexander Hamilton's legacy is as broad as it is unique. Ron Chenow has presented a work of thoroughness and enlightenment and I highly recommend it to other readers.

I began reading "102 Minutes" last night and didn't put the book down until I finished it. This is an exceptional offering, told with terrific insight, perspective and candor. The book's epilogue is hard-hitting but balanced.Although authors Dwyer and Flynn keep the book centered on the people who were in the towers on 9/11 they envelop the accounts of that morning with factual material necessary in completing their work. This includes a description of the planning and the building of the World Trade Center (and why and how it came to be put where it was), the physical layout of the site and the changes in the building codes which weakened, not strengthened the structure (not to mention the elevators and stairways). Dwyer and Flynn save most of their criticism for the fire and police departments with their historic bitter rivalry, culminating in a massive breakdown in communication that morning. For me, this was the biggest eye-opener in the book. Those thought to be heroes in the days and weeks that followed the collapse are reduced in large part, with exceptions, to being ineffective and almost insignificant bystanders in the tragedy. The authors note that the passage of time changes one's outlook on events and they have successfully made a case for gross mismanagement on the part of those two departments and the appalling conduct of city officials who dared not to be challenged when questioned in later hearings.In a tribute to Dwyer and Flynn, they tell the individual stories with great care and compassion. We've all heard of last-minute calls and emails from those trapped in upper floors, but I was quite taken by the selfless individuals who looked out for one another that morning as they tried to figure out how to descend stairways and help those in worse shape than they, knowing that their own fate might soon be sealed, as so many were."102 Minutes" is the most important book written to date about 9/11. It is delivered with great force and assessment and should be read by all.

"Les Choristes" is a film that could have been much better, given the nature of the story, itself. A French school's new prefect sets out to change the behavior of his reform school boys through singing, and thus melt their collective feelings of harshness about life, mirrored in their school administrator. It's a sweet film in many ways, predictable as they come, but the tension never really builds in the way one would hope, leaving some cloying scenes to fill the gap.G&eacute;rard Jugnot is nicely cast as the musician-cum-teacher, as is Franois Berl&eacute;and, the school's head. But the real star is one of the boys, Pierre Morhange, who is played superbly by the young French actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier. He has the perfect look for his part and acts with supreme confidence. If for no other reason, Maunier is worth a look at this film.

You'd think after a 46-year friendship that Ed McMahon would offer some deeper insights into Johnny Carson. Sadly, he does not. This book is simply a re-hash of old "Tonight Show" sketches with a few anecdotes thrown in.If you want to get a better picture of Carson, go online and buy some of the "Tonight Show" retrospectives. They're far funnier and a lot cheaper than this book. I do not recommend anyone purchasing "Here's Johnny"...it's largely a waste of time.

Of the dozens of books I have read and reviewed over the past few years, Sebastian Junger's "A Death in Belmont" is one of the hardest to judge. While it is well-written it is also suspect to an unobjective point of view by the author.Ostensibly, this is a book about the "Boston strangler", his murder spree in the early 1960s and Junger's brush with Albert DeSalvo, the man who was later identified as the strangler and convicted for the crimes associated with his moniker. Yet DeSalvo becomes almost a supporting character as Junger delves more deeply into the person of Roy Smith, a black man from Mississippi who murdered Junger's Belmont neighbor, Bessie Goldberg in 1963.Junger is at his best in giving full descriptions of the backgrounds of both DeSalvo and Smith and he's especially informative of how the legal system works (or did work) in Massachusetts. With a flair for unraveling a good story, Junger builds a parallel narrative of both men. He primes the reader with provocative questions, as well. However, as he continues, it is Smith who emerges as the real man of interest. In doing so, Junger steps over the bounds of objectivity and lends himself to side with Smith about the Goldberg murder. It's too bad because had he kept a fairer distance this would have been a first-rate offering.I can't give a recommendation for this book but I also wouldn't suggest that it not be read. It's not a bad book at all, but it could have been so much better.

I used to think that funeral directors must have the best conventions but after reading Marilyn Johnson's "The Dead Beat" I'll give the nod to obituary writers. This book is terrific from beginning to end and is full of humor, and, by the way, good writing.Johnson does more than simply offer anecdotal obituaries...she comments on death and aspects relating to it. This book has a warm feel...even if her subject is one some of us tend to want to forget. To be a successful obituary writer one seems to need a knack for humor, and not "black" humor, necessarily. The author gives us her best when she does indeed share some of the contributions she has uncovered. Johnson quotes a man named Bob Schenley, who wrote an obit of a Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster..."Almost everyone in Pittsburgh who loves baseball....loved Bob Prince, unless, of course, they actually knew him. He was a miserable mean-spirited drunk." My favorite, however, was this one written about Suzanne Kaaren, ninety-two, an actress who had appeared in several Three Stooges shorts. Penned by Stephen Miller, he said of Kaaren, "The Stooges seemed to value her opinion and regularly tried out new material on her." This kind of writing is dead-on funny.The unusual narrow shape of "The Dead Beat" gives the reader the feeling of scanning a newspaper and is another welcome addition. Johnson delivers a flow which never lets down and does not disappoint. I loved "The Dead Beat" and I highly recommend it.

It takes a dedicated person (or a nut!) to spend time with garbage as your companion, but Elizabeth Royte has done just that, and she did so over a period of many months. Her new book, "Garbage Land", is remarkably comprehensive, thoroughly engaging and downright fun.How many people know the names of their garbagemen? The author certainly does as she relates a time where she did a stint or two picking up garbage with the local "San Men" around her neighborhood in New York. (yes, there are women in the "pick-up" business, too) Ms. Royte duly notes the "rejectamenta" that leaves her home as she includes chapters from recycling, waste sites and sewage treatment plants, to landfills, incinerators and composting. All you've ever wanted to know about garbage and the six degrees of separation thereof, (and many things you've never cared to know) are contained in this gem of a book. To say that she has done her homework may be a bit of an understatement. Sifting through her own household garbage week after week must earn extra points as I know of no one who would ever want to undertake something like that.While the subject is indeed a fascinating one for her and for those of us who care to read about it, Ms. Royte is surprisingly (and refreshingly) not overly judgmental. Is recycling good, for instance? Well, yes and no, she offers. She introduces differing points of view and largely lets the reader decide. I must be honest and say that there are parts of "Garbage Land" that get heavily bogged down in technical terms and statistics, (which is why it took me a period of several days to get to the end) but the final "product" is as informative a look as one will most likely get these days.The author is good at giving some astounding facts. Referring to anthropology students digging through dry landfills she says, "forty-year-old hot dogs look just like the ones currently sold in the Times Square subway station. Seventy-year-old newspapers can still be read. Cling Wrap still clings". I laughed out loud when she mentioned that "as late as 1892, a hundred thousand pigs roamed New York City's streets, feasting on scraps tossed out doors and windows by the working poor"..... Times may have changed but garbage is still garbage.Elizabeth Royte has written a terrific book but she has also done a great service in enlightening us in an area of our lives about which most of us would rather not know. It is an eye-opener as well as a nose-opener. I highly recommend it.

After reading Mark Kurlansky's informative, yet disjointed book, I know more about salt than I ever would have known or might have cared to. While it's billed as a &quot;history&quot; of salt this book is really more like an encyclopedia. Digesting the facts about salt's ride through history, its effect on empires, its uses (and the best part....some great recipes!) takes some doing, but I give the author credit for his breadth of knowledge on the subject.The problem with Mr. Kurlansky's book is his writing style. The narrative is confusing as he jumps from century to century, east to west, north to south without a clue as to where he's headed next. He's the &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; of the information trade. Good histories make sensible unions with their subjects, but &quot;Salt, A World History&quot; becomes a dot-to-dot puzzle without the lines that are needed to connect. Unfortunately, that often means putting this book down. I'm glad I read it and glad I finished itbut if the author is going to write a sequel on pepper I hope he can redefine his presentation.

"Pets in America", an astonishingly comprehensive new book by Katherine C. Grier, relates the history of pets as we have known them from the earliest days of our nation. In doing so, she has given us a compelling look at the evolution of how different animals became popular pets, how we treat pets as a society and what their needs are compared to ours.Grier begins by asking "what is a pet?" and then follows up with remarks about "why pets matter". She sets the stage for the reader to begin to view the animals we call "pets" (and what Americans in the nineteenth century called "favorites") in a different way than just furry little creatures that greet us upon our return home. One of the many surprises I found in reading "Pets in America" was that one hundred to one hundred fifty years ago the most popular pet to have was a caged bird. She explains part of the reason by saying that there was far less noise around then and songbirds added a cheerful level of volume that was most welcome in many homes.While Grier's book understandably covers dogs, cats, birds and fish as the most common pets to find around the house, there is also a good deal of writing about livestock animals.....horses, swine, barnyard fowl and rabbits. There are many quotes from diarists of the 1800s and the most alluring ones come from children. Being much closer to "pets as dinner" she quotes a few girls who couldn't stand the thought of losing a newborn calf or lamb, knowing that it would end up on someone's dinner table....possibly their own. There's also a charming section on "the Bunnie States of America"....a club set up in 1898 by the children of an Albany, New York couple who had rules and regulations for their club, held meetings and wrote of the happenings of their beloved rabbits.Grier takes an awful lot of time in the middle of the book describing the liberal goodness of the upper middle class and their views toward treating animals with kindness and respect. Although she presents her case effectively, it is the one place where "Pets in America" bogs down a little but she picks right up again with a chapter titled, "Pet keeping and its dilemmas". As animals moved closer to humans with their increased indoor contact, boundaries necessitated change. Understandably, at the same time, livestock became more foreign to many Americans with the advent of the automobile, as horses were decreasingly necessary for transportation. However, Grier describes in great detail what city life was like prior to that with pigs running through the streets, chickens cackling in many a backyard and the undeniable stench of horse manure. The seemy side of pet life....those who dealt in the selling, trading and butchering of pets is a terrific addition to the work. It's hard to believe, sometimes, that we are just a few generations removed from all of that.The author finishes up with a look at the twentieth century arrival (on a large scale) of pet stores, pet food and other accoutrements such as "clothing" and bedding. There is not much about veterinary medicine in this book other to say that in earlier times, a pet's best caregiver (and often its only doctor) was its owner.Many wonderful, early photographs and drawings accompany "Pets in America". It's a welcome addition to a fantastic book. I highly recommend "Pets in America" for its depth and incisiveness and I applaud Katherine Grier for combining a straightforward analysis with an outstanding narrative.

In the light of Woody Allen's latest film, it's worth seeing "Midnight in Paris" again...or for the first time if you missed it last year. Hopelessy nostalgic Owen Wilson finds his true love at the stroke of midnight and the artists, writers and musicians he meets are, well, awesome. There are some magnificent performances to see and of course, who else could play Gertrude Stein but Kathy Bates?! The cinematography is terrific but perhaps it's the innocent look of Owen Wilson, himself, that wins the day. I highly recommend this film...it's one of Woody Allen's best.

For those of us who grew up watching Paul Lynde on "The Hollywood Squares", this is a difficult book to read. As I remember Paul's wit and delivery, "Center Square" pulls back the curtain and reveals a comedian who not only had a dark side, but a viciously dark side at that.It seems that Paul Lynde was earmarked for misery from the beginning. Overweight as a child he became a brooding heavy drinker, well aware of his sexuality at a time when homosexuality was in a different state of affairs than it is today. While Paul edged his way out of the closet and sobered up (at least from alcohol) the demons in his life seemed destined to carry him along and they did almost right to the end."Center Square" does have its lighter moments and oft-quoted lines from "Squares" and other shows in which Paul starred, or was a part of, help the book along. It gets off to a slow start with too many friends, co-stars and experiences listed (it's hard to keep track of them all!) but the book picks up when Paul begins his run in "Bye Bye Birdie".The authors have done a thorough job and to their credit this is a worthwhile endeavor. But the caveat is reading about Paul Lynde, himself. Tragic and funny, Paul Lynde will nonetheless remain a wonderful comic memory of decades gone by.

Whilst scanning my local bookstore's shelves for a quick read I came across "Rules, Britannia" by Toni Summers Hargis. After finishing it (in one sitting) I know not to say "it was 'quite' good", for that would indicate something less than extreme pleasure on my part. "Rules, Britannia" is VERY good, informative and funny and while our language differences deserve credit for the book's inspiration the author has earned all of the rest.Having grown up on the other side of the pond, Ms. Hargis has spent sixteen years in the States and has a perspective that is most welcome from an American point of view. For those of us who have spent a good amount of time in England, reading "Rules, Britannia" tells one more of the things one doesn't know but probably should. This is not merely a collective glossary of word translations (although at the end of each chapter there is one, relating to that particular chapter) but a look at what every American needs to know upon visiting the mother country. From transportation and food to shopping and partying, the author is a gentle teacher, or perhaps more of a cultural ambassador.What Toni Hargis does so well is relate things from an English viewpoint. I was surprised to see that the Brits find it very rude if you refer to another person in your midst as "he" or "she", or that if you cannot attend a dinner party it is essential (almost to a comical fault) that you let your host know exactly the reasons WHY you won't be there. I laughed out loud after reading about the fact that Brits never park their car leaving it in gear when the author then goes on to say, "if you borrow someone's car, for heaven's sake don't leave it in gear when you return it, or the owner will kangaroo straight through the garden wall next time the engine's turned on." Who can resist such advice?!Occasionally, you'll find some repetitions in the book....what you're reading you just read a few pages ago. A couple of additions would be good also... (unless I missed them) when stepping off the pavement make sure to look right before crossing the street (there are reminders on London streets) and if trying to book passage on BritRail on Christmas Day or Boxing Day, forget about it. I suppose this is a way of saying there is probably enough material for another book by author Hargis.....one I would stand hours in a queue to purchase!I highly recommend "Rules, Brittania". It's practical, down-to-earth and immensely enjoyable.

As described so often in "Growing Up Wrestling", people who enjoy wrestling, and are often turned on by it, understand one another and their collective stories perfectly. Those who don't can't figure us out. Wrestling is unique to thousands of men and the reasons for it vary.Although the 130 contributions that make up "Growing Up Wrestling" are individual accounts, there are common threads that appear. Many men got their first taste of wrestling at a very early age watching it on tv in the 50s, 60s and 70s, before it became over-commercialized. The fascinating aspect of this is that several of the contributors felt that watching wrestling on tv was something to "hide"....that it was inherently wrong. For others there was shame associated with an attraction to it. One thing is certain in most of the accounts...wrestling is a major dominating force in daily life and one that has a lifelong appeal in the most fundamental way.Victor Rook, who compiled this book, asked three questions (or asked to provide comments):1) When and how did you first discover you were attracted to wrestling?2) Describe your first and most memorable wrestling experience(s).3) Any other comments or insights you'd like to make about wrestling.It's a simple formula that works and one that keeps these narratives focused but often dramatic in their brevity. For those of us who are attracted to wrestling, it's hard to put this book down.Perhaps, as one writer suggested, we shouldn't dwell too much on what makes wrestling the core of our erotic existence but just enjoy it. He may very well have a point. Still, it would be nice to know what the allurement is and why it is so strong. Wrestling is full of holds that "lock" people up. In doing so, however, it is the ultimate expression of freedom.

I have never written a book review before I've finished a book but this one has had me in stitches since I opened the front cover. After seeing it on the shelf of my local bookstore I picked it up and "Latin for all Occasions" has made my day.Where else can one read lines like "Prehende uxorem meam, sis!" ("Take my wife, please!") or "Braccae tuae hiant" ("Your fly is open"). For those who have studied Latin or who simply have an appreciation for it, this book is for you. As for me, "Velim sumere Mariam Sanguinariam, sis" ("I'll have a Bloody Mary, please").

It's hard to reflect on the Vietnam era after watching this film, but the comparison is astounding after viewing this award-winning film about America's involvement in Vietnam made in 1974 when U.S. forces were still in southeast Asia. Nothing about this film is easy. And everything about it is timely. Presenting the people of that age is second to none and Michael Moore couldn't have made a better film today.This documentary is graphic and revealing. Anyone interested in American foreign policy over the past few decades would do well to see this. General Westmoreland's comments about the Vietnamese are as revealing of a problem as to why we are in Iraq today. "Hearts and Minds" surpasses all expectations and I highly recommend it.

Having sung in &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, my interest was piqued when I first heard about Mary Jane Phillips-Matz's wonderful new biography about Giacomo Puccini. Using his operas as chapter divisions, the author gives a firm basis on which to look at Puccini's life as he struggled with his music, his collaborators, his family, his publisher, his singers, Arturo Toscanini and himself.Restless and constantly on the move was Italy's greatest twentieth-century composer. The composer was not content to stay long in one place, she tells us. He had a house here, a house there; he didn't like this one, he longed to be at yet another one....this was no laboratory musician! Through the sharing of Puccini's letters (and he wrote unceasingly, it seems), Phillips-Matz offers us glimpses into the continual torment the composer faced, either from his own high standards and inabilities to finish projects to the endless revisions of present and past operas on which he was working. Puccini seemed to be under perpetual pressure. The author is careful not to be judgmental about her subect; in fact she includes a surprising number of revealing interviews that she, herself, conducted with singers who had performed Puccini operas and had worked with him in his later life.Phillips-Matz's book is not so much a book about Puccini's music as it is about process. How did the composer go about choosing texts? What was he feeling when he composed? How did he envision the final outcomes of his operas? The relationships with those who were closest to him are perhaps the best aspects of this book, especially those with his wife and Toscanini. The author almost seems to be encouraging the reader by saying this: &quot;here is what Puccini was like; now go hear his music and see what connections you can make.&quot;

Erik Larson is one of those rare authors who can keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat while combining two largely unrelated though fascinating stories. His 2003 "The Devil in the White City" was a stylistic triumph and Larson has returned to narrate a spellbinding chase across the Atlantic.While some might think it a huge stretch to parallel the lives of Guglielmo Marconi, the father of wireless communication and Hawley Harvey Crippen, the meek American ex-patriate doctor, (whose life outside the office is one for the history books) Larson toggles back and forth between the lives of these two men with amazing clarity and force. Given a penchant for narrative drama and wonderfully rich detail, the author succeeds in raising the stakes for Marconi and Crippen to intersect...not physically, but in a related manner that spells doom for one man and bestows a certain public recognition on the other.Marconi's story is the less intriguing although the better known. His early professional failures were often met with derision and his personal life was fraught with sadness due mostly to his decided immaturity and aloofness. Charming in public, he be cold and crass when the doors were bolted. Crippen, on the other hand, was beholden to his long-suffering wife, Belle Elmore, whose attempts at a stage career were not met with much public approval. The dutiful doctor-husband saw to Belle's demanding needs... until he "ran out of patience".The final chapters dealing with the hunt for Crippen as he tries to escape to Canada are well worth the read. Larson skillfully builds the drama through a series of puckish side characters. In one of the great ironies, Crippen is said to have admired "the wireless antenna.....from the Marconi cabin" while aboard the SS Montrose (his escape vehicle). Crippen exclaimed, "what a wonderful invention it is!" Captain Henry George Kendall, in on the sting, "could only smile and agree"."Thunderstruck" is a terrific addition to the growing list of "buckle-your-seat-belt" books by Erik Larson. It's a great way to spend a few hours reading about Marconi and Crippen, given the historical context of the times and Larson's way with words.

Robert Trachtenberg's compilation of stories from gays and lesbians entitled, "When I Knew", is a beautiful book. The accounts telling of that special moment when one first knew he or she was gay reflect a wide spectrum of emotion.....some are funny, others simply poignant or moving. Trachtenberg reminds us, especially, of a time when being gay was substantially more difficult than it is today, but it's also a reminder that those difficulties still abound. "When I Knew" should be required reading not only by men and women who have had, or do now, struggle with their sexual identity, but it should also be read by those who wish to make gay people's lives harder. When one reads these mostly short contributions it's hard not to feel empathy, love and concern. I highly recommend this book, not only for its beauty but also for its timeliness.
