Patterson delivers another smash hit in his book on the United States from Watergate to Bush v. Gore. This book is a less historiography study and more of a statistical approach than other oxford books but it is nonetheless expertly presented. The analysis is top quality and the sense of how the United States became restless (especially during the 1990's is apparent. Patterson makes a good argument that we have to wait and see what effect 9/11 will have and whether or not it was the changing milestone. If you are interested in this time period this is a must read. For those who are interested in American studies this is an essential book for your library.

If you want to understand the Arab Israeli conflict this is the best book that you can get. Covers the relevant history and deals evenly with both sides. Points out Israel's start of the suicide bombings and shows the ineffective nature of the PLO in getting their demands through unreasonable leadership. Overall it is just an excellent book that gets straight to the point about its topic. If you are looking for a book that talks about terrorism or the conflict in the Middle East this is a great place to start. This was a wonderful textbook for a class on the Arab Israeli conflict. The history was clearly outlined and made for useful discussions of how the conflict evolved.

If you want to know how the United States became a great power this is the book to read. The United States quest for empire and manifest destiny can be summed up by the five men covered in this book: TR, Elihu Root, John Hay, Alfred Mahan and Henry Cabot Lodge. The book focuses on conquest in the Philippines, Cuba and Mexico as well as the importance of the Panama Canal. It is a very interesting read that offers a lot about the course of US Empire. Imperialism and Americanism can be seen as one in the same during this time period and these five people acting together set America on a course to become not only a great power but eventually a super power. A must have for anyone interested in America's imperial past.

This short book does an excellent job of understanding the strategy and tactics that went into the War of 1812. While not the most detailed account of the war it is certainty the most useful. It clearly outlines what happened and the significance of each event. It covers the Indians, Detroit, war in the south, and the burning of the capital. It does an excellent job of understanding the Madison administrations failures and talking about the victory at Baltimore. Highly recommend.

Continental airlines was a major disaster in 1994. Gordon Bethune did a major turnaround of that company and unfortunately he does not tell us how he did it with the exception of cutting costs. He was so busy talking about how wonderful he was that he forgot to tell us how to turn the company around and not just the end results. It is still an interesting book for those who are interested in the airline industry but don't expect to get much out of it if you are looking for the story of continentals turnaround.

This book provides an excellent analysis of the American involvement in the Arab Israeli conflict. It categorizes the conflict's resolution as a process evolving towards peace. The book picks up in 1967 with American involvement in trying to resolve the six day war and the aftermath where the Arab countries began thinking about a resolution to the conflict. The 1973 war marked another turning point in the conflict and the US response began to crystallize and become consistent with a possible solution. It became clear that the Soviet Union's quiet acquiesce would be necessary. The American negotiations are very clearly laid out in this book and the author does an excellent job of establishing motive. This is a wonderful book if you have a good knowledge of the conflict. For those seeking that history I would recommend Benny Morris book Righteous Victims.This book really shines in the Nixon and on era where the author clearly categorizes the diplomatic efforts of the Kissinger Shuttle, Camp David Accords, the Oslo agreements and the Road Map. Overall the author is fairly unbiased and places blame where appropriate. The one place where this is lacking is in the analysis of George W. Bush. While Bush has done little towards solving the crisis the second to last chapter is more about the war in Iraq and why it was a bad plan than why it detracted from the ability to focus on the Arab Israeli conflict. Despite this it is still the best book we have on American diplomatic history in this conflict and well worth the time to read if you want to understand the conflict.

Jared Diamond does a decent job of using anthropology to talk about history. Well there are flaws in his theory on the history of some of these peoples the idea is one that bears some thinking. The idea that societies overpopulation can cause them to fail is an idea that has merit today. Diamond goes all the way up through China and India to talk about their overpopulation and resource issues. In a Malthusian way he analyzes food and climate concerns related to the Mayan civilizations which are where his book gets the weakest. The Mayan collapsed due to other factors than what he gives credit for (See Conquest, Borken Spears, ect). This book still bears consideration though and is interesting to read about.

Richard Reeves delivers yet another well done biography of a United States president. For those unfamiliar with Reeves style, his presidential biographies start with day one in office and end on the day the president leaves office. It really gives an inside view to what a day in the life of that president is like. So there is a note of caution since the book moves linearly and not topically it requires a great deal of extra attention as you may see one thing about Iran Contra but then go thirty pages before seeing something else about it. Like Reeves other presidential biographies there is also a human theme to underscore the understanding of the president and in this case it is that Reagan while not an expert of all the facts knew how to use the imagination of the American public to be the president they needed at the time.This book does not portray him as a crusader against the evil empire, or the grand architect of Soviet defeat but for what he was; a man who held great zeal and passion for a brand of religious conservatism and a belief that people should be free. This book tracks through the good and the bad addressing the issues that plague Reagan's legacy. From the widening gap of wealth and the diminishing welfare services, the myth that he was often asleep at the wheel, and that Reagan was a war monger who abhorred peace. While Reeves does not agree with Reagan's politics he provides a fairly objective analysis on a president whose legacy still guides a party and insight into the man that Ronald Reagan was. For those who want to understand more about a fascinating modern politician this is the prefect place to start and well worth the time to read.

The Mexican Revolution was at its most bloody point during this decade and spilled over to the United States on some occasions. This book analyzes the role of the Texas Rangers, Untied States Military and other groups during the time of the revolution. Mostly it is a policing action to keep violence from spilling over into El Paso but occasionally they are attacking cattle rustlers who cross the border including Pancho Villa. The Texas Rangers were essential in defending the frontier during this timer period and performed many valuable services. While there are several books that exist on the Texas Rangers this is the only one that I have run across that really explains their role within Texas as a whole. Both authors do an excellent job of bringing their knowledge about the revolution and weaving it within the context of Texas History. Their discussion of the Plan de San Diego which was an attempted revolt by Mexicans across the border was truly terrifying and they do an excellent job of giving the governments response to it. This book is excellent for anyone who wants a knowledge about how state forces responded to a crisis during the early 1900's. For those who love the Texas Rangers this is a must have to their library.

This book does a good job of outlining President Hayes life but it falls short in other areas. It does not give a sense of the country and how Hayes affected it. It suffers from being far too brief and does not even hit all of the highlights in his life. For those who want to get a sense of the president that is about all this can be used for. If you are looking for something that gives you information on the corrupt bargain or the start of the Gilded Age this book falls short.

The story of how the big three networks were broken to allow a fourth to develop is a great one. The stagnation of the big three combined with the drive at fox was amazing. Particularly instructive is at the start of each chapter there is a sheet that tells you how many programs they had on during primetime. You really get a sense for how important the match ups and programming are in order to get a network off the ground. This is just an all around good business book.

If you are going to take a tour of New England this is a must have book. It includes great ideas for touring around Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. If you are only going to Boston you are probably better off buying the cheaper Boston guide but any tour of New England needs this book. The pictures are great and as always the division by region is a great way to see things. Whether you are touring the whole thing or just a few states this book is an excellent start.

Vienna is a fascinating place to visit and this is a great book to use. For once I did not find the subdivisions as useful in this book. Vienna can be a very confusing city to get around until you get the hang of it and sometimes the street maps in the book cut off in odd places. Despite that the recommendations of things to see and do and the smaller maps were top notch. I saw almost everything this book recommends within one jam packed three day weekend. Highly recommend.

This book has been invaluable in planning things from the obvious like the Smithsonian's and the mall to the obscure like the international Espionage museum. I highly recommend its use for planning a trip in the area. Good DC Subway map as well as excellent recommendation on restaurants and hotels. The pictures are wonderful for understanding the various areas.

For those looking for a thorough and fair book on Andrew Johnson this is the place to start. His tumultuous career from building himself from nothing to achieving the presidency proves to be a fascinating story. The look at rural Tennessee politics through the state machines of centered in Nashville provides a fascinating contradiction of times to today. Quick thinking and stump speaking were the tools of the politicians and Andrew Johnson proved to be a master.Johnson may have been on of the most conservative presidents in our history favoring the reduction in government and keeping government out of all aspects of life and trade. His viewpoints provided a strong counter to the internal improvements crowd of the time and he went so far as to even oppose government funded roads. His strong sense of union left him in a position to be an obvious candidate for the vice presidency despite his previous breaking with party lines. As Lincolns vice president he would serve a function of representing the south's interest. Before his ascension to that position he had been the military governor of Tennessee and worked tirelessly to bring the state back into the union and ensure that it would be loyal afterwards despite accusations of his forming a dictatorship.Johnson served as president between two strong factions that Lincoln had kept balanced out. Johnson did not have Lincoln's political savvy and it led to his impeachment but not conviction. While he was unable to run again for the presidency he was able to stay active in politics and served his party well. Andrew Johnson is a great political enigma and one that is often ignored. This is a highly recommended biography to learn more about a man who is not studied often.

Hugh Thomas account of the Spanish Civil War is the most thorough version of the events written to date. His writing style makes the reader believe the entire account could be fiction. It is very easy to read and you hardly feel like you are reading history at all. The Spanish Civil War is one of the most devastating conflicts of the 20th century. It is the precursor to World War II and showcased as well as trained some of Germany, Italy and Russia's top talent. The sheer devastation of tactics involved bullied a civilian population and decimated a country. The rise of Francisco Franco and his victory over the communists was made possible by fascist intervention. The democracies of the world worked hard to try and effect a peace but they were unsuccessful against the determination of the fascists and the communists to prolong the conflict. This is a complicated conflict to understand but Hugh Thomas tries to simplify it as much as he can. This is the best start to understanding the Spanish Civil War and for those who want to understand how World War II began.

While this book is a classic in American history it does not compare to modern histories. While Parkman selectively uses his evidence and omits key details the prose is very good. Overall though this book should not be used due to the inaccuracies. He also omits the contributions of the Indians which was a decisive factor in the war. See either Crucible of War, Empires at war or The Scratch of a Pen.

The Panama canal was an essential part of American empire and I expected to hear about that as I read this book. While the focus on empire was not found here a tale of disease and hardship was. The sheer mechanics of building this project were amazing and this is a must read for all technological historians. McCullough weaves a complex tale with ease and the reader cannot wait to find out what happens on the next page. The construction and political decisions will make the reader cringe at times but the eventual triumph will bring a smile to any reader. This is one of the great McCullough books that is often left out but deserves great acclaim. I encourage all to read!

There have been few attempts at writing a biography of George Washington but Ellis nails it perfectly. This book stays on topic and tells us the essentials of the Presidents life. The dilemma of setting up a government and George Washington's style of leadership is shown well throughout the whole biography. It is a very quick read and was very well written like many of Ellis books are. This is one of my favorites by him and a valuable addition to the revolutionary literature. For those who are just starting out in the American Revolution this is a great place to start. For those who are long time students this is a worthwhile addition to any library.

Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal.

Robert Massie does an excellent job regardless of the subject he writes on. His masterpiece on Peter the Great is a dazzling 700 page ode to Russia's rise. Peter the Great helped to expand the borders in all directions of Russia and built his namesake St. Petersburg. His interest in integrating with Europe and establishing a navy are all well covered in this book. It all focuses on the Great Northern War with Sweden which gives the Russians a coast on the Baltic sea. Everything about this book is well done from the writing, to the research to the organization. I highly recommend it for even those who are casually interested in Russian history. You will not be disappointed by reading this one!

From a discussion of a daring plan to plant dynamite underneath confederate lines to the chasing down of Lee's Army by Grant a true sense of what happened during the civil war can be gathered form this trilogy. An essential collection to any civil war historical library.

Elliott delivers the masterpiece that those who study the Atlantic World have been waiting for. The idea of studying history from the perspective of the Atlantic has been growing in popularity and worth taking a further look at. Britain and Spain established mammoth empires and Elliot looks at their rise and fall. He also considers other powers including the French and Dutch but focuses mainly on the first two mentioned. The age of exploration is put in context and in true Atlantic fashion the slave trade and development in Latin America are very important. The revolutions of the Atlantic world are very clearly explained in this book and Elliott leaves you wondering where else this field can go. Elliott writes very well and this book is a must read for those who want to consider how the Atlantic world impacted Europe and the United States.

Part 2 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy of the Civil War is an interesting look at the road to Gettysburg through the eyes of the army of the Potomac. By the end of this book the army is ready to go and win under a new commander but you can see how the politics involved have worn down the morale of the army. It is very well written using historical accounts and while newer works have added more and disproved some of Catton's conclusions it is still one of the best books on the civil war.

Part 1 of Bruce Catton's fantastic trilogy on the Civil War is a great way to start learning about one of the most interesting conflicts in American history. While recent accounts offer more and have gone into a better analysis using modern historical tools this still remains one of the most interesting looks at classical history. This book really focuses on the relationship of McClellan to the soldiers and does a decent job using historical documents to make his point. While there are many rich documents out there and the status of McClellan has changed since this book was written it is still an interesting account of the time.

Although only in office for one month as President of the United States, William Henry Harrison's life was filled with one fascinating adventure to the next. From his countless military campaigns, to his administrative experiences as governor of the Indiana Territory, to representative and Senator from Ohio his life touches on many pivotal moments in American history. He was not always revered as a military hero but deserved his accolades as the greatest general since George Washington. He mastered the little known tactics of mass and concentration to deliver a blow against the British and their Indian allies at several battles the most famous being Tippecanoe. Although suffering a set back at the Raisin River Basin, Tippecanoe as he was quickly being called pulled feats Indian diplomacy that showed compassion and forethought depriving Tecumseh of his followers and eventually a military strike at Prophetstown finished them. For those who want to see the western and frontier view of these years in American history this is a great place to start and well worth the time to learn about one of our little known presidents in American history.

This book is a very well conceived idea that tries to understand what happened at the Alamo through the eyes of three people. Each provides a different perspective to life in Texas and life in the United States in the time period leading up to the Alamo. A crook like Bowie has fled from land speculations schemes and is trying to make a name for himself in Texas. Travis has abandoned his family and gone to make an honest life and escape the debt he built up. Finally we have David Corckett the hero of Tennessee who has lost elections and patience with Andrew Jackson heading to Texas. All of these three have led colorful lives with Crockett being the most interesting. This book serves as a biography to all three while describing the importance of the Alamo to Texas. It is very well done and you find yourself going through the book very quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in understanding what life looked like in the United States in the years leading up to the Alamo.

Using his position as a journalist in Germany he explores many facets of the regime from the military to the social structures. The book is very well written and don't be deterred by its length. This is a great book to start off with if you want to learn about Nazi Germany. I found it quick to read and an essential collection to my library on the history of Nazi Germany. Highly recommend.

For just general reading I would recommend Gordon's An Empire of Wealth but for others looking to teach or do an independent study this is a must. It clearly lays out all the developments in our economy very carefully and does a wonderful job of discussing current and relevant literature so you can specialize in the areas that you wish to look at further.

This book really gets what the new technological trends for the future are going to be. The idea of search is very clearly explained and it gives a good overview of how the internet developed and why. The author writes very well and brings in some of the excellent stories along the way. The idea that the internet can permeate our culture is already underway and Battile gains creditability with some of his predictions. Most notably the UTube acquisition which was not underway at the time he wrote this book. I highly recommend this book for those who want to understand the future of technology and where we are heading.

The Life of a Lone Star Yankee provides an interesting and thoughtful look a George Bush Sr. and how his life impacted his presidency. Parmet provides a balanced look at Bush looking at not only his presidential time but his personal and business life as well. He traces Bush's role as a man who makes money and then enters public service and approaches it as a family way of life. By taking a family approach and showing how the eldest Bush impacted his son and grandson the 43rd president a pattern does begin to emerge. Barbra's role as a mediator and show piece of family values is also apparent throughout his life. George Bush Sr. seems to relish being President and strove to make the best decisions possible within each of the decisions he made as President. From war with Iraq and Panama to social decisions such as Supreme Court nominees and tax hikes he gave careful thought to each decision. His skills as a campaigner were impressive and well detailed and his rise was largely through the talent of Ronald Reagan's teams and not his own.Parmet shows the successes in school, business, and marriage, his time at the CIA and his accomplishments as President. On the other side he shows the struggles in campaigning, in his role as vice president and reconciling his beliefs with Reagan as well as the trials and tribulations as President. If one is looking for a biography that bashes the president this is not it but it does point out his faults and despite what other reviews said it is not simply the greatness of Bush but a fair evaluation. Overall this book provides a look at if you want an excellent overview of George Bush Sr than this is the place to start.

As someone who reads widely on the airline industry this book was really quite interesting. This new airline bent the rules in a time when the majors were cutting back and developed a winning formula for success. Peterson does an excellent job talking about the early day of the airline and sets the reader up to be curious about how it will do in the future. She had great access to all of the relevant players. If you are curious about how the airline industry has changed and what they need to do to get back this is a great place to start.

David McCullough delivers another knockout in this biography of Harry S. Truman. It is truly a complete study that shows how the president evolved as a person and became one of the best presidents in our history. He is clearly one of the most overlooked and few people realized the trying times he endured. In the first year of his presidency he weathered more crises then Lincoln, FDR or JFK. He did it with no knowledge of the resources at his disposal and achieved success through straight talk and honest decisions. Truman's background as a farmer in Missouri had positioned him as the common man in the white house. From bankruptcy in the suit business to a farm that was on the decline Truman rose through adversity. He married his sweetheart and served as an officer in World War 1. These struggles would prepare him for a life in politics. One of the more interesting parts that I feel has been overlook in other reviews is the time with the political machines in Missouri. The political machine era which was its peak in the Gilded Age was still strong in the 1920's and Great depression. Truman navigated the machine to become a senator and work his way by being the dark horse vice presidential candidate.When Truman became President upon the death of FDR, both the world and Truman were shocked and afraid for what might happen. He used the information at his hands and prepared for the Potsdam conference where he did as good a job if not better than FDR would have done. His decision to use the bomb is laid out in very clear detail in the book and despite the critics there were few if any people telling him not to use the bomb. The post war period is where Truman really shines and handles several domestic crises very well. The railway strike and coal minors strike threaten to cripple the country and Truman's use of political bluster is impressive. The recognition for the state of Israel also occurred under his tenure and was one of the most critical decisions a United States president would make. Although the republican congress that comes in causes problems it sets the stage for one of the most interesting reelection campaigns in history. Truman vs. Dewey was a reversal of almost any incumbent election. Truman was the one on the defensive and had to take his case to the people. He did an amazing whistle stop tour which visited towns across the country. He was forced to defend his civil rights record and the fair employment act and desegregation of the military. Although Dewey appeared the favorite Truman eeked a victory by wining several key states some by a margin of only 5000 votes. The famous newspaper is shown in the book and the results of polls and the press are described well.Truman's second term in office started off smoothly and was characterized by the successful resolution of the Berlin Airlift and the establishment of NATO. The Korean War was the defining moment of the second administration. It was Truman's chance to stand up to the Soviet Union and show that he was not soft on Communism. The height of the red scare demanded tough tactics. The war is covered with the right amount of detail as is the struggles with General McArthur. The final part of his presidency is taken up with another series of strikes. Truman also did more to establish the office of the Presidency than any other president. He cultivated the symbols such as the limo, plane, yacht and railcar. He spent millions redoing the White House and making it a true symbol of power. These factors contribute to one of the most interesting times in American history. For those who want to learn more about what shaped the modern nation this is the place to start. The book flows very well and is through in the information provided.

John Niven presents a straightforward and well researched book on the life of John C. Calhoun who was one of the most influential people in the antebellum period. Calhoun represented the last of the Jeffersonian states rights politicians who clung to the virtues of small government in a chaning time. While that is often lost in his views on slavery it is important to remember as Niven points out that his arguments were not rooted in race but in keeping government small and protecting the farmer. He was against many internal improvements, against the tariff, against the national bank, against many of the things that expanded government power vis a vis the state. He was considered a member of the great triumvirate who with Henry Clay and Daniel Webster debated the great issues of the day and worked out the compromises that prevented Civil War from happening sooner. (See Merrill Peterson's book the Great Triumvirate). I think Nevin has it correct that despite this image of three great men representing sections of the country it was far from true particularly for Calhoun who was never the dominant statesman of the South (although he was the dominant representative for South Carolina).Calhoun would serve as a vice president, secretary of state, senate, house, and secretary of war during his tenure in politics. While always trying he was never able to achieve the presidency due his fractious support. He was easily a national name but his scattered support across many states was never the majority in those states. In many cases he was defeated by the patronage machines that were coming into existence and would be the norm following the Civil War. He had as many enemies as he did allies and his hatred of the Jackson/Van Buren group isolated him within that party. Many other books on the subject have asserted Calhoun to be a radical and I think Niven has it right that in the context of his time he was not a radical but was expressing the dying viewpoint as new political parties were forming in the early years of the Civil War leaving Calhoun on the outside. He was always remembered for the modernization of the War department and many of the things he created from inspector general to a modern supply system and health system would be utilized by both sides in the civil war and are still in use today in much the same form.Overall this is well written, straight to the point and while it can be dry it is well worth the read. Although I did not spend much time on it I should mention that Niven spends a lot of time on Calhouns family, financial and personal problems and how he separates them from his time in office.

This is a great effort by the people at Forbes to categorize historical business trends. They do a wonderful job telling us various stories from the founding days of the United States to Henry Ford to modern day America. They are all very interesting and very well researched stories. The writing is easy to read and interesting and you will want to hear more. I am hoping they put out another one because there are many great stories to tell and this is only the beginning. Highly recommend whether you are interested in business, economics or history.

Evans does another masterful job in presenting the history of the Third Reich. This books tracks the ways in which the Nazi's shored up their power domestically and the mobilization towards war. The end of the book does cover some of the foreign policy considerations but as always it is the domestic scene where the research really shines. From looking at the anti-Semitism to the centralization of police there is a voluminous amount of information here. The book is very well written and if there is any fault it is that you get almost too bogged down in the information. If you are just starting to look at the Nazi regime a classical book such as William Shrier's might serve you better but for those who really want to understand how the Nazi's transformed Germany this cannot be beat.

Gary Allinson delivers an excellent summary of the post war history of Japan and the major trends that occurred following World War II. Overall it is a quick read with a focus on the societal and economic changes. He also touches on cultural and political changes but does not go into a great deal of detail. If you know very little about post war Japan this is a great place to start but not for the experienced reader in those areas.

This very easy to read biography of Mussolini is an interesting study into the life of this dictator. It is by far one of the most pro-Mussolini biographies that one can find. There is little criticism of the dictator and his life is glazed over in some areas. Despite this it makes for a very interesting and refreshing perspective. I would not allow this to be the only biography of Mussolini that you read but it does make for a new perspective. While RJ Bosworth's book tries to make a balanced approach and ends up as a semi vindication this book combined with say Dennis Mack Smith's biography would really give a good view of Mussolini. The title is somewhat misleading and this really is mostly a domestic book that looks at the Duce's rule in Italy. There is some attention paid to foreign affairs but at the end it is mostly domestic. I think that this book can be useful in the context of a simple biography that looks positively at Mussolini but it is only one small piece of a very complicated puzzle and could have done much more hence the three star rating.

Robert Massie's approach to understanding World War I through the naval battles is original and thought provoking. It is one of the best he has ever written and the prefect accompaniment to his book Dreadnought. The book tracks how the German and British navies reacted during the war and the strategies employed by both. Whether it is the chasing of cruisers around South America or the battles between the Grand Fleet (Great Britain) and the High Seas Fleet (Germany) the detail and analysis is top notch. One of the more interesting side stories that Massie pursues is the invasion of the Turkish straights. This British naval disaster is captured perfectly by Massie and its overall importance in the war done well. Through his book you see a crystallization of British strategy that explains many of their actions in World War I as well as what will occur in World War II. Wireless telegraphy being new allows the First Sea Lord Winston Churchill to personally move ships which will become his method of operation in World War II.The battle of Jutland is obviously a major focus of the book and done very well. The basic fleet movements are captured as well as the implications of strategy and the realities of command in World War I. The new development of Room 40 which was decoding German dispatches and relaying them to the British fleet proved pivotal over the course of the war. The British were not sure what to make of these initially and only used them sparingly. Following Jutland the book does an excellent job of showing how America was able to enter the war through the defeat of the German U-boats via the convoy. Overall the book is excellent and an amazing read for those who want to understand the aspects of naval warfare and World War I.

There are several accounts on Trafalgar and this is one that I would put in the middle. It cover the basics of the battle and the people who fought in it and hits on all of the salient points. The storm is covered in the best detail of any book which is why this one is worth some attention. Overall though the book is very slow to get through and not as well written as others. The information is good but it does not add anything really new to the debate that is already ongoing. Overall if you are starting out on Trafalgar I would find another book but if you are looking for a decent refresher on the subject this will work.

This is among the best books on world history that has ever been written. This covers the history of oil from Spindeltop to Saudi Arabia. It stops at the first gulf war although a second edition is in the work to bring it up to more present times. Although a daunting length it truly is an amazing book that is well written. Once you start reading you will not put it down until the end so set aside plenty of time to read. This covers politics, geology, history, and economics in a wonderful blend that is smart and convincing. It is very well researched and Mr. Yergin does an excellent job presenting his material. Highly recommend and 10 starts is deserved for this monumental work.

The Fall of British Asia is one of the better analyses of how the British Empire came under strain during the course of World War II. This accurately assesses the effect that the Japanese had on the Crescent of British power and a look at what happened to the British islands of the pacific. Although many colonial groups thought the Japanese would be their key to freedom they quickly realized how wrong they were and this book does a great job of not only showing the colonial side but the British and Japanese sides as well. These authors are two of the best within the field and they deliver another winner here. This is a great introduction to what happened to East Asia during world war II and is a great place to start.

American Economic history is an amazing story and this is one of the few books that chronicles it well. If you want to understand how the United States is the industrial power it is today than this is the book for you. While I feel it leaves out some of the institution ideas that make our economy strong it gets the technological and political ones right on the head. Gordon writes very well and you feel as though you are ready a story as opposed to history. This is highly recommended for anyone trying to understand our history today.

This is one of the best first hand accounts of a little known battle in the Pacific. While almost everyone has heard of Okinawa which was a great success for the Marines despite heavy causalities the disaster at Peleliu was something different. Peleliu was a vicious and protracted fight for the marines. The hard fighting that would take its toll and Sledge recounts it with stunning clarity. It is hard to find good accounts of World War 2 and this is one of the best. This book is an honest and clear account and is a must have for any World War 2 buff. This was part of a military history class that I took and if anyone is looking for a book that can show the horrors of World War 2 as well as the triumphs this is the book for you.

Hewlett Packard is a now disgraced company that has severe problems to face in the future but this book will take you back to the HP of old. It tells how a printer company was developed to fill a need and the way in which they did business. I am normally not a fan of these books (The .... Way) but this one did a good job. It is short and to the point filling in the gap of an interesting company. It is worth a quick glance over if you are interested in the tech industry to see how a company should be run.

Ari provides an interesting book in his autobiography as President Bush's White House Press Secretary. I always hate to review books like this because they are so politically charged and ideologues on either side tend to get in a huff over what you say. I will endeavor to keep this as neutral as possible. This book sets out to accomplish many objectives but only hits half of them. First and foremost it is one of the best looks at the role of the press secretary and the sheer stress the job has on a person. Whether you like or hate President Bush there is no one who can deny that the role of press secretary is a hard job especially under a tight lipped and secretive white House. Andy Card's goal as chief of staff was to keep leaks to a minimum which frustrates the press leaving their only source of information the press secretary. When the press secretary is instructed not to discuss military matters it becomes even more adversarial. One of the interesting things learned from the book is what viewpoint the Press Secretary is supposed to have. I found it fascinating that he is only there to represent the views of the president and that does not necessarily have to be the wishes of the branches of government that report to the president.One of the other objectives was to provide a critical narrative of the press and give insight into the White House Press Crops. I found his look at the White House Press fascinating and he really does put you inside the room of the toughest reporters in the United States. He illustrates well his points about the adversarial nature of the press and the desire of the press to create conflict which leads to stories. Many times the same questions are asked over and over hoping for a slip that the Press Secretary cannot afford to give. One of the angles that I think he does handle poorly is the bias of the press. While there are voluminous studies to show that the press is slanted right Ari seems to not acknowledge that all media is biased in one direction or another. The White House press does not give passes to any president. People today do not trust the news they get from the press and rightly so due to the biases that are present be they Fox News or MSNBC. While he highlights the point of on the liberal media it is done far better by Benard Goldberg in his book Bias.Finally Ari tries to make a defense of President Bush and his policies/leadership style. Some of his book seems to be aimed at knocking down the arguments in the Price of Loyalty. While this is another viewpoint again the truth probably lies in the middle. Some of his defenses of trying to shift blame to the press for starting up the Iraq war are fairly ludicrous. Ari does not sit in on any of the national security briefings and the president preferred himself to comment on those matters leaving Ari in a hard position to comment on them after the fact. One of the things he does refute well that many agree with is the loyalty that Bush shows to those who are loyal to him. There is a clear look that Bush's leadership style does work within his White House and he is respected by the staff. Ari also seems to take it upon himself to set the record straight and show the country that Bush did not think of the war in Iraq in a vacuum that many other people including the press also had the same idea along the way. He is largely successful in this although he glosses over one of the critical mistakes. The landing on the USS Lincoln with the banner Mission Accomplished was one of the great errors in the press of fighting the war and it is skipped over here. I think Ari is right in saying that the press views any war that is long as a quagmire and Vietnam and any war where we win quickly is Desert Storm and must be over in a week. There is a lack of reality by the press which filters to the country.Overall an excellent book and very well done. Ari provides unique insight into the Bush White House and while it is biased it does not make it useless. He raises critical questions that require issues to be reexamined and while he is loathe to critize his former boss for the things he did wrong we still see a good look at Bush the man and the President.

Well needless to say if everything in this book can be believed then the world is turning out to be a scary place. I found this book to be very interesting and while I find some of it dubious the majority of it is very convincing. Perkins explains a job that can be seen in government and MNC's around the world. The desire and lust for power is endemic to society and Perkins job represents that better than one could imagine. I would recommend reading it but as Ronald Reagan put it "verify, then trust".

James Stewart delivers another knockout story in Disney War. The book which is relatively fair to all who are portrayed goes behind Disney to show the break down of the company between Roy Disney and Michael Eisner. Roy's pettiness and Eisner's arrogance are brought center stage. The book even gives you a glimpse of the insane genius that is Jeffery Katezenburg (at least at this point he is not complaining about a gay mafia). This is a must read for anyone studying the movie industry or Disney as a whole. It is a fair and balanced look inside one of America's best companies. In order to really understand this company far more will have to be exposed but this is a good start to what will be an interesting story when it is all told.

Glorious Cause does an excellent job of proposing a theory about the early years of the republic. America's struggle for independence was seen in the eyes of many as a cause to be one. It was pure and idealistic. Its values were entrenched in our battles and fighting spirit. While this book does focus quite a bit on the military content as others have pointed out it lives up to the series expectations. Overall this book conveys a sense of American history that is lost in most books talking about the revolution. We seem to want to study the revolution via biography and in doing so we lose sight of the big picture. This book serves to remind us of that picture and does so in a clear and direct way. Like almost every Oxford book it is clearly written and well researched. The bibliography here is a little more disappointing than the others in the series but is still thorough. The analysis of the revolution and the surrounding time period is as always top notch and deserves accolades for the masterful way in which it is presented. I would highly recommend this book for those who want to understand the American Revolution.

This book provides one of the few looks that we have of Hugo Chavez. His dictatorship in Venezuela is one of the more unique in the world especially when analyzing his power base. A word of caution when reading this book however is that Gott is fiercely anti-American so a lot of the book is taken up with his rabid viewpoints. It is still one of the best portraits we have of Chavez and if you can look past the anti-American bias the book is very useful. If you want to learn about modern Venezuela you really can't go wrong with this book.

This is an excellent biography of an American that few people know about. Fremont was truly a vivid member of history from the days of the early republic through the age of manifest destiny. This book covers not only Fremont's triumphs but his downfalls. While a young and impetuous (sometimes dishonest) man, Fremont was successful in helping to expand this countries knowledge of its own topography and boundaries. Through a vivid use of journals and maps Fremont led expeditions that cataloged the trails for westward expansion.His service in the army corp. of engineers helped with the capture of California through bravado more so than force. After his brief governorship of California, Fremont was found guilty at a court marital for his actions against General Kearny and the Polk administration. Fremont's retirement would lead him to business ventures and a run for the presidency as the Republican Party's first candidate. These distinctions would continue as he was a commander of the western union forces during the Civil War. His greatest act here would be to promote a little known Grant to general and command the armies of Tennessee. Overall this is an excellent biography and does a great job of providing a balanced look at a little known person in American history. Highly recommended for those who want to understand how the groundwork for manifest destiny was laid.

This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20. I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.

Microfinance is one of the newest strategies for development and Princeton economist Morduch takes a look at how it impacts societies. While he only looks briefly at the social issues he makes several compelling economic arguments for why we should consider microfinance as a viable option. The book is very well written although I think it does leave out some of the long term structural and institutional changes that need to be addressed. This is a field where new research comes out every day but Morduch's book is likely to be a staple for a very long time. This is a must have for anyone studying microfinance and will be for a long time to come.

IBM was a company that had begun to flounder after designing the first business computer. Louis Gerstner Jr. takes you inside his historic turnaround at IBM to show that culture can be changed. From not offering the high placed salaries to a culture where not everyone's job is secure were all remarkable to the folks at IBM. You really get an inside look at the company during his tenure and this book is invaluable if you are trying to study the computer industry.

The Mayflower provides an interesting look at one of the most interesting times in American History. While the discussion of the overseas voyage and early colonization is interesting the second half of the book is where the real action lies. The description of King Philips war and Indian relations is fascinating and shows an excellent template for the future of American history. Philbrick even handily deals with all of the actors involved and provides a very interesting viewpoint for further reading. If you know nothing about this time period as I did when I read this it is an excellent book to start with.

I was looking very forward to a guide for Philadelphia and this one met my expectations. The surrounding areas of Philadelphia are a little week and they glazed over a lot of things (especially in the state park and Pocono's category). The things for Delaware are very interesting and all great recommendations. The Jersey shore could have been more helpful but it is worth stopping by if you are on a trip here in the summer. Overall it is a useful book that would be very helpful if you are planning to go to Phili and see some of the surrounding area.

Chace presents an excellent account of an important election in American history. This was the most successful election for two parties outside of the main ones. The Democrats took the election with a victory for Woodrow Wilson but TR's progressive party and Debs socialist party polled amazing results given their standing. This book goes beyond the 1912 election and takes people through the world war showing what happened to each of these parties and the men. Debs life in particular was interesting and seeing the way in which the government reacted was indicative of the future. The book is very well written and worth taking the time to explore.

Talleyrand is possibly the most intriguing person to come out of the French Revolution. When he is not selling his services to the courts of Europe he is offering the Directory and Napoleon vital information as to how they should conduct foreign affairs. Cooper does a very good job of putting Talleyrand within the context of his times and makes diplomatic history come alive through his traitorous character. For those who understand the basics of the French Revolution and Napoleon this is a great book to expand their knowledge of how these events impacted Europe. If you are writing a diplomatic history this is an essential book that has to be understood. Cooper uses many of Talleyrands writing for his sources and gives the best impression available of the minister.

After reading this book one is forced to ask how did Andrew Jackson survive to be President. This is a page turner that I could not put down from the moment I started reading. It covers all aspects of the president's life and does an excellent job with the War of 1812. Jackson was present at many of the defining moments in post revolutionary history and was critical to bringing the people into politics. As the populist candidate you can see the reforms he brings about in some areas and the disasters he opens up in others. This is the best out of three biographies I have read on Jackson and I cannot imagine another one surpassing it. The attention to detail in covering all aspects of old Hickory's life is simply amazing and makes this a very useful book for those who know nothing about this time period. For those who have studied it this book will be an excellent summation and a great addition to any library.

Thomas Anderson is an excellent historian and his work here is of the highest quality. This book was published in 1982 so there are some holes that are not finished out but the analysis up until that point is excellent. For analysis on the region as a whole I would check out Ralph Lee Woodward's book, which Anderson praises, entitled Central America: A Nation Divided. Anderson looks at four countries in Central America including Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. Each of these is analyzed in its own internal policies and how they relate to the others and the rest of the world. Guatemala which is arguably the most stable of the group has an excellent economy and a government that keeps to honest elections with the exception of a few points in the 1970's. The book focuses on mostly the 1950-1980 time period in each of these countries. El Salvador is shown for the chaos that it is and is left with the civil war raging at the end of the chapter. Honduras is a simple case in Central America where US intervention has shaped the outcome of the country. It has the greatest wealth disparity of any country in Latin America. Finally Costa Rica is an interesting case with the Somoza's and Sandistas movement. The United States obviously will intervene here but it is interesting to see the analysis in a book that was written before that intervention. There are strong hints that intervention is necessary but it was not clear at that time that it would be done. Central America is a region that will need a great deal of internal improving and this book does an excellent job of showing where to start. It is very well written and an excellent place to start for learning about Central America.

Michael Dell tries to tell us how is company has been so successful and winds up writing an incredibly self serving biography even for a business man. It is so useless on information that it is amazing he got as many pages he did. Basically if you want to succeed in business you have to be brilliant like he is. While the direct to consumer model is very interesting his claim that he should be the sole possessor of it is ludicrous but what can you do. Read at your own risk.

Moscow 1812: Napoleons Fatal March by Adam ZamyoskiNapoleon's decision to attack Russia was one of two downfalls of his empire. This book explores that downfall in several different lights but hits upon two the most important ones that are worth mentioning. First and foremost Napoleon did not have the supplies or the understanding of the fight he was going into. Secondly he waited far to long in Moscow which had been practically burned to the ground. By the time he decided to leave it was too late. This book goes into the military, social and political implications of Napoleon's Fatal March and gives an excellent account of what happened there. The book is very well written and holds the readers interest. This really is a must have for a Napoleonic Library.

Part one of this yet unpublished trilogy is an excellent look at the War in Africa during World War 2. After reading this book you will ask yourself if we could actually win World War 2. The war was a disaster for American forces until almost the very end where a victory was made although most of the German forces had evacuated to Italy. This book shows the early Eisenhower strategy as well as the problems between the allies particularly Stalin v. Churchill and FDR. This book presents a tremendous amount of detail but keeps it easy to understand and makes it an enjoyable read. This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand world war 2. Even world war 2 buffs will find it interesting and will want to make it a part of their collection.

Louis Freeh provides an interesting look into the world of the FBI. The book takes an overview approach with specific vignettes of his time at the organization and how it evolved (or lack thereof) over the years. Freeh was director during a turbulent time when trust in the FBI was at a low and worked one of the toughest cases in its history with the Kohbar towers investigation. This investigation is the focal point of the book and done very well. He also covers a lot with the Bob Hansen treason as well as other stories. The main problem with the book is that it is light on details and the chapters often ramble on without focus. The book would have been better off from an organizational standpoint with shorter chapters more pointed towards the topics. I would like to have seen lesser stories but the ones told in greater detail. Overall it is a useful primary source but not the definitive history of his role in the FBI during those years.

The Chief is a well researched and excellent addition to the life of William Randolph Hearst who built the Hearst media empire. This is not a Hearst can do no wrong type of biography and strikes a very balanced tone in assessing the Chief's successes and his failures. There is excellent research done into his family life and how those relationships played out through his parents, his wife and his mistress. His role in newspaper publishing and Hollywood is discussed and for those who had any faith left in the press it will be shattered by the time you are done with this book. The yellow journalism of the Gilded Age and the political machines that were backed by the papers is a fascinating yet scary thing to read about. Don't be put off by the daunting number of pages in the book as it is a quick read and you actually feel as though you want more information in certain areas although given the lack available it is not possible. Overall a truly excellent book and well worth the time to read.

David Rock writes one of the most definitive accounts of Argentine history to date. His book dates from the Spanish colonization through the election of Alfonsin. He looks at the limited number of Spaniards that came to colonize Argentina and their effects on the buildup of Buenos Ares compared with the interior. There is only a little attention paid to the mission systems in the Chaco and other surrounding areas. (for more on the Chaco See The Chaco Mission Frontier by James Saeger). This book does provide an excellent overview of the countries history without going into too much depth. Economics is a major focus of the book as well as the politics of the peronist era. The Falklands conflict is one of the last major pieces covered and is done very well. This is a great book to get a bearing on Argentina's history and then decide where you want to read more. Whether you are a beginner or an expert this is an essential book for South American history.

Chances are you have never heard of Alfred Loomis before this book but you will not forget him once you have read it. This man is truly one of the most influential people in US history. A modern day renaissance man who made millions in the stock market before 1929 and was a genius scientist who developed modern radar technology. He established a lab at Tuxedo Park where he hosted scientists who would work on a variety of projects. While he was not directly connected to the Manhattan project many of the things worked on at his lab were eventually essential for the project. He worked closely with Vannavear Bush to bring over radar technology that would be invaluable for both sub hunting and eventually air defense in World War 2. This scientist even left his mark in World War 1 helping to develop new ways to fire artillery. If you want an interesting story this is the book for you.

Morris book takes a look at the early life of Theodore Roosevelt including his time with the rough riders. The first 350 pages of this book are boring. They categorize his early years at Harvard which seem very random and his courtship of his wife. It tracks his hopes and dreams and his time out west. TR is a random president who does not plan things out always and this book does reflect that. It is so random however that it is very difficult to see the significance of events that are included in those first 350 pages. What is done very well however, is the time with the rough riders, his reform days on the NYPD as president of the commission, and his time with the Navy. Here we see the TR that most of us envision. One of the things that Morris does very well is capture the spirit of the Gilded Age and the battle for Civil Service Reform. As a person who studies the Gilded Age he missed several key points but on the whole did a good job of capturing the spirit of the battle. TR was one of the reformers who made headlines thanks to the help of Jacob Riis and this partnership would have been nice to have explained further. The governorship and time back from the rough riders show TR as he is going to be. He is a scheming politician with a reformist attitude. While he awaits McKinley's decision on the VP he does some good in New York State when he can work with the legislature. The every end of the book comes about after the nomination to VP and McKinley's assignation. This is a very hard book to rate. The first 350 pages were among some of the worst I have ever read however the next 400 were very good and prize worthy. As such I will leave it at three stars but there could have been a lot more explained within this book.

The Texas Rangers are one of the most controversial forces in United States history. Charles Robinson does an excellent job of recounting their history. The rangers were founded after independence with an idea to police the state and provide border security. Their role would change throughout time and come to a peak during the Mexican Revolution. They would fight in the Mexican American war where they would particularly abuse the Mexican populations earning them a bad reputation with US forces. Despite their brutality they were among the best soldiers trained in scouting and commando tactics that US forces lacked. They were an early special forces that earned their reputation during the war. Their story of development is expertly recounted here. For those looking for an intro to Texas history this is a great place to start.

D'Souza does a decent job in his biography on the character of Reagan. My biggest complaint with this book is that it does not actually tell us anything about Reagan and his presidency. So much times is spent on the character that by the time you are done understanding Reagan's moral values the book is over and I felt I learned nothing about what Reagan did and how these values played out. For those who have really studied Reagan it is a great addition but if you are looking for only one book try Richard Reeves.

E. H. Carr provides an overview of international relations theory at a time when it was not a defined discipline. The real value of this book is seeing just how far sighted E. H. Carr was. The book itself is a basic overview of the tenants of international relations theory using the twenty years between the two wars as a case study. It looks primarily at the realist model but also brings in ethics and international law into his discussion. For those who are looking for an entertaining and fun read of IR Theory this is a great place to go. It has several updated introductions for the more serious scholar but Carr's work itself is a great study for those interested in IR and has a real love of it.

Hobsbawm takes a look at the age of revolution in Europe during the time frame of 1789-1848 and botches just about everything. He is so focused on Marxism that he misses almost all of the other aspects of these revolutions. You are so distracted by his Marxist overtones that you end up missing what he is talking about in most of the book. It is poorly written and if I had not had to read the book I would have stopped after the first twenty pages. Find anything else.

While this biography is very self serving it is a good look at an interesting company. With the rise of Krispy Kreme and starbucks it is easy to forget about the largest donut chain in the country. Rosenberg talks about his days and his focus as a coffee shop. To Dunkin donuts the donuts are simply a side business. This mentality is fascinating and for small business trying to decide on a mission this would be well worth reading. The book is fairly well written and it is hard to find books on this subject so if you are interested it is worth reading.

Trafalgar was a brutal conflict that changed the course of the wars on the continent. With the destruction of the French and Spanish fleet the British had control over the seas. This book talks about the prolonged conflict and the mission that Napoleon hoped to send his fleet on in order to deceive the British. Only Nelson's luck allowed the plot to unravel and the British to defeat the French. This is a good book once you have started to read about Trafalgar but I would not recommend starting with it. This book leaves out some events that occurred in the background but sheds new light on other aspects of the conflict. Overall it is well worth a read.

This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It takes the reader from 1814-1914 and walks through the conflict that embroiled central Asia for a century. It looks at how the British tried to defend their empire (notably India) by using proxies in Pakistan and Afghanistan. If you are wondering how the divisions are set up in the Middle East and central Asia today they are born during the Great Game. The book reads like a spy novel and is so well written you will not even notice you are reading history. The story takes you in and you wonder why there has not been a movie yet. It is amazing to see what these people went through and the things that were done in the line of duty for empire on both sides. Highly recommend and note that this is really part one of three of an official trilogy so make sure you see the other great books on the Great Game

This is an interesting book about the life of Conrad Hilton. It talks a little bit about the early days of the hotel chain starting and extols hard work and virtue. Overall I would have liked to have known more about the hotel challenges especially in the post world war 2 era. He does an excellent job of talking about how he built his chain during the depression in rural southwest America. His early invention of the motel was crucial and although he switched to higher end operations I think he had a glimpse of the future. Overall the book was interesting but just did not cover what I had hoped.

JB Kelly provides an excellent overview of Middle East relations with the United States during the 1960's and 1970's. Although written before the fall of the Shah it still is a valuable contribution to the scholarship of the Middle East. It is one of the few books that really provides a close look at how the Arabian peninsula developed with Saudi Arabia and the smaller territories. This followed the British withdraw from the peninsula with most notably the transformation of Aden. For those who are studying the Middle East this is a great starting point to have a historical handle on how the problems developed pre 1979. Kelly is one of the foremost political experts in the area and the fact that this was primarily a British zone of influence for most of this time makes his view as a brit all the more valuable. Overall an excellent addition to the scholarship and still worth a look even today.

James Chace delivers another great biography of a pivotal figure after World War II in his look at Dean Acheson who served as Truman's Secretary of State and played a pivotal role in developing American foreign policy during the Cold War. When one refers to Cold War warriors the list has to include someone like Acheson whose belief that the Soviets would only respect those who stood up to them. This drove American foreign policy towards fighting in career, standing against aggression in Berlin and laying the groundwork for fights across the world. He would provide advice to Kennedy during the missile crisis as part of Ex-Com and even to Presidents LBJ and Nixon on various foreign policy initiatives. While he would travel all over the world his main area of focus was always Germany and Europe as one of the key developers of the Marshall Plan and the NATO alliance. This book also looks at Acheson's life and education through the elite schools of the northeast and how that affected his world view and drove those on the communist witch hunt to oppose him. Overall this weaves a fascinating story that is very detailed through some of the pivotal moments of the cold war. For those readers who are looking for new insights into the cold war you will not find them here but you will find an excellent look at how this Secretary of State shaped Cold War policy and conceptualized the Cold War through the realist lens. It is well done and interesting to read for those who are looking for another perspective on the Cold War.

The battle of Trafalgar sunk the French hope of an invasion of Britain and deprived the British of their greatest hero. This book outlines the battle as well as looking at the significance of what happened afterwards. The legacy of Nelson is discussed and his impact on Britain as well as looking at the aftermath of the French and Spanish fleet. The failed invasion of the channel is also talked about. For those looking for a book on Trafalgar this is a great one to start with.

David Halberstam delivers another masterpiece in his book on how the Balkan crisis came about. This book is very fair condemning Bush Sr, Clinotn and all of the generals including Colin Powell for their actions in this area. The United States dropped the ball in stabilizing this region leaving it to the European Union to debate about. Our unwillingness to commit troops has led to more than a decade of crisis and halberstam delivers the story in great detail. Highly recommend if you are just starting to learn about the crisis as it is a very fair and well written account.

This book provides a succinct and relevant history of two important countries in South America. Venezuela covers the early years of Indian expansion and the Spanish conquistadors who changed the face of the country. Race relations between the Spaniards and the creoles were sharp in both countries and the rise of Bolivar would bring about independence. Venezuela would fall under the sway of military dictatorships eventually being supplanted by democracies. These democracies would be tenuous and the military would suppress the growth of liberalism through their numerous interventions. Columbia was a complex situation between liberals and conservatives. The liberals held power more often than the conservatives but the social, political and economic realities of the country were shaped by the interplay with each. While this book stops in 1960 it provides an excellent look at the countries history.

What the Dormouse Said is an attempt to try and tell how the personal computer developed out of the 1960's counterculture. Sadly the author becomes so fixated on one person that he misses his chance to tell the great story. No author has yet to be able to capture the development of the personal computer but this book does have most of the salient elements. From the development of the ARPA net to the IBM 650 we can see the computer industry cloacae. The need for the killer app or the internet is apparent but the attempts to link this all to one visionary who was not even involved in decision making or work on these projects is pitiful. Doug Engelbert was not even around for the roll out of Xerox's computer or the Altair craze that ended with the distribution of Gates software. This book gets two starts for the fact that it has all of the pieces there but loses the rest for being unable to connect them. Hopefully someone will finally tell this story someday.

This book provides a thorough account of the colonial affects that India went through to shape is modern economy. The first two chapters are broken up into agricultural development of the period and the industrial development of the period. It clearly shows that there was subsistence agriculture but industrial scale was struggled to be achieved. This book is very fine economic analysis and while having the common methods of econometrics it does not become bogged down in them so it can be understood by those without a mathematical background. If you do have one though you will find some extra goodies within the book. The last chapter looks at how the countries economy developed between the 1920's to the 1970's and focuses on the struggles India faced once it was free of colonial domination. Overall this is a very thorough account and one worth taking a look at if you are interested in colonial India.

This is a decent urban history book that covers the reasons for the movement of people from the east to the west coast. It follows the baseball team the dodgers as they decide to get out of New York and head to Los Angeles. It understands the significance of the automobile and the attraction in the post world war 2 era to move towards the west coast. The widespread use of the airplane makes it possible for teams to head out that far so that they can travel. This is a light read that is very well done and is good for either fans of sports or urban history.

109 East Palace provides a succinct account of how the a city of Los Alamos came about and how through that city the atom bomb was developed. The story of the atom bomb is one of the most fascinating in history from all points of view (history, military, science, political) and there is no doubt that Richard Rhodes provides the definitive account on the matter. What I find refreshing about Connat's book is that it takes a more humanistic view and shows how the people working on the bomb were affected. From family planning, to living conditions, to simple things like entertainment in a city that is not supposed to exist all are covered well here. Connat relies on extensive interviews and access to Dorothy McKibbens memoirs. Dorothy was the main contact for the outside world with Los Alamos. She ran her operations out of 109 East Palace in Santa Fe and provided the community with whatever she could find. The story of how she did this and what allowed Oppenhiemer and his team to succeed are where this book outshines others describing the development of the atom bomb. It is a very light read filled with fascinating stories from an insider perspective and very well written. For those looking to add to their knowledge of this amazing historical event this is a book that cannot be missed.

Paul Kengor's book is an interesting look at the Reagan legacy with regards to foreign policy. While a Reagan booster and fan of the president I think this book goes to far in asserting what Reagan knew about the downfall of the Soviet Union. Underscored in the Kengor's points is one key difference the Reagan often does not get enough credit for which is that Reagan was the first president who believed the Soviet Union could be defeated. To say however that he came in with a plan to destroy the evil empire is a little far fetched. Overall though Kengor's points are well illustrated and he ties together a thematic view of Ronald Reagan upon the lens of foreign policy. I think the reviewer who puts this between David McCullough and Sean Hannity has it in the exact right place for where it falls in the historical spectrum. While they are more detailed book son Reagan (see Richard Reeves) the are also ones that are unabashed praise which is a bad thing regardless of your political persuasion (see D'souza). For those who want to get a quick overview of Reagan's efforts in foreign policy this is a great place to start.

Thunder Out of China provides a look at China as it transitioned from the Kuomintang government to communism following World War II. The book takes the reader through Theodore White's perspective (who was a journalist stationed in China at the time) on why the Kuomintang fell and the corruption that led to their fall. It is very detailed and provides a unique perspective of China that few are able to provide at that time. He looks at the peasants, the military the political leadership of both the Kuomintang and the Communists as well as the efforts of the United States State Department and Military who helped to preserve the leadership of the Kuomintang. It is a very quick read for those who want a perspective on what occurred form someone who lived it at the time. While not all encompassing it does provide a primary source for the fall of China.

Jeffreys does an excellent job of tracing the development of this modern wonder drug and making it accessible to the average reader. While medically and scientifically complex, Aspirin, proved that simple trial and error of the old ways developed modern medicines. Long before the days of clinical trials physicians trusted their instincts and networked together to bring about medicines. Would Aspirin pass an FDA trial today? Doubtful given the stringent requirements but as this book traces through its history we can see the benefits of trying the drug. Part business history, part history of technology, and part social history Jeffrey's thoroughly researched work provides us with the accurate account of how this drug came about. The author points out that he is not a clinician and tries to stick to the historical facts doing an excellent job the entire way through. Overall very well done and an interesting book for those interested in the history of medical technology and science.

The transistor is essential to modern life in America. Without its development I would not have been able to leave this review today. This is a look at how it developed and how it led to the start of the modern computer. My one complaint about this book is that it becomes far too bogged down in scientific jargon and lost the social history as it did so. The business discussion is mediocre at best especially given the delicate relations that occurred to fight over this chip. A much needed book but executed poorly.

Noriega was one of the most controversial figures in Latin America. Sosa fought against Noriega and worked with the United States to bring him down. After being forced out of the embassy by Noriega Sosa would be one of the key figures to brining about his downfall. If you want an insiders look from someone who was involved this is a great start. If you are only learning about Noriega for the first time it can be a little daunting since this book does assume some knowledge of the affair. Overall though this book is worth your time to read.

The third installment of the years of Lyndon Johnson takes readers deeper into his character and reveals an interesting time in United States history. The first 100 pages of this book are an overview of the Senate's history and Caro tries to show how tradition bound the Senate is. Lyndon Johnson's battles and dominance over men are shown once again and this time he appears a little more likeable. Johnson is still cold and calculating and hard to like but he is looking more human. His stance on civil rights is purely political but you can see some compassion when he feels groups are mistreated. The battles of the South, west, and northern liberals in his own party are fascinating to read about. Caro has as always done his homework and his efforts to show you how even a simple water rights bill impact civil rights are well illustrated. It is over 1000 pages of readable material so this is not for the faint of heart. If you do undertake to read the book however you will not be disappointed. LBJ's hopes at the 1956 convention are dashed when the convention nominates Stevenson yet again and he is unable to secure the VP post. This book ends before the 1960 convention but does show his last year's in the Senate where LBJ returns to his old ways of dominating men. Overall this was an excellent book and very enjoyable.

Gregory Gause delivers a book that will no doubt be a classic study on the political characteristics of oil monarchies and the ways in which these r&eacute;gimes maintain power despite the ongoing processes towards modernity. The sheer volume of money in which these r&eacute;gimes have access to combine with in some cases a small domestic population (relying on foreign workers for the heavy lifting) gives them a tremendous advantage in maintain power. In all of the countries surveyed (Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar) relationships had been developed through spiritual control and tribal relationships making normal political participation a much smaller scale than a standard republic. For those looking to gain an understanding of the political structure of the Middle East this is a great place to start and well worth the time to read.

Stanley Payne provides one of the most thorough and accurate overviews of Fascism in this book. The biggest problem with much of the fascist literature is that it combines fascism and Nazism into one category when in fact they are quite different. Payne grasps these nuances quite well and shows the nature and development of each. He tracks not only the rise of fascism in Italy but across Europe and the world. It looks at the failed movements in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe and the budding movements of the Middle East and the crushing defeats of fascism in Asia. The book is well written and thoroughly covered with an excellent bibliography for further study. All and all a great overview of fascism and one not to be missed.

This is a difficult book on the French Revolution. Lynn Hunt is a brilliant historian who takes European intellectual history and fashions it to understand what was going on in the French Revolution. I will guarantee this is a book to be read at least twice because the first time through you will be very overwhelmed (unless you have a very good knowledge in enlightenment philosophers) and you will need time to assess her ideas. The basics include the nation of France was the same dynamic as a family and the roman ace required the restitution of the family in order to make the country whole. Hunt does not take her theory far enough in the end to include Napoleon as the new father in her reconstituted family but otherwise it is a very interesting analysis. This is not a book for beginners but for those studying the French Revolution they may find it useful. Be warned if you see it on your syllabus make sure you leave time to read it several times over.

Walter Stahr provides an excellent look at this often forgotten founding father. Jay was the lawyer of his day serving on the New York Supreme court and eventually first chief Justice of the US Supreme court. He would be called on several occasions to serve his country and always did so with distinction. He was president of the Continental Congress and served at a time to help relieve the supply situation that was plaguing Washington at Valley Forge. In his career he was also sent to Spain as our ambassador and while accomplishing little there found himself in the right place at the right time to attend the peace commission with Franklin and Adams. I have read many books on the peace convention but Stahr does an excellent job of giving fascinating tidbits about the negotiations and why the positions existed.Of all the revolutionary biographies I have read this is one of the few that really goes into the intricacies of the peace process and what the major sticking points of the treaty were. It provides new and valuable insight into process and really sees the foundation for how the international system looked following the Revolution. Jay's service as secretary of state at times left him the sole architect of the United States future given the lack of quorum and general disagreement of congress. Following the United States constitution which Jay helped to write several Federalist papers the tide would again change for Jay.John Jay would become the nations first Chief Justice and help define two unique roles of the court. The first would be as an advisor to the president on interpreting international treaties and their significance to US law. He would also help define the circuit riding which he thought should not be part of the courts duties. He would only leave the court to travel as a special envoy to England in order to negotiate a treaty to avoid a war in 1794. Finally retiring from the court to become governor of New York during a pivotal time as the state transformed itself. Overall his life hangs in the background of the founding fathers but without him many of their great deeds could not have been accomplished. This is a fascinating biography to read for those who want to see the behind the scenes activities of the American Revolution.

James Patterson delivers an excellent biography of Robert Taft which categorizes the Republican Party during his involvement. Taft was aptly named Mr. Republican by those around him because of his consistent desire to work within the republican machine. Making three attempts for President he proved unable to do what his father had. Taft's run in 1940 was foiled by Wilkie who captured a war hawk vote. Taft himself was very isolationist and did not want to become involved in a war with Germany and thought both the UN and NATO were wrong. A staunch anti-New Dealer, Taft proved to be an irrevocable foe of the FDR administration opposing the socialist tendency's of the program. Taft's start as a state representative and senator in Ohio showed he was not completely against social programs but they were only to be taken in moderation and the idea of higher taxes was against his core beliefs.Taft found himself again defeated in 1948 when Dewey took the presidential race and ultimately lost to Truman. At the end of the race Dewey's power in the party was sapped and Taft became the clear candidate for the next leg of the race. Taft himself became boiled down in trying to restrain but not divide the party over McCarthy's trials. When 1952 rolled around Taft polled well against Eisenhower but at the end was unable to overtake the general's popularity. While a VP slot was considered Eisenhower wanted someone younger and Taft came in as majority leader in the Senate. Using his influence there he was able to deliver several bills for Eisenhower and try to uphold his unpopular Taft-Hartley act.This biography does an excellent job of explaining these events and putting them into the context of political history at the time. Robert Taft was one of the more powerful republicans of his day and did an excellent job of upholding party unity in the face of splintering opinions. For those looking for a different perspective on the World War II and early cold War era this cannot be beat. Patterson is in the top of his field and this book delivers as his always do. I highly recommend it for those interested in modern American history.

The peace conference at Munich where central Europe was given to Hitler has been shrouded in history with very few books actually covering only the conference itself. One of the earliest attempts written in the first five years after the war is the book we have here. It is a thorough analysis of what happened at this conference that led to war. It is by no means the most current work on the subject but is one of the better books for "telling the story" of what happened at the peace conference. It is a little weak on the role that Italy played in bringing the conference about and suffers from its mostly British focus. Despite these it is a good start for those who want to learn more about the peace conference and the years leading up to it.

Robert Goldberg provides an excellent and balanced look at the life and legacy of Barry Goldwater in his biography that is becoming the standard for those wanting to learn more about the man who shaped the modern conservative party. From Arizona senator to presidential hopeful to conservative icon Barry Goldwater's career was shaped by his viewpoints on limited government, military power and a strict interpretation of the constitution (until later in his career on the last one). Goldberg takes a wonderful look at the elections, the debates and the bills that shaped Goldwater's viewpoints and articulates the salient information for learning more about the man. It is an easy read and one that is filled with great information about a conservative icon.One of the most striking things learned about Goldwater is that he perfected the grassroots efforts of a modern politician combined with the stumping of a politician from the 1880's which plays well in his local politics but not well on the national scene. Goldwater's policies on Vietnam and Civil Rights are assessed in the book and while the author seems to get on a soapbox for part of the time he covers the legislation aspect adequately. Given how hard it is to find any book on Goldwater that is not biased one way or the other this remains the most balanced I have seen and I would recommend as the one to read.

This book lives up to its series title. The Treaty of 1763 was the start of the American nation. The fall out of the treaty created several events that would lead to the revolution. From rising taxes to the Proclamation of 1763 the colonists were being given ample reasons to rise up. Calloway who is a Native American historian focuses on the rise of the Indians especially Pontiac's rebellion near Detroit. He provides a condemnation of Francis Parkman who virtually ignores the Indians in his account of the 7 years war. Overall if you are looking for a book that explains why the American Revolution began this is an excellent place to start and arguably the most pivotal moment in our history as it started the creation of the United States.

This is an older account of how San Domingo became Haiti and the rode to freedom from slavery. Be warned it carries a Marxist slant throughout the whole book but once you ignore that then the story is very compelling. It is one of the best accounts of what happened on San Domingo and you get a sense for how the French Revolution influenced what was happening the Caribbean. If you are just starting out on Caribbean history this is the perfect book to start with. It shows how the cultural identity began to take shape and what happened to the French Caribbean possessions.

Another great installment in the Pivotal moments of American history. I think one of the great triumphs of this book is the explanation as to why this is a more important battle than Gettysburg. This book takes into consideration all of the international factors that went into the significance of the battle. It clearly provides a discussion of what happened and with the pictures and diagrams provided you get a very vivid picture of one of the bloodiest battles in the Civil War. This is an excellent book for civil war buffs and a must have for a civil war library. James McPhereson continues his streak of developing excellent and thoughtful civil war novels.

This is the absolute best business book I have ever read. It tracks no only McDonalds but other fast food companies as well. It gives a good sense of the history of the industry as well as possible future trends. You can see the development of McDonalds for what it is an compare it to others. This book also confirms much of Ray Kroc's account so if you are looking for just the McDonald's story that is an okay substitute. The depth and perspective of this book though cannot be beat. It is very well written and just an excellent source of information on the fast food industry.

There are few people who would find the Gilded Age a fascinating time to read about but if you are one of them this biography is perfect. If you are curious about the only honest politician during that era then this is the book for you. Although elected to two terms (non consecutively) see how this democrat filled in the shoes of a largely republican era. This is by far the best biography of Cleveland in print and while some may be turned off by his politicking at the time they fail to realize it was simply the way of things. Cleveland played the political game as honestly as he could and did an excellent job in doing so. Fascinating story about an interesting time in our political history.

Behind the Frontier offers a look at the fall of the Indian nations in Eastern Massachusetts during the mid to late 1700's as white settlers encroached on their land and assimilated them into their cultures. Mandell talks a look at a wide range of factors from trade, war, disease, intermarriage, and legal conflicts that changed the tribes in the area reducing their traditional way of living to nothing and showing how they melded in with the culture. These tribes did not disappear in the traditional sense but lived on behind the frontier by assimilating into societies including Boston. This book does work well to dismiss the general myth that Indians simply were wiped out after King Philips War. It is a very specific topic and one needs to be very interested in Indian history of New England or you will quickly find this a dry book. I have a general interest in colonial history and found parts of this to be very slow at times. One thing Mandell does not do well is outline where each of the Indian tribes is living. This book assumes a lot of knowledge about the geography of New England which I did not have as a reader. There is not a single map to give you a frame of reference so be prepared to research online to follow along. Overall a very strong book analytically, but only if you have some background knowledge in New England colonial history.

If you are looking for a book that can cover colonial life, the war for impedance, the peace treaty that ended the war and the presidencies that followed this is a great place to start. While a bit daunting in length I found myself sailing through this book and enjoying every page. Whether Adams is abroad or in the presidency you get a clear picture of not only the man but the times he lived in. This is among my favorites of McCullough's books and is essential to any American Revolution library.

AOL Time Warner has been one of the most disastrous mergers of the century but it had the glimpse of the future in it. Overpriced AOL used to stock to buy a company with tons of equity but a low stock price. AOL sought the content of Time Warner to drive their website and failing business which was stemming from lack of content. When the tech bubble burst Time Warner was left holding a virtually useless company. The battle of egos and more realistically the collapse of AOL left this company in desperate shape. This is a great start to understanding how the company failed. It also is instructive in showing what search engines need to do. They need to get content and give people a reason to search AOL over Yahoo over Google or the other way around. The struggle for content is well shown here and is worth further consideration.

This is one of the best biographies on the not only the life of James Monroe but on the development of the United States role in world affairs. The author clearly assesses not only the role that Monroe played but also the exogenous factors that led to the development of the country. By framing this through Monroe's life we can clearly see his development along with that of the country at clear and critical junctures. From the early days of the revolution to the diplomacy of Europe to his time as governor of Virginia Monroe clearly shaped the outcome of the United States. While not the philosopher that Jefferson or Madison was the legal theories and common sense diplomacy espoused by Monroe was necessary to set the path for growth that the country needed in the early eighteenth century.Overall it is a thoroughly enjoyable read that will answer the questions of those wondering how the identity of the nation was formed.

John Tolland's book is an excellent review of Japanese history in the World War II period of 1936-1945. it is a wonderful addition to the modern war library and conveys not only a great perspective on Japan but world politics at the time. It is very detailed on the significance of battles and key details. This is not a blow by blow summary of the war but a big picture look at how the pacific unfolded and the Japanese empire fell apart. The deep scar this left on the Japanese nation is apparent and the alien nature of Japanese culture to Americans is really well displayed. If you are just starting out on learning about Japan and World War II this really is the best book to start with.

The Global Studies series is a great way to get a general overview about a region of the world and its quick history. Each country is divided up into a quick overview of demographics, trade, economics, population and other pertinent data similar to a scaled down CIA world fact book. There is then a general overview of each country and how it has played its part in the region with a particular focus on World War II to the present. Finally there are about 24 articles in this one that focus on all sorts of different aspects from the region. They address everything from gambling opportunities in Macau to population control in Japan. Overall this book does an excellent job of capturing the Pacific Rim and the countries that reside there. It is a great start to learning about the region and provides an overview that will give you a focus to direct further investigations. If you are just getting started on this area of the world as I am you will find it an invaluable resource.

Trump has written many books and I think this is one of his more disappointing efforts. The book contains many great tips that can be gotten out of any run of the mill business book. It lacks the Trump style of straight talk and is really Donald showing his ego on most of the pages. Stick to Art of the Deal if you want to see classic Trump giving good original advice. If you are a fan of the Donald though you won't find this book to disappointing.

The history of the British Navy is a fascinating subject and this book is an excellent start. NAM Rodger is doing the masterpiece work but it is still not complete and only two volumes are out so this book fills in during the meantime. The writing is very good and it covers Britain from the days of the Vikings through the Falklands. Drakes raids are very well covered and make for one of the most interesting parts of the book. For a one book summary of British Naval History this cannot be beat.

The early days of the American republic were categorized not by the "American system of mass production" but by determined entrepreneurs who made skilled use of workers. Hounshell tracks several industries including woodworking, International Harvester, Singer Sewing machines and gun manufacturing showing how scale and interchangeable parts came into existence. The first half of his book tries to dispel the myth of the American System of manufacturing and provides great technical insight into each of the industries mentioned above.The second half looks at how the principles of mass production were applied. Particular attention is paid to Pope bicycles which were among the first items mass produced. You can clearly see how technology built upon one another to form the mass production we know today. The last three chapters of the book focus mostly on Ford and their production models from the Model T to the Model A. Some attention is given to GM and their efforts to undermine the cheap characteristics of Ford and create the car industry as we know it today. It considers the idea of mass production and debates what Ford really did create.The book does an excellent job of looking at how industries progressed over a long period of time and while getting lost in the details it does come through. There is some thick description were the technological explanation is more than someone would want to know but mostly it is good solid information. This is a great book for those who are just beginning to study the history of technology or for the experts.

Dani Rodrik tackles the issue on the state of Globalization for the institute for international economics think tank with surprising insight and intellectual power. This is a great look from an economists prospective (graphs and data analysis included) on where globalization is today. This is not a tired rehashing of long discussed topics but a fresh take on where globalization is today. The book begins by looking at where the labor market is and assessing the consequences for unskilled labor and the elasticity of demand for workers as the curve flattens with increased globalization of the workforce. It is followed by tension in trade and domestic policy from child labor to fair trade and the strikes of workers as globalization increases. One of the more interesting chapters is the argument hat with the increase in globalization the demand for social insurance rose and with the diminishing tax base is now one of the cruxes that is poised to cause potential harm within the world economic order. Mobile capital has shifted tax bases and is putting strain on government budgets to meet the demands of its citizens. Overall an excellent addition to the issues on globalization and one that is not to be missed.

The No Frills sector of airlines is revolutionizing the way airlines do business. Simon Calder does an excellent job of exploring this trend in both Europe and the United States. If you are not somewhat familiar with European airlines and the difference between No Frills, flag carriers, and majors than you may want to read some other books before coming to this one. If you are somewhat knowledgeable though this is a great book to start with. Very well written and covers things in exhausting detail. The analysis is top notch and this book is essential for anyone studying the airline industry.

This is truly one of the greatest books on the Post World War 1 and how it developed into World War 2. This book goes section by section through the world and talks about the effects of peace on the east, Middle East, Africa, and Europe. It redraws the borders, shows the alienation of Italy as well as the harshness of German reparations. The failure of the League of Nations is coached in this treaty and these six months were a catastrophe for the world. It is done in amazing detail. This is an essential book for any World War 1 or World War 2 historian.

In the Name of War is a revisionist interpretation of King Philips War. This is not a history of the war and provides an example of how the colonists at the time interpreted various aspects of the war. From seizing of colonists to selling Indians into slavery the effects of the war were traced throughout the war period. The brutality of the war is captured through the narrative that she lays out but in the end you really have to be interested in the time period to get something out of it. Like many things written about Indians there is a general feeling that the author must apologize for not being an Indian writing about Indians and that comes through in this book. In the end it is lackluster and boring with little for those looking for a history of the war.

The Reckoning is a wonderful book that shows how the United States lost its dominance in the automobile industry. In true Halberstam fashion MacNamara is one of the main villains but through stunning research Halberstam paints a very clear picture of what happened. Japans attention to detail and innovation overshadow America's downfall. The big three are unable to respond and those who are running the Japanese business in the United States who were far more inventive. This book is still relevant even in today's world.

Nathan Miller provides a refreshing narrative of FDR in his book an Intimate Life. Overall while there are some inaccuracies that other historians later disproved the views espoused here are sound and look at a different aspect than many FDR biographies do. Particularly with regard to Roosevelt's rise to power and his elections with his inner circle are detailed and thoughtfully discussed. While some may find the detail of his early life tiring it does do a lot to shape who he is as a person and provide insight into his later actions. In fact this is one of the best looks at Roosevelt as a person without elevating him to the godlike status that so many biographers do. If you are looking for a quick overview that looks at Roosevelt as a person and not just his time as president this is a good place to start but discount much of the Eleanor pages since that has largely been disproved.

The war of the Triple Alliance is the only true war involving Latin American countries. The efforts of Francisco Solano Lopez to expand his territory are truly nefarious and Leuchars does an excellent job of showing how Paraguay was dragged into war by a dictator. He shows how one man willed his countries power against Brazil and Argentina the superpowers of Latin America. This book is a great microcosm of how one dictator was able to challenge two super powers and bring them to the point of exhaustion. The battles were truly amazing and Leuchars provides the best account to date on the fight. Highly recommend for those interested in Latin America.

John Mearshieimer presents an excellent theory in the form of offensive realism that stands up to close scrutiny in his book the Tragedy of Great Power Politics. By clearly laying out his definitions of what state goals are and how he measures power he makes a compelling case for regional hegemony and the stopping power of water. By utilizing several case studies to prove his theory the points are well made. His analysis of military power is very interesting and well done.It is hard to find good realist IR theory these days as so many people doubt that such a system is relevant in a post cold war world. Mearshiemer makes one of the better cases for it existing today and for categorizing the state of anarchy that exists in the world. He rightly recognizes that the potential for great power conflict is not likely in Europe and the Russia is to weak to invade there. His characterization of Asia is very strong and the possible conflict between China and the US is clearly analyzed and presented.My only criticisms and they were not enough to drop the book down a star was that Africa and the Middle East was virtually ignored. Resource conflict is a major potential area of violence in the future and much of this focused on technological or military threats leaving out the recent prospects of resource conflict. By looking at a regional system these areas should have been included. Overall though excellent realist theory and a very enjoyable read.

Jack Welch is of course a business genius and has written many books. This is the only one that recounts what he did at GE to make it a successful company. I think it is the most interesting of all of his books and by far the most fun to read. No matter what type of business you own or are interested in there is something in here for everyone. You get a great sense of what running a conglomerate looks like. Highly recommend.

William Russell does an excellent job of setting the stage for Nazi oppression with his inside account of his days in the US embassy at the outbreak of the war. The first few pages draw the reader in with his discussion of the immigration desk and the sheer volume that were trying to escape the oppressive regime. The account that Russell provides of the regime trend from the absurd to the truly shocking and give a perspective that is hard to find. He provides an account that is a truly invaluable primary resource for historians. For those who want to learn a little about the chaotic nature of diplomacy and the life of diplomats it is a great portrait. This book does an excellent job of portraying life in Germany in 1939 and 1940. It is scattered around and the organization at times may not make sense but its value as a primary account overrides those flaws. The insight that Russell provides on the German people and the way that Americans and others saw them in the world is fantastic. The view of Hitler and the SS/propaganda machine shows just what the state looked like. While people like William Shrier were trying to tell a journalistic story (which is also a wonderful source and should not be discounted) this book gives great insight into the times. Very easy to read and a wonderful contribution to our literature.

The 500 cup cakes provides 125 recipes for a variety of cup cakes from everyday use to special occasions. Each of the 125 recipes has four minor variations that tweak the item into a different version by adding a new flavor profile. Overall it is an average cookbook but for those who are skilled in baking like my wife it provides base recipes that can then be used to make their own variations while using this as a widespread springboard and because the recipes are chosen for easy variations they lend themselves to creating your own as well. We have only found a few recipes to be a little vague on the directions but overall have not had too many problems with this book. Overall well recommended for those that are looking for a lot of cake recipes that can be built on.

This book is a masterful retelling of how Milken and his partners defrauded billions of dollars around the world. It tracks how these rings started and how the FBI, SEC, Interpol and others worked to close them. The arrogance of these men was amazing and their ability to defraud is unmatched. This story is one that has to be read and retold. Highly recommend.

It stays very focused and covers how the middle east coalition went to war with Israel. The stunning defeat by this coalition was shocking to the world and is clearly explained in this book. Easily five stars and very well done. This is a good book for those who know a lot about the Middle East or those who are just starting. If you want to understand the Middle East conflict this is an essential book to have.

This book is one of the most thorough firsthand accounts of the Kennedy administration and takes an almost exhaustive look at many of the things that occurred during the administration. While some of the conclusions have been tempered with history and new evidence coming to light (particularly on the Bay of Pigs and the Civil Rights record) this is still considered the definitive book on the Kennedy years in the white house and should deserve that distinction. Schlesinger who served as a special advisor to the president (much like Ken O'Donnell of Thirteen Days fame) provides a unique view to a complicated man, politician, and president. Kennedy offered hope to a generation of Americans and by extension to many people of the world. He was firm yet promised compassion through his negotiations with the Soviets, Peace Corps and commitment to Civil Rights.While there are a few points in the book where Schlesinger props up his own importance at a particular point and digresses for about 50 pages or so the remainder of the book is very spot on with what was occurring, why decisions were made and what the effects of those decisions were. Sadly Schlesinger was not as involved in the Executive Committee (Ex-Com) as other special assistants were so much of what has happened at that point was not related in this book and the role that the committee played is kept to almost a minimum. I will point out that even as a Republican I found the book fair and while lacking in detail at some points it is still the most complete work that is published on Kennedy and to those who claim bias: the man worked in the Kennedy administration so take that bias into account as you read and enjoy a firsthand look at a complicated presidency and pivotal point in American history. Overall well worth the time to read.

Manfred Steger provides a different look at Globalization in the Very Short Introduction series by Oxford University Press. This series provides a quick overview of topics and addresses their veracity as a theory and provides a critical eye towards the controversies in each topic. I will say that I was disappointed in this particular entry into the series which seemed to be far more critical towards globalization and spent more time on the flaws than addressing a fair and balanced look at the series. His book is broken down into key components of globalization including historical, cultural, economic, ideological, political, and cultural aspects and then he looks at some of the issues of globalization. The aspects chapters are done fairly well, although there is a distinct Marxist bias when you look at the sources in the economic chapter, showing how each of these facets impacts globalization. One of the strengths of the book is that a multidisciplinary approach is evident in Steger's approach showing how complex the discipline is. It was in the last chapter where I was disappointed and felt a strong bias towards anti-globalization forces. The author would present several quotes or facts about one of the issues and then pick the weakest one and tear it apart without really addressing the other two. There is also a championing of anti globalization forces in the forms of Ralph Nader and WTO protesters in Seattle. I will admit that I am reading the 2003 version and thought it was way to early to call anything about the Iraq war and its effect on diminishing globalization by sowing global discontent and further Islam backlash so perhaps the newer version puts this into a more appropriate context. Overall an interesting book and worth time in the pantheon of globalization literature but its bias should be taken into account.

This is an interesting book about the history of the Morgan family. It tends to drag on and is not as good as Chernow's other books about finance (notably Hamilton). I was expecting quite a bit more on JP Morgan and the book did not deliver in that way. Despite those two flaws the book is filled with such good information and is so well organized that it still deserves five stars I would just know you are not buying a book solely or even focusing on JP Morgan.

Joseph Ellis provides a very good biography of Thomas Jefferson and the contradictions in his nature. This book is not meant to be a day by day account of Jefferson's life but a look at the times when Jefferson's thoughts were forming and how those conclusions were reached. The book does jump around quite a bit and leaves out some years that I think the reader would like to know which is the main reason for the four stars instead of five. While Ellis shows how American's have misunderstood Thomas Jefferson he spends a lot of time trying to justify Jefferson's decisions that we clearly have little historical evidence for. Jefferson may remain one of our least understood figures and Ellis approach tries to summarize what we conclusively know without taking too many liberties. The legacy of Thomas Jefferson takes up almost the final 50 pages of the book and Ellis explores how current philosophers and historians are trying to interpret the messages Thomas Jefferson left behind. Much of this philosophy is based upon letters exchanged between Adams and Jefferson after they made peace. The surprising contradictions of Jefferson's character lead the reader to still have an air of mystery even after reading this book. There is little doubt of the man's political genius and this is a must read for fans of the American Revolution, political philosophy or the early republic. It puts a lot of things in perspective and while I wish it had covered more areas it does a wonderful job of those that it does.

This was one of the best textbooks I have read in college. It covers most of the major wars post world war 2 and gives the history leading up to them. You can see a clear dichotomy where the major power in the world leading up to the conflict causes the conflict through foolish colonization policies. Mostly British for the first half and then the United States. It is a good summary overall and is a must have for any student in International Relations or military history. It is a well written and quick read. 5 stars.

Flying high tells the story of David Neeleman the founder of JetBlue and one of the most successful CEO's in aviation history. Neeleman is noted for delivering a high service, low cost airline that operates with the principles of southwest and the perks of the best in the industry. He does this by leveraging technology and his crewmembers to gain strategic advantages in the market. From ticketless reservation systems to strategic airport choices he has turned JetBlue into a premium service airline. From his experience in starting travel agencies and even another smaller airline named Morris Air the reader gets a clear view into some of the most interesting stories in airline history.As some other reviewers have noted this book does not go into JetBlue's recent debacles but it provides an excellent account of their rise to prominence. The lessons he learned are boiled down into a simple to read manner and it tells the interesting parts of the story. If you want the more detailed discussion of JetBlue check out the book Blue Streak but for a simple overview you can't go wrong here.

Molotov is one of the most interesting diplomats to emerge on the world scene in the 20th century. Aside from Kissinger no person ever probably played as big a role as he did in shaping foreign policy. From carving up Europe to laying the foundation of the Cold War Molotov was there. He served as President of Russia under Stalin and had tight control of many parts of the country. There are few people who could rightly be said to have known Stalin and Molotov was one of them. The book is well written and is the only one of its kind. I highly recommend it for those studying diplomatic or soviet history. Very well done indeed!

AJ P Taylor is one of the master historians of the European era and this book is one of the clear reasons why. Taylor analyzes the data available at the time and clearly and concisely traces the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War. Starting with the Treaty of Versailles and moving up through the new diplomatic outlook created from Locarno. The failure of the Locarno system becomes evident in the disastrous disarmament talks and the four power pact by Mussolini. Germany's rise to power as an aggressor coupled with the timidity and stupidity at times of Great Britain and France allowed anarchy to slip into war. Italy's reliance as a stable power was a huge miscalculation by the allies of Great Britain and France as Italy went to war in Ethiopia. The expanding and remilitarization of Germany caused more contention among the powers and the aloofness of the Soviet Union and United States forced Europe to deal with their own problems leading to war. Overall this is an excellent interpretation of the war and one that is truly a timeless classic. Highly recommend for those who wish to know more about why the war started.

This is the worst attempt by the people at Oxford. I am a big fan of all of their books and series but this one needs to be redone. The writing by all of the authors is terrible and no detail is given. While it is tough to cover the whole history of the country in one book this one fails miserably. Not only do you not even get a sense of how Italy developed you is left wondering what the point was. It does not leave you wanting more information in a good way but just disappoints. Stay away!

William McLoughlin offers one of the first looks at Cherokee society in his work on the evolution of the Cherokee tribe. This book takes the Cherokees through the early part of the American republic up through removal. Using journals and letters from Indian agents the book traces what happened to the tribe as the "civilization" efforts of the United States government were unleashed. The book tracks what changed in the nation from property rights, to gender roles, to the missionary work being conducted. Encroachment of settlers, states rights, and federal policy all played a role in shaping the outcome of one of the tribes that was seen as the "five civilized nations". Overall the book is well done, thorough and provide a unique insight into what happened to the Cherokees.

The Knights Templars by Frank Aneloo is an overview of how the knights Templar functioned and how they recruited their members and performed their deeds. Overall I found the book to lack something. The one big thing and this may come from Sanello being a journalist and not a historian is the lack of citations throughout the book and although there is a bibliography in the back I don't get a sense for what plugs in where to read more. I have no way to evaluate his opinions or conclusions being I do not specialize in this area at all but I found the book to jump around quite a bit and not focus in on a specific area. Perhaps those with a greater background in this area can offer more on how his book fits in to the ongoing debate but I feel I learned very little from this and I have almost no idea where to go for more information due to the way it is organized.

Frank McLynn always does an excellent job regardless of what subject her approaches. This is truly a day by day account of Napoleon's life from childhood through his battles. Although I prefer Robert Asprey's two book biography of Napoleon McLynn does an excellent job of explaining Napoleons rise and fall. Do not be deterred by the length it goes very quickly and is a great start for someone who wants to learn about Napoleon.

Patricia Galloway makes an effort to explore the early pre European Choctaw tribe in her book Choctaw Genesis. It is an excellent example of the limitless possibilities and limitless failures of ethnohistory. The Choctaw were a tribe that were spread between Alabama and Mississippi and came into contact of all three European powers on the north American continent. Galloway uses archeological, cartographical, linguistic and culture studies to try and gain an understanding of who and where the Choctaw were located in this time period. One of the flaws of this book for those who want to learn about the tribe itself is that it glazes over many studies without fully explaining the implications. For those who do not have an understanding of ethnohistory or have not read studies of this type it is way to convoluted. I had a very hard time following the importance of many things she was talking about as the significance of the archaeological or anthropological findings was not flushed out in detail. Overall this is probably a five star book if you are into ethnohistory or a one star book if you know nothing about Indians and are trying to learn something about the Choctaw tribe.

If you are planning a short trip to Scotland this is a must have book. It covers excellent restaurants and wonderful places to stop and shop. The essential sights are all listed by region and are explained in enough detail for one to decide if they want to visit. If you are going for a longer period of time I would recommend a bigger guide but I would still get this one to walk around with.

Scotland is a very diverse place and this travel guide does an excellent job of capturing all of the regions. It lays things out clearly and lets you plan a visit that encompasses all of Scotland or lets you really get down and focus on one region over another. It is very hard to find a good Scotland guide (that is not tied to a guide about Great Britain) and Eyewitness does the job. Highly recommend.

I spent a week in Boston and this book was great in helping me plan that trip. It offers lots of suggestions by region of the city which was a great way to plan. The restaurant recommendations were excellent and it is always fun to see what they recommend as the regional dishes. For those looking to soak up the history, culture and fun of Boston this is a great book to use in planning that trip.

Through a Howling Wilderness s is a straightforward account of the invasion of Canada conducted by the forces of the American Revolution. This was a multi-front assault on the city of Quebec and this book details Benedicts Arnold assault through the wilderness of Maine. Desjardin (who is primarily a historian of all things Maine) does an admirable job of putting the reader in the place of these troops as the trekked through snow, up mountains and wadded across near frozen rivers to their miraculous arrival at the gates of Quebec. The details of the assault and the ultimate failure are outlined well and the reversal that the Americans suffered made victory almost impossible. As Desjardin points out the only way to succeed would have been an immediate assault upon the arrival of Arnold's army and given their conditions and low supplies this was unlikely. As the British had time to reinforce, they were almost certain to overcome the Americans. None of this really matters as If eel the real contribution here to revolutionary historiography is that this assault did not need to succeed and won the revolution. By drawing British forces away from the colonies it allowed time for Washington and others to organize and train the army. Also the failure ensured that America would not have to defend Canada against a renewed British assault. If Canada had been taken British public opinion would have demanded swift action meaning a larger army to come and face the United States not only in the colonies but in Quebec and Montreal. Overall it is an excellent addition to revolution scholarship and well worth the time for a quick read.

The seven years war changed the face of the world. The year 1759 was decisive in the conflict of the war and established Britain's naval supremacy from America to India. Frank McLynn does an excellent job in all of his books explaining the context of the times. He clearly outlays how the British Empire developed. The naval battles are some of the most important in history and he explains the new tactics of the British navy. He also begins to show how this war will lead to American independence. This book is NOT the definitive book on the war and for that see Crucible of War by Fred Anderson.

James Madison might be the worst president in history when his life is laid out as Ketcham has done here. The administration was a complete failure from the loss of the capital to economic problems. Despite this Madison's contributions to the constitution and the bill of rights are impressive. Unfortunately this biography was not very well written and although the information was good I found myself slow to get through it. It does not hold in the tradition of many other biographies on people from these times that are real page turners. If you are truly interested in Madison this biography will do the job otherwise I would only rate it as mediocre for those who have an interest in the American Revolution.

Robert Massie always tells a good story and he does not fail to deliver here. This tells how World War 1 started and the arms race that launched the battle. Despite the title this book does not focus only on the naval buildup and goes into many other factors. Foreign policy in Africa and the Balkans are addressed as well as internal political struggles in Britain. The research is exhaustive and it is very well written. If you are looking for a good account of World War 1 this is the best place to start. Highly recommend.

If you are looking for a biography of Castro this is a decent one. There are better ones out there but taken alone this book will tell you the essential things about Castro. I would recommend Guerilla Prince or Fidel Castro by Quirk as a substitute for this book. It is well written but lacks the in depth analysis that the previous two mentioned provide. If you just want a quick introduction use this one but if you really want to know about Castro I would use one of the other two.

This book was an excellent summation of American foreign policy that was completely misguided. Very well written and well researched it details Kermit Roosevelt's efforts to over through Mossadegh and put the Shah of Iran on the throne. We can see the determination of the CIA and really see the CIA at its peak performance. While this coup was almost a failure it was pulled off and led to one of the greatest tragedies in American foreign policy turning a friendly nation against the United States. The author does not go into the British policy which was the true crux behind the overthrow but nonetheless this really was an excellent book and deserve six stars!

If you want to understand how the modern navy was born in America this is one of two books you will need. Understanding the mentality that drove our early navy to their few successes is a harrowing story that is told best here. This focuses on our lake fleets as well as our ocean fleets and does so in a very concise manner. The prose is very good and the information is well referenced. Anyone looking for information on the history of American navy will be well served with this book.

T. Harry Williams P. G T. Beauregard covers the life of one of the more interesting confederate generals during the Civil War. The Creole General or the Napoleon in Gray was a widely regarded celebrity that lives on in the annals of history that include Lee, Johnston, and Davis. Beauregard was never truly in command of independent field but served under and planned key battles for Shiloh, Manassas and the siege of Sumter. From his WestPoint training and experience in the Mexican American War he was ready like many of his contemporaries for command in the Civil War. He was a firm believer in the principles espoused by Jomini and Napoleon regarding concentration although he would often fail to utilize these due to his inability for logistics. Beauregard would be one of the primary commanders for Manassas and Sumter in the east before being transferred to the west under Albert Sidney Johnston to plan Shiloh and establish the base at Cornith, Mississippi.His disagreements with Jefferson Davis would relegate him to the sidelines preparing the defense of Charleston against siege which he would do admirably well. He was eventually transferred to Petersburg where he would command a defensive line ably against overwhelming odds until being sent back West again after disagreeing with Lee. Jefferson Davis would leave Beauregard without a direct field command in charge of two armies that were already finished. The great master of concentration was not prepared for the new way of war being fought by Sherman and was hopelessly outmatched as was his superior Joe Johnston to prepare for the fight against Sherman. Finally after the surrender of Lee, Beauregard and Johnston would arrange the surrender to Sherman of the last major confederate army in the field while Davis continued his flight.After the war Beauregard went back to Louisiana, where he was one of the few confederate generals to to make a living, as a railroad engineer and eventually ran the states Lottery system. Overall Williams does an excellent job of telling the story of this flamboyant general. He covers the high points and the low points fairly giving credit that has often been overlooked. Beauregard was rated as a second tier general since he never had a command but he participated in almost all of the major Confederate victories throughout the war and established some of the tightest fortifications that the Union had to overcome. His knowledge helped the confederacy extend its life longer than it would without him. Well worth the time for those who are looking to expand their Civil War knowledge.

Walter Borneman provides a accurate and succinct summary of the French and Indian War (Seven Years War) and its effect on the American colonies. The book tracks the campaigns and political tidings in North America during the war and shows the overwhelming force that England brought to bear against the French colonies in Canada. The book primarily covers the American parts of the war but does digress to cover the Caribbean, Manila and India as it relates to the global political strategy of William Pitt. Borneman takes the time to introduce the key characters and provides enough of the background material to understand its relevance. This book summarizes many of the key books on the French and Indian War. If you are looking for a detailed account this is not the place to start but if you are looking for a summary you can't go wrong. In addition to the summary it should be noted that this book also provides some of the better maps I have seen related to the war and really shows troop movements and layouts of forts well. The one reason I have to deduct a star is that the treatment of Indians in the book is fairly week. For all his time on diplomacy there is almost no attention to the Indian diplomacy that occurred nor much on the tactics that the famous "American rangers" adopted after working with the Indians. Overall though a great addition to the literature on the French and Indian war and a great summary book to start with.

This book does an excellent job of recounting the entire Yom Kippur War from both the military and political standpoints. The first 100 pages cover the lead up to the war and the diplomatic maneuverings on both sides. It assesses the United States and Soviet Unions role and the fear of what detente would mean for the participants. You even see the ironic nature of Jordan's King warning Israel of the impending attack. Israel left itself blind to the possibility of an attack and was caught completely off guard. When Egypt and Syria launched their invasion it was a devastating blow for Israel. Syria proved its military ineptness fairly quickly and although recapturing part of the Golan proved that it was not going to advance much further. Even the intervention of other Arab powers, most notably the Iraqi's, were unable to break the Israeli hold. Egypt would be another story entirely.Building the bridges literally in the face of the Israelis, the Egyptians crossed the Suez and attacked driving the Israelis back. Israel's own Patton, Arik Sharon, delivered some devastating attacks to the Egyptians and could have done more if not held back. The Israeli air force was hampered severely by SAM sights in Egypt. All of these aspects of war are very well covered and I will leave the surprising twists and turns out. One of the more notable parts is the Israeli reaction to the cease fire which they see as limiting their options and their attempts to flaunt it are many. The Israelis go so far as to get bogged down in invading Suez city. The end result of the war was a great victory for Egypt and a sober realization for Israel. This books analysis is top notch and does a wonderful job of showing what the wars significance is. If you want to understand the modern Middle East this is an essential book to read.

Dennis Judd's book on the history of the British Empire is not a day by day approach to empire but a focus on the most important events that shaped that empire. Things such as the India uprising in 1857 or the work of Cecil Rhodes are the main focus. The stories that are chosen do an excellent job of showing how the empire developed and the path it took to formation. This really is the best single volume work on the British Empire in terms of a pure history. The book covers all parts of the empire and has interesting vignettes such as the formation of the boy scouts. It also covers some of the major internal domestic squabbles within Great Britain as they relate to empire. I found that the discussions on how world war 1 and 2 affected the empire were very accurate and to the point. The reader can get a very good sense of how the British were drained of resources by the wars and see the effect this had on empire. As nationalistic movements took root in the various countries the British found it more difficult to control. Particularly with the end of Lend Lease by Truman the British were forced to grant independence to their colonies. The last few chapters focus on the remaining parts of the empire and how they fit into the commonwealth including the struggle with the Falkland Islands. If the reader wants a much more detailed account of the empire try to the Oxford history five volume British Empire. Judd's account is very readable and well done for those wanting a review of the salient points in the Empire's history.

Edmund Morris provides yet another great addition to the life of Theodore Roosevelt in this look at his time as president. This is a very thorough and well written account. It covers everything from the Great White Fleet, trust busting, the national park movement to the rise of American imperialism. The first term of the presidency is covered a little better than the first but regardless of the time frame you get an excellent view as TR the person. The dedication that this man had to learning, reading, physical activity is truly amazing and Morris does a superb job of bringing that out. Overall this is a very fair biography that takes great pains to remain fair and balanced. It looks at the immigration policies even handily and takes an honest look at American policy at the hands of the youngest president at that time. The first president to be born after the civil war put a different trend on national politics and reigned in the progressive era. All in all it is a Bully of a read!

If you are curious about how the British felt about Napoleon than look no further. This book is an excellent account of how the British perceived not only Napoleon but the French Revolution. From Edmond Burke's opinions to parliament this book analyzes the whole package. The prose is a little difficult to get through leading to my three star rating but overall this book provides some interesting information that is unmatched in any other text. If you want to look at relations between the countries this is a good place to start. On that note however the book is really not for beginners but is a good addition to a reading list on how Napoleon's obsession with Britain led to his downfall.

RJ Bosworth makes an interesting attempt at writing a positive biography of Mussolini. This book does a decent job of summarizing parts of the Duce's life but does jump around quite a bit. Many of the things that make this book useful are in relation to how it reacts to other biographies and accounts of Mussolini. Bosworth glazes over many of the foreign policy decisions which are where so many other biographies are highly critical of Mussolini. It is noteworthy to try and write a biography that puts Mussolini in a different light and when combined with Dennis Mack Smith's biography of Mussolini (which is pretty negative) the reader can get a great sense of Mussolini himself. Bosworth is one of the premiere Italian historians and his work is always insightful and well done. The only compliant I have with this book is the jumping around and skipping over areas. The Brenner Pass meeting is not covered in this book and that is one of the pivotal moments in Mussolini's life and Italian history. I still would recommend this book through as long as it is being read with other sources to get a more complete picture.

David Halberstam is truly a master story teller. His book on the fifties tries to show that a real cultural revolution was happening within the 1950's and this is not a return to normalcy like the 1920's. The book tracks the end of World War 2 with Truman's efforts and the election against Dewey before moving into the 1950's. The development of the Super bomb during that time period is especially relevant to the 1950's. Despite the start of the 50's having the Korean War Halberstam points out that people moved on to other things than the war and red baiting. The rise of the consumer culture characterized by Leavitt Town and the Chevrolet's of GM were the most telling symbols. The consumer culture is carried on in further detail by exploring the rise of five and dimes along with fast food and motels. These trends showed that the new generation had more money than their parents and were willing to spend it. The modern conveniences made those who saw these trends instant success stories.While progress appeared to be looming all over the country there were elements that began to change in reaction to what was occurring. The rise of modern politicians like Richard Nixon who had no ideology but merely a desire to gain elected office coupled with the rise of the beat generation. These new factors combined with the continued fear of "Reds" after McCarthy's fall led to interesting developments. The most notable of these was the removal of Oppenhiemer's security clearance. The reactions were especially occurring with regards to race in the south. The landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education created a situation in which those who were law abiding citizens now felt determined to resist the law. Initially little happened but sentiment quickly rose against the white south. With cases like Emmitt Till and others the north saw the full brutality of a racist south. The change came and would shake the foundations of southern society to its core. Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King would emerge during this same time period starting the civil rights movement that would come to power in the 60's. Meanwhile across the country Elvis and other black musicians singing R&B; or rock n' roll music began to cause a sensation. These performers electrified the stage and drew crowds of screaming teenagers wherever they went. These included new stars such as James Dean, Marylyn Monroe and Marlin Brando.The final transformation in the 1950's was the period where the country began to lose faith in itself. The scandals that rocked the country from the quiz shows to Little Rock forced the country to see itself in an ugly light. The good feelings that were present in World War 2 began to be lost as Gary Powers were caught and the United States was forced to admit it was violating Soviet airspace at the president's orders. The launching of Sputnik and the failure of our first launches cast doubt over our technological superiority. The final insult would occur with the Bay of Pigs that Eisenhower had ordered planned only to have fail under Kennedy. The American public was ready for the reassurance that Kennedy seemed to offer. These events all helped shape the way the country would form within the 1960's. The paradigm that was established in the 1950's made a clear break from World War 2 and set the United States on the course to modernity.Halberstam's greatest success in this book comes from his ability to use a multidisciplinary approach to looking at how the 1950's shaped America. By using literature, science, technology, film, history and other disciplines he blends together a complex set of events into a wonderful narrative. This book can be read on many levels. On its simplest level it is merely a recount of what happened during the 1950's and how the United States evolved. If you look closer you can see the start of a social revolution that shook the core of American life. Halberstam is a master at writing and his narratives are well worth the time to read. This particular account is one of the best you can read. If you are interested in getting a wider perspective see Patterson's "Grand Expectations" in the Oxford History of the United States.

This book was an interesting attempt at describing the battle but got distracted in many areas. It would go into politics that influenced movements in France but then switched to military descriptions. One of the pluses is the personalized and journal accounts that are given throughout the book. I just for some reason could not get into the book and got bored at several points. When I did finish the book I just could not really figure out what his thesis was and what he wanted to accomplish other than retelling the story. If you are looking for a retelling story than this is a good book for you.

This is another excellent book by Winchester who does wonderful geological history. Krakatoa was a cataclysmic natural disaster that affected the world. Its seismic effects were felt across the world. There was plenty of warning across the world and most of it went ignored but when it exploded the response was immediate. The island was completely swallowed and the implications are well outlined. As with all Wincheser books the general effects of a volcano are outlined. Occasionally it does wonder off topic but it mostly stays on track and does an excellent job relating to the main topic.

The missions in Latin America are very different from those in the United States. Saeger takes a unique view by looking at a group that was able to resist the missions. The book is very well written and gives you a sense of what the mission system looked like. The book is very well written and is straight to the point. It is divided up so that if you are only interested in a small aspect of the system you could read a few chapters or the whole book to get a sense overall. For those who want to understand the early Indians and Spanish interactions this is the perfect book.

Donald Trumps books are usually more entertainment than they are useful. This one offers quite a bit of information and gives the reasons behind the Donald's various schemes. It really shows his passion and gives some great advice for people to follow in their own lives. He offers some of his family history and how he got this start which was very interesting. If you are only going to read one book by Trump this is the essential one to read.

How did Intel become the most powerful company and why did they do so well after deregulation. This is the story that tells how the Pentium chip tried to change the world and sets the stage for how AMD fell behind (until recently). Andy Grove gives great management tips but this remains mostly the story of Intel. Andy Grove has several other books for management strategies. I highly recommend this for those who want to understand how the computer industry arrives at where it is today.

When I first thought about reading this book it was almost laughable. I thought who would want to read a book about the building of a bridge. In trusting McCullough I was not disappointed. This book sucks the reader into a world of disaster and eventual triumph. It is also an excellent addition to urban history of New York. For those interested in the history of technology they will find plenty here from the ideas of laying the pylons to the suspension techniques used. This harrowing tale of triumph over the problem is very inspiring and is something that all should read. For those who consider themselves true American historians this is a must have for their library.

Kemp is a British writer that makes an effort to understand the battle between Boeing and Airbus. He did plenty of interviews with top people in both organizations and was one of the first to publish a book on the subject. There have been many more since than and each one gets better. Two flaws with the Kemp book are his bias towards Airbus and his narrow look at business strategy. He comes close to showing that Airbus and Boeing were hedging against the others strengths by developing several models of planes. In the end though he jumps back to his analysis of the dreamliner vs. the A380 and does not look at the wider market of the companies. As the book progresses forward the analysis does get better and the real competition becomes apparent. The salesmanship of the Airbus team against the engineering of the Boeing. The size of Airbus vs. the speed of Boeing are all played out through this struggle. The book jumps around quite a bit but it does provide a good start for the time it was published. I do recommend this book but just be warned the beginning is slow and the analysis could be a little more focused.

This book is a truly fascinating study for those interested in the urban history of New York, political power, or urban development. It clearly looks at the rise of Robert Moses who would go on to hold 12 different state, local and private positions including president of the World Fair. Through these interlocking positions Moses would command the resources to build almost all of the major roads, bridges and parkways in the five boroughs today. The story of how these roads came into being is fascinating and articulately and artfully told in this wonderful narrative. In a story so mind boggling it is almost hard to believe you see how "the civil servant that got things done" accomplishes bureaucratic wrangling to harness federal, state, local and private dollars into mammoth building projects. From Jones Beach to the Triborough Authority the master of legislative and monetary manipulation brought together the necessary engineering and political talent to achieve these projects in record time. Despite having enemies as powerful as the President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt or mayor of New York City La Guardia try to oust him he always held on. His ability to blend power from a variety of different sources and form "authorities" that were semi private with shareholders protected by legal rights he could keep his positions. The book covers so many different aspects that a review could go on for 30 pages but the bottom line is that this is a classic in political and urban history that should not be missed.Cl

This book covers a wide range of issues related to the development of gas stations in America. Its primary focus is to show how the idea of the gas stationed developed and how it changed the cultural and physical landscape of America. There are wonderful pictures in here that show a wide range of gas stations and layouts around the city. It is also an excellent corporate history of oil companies and their role in serving as gas stations. It takes a look at the break up of Standard Oil and its subsidiaries to the mom and pop operations that ran across the country. The idea of product placement is loosely tied in throughout the book and I think the authors are forced to stretch to far to place it here. The book takes on a very academic quality with that discussion and for the general reader it will be a waste of time. As a historian I did not find it useful and I enjoyed the discussion of how these stations developed. Overall this is one of the best sources out there on how the gas station evolved and an excellent look at urban history.

The authors goal of trying to show how the 20th century was going to be radically different from the 19th is a tough one to pull of but Rauchway makes a valiant effort. This book deserves five starts because it takes a topic that no one else has attempted and presents the information well. There are a few minor errors that I discovered but on the whole it presents a useful history that when taken in context is an excellent segway into the era of American imperialism. Overall this is a good book that is a great read for those who have knowledge about the Gilded Age.

Gregory Dowd provides an interesting look at how native Americans banded together against Europeans and the United States in his book A Spirited Resistance. This book tracks the major gatherings and prophets that met to try and unify Indians across familial and tribal lines. While many were not successful there was interregional collaboration which provided a new dimension to Indian affairs. One of the unique aspects of this book is that it shows the European classification of each tribe as a nation may not have been necessary as the Indians began to redefine their own place in society. While the book places the majority of the reasons for pan-indianism as religious it is very clear that they were primarily realpolitik calculations. They would be almost entirely realpolitik calculations expect for the almost unexplainable fact that they continued to fight with bows and arrows despite the access to guns. Dowd tracks the major events well in this book and if you are starting out looking at Indians and the government than this is a very good place to start. While it is not ideal for looking at individual tribes (see my other reviews for books on tribes portrayed in the book) it does provide an excellent view of how the Indians found common ground with one another.The book is easy to read and covers a wide range of years in a short amount of pages. If you are looking at the correlation of disparate tribes coming together than this will help tremendously in gaining an understanding of how culturally different peoples come together. It tracks tribes from the great lakes to the gulf coast and is truly an amazing feat given what is necessary to understand all of these groups. Overall I think more attention could have been paid to other explanations than religion which is why the book is a four out of five. Still very interesting and well worth a read.

This is an excellent guide for those who want to sample what the United States has to offer. It is an excellent place to start especially if you are only going to be traveling through a lot of places. If you are going to someplace for a week this book will not be helpful and you should get the regional guides. Overall planning a cross country trip it gives lots of advice on cities as well as small out of the way places that would be fun to see. Great addition to a travel book collection.

This book is a combination of several primary sources related directly to Benito Mussolini. The first "My Rise" was Mussolini's account of how he came to power in Italy. It has its uses but the reader should be ware that it does omit several parts of his rise to power and it is worth keeping a good Mussolini biography close at hand to compare the account with. "My Fall" is a compilation of about a dozen articles penned by Mussolini about the time that occurred from the Grand Council meeting to the establishment of the Salo Republic. Overall these provide an interesting look into Mussolini's mind and a chance to understand what he considered important in his life. The accounts are well written and Mussolini does an excellent job of recounting the parts he feels are relevant. It is with an eye towards revisionist history but despite that the documents can still be useful. All of the preface and introductions are done by top notch historians and do an excellent job of putting things in perspective.

In Edward Leslie's first book he delivers an excellent account of the life of William Quantrill who was regarded as one of the most vicious commanders in the Civil War. Whether people sided with him as a legitimate soldier or an outlaw chieftain leading a band of thieves and murders the one common thing they agreed upon was his ruthless determination to do harm to the union. So little has been written about the border wars that this provides a fascinating look at the tit for tat strategy and counter raids that often are written off as simple thievery by other authors. The Union was not always in the right as seen by the devastating Order 11 which swelled Quantrill's ranks with new recruits eager to shoot union soldiers. Leslie also takes some time at the end to cover the fate of the various people who rode with an against Quantrill detailing what happens including the notorious Younger and James brothers who would become infamous in the years following the Civil War using the tactics practiced by Quantrill. Quantrill himself would be killed after being hounded by Union soldiers and being the most wanted man in the West.The one hard part about this subject is the lack of available written sources. While most Civil War literature is filled with primary accounts and journals that survived this is not the case with the border war. We have a few military dispatches and newspaper accounts but most of the direct participating did not keep journals. Leslie puts together what he can and tells the reader when he is going off of rumor or speculation which happens at several points due to lack of hard primary sources. Due to his responsible use I don't see any problem with the book as some other reviewers have. It is well worth the time to gain a greater understanding of the border war and one of the most interesting figures of the Civil War.

This book is one of the greatest contributors to the re-evaluation of international relations theory. Before I get into the review a few technical warnings should be issued. This is not a book for those who have no background in international relations (IR) theory. The author uses a lot of jargon and is trying to refute many of the top theorists in IR today so it is not a good starting point for world order. On that note though this is a truly important development in the way IR theorists view the world. Many IR theorists today are reexamining the role of the state in international politics and whether or not the state is the correct way to analyze actors on a world stage.The Myth of 1648 goes a step beyond this and shows that the state is not even a valid organism for assessing actors on a world stage. He shows that people had a way of defining sovereignty and identity as early as the middle ages by the way they were aligned to a king or lord and that these are ways to organize as well. It relies along the newer accepted technique of defining organization along cultural lines and in this case taking it a step further to class lines. It goes to class lines without having the usual Marxist tone of revolution which provides a more useful way to organize since the revolutions frequently do not occur. The book relies on the organization of people through geopolitics and regional organizations that do not necessarily have to be states. It shows that whether absolutist or even capitalist Britain people organize around familial ties and not limited by traditional state geography.This book is brilliantly done and a well thought out argument for those who are used to typical IR theory. Like most IR theory it is filled with jargon so if you are starting out this is not the best book to begin with. Try John Mearshiemer or Kenneth Waltz to begin with and then expand to something like this.

James McPherson is one of the top civil war historians and this is his greatest book. It covers not only the whole of the war with objective analysis that takes into consideration sources on both sides but also the start of the war. From the annexation of Texas and the war with Mexico where our commanders got their experience McPherson demonstrates his expert knowledge. The book recounts not only the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac, but also looks at the western front. The battles in the west were easily as important as the east and this provides a great summary. It also takes into account the slave question, economic concerns and foreign diplomacy. The two chapters on the navy and river battles are expertly done and capture the advancements made in naval technology during the times. The end of the war is well categorized and the book does not get bogged down in countless battle details. The final days of the confederacy are seen for what they are. It was a nation that was defeated and unable to keep its army in the field. The book is very well written and easy to read making it a sheer joy to understand the civil war. This is an essential book for any student of history or anyone who wants to learn about the Civil War.

The life and legacy of Milton Hershey is one of the more intriguing stories in American business and history. The debates of ruthless business man or utopian planer are debated frequently and this book does an excellent job of putting it in perspective. It is light and well written allowing easy access to the story of Milton Hershey and his legacies including his town, his company and his favorite, the Milton Hershey School for Boys. I have to agree with the other reviewers in echoing that this is an unbiased and critical account of Hershey's life. The author finds fault when there is fault and puts his success into perspective showing how Hershey set the tone for the progressive businessman. For those who are looking for a purely corporate history this book is not for you (try Emperors of Chocolate). This book is about the Hershey family and the candy company they built along with the town. As a frequent visitor to Hershey I found the history of the town to be fascinating. Overall well worth the time to read.

The Great Triumvirate paints a rich picture of the political life in the early 1800's. The lives of Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster would shape the course of politics during the first half of the 1800's. These men would pick up where the founding fathers left off and define what it would mean to be American. They represented their sections of the countries but each would bow to the political realties of the time. In the end they were so good at representing their sections that their efforts to achieve the presidency would be met with failure. Henry Clay "the great compromiser" was a tyrant of the Senate and his political domination was impressive in preventing an outbreak of the civil war. While from the South Calhoun was an astute political observer who worked to preserve the institution of slavery. Daniel Webster as the fiery orator from the North was the consummate constitutionalist who the abolitionists hoped to have on their side. These three would "rule" the United States through their congressional domination like the triumvirates of Rome. The interaction between the three was not as great as I expected and more often than not they were working at cross purposes. The political pandering that grows out of this time period (especially with regard to Calhoun) sets the stage for the political discourse that we see emerging in the United States today. The election of 1848 painted here bears remarkable parallels to the 2008 presidential election that is shaping up. For those who want an understanding of our political history this is an essential book to read. These three men defined the next evolution in American government and this is the best book to show how they worked against and with each other to achieve the union.

If you are planning a trip to Dublin this is a must have book. It outlines the city and gives excellent recommendations on where to stay and eat. The way the city is divided up in the book is the perfect way to plan your trip and can be divided into really three days. It has some outlying things but if you are going around Ireland I would use the Eyewitness book on Ireland and pass on this one.

If you are planning a short trip to Dublin this is a must have book. It covers excellent restaurants and wonderful places to stop and shop. The essential sights are all listed by region and are explained in enough detail for one to decide if they want to visit. If you are going for a longer period of time I would recommend a bigger guide but I would still get this one to walk around with.

DCM Platt's book gives an excellent resource to the development of British Trade in Latin America following the independence of so many countries there. IT shows that the myth of British dominance is most untrue and that Latin America was a small subset of total world trade. The importance of the empire is illustrated here as Latin America makes up a small percentage of the trade. In reality Latin America was somewhat self sufficient and was able to take care of itself. British trade did increase over the years and became important. The competition with Germany and the United States did cut into the profits but Britain made most of their money off Brazil and Argentina and not the region as a whole. The trade with those two countries would remain strong throughout the whole of the 19th Century. Overall this is an easy to read book that allows the reader to skim through the economic data if they choose and if not they have access to excellent charts at their fingertips. For those wanting to understand British trade during the age of empire this is a must read.

This early McCullough book provides a look at one of the most catastrophic disasters to strike America. The Johnstown Flood destroyed more than 2500 lives and changed the landscape of western Pennsylvania. It moved the nation towards relief efforts and spurred a country to act on behalf of their common man. As always the author captures the people and the time in stunning clarity and really puts the reader there giving them a first person perspective on what happened to the people. After living in Pennsylvania for more than six years I found that few people really knew about the flood but this book does an excellent job of filling the blanks. If you want to see a trying story told in wonderful detail this is the place to start.

The story of how Mars and Hershey have fought for control over the candy market is one of the most fascinating in business. Mars is one of the most secretive companies on the planet and the recopies for M&M's and Mars bars are closely guarded. Hershey in sharp contrast was crated be a paradise for the workers of the company with stores, theaters, theme parks and all of their needs taken care. These companies ruthlessly battled it out and while others are covered including Nestle the real winner are Hershey and mars controlling almost 75 percent of candy in the United States. If you are looking for a good business story this is the best. It is well written and a lot of fun to read.

The Origins of the Pact of Steel is a great compilation of primary sources and translations that can really help researchers if you are in that field. If you are just generally trying to read about the alliance system that permeated World War II however this is probably not the book to you. It is large chunks of reprinted text with very little analysis. It is a great primary source reader overall. If you are trying to look at the various groups that formed the pact of steel this will provide you internal memos, documents and speeches by all of them. It is easy to read but can be tedious with large chunks of reprinted primary sources. Essentially if you are a research this is a must grab for looking at World War II diplomacy.

Diaz was one of the soldiers who accompanied Cortez to invade the Aztec Empire. His account is one of the best we have of the whole affair. It is not written with much bias and was written to discount historical myths after the invasion had taken place. It is very analytical at times and his analysis of what happened is given added authority since he was present at the events. If you want to understand what happened this is a great book to read.

For those who enjoyed made in America this is the book that will take your through Wal-Marts current years. There is a brief synopsis of their past but it mostly focuses on the 1990's and the tremendous backlash against Wal-Mart that resulted from that decade. The book is well written but could have had more information. If you are looking for more on Wal-Mart though this is the best place to get it and Robert Slater has put out several books on the company and he does first rate analysis. If you are looking for a book that blames Wal-Mart for the sins of the country you won't find it here. This is simply business analysis.

Jon Meacham presents an interesting portrait of two leaders in World War II and the way they united the allies. This book is not meant to serve as a book on World War II and diplomacy but on the relationship between FDR and Churchill. In doing so the author presents a unique perspective that has not been looked at in many of the countless World War II books. The personal relationship of these two men (much like the personal relationship of their enemies Mussolini and Hitler) drove and shaped the course of the war. Each complimented each others strengths and in the end allowed for a unique position to be taken. There had been few examples of this kind of diplomacy before World War II and Meacham shows a diplomacy that would be very important thereafter. This book is filled with excerpts from personal letters and is very well cited. For those who want a different look that your standard World War II books this is an excellent place to start. It is a very light book to read and a lot of fun.

The idea of the Caudillo is interesting and has been uniquely Latin American. This book tries to look at how Caudillo's operated and the wars they started from the independence movement to the start of modernization. It includes Rosas in Argentina and his efforts to consolidate the country as well as the War of the Triple Alliance. The book is set up very well as a reference guide and I use it whenever I am about to talk about a war in Latin America. This is an essential addition to any Latin American history library.

Scheina does an excellent job with the second installment of Latin America;s Wars. This time he focuses on the nations of Latin America and their professional armies. He includes the conflicts in both world wars as well as the various interwar rebellions fought. The book also includes the fight over the Falkland Islands. The Mexican revolution takes up a few chapters of the book but it is a very good analysis. Like his other book this one is really much more of a reference guide to Latin American wars and is a great companion to textbooks. It is a must have for any library on Latin American History.

Hopkrik takes a break for his usual Great Game stories to explore the Central Asian deserts that have long been forgotten. This book includes a brief introduction to the Silk Road and China,s relations with Barbarians. The bulk of the book is focused on the explorers who penetrated its mysteries and their tales. From Sven Hedin to Aurel Stien explorers were removing the treasures of this hidden landscape. These treasures unlockedimportant history until the Chinese decided to prevent their history from being pilfered away to foreign museums. For those who are curious about archeology or just love Hopkrik this is a great book. It is not up to par with his usual stories that everyone would enjoy so read selectively.

Greenspan: the Man Behind the Money by Justin Martin is an interesting look at Greenspan's life and the influences that drove him in his various positions. There are two drawbacks to the book. One is the lack of direct access to Greenspan. This is a biography written from second hand sources as far as interviews are concerned and interpretations of his testimony in addition to news articles. With that in mind it is still an interesting story and looks at many of the experiences from his time on Wall Street as a consultant to his various government posts that led up to his time at the fed. The second problem with this book is that it is older and was written pre stock market bubble (a short afterword is added but really addresses nothing) and obviously if pre-internet bubble it is also pre 9/11. Overall this is a good introduction of Greenspan's life but it should be taken with either Woodward's book or better yet contrasted against Greenspan's auto-biography.

The Crimean war shattered the peace of Europe that had been established since Napoleon and set the course for World War 1. The disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the advances of Russia are prominent in the war. The famed charge of the light brigade occurred during this war and the trench warfare of World War 1 can be seen. This was really fought over a very small amount of land and in hellish terrain. The book is very well written and does an excellent job of discussing how the war progressed. Overall an excellent book and one that I would recommend.

Overall this is a very thorough account of the Fall of Rome from all angles in how the barbarians affected military, economic and political relations within the Eastern and Western Roman Empire. Starting from a quick overview of how Roman power was concentrated and what it meant to be Roman the book quickly moves through a VERY detailed analysis of how the Roman Empire fell from Hunnic assaults to Germanic Revolts, to expanding beyond the limits that their power projection was able to cover. Heather delivers tons of detail with very thorough analysis regarding what the barbarian invasions did to Roman order and political structure as well as the strain on their economy of defending such a large border region. The biggest complaint for this book is that Heather assumes a pretty solid knowledge of Rome and does not always stop to explain for those who don't know as much on the subject. He does provide a good timeline and important player list but it gets tedious to constantly referrer back to it when a few more sentences would have covered the need for the explanation in the back. Overall though if you are looking for a book on the fall of Rome this is a great one to have in your collection.

What role did disease play in shaping the conquest of the New World. This book accounts for more than just the Aztec invasion but covers the Caribbean and South America as well. It is very well written and takes an interesting look at the epidemiology of the region. For those interested in either the imperial conquests of Spain or the development of epidemiology this is a great book. Cook writes very well and in most places his epidemiological accounts are well supported.

The Seven Years war was a devastating time for France and Jonathan Dull tries to explain what happened in this great addition to the literature. It is a quick read and at times gets very heavy into the statistics. The basic problem of the French is they are outgunned and towards the end of the war outmaneuvered almost everywhere. Dull does a wonderful job with clear prose of illustrating this and it is a great book for someone who wants to learn more about the Seven Years war. This is not a good intro book to the war but once you have a basic sense it is a great way to expand your knowledge. It is highly recommend for colonial students that want to learn why the colonies shaped the way they did and how the dominance of France was replaced by an empire where the sun never sets.

This is an excellent compilation from the man in charge of Italy following the downfall of Mussolini. It very carefully tracks what happened to Italy and the efforts to reconstruct a government up until the recapture of Rome. Badoglio was one of the key members of the military who participated not only in Ethiopia but also the governing of Africa. He was trusted by the King, the people, and the fascist. His thoughts are clearly recorded here and provide a unique primary source into understanding what happened to Italy following Mussolini's abdication. Excellent to work with if you are studying this time period.

This book provides an intimate an unique look into how the Creek Indians lived throughout the time of the new republic. It begins with the establishment of the US Indian agent and how life changed through acculturation, accommodation, and resistance. Trade patterns, gender roles, and political structure all changed with the redeployment of American citizens. Although much of the land was taken up by illegal means the creeks were still forced to contend with the way that new societies emerged. The primary source for the book is the letters and diary of Benjamin Hawkins who was the United States government representative and former north Carolina senator to take up the process of reforming the Creeks. Hawkins dictated a great deal of life and his notes are very through. Combined with enthonhistorical techniques the reader gets a very interesting view of Creek Society from the inside. Very easy to read and a great start to understanding how the Indians lived in the colonial world.

Watkins does a decent job of explaining how the idea of "the pill" came into being. It covers the initial social controversies and medical developments of birth control. The coalitions between Planned Parenthood and the original race for private grant money show an interesting alliance. Watkins really does an excellent job of looking at all the groups who had a stake in this project including the Catholic Church, FDA and medical professionals. It is not simply a feminist history but a multifaceted study of how the Pill became one of the most consumed drugs in the country.One of the disappointing factors and the main reason I would only rate it at 4 stars is that if is very narrowly focused in the brand of pill that it follows. It really does not go into the other ones that were coming out as competition in the 1970's even as an afterthought and I feel that is important to address. The book is very well written and is a great addition to the history of science and pharmaceuticals. I really wish we had more like it.

While it may look daunting this book analyzes the social, political and technological implications of building a railroad that spans the country. It looks at the corruption and mismanagement of workers as well as looking at how the country benefited from being made whole. This is a great place to start for understanding the United States economic rise to power after the Civil War.

This book is a valiant effort to understand the only true war in the history of Latin America but in the end it falls short. I feel that some of the classifications for starting the conflict are wrong and his analysis is shaky. He takes several liberties and makes excuses for the dictator in Paraguay. If you are looking for information on the war try reading To the bitter end by Chris Leuchars. It is much better written and focused. I don't think we will be seeing volume two anytime soon so if you want the whole war see the other book. Overall just stay away.

Following Theodore Whites publication of "The Making of the President" about the 1960 presidential election there has been a rush to produce THE BOOK about every presidential election in modern history. In this case this book stops short of being the definitive account but offers a valid and good synopsis. It's main problem is a lack of detail in some areas that would have enhanced the overall delivery and explanation of domestic issues and the mood of the country. Without a doubt it you want an overview of the main problems Cater had in running and the advantages Reagan enjoyed you will get them out of here. The one shining star and why I rate the book a four instead of a three comes from the coverage of Cater vs. Kennedy and how Ted Kennedy's entry into the race doomed him from the start. Kennedy was disorganized and tried the backdoor way of running a campaign by pretending that he was not running. For those interested in electoral politics this is a great book and for those interested in US political history it is an average book.

James Nelson does an excellent job of describing the importance of the battle between the first two ironclads in world history. The USS Monitor (Erickson's Battery) against the CSS Virginia (formerly USS Merricmack) was tactically a draw but each side claimed victory and the world naval community was forever changed. The CSS Virginia's easy destruction of the Cumberland and Constitution showed the end of the wooden era and although that as largely the end of its destructive rampage, the psychological damage would be immense for the Union. Shortly after the Virginia destroyed those two ships the Monitor arrived on scene and for four hours the two ships battered each other causing no damage to either. The book goes on to describe how the Virginia would be blown up as McClellan's army invaded the peninsula and took Norfolk. The Monitor would not outlast its foe much longer when it was damaged in a storm about a year later and sunk with several hands lost. Many other ironclads would be built throughout the civil war this battle represented the triumph of the new navy and the future of shipbuilding in the United States.Each side realized the immense value of an ironclad and raced to build as many as they could. The North's immense industrial advantage gave them the lead in building. One of the things that Nelson does very well is laying out the naval administrative sides for both North and South. He has done a superb job to show how each navy debated which ironclads to use and how they went about building them. It is a great look at an often referenced Civil War story that is explained in a great detail. The only complaint worth maybe a half star off is he jumps from north and south frequently with very little transition and you have to read very closely to notice when he makes his switch. Otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable read and for Civil War fans a must.

You can see the importance of the pharmacist in American life by watching the growth of this spectacular company. Although I would have like a little more time spent on where the future lies in this business and whether the corner drug store will continue to thrive this is a great book. For those looking for an introduction into retail pharmacy this is a great start.

There is so much to see and even if you are just doing a cruise of the country this is still worth buying. At the time I was only going to Oslo but on my second trip back I toured the rest of the country and this book was useful on both occasions. While it would be nice if DK made an Oslo book this one will be great in the meantime.

This book brings together an excellent collection of reformers writings from the period of religious reformation where politics and religion were synonymous with each other. The topics are wide ranging from Muntzer to those who organized the peasants' revolt. Baylor provides a good introduction for each and in parts where the text are difficult adequate foot noting is provided. If you are looking for a good start to the primary sources of the Reformation you cannot do any better. This is a great classic also for those who are studying the early methods of political thought before it was easily defined liberalism under Hobbes and Locke.

Bismarck is one of the most dominant statesman in Europe and Eyck brings out his character in this short but good biography. While my one compliant is that a lot more time then I felt necessary was spent on his childhood years the rest of the book is great. He analyzes the political struggles and economic rises of Germany and gives compelling and well cited arguments for all of it. It is a little hard to read if you don't have knowledge of German history but it can be read without and still enjoyed. The prose is very good but a little dry in the beginning like most biographies.

William Manchester provides one of the best overviews of the life of General MacArthur that has been written about the man. MacArthur was an enigma to many who knew him (which was a precious few) and brought out the best and worst qualities of a human. He was a military genius who cared deeply for his troops wining tremendous tactical victories and caring for his wife and son deeply. He was paranoid, vain and manipulated everyone for his own personal gain. This book which starts from his time growing up in Manila and Michigan and ending with his funeral is very thorough. It spends a great deal of time on World War II where he developed tactically but also covers his rise in the military via his mother and his hubris in the Korean War. It is an excellent and well written book that is clear and easy to follow. For those who want to learn about Macarthur you can do no better.

This book takes the reader through the San Francisco conference that established the United Nations (UN) and shows how the organization came into being. This is not meant to serve as a history of the UN and it does not take a position on whether it is good or bad. It merely discusses the differences that the nations had in the big power arena and focuses on a couple of the bigger disputes. The decision to add Belarus and Ukraine to the delegation but not Poland is explored as well as what to do with Argentina. The Truman administration inherited a tough war and an even tougher peace. The United Nations framework was built on the Yalta agreements which Truman was not even at. Sttennius and his state department team would be the real victors with the establishment of the UN despite Truman's desire to install a new secretary of state. The book has several areas where the language is unclear and it is hard to follow the authors point but largely it is well done and good analysis. The author knows his subject well and it is an excellent look at how diplomatic history should be done. If you really want to learn about how the UN was started this is the book to use.

This is a military account of the Soviet march to Germany after Hitler's disastrous attack. While the military descriptions are good the prose is generally disappointing the book is disjointed. It focuses on the military aspects only and pays little to no attention to other social or political factors that were occurring at the time. Little mention is given to the allies and their efforts which were impacting the march but if you are looking for battle descriptions this is the book for you.

Michael Kauffman provides a very detailed look at the Lincoln assassination and all of the members involved from the planning to their manhunt and the results that followed. Don't let the title fool you. This is far more than just a biography of John Wilkes Booth. Kaufmann pulls along voluminous sources of primary information to explore the build up of the conspiracy from the debates about whether or not to kidnap the president and finally the plan to kill him at Ford's Theater. The author pieces together much of the planning information and provides a clear flow of events from the Stuart boarding house to the plans laid at Ford's Theater on the famed night. From Booth's time as an actor on the stage to his struggling loyalties to the South the stage was set for the assassination. The book also tracks the other facets of the attacks on Seward and the planned attacks on other government members that ended in failure.The second half of the book focuses on the escape of the assailants and the efforts of Stanton's war department to bring them to justice. As the fugitives fled in all directions (and some not even leaving DC) the war department sent orders to all troops to block roads and deploy cavalry. Amazingly John Wilkes Booth and his compatriots still escape the city. As they flee to what they hope will be a sympathetic South they find that southerners have turned against them and are horrified by his actions. As detectives are brought in from all over the country and one of the largest investigations in American history is launched hundreds of people are swept up for questioning and many will be held as material witnesses to the crime. Booth is shot and killed at a farm near Orange VA but his co-conspirator is caught with him and brought to trial along with many others including Mary Stuart who will become the first female to be executed by the Federal Government. Kauffman also spends time covering the military tribunals that tried the conspirators and condemned four of them to death and several others to imprisonment on a remote island in the Gulf of Mexico.Overall this is an extremely well written book that is filled with detail on the assassination efforts of the conspirators and their manhunt. It is gripping and holds the readers interest while providing a host of details. Easily the best book to start with on the assassination and well worth an addition to any Civil War Library.

The take over of Chrysler by Diamler-Benz was heralded as the "merger of equals". This merger was a joke that was really a buyout of an American icon. The story of the merger is one of intrigue on two continents and is told very well here. It is an interesting book and very well written. I highly recommend it for those who want to see what happened at Chrysler after Iacocca retired.

This is truly one of the most disturbing stories in World War 2. Ciano would become the epitome of everything hated in Italy. He would claim responsibility for the invasion of Albania and Greece and blamed for some of the worst defeats in Italy's history. Much of this is undeserved as Mussolini was calling many of the shots and the fall out between the two became apparent. Had Ciano been stronger and not captured under the personality cult of Mussolini the break would have been bigger and he would have opposed the war shattering the Duce ideas of a strong Italian army. The diaries that Ciano wrote would be key aspects of Nuremberg and both the allies and axis sought to acquire them. The story of the acquisition is heart wrenching and Edda Ciano's bravery is truly remarkable. What she went through from the execution of her husband to the estrangement of her father Mussolini was simply amazing. This is a must read for those who want to understand how World War 2 unfolded and the war that Italy played. It is a well written biography and truly a great addition to the historiography.

King Leopold's Ghost provides a fascinating story of the Congo under the colonial rule of Leopold during the scramble for Africa. It is a book that covers the terror and greed inflicted by the monarch versus the efforts of several different people who worked through religion, popular press, politics and business to bring reforms to the Congo. While these reforms were motivated by different reasons they were about the stopping of essentially slave labor that was harvesting rubber and building public works projects throughout the Congo. While simplified into good and evil the author makes several valid arguments and tells a story that is often overlooked in most history books. The book is very well written, tells great anecdotal stories along with supplemental historical documents to weave together a rich text that highlights the fall of Leopold's Congo and the slave workers that practiced there. Overall you cannot get a more interesting read on this part of history and easily one of the best books written on colonial Africa. Whether you are an expert in the area or just starting out you cannot go wrong with this one.

Making Dough is a "popular" business analysis of the Krispy Kreme company and looks at why it is successful. While the book is not bad it is lacking in details or hard business analysis that seems to be an overall trend in newer business books. This will not get into profit and loss ratios, in-depth marketing's schemes, or financial details that make business books worth reading to learn about a business. Nor it is a history of the company giving you insight into why it developed the way that it did. The reader gets a little taste of the history, a little taste of the franchise model, and 12 "key" aspects to business that could be gleamed from any intro to business class in college. If you are looking more into why Krispy Kreme has become a part of Americana culture this book may serve you better as they are some great sociological insights which bring this book up from two stars to three. Overall just kind of average.

This book does a masterful job of explaining two important ideas in the America revolution. First and foremost it deconstructs the myths surrounding Valley Forge and while showing how hard it was at times for the soldiers it also puts their struggle into perspective. The author does an excellent job of looking at how Lafayette and Baron von Stoyben figure into the revolution. The most impressive part however is the way in which the author looks at George Washington's political side. He analyzes how Washington fended off attacks from several political enemies including Horatio Gates. The quartermaster problem that the army faced is shown in acute detail. This book does take a look at the battle of Monmouth in addition to these two topics but the battle is looked at as an afterthought and much more could have been said. Despite that flaw it is still a 4 start book and covers an area of the revolution not yet written about in much of the literature. It is really a book for those who want to learn beyond the surface of the revolution. For those who want to move beyond just the biographies of Washington and learn about the other players that assisted the founding fathers (and worked against them) than this is a great book for you.

John Hancock by Harlow Unger is an excellent addition to the literature on the Revolutionarily War. It takes a very fresh approach to the often stale ideas of why the revolution started. It alleges that the early phase of the push towards war had little to do with liberty and everything to do with personal vendetta and economics. He clearly articulates the personal animosity of Otis and Sam Adams towards the royal governor and their constant push to rally the mob via the Sons of Liberty. Also shown is the merchant class led by Hancock who felt the squeeze of British taxes and policies and pushed back with their agents in London. As the situation became untenable in London it became necessary for the merchants via Hancock to take control of the mobs and direct their focus. One of the most important contributions to the Revolution that Hancock makes is the funding. At various points Hancock is almost singlehandedly funding out of his own pocket and raising money via the merchant class to buy guns, pay troops, and cover the expenses of entertaining diplomats.There are a few problems with this book that do need to be addressed. The author points out that Hancock was in the right place at the right time in many cases and often ended up in his positions via luck more than political maneuvering. The author credits Hancock with being ahead of the curve each time and in some cases this is simply not true when events were started by others. There is a clear distaste for John Adams and while post revolution it is easy to find fault with the Jacobin tendencies it seems he is treated very harsh by Unger.Overall it is still refreshing to see a different take on why the revolution started and looking past the Sam Adams bias it is a four start book. Highly recommended for those who have read a lot of American Revolution and are looking for a fresh approach.

Unger delivers another packed biography in his assessment of Lafayette's role in two worlds. Focusing on his role in both of the major revolutions in the eighteenth century in the British colonies and the United States the author seeks to place Lafayette in the world. Lafayette is heralded as the great white knight who sprang from the old world to save the new world, only to not have a place in that new world. Overall this is a fascinating thesis on the changing values of liberalism particularly with regard to the French revolutions barbarity and extremism against symbols like Lafayette. The book focuses on a lot of details and uses a lot of historical documents. I do agree with other reviewers that there are some errors but overall they don't distract from his main thesis or points. What I found most bothersome and the reason for one star being taken off was that the biography was so pro Lafayette you would be led to believe that he single handedly won the revolution and started the French Revolution. Taken into context this book tells a great story and is useful for those looking for a quick narrative but its conclusions need to be taken in context of all the factors surrounding these complex events.

The Incas and the conquest of Peru are two of the most interesting stories in latin American history. This book captures the whole of that story and in wonderful detail relates the invasion of Pizzaro and the fall of the Incas. From Manco Inca to Tuti Cosi the Inca rebellions raged against Spanish occupation and eventually resulted in the free Inca state of Villacamba. In the end this state was doomed to fall to Spanish greed but the attempts at the Incas to preserve sovereignty is impressive. The writing style is excellent and the book is a very quick read. If you want to get a start on learning about the Inca's there is not a better book out there. If you are starting a study of South America as a whole this is an essential addition to that library. Highly recommend.

Emory Thomas gives a southerners perspective on the life of Robert E. Lee. The preface of this book gives the reader a sense that they will be given a pro-southern view of the war and while that is true at times the biography is generally balanced well. Lee is portrayed as a hero which he was to the south and shown as a military genius which was mostly true. Lee accomplished amazing things by bold actions and the principles of movement and concentration. This book tracks his childhood where he lived in the shadow of a father who was a failure. It then moves to his years at West Point where he excelled and graduated at the top of his class. He was given several assignments across the country from building a fort in Savannah to defending the Mississippi near St. Louis. He even spent time in New York City rebuilding forts there before heading off to war in the 1848 Mexican American War. Lee served with distinction in the war and learned a great deal from Winfield Scott about fighting an offensive war with smaller numbers than the enemy. He would take these lessons to heart against the north.Lee would refuse both the United States Army and the Confederacy when they offered him posts in their armies. It was only when his home state of Virginia left the union that he accepted command of all Virginia militias. As the militias were absorbed into the army Lee found himself without a command. Jefferson Davis would use Lee as a roving advisor helping to make overall strategic decisions, a sort of Halleck of the South initially. Lee would eventually take command of the army once Johnston was sent out to command the Army of Tennessee. This would be a post that Lee kept throughout the entire war. Lee was able to achieve stunning victories by daring action but in the end resources were against him. Lee correctly believed that his army had to achieve victory very quickly because a war of attrition favored the north. Unfortunately for Lee he was at times too bold and all of the battles are categorized well here. For a book written in 1995 there is a good deal of attention paid to the west which is now considered a vital battlefield. Lee was forced to surrender after a vicious battle near Appomattox courthouse where PA miners actually blew up a whole underneath his army. Lee won daring defensive victories but each time his army was smaller and his position more tenuous. After the war Lee accepted a post to become President of Washington College in Lexington. It was a post he would excel at. Lee would not become a citizen of the union until historians discovered his petition in 1975 when Congress made him a citizen again. This biography provides an excellent and balanced look at Robert E. Lee's life. I would highly recommend for Civil War scholars who want an updated biography and one that is not too biased in one direction.

This book simply got too bogged down in details and was poorly written. It is a very interesting subject but I simply could not get into it the way it was organized and written. The book jumps around and does not go into much of the naval history of the importance of corsairs. Overall very disappointed from a book that should have been very interesting and exciting to study.

For those looking for urban history and political discontent this book has it all. This covers the time in the civil war focusing mostly on the 1863 draft riots in New York City. It is a convoluted story that Professor Spann tries to sort out doing an excellent job. This was one of the first books I read on the civil war and it gives a very different perspective than you can get anywhere else. It is an enjoyable read and is a great addition to the urban history of New York City.

This book is an excellent display of how the French and Indian war fits into a European context. The only reason I would not give it five stars is that it loses the global context that is really essential to the war. Fowler covers not only the crucial Indian involvement but the sheer hopelessness of a French Victory. He clearly lays out how the war unfolded and what each side had to gain. He shows how the British reorganize their systems in America and bring about an eventual victory. The British victory is put in the context of what it means for the American Revolution a little over a decade away.

If you want to understand how the French Revolution changed the common people of France this is a great way to start. The book is a bit dated but still stands up very well and Hunt's credentials are excellent. This book also talks about some of the symbols of the revolution and makes for an interesting analysis on the side. The politics goes through quite a bit of the revolution but it is fairly scattered (like most Hunt books are). If you are reading about the French Revolution this is a great addition to your reading list.

Patrick Henry is one of the forgotten founding fathers despite heralding one of the most famous lines of the revolution "Give me Liberty or give me Death". His role in military affairs, government as an anti-federalist, and as governor of Virginia was pivotal acts in the revolution. Henry served with George Mason as the primary anti-federalist and arguing against the addition of a large government with enumerated powers and felt the only way to defend liberty was through a bill of rights. This bill would guarantee the peoples freedoms against an encroaching government. Patrick Henry was the master of back door politics despite his distaste for it and even carried on an illegal war in the Virginia back county almost leading to a siege of Detroit. The state of Virginia at the time of the Civil War was largely through his efforts and his expedition that took significant territory from what might have been PA or MD.One of the most interesting parts of this book is the idea that Patrick Henry represented the common man and was truly the peoples voice during the debates in Virginia and Philadelphia always arguing for the rights. The author does a very good job of making this case and I find it very hard to refute. Henry's speaking ability was undisputed as a man of the people and a person who could get crowds energized and excited. He seemed to thrive off that attention using his background as a man of the people (not of the landed gentry) to draw his audience in.For those looking for a different take not often discussed in the literature and really seeing something from the anti-federalist point of view I highly recommend this book.

If there was ever a book that shows how the founder of a company was ignorant about what his company has become this book is it. This is a charming picture of how Starbucks is supposed to run. It does provide some interesting points about the early start of the business and strategies for growth. Overall though I think the reader is captured by how much the starbucks described is different from the starbucks everyone knows and visits today. Schultz vision has been lost in corporate America and hyper growth strategies. Still very interesting and well worth the time to read.

This book attempts to analyze the relationship between Austria and Germany from the years 1935-1945. The bulk of the book is dedicated to what happened as the Germans exercised more and more control during the war years. It looks at the state of Jews in Austria as well as the economy and military situation. The people of the region never developed a national loyalty to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria or Germany because of the changes taking place. The loyalties would be established in the post war era and this book shows how Germany tried to fill the void. The soviets and their relentless attacks would wreak havoc on the population and eventually pull them apart. The downside to this book is that it is very slow reading and not interesting prose. Much of it is dry and the analysis is not obvious at times. If you have patience and are interested in this topic you will get a lot out of this book otherwise I would not even try.

David McCullough does an excellent job of providing a general overview of the American Revolution in the year 1776. The book begins in England with King George III speaking to Parliament and declaring his resolve to destroy the insurrection. It then heads on to Boston and the siege there showing the confusion on both sides of the war. After the evacuation of Boston we see the invasion of New York in very good detail. This tracks Washington's retreat and subsequent defeats in Canada and Lee's capture. The final part of the book focuses on Trenton and Princeton attacks. My biggest complaint and the reason this book gets three stars is the analysis is almost nonexistent. It tells the story but really jumps around and does not present a logical progression. I am a big fan of McCullough's other books such as Adams or Truman but this one was a letdown. If you really want to look at this I suggest reading Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fisher. If you are just starting out reading the American Revolution this is a fine book to start with but if you really want to delve into the issues look elsewhere.

George Tenet in his book At the Center of the Strom takes readers through his time as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). At the time this position included the running of the CIA, being responsible for coordinating information from all intelligence agencies and being the primary supplier of intelligence information to the president. The book is written in a very straight talk manner and is easy to follow. Tenet who served an abnormally long tenure through two presidents as DCI made several contributions to defining the way we approach the war on terror. The start of the war in Afghanistan was primarily a CIA directed effort and much of the thinking on how to fight terrorism had come in the CIA think tanks prior to 9/11. His story conforms with much that has been written in the 9/11 commission and by books from authors such as Richard Clarke so while not a lot of new things are available for the reader we do receive more confirmation on what likely happened in the months leading up to 9/11 and the day of the event.There are several nuggets in this book that are new to the readers and provide a great look at what was happening about terrorism during Tenet's 7 year tenure. One is the inside look at the peace process under Clinton and what went wrong with Arafat at the end of 2000. This is largely confirmed by other sources but Tenet tells the story the best. The dismantling of the A. Q. Kahn nuclear network is another great covered gem that provides readers access to one of the more chilling events in U. S. Intelligence history. From tracking down the Pakistani network to the surrendering of Libya's nuclear program the story is worth reading about.Finally the last third of the book is spent on the war in Iraq and trying to have damage control about the CIA's role. Tenet tries to vigorously defend himself from his "Slam Dunk" comment that gave Colin Powell the information needed to go to the UN to justify war. As of now we still don't have enough accounts but it sounds like these words were used and the strenuous defense Tenet makes was hard to swallow especially when we goes on to say that Powell's presentation was very good and credible. While I have no doubt Tenet did explain the lack of intelligence I am left believing he did make the comment. It is fairly easy to infer that Tenet thought the war in Iraq was a mistake and no steps were taken to plan an exit strategy.Overall this is a great read that while a little long will hold your interest. Tenet talks straight and addresses a wide range of subjects over a pivotal point in our history. He comes off as more honest and less biased compared to some who have written on this time frame. Finally one of the reasons I always like to read political books like this is not only to get the story at the time but to see what a day in the life of that high government position that few Americans will ever have the chance to hold. Tenet does a great job of showing what life as a DCI was like and how it can impact your family. A great book and one I highly encourage to be read.

Ciano's Diaries are an invaluable resource to scholars who want to study the diplomacy of the Nazi's and Italy in World War 2. For those who are just causal readers of history these diaries will probably not be of interest. For the scholars of Europe they are essential. These are great and honest reports of what Italy under Mussolini was thinking. This first diary shows the years when Ciano was in agreement with the Duce and their policy was one of harmony. The original designs on Albania are clearly traced out and Ciano's resentment of the German's is clear. He is very pro-German to begin with but as Munich and time goes on he begins to distrust their policy. Highly recommended resource for World War 2.

Walter Laqueur provides one of the most concise overviews of Fascism in it is various stages. The book is divided into three pieces with the first covering the historical aspects of Fascism from the 1930's with Hitler and Mussolini. The present in the second half covers the post world war II era through the 1990's and the way that neofacist and skinhead movements changed fascism face. Finally the last part covers the evolution of fascism in post soviet republics and Middle Eastern countries. My one major complaint of the book is that it tends to focus far more on Nazi Germany and leaves out Italy's contribution to the ideology of Fascism. While the book tries to do a lot in a very short number of pages it tends to focus on Nazi Germany and then expand on the Nazi contributions to the present and fascist era. To be certain it mentions Italy many times but never really assesses Mussolini's fascism. Overall though this is an excellent overview of fascism and very well written for those interested in either a historical or a philosophical case study of this ideology.

Hopkirk delivers a wonderful book in his look at how the British Empire was forced to respond to Germany's attempts to destroy its empire. The book is the most terrifying installment of the series as Hopkirk describes Germany's efforts to raise a holy war in the Middle East. The efforts of the British to stop it are impressive and once again show the triumph and finesse of the British imperial system. This is another fascinating book that looks at how the British empire lasted throughout the turbulent years of world war 1. As always the book is very well written and impressively displayed.

Urban history of European capitals has become a popular thing to write about it and Large does not disappoint. This tracks Berlins troubled history from the early days, through Prussia, German dominance, reforms by Hitler to the modern day with the renovations of Alexander square. Like most of these books if you have never visited the city it will not hold the same allure. For those who have been to Berlin this is well worth reading and getting a sense of the city. It is clearly written and does not get bogged down on details. It is through enough without making it a year by year update of the changes. It covers the social and political aspects as well. Overall if you want to know about how Berlin developed this is the only book for you.

How Dell Does it looks at the existing model of direct to the customer the Michael Dell built and assess the various scenarios where market efficiencies and strategies have been carved out to apply those to business lessons. It focuses on flexibility, speed, innovation, and fluid inventory to achieve superior results and new ideas. From prompt customer service (in house even) to customization, at a time when the computer choices were the equivalent of black or black ala Henry Ford, this book covers the strategies that made Dell a wining company. I do agree with the other reviewers that editing was badly needed and chapters repeated themselves and did not flow together. It was more a series of independent articles that were cobbled together into a book but the information is still strong and good analysis is provided. It gets a little pedantic at times and bogged down in terminology but for those with a true business interest they will get a lot out of the book as opposed to the casual reader. Overall a solid analysis of Dell but could have been pulled off more fluidly.

As someone who has written a lot on Bill Clinton I eagerly awaited the release of his biography. It met most of my expectations although at times he put in far more than I needed to or cared to know. Nigel Hamilton does an excellent job in his early years biography and it matches most of what Clinton talks about here. The need for Bill Clinton to please everyone around him really comes out in his own biography and while I feel he skirts around his disagreement with Carter and does not express the anger that most sources say he felt it is a very honest attempt. I would have liked more details about his college years and meeting Hillary which he jumps past fairly quickly and gets into their political relationship. It is very well written which is to be expected from someone as educated as Bill Clinton.

As someone who has written a lot about Bill Clinton over the years I was disappointed by his book. This was a chance for him to set the record straight on both the good and bad in his administration and he did neither. He talks about a lot of the issues but not how he approached them. He talks about what his administration looked at but not what he did and did not solve. He allows Yassir Arafat to get off completely free for his rejection of the Clinton plan the book is very well written and is still worth reading if nothing else to understand Clinton's perspective on what happened but overall it could have been far more enlightening.

This is a truly fascinating book about the early years in Manhattan and the effect of Minuet on how the city was laid out. As interesting as New York is Minuet's effects on Philadelphia and the Swedish efforts to make a competing colony after he is rejected from New York. The development of the city is a watershed in United States history. This book is written very slowly and is read the same way. Each sentence is clearly chosen very carefully but the reading is somewhat labored at times. Overall it is an enjoyable book and is useful in understanding how this pivotal city was formed. For those looking to understand early urban history this is an essential book to add to the collection.

This book is a very chilling read into how clinical depression was overcome. It is a very quick read totaling only 84 pages and provides stunning detail into how the mind works. It is a very interesting book for those in the health profession or those with just a casual interest in medicine. It is an excellent textbook for classes who want to talk about clinical depression as a disease that has to be cured. Stryon's efforts were truly impressive and shed light on a very important disease that needs to be fought with newer medicines.

This is the best written biography of Fidel Castro. It covers almost all of his life focusing mostly on the political and military aspects. If you want to get a sense of society as a whole I would recommend reading Fidel Castro by Quirk but otherwise this is an excellent start to Castro's life. You could read this and feel that you have covered every relevant part of his life and then some. If you want to understand how Cuba was transformed into what it is today this is essential reading. Highly recommend.

Fragmented metropolis provides an excellent look at how Los Angeles rose from a Pueblo town to be the predominant West Coast city and one of the largest cities in the country. The development of the railroads and the municipal struggles that prevented centralized mass transit leading to the rise of the automobile are all covered here. The author is one the distinct noted urban historians in the country and despite this being his earliest work it is still a masterpiece. What has been defined as a classic of urban history showing how a city can be broken into pieces and still remain unified provides insight into the Los Angeles we know today. As an interesting side bar in this story is the comparison of San Diego to LA and how each battled it out from dominance of southern California during the time period of 1850-1930. Overall this book provides an excellent comparison of industry, demographics, local politics and business history to show how Los Angeles developed in the modern city that it would become following World War II through the actions taken in this time period. Well worth the time for those who want to take a look at an earlier yet pivotal part of Los Angeles development.

This is one of the most thorough accounts of Mussolini and the Italy's foray into the World War. The author provides an almost overly thorough analysis with literally almost every sentence packing maximum information punch. If you want to have a one book summary of how Italy became involved in war in Europe this is a great start. It glazes over some areas but when it comes to the time period covered this literally is a day by day and event by event account of the war. Top notch analysis provides wonderful diplomatic discussion and very clear conclusions. For those interested in diplomatic history this is a great book to take a look at. I have read over thirty books related to Mussolini and world war II and this is easily in the top three.

This book is a very thorough overview of how war broke out between Ethiopia and Africa. It looks at the causes of conflict between Ethiopia as a developed state that fought to gain access to the League of Nations and vanquished a semi modern European army in Italy. It also looks at Italy's desire to enter the world stage and invade the only colony that remained in Africa. While they had limited territory Mussolini's desire to invade Ethiopia overrode many common sense decisions. The war was seen in Europe as an act of aggression and condemned by the League. It created a dilemma for France and Britain who wanted to preserve the Stressa Front but was forced to put sanctions to Italy in order to uphold the league breaking the diplomatic isolation of Germany. This gave Hitler his indication to find an ally and his belief that the league was ineffectual. Overall this book does an excellent job of assessing a conflict that has received little press. Highly recommend for those studying the causes of World War II.

This book is a valiant attempt to cover an interesting topic but in the end it just comes up short. It is very badly written and the prose is so academic that it does not even hold a candle to other books on the subject. (see any of Peter Hopkirk books). The book goes into voluminous detail that the only advantage is you get it in one book instead of five smaller ones. Overall though I would recommend you go with the five smaller ones which give you more detail and a better written story. Meyer just could not pull it off on this one which is unfortunate for such an interesting topic.

Asprey writes the best biography of Napoleon in his two book series. This first book deals with Napoleons younger years and obsession with Alexander the Great taking us through the revolution where he delivered his "whiff of grapeshot" that would give him his first commands. The analysis is through and done well leaving little out. The prose is engaging and this is one of the better written biographies from this period. If you are looking for an introduction to Napoleon or are an avid fan that wants to read something engaging this two book series is a great choice.

This book is another great addition to the Pivotal moments in American history series. This series seeks to assess the events that led to a major paradigm shift in American history changing the country in some way. The argument here is that the Freedom Rides established a basis for social justice that had not been achieved previously. With this topic the author does an excellent job of putting a human face on the struggle the riders went through and you can feel the palpable hatred that the riders experienced and the racism is simply nauseating. It is unbelievable how clear the author captures it and not only for the hate towards the riders but the strict values that held this racism in place. What many people saw as right was the destruction of the freedom riders. The author does an excellent job at explaining the dichotomy in the country and showing how the Freedom Rides changed the perception of everyone towards social justice issues. For the first time white and black worked together not always seamlessly but with greater fervor than ever before. The direct action campaigns shifted focuses on what was happening the country creating new challenges. The book is extensively researched and relies not only on newspapers but countless interviews and the author should be commended for the work he put in. An excellent book to read and highly recommended.

Broken Spears does something very interesting in his book that no one else has ever tried to do. He approaches the invasion of Mexico from the perspective of the Aztecs. He looks at the court of Montezuma and tells us how the invasion looked from their perspective. This is a very astute look at the invasion and one of the most unique out there. It is very well written and holds the readers interest. The biggest downfall of the book is that if you are not familiar with the story you will find it lacking in information. It assumes a great deal of information about the invasion that can be gotten from other books. It also takes into account the rise and fall of Montezuma and how the kingdom was not as unified as it appeared. If you are going to study Latin American history than this is a must read.

Doc Holliday by Gary Roberts is one of the definitive books on the history of the west and the life and times of Tombstone. It is expertly researched, well written and thoroughly tracks the life of Doc Holliday and his compatriots in the west. The book does not assume anything and takes stock in what researches no. It is an academic text but I don't feel that it detracts from the book itself and in reality offers a richer and more accurate account of Doc Holliday's life whether it is the episodes in Georgia, Tombstone or his time traveling around the west. A clear picture of western justice is painted and the politics of the time are very clearly shown. For those who want to see what life in the west was like Roberts does an excellent job of presenting that. There are so few high quality academic books written on the west that this is truly a welcome addition for those wishing to study western history. It focuses on his life and how the legends around his life were created. Enjoyable whether you have read a lot or a little but regardless you are sure to learn a lot.

Jane Merritt makes an excellent addition to the discussion of Indians in the Mid-Atlantic region during the age of empire. This is a complex topic and Merritt does an excellent job of sorting it out. On that note this is a complex topic and this is not a book a novice in the subject would want to start with. It assumes knowledge of the Iroquois and the covenant chain as well as the Seven Years war. (See my other reviews for suggestions on those topics).Merritt's book analyzes a variety of cross sections of Delaware Indian culture and their relation with Pennsylvania's (Quakers, proprietors, and frontiersman), Iroquois, and the French. She looks at the role of language, women and religion and how these each affected the relationships between the various groups. Utilizing sources from local to state level she is able to get at a large cross section that allows for significant corroboration. Unlike many where there is an Indian view and a colonial view in this case there we have a variety of colonial sources since they each represented a different viewpoint. The book chronologically covers the famed Walking Purchase during the time of William Penn to the conclusion of the Seven Years War (French and Indian War) and how it shaped the frontier. The idea that Indians and colonists lived at a crossroads where trade dictated interactions are thoroughly explored. For those who want to gain a greater understanding of the Mid-Atlantic world in colonial times you cannot go wrong with this book.

Santoli presents one of the best views of the Vietnam war in his simple approach that says far more than many of the other accounts. It takes a look at 33 people from soldiers to CIA to nurses and tracks their experiences and memoirs form the war. These are sometimes very short no more than a page and the longest ranges about 10 pages. It is very clearly written and the interviews are top notch. It is one of the few books that shows how horrifying it was to be a non combatant as well as a combatant. The nature of the war is expressed clearer here than most books that focus on a specific battle. It is really possible to see the genesis of the whole war. This is a must have for any Vietnam war scholar.

Paul Bremer provides a clear and concise look at the state of affairs in Iraq under the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) during his tenure as the head of Iraq. There are many lessons to be learned from what happened in Iraq and the understanding that this was to be the largest reconstruction project since Germany and Japan is often lost on many people who study this area. It is amazing to see the state that Saddam had driven the country to during his tenure. A moderate middle class was completely destroyed, technocrats were virtually eliminated and the prized Saddam army vanished into almost thin air soon after the occupation began. What is also clear from Bremer's account is that the United States and its allies had no plan whatsoever for how they were going to shape postwar Iraq. From bureaucratic struggles to the confusion on command and control structures (CPA was transferred from Defense to NSC midway through his tenure) the situation in Iraq was a mess even before the CPA got started.Now the main problem with this book is simply a lack of sources. We have someone who reports on a lot of private meetings but we have no way to verify what actually occurred. There are no corroborating documents available from either intelligence, military or domestic source to help compare this account. This book can only serve as a firsthand account from Paul Bremer's point of view and while that should not be dismissed out of hand just because of lack of supporting evidence it does need to be taken with caution. For those who are looking at what happened in Iraq from someone who was on the ground this is an interesting book to read but more reading to understand the whole story is in order.

Storm over Texas provides an excellent overview of the political turmoil that occurred between 1844 and the election of Lincoln. As part of the pivotal movements in American history series the book strives to show how this event was a significant shift in the course of United States history and in the end it succeeds. Texas proved to be a catalyst for the political disunion that lead to the Civil War. The great enemy throughout this process according to this interpretation was former president Martin Van Buren and his involvement is one of the more interesting things to be gleamed from this version of events. Like many books in this series it takes a controversial viewpoint and defends it fairly well. It is a very difficult viewpoint to sell especially given the amount of research that has been done on this point. If you are just starting out on this area of history you will probably find this book interesting. For those that have read a lot on the civil war the argument will be fun but the book will be a fast read. Overall give it a chance and get a look at a great new argument but one that is not likely to sway a lot of people.

Nixon and Mao provides a great look at how these two enemies came together to begin a rapprochement that would change the dynamic of modern world history and begin to crumble the traditional roles of the Cold War. It would bring a president whose paranoia matched those of the people he negotiated with. Margaret MacMIllain does a superb job of blending together the complex array of issues facing a negotiation with the Chinese. From Kissinger's secret visit via Pakistan to the handshake that changed modern times all of the events are explained succinctly and in very thoughtful detail throughout the book.While this trip was not heavy on substance or details it provided the symbolic importance of establishing Nixon as a premier foreign policy president and delivered a setback against the Russians. While the Japanese and the Taiwanese were scared at a possible rapprochement between the United States and China they were reassured by Kissinger and Nixon that this thaw was for the better. It did not lead to a solution in Vietnam but did contribute to a commercial opportunity for American markets (and some might argue for our eventual economic downfall and rise of Chinese prominence.) By meeting Mao in person and working through Chou (Chinese foreign minister) Nixon and Kissinger were able to pull of a diplomatic coup d'&eacute;tat that few thought possible at that time in world history.For those who want to read a top notch diplomatic history that covers the political, economic and social ramifications in a succinct and thoughtful manner than this is the book for you. With just the right amount of detail MacMillian delivers another historical blockbuster that is well worth the time to read.

Ruth Cowan attempts to show how technology has developed since the colonial days through the present trends of biotechnology. This is a daunting task and it is pulled off as well as can be expected. There is a lot of information to be found here but a great deal more is missing. This book is still the best general overview on the history of technology and while more can be done this is a good start. If you want to understand how technology shaped our society you can't go wrong with this book.The early chapters on the colonial economy are very well done and tightly analyzed. After that it starts to spread apart a little and the technology jumps around. The transportation revolution chapter is one of the more disappointing for me. While she does a decent job on the railroads she completely misses the significance of the canals on the early development in America. Her chapters on innovation and technological systems provide nice summaries of the relevant literature. Most of the chapters leading up to the twentieth century are filler that really don't address too many technological issues. The automobile chapter tries to do an amazingly quick history of cars and a lot gets left out in the process with even more wrong. The communications chapter does a better job of showing the evolution while looking at the technologies. The history of the military-academic-industrial complex provides an interesting look at how the Manhattan Project and NASA changed the way technology was developed. Cowan does a very good job on this particular topic and it is probably her best chapter in the later part of the book. The final chapter is on biotechnology and covers genetic corn, birth control and penicillin. These advancements while important are not really given justice.

This is a very random but interesting collection of stories from the gold rush to the civil war in California but lacked a solid thesis to connect them together. The book does do an excellent job of showing how California became a state via its population boom. It tracks the lives of those who impacted California from the Pathfinder, to Thomas Hart Benton and Jefferson Davis as well as the players within California many of whom would shape the transcontinental railroad. As noted by an earlier review it does provide a very interesting glimpse as to why the territories of California, Nevada and Colorado/Utah became the states that they did through the slavery question and how California was forced to remain together rather than try to solve the national slave problem from the local perspective. For those looking for more on the history of California and want to learn more about the little known stories this is a great book to start doing so but it does not tell a coherent story and remains a random collection.

This book provides a basic overview of state policy and how it is represented through various lenses. Politicians, common people and businesses are all considered. The basic types of state level taxes and the reasons for their collection are all outlined. While sales taxes are among the most important they are also are supplemented by direct federal government grants. There is a lot of useful information here but the reader should be wary. The author makes a lot of opinionated claims and sites only his own work to support them. There are several things in here that are open to dispute and I would use this book as an introduction only. It does do a wonderful job of categorizing all of the issues and giving a springboard for further study. For those interested in public policy this is an essential book to have on hand for framing state tax issues.

The question of whether or not Mussolini sought to rebuild the Roman Empire during his reign has never been truly answered and this book does not seek to do so. While mistitled the book does offer a very good account and narrative of Mussolini's tenure in office. It is a basic overview of foreign policy and how the world viewed Italy during his reign. Dennis Mack Smith is an excellent historian and his biography of Mussolini is among the best that can be found although it is written more than a decade after this book. This is a great start to understanding what occurred via Italy during the World War II era. The book goes beyond a simple biography of Mussolini and does try to take in a snapshot of Italy as a whole. It is a decent place to start for a narrative but this should not be taken as the complete picture. RJ Bosworth's newest book Mussolini's Italy is a great source for what occurred in Italy both domestically and from a foreign policy perspective. While this book was great at the time it was published one can probably find more complete references elsewhere. The information here is still mostly good and has been challenged in some ways but it can be an excellent start to understanding Italy in World War II.

This is part two of the best biography of Napoleon that I have read. It is a focus on political and military history but does a decent job of covering the social aspects of napoleon's reforms. This book really focuses on the Napoleonic empire and its eventual fall. It also covers his return to power and does an excellent job of presenting the information clearly. The prose is well done and really makes for quick and interesting reading. This is a must have for anyone studying this era.

At Rainbow's End provides a succinct yet through look at the Great Depression and how it changed life in America. By tracking the prosperities of the 1920s and the rise of consumer culture the reader gets a clear picture of the investment frenzy that gripped the nation. The over valuation of stocks and the financial crisis is clearly laid out in laymen's terms with an overview for those who want the technical financial explanation. It tracks interesting vignettes and mini biographies of major players and how they affected and were changed by the depression. It does not look at the solutions to the depression, only the causes. This is an average entry into the Pivotal Moments in American history. The problem is that this is such a no brainier event for the series that it does not take much convincing and this book does not try to do so. Instead it tries to give a social perspective which while new and different may not excite all readers. It is still a great book and one that provides a new perspective. For those interested in the roaring twenties it is a great book to look at.

This is the classic book on the British annexation of Africa and although dated still provides some of the best analysis. The book explores the reasons for the partitions of Africa and the course of empire there. It primarily focuses on the last 30 years but does cover the build up to that point. From Cecil Rhodes to the French in Sudan all the crises are explored. The one hard part with this book is that there is little explanation of the British home situation. You are told that Ireland is the focus at times and the various governments but no detail is spared about those governments so to truly appreciate it you need a good background in British politics. Nonetheless if you are trying to understand how Africa developed into what it is today or the course of British Empire there this is an essential book to read.This book will lead you to surprising conclusions about imperialism in Africa. The most amazing part is the British reluctance to take part in the classical imperialist model and focus instead on the proliferation of free trade. In the end fervent African nationalism forced a course of classical imperialism that provoked events like the Boer War. These were generally very reluctantly entered into and the British public back home had little stomach for these conflicts. When exploring them the reader may find the Oxford History of the British Empire a useful companion to fill in more details on various events.

Robert Caro's biography is one of the great series ever written. This first book looks at the things that shaped LBJ's early life. The first part is focused on the parents and grandparents of LBJ. The times growing up in Texas were very interesting to read about and while I was afraid this book would not be interesting I was proven wrong quickly. The hill country is a fascinating place and you can see the poverty that Texas experienced even before the depression. Most striking is Lyndon Johnson's childhood where he was an almost constant terror to his parents who loved him anyway. He would runaway constantly. After running away to California he came back and was involved in a series of local gangs and street races. His parents were finally able to talk some sense into him and he went to collegeLyndon Johnson continued his pompous attitude at college and was notable for creating the political scene at Southwest Texas teachers college. He was constantly in debt during his college years but played the political game well becoming friends with the president of the university and other top students. Although leaving college several times hew as able to thrive there. He was able to gain a job in Washington DC as a congressman's aide afterwards and built his power base.Lyndon Johnson was an expert at the political game and he played it well in DC. This book categorizes his rise from congressman's aide to congressman in the 10th district. It shows how he built his network, worked with and against Sam Rayburn, FDR and his wife Lady Bird. Through it all he truly is shown as a manipulator and an expert political operator. He is morally reprehensible as a person throughout the entire book which was not something I expected to find. For a book about LBJ's early years this is absolutely amazing. It is so well written and you cannot wait to read what is in store next. I cannot wait to read the next three books in the series!

This book offers an excellent overview of the United Nations and the various arms that exist within its alphabet soup. The authors approach the subject through several theoretical lenses and look at world order and how the United Nations has shaped it and what that order will look like in the future with the UN. The authors break the book into three interrelated areas of security, human rights and economic development/globalization. Each area is looked at in three pieces that are broad in scope. The first is the historical perspective of how the UN has approached each area, then a current look at how the UN is doing and finally what role will the UN play in the future. In the last part it is a look at how world order is structured because of UN actions. The book is very well written and is almost a modern classic for those who study international relations and want to understand how the UN fits into the world. No matter the stance on pro or anti UN this is a great book to start understanding what role the UN plays in the world and a masterpiece of scholarship.

Kurlansky is usually known for writing more off the wall histories so I was fairly surprised to see this one. Despite his eclectic nature this book is very well done and really highlights how 1968 was a defining year for the world. From riots in the United States to the Prague Spring Kurlansky goes through the traumatic events of the year. He ties them together and although he does not offer a definite thesis it still makes for interesting reading.

The Greek war for intendance from the Ottoman Empire is an interesting story but there is something lacking from this book. This book does lay out the basic facts that you need but I found it to be somewhat schizophrenic. The nationality of Greece is born out of this civil war and Brewer does a decent job of explaining that. As another reviewer mentioned there is a fascinating look at a secret society that then disappears for the rest of the book. Overall it is just a mediocre book that had great potential but lacked in execution.

This is a truly fascinating book that takes the American Revolution completely from the British perspective. If you are not well versed in the events of the American Revolution this will be a tough book to get through because it does not spend much time talking about what happens on the American side and you are assumed to know. If you are a true student of the American revolution however this is a must read. To understand the British thinking is somewhat shocking and to see the changes in government and how it impacted the war in America brings a new perspective to the Revolution. Very highly recommend for those who are well versed in the American Revolution.

The quest to find the cure for Polio is one of the most interesting medical stories in history. How did a disease that was not a major threat compared to Influenza, cancer or heart disease capture the nations attention and spend millions if not billions in a search for a cure. The answer is miraculously in the private sector where the national foundation harnessed the resources of a nation to bring together top scientific talent. The real story lies behind two scientists, Salk and Sabin, who would race to find a cure. Salk who would win the race with his dead virus vaccine was the vaccine that would be given to most of the nation initially. The newest in vaccine technology and the original research however was being done by Sabin whose vaccine in the end would be used up through the present day. This book does a wonderful job of showing the rancor between these two men and the scientists who lined up beside them. It shows FDR's involvement in helping to launch the national foundation and the first March of Dimes which continues even into today. Highly recommend for those who want to see how one disease affected this country and how the struggle to cure it launched our modern pharmaceutical industry.

Ciano's Diaries are an invaluable resource to scholars who want to study the diplomacy of the Nazi's and Italy in World War 2. For those who are just causal readers of history these diaries will probably not be of interest. For the scholars of Europe they are essential. These are great and honest reports of what Italy under Mussolini was thinking. Ciano's second set of diaries paints the dark days of World War 2 for Italy and how the regime was on the brink of collapsing. Ciano himself would be executed as a traitor by the end but he and a small group worked to preserve Italy. The diplomatic maneuverings between the Germans, Russians and the Allies are captured here in unabashed detail making for interesting reading. For those who want to understand the diplomatic realties of World War 2 this is essential.

Seth Mallois delivers an interesting anthropological/historical book on trade patterns in the early Chesapeake area. He follows three different colonies and their attempts to start up and looks at the demise and troubles through the lens of trade. Using anthropological techniques he establishes a model based on trading patterns of societies which show how cultures expect to give and receive when they are establishing relations.The first colony Ajacan is a Spanish colony where Spaniards take food and give back holy sacraments leaving the Indians feeling cheated. One of the Indians who had traveled to Spain named Don Louis eventually tells the Spanish they will help build the church if they can borrow axes and promptly hack the Spanish to death keeping the axes as payment.The second colony tracked was the failed British colony at Roanoke which is covered in exquisite detail. It is very hard to find a concise summary of this doomed colony and it really falls to anthropologists and archeologists to do so as we don't have many documents giving us the details. We can see that the British lack of understating in relation to the culture of the Indians spurred many of the arguments that took place. The early trade was done well but lack of supplies and taking advantage of the Indians wore thin leading to attacks on the colony. Many Indians also saw the giving of European diseases which they believed Europeans controlled as tantamount to war and required sharp reprisals against the colonists.The third colony of Jamestown provides the best studies as there are written documents that outline what happened very closely. Although in the case of the John Smith diaries there are some exaggerations it does provide a very complete picture with regard to trading in the area. Overall John Smith understood the Indians and was able to keep the peace by moderating the rates of exchange and controlling the goods that flowed into the market. This control ensured stable prices and kept exchange congenial. When Smith is sent home after being injured the colonies notice a sharp upswing in attacks as the markets are flooded and the trusted trading partner is gone. Overall this is an excellent summary of the colonial era and well worth reading if you want to understand the days of the early colonial period.

Ron Chernow has provided an accessible and unbiased account of the life of Rockefeller Senior. It is amazingly well done with excellent detail and research. For those who want to see the early days of the oil industry and the development of the trusts then this is the place to look. Don't be put off by the number of pages as it reads very easy and goes fast leading to an excellent account of a man who is both respected and vilified across historical literature. Chernow strikes a balanced road looking at the business tactics that made Rockefeller infamous combined with the philanthropies that made him a saint to many. The book not only focuses on these ventures but the various Rockefeller family members who shaped Senior's life. All are covered in detail but the focus remains on their impact to Senior. Overall well worth the time and don't miss out on what is sure to be regarded as a historical classic.

The story of Paypal's struggle for World Domination is well told by their former marketing director who joined the company Conformity in its early days. He is a strong supporter of the Paypal Brand and an arch enemy of all things Ebay whose attempts to throw "roadblocks" at the company would almost cause disaster on numerous occasions. This book is very well done with top analysis on the business functions of Paypal. It considers Paypal's inability to get profitable and the problems inherent in its business model to ways that it prepared its consumer base to enjoy the benefits of having a flexible pay service. The internet and computer industry is filled with wonderful business stories and Paypal's is truly near the top. For those who want real business analysis and an understanding of how Silicon Valley works this book cannot be topped.

Burrows and Wallace provide the definitive account on the history of New York City up until the merge of the boroughs into present day Manhattan. Tracing history from its Dutch beginnings, to the English take over, as a seat of revolutionary power and finally finding its place as the financial capital of the United States and eventually the world. The book is detailed and focuses not only on the urban development and political development, but social and demographic changes as well. It is primarily a story of Manhattan but does spend a considerable amount of time on Brooklyn. The Bronx, Long Island and Staten Island are covered sparingly. The political development of New York from the ward bosses to centralized modern government to the corruption of Tammany Hall followed by the successive progressive movement is done very well and the authors are mindful of the competing Dutch and British heritage that give New York a unique flavor. For those who wish to have a complete overview of how modern New York came to be this is the place to start. Do not be deterred by its length for as the other reviews indicate it is not a detriment. It is through, well written and provides top notch analysis into historical developments relating to all areas of New York.

Lee Iacocca is a genius (a little biased as I attend his alma mater). This book tells about the inside story of Ford and his work there. The turn around of Chrysler was a great story and one that bears further study. The downfall of the American automobile industry can be seen here. His extra chapters on how the US should handle foreign debt are practical and it is a shame no one listened when they first came out. While I feel we are in too deep to use them today this is a great book for any business/economics student. It is a great read and very well done.

The role of Andrew Johnson at the end of the Civil war has not been considered by many authors. This book undertakes two tasks. The first is to show the conspiracy behind Booths assignation (and the surrounding plot) and how that conspiracy shaped Andrew Johnson's policies. The second task is to show how the ideas of reconstruction came under development. The writing style is very clear and well done. For those looking for a short and straight to the point book on what happened immediately following the civil war this cannot be beat. Johnson's role as the avenger and the split in the cabinet are some of the most interesting politics in the history of the United States. Mary Todd Lincoln's treatment of Johnson is particularly interesting considering she considered him a part of the assignation. Highly recommend for those who want to learn more about Andrew Johnson.

Ryan Air is the southwest airlines of Europe and has done very well against the inefficient Flag Carriers over there. This book is the story of how that came about and is done very well. My biggest complaint of the book is that the print is way to small. The information is great and the stories told about O'Leahry are very entertaining. If you are looking for a sense of how no frills airlines will succeed this is a great book to read. It really explains the airline business in Europe and is a great comparison for southwest airlines.

The Ordeal of the Longhouse is an excellent start to gaining an understanding of how the Iroquois were affected by the onset of Europeans in their territory. This book does an excellent job of looking at Iroquoian culture and how it developed both before and after Europeans arrived. Europeans changed the cultures of all groups that they interacted with as each took on some of the characteristics of the other and the Iroquois were not exception. Richter takes great detail to play out the various council negotiations and treaty discussions that led to the formation of the five nations council in the view of the Europeans and how this affected diplomacy in the new world. The British, Dutch and French all were forced to deal with the five nations and having a book that so expertly captures their negotiations is wonderful. This is an essential study for anyone who wishes to understand colonial history. While newer books have been coming out on the subject this still remains the gold standard and one of the excellent studies on the Iroquois. A great addition to any colonial or native American historians library.

It is hard to find a travel guide that can thoroughly explain London and this one does not even try. This one takes the most important things and is useful if you are going to be in London from 1-4 days. It has excellent restaurant recommendations and covers the need to see sights. Highly recommend for shorter trips to this amazing city.

Jackson writes one of the seminal studies in urban history relating to the suburbs. The end conclusion is that suburbs have not been beneficial to the United States. This tracks things from the start of suburbanization to the downfall of downtowns. Race relations are a big part of the book as is the heralding of the automobile. Jackson writes very well and the book is wonderfully organized. If you are starting out in urban history this is an essential book to start off with. For those interested in post world war 2 American life this is also a must read.

Gaddis takes an interesting look at how historians have developed the methodologies that make up history. This is an extended survey that considers aspects of biography and the natural sciences. While at times his comparisons can be a stretch there is useful information to be gleamed from this book. First let me start off by saying that this is only for those who really want to look at the philosophical side of why historians write about history. This is not necessarily a book on the how but it explores the perspectives that historians find themselves writing on throughout the course of their works. The comparisons to natural science are either a cry for a more streamlined system of causality or a plea for historians to look at the causal relationships of events. One of the more interesting points Gaddis makes is the idea that historians work backwards to write forwards. We take events that happen in the past and work backwards to find out how they occurred but we present them for our reader in a chronological cause and effect scenario. Overall this is interesting theory but the book wanders too much and really the things he discussed could easily have been said in 75 pages and not 150.

Douglas Farah was not the first person to write about the conflict diamond trade but he was the first one to make the US government pay attention. His discovery that Al Qaeda was funneling their dollars for conflict diamonds so that the bush (not the president) wars could continue. This is truly one of the most horrifying operations occurring in the US where what can only be described as evil is profiting on all sides. It is an easy to read book with an important message. For those who want to learn more about the conflict diamond trade and the problems it causes this is a great book to start with.

This is a great guide for taking with you as you walk around the city. When I first moved to Prague this was my day to day guide for getting around the city. Excellent subway and street map in the back. I highly recommend for planning trips using a bigger guide but this is the one you want to carry around with you when you see the city. Good recommendations on restaurants and sights.

This is the best book in the series on the impact of the road and automobile on American culture. It clearly and concisely assesses how the Motel impacted Americans from the traveling family stopping in motor courts to the modern business traveler staying in Holiday Inn Express or Marriott's. The book focuses less on the package placement academic babble that permeates the rest of the series and more on the historical and cultural aspects of the motel. It traces the evolution from roadside tents, to cabins to motor courts and up to the modern hotel/motel. It has a fascinating chapter on the development of the hotel room and what amenities should be included or not included through historical analysis. For those who really want to understand the history behind hotels this is an excellent place to start and a valuable contribution to urban history.

Why did the urban transportation system in Los Angeles die? This book takes a very multifaceted approach and looks beyond the automobile as its cause. The title is a little misleading. The book covers the downfall of public transpiration in California and how the car impacted life in southern California. There is actually very little urban analysis done here but it covers the public policy of early 1900's very well. You get a sense for how the municipalities and federal government responded in California and see the way in which the auto shaped those policies. The auto was very influential in the downfall of public transportation and I was surprised to see how many auto related interests owned stakes in public transport companies. For those just getting started on urban history this is a good book to start with and he sites the great source on suburbs Crabgrass Frontier (well worth the time to read). Very well written and fun especially if you grew up around LA.

Northern California has needed its own travel book from Eyewitness and this is just the edition I was hoping for. San Francisco has lots of fun places to visit and they are all here. I like that it explains elsewhere to go in the state. If you are looking for a cultural city and a fun camping trip this is the perfect book to buy.

If you are heading to Germany you must get this guide. It was very helpful in planning a trip from Berlin to Munich and the Bavarian Alps. It lays out towns in Germany and what to see in each. We stopped at some wonderful villages on the way and this guide could not be beat. The region by region analysis is great and is useful for planning if you are only heading to one area. If you are just going to Berlin I would get their Berlin guide as this would be a little too much. Otherwise this is the only guide to use for a trip to Germany.

Visiting California with one book is no easy task but Eyewitness does a very good job of creating a book that can be used easily. With so much to do the regionalization of California in this book is one of its most useful aspects. Although I wish they would break it into northern and southern California if you are going to be visiting the state this is a great place to start looking.

Profilo Diaz was the dictator in charge before the Mexican Revolution and the structure of society was clearly coming apart at the seams when he was in power. Beezley does an excellent job of showing how the society was coming apart through various aspects of the culture including religious festivals and life at the Jockey Club. The book is very well written but if you do not know what is happening in Mexico during the Profirian period than this will be a hard book to follow. For those who know a lot about Mexico this is a must read.

Thomas Dewey is one of the forgotten figures in American politics and is explored thoroughly in this book. Dewey built his career the old fashioned way through legal victory and gang busting of the mob. More interesting than the presidential runs is actually his work at developing early thorough investigation techniques coupled with accounting strategies. These early years developed an end to the prohibition era and foreshadowed the rise of the methodical calculating man that would become the guiding light of the Republican Party.Dewey ran for office and failed for a variety of reasons each time. Although coming close to defeating Truman the second time it was a lost cause due to the publics perception of him. He was seen as stiff and unfeeling and the votes always shifted around him. While he was not the warmest candidate he was a great political operator who understood the system. He gathered as many votes as he did through his sheer political brilliance. He became the antithesis of Robert Taft who typified the isolationist branch of the Republican Party. Dewey became the internationalist branch espousing the UN and fighting against communism through economic expansion. While still a part of the Republican Party at the time he represented what his party would become under Eisenhower and develop into under Reagan. The isolationist branch weakened as time went on. (For more on Taft read Mr. Republican by James Patterson). Although unsuccessful as a presidential candidate he was an excellent governor and had the support of the people there. He kept excess funds from the World War II years and used them to develop transportation and help to alleviate crisis following the war.The final phase of Dewey's life was to serve as the savior of the Republican Party and the organizer of Eisenhower's campaign and election. In order to stop Taft and promote the new internationalist policies that Eisenhower elected himself with. It was a pro Korean strategy and an activist strategy across the world to check Russian expansion. While Dewey did not ever want to admit he had anything in common with Truman he did develop many of the same viewpoints but took them further with Eisenhower. Dewey became essentially the chairman of the Republican National Committee and served as the platform and ideals manager of the time.Overall if you are going to pick up a book on Dewey this is the perfect one. It is also great for those who want to understand the post world war II world through American politics. Highly recommended for those who want to understand how America and the Republican Party developed.

Peter Hopkirk's third installment of the Great game is as masterful as the first two. Lenin's drive to take over the central Asian territories and hold the oil there inspires a true terror of what the great game had evolved into. From continuing intrigued in Afghanistan to the development of Iran as a major actor in the region come directly from this time period. The great game is one of the most interesting events in history and no one tells it better than Hopkirk. You will not believe that this book is true by the time you are done. It is utterly amazing what people will do for their countries when they are called upon to serve. The adventures of the great game should be read by everyone.

The end of slavery in the French Caribbean is a story that has many facets. This book looks at one of the smaller islands (Guadalupe) and tracks its progress as it tries to free itself from the grips of slavery. Dubios tells a very good story and it is well written. The book focuses on Guadalupe but also gives a sense of what is happening in the entire British and French Caribbean. Dubios in his other books really provides a complete picture of what is occurring in the Caribbean and they are all recommended.

James Patterson adds an excellent addition to the Pivotal moments in American history series with Brown v. Board of Education. This book explores the results of Brown and how it shaped civil rights in the post Brown era. While of course focusing primarily on schools, Patterson also takes a look at how Brown emboldened groups like the NAACP, caused the rise of the more militant civil rights group by the failure to implement Brown and shows how Brown changed the views of those who went through it. The book does not just end with Brown II but goes on to look at the busing cases and the efforts of several legislatures to implement plans to uphold school desegregation. It examines the tactics of extremist white southerners to keep schools segregated and posits some interesting ideas about how Brown changed urbanization and may (at least in the south) have encouraged a second wave of white migration to the suburbs. Overall though it is a thorough analysis of the post actions that the Brown decision derived.My one complaint about this book and the reason for the four stars is that it says very little about the actual arguments of the case. While providing a background of the key players in the case there is little information about the oral and written arguments presented to the Supreme Court. That being said given that the series tries to give the most amount of information in the shortest number of pages possible I would bump it to 4.5 stars.

This book provides an interesting account of the republican convention of 1940 and the effects it had on the country. The main contest in 1940 for the republicans was between Dewey, Robert Taft and Wendell Willkie who was a democrat turned republican in the final hours to seize the nomination. Dewey to an extent an Taft to an extreme represented the isolationist part of the republican party. This book takes the reader through the convention and the twists and turns that led to the nomination of Wilkie over Taft. This book provides a scattered analysis at times of the events that followed the Philadelphia convention. This is a great update to those people who have not heard of Wilkie and these events. The book provides a very good political analysis of the time and for those interested in convention history it does tell and interesting story. I wish there had been more related to how the votes switched but at times the book jumped around and skipped over details. Overall a solid book and a great addition to the historical political landscape of America.

The Invention of the Creek Nation by Steven Hahn is an excellent look into what has traditionally been defined as the Creek Confederacy. Hahn takes issue with this gross misnomer and tries to sort out to the extent that the Creek nation as defined by the British ever existed. It is a superb look at the internal politics and international relations of the time through the eyes of colonial records of the three European powers. The end result of this investigations shows a fractured political unit comprised of many tribes. At best there can be seen two competing states of the Upper Creek and Lower Creek however their often existed many more. Hahn summarizes much of the recent literature making this an excellent overview for those who wish to learn about the Creek. The book does an excellent job of showing the Creek perspective on politics and showing how Creek leaders tried to keep a neutralist stance in war. Overall an excellent book on this tribe and one that will be immensely valuable for not only those looking at Native American history but colonial history.

This is an excellent book that covers the development of Penicillin during world war II and the interwar years. Dr. Fleming was the first to discover the penicillin properties but never really was able to develop it. He would wind up with much of the credit and the Nobel Prize but the real work went to Dr. Florey and his research lab at oxford. They took the penicillin broth and turned it into the injections and powders that saved countless lives during World War II. It was American production that as the other big winner in the Penicillin story as they were able to produce over a billion mold spores that saved forty thousand lives in a short period of time. Penicillin was tirelessly publicized after production, and was a credit to Florey's efforts. This is a well written insightful analysis that shows how the drug was developed and the wonders of World War II production. It is a great addition to the history of medicine and a very quick read. Highly recommend.

Professor Lieven does an interesting look at how Chechnya has impacted Russia in his look at the war of 1994-1996. It is very well done in detail and looks at the historical and practical reasons for the Russian defeat in the war. As other reviewers have pointed out there is a bias from the author and it is not for beginners. During his time in Chechnya he has become a fan of the Chechens and it is obvious in the way that he characterizes both parties in the war. This is a very intense and widely ranging scholarly work looking at factors including military, sociology, economics, religion, politics and history related to the conflict. The author makes a very strong point related to the character of the Chechens on religion and culture and why the fight in the war as a religion older than Islam. For those who really want to dive into why the Russians struggled in this conflict and how it persists into today this is a great book to use.

Craig Symonds provides one of the more balanced views on one of the most contested generals in the Civil War. While the debate still rages about Johnston as either tactically inept or a military genius, Symonds steps around it to look at the strengths and weaknesses of the man and points more in the direction of genius than inept. Johnston fought well during the Peninsula campaign and one the first battle of Bull Run. He was the most senior military man to leave the Union to join the confederacy and Davis political choices started a rift that would plague the confederacy throughout the war. His wounding at the battle for the Peninsula removed him from command of the Army of Northern Virginia and set the stage for Robert E. Lee's ascension.Johnston in order to avoid the political debates in Richmond was sent by Davis to the west and placed in the command of the scattered armies where although the Confederates mocked and complained of his command decisions that lost Vicksburg and Murfreesboro his enemies praised his decisions to Washington that Johnston kept the war going years longer than it should have in the west. The Confederates did not have enough men to properly defend the vast territory they were trying to. Johnston would face a rearguard action from Tennessee to Georgia where he would continue to check Sherman's famous march to the Sea. He was relieved by the confederacy before the assault on Georgia and stayed without a command through the fall of Savannah. Finally as options ran out he took command of forces in North and South Carolina to check Sherman's ability to meet up with Grant. Here he was successful in slowing Sherman down and continued fighting three days after Lee surrendered making him the last confederate Army to surrender.Overall this is an excellent biography about a complex solider who was in many of the important campaigns of the civil war. This book also details his time at west point, in Mexico, and fighting Indians before moving on to the Civil war. For those interested in Civil War history this is one not to miss.

International organizations by Pease provides a basic overview of how and which organizations change world politics through a variety of theoretical lenses. The four lenses taken are realism, liberalism, Marxism and when applicable feminism. The organizations and issues vary widely and after the United Nations and European Union it breaks down more by a topical formant such as security, environment and so forth. Overall while a basic introduction it does provide a useful starting point for looking at the role international organizations play and critically viewing it through the differ theories provided. If anything more in depth look through the theoretical lenses would be valuable as the information provided on each IO is very good and perfect for an overview like this. For those starting out with international organizations and their role in the world this is a good place to start.

For enthusiasts of diplomatic history Michael Bloch produces a masterpiece that lets us see inside the Nazi regime and their struggle to deceive the world. Ribbentrop was a cowardly and self centered bureaucrat who helped justify some of the worst atrocities that were ever seen. The book is well written and is good for a beginner on an expert. It is an essential addition to any library about Nazi Germany. Bloch's contempt for Ribbentrop is apparent and you find yourself wondering how Ribbentrop ever achieved power. His ineptitude is stunning but through this look we get a look at one of the more interesting Nazi's after Hitler and Goebbels.

Nothing but Victory is the definitive account of the Army of the Tennessee and the winning of the civil war via the west. The idea that the west played a critical role in the Civil War has been around for sometime but only in the past 5 to 10 years has it become a dominant idea that the battles of the Army of Tennessee were the critical link in allowing the Union to win the civil war and destroying the confederacy. This book provides an overview of the tactics, strategies and human stories that made up this "invincible" army. Molded by General Grant it was made to be aggressive and continue fighting. They never lost a major engagement (although Vicksburg was a long campaign) and their stories would catapult Grant, Sherman and Sheridan to fame.I will echo one complaint that I have with the author that others have pointed out. There is a annoying lack of maps throughout the book and in fact there is only one at the beginning which is not very good to following the army of the Tennessee. Despite this through the book is well worth the time to investigate and while the author makes a bold claim he supports it well. For those looking to see a different side of the Civil War this is the place to start.

Carly Fiorina went from being the most powerful female CEO to out of a job over her performance at HP. The conflict of culture at HP forced her out of her job over the merger of COMPAQ. The companies were unable to find synergy and the merger was poorly executed. This is a fair account of all participants and in the end comes down with the blame on Carly trying to be too sneaky and HP being to inflexible to embrace the future and realize their computers were useless. The branding dilution argument was very interesting. Although this merger is long over this is a useful and instructive book in corporate finance.

Hard Landing by Thomas Petzinger is one of the most comprehensive overviews of the airline industry and its subsets. This book not only covers the major players and looks at the personal lives of the titans who built the industry but also the rise and fall of companies such as Pan Am, Eastern and TWA. It focuses mostly on United and American but also looks at groups like Southwest, Frontier and Barniff. From the struggles of deregulation to the price wars of the 1980's this is one of the most comprehensive overviews. What is also nice about the book is the time spent on the related industries especially the travel agents. The book looks at how travel agents structures changed after deregulation and what happened in the hotel, rental car and service industries as a result of the airlines. Finally one of the most interesting parts of the book was the development of the computerized registration systems and their effect on air travel. From yield management of what to charge per ticket to maximizing flights in the air the numbers game of the airline industry is shown in all its glory. Overall just a fascinating book to read and very well executed.

Stephen Sears provides an excellent overview of General George McClellans life and a look at all the controversy of his command. The man regarded as Little Mac or the Little Napoleon was a political general and a superb administrator. McClellan created an excellent administration that served the Army of the Potomac and the United States government throughout the civil war. He organized massive amounts of troops and material and kept them well armed and fed. He was a man of the soldiers and was widely respected by them despite not gaining their votes when he ran against Lincoln (in fact he would only get about 24 percent of the solider vote).McClellan's faults were his intelligence services and his vain nature that prevented him from reaching huge success. The other side was always presumed to be anywhere between double to seven times the size they actually were and McClellan when he had the advantage such as Antietam refused to press it and always wanted to be 100 percent sure he would win. He was highly risk adverse and for the type of war that needed to be fought he was the wrong general. McClellan also was vain and unforgiving to those above him for the smallest slight and he blamed any secretary of war and any general in Chief along with the President for constraining or limiting his decisions. Being a relatively astute politician until he ran for president Little Mac managed to cause a number of public relations problems for the Lincoln administration.Overall this is a very well written account of the general that is fair and provides great insight into the man and his command. For those who have always read bits about McClellan through battlefield accounts this is a great way to get the whole story.

Pinochet is one of the most controversial dictators in Latin America. Sponsored by the United States he would sprout a reign of torture and death throughout Chile. This book covers what occurred under Pinochet in excellent detail. It shows how modern Chile was shaped out of the horrors that were seen by this regime. It is very well written and stays on thesis throughout the whole book. If you are just getting started on studying Chile this is an excellent book to start with. It really gives you a sense of this time period without being overbearing.

Everything I know about business I learned from Monopoly is an interesting look at the strategy behind the game of Monopoly and tries to turn it into business lessons. The book succeeds with the first part and is lukewarm on the second. The writing is very choppy and the focus is not great.As far as monopoly strategy goes this book is very interesting. From statistical breakdowns on property to average time around the board to costs to get around the board the book provides an interesting array of tips and tricks. While the psychological discussion is of limited use it is still interesting to hear about and for a fun read for avid Monopoly fans they will find this part enjoyable.As far as the business strategy goes it is poorly delivered. There are little specifics given beyond the basic platitudes that so many business books fall victim to in this trite and overused terminology. For those who want lessons on business this is not the book to do it in and you will get very little out of the poor organization and extremely high level analysis.Overall just two stars. Read if you want to learn more about how to better play monopoly otherwise move on to other business books.

Romano has built one of the great food empires and keeps on creating more. He has had over 25 different restaurant concepts and has made billions. He focuses on the creative content and the principles that have created hit after hit. He also analyzes his failures and the reason for why they failed. While Fuddruckers is arguably his most successful Romano's Macaroni grill has also prospered and even though both were sold off reading about their beginning was fascinating. His newest restaurant EatZi's is a great idea that combines upscale grocery store with eating experience. It will be interesting to see if this idea takes off outside of the large cities it is being tired in but overall this book will fascinate you and leave you wanting to start a restaurant of your own.

I was very disappointed in this book. While this does represent the trend of Irish history (combing sociology, anthropology, history and literature) I was hoping for much more of a history of Ireland and an economic and political look. This is really the SOCIAL transformation of Ireland and I was disappointed that very little analysis was put on economics and their tremendous growth since the European Union. If you are looking for just the history see the Oxford History of Ireland.

Bill Clinton is a very debated about politician and Nigel Hamilton takes a great stab at his early life. This book ends in 1992 but does an excellent job talking about his childhood growing up, college years, marriage to Hillary and the turbulent times of governor. It captures the rocky relationship with Carter and the pervasiness of Bill Clinton in his early scandals. It clearly captures the relationship with Hillary and puts out some interesting theories for their marriage and why Bill Clinton feels the need to get involved with other women. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in how Bill Clinton got to the presidency.

This combined book that synthesizes several articles on the ideas of nationalism and ethnic conflict is simply horrible. Not only are the articles chosen theoretically inconsistent in many places there are also problems with examples used. The argument that air power is even considered in cases of managing immigration from conflict zones is laughable. The arguments put forth about how ethnic conflicts come about are not theoretically consistent with the norms of international relations from either the realist or the neoliberal intuitionalist perspective. I was shocked that what is regarded as one of the best books on this subject would do such a poor job in representing the complex ideas related to ethnic conflicts. While this book would be useful to spark discussion it is very poor for use in teaching. There are however two useful things that can be learned from this book. One is that historical tensions do not primarily cause ethnic conflicts and more often than not have little to do with them. The second is that partitioning of areas can work for solving ethnic conflicts if the international system is willing to agree that it is impossible to solve the conflict. I am only just starting out in this area so I cannot recommend a better book but I am sure there are ones.

William Jennings Bryan ran for president more than most sane people would ever attempt. A devout religious figure his life was filled with tragedy. While he would never be president he would make many efforts to fight for the common man and give one of the best speeches in American political history telling his listeners that he would not be crucified upon a cross of gold. My one disappointment with this book is that it only spent a chapter on the scopes Monkey trial which I think was a fascinating time in Bryan's life and deserve more attention. Overall if you are looking for a book that can take you decade through decade of the Gilded Age this is a great way to look at it. While it does not focus on the industrialization you get a much better perspective of the common Americans from this book than any other. This is a must read for anyone studying the Gilded Age

When I was assigned to read this book I was afraid it was going to be a boring biography that went nowhere. I was pleasantly surprised at how well written and interesting her life is. Evita shaped the culture of Argentina and brought the country on the world stage. She was laughed at in the capitals of Europe on the Rainbow tour and her society was riddled with corruption. Her life is well shown here and it provides an excellent look into the culture of the country. Fraser's translation is very well done and Navarro's work is the definition of academic scholarship. For those who want to learn about Evita there is no better book.

This book offers an excellent overview of East Asian history. It is not a through account of every event that happened in the time period but it provides a great framework for further study. After going through this book the reader can identify parts of Asian history, from the BC era in China to the reconstruction of Asia after World War II, for further in-depth study. It is easy to read although there is a large amount of information packed into a very small amount of pages so while easy it is not a light read by any means. Overall it is a great textbook on East Asian history and wonderful for those who are just getting started in that area.

Urban history is a very tough subject to find good books on but Fogelson is among the best. His book on how the Downtown came about is excellent. Well written and focusing on a diverse array of downtowns he explores how the department store and subways developed. He talks about the collapse of the "El's" and urban renewal destroyed the downtown. If you have any interest in urban history this is a great book for experts and novices alike. Fogelson writes very clearly and does a wonderful job explaining his topic. Easily five stars.

This is one of the best books I have read on the Napoleonic era. Although I believe the first world war to be the Seven Years war Fergosi compelling argues how the Napoleonic wars engulfed the world. From the Caribbean to Europe, to America to Australia the forces of Europe clashed and brought destruction across the globe to stop the man from Corsica. The struggle for empire between the British and the French is very clearly seen and well analyzed. It is very easy to read and whether you are a beginner or an avid expert of Napoleon this is an excellent book. This is an essential addition to any Napoleonic library. Highly recommend as one of the two great books I have read on Napoleon (out of some 70 books).

This book offered an excellent look at life in colonial America through the American Revolution. Benjamin Franklin was apart of two worlds for most of his life and bridged the gap in interesting ways. Whether it was the upper class of London or the print shops of the United States there were many looks at social situations in this time period. Franklin is extolled for his brilliance as an inventor and for his ingenuity in politics. His description as the wise sage of the continental congress provides a different perspective that is hard to get elsewhere. Overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking at colonial America or the revolutionarily period. While it does not deal with the war it offers an excellent look at the peace process and other aspects that are hard to find in many books on the revolution.

This is an excellent book about how Napoleon and those around him rose to power. It is very in depth and took awhile to read but it was well worth it. I highly recommend it to those who want to understand the Brumaire coup. Woolworth does an excellent job of taking the complex process and weaving together a very rich text that has interesting conclusions about the coup. If you are looking for a book that combines internal French politics with the society at the time this will give you a good sense of France. Highly recommended for those studying Napoleon and truly essential for any Napoleonic library.

This is an older overview of how the British Empire and India are intertwined and what those two countries contributed towards eachothers identity. The first couple of chapters are very theoretical and philosophical discussions on empire and the role of development in each state. The second half of the book looks at the rise of the 1857 Mutiny, the events that occurred during and the aftermath that follows. While some of the conclusions of the book have been modified by recent scholarship there is still a lot to gleam from this book and it is one of the great classical studies in the history of Empire. For those looking to understand the relationship between Britain and India this is still a great place to start.

Stephen Ambrose provides an excellent narrative on the invasion of D-Day. The book is divided into three sections with the first two about 100 pages each and the last taking up the rest of the book. The first section is an introduction to the major players focusing mostly on Eisenhower, Montgomery, and Rommel. The next section focuses on the build up of forces and the special operations of the invasion. Finally the last section is an account of the four various beaches (focusing on Omaha and Utah) and the trials and tribulations these troops faced. It is a masterful storytelling and while not recounting every detail it relies on interviews to piece together what happened that day. The reader is given an account of what happened from the view of American soldiers. For those who level that this book is pro-American, I encourage them to take a look at the sources and realize that is what the offer is working with. He did not interview Germans, British or French but American troops. For those who want a historical account of troop movements they should buy a different book. This is an account of personal stories and one that is complied very well.

If you are interested in the Trader Joe's experience or retail grocery in general this is the only book out there.

Whenever you pick up an Oxford history of the United States you expect an attention to detail and excellent prose. This book does not disappoint. It covers the salient history during the time period and utilizes the top scholarship to do so. From urban history to social movements in the fifties and sixties this book covers everything. There is some repeating but that is to be expected when writing a book of this size. The coverage on the shifts in political viewpoints and the hope of the nation makes for fascinating reading. Patterson makes an interesting point with his ideas of the United States having Grand Expectations. His conclusions that go through what expectations fell short and what were filled puts the entire time period in a different and interesting perspective. This is a must read for any one interested in post world war 2 history or trying to understand how America arrived at where it is today.

The life of Mussolini was one that was filled with tragedy for the state of Italy. Mussolini is not lionized by Dennis Mack Smith but instead taken apart for the inadequacies in his rule during the World War 2 era. Mussolini never really had control of the situation in Italy and was most of the time a confused dictator. He believe his strength to be far greater than it was and considered Italy a great power in the world. He was quickly becoming a pawn of Hitler and his indecisiveness led Italy down a path of destruction. There is little to be proud of given the evidence posted in this book and it brings to light a perspective that should be analyzed. The book is very well written and is not bogged down in heavy detail. It highlights the salient points and provides a context for life in Italy under Mussolini. While Mussolini's thugs did terrorize the populace form time to time the country really ran as it did in the pre-fascist days. The security forces were police state at times but nominally Mussolini, especially as the war went on, quickly fell out of favor with the people. He lost his touch with reality and while no one wanted to challenge his perceptions it did not matter as Italy was driven back again and again over the course of the war. This is a must read for those who want to understand how Italy fit into world war 2 beyond simply a military context.

This book by Richard Lamb is an interesting account of how Mussolini engaged World War II and the performance of Il Duce in world politics. It is a fairly positive view of the Duce's role in world politics and the author is far more critical of the British and French governments (particularly Anthony Eden). There are many interesting arguments here about the Italian diplomatic strategy and those interested in World War II diplomacy will do well not to miss this book. The author has researched from a wide array of sources and compiled them in a unique fashion. This is not just an account of the war but a thorough diplomatic analysis that is very hard to come by. It does an excellent job of combing multiple countries sources to weave a story where they are complimentary. For those who really want to delve into World War II they will find a lot here that can be enjoyed. It is well written and goes into an appropriate level of detail for those familiar with the subject. If this is your first book on diplomacy in World War II you may want to start with a more traditional biography of Mussolini such as Dennis Mack Smith's (which provides an interesting contrast with this book). While this book represents one viewpoint of scholarship it is one that deserves consideration and although not all the conclusions can be taken at face value there is a lot that can be gleamed from this book.

Boss Tweed is another excellent book on gilded age history by Kenneth Ackerman. This time Ackerman provides a look at one of the most corrupt politicians (in terms of dollars stolen) in American history and looks at how he rose to power and what kept him there. Mostly Boss Tweed is shone for what he was, a ward boss who excelled at corruption and getting his constituents what they want. Even at the time of his trail he was not universally condemned and many argued unjustly imprisoned given his conviction of misdemeanor. It was not until he fled the authorities and his later confession that his reputation began to tarnish. Even then we see Boss Tweed as one of the most infamous figures in Gilded Age history for his detailed political schemes, power triangles, and reckless profiteering from the public till that make him the most intriguing " boss" in political history.This book also take time to introduce the men who tried to bring down William Tweed and the flaws that they brought as well. From New York Times editor to the famous Thomas Nast whose cartoons would help elect a president and destroy Boss Tweed all are explored throughout the book. There are also several reproductions of the various cartoons scattered throughout to gain a look at the effectiveness of each. The start of the "watchdog" press is born in this time and while it would take many years of muckraking to refine it the beginnings are seen here.Overall it is a great book showing the times and the start of many dominant trends in America from investigative journalism, the political boss system, and the shift from local government towards federal for works projects. It is written very well and reads like a fiction story that is easy to follow and a real page turner. Highly recommended for anyone with a general interest in history or politics but for gilded age fans it is a special read!

The Oxford History of the United States always does an excellent job of addressing any topic in American history but this book is truly one of the hallmarks. There are few books that cover the depression in the same rich and detailed way that Kennedy does. He manages to capture the people, the government and the social movements perfectly and gives a great sense for what happened to the American people during this time period. The war analysis is the right blend of politics and tactics that allows for a view of what is happening at the home front and abroad. He focuses on Europe and the Pacific giving good examples of how they impacted the united states and "Freed us from fear" allowing us to face a new world. This book is done in wonderful and rich prose that makes it easy to read. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a summary of this time period.

Walter Issacson provides a readable and thorough account of Einstien's life. From his great scientific discoveries described in layman's terms (I have never taken a physics class in my life and easily understood the descriptions) to his personal life and what fame did to transform the way he lived. The details are well laid out and prove once again Issacson's mastery of biography. The theories that Issacson lay out are well thought out and provide insight into how Einstein came up with his ideas and conducted his famed thought experiments as the patent officer in Switzerland. Einstein while undoubtedly brilliant was enthralled by being an underdog and by academia not accepting him initially he was able to look past their old ways and conceive something new. The spare time at the patent office allowed him to conduct these experiments and provide theories that would shake theoretical physics to its core. Overall it is highly readable and well worth the time for those looking for a non traditional history book or those in physics who want to learn more about the man behind the relativity.

This is an excellent military history of the African invasion. If you are looking for a book that will tell you about the importance of the invasion and how it influenced the war this is not for you. This is strictly a military account and while it is well done it offers little else. The prose is very clear and conventional like most military histories. Overall it is a great analysis of the war and provides an essential report on what happened in Africa.

Edward Crapol provides a short but insightful book into the effect James Blaine had on the development of "American Empire" in the Gilded Age. From the house to his eventual triumphs as secretary of state in several administrations James Blaine "the man from Maine" developed many of the key ideas that would allow William McKinnley to be successful in annexing Hawaii, expanding American influence and the expansion of American trade through things like the open door policy. These were all things Blaine pushed for but lacked the ability to get through due to changes in administrations during his time. His unsuccessful runs for the presidency were usually matched by his ability to wind up as secretary of state where he did far more good than he would have otherwise done. He was an able administrator with thinking beyond his time that would transcend into the future according to Crapol. The biggest complaint about this book is that it does not go into enough detail and you find yourself wondering how some of the conclusions are reached since we don't hear about the debates in the senate or more about the proposed revolutions in Hawaii. It still provides an excellent look at what happened just without the details of why it happened. Overall it is at 4 stars due to the lack of detail.

David Detzer brings an excellent finale to his three book series on the start of the civil war. While not a revealing story of little known events like the first two he provides a different take on the battle of Bull Run. Details of the battle are given within this book but it is not your typical civil war book and the lack of maps is more intentional since it really is about the political fallout and what the military on both sides learned from their encounter. From the defeat of the Union and the retreat to Washington and the rising of Civil War legends like "Stonewall" there is a little something about every side in this book. There is not an inherent bias and what is nice is the coverage of peripheral armies such as those stationed in the Shenandoah, Western Virginia and Harpers Ferry showing their impact on the battle. It is a complete overview and for those who are starting out on civil war history it is a great first book to read. For the more advanced reader of civil war history there is also plenty to gleam since the coverage goes into many areas not looked at as comprehensively by other books. Very highly recommend to those interested in this era of US History.

Wagons West by Frank McLynn is another great book by an author who has had a string of them. This book covers the era between the end of the fur traders and the start of the gold rush and tells the stories of the migrants who crossed deserts and mountains often without accurate maps or proper supplies to reach the land of milk and honey in California and Oregon. While the book focuses on "the Oregon Trail" it also cover the Santa Fe Trail and other trails into California. The Oregon Trail is a series of different trials most commonly thought of as leaving from Independence Missouri but could also leave via Boise or Kansas City to name a few with an end destination of Oregon or northern California. The book covers the notable wagons of the Donner's and their ill fated venture ending in displays on cannibalism and depredation towards women and children. It also covers the resettlement of the Mormons and how they changed life on the trails by settling in Salt Lake City. It is (like his other books) very detail oriented and there is a lot to take in during the short amount of pages. As some others have noted this is not a quick read but well worth the time and packed full of very strong information about the overland trails and the people who rode them. For those who have a knowledge about how the US changed during these years and want to get the details of that change this is a perfect book to read.

This travel guide combines the right amount of Theme parks with classic Orlando. The top 10 attractions covered are primarily theme parks but then when region by region is broken down you can really see the various areas to explore in Orlando. From downtown Orlando to Cape Canaveral there are lots of fun and cheap things that can be done outside of Disney and Universal. This is a great start to planning any trip. If you are just going for the theme parks than I would use a different book but if you want to see it all this is the one to get.

How did the Big Bell collapse? This book gives you the answer. From the government break up of the monopoly to the sheer ineptitude of its managers this book shows what happened to AT&T. With a solid business model and great strategic options this company was destroyed through egos and debt. It is very well written and gives an excellent glimpse at where telecom and multimedia are heading. Everyday reaffirms the truth that these two will have to merge. This book shows why that is and even though AT&T was unable to pull that off the sense of the company was dead on. Read on if you want to learn not how to run your corporation.

This book is an excellent summation of the Benjamin Harrison presidency and covers the tumultuous changes that were occurring in the 1890's. Harrison was the last of the civil war presidents to achieve the presidency and led with a military like clarity that was reminiscent of Grant. Harrison broke the rules of Gilded Age politicians by appointing a cabinet of unknowns and not answering to party machines and stalwarts alike. He was the true commander in chief managing the army at a time during the end of the Indian Wars and Wounded Knee as well as beginning the building of a navy that would allow McKinley to begin an American "empire". Benjamin Harrison also served as his own secretary of state due to the illness of Blaine allowing Harrison unprecedented control that Gilded Age presidents did not typically have. Overall this book hones in on these topics and more following the Harrison presidency and how it impacted America. It is an excellent and brief summation of an important Gilded Age president and well worth the read.

Big Change at Best Buy looks at the implementation of the Standard Operating Platform (SOP) that changed the way Best Buy stores were managed, operated, and supplied. It looks at Best Buys implementation of this program as they experienced hyper growth opening more than 40 stores per year for several years. Ensuring a consistent product and retail experienced when dealing with a store that includes this many departments is nothing short of a nightmare and this book explains how it is done well. It includes what Best Buy did, why it worked and what others can do for a similar experience. Focusing on humans (employees) through head, hearts and hands it takes a step by step approach to how managers can implement change and preserve employee morale and knowledge base.If there is one problem with the book (and the reason I give it four instead of five stars) it is that the SOP is never really described in detail so you do not get a look at what is changing at Best Buy. You understand that a major shift in operational, procedural, supply chain, and employee mindset is occurring but you do not get the full picture as to what that change is.Overall if you are looking to introduce a major change to a company (big or small) this is a great way to look at how to implement. Recommended for MBA students as well looking into management of people as a possible best practices approach.

David Detzer provides an excellent look at the earliest days of the Civil War and the events that led to its outbreak in his three book series. Book one Allegiance looks at the motives and the occurrences that put the nation into Civil War. While war may have seemed inevitable in retrospect, for the days leading up to Fort Sumter it was not a forgone conclusion. Detzer follows not only Sumter but the two other forts in Charleston harbor that put the nation into war. While inactive government on both sides prolonged the conflict both sides ineptitude would lead to war. Bravery and quick thinking on the union side would stave off disaster while the confederacies lack of resources bought time that lead to the hope of the Union.To echo the other reviewers I have to point out that this is one of the better written history books out there. It flows quickly and with an interesting story that is characteristic of Detzer's books and brings the reader in quickly wanting to know what happens next. It is a fascinating way to read history and it gives not only a military and political perspective but takes you into the personal lives of the people who defended and attacked Fort Sumter. For those who want to see what was occurring in the days before the civil war this is the best book to do it.

This is the classical view of how the French revolution started. It has its merits to read although I feel the revisionist history has more of it correct. In order to accept this book you have to be willing to take a Marxist tone with the book. If you accept that the bourgeois was the reason for the French revolution this book does an excellent job of putting early events of the revolution in context. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the Declaration of Rights on the Man and Citizen have nice chapters as well as the Bastille. This is one of the best accounts of the Bastille that I have read. It is easy to read and well the Marxist overtone at times is distracting is a good starting point for learning about the French Revolution.

There have been many great books written on the confederates commerce raiding and its impact on the civil war. Tom Chaffin adds another excellent book to this growing collection of literature. Tracking the CSS Shenandoah as it was surreptitiously bought, armed at a secluded island and put to see with the intent to raid whaling ships in the artic. The ship was a last ditch effort in the dying days of the confederacy as Richmond was being surrounded to strike back at the Yankees. Overall they were very successful as they captured ships along their trip to Australia where they refitted before heading to the Artic. One of the things this book covers better than some of the other was the legal and diplomatic battles waged by Union European Counsels against their shadowy Confederate counterparts as they tried to prevent these ships form going to sea or leaving a neutral port. The Shenandoah continued fighting after the war was over and continued its plundering cruise until confirming that the South had surrendered. They became one of the most hunted ships in the history of the world and managed to elude capture until sailing back into Great Britain where they surrendered to the British. Overall just an intriguing story and one that will hold the readers attention in this little covered topic of confederate sea raiders.

Ackerman writes another accessible, informative and engaging history of the Gilded Age in his book on the Gold Ring. At a time when government regulation was nonexistent and men with deep pockets could reign financial terror; the unthinkable happened and greed ran the country. This book details from start to finish how the key players came to know eachother and plan the gold ring under Jay Gould's masterful strategy. It is a story of daring wits, bribery at the highest levels and pure showmanship that all two men to manipulate the price of gold. Utilizing resources from newspapers, to letters to congressional hearings conducted by James Garfield the reader is given a clear picture of what happened during the gold ring.I do second what other reviewers have said that this book is full of typos that make it hard to read at times but it does not draw away from the content. Overall this is the book to read if you want to understand further the gold ring and its implications in the financial world.

The evolution of American medicine is a fascinating story and it is told very well. The analysis is excellent and this really provides a great perspective about how the US got to the corporate system we are now on. I wish there would be an update that would take us from 1980-2000. The debate over how socialized medicine did not take root is very interesting and well done in the book. If you are getting started or an expert this book has something for everyone. Highly recommend for those who are trying to understand how doctors and hospitals developed in America.

This is one of the best displays of political history in a long time. The tactics of the Federalists and the Jeffersonian are well presented here in the election that showed American democracy was a reality. The author does a wonderful job of weaving together the complex issues that were involved. For those who feel today's campaigns are filled with personal attacks they have nothing on 1800. The book is very well written and is an excellent addition to a great series. This book serves as a summary for the lives of Adams and Jefferson as well as looking at the development of political parties in the United States. There is some consideration thrown on to Hamilton although a little more would have solidified the arguments. Despite that this is a great book to start with or if you are an expert in this area it is one you will enjoy.

This book serves as a guide for the men who fought in Central America from the 1880's through the great depression. It recounts their exploits but really does not get into their motives. Simply calling them soldiers of fortune does not make sense when their exploits are explored in detail. I think this book has value as a starting guide except for the fact that it requires a lot of knowledge on the history to begin with. The author's attempts at trying to determine which groups were responsible for which raids leave a large scholarly gap to be filled. This books value is limited and really should only be used as a quick review of what happened.

Rock n roll may seem like an odd choice for a pivotal moment in American history but altschuler supports his thesis very well and by the end I was convinced. This book is an overview of the business, politics, race relations, and generational relations stemming from rock and roll. It looks at rocks early years through the "day the music died". If you are looking for a book that will serve as an introduction to the rock n roll movement then look no further. I was very impressed with the information presented and as someone who knew nothing about the history of rock when I started I was pleased with how much I learned. It leaves a few places hanging such as what happens to Elvis after he joins the army but mostly it covers everything in the right amount of detail. Highly recommend.

This book is another member of the Pivotal Moments in American History series and it lives up to its name. Washington's crossing of the Delaware was a major turning point in the revolution and brought about a stunning change in the fortunes of the war. The British were forced to recognize that the war was far from over and settle in for a protracted conflict. The prose of this book is excellent and Fischer goes into voluminous detail on everything surrounding the crossing. The book also summarizes the year 1776 so that the picture leading up to the crossing is very clear and the significance is seen. Overall this is a highly recommended read and an excellent addition to the pivotal moments in American history series.

The Perfect Thing covers the story of the Ipod as it was developed and released to the public. It looks not only at the business and the technology but also the sociological effects of the Ipod and what it did to shape culture in the United States. It is a very well written book that the reader can move through easily. I agree with the other reviews that this is a light and fun read with not a ton of substance but just enough to learn something new if you are not familiar with how the Ipod was developed. Overall the book was entertaining and worth the time to read if you want to learn more about how the Ipod has shaped culture in the United States.

Sherman, Myers and Deeds have the best book on Mexican history that can be found. It covers all aspects from the social and cultural to the military and political. It is very well written with plenty of pictures so you can visualize what happened at each point. The analysis is truly top notch and one of the great assets of this book is the wonderful suggested reading at the end of each chapter. It really allows you to learn all about Mexico and then go back and read further on the parts you find the most interesting. This is an essential book for any latin American history library and one that will live on throughout the ages. It is updated regularly although any edition is a great start to learning about Mexico. Whether you are an expert or a beginner you will find this book useful.

This book edited by Rubenstein and Smolanksy provides a very interesting look at how the transcacuses and central Asian republics are being caught in a rivalry between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Turkey's security considerations have often been at odds with Russia and although there have been periods of cooperation the book shows the ways in which this tension has revealed itself. It astutely points out that Tehran and Moscow have reentered their imperial days and are competing for influence in the region. With that being said it is not a military conflict and war between the two is unlikely. They are going to compete in the style of the great game where political maneuvering is far more important.The central Asian region represents an outlet for Iranian oil at a time when Iran is isolated in the world. Ukraine in particular was thought to be a possible gold mine that knowledge, food and other technical help could be obtained. Both Turkey and Russia have worked to prevent a union between these two and have largely been successful. Places like Armenia and Turkmenistan align themselves closer to Iran due to cultural ties but neither country has been a great boon to Iran who is still looking further to extend its influence. For so long Iran served as a buffer state for the west and Soviet Union that it has not yet defined its own role in the region.The relationship between Turkey and Iran is also still in flux and each has been defined by its position since World War 1. Turkey choose to follow the course of a state that wanted to join the status quo and Iran has remained aloof until the 1979 revolution where it choose a course of radicalism. These factors have helped to shape a region where the two countries are often at odds with one another.The region today is largely defined by its relationship to Russia and this book helps to show that Iran and Turkey both overestimated the amount of influence they were going to posses in the region. Their aid packages were low and with low money come less influence. Russia has a historical tie to the region and this tie has yet to be overcome. Turkey and Iran do have the capability to play a larger role and Russia must continue to be careful in order to hold on to the gains it has made. This book while a little dated (published in 1995) does an excellent job of showing how the region was shaping up. While more information should be obtained t0 understand the region today this is an excellent starting point. For more updates on the region see Rajan Menon's book on Central Asian oil.

The House provides an accessible summary of the political history of the United States through the lens of the House of Representatives. It covers the key controversies of Presidential power, state vs. federal and legislative battles between parties. It does an excellent job of looking at how the role of the Speaker has changed and focusing on the two most powerful speakers Henry Clay and Sam Rayburn. It is very easy to read and quick for those with a good background in US history who can focus on the complexities of the house. I agree with many of the other reviewers that for those who have a major interest in US history will find this lacking in substance as the author could have gone into much greater detail. Overall though it provides a decent summary and can be used as a jumping point for finding what other areas in US political history one wishes to read further into.

This book is interesting for academics only. It is a good discussion as to where civil war literature needs to go in the future. It is a reflection on why the southern perspective in the war has not been undertaken and it outlines Ayers efforts to develop this history further. The title DOES NOT REFELCT what is in the book. Overall though for academics of the civil war this really is a must read.

Hassig has provided us with an excellent account of how the Aztecs conducted warfare before the Spanish arrived and including the fight with them. The tactics are indicative of a modern army and this is a must read if you are studying the Aztec Empire. The book is very well done and offers a unique perspective on warfare. It is hard to find good information about ancient societies warfare but the Aztecs left good records. Their political systems are also scrutinized here. Highly recommend.

The Nordstrom way gives an inside perspective of how the service at Nordstrom's really is run. It gives the perspective of desperation and attention to customers. By putting is employees livelihoods on commissions they are forced to deliver a superior product. The purchases and the sales clerks work closely together to form a bond that gives the company its edge. Overall this is an excellent book and very well done. It is written very well and can be read very quickly.

This book begins where Path to Power left off. It does give a quick recap so you can pick up here if you did not want to read the first one (although I recommend reading it as it is spectacular). The lies of Johnson's military service are almost too much to believe. His desire to retain elected office and achieve his goals remain unmatched as ever before. This book yet again shows how Johnson would lie and cheat his way to power. The Texas politics are truly among the most disturbing that you can see anywhere. The corruption is rampant and with an election where Johnson wins by only 87 votes the corruption was rampant. The race for the senate seat against governor Coke Stevenson who was one of the more principled Texas politicians is famous in Texas history. This book is wonderful at recounting that event as well as giving further insight into Johnson. Caro's writing is superb and the desire to find out what happens next is unmatched in other biographies. This is a must read for anyone interested in political history, biographies, or politics.

The newer research on the Civil War suggests that it was won in the west and that the action in the east is not what caused the end of the war. Vicksburg was the crucial campaign in the west and while this book can get bogged down in details it does a very good job of providing information. The challenge of taking this city on a hill and the importance of the navy are all well explained here. A look at what happened to the south as the war progressed is not readily apparent but if read in between the lines it is easy to see what happened. The analysis about the importance of opening up the Mississippi to union forces is very good and brings new light on a subject that needs a lot more exploring and debate.

This book does an excellent job of outlining the current historiography of the Nazi regime. It is really only meant for scholars and it is fairly dense even for them. Kershaw does a masterful job of capturing each of the debates and this is really a great book if you want to write about Nazi Germany but don't know what to focus on. It is still relevant even today and does a great job of outlining the current debates that need to be addressed by historians.

Rupert Murdoch is one of the most interesting business men of our day. His growth at the Fox Network and other various news outlets has made him one of the most powerful men on the planet. Shawcross does an excellent biography telling about his life in Australia up through his dominant position in America today. It covers the start of the fourth network as well as the New York post and battles with government regulators. It stops before the Fox News Channel really gets going but this still remains the best biography on Murdoch that has been done to date.

The history of fast food and how it developed are among the best stories in business. Ray Kroc adds his perspective in this biography. This is actually a very fair biography and Kroc tells the story from his perspective. The discovery of McDonald's from his milkshake business and the ineptitude of his friends in diluting the brand name are among the high points of the early years. He takes us pretty far into the history and the only thing you want to hear more about are the aboard prospects. While I prefer behind the arches this book is an excellent start to a great story.

While there are many books on the Cold war this one has to be the best. It is the only book I have read that uses voluminous research from not only the American side but the Russian side as well. If you are looking for that fair and balanced viewpoint than this is the place to start. Walker writes very well and covers the relevant aspects of the war including d&eacute;tente. It focuses mostly on the power that the two exhibit and sticks with diplomatic history. There is some discussion of third world (with the exception of Cuba, Vietnam and Egypt) otherwise it really focuses on Europe. Nonetheless it deserves its five stars and is the only book I ever recommend when someone wants to read about the cold war.

If you only read one book on the Balkans this is the one you should read. Glenny takes us through the rise of the Balkans following their separation from the Ottoman Empire through the present day break up of Yugoslavia. The fall of communism is well illustrated as is the struggle between Russia and Austria for mastery of the region. The establishment of Bulgaria as the "super power" of the Balkans by the Russians is illustrated in the comical light that it was at the time. This book does an excellent job of thoroughly covering the salient points in the region and doing so with wonderful prose. This is an incredibly troubled area and understanding that this area was created out of conflict is essential for studying the region today. This is great for an expert or a beginner. Regardless of how much you've looked at the Balkans this is a must have for any European history library.

Ray Moseley does an excellent job in bringing to light the final days of Italy under Mussolini. The Republic of Salo which is formed after the Nazi's free Mussolini from prison is a vague attempt to showcase that Italian people are still in control in Italy. As Moseley shows the Republic had no real power and Mussolini was consulted on almost nothing leaving the German military to run the state. The book jumps around on many topics and discusses Mussolini's stances on a variety of issues from anti-semitism to law and order in the fascist decrees he issued during this republic. The final fall of Mussolini and his capture amongst the mountains of lake Como are very well done and then the final part focuses on various myths related to Mussolini. While the book bounces around it is a great contribution to the last 600 days (594 to be exact) of Mussolini's empire and the tragic fall of Italy's most powerful leader.

The Erie Canal was a major factor in shaping the economic development of this country. It would open up the west and allow the untapped resources of America to be utilized. This book covers the political history and development of the canal showing how it was built and what happened to those who fought for it. It is very well written but could have been made clearer at times. There are so many interesting people associated with the canal that it can be easy to get lost in the story. Nonetheless this is an important part of American history and something that should be told. Highly recommend for those who want to understand how America became the power it is today.

Edmund Morgan presents a very different approach to analyzing Ben Franklin's life. He does not go day by day or even year by year but instead looks at the overall legacy. While I think this is an interesting way to look at Franklin's life it is not as useful as Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson. It is still possible to learn a lot about his cultural legacy and intellectual legacy. I did learn things about Ben Franklin that I had not from other biographies because this does stick to the large picture. This book does cover the essentials as others have noted but I think it also sets a new and exciting trend for biographies. To get the place of a person in history it is worth looking at how they fit in to larger events as opposed to just their life. Morgan's writing is very engaging and this is a valuable addition to the literature on Benjamin Franklin.

The Profits of Science takes a look at how technology in America has been developed in the 20th century. It looks at our forward thinking process from the 1939 world's fair and the advent of government in research during the Manhattan Project of World War 2. The rise of the big corporation (Du Pont, RCA, AT&T) combined with the machine shop culture of the Edison's and Tesla's gave rise to the modern R&D labs. Television was developed entirely within the context of the private sector and groups like RCA attempted to create monopolies based on their scientific knowledge. Occasionally the government would step in to regulate but more often than not groups like AT&T would find ways around the antitrust suits especially during the Reagan years. The transistor was the first real development that proved wildly successful out of the Bell Labs. This work was done primarily with venture capitalists which contrasted with the government funding of old. The early work of venture capitalists was trained on the stock market and looked towards mergers and acquisitions as the model for what to invest in. The computer would be the first chance to change that strategy and look at applied science. The computer proposed a difficult problem for engineers and business men. The capabilities were doubling with each new advancement under Moore's law but the prices were falling at a rapid rate. Companies ran into the problem of making money in a market where your price is falling. The way these companies began was through generous venture capitalist support of Arthur Rock. Many of these graduates came out of Stanford and began working with companies like Intel and Hewlett Packard only to leave and start their own. This was a slightly similar pattern to the pharmaceuticals that focused on chemists initially to create drug compounds that could be sold. The pendulum is swinging back towards biologist with the latest biotechnology craze. The evolution of technology as described by Teitelman shows the machine shop entrepreneur being replaced by the well funded R&D labs of corporations. Even those would be displaced by the federal governments funding. The modern era sees a return to the entrepreneur but this time he is funded by VC's. Overall Teitelman paints a very clear picture of technological development and does it in a remarkably short amount of pages. This is a very important contribution to the history of business and technology and I highly recommend it to all who are interested in those fields.

Stanley Wolpert delivers one of the most concise yet thorough accounts of Indian history to date. He does an excellent job of looking at the development of the subcontinent from the days of BC to the modern Tamil and Pakistani conflicts afflicting the nation today. I read this book to get a background on India as a whole and was not disappointed in its quality. It goes into enough detail to understand the story of how India developed as a country with excellent references on where to get more information. Whether you are looking for a basic textbook of India or an introduction to a study for further use this is a great place to start. From a historical standpoint it is very difficult to write a great survey book but this delivers on every possible expectation for a survey. For those who have knowledge on this subject they may find this book maddeningly frustrating or subject to bias and revisionism however from a novice standpoint I do not see much evidence of that. The citations clearly point to sources where ideas come from and they can be verified through independent reading. Highly recommend for those wanting to learn more about India and how it developed as a nation.

Robert Remini provides an excellent and thorough biography of Henry Clay and his influence on the nation. From the good and the bad to the ugly all of Clay's exploits are analyzed and assessed relative to their place in history. Arguably one of the masters of political intrigue and without doubt one of the best debaters in the history of the Congress, Clay shaped the nation through his mastery of the House and the American System he fought for. His economic development programs expanded the nation's economy and paved the way for the west to develop into an integrated part of the country. Remini takes a critical eye towards whether Clay was the great compromiser or a politician looking to be elected by bringing together various electorates trying to be a hero to all. The man who would said he would rather be right than be president found that to be true. After four attempts and defeats to people he considered his intellectual inferiors he would find his way back into the spotlight founding the Whig party. Without a doubt Clay was one of the most influential politicians of his age and the claim of Remini that he was a second Washington was not far off the mark from the case provided here. Overall a very well written book that covers the formation of what could be called the United States formative years. For those who want an understanding of the early republic and antebellum periods you cannot go wrong here.

This book is meant to be a military analysis of the World War II axis however it comes off as an excellent diplomatic history. It shows that Germany has never been able to grasp the concepts of coalition warfare and its do it alone strategy was always going to be its undoing. The first part of the book looks at the history of German warfare before World War II. The analysis with regards to Operation Barbarossa is deeply flawed. The assertion that Russia was the primary target of Germany's desires is wrong. The evidence shows a greater tendency towards Britain than Russia. Also the analysis of Japan's role in the coalition is something that deserves further looking into. I think the author dismisses it too quickly.Despite those flaws this really does provide a comprehensive look at how the Axis functioned and especially the role of the minor powers like Romania and Hungary. It is very easy to see that while Germany nominally had control each of these Axis powers was able to contribute in their own way. The end of the Axis comes with the battle of Stalingrad and the demolition of the Axis forces as well as the failures in North Africa. The lack of Axis supplies was a tremendous problem and one that was not going to be overcome without early strategic victories. When these were not made the loss became inevitable. This book is a very clear military analysis and accomplishes a lot in 200 pages. Despite the few flaws mentioned I highly recommend the book.

CNN has become a dominant force in new and politics in the 21st century. The story of its founding and the battle between the author and Ted Turner is outlined here. Once you get past Schonfeld's bias there is a great story here that shows how the network grew from the ground up. The government regulators, competition and airwave rules that helped to form the network are covered in detail. This is a must read for anyone interested in the television industry.

This book frankly addresses the questions related to the Kurdish question in Turkey. It is great that it is not simply called the Kurdish problem as so many authors do. This is a unbiased source that holds the Kurds as terrorists when their actions are such and refugees when the excess of the Turkish government take hold. The analysis of how Kurds have integrated into political parties was of particular interest and there is a nice section on how religion affects Kurdish roles which I found particularly interesting. The solutions to the question are put forth in a straightforward and logical manner. The most pressing solution is that this is an ethnic problem and requires an ethnic solution resulting in a multiethnic state which Turkey wishes to resist. The authors make the point that the Kurds do not have an agenda for a separate state and most don't consider that a realistic goal anyway. Overall this is an essential book to read to understand the Kurdish question.

This is a great look at world economic history and thinking about why the world developed the way it did. It focuses on two distinct ideas1. Why did the west (Europe and the United States develop before the east)2. Why did the north develop before the southThe first question is answered very well and many factors including free trade, cultural decisions, and superior technology. The north and south question is much harder to answer and needs more economic analysis which is lakcing here.It took time for this book to grow on me but once it did I was very excited to read it and loved it by the end. I highly recommend it for those who want to get a sense of world history.

Evan Thomas delivers another excellent naval history in his work on the pacific battles of World War II. While this is a massive topic to take on in a one volume work Thomas does it well addressing the men who fought and the tactical maneuvers that determined the outcomes of the battles. Focusing on the main commanders who fought it goes really beyond four to address the majority of the major players giving a fair look at each and their contributions to the pacific theater. If anything this provides an interesting summary without going in-depth into too many battle details. While assessing many of the events that led to the US domination and the fall of the Japanese navy, the book spends most of its time recreating the battle of Letey Gulf. For those who have read widely on World War II this will probably not add much to their understanding as it is largely an overview but if you are new to the subject this is a great place to start to get the basics along with the perspectives of the soldiers.

Richard Tedlow produces a very interesting, although slanted, biography of Andy Grove. While many things have been written about Grove including several autobiographies this is one of the more thorough accounts of his life in a single volume. It covers the early years very well and puts the reader with Grove as he is fleeing Hungary from the Soviets and immigrating to America. His rise as a street smart engineer from City College to CEO of a major company is covered in detail. The semiconductor industry is one of the more fascinating industries to study and its development was dependant on the scientific research and development end of the semiconductor companies, but also the development of the personal computer research. The 800 pound gorilla in that game was none other than Big Blue IBM and when IBM selected Intel's processor the market was corned. As with Microsoft, Intel had to engage in direct consumer marketing to keep the public demanding the latest chip in IBM and competitors computers. Overall it is a great chronicle of how Intel grew as a company and what led them to predominance in the industry.The only major complaint is that this book is incredibly pro Andy Grove to the point that Grove can do no wrong. While there is little doubting that Tim Jackson's account treats Grove very harshly I feel that both books need to be read in order to have a balanced viewpoint of Grove's effect on the company as with many things the truth lies in the middle. Despite this I still recommend and find it an enjoyable way to learn about a fascinating man and company.

Jeffrey Paige is an excellent sociologist who provides an in-depth look at three countries in Central America. Honduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador are all explored throughout this book. There are occasional references to Guatemala but overall the other three are considered because their development has similarities. While they are different in the way they developed economically and socially they came form similar backgrounds. Similar governments formed in all three according to Paige and the effects of this were to drive these countries into a relationship where elites hold power. The social elites of the coffee producers provide an interesting case study to follow. They provide the driving force for dictatorships and while the Depression of 1929 gives fuel to the communist fire the elites retain a wide range of control. El Salvador is shown to be both a civil war and a terrorist problem that must be dealt with by resolution of local politics. Nicaragua is shown through the Somoza regime which grew out of the US marine intervention, dollar diplomacy and our support of the conservatives in that country. The sociological study comes across as scattered at times but in the end provides a useful analysis when considering the disparity in incomes throughout Central America. This book is not for beginners and historians should use it carefully. For those in sociology it is a very useful study filled with many primary accounts.

Joseph Page's biography of Juan Peron is masterful in the breadth and scope that it covers. It not only does an excellent job of describing Peron's life and his impact on Argentina but you can also get a sense of the surrounding times and the development of the country. He spends quite a bit of time developing the backdrop for Peron's rise and his influence on the country. Due and fair consideration is given to the role of Eva Peron and for those who are interested in more I recommend the Navarro biography. The book is very well written and is a fast read. If you are interested in the Peronist party and this time in Argentina this is a great book to start with.

This really is the only good source of information about Asad. It is essential to understanding the conflict in the Middle East and understanding how Syria got to where they are today. While it could use some updating overall the information is very good. It stays on point and if anything goes into too much detail. Syria is a mess politically and frequent assignations occur throughout the book. Keeping a list of people and crossing them off is very helpful as you read through. The book does an excellent job of putting Syria in perspective and really it is the only good Syrian history I have found.

Womack's timeless dissertation on Zapata is still the authority on one of the most interesting men of the Mexican Revolution. Zapata never wanted power for himself and fought for the peasants of Morelos. His desire for land reform is exposed here as well as his strategy and life. It is an excellent biography and presents a small facet of the revolution. If you have not read anything on the revolution this is not the book to start with. It assumes that you have a working knowledge of the revolution and does an excellent job of conveying the information of Zapata's ideals.

For those who have ever wondered how the FDA makes decisions and how those decisions effect companies this is a great starting point. Hawthorne takes an objective stance towards the FDA and shows their faults along with the positives. She tracks several instances of FDA oversight and gives their results. I think the part that tracks the companies progress through the FDA's is the most instructive. One of my fields of study was health and pharmaceutical economics and this was a great way to start learning about the FDA.

Before David Hackett Fischer wrote his Pulitzer Prize winging book Washington's Crossing he authored this historical masterpiece. Paul Revere's Ride takes readers through the early stages of the revolution at a point when conflict is all but inevitable. The book frames these early moments through Paul Revere's life but is really an overview of the people and the times that afflicted the country in the weeks and months before Lexington and Concord. Fischer breaks down the myth of the lone rider and shows the vast network that Paul Revere and others built to spy on the British and mobilize the people of New England. One of the more surprising aspects of this book for myself was the way in which General Gage approached the American colonists with a firm respect for the rule of law which given American protests at the time provide stark contradiction to many of the complaints.In addition to covering the vast network the author also gives a blow-by-blow account of the battles at Lexington and Concord doing a masterful job of showing how each side reacted. The implications of the battle are covered well and the strengths of the American colonists not only in battle tactics but experience are well illustrated. Overall this is an excellent summary of the events leading up to Lexington and Concord, recommended for those who want to gain an understanding of how the revolution began.

Thomas Hughes provides a critical look at how technology developed throughout the 20th century. The book begins in the 1870's with the inventors workshop and people like Edison gathering machinists around to develop new technologies for profit. This type of work space was based upon proprietary knowledge and combing the skills of those present. It was not a business driven venture on a product but it focused on the business of innovation. From the centers of innovation corporations began to develop their own think tanks and research and development labs. Although the book leaves out the early efforts of Du Pont it does pick up with AT&T and Bell Labs as the forbearers' of corporate research. The military became the other area for innovation as World War I and eventually 2 brought together science and research in a whole new way from the TVA to the Manhattan project. Also included in this new venture was mass production and the scientific management of Frederick Taylor that was employed at companies such as Bethlehem Steel and beyond. The book trails off in the 1970's with the countercultures efforts at rejecting Taylorism and starting into the PC revolution. This book provides an excellent synopsis of these doctrinal shifts in technological production and how they shaped America.

Jesse James has led a life that is shrouded in mystery. Stiles tries to put a perceptive that shows him as carrying on the civil war and fighting the style against the industrialized north that was popular at the time. It is an interesting biography and takes several different perspectives that are hard to find. There are few good James biographies out there and this is basically the best. For those looking for more on the outlaw group there are several about the whole gang but for those who just want one book about the robbers this is by far the best choice. It is thorough and gives enough information without being overbearing. Highly recommend for any civil war library as well.

A Great Improvisation provides a focus on the time Benjamin Franklin spent as the American envoy to France negotiating treaties with all the European powers and providing American representation in Versailles. From the intrigues of the court, to the social life of Paris, to the intricate negotiations with not only France but peace with Great Britain and commercial treaties with almost everyother power in Europe. The drawback to this book is the heavy prose that drags on with high amounts of detail that includes superfluous words without coming to a quick point. Often times the description is so much that you have to skim just to find the point of the paragraph. The book focuses quite a bit on the relationship between Franklin and many of the French he interacted with and is based on quite a bit of speculation and accounts from those hostile to Franklin. I think this is a book with a lot in it for those willing to take the time to decipher the prose and I did find many great additions to the Franklin myth and legend while also getting a rehash of some of the tried and true Franklin stories. For those who want something only on the time in France this is a great book to take a look at if you have a reference point for what was occurring back home. It is not a great book for those just starting out on this time period in US history. If you want a great primer for Franklin use Issacsson's book for a view of his whole life. Overall though worth the time if you are willing to work through the language.

The Gentleman Boss covers the turbulent times of the gilded Age through Chester Arthur's eyes. While being very sympathetic to its subject it nonetheless does a phenomenal job of showing how the political system at the time worked. The book tracks the turmoil's and tribulations of the Gilded Age political system. It looks at the formation of the Republican Party and the various factions that threatened to tear it apart. The reform of the system was conducted by its most ardent and staunch defender. Arthur's presidency was defined by trying to prove he was healthy and competent enough for the highest office in the land and although he did not receive the party nomination to continue he was successful in his term of office. While the usual Gilded Age scandals occurred overall it was a move towards the modern political spectrum and a hint of the reforms to come in the progressive era.Overall the book was very well written an enjoyable for those who enjoy a good discussion of Gilded Age politics and intrigue.

Katz provides the best biography of Pancho Villa. It is lengthy but is thorough and covers the relevant times in his life. Villa was a thug and a thief and Katz shows that well. His attacks against the government and the United States are clearly laid out and Katz analyzes the surrounding characters very well. If you are interested in the Mexican Revolution this is an essential book to have. For those looking to build up a library on Mexico history this is a must read. I loved every page of this book and have read it several times and each time I unlock a new level of knowledge about the revolution and Villa. Highly recommend.

NAM Rodger is a great British Naval historian and this is his best masterpiece to date. If you are looking for a story about the men, tactics and politics that drove the British navy at this time this is the best place. His discussion about the rise of the admiralty and the importance it gave to British power is very well done. He looks at how the British established naval hegemony focusing on two years. 1759 and 1805. These were two major battles in which the British soundly defeated the French leaving them with the command of the ocean. This book is very well written and a must read for those interested in naval history or British history.

This is a great book about an event that is little studied. The Rise of Japan and the downfall of Russia leading to revolution are both seen in this event. The Armada that was launched to punish the Japanese for their transgressions was a joke. It was barely holding together and it was destroyed by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima which established dominance in that region until the end of World War 2. The Russian defeat only spread discontent at home and showed how impotent the Tsars navy had become. This tragic defeat was but one more nail in the coffin that would lead to revolution. The book is well written and does an excellent job of explaining the significance of the battle in addition to what happened. This is a must have for anyone studying Russian or Soviet history.

Woodward does an excellent job of showing how Central America developed from the Kingdom of Guatemala into the nations it is today. His view of Central America includes Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize. Panama is considered a part of South America and left out of most discussions for that reason. South America went through a tumultuous time during its years under Spanish rule and despite the bourbon reforms it did not advance as Mexico or South America did. The terrain is unforgiving with malaria filled swamps along the coast and steep mountains at the top. This did not allow for the development of railroads in the post independence period or for much economic development beyond coffee production. This coffee production was difficult to ship as they lacked the infrastructure to send the product across the world.The dictatorships that would come about after the wars for independence found another source of revenue. The so called Banana republics would suffer many intrusions from filibusters but became stronger in the process. The dictatorships of the Somoza's and others would outlast many different groups causing all sorts of problems across Central America. This book seeks to capture this turbulent time period and put forth a question that has no easy answer. Why did Central America fragment into so many disparate pieces instead of remaining whole? This country would remain a nation divided of people who had common background under Spain but did not have unity in independence. One of the reasons for this is the tremendous competition between right and left. These two forces would hold sway over various aspects of these countries development through the end of the cold war. This is a great read for those who want to gain a sense of what Central America looks like and why it developed the way it did.

This book provides an excellent look at the relationship between Russia and Eastern Europe during the Soviet period. It provides a direct look at the late Khrushchev through 1980 period with some speculation on what will come. While it is an older book it is still a very valid analysis of what was happening between the countries. The chapters are broken down into two types with the first being a look at each country and then a macro view of the system as a whole focusing on topics. The chapters on Germany and Poland provide an interesting look at what happens to the two most important client states and their role vis a vis China in Soviet decision making. The next chapters look at Hungary and the Prague spring and there effects on the Soviet system. Finally it moves to the smaller countries and then Yugoslavia. After the countries are down it is assessed as system through the eyes of political economy, socialist theory, power politics and internal calculations. Each chapter is well done and it is a dry book but provides great information. For those looking to learn more about Soviet interaction in Eastern Europe this book cannot be beat.

Team of Rivals is the definitive account on the domestic politics of the Civil War. While extolling the virtues of Lincoln's political ability to array a diverse and disparate set of political and personal viewpoints amongst his cabinet, Goodwin displays how these combination's preserved the domestic peace throughout the war. She provides a striking human look at Lincoln and even many of his biographers do not achieve. While I do agree with the other summaries that this book does not necessarily present new information I feel it is worth noting that it synthesizes many books into one and provides a useful stopping point for those who want to quickly assess the domestic situation in the civil war.This book also provides excellent background on the key members of Lincolns cabinet including Seward (State), Chase (Treasury), Stanton and Cameron (War), and Bates (AG). These men representing the spectrum of political parties and factions at the time represented a unity that many did not think was possible. Lincoln's strategy of giving power to his political enemies allowed him to unify his detractors and proceed with a war that was contentious from the start. Overall this is an excellent addition to the scholarship on Lincoln and well worth the time to read.

The terror was a traumatic time in France and Andress book does an excellent job of showing how the terror evolved. It covers the rise of Robespierre, the trial of Danton, and even references the activities of Sade. The book is well written and is a great starting point for the terror as long as you understand the events that have occurred previously. If you have covered them before there is a very helpful timeline in the back of the book but you do need to have some prior knowledge of the revolution for it to be helpful.

Richard Rhodes provides the definitive account of the making of the Atomic Bomb. This book covers the characters, the technological dilemmas and all of the politics involved in making the atomic bomb. Starting with the various scientists and their backgrounds Rhodes takes us through the major players and their contributions towards the bomb. The book at times does get a little heavy on the physics but it is worth the detail for putting into context how the scientists came together to develop the bomb. The beginnings of the military industrial academic complex are developed and its crystallization becomes clear through people like Bush and Compton. While daunting at times given the sheer volume of the book it is worth taking your time to understand one of the greatest stories in the 20th century. This is truly the best account and a must read for those who want to understand how the 20th century and beyond was shaped by the work of the Manhattan Project.

Crucible of war provides an excellent look at what is arguably the first world wide conflict. From the United States to India this book does an excellent job of showing how France lost most of its world wide empire and the British rose to dominance. The ideas of the American Revolution are born out of this war and the stage is set for slave revolts in the Caribbean. This war is absolutely essential for anyone who wants to study British Empire or the American Revolution. This book is five stars and provides the best account that I have read yet. While others go into parts of the war this is the only comprehensive that really treats the war for what it is. A world war.

The spectacular rise of CNN has been put off by a newer story of Fox News. The Fox news phenomena are discussed here and their rise from taking Greta Van Sustran to Neil Cavuto is explained. While I think they downplay the significance of the second gulf war in really capturing ratings the author does a great job otherwise of tracking fox news rise. Whether you love them or hate them this is a fair and balanced look at how one of the most powerful news agencies today came into being.

James McPherson does it again with a great analysis of why men fought in the civil war and what made them continue fighting after that first battle. Whether it was brotherhood, pride, or religion each side brought with it various and compelling reasons for going to war. The war was a travesty that brought devastation to both sides but if you want to see inside the soldiers minds this is the only book that does it. There are few out there like it and I McPhereson is among the best. This is an essential book for any civil war library.

This is a great book for looking at the economic history of the United States. It covers mostly the four mentioned in the title but what was really fantastic and what deserves that extra star is that it covers the economic developments on the side. It looks at how our economy outpace Europe and the shift to make America that extra superpower. WE also have a look at how our ability to move west gave us an added advantage and that we did not have to resort to colonies. While we exported much we still made tremendous gains in internal improvements. He also grasp how the development of the coronation as an institution led to the rise of clerical and accounting positions creating hundreds of service jobs. This book is incredibly well written and really holds your interest. It offered the best explanation of Gould's attempt to corner the gold market I have ever read. It is very well researched and makes references to the top economic historians out there. A must read for anyone who wants to understand how the United States developed economically

Fox provides a critical link in the Enron story by focusing on a company history. This book is not really the story of Lay, Skilling and Fastow and the fall of Arthur Anderson. This is a book on how Enron the company rose to prominence and fell just as quickly. From the commoditization of energy trading to the asset light strategy that the company adopted the reader is taken on a step by step process of how the company fell. It is a careful business analysis and not a narrative so if you do not have experience reading and understanding business terminology this is probably not the book for you. This book does not delve into the stories behind the company so if you want the book that will vilify those who ran the company you will have to look elsewhere. For those who simply want a company history of Enron then this is for you.

If you want to understand how devastating the flu can be this is a great book. Another bonus is the history of John Hopkins and medical research in the United States. The flu spread quickly from an army medical camp in Kansas to infect and harm much of the world. In an age before penicillin the death rate was catastrophic and added to the death of the world war. This book reads like a mystery of how to figure out what was killing people across the world. This is among the best books on health history and the best book on the plague. It is highly recommended for anyone involved in health history or those looking for a defining moment in US history.

Eric Weitz attempts to put together a comprehensive view of the Genocides in the 20th century by looking at the twin foci of racial utopia and nationalism when conceptualizing genocide. This is a shorter book for the subject that was undertaken and given the length does an excellent job of looking at each genocide and tying them together. It starts off with the Armenian Genocide as the future blueprint for the 20th century and then moves onto Russia (under Lenin and Stalin), Nazi Germany, Khemer Rouge in Cambodia and Serbia in the 1990's. Each genocide is given a description without getting caught up in every horrid detail but still showing what was unique and common to each genocide. His main theoretical lens centers on the idea that those committing the genocide were focused on establishing a racial utopia via religion, ideological belief or gender. These races were narrowly defined and built upon the 20th century push of nationalism which is the other lens used to articulate the ways in which this racial utopia was to be achieved. For those looking for a basic overview of 20th century genocide this is a very good place to start.

Colin Cross gives an interesting look at the peak times and fall of the British empire. His overall idea is that the empire is an accident of history and was destined to fall. The reason for its fall included the spread of self determination, economic profitability outside of the empire and the flow of nationalistic ideas in the former empire. He provides an excellent look at the heyday of empire form 1914-1945 when the empire begins to crumble. The signs of stress begin from 1918 onwards and by 1940 are becoming apparent. World War II would be a catalyst that driven by Ghandi would result in the fall of the empire. The Suez crisis confirmed that the British did not have the power they once did and the empire collapsed swiftly afterward. The crown jewel of India was one of the first to fall with a new leadership emerging from the congress there. This book provides an interesting look and although it is not the most recent scholarship it still bears looking at. For those who want to see a good overview of the fall of empire this is an excellent place to start.

Dave Thomas autobiography (if you want to call it that) is a collection of lessons learned on what leads to success in everyday life. There is little in here about the building of Wendy's and some things about his personal life but it mostly recounts the stories of those he knows and what makes them successful. For those looking for a lighter read about common sense, good values, and treating people like you would want to be treated this is a great place to go but not for a lot of business information.

I really wish there would be an update as it is a little dated. Highly recommend as the number one business book.

This book attempts to make an argument that America is a "second creation" but in the course of the book does not really define what he means by this. It is an interesting recount of American technological history and was fairly well done. The book is written by a scholar in Denmark and the European perspective was the most fascinating part. The book examines the role of environmental history in addition to technology. It argues that mills, grid patterns, dams and resources, as well as an esoteric idea of human entropy. This attempt at science is very weak and does not make a favorable impression. Ruth Cowan's book provides a better example of how technology developed although this is still a good start. It is worth a read but can be trying in its theoretical stance at times.

The Mediterranean theater was an important place during World War 2. It comprised a significant amount of forces (although never as much as the east) and gave experience to those who would command operation overlord. From the shores of Tripoli to the peaks of Italy's mountains battles were waged for control of this strategic "lake". Both the Italians and the British saw the Mediterranean as a lake that they would command. Each side fought to make this a reality. The British were able to convince the United States to commit their forces here and exploit the weakness of Italy's armies and the lack of German forces. The argument for the importance of this theater is very clear and done well.There are some errors in this book pointed out by other reviewers but the scope that Porch undertakes still make this a four star book. It is well written and clearly analyzes the salient points of the war. It is hard to find a book that is as comprehensive as this one can be. There are several great books on North Africa and Italy is only recently coming into its own but few approach this level. By covering the conflict as a region you get a richer picture of the "lake" and how it was impacted by the strategies of war. This book is highly recommended for those who want to understand World War 2 and the way in which operations unfolded.

Dick Martin was a VP of communication/marketing sat AT&T and offers a unique perspective on why they collapsed. Frankly I think he is wrong and the reasons offered in End of the Line are far more on track. Martin takes his inside perspective and focuses on his department only which leaves a lot of the problems out. He tries to show the ego war between the top executives which does come out to be interesting but the long term strategic goals are not illustrated very well here. It is written decently enough but could definitely offer more information. A good follow up to End of the Line if you are really interested in AT&T otherwise I would skip it.

John Marshall: Definer of a Nation provides an interesting and thorough look at possibly the most notable chief Justice in our nation's history. From his tumultuous political career to his time on the bench Jean Edward Smith exercises great care in demystifying the enigma of John Marshall. Smith pulls together voluminous amounts of primary sources and provides over 100 pages of bibliography for those who wish further research in her search for how Marshall took the third branch of government and transformed it into what it is today. Whether you are a fan of the court or not there is little denying that Marshall's influence is fascinating to read in history and his vision for American government is unparalleled. From the notables like McCullough v. Maryland, Gibbons v. Ogden and Marbury v. Madison to his cases dealing with American Indians, nullification, and treaties you get a comprehensive overview of early American history. This book is very easy to read and covers large amounts of information in a concise manner. If you want to learn about the foundations of the Supreme Court you cannot go wrong with this one.

This book is a good overview of the diplomatic and military defeats of the Third Coalition by Napoleon. It outlines the troubles between Austria and Prussia and how the Russians failed to react in time to Napoleons drive. Napoleon's generals were simply able to outperform all of the participants involved. The prose is directed and easy to read. You do not really need any prior knowledge of Napoleon to read this book and for those who are knowledgeable in Napoleon this book may drag on a little at times. Overall though it provides good information and is a worthwhile addition to any Napoleonic library.

The Flight of the King from Paris was an event that shook the core of the revolution. Tackett is a great French Revolution historian and he does not disappoint here. The book is easy to read and stays on topic making you think about the idea of causality in the revolution. Tackett takes a great deal of time to explain how the flight of the king changed the opinion of the people in France. He does so very well and makes for a very interesting book. For those studying the revolution this is a much read about a crucial moment that changed the course of the revolution shifting it over to violence that had not been seen prior the flight of the king.

I was initially skeptical about a book on this sports drink but it turned out to be a very interesting purchase. It is amazing that one sports drink could control upwards of 85 percent of the market but Gatorade continues to deliver. From the Volkswagen advertising strategy to constant scientific improvement this is an excellent look at marketing and management. For those interested in sports marketing this is a must have for that library. The book is very well written and is the write balance of history, modern strategy and analysis to make this a book you will want to read again.

The story of how Marvel Comics ended up where it is today is one filled with legendary heroes and villains. The wise old sages such as Stan Lee and the original founders mattered little when Carl Ichan came in to do what he does best. The writing style is fantastic in this book and you get a story about corporate mergers that heralds back to Barbarians at the Gate. This story is a great read and I highly recommend it for those interested in corporate financial policy.

This books greatest strength and weakness is that it is one of the most thorough overviews on the city of Paris history that has been written yet. Unlike many it goes into wonderful detail on the early years of Paris and the build up on the Isle de cite. One of the other drawbacks is that the maps of Paris in the back are just okay but if you have a Paris travel book with good maps you will be better served for following the authors descriptions. The downside to the detail is that you can get bogged down very easily and lose the authors main point with all of the detail. The book tends to glaze over the post world war II era and I would have liked more explanation of the reconstruction efforts.Overall it was an excellent summary of Parisian history and put Paris in the context of the entire country. There are many books like this that offer the biography of the city and I would put this one in the middle of those. It is hard to have a very strong opinion of this book since it was neither amazing nor terrible. For those looking to learn some more about the history of the city or those who want another perspective on French history it is probably worth a read but for the general consumer on European history it is probably worth a pass.

Jeffry Wert provides a look at one of the fallen heroes of the confederacy in General James Longstreet. Longstreet has been accused of being the main reason for the Confederacy defeat at Gettysburg by not attacking early enough and of splintering the unity of the western army with his actions at Knoxville. Wert addresses all of these attacks in an effort to recast them towards their accusers. While at the end of the day there are many good points in this book it is not convincing enough to absolve Longstreet of his share of the blame. Recent historiography is becoming more critical of Lee and his vagueness of command but at the end of the day Longstreet did not attack and was as vague as Lee in his orders. It is true that Longstreet had tactical ability and has been lost in history despite being one of the Lee's most trusted advisors after Stonewall Jackson. This book is an excellent addition to the historiography of the civil war and while maybe not clearing Longstreet's name it does provide food for thought regarding his placement in history and his military ability. This is a book that spends most of the time on the military career and little on the personal so for those looking to learn more about the man you are probably better served elsewhere. At the end of the day give it a chance and evaluate with other sources for a good picture of what the Army of Northern Virginia was like.

Glen Bell was a man trying to make his way in the fast food industry and was having no luck until he decided to abandon the hamburger route and start making Taco's. The start of Taco Bell is riddled with California fast food lore and makes for a very interesting read. It is hard to find the birth of Mexican fast food in other books and this really is the best account that we have. It is very well written although it could have used a little less focus on the charity at the end of the book and a little more on future prospects. Again though it is the best we have and well worth reading if you are interested in the fast food industry.

This was a terrible attempt at scholarship. The book is poorly written and gives an overview with no specifics except for military encounters. This author should have focused his efforts on a military account of Taylor's life because after reading I feel I know nothing about the man. Admittedly there are severe source deficiencies when dealing with this subject but a much wider study could have been undertaken. Sadly there is not much written on Taylor and this does a poor job of adding to the scholarship.

The Coming of the Third Reich is the first of three by Richard Evans in his attempt to track the rise and fall of the Third Reich. The book starts out with an overview of German history from Bismarck to the end of World War 1 and provides a look at the factors that led to the identity of the Reich. Evans calls upon a tremendous amount of sources and summarizes them very well capturing the salient points. As always Evans is very fair in his treatment of the Nazi's and looks at their rise through the lens of a bystander. The hyperinflation in Germany is characterized very well and his point that the reparations were not beyond repayment before the financial crisis is a bold step. The rise of the Nazi party through their thugs and propaganda is tracked very well and they appear a modern political party. They spend vast amounts of money campaigning and they work the local election scene building a power base. This is characteristic of Europe and the rise is tracked with the right amount of detail. The rise of Hitler's lieutenants is also scene and there are almost mini biographies on Himler, Goring and Rohm. The rise of the SS and SA is clearly being formed however a great deal more detail to those organizations is given in the second book. The book ends with a look at how the Third Reich tried to reexamine the culture of Germany. The persecution of the jews is only one facet of this policy and the general disruption of law was the more shocking. Hitler believed that the Nazi's must obtain power legally but the Nazi's broke almost every law in the process. Violent pogroms became the norm and savage beatings are characteristic throughout the book. For those who want to begin to understand the Nazi rise to power this is an excellent book to start with. Book 2 is even better (The Third Reich in Power) and is a must read for anyone wanting to look at Germany.

This is a little known event in American history that is covered very well here. The genius of Hamilton's financial polices can be seen in the necessity of the excise tax and the aversion of the American yeomen farmer is just as apparent. These frontier rebels believed they were carrying on the revolution by leading their army against George Washington. The prose is excellent and very clear throughout the whole book. You find yourself excited to know what happens next and the book weaves a compelling story about one of the first challenges to the newly established government. This book is a must read for those who really want to understand the early days of the United States.

Trespassers on the Roof of the World tells the stories of the British, French and Russian attempts to reach the mysterious capital of Tibet (Lhasa) during the 1800's. Hopkirk gives an overview of the various people and the story of how each tried and failed to reach this hidden city. From competing rivalries among great powers, to the secretive and often hostile nature of the Tibetans to the physical barriers that surrounded Lhasa made the journey a harrowing and treacherous one to undertake. I will not go into detail of all 11 failed attempts that Hopkirk covers but he does cover each one in decent detail outlining the salient points related to their travels. One of the most shocking revolations is the harsh nature of the terrain and the trials of altitude sickness and problems of cooking as one was on the trail. The stories are amazing in their own way as a record of the determination to reach this Forbidden City. It would take a British expedition under a famed great game player to reach the city and demystify the squalor of Lhasa for the world to see. Hopkirk covers some of the early attempts to climb Everest as well throughout this book but it focuses mostly on the race for Lhasa. Overall it is very well written and a quick read.

It is very difficult to write a one volume biography of Eisenhower but this comes as close as one can get to being a thorough and accurate account of his life. The biography is a fair treatment of Eisenhower and looks at many of the myths that have come up about his life and dispels them. Starting with his early years and time growing up in Abeline to the days in the white house the reader can clearly see the evolution of Eisenhower. It covers not only his personal evolution but really looks at the situations he was in and addresses how he changed the situation of the army and the structures of command in Europe. Perret is a specialist in the military biography and his treatment of Eisenhowers war years is among the most thorough ever written on the man. The book is plainly written and easy to read making it a fast 600 pages that leave the reader well informed and with the right amount of information on their subject. If you are really looking for the complete history of Eisenhower though you should consider some of the multivolume works that have been done but for a thorough one volume account this cannot be beat and will leave you saying "I Like Ike"

Jean Edward Smith's biography of Grant provides an excellent summation of his life by looking at the areas that defined him as a person. This is by no means a comprehensive biography of his generalship or presidential years but it does a thorough job of hitting all of the highlights. I will not go into excessive detail about all of the topics covered but there area few notable things to point out that Smith does well.1. The Civil war years are covered succinctly and through the lens of how Grants leadership allowed his subordinates to achieve victory while he pushed them on to continue fighting.2. It seems that there is some adequate explanation of the bad judgments that Grant made during his White House years and Smith points out there was never "a businessman Grant did not trust" which led him astray during his White House years.3. This is one of the few books that spend some time on Grant's personal life and the role his wife and daughter played are covered well. It also covers his military relationships very clearly which helps to understand the years after the Civil War.Overall it is an excellent summary of Grant's life and well worth reading.

For those who want to understand one of the most devastating moments in American history this is an excellent book to start with. Winchester has written some of the best natural disaster books and he does not disappoint here. The San Francisco quake devastated a city that was not prepared. Like most of his books the first half takes you through why the geological events occur. As a person who lived only blocks away from the San Andreas Fault I found this incredibly interesting. This book will not be interesting to those who don't have at least a minor interesting in geology. You do not need to have any knowledge to enjoy it but you have to at least be willing to learn because he does go into scientific ideas. Overall though this book will make for an interesting read as you hear about how one of the largest cities on the west coast was nearly wiped from the map.

If you are looking for the best biography of a revolutionarily figure you have found it. Ron Chernow presents one of the best Americans who set this country on a course for success. His fiscal policies created a modern establishment that allowed the United States to develop economically and his ideas of funding at par set the United States in a position to receive favorable loans. Hamilton has earned his place on the ten dollar bill and this book provides the reasoning. If you want to learn how finance began, how our country grew or just why the federalists came to power then this is the book for you!

Wallner provides an excellent biography on the life of Franklin Peirce however this book does not include his time as president. It provides an excellent overview on how Pierce attained the presidency and his turbulent if unknown political career came to fruition. The book clearly assesses his role in helping to shape many political outcomes in New Hampshire and focuses a little on his time in the congress. What is truly impressive about Pierce and his attainment of the presidency is that he does not spend his entire life in public office. In fact he is out of office and serving mores a party leader than anything else for much of the time. As the author points out he is often in the right place at the right time. For those who want to learn a little more about Pierce the man this is a great place to start. Wallner's second book will take the reader into the presidency.

James Grant provides a refreshing new analysis of John Adams that captures his role in the revolution accurately. Adams developed as his own party throughout the years following the revolution. This book can truly stand on its own and covers all the years of Adams life. From his law days in Boston, to the drafting of the Massachusetts constitution to his years as a diplomat in Europe the early years are well covered. The second half looks closer at his time in high political office from vice presidency to presidency to the retirement years. Overall it tracks closely the integral characters of his life. From Abigail to John Quincy to Alexander Hamilton the author develops each well and shows how they impacted John Adams. The one drawback is there are a lot of modern references which are not needed however they are not enough to knock a full star off. If you want a new perspective on John Adams this is a great way to go.

For those who want to understand why Central Asia has been fought over in recent history Rajan Menon provides an invaluable tool. This book goes region by region utilizing the best authors in each. The book covers the individual countries in the Caspian regions as well as the future prospects for Russian and OPEC interaction there. It clearly lays out how the region has been developing and although a little dated at this point it still provides an excellent foundation. The authors that contribute are the best in their fields and Menon organizes the book very well. Highly recommend if you are interested in oil policy.

Parker Brothers have made some of the most memorable games and the story of how they came up with them and built an empire is fascinating. This is one of the great business books on the toy industry of which sadly there are few. No attention was placed to video games undercutting board games sloes but otherwise this covers everything you would want to know. The stories are great and the ideas for the games really come to life. For those who want to create board games or understand the toy industry this is a must read.

This is the best biography of Fidel Castro out there. It is the most through and covers the most information. Although Guerrilla Prince is better written this book does provide more detailed information on all aspects of his life. You can see development of childhood up through his dominance of power. Castro is one of the most interesting men in Latin America and whether you call him a dictator or a revolutionary this book covers him fairly. Highly recommend.

The Flat Tax is very controversial idea that has sparked Steve Forbes to run for the presidency in the past. It is a very interesting idea and one that would do this country a lot of good. Sadly it will never be implemented due to political pressures but it is still fun to read about. This is a very quick book to read that lays out why we need a flat tax and what the oppositions says about it. Steve Forbes addresses some of the big objections and the book is very interesting to read. Highly recommend if you are interested in public policy and want a fresh approach. Especially nice if you think the AMT is useless.

The Smartest Guys in the Room provides a comprehensive overview of the people behind the meltdown at Enron and the ideas that led a once great company to ruin. It is a story of greed, manipulation and egos that drove some of the "smartest" people in business to extraordinary ends. This book does assume a great deal of knowledge on financial tools and gets technical in its overview but having read several books on Enron this is one of the better ones. From the personality battles under Skilling in his dog eat dog world to the financial manipulations of Fastow that seem incredulous even today this book is very thorough. One of the most standout parts to me of this book is the look at Fastow's financial manipulations and his partnerships under JEDI and LJM 1 /2. These deals were so shockingly bad for Enron and their board of directors so inept that nothing was done to prevent the company from being looted millions of dollars. Much has already been said about this book by other reviewers but the key points are if you want something that shows the personalities behind the scandal, a detailed look at the financial undertakings of the company, and a fresh take on the story this is the book to go with. It is very easy to read, well written and moves at a great pace for those who want a thorough understanding of what went wrong at this fascinating company.

Bosworth in his book on Mussolini's Italy makes an effort to show how the fascist regime grew within the state and the extent to which it dominated the state. Fascism was not synonymous with Italian nationalism and Bosworth's explanations of the fascist growth lend credence to the idea that it was slow to take on. He categorizes fascism in various states and his most prevalent is the idea of a northern and southern fascism. This book also does an excellent job of showing how Mussolini's regime permeated the Italian state. The fascist ideals did meet significant resistance with the traditional liberals. The tough stance on labor and the opportunities for the church however drew many allies and allowed Mussolini to take power. One of the points lacking here is that the monarchy played a large role in his rise to power. I feel that Bosworth does not address that issue and I would like to have seen it done more.Overall this is the best attempt we have on fascist Italy however this book could have been done better. It is incredibly ambitious and either should have been broken into two books or made one book longer. There is a lot of information that is glazed over very quickly leaving some holes in the analysis. If you want an introduction to fascist Italy this is a great place to start but I would not stop here. There are many rich ways to explore the topic and looks at Ray Mosley's Mussolini's Shadow or Dennis Mack Smith's biography of Mussolini are great additions. Understanding how the fascist regime impacted the state and the world make for interesting questions and is something anyone studying World War II should not miss.

Kurlansky makes odd topics interesting and he does not fail with salt. Salt is truly one of the most important items in the history of the world. It has been essential in the development of civilization and has been fought over for centuries. The Middle East economy was built upon it and the fishing industries of Europe were essential. For those who are interested in how this vital commodity shaped the world this is a must read.

The confederacy's navy during the civil war is a very impressive display of piracy on the high sees. While most of the attention always focuses on the iron ships it is often forgotten that there were several others out there raiding the north's commerce. This book puts quantifiable numbers and daring high sees escapades onto the same page. It is a very fast read and one that gives a new perspective on the civil war. The South's daring strikes and the north's eventual efforts to hunt down and put a stop to these raiders are cataloged here and make for interesting reading. There is also a very interesting subset that looks at European policies towards the United States during this time period and a perspective that is not often gathered can be seen here. This is a must have for true civil war buffs.

Stephen Sears delivers an excellent account of the Peninsula Campaign waged by the Army of the Potomac aimed at capturing Richmond in 1862. The plan to use the navy to land and march to Richmond via Williamsburg was one of the most daring operations of the war and provided for two largely untested armies to engage in major combat. It was the highest number of soldiers committed on each sides and while not the bloodiest it comes close in terms of numbers lost. It sealed McCellan's fate and gave rise to Lee as her retooled the Army of Northern Virginia. This story also includes the famed clash between the Merrimack and Monitor that changed how naval warfare would be perceived until World War II. Sears writes very clear and easy to understand military campaigns that take into account domestic politics or north and south, naval conditions and the rise of the failed intelligence netowork under Pinkerton. For those who want a concise account of the march to Richmond there is no better than this one and I highly recommend it.

I had never heard of the Mississippi flood before picking up this book and I am surprised that I had never hard of it after reading about it. This is arguably the greatest natural disaster to hit the United States until Hurricane Katrina. To see the response of the government then and now there are shocking similarities The army corp of engineers makes a similar performance and it is through private enterprise and local political networks that areas are saved. One of the sadder points in the book is the treatment of African Americans and southern racism in this time period is clearly displayed in most areas. The flood which wiped out parts of Mississippi and spread down to New Orleans was catastrophic. Seeing the idea of detonating levees and sacrificing areas of save others were tough choices that have implications in the post Katrina world. This is a highly recommend book that will make one think about natural disaster response from a truly catastrophic event.

Reeves delivers an exciting and wonderful book that chronicles Nixon's presidential years. This book begins with Nixon entering office and ends on the day he leaves office. It goes day by day through the presidency and gives you a good sense of what the Nixon administration was thinking and what was happening in the country at the same time. From foreign policy with China and Russia to domestic problems like Kent State this book covers everything you would want to know about the Nixon Administration. It is easily five stars. The book is very readable and is a great reference guide for those who just want to learn about Nixon or those who want to study his administration in depth.

Thea Perdue adds an excellent addition to the Indians of the Southeast series by giving a new perspective on the role of women in Cherokee society. There are very few books that assess how women were affected by European invaders in a traditional society. The women existed in a matrilineal world where they controlled trade and social functions which are retold expertly here. Perdue recounts how war, diplomacy, and economics changed the roles of women and how the European viewpoints were dominant. The book ends with a look at the supposed Renaissance that occurred when missionaries from the Moravians began to work on a language and develop societal roles in Cherokee tribes.The literature on Indians of the Southeast, and Indians in general, is growing quickly and this will become a staple within the historiography. For those who want to look at the history of the Cherokee this is an invaluable source. Furthermore for those who want to look at matrilineal roles and how they affected European and Indian relations than this is a great way to study them.

Merck is one of the most honest drug companies in the world. Given their recent troubles with Vioxx it is good to have a book out there that reminds us of the good things they have done. Hawthorne as always is well written and does a great job of taking us from the founding with George Merck to the present day and the quest to create new drugs. It is an unbiased perspective that may make those who want to blame big Pharma for all of their ills. Highly recommend.

If you are planning a trip to Great Britain this is a good guide to start with. If you are just going to London and Scotland I would buy their individual books as this gets a little overbearing at times. If you are taking a tour of the whole Isle I would start with this book and then get more detailed ones as you progress. Also don't miss picking up a top 10 London from this company. It will help out quite a bit.

Although the information in this book is a bit dated as this branch of the IRS is no longer in use this book was an interesting read. It covers one of the most hated branches of the US government and one of the most hated parts of that branch. The need to feed the beast is well illustrated and how one can get sucked into that world is easily seen. Very interesting and scary look at what happens to those in power of our tax system.

This book seeks to understand how and why Argentina sank into financial chaos in the early 2000's. The book looks at the role of the IMF, US treasury, private markets, and the Argentinean government in the overall downfall of the country. The author writes very well about his subject and has a good understanding of international economics. The IMF is not completely vilified as it is in many of the current financial crisis's and although it shares a large amount of the blame the book hands it out equally. There is quite a bit of conspiracy theory and engaging in theories behind the IMF and Wall Street as well as the Bush administration. The author acknowledges in most cases that these are conspiracies but they did not really need to be discussed. The most interesting part of the story has to do with the role that the markets played in Argentina. It is an interesting foreshadow for the future of emerging markets and looking at the self fulfilling prophecies of debt and equity. This book deserves its credit for focusing on real issues without engaging in much ideology or theory. If you want to understand how financial markets are impacting areas overseas this is a great book to start with.

Like most management theory books this theory will probably be replaced by yet another but it does provide an interesting thought for human resources and management alike. The idea that you can unlock human potential by helping your employees maximize their work experience should be common sense. This book gives some great suggestions on how to start out along that path but like most business you will have to find your own. If you are interested in academic management this is probably a book that you will enjoy otherwise I would not waste your time.

There are a growing number of books on the gilded age in America and many paint the rising industrialists as crooks. In this case they got the image just right. Jay Gould used illegal tactics to build his empire and went as far as to corner the gold market using inside information. It is tactics like his that have inspired laws on wall street today. This is an excellent and well written biography about an interesting figure in our society. It does not lump in other industrialists with Gould and paints Gould in as fair a light as possible. It does extol some of his better virtues including a good business sense and a passion for the railroads. Gould was among the first robber barrons to rise to power and although later eclipsed by others he remains an important figure to read about today. This is essential for any Gilded Age library.

This is one of the most interesting stories in World War 2 history. The attempt by British Special Forces to destroy the Nazi nuclear reactor was a tremendous effort. Using Norwegian skiers who blended into the local background and destroyed the nuclear hard water reactor the mission was a success. This story also includes their dramatic escape and the second attempt at destroying a boat of hard water. This story is one that needs to be told and I highly recommend to everyone. Very well written and reads like a novel.

This is truly one of the most fascinating theories in ancient history. A volcano that shaped the modern world by forcing the migration of the huns, the crop failures in the Middle East that led to the rise of Islam and the start of the barbarian migrations towards Rome. It is almost too hard to summarize but if you believe that climate can change history than this is the book that will provide excellent evidence on that idea. Truly a masterpiece of an idea.

Coca-cola is an interesting company in its development. This book is the best one out of many on how Coca-Cola became what it is today. Even through it is arguably falling apart at the seems you can see how Coke stayed ahead of Pepsi and its early products during the years of development. The book tracks the days when coca-cola was thought of as a medicine. This is a must have for anyone interested in the soft drink industry or American culture as a whole. Very enjoyable and well written. It is the best book on the subject to date and will be very hard to top.

Google is one of the most fascinating companies that has developed out of the computer era. It has the reputation of gentleman and the whimsical fancy that one expects in Silicon Valley. To work for them is ideal. This book conveys all of those things and more. The idea that the founders were going to download the internet was laughable at the time but has been achieved. Their goal of do no evil has been applied all over and now one can search the world or the human DNA code. Their ability as a company is unmatched and this story is a must read for any one interested in the development of the internet.

This is one of the most challenging books on the French Revolution that I have read. It is very well written and takes a unique viewpoint. The idea is that the French Revolution happened within a context that influenced events across the world. Stone tackles a very big thesis in a small number of pages and overall does a nice job. I feel a lot more explaining could have been done but this is an idea that bears more work. If you are interested in the French revolution this is a great book to get you thinking about its impact. It is not for beginners. This is for those who have read and understood all the events of the French Revolution.

Target is one of the most popular retailers today and Rowley recounts their development from a Minnesota store to cross country superstar. This book is best read in conjunction with Sam Walton's made in America. Although it is fairly agreed upon today that Wal-Mart and Target do not compete with each other they did initially and the difference between the two is instructive. Target uses wider aisles as well as bigger floor space. Their selection is meant to be higher end and there goal was to capture middle class discounters. The stores development is well written and Rowley adds some of the fun stories along the way. This is a great book for those interested in retail and a very quick and fun read.

Sam Walton's book is a look inside the largest employer in the country after the government. Walton glazes over his more outrageous efforts at wiping out competition and gives some excellent analysis on how he built wal-mart. Walton is a person that it is easy to like despite what his company does and you get a sense that it is those who came after him that set up the atrocities that occur in their employment today. Overall this is a classic and is well worth a read for anyone in business.

A Colonial Complex provides a very interesting look at an often forgotten war in colonial America. The Yamasee War fought by the Indians that would become known as the creeks was a devastating conflict for both sides. It shaped the colonial mindset with regards to the Creeks and developed the role of the Cherokee for the future of colonial relations. It sets the stage for the development of Georgia as a colony and continues the erosion of Indian sovereignty by adding more boundaries to the creek nation. There are very few books that analyze the creek and almost none that take into account the Yamasee war. If you are interested in colonial affairs this is a must read. It is well written, concise and straight to the point.

Babbo provides a lot of upscale and time consuming recipes that do come out very well if you have the time. This is not for those learning how to cook and is really geared towards experienced cooks. The desserts are actually probably the most useful parts of the book. We have had a great deal of trouble finding ingredients in this book so if you don't have a lot of specialty grocery stores around this is probably not one to buy. Just a little too upscale for me and not enough recipes I can use.
